He is the author of a number of books about India, its mountains, rivers and its steam trains. His books are well loved because of their playful spirit and investigative attention to detail. For example, he demonstrates this in (page 122) of 'Footloose in the Himalayas', where he manages to locate and describe a packet of the famous Berinag tea with its logo from the 1930s. He thus preserves it in history with his words. Even as he drives through the tea estates of Dan Singh Bist he calls him by his local nickname 'maldar' and adroitly describes the unique taste of Chinese tea on Indian soil and its logo which has an Berinag girl in Chinese dress.page no.(252)\n\nBorn in Tullibody in Clackmannanshire, Scotland in 1934, Aitken attended Handsworth Grammar School Birmingham and completed his M.A in comparative religion at the University of Leeds.

{"id": "2206737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206737", "title": "Nurbanu Sultan", "text": "Nurbanu Sultan\n\nNurbanu Sultan (; 1525 – 7 December 1583) was Haseki Sultan of the Ottoman Empire as the principal consort of Sultan Selim II (reign 1566–1574), as well as Valide Sultan as the mother of Sultan Murad III (reign 1574–1595). She was one of the most prominent figures during the time of the Sultanate of Women. Conflicting theories ascribe her a Venetian, Jewish or Greek origin. Her birth name may have been Cecilia Venier-Baffo, Rachel or Kalē Kartanou.\n\nThere are several theories about the ethnic roots of Nurbanu, none of which is generally accepted:\n\nTurkish historian Ahmet Refik believed she was of Jewish descent, followed by some Turkish historians.\n\nIn 1900, Emilio Spagni claimed that she was a Venetian patrician, daughter of Nicolò Venier and Violanta Baffo, abducted on Paros when it was captured by Ottoman admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa in the Third Ottoman-Venetian War. The Sultana, herself, would often say she was of Venetian patrician descent, but never named her family.\n\nIn 1992, B. Arbel challenged the view that she was really of Venetian descent. For him, the most plausible theory is that she was a Greek from Corfou named Kale Kartanou.\n\nNurbanu became the most favored consort of Şehzade Selim (who became Ottoman Sultan as Selim II in 1566), and the mother of Şehzade Murad (the future Murad III, born 1546).\n\nWhile her spouse Selim was still a şehzade, Nurbanu had been the head of his princely harem at Manisa.\n\nOnce he beame sultan, Selim let his favorite wife, the haseki Nurbanu, remain at the Topkapı Palace throughout his reign, as his predecessor (Suleiman the Magnificent) had done.\n\nEven after Selim began to take other concubines, Nurbanu persisted as a favorite for her beauty and intelligence. As the mother of the heir-apparent, she acted as an advisor to her husband. Although it was far from normal at the time, Selim II would often ask Nurbanu for her advice on various subjects because of his respect for her good judgment. The Venetian ambassador Jacopo Soranzor reported: She became a formidable figure with far-reaching influence during this time. According to some sources (mostly Venetian accounts), her influence was such that Nurbanu Sultan effectively ran the government alongside the Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha. The Ottoman Empire was far from stable at the top, and clashes over the imperial throne were common. It was also not unusual for the loser in such contests to have his entire family massacred along with him to prevent any future challenges. Nurbanu Sultan was determined, however, that when the time came for her son to succeed his father, nothing would interfere with that.\n\nWhen Selim II's reign ended in 1574, the haseki Nurbanu received 1,100 aspers a day, while Selim's other consorts, each the mother of a son, received only 40 aspers.\n\nŞehzade Murad had been sent to serve as Governor of Manisa on the Aegean coast and was there when Sultan Selim II died in 1574. This would have been the perfect opportunity for someone to seize power with the Sultan dead and his son away from the capital. Nurbanu realized this as much, if not more, than anyone and took quick action. Security and privacy in the harem were the most strict anywhere and no one knew when Selim II had actually died. Nurbanu told no one and hid the dead body of her husband in an icebox and sent to Manisa for her son to come to Constantinople immediately. All the while no one was the wiser that Sultan Selim II had departed this life. It was not made known publicly until twelve days later when Murad arrived and Nurbanu delivered up the body of her late husband. Her son became Sultan Murad III and Nurbanu became Valide Sultan, the highest position a woman could hold in the Ottoman Empire. Unlike her predecessor Hürrem Sultan, Nurbanu outlived her husband and enjoyed absolute power between 1574 and 1583, although she was apparently not resident in the Palace after Selim II's death.\n\nUnder the influence of Nurbanu on the harem, her son Murad's great respect for her also played a role. In this way, the Sultanate became a high status and became an important and powerful position of the dynasty. Nurbanu's pocket money, which reaches high amounts among both dynastic members and high level officials, is considered as an indicator of this power. As valide sultan she was allocated 2000 coins daily.\n\nNurbanu had the ultimate power, and she became a formidable figure with far-reaching influence. Canfeda Hatun, Raziye Hatun, and Hubbi Hatun ladies-in-waiting to Murad and Nurbanu also appear to have been very powerful and influential during his reign.\n\nAfter Nurbanu became the valide sultan to her son Murad III, she effectively managed the government together with the Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, who acted as co-regent with the sultan during the Sultanate of Women.\n\nHer intermediary to the world outside the harem was her \"Kira\", Esther Handali. She corresponded with the queen Catherine de' Medici of France.\n\nIt is understood that Nurbanu Sultan used Kira Ester Handali of Jewish origin for his own personal affairs and had a financial relationship with Duke of Naxos Joseph Nassi. Perhaps, due to this network of relationships, the rumor has spread that he was of Jewish origin. Among her close men are Bâbüssaâde Ağası Gazanfer Ağa, the priest Şemsi Pasha, the strong figures of the harem that has been with him since Manisa, Canfeda Hatun and Raziye Hatun.\n\nVenetian accounts are the most prolific in describing Nurbanu Sultan as a woman who never forgot her Venetian origins. Reportedly, she kept in contact with Venice through her lady-in-waiting Chirana, who kept in regular contact with the Council of Ten in Venice, from whom she (Chirana) received an allowance as a Venetian Agent.\n\nDuring her nine years of regency (1574–1583), her politics were so pro-Venetian that she was hated by the Republic of Genoa. Some have even suggested that she was poisoned by a Genoese agent. In any case, she died at the palace in the Yenikapı Quarter, Istanbul on 7 December 1583.\n\nThis mosque complex was constructed by Mimar Sinan on a vast area. The component buildings in the complex were established on a number of successive and stepped flat levels. Buildings were constructed as the mosque, medresse, school, and the dervish lodge on two separate plains. To the west of these, on a lower flat level were erected the complex of buildings designed to meet social functions such as charity. The public bath is in the south. \n\nThe Darüşşifa (hospital), which constitutes the major concern of the present study, is an integral part of the mosque complex constructed by Mimar Sinan, the great Ottoman architect, under the auspices of Nurbanu Sultan between 1570 and 1579. The landed properties that Nurbanu Sultan devoted to the darüşşifa in her mosque complex are scattered over many corners of Istanbul, Rumelia, and Anatolia. Through the revenues remitted from these resources the treatments and needs of patients admitted to the darüşşifa were sponsored. A section specialized in the administration of revenues was also included in the darüşşifa premises. \n\nDuring her nine years of regency, Nurbanu ordered the renowned Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan to build the Atik Valide Mosque and its surrounding külliye at the district of Üsküdar in Istanbul, where previously a \"Jewish bath\" was located. The construction of the külliye was completed and put in commission at the end of 1583, just before the demise of Nurbanu on 7 December 1583.\nThe Atik Valide Complex comprises a mosque, medrese, primary school, convent for mystics, schools for Qur’an recitation and hadith scholars, soup kitchen, hospital, and bathhouse. Mimar Sinan conceived of his major mosques as finely tuned instruments meant to sound the Qur’an as a text-as-event, in a reenactment of the original revelation. He even integrated sounding vessels in the domes to ensure a beautiful performance of the holy text. Based on the endowment deed (vakfiye), one can reconstruct the soundscape Nurbanu created through her patronage. \n\nShe was buried at the mausoleum of her husband Selim II located inside the Hagia Sophia (then a mosque) at Sultanahmet in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nNurbanu died at Istanbul on December 7, 1583, during the reign of her son Murad III. She was buried next to Selim II in his mausoleum in the courtyard of Hagia Sophia, thus becoming the first wife of a Sultan to receive the honor of being laid to rest next to her spouse.\n\nPreceding Nurbanu's death, the Venetian ambassador in the Ottoman palace, Paolo Contarini had stated All goods and evils are coming from the mother queen. When Nurbanu died in December 1583, the successor of Contarini reported the following:\n\nWith Selim, Nurbanu is confirmed to have had at least four children, including:\nThough the claim remains disputed, several sources also mention her as the mother of:\n\nShe was portrayed by Turkish actress Merve Boluğur in television series \"Muhteşem Yüzyıl.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2206745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206745", "title": "Safwan ibn Umayya", "text": "Safwan ibn Umayya\n\nSafwan ibn Umayyah () (died 661) was a \"sahaba\" (companion) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nHe was from the Banu Jumah clan of the Quraysh tribe in Mecca. His father was Umayyah ibn Khalaf, one of the elders of the Quraysh; his mother was Karima bint Ma'mar ibn Habib. He had a paternal brother named Ali and a maternal brother named Jabala ibn al-Hanbal.\n\nSafwan married at least five times.\n\nOn request, he once loaned Muhammad 50,000 \"dirhams\".\n\nSafwan's father, Umayya ibn Khalaf, opposed Muhammad in Mecca. He was involved in the plot to assassinate Muhammad, after which Muhammad left for Medina. It was only after the Battle of Badr in March 624 that Safwan's opposition became active.\n\nSafwan did not fight at Badr (March 624). When the news that the Quraysh army had been routed there first reached Mecca, Safwan said that the messenger was out of his mind. But when the messenger was asked, \"What happened to Safwan ibn Umayya?\" he replied: \"There he is, sitting in the \"hijr\", and I witnessed the killing of his father and his brother!\"\n\nIn reaction to this, Safwan conspired with his cousin, Umayr ibn Wahb, to kill Muhammad. Safwan paid off Umayr's debts and took care of his family while Umayr went to Medina with his sword \"sharpened and poisoned\". Safwan promised the Quraysh that they would soon hear good news from Medina. But his plan backfired, for at the gate of the mosque, the Muslims recognized Umayr and brought him to Muhammad, who already knew the details of the plot. Umayr converted to Islam and returned to Mecca to preach and to \"make difficulties for them in their religion as I used to make difficulties for your companions in theirs.\" Safwan swore that he would never speak to Umayr again. Umayr was violent towards those who opposed his preaching, \"so that through him many became Muslims.\"\n\nIn November or December, Safwan and Abu Sufyan took a merchant-caravan of silver vessels worth 100,000 \"dirhams\" towards Iraq. Zayd ibn Harithah led a raid on this caravan, and they seized all the silver, although the Quraysh men escaped.\n\nSafwan then conferred with Abdullah ibn Abi Rabia and Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl. They \"walked with the men whose fathers, sons and brothers had been killed at Badr, and they spoke to Abu Sufyan and those who had merchandise in that caravan, saying, 'Men of the Quraysh, Muhammad has wronged you and killed your best men, so help us with this money to fight him, so that we may hope to get our revenge for those we have lost.'\" Safwan paid the poet Abu Azza to call up the Kinana tribes to rally to the Quraysh. The Quraysh \"gathered together to fight the apostle\" in March 625 in the event that became the Battle of Uhud.\n\nMany of the Quraysh commanders brought women to cheer on the army: Safwan took his two wives, Barza bint Mas'ud and al-Baghum bint al-Muadhdhil. During the battle he struck the death-blow to the injured Kharija ibn Zayd (father-in-law of Abu Bakr) and mutilated his body because Kharija had attacked Safwan's father at Badr. He also killed Aws ibn Arqam and Ibn Qawqal. After the battle, Safwan dissuaded the Quraysh from invading Medina; he said they were too tired to achieve anything, and there was no point, as they had already won the battle.\n\nIn August 625 men from Adal and Al-Qara brought to Mecca three Muslims whom they had captured. Safwan bought one of them, Zayd ibn Al-Dathinna, so that he could kill him in revenge for the death of his father at Badr. He sent him to Tanim to be killed outside the sanctuary there. Abu Sufyan asked him, \"Don't you wish, Zayd, that it was Muhammad who was in your place about to be killed and that you were at home with your family?\" Zayd replied, \"I would not wish so much as a thorn-prick on Muhammad, even if it would take me home to my family!\" As Safwan's servant Nistas killed Zayd, Abu Sufyan remarked, \"I never saw anyone as completely loved as Muhammad's companions love him.\"\n\nSafwan actively supported Abu Sufyan in planning and fund-raising for the Battle of the Trench.\n\nIn autumn 627 a merchant-caravan returning from Syria was carrying \"much silver\" belonging to Safwan. This caravan was intercepted at Al-'Is by Zayd ibn Haritha and 170 riders, who took the silver and several prisoners.\n\nWhen the Quraysh heard that 1600 Muslims were approaching Mecca in March 628, Safwan was one of the three leaders tasked with dealing with the situation. He sent Ikrima ibn Abi Jahl with 200 cavalry to muster support from surrounding tribes. When their allies arrived in Mecca, Safwan's house was one of the four hospitality points where the visitors could be fed, and when Uthman entered the city, Safwan was among those who greeted him. These events led to the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah.\n\nShortly afterwards, Muhammad ordered Muslim men to divorce any of their wives who were still pagans. One woman so divorced was Umar's wife, Umm Kulthum bint Jarwal. When she returned to Mecca, Safwan married her.\n\nMeanwhile, Muhammad besieged Khaybar. The Quraysh elders took bets on who would win this battle: Safwan bet five camels that Muhammad would lose, and was angry when Abu Sufyan expressed scepticism. Afterwards Khalid ibn Al-Walid converted to Islam and invited Safwan to accompany him to Medina because, \"We are the main fodder. Muhammad is victorious over the Arabs and non-Arabs.\" Safwan refused \"with great aversion,\" saying, \"Even if I were the only Qurashi alive, I would never follow him!\" According to the terms of the treaty, Muhammad arrived in Mecca in March 629 for the minor pilgrimage. When Bilal called the Muslims to prayer from the Kaaba, Safwan exclaimed, \"Praise God for letting my father die before he could see this!\"\n\nWhen the Bedouin chiefs, Farwa ibn Hubayra al-Qushayri and Nawfal ibn Muawiyah al-Dili, visited Mecca, they met with Safwan and other Quraysh elders. The Bedouin suggested that the Quraysh could unite with various Bedouin tribes and \"attack [Muhammad] in the heart of his homeland.\" Since it would be impracticable to plot against Muhammad before they had first suppressed his Meccan allies, the Khuza'a, the Bedouin said they should attack the Khuza'a first. But Safwan and the others said they dared not breach the treaty, so they did not accept the plot.\n\nIn 629 the Dil clan of the Bakr tribe took revenge against the Khuza'a. Safwan and his slaves lent them weapons and assisted the attack. As the Bakr were allied to the Quraysh and the Khuza'a to the Muslims in Medina, this was a breach of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, and it triggered the Conquest of Mecca.\n\nAs the Muslim army surrounded Mecca in January 630, Safwan joined Ikrima ibn Abi Jahl in the final resistance to Muhammad at Al-Khandama. There they encountered Khalid ibn al-Walid, who routed them.\n\nSafwan's wife Fakhita converted to Islam, but Safwan fled to Jeddah, intending to sail to Yemen. Before his ship departed, he was intercepted by Umayr ibn Wahb, who presented him with Muhammad's turban and said, \"Safwan, do not destroy yourself! I have brought you a token of safe-conduct from Allah's Messenger.\" At first Safwan told him to go away, but Umayr persisted, saying, \"Your cousin is the most excellent, righteous and forbearing of men. His strength is your strength, his honour is your honour, and his dominion is your dominion.\" Safwan replied that he was \"in mortal fear\" of Muhammad, but Umayr repeated that he was too generous and forbearing to think of killing him, and in the end Safwan agreed to return to Mecca with Umayr. Muhammad confirmed that he had indeed granted safe-conduct to Safwan. When Safwan asked for two months to consider his options, Muhammad replied that he might have four months.\n\nA few weeks later, Safwan received a message from Muhammad, asking for the loan of his weapons and armour \"that we may fight our enemy tomorrow.\" Safwan asked if Muhammad intended to force him to hand over the weapons; but on being told that it was only a friendly request and that his possessions would be returned, he replied that he had no objection. He arranged for the transport of a hundred coats of mail and other weapons for Muhammad's attack on the Hawazin at Hunayn. Safwan fought for Muhammad both at Hunayn, during which battle he remarked to his brother, \"I would rather be ruled by a man from Quraysh than a man from Hawazin,\" and at the Siege of Ta'if.\n\nSoon afterwards Safwan was among the \"certain men of eminence\" to whom Muhammad gave gifts \"in order to conciliate them and win over their hearts.\" Safwan received a hundred camels. After Safwan's conversion, his wife Fakhita returned to live with him.\n\nIt was said that Safwan \"always remained a good Muslim,\" and he narrated traditions about Muhammad. One example occurred when he went to a party hosted by the family of Muhammad ibn Al-Fadl ibn Al-Abbas. When the food was served, he said, \"Eat the meat with your front teeth, for I heard the Prophet say, 'Eat meat with your front teeth, for it is more appetizing, more wholesome and more enjoyable like that.'\"\n\nHowever, he did not participate in any of the Islamic military campaigns. Nor did he emigrate to Medina but remained in Mecca until his death in c.661.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2206759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206759", "title": "Curtis Jones", "text": "Curtis Jones\n\nCurtis Alan Jones (born April 26, 1967) is an American singer, songwriter and record producer. His style of house and techno music has been compared to and inspired by the likes of Kraftwerk, Prince, Gary Numan, and Nitzer Ebb.\n\nJones is also known as Cajmere, Geo Vogt, Green Velvet, Half Pint, Curan Stone, and Gino Vittori.\n\nBefore becoming a professional musician, Jones studied chemical engineering at the University of Illinois. In 1991, he left a Master's program at UC-Berkeley to move back to Chicago, releasing his first song (\"Coffee Pot\" on ClubHouse Records) the same year. Up until this point, music had been a hobby fueled by cobbling together tracks on his \"sixty-buck keyboard, a cheap four-track and a cheap drum machine\" set-up while still an undergraduate at the University of Illinois. This DIY method of production was never taken seriously, and when childhood plans to become a doctor were shelved, Jones was firmly committed to a career as a chemical engineer. His father was an occasional DJ and eventually became a budding musician. As time went on, Jones discovered what was his innate love and understanding for house music, a sound that had grown throughout the mid-1980s out of Chicago's deep-rooted house music scene. He played the saxophone at school and had a talent for trying to play with a keyboard but remained largely un-interested in what he saw as his father's passion. It was this cut-up and tacky production style of the early house sound that Jones absorbed and translated into the \"Underground Goodies\" EP, his first release as Cajmere (the CAJ derived from the artist's initials) ) put out in 1991 on his own recently started Cajual label. A year later he had his first massive hit as Cajmere with the house tune \"Coffee Pot (It's Time for the Percolator),\" which was also released on Cajual and distributed by NYC-based Emotive Records. He then teamed up with Chicago-based vocalist Dajae for \"Brighter Days,\" which entered #2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Music/Club Play, a high-impact and mellower house tune that was released on Cajual and distributed by NYC-based Emotive Records.\n\nInterested in making something totally different from his Cajmere moniker and other work, Curtis created Relief as an offshoot to his Cajual records in 1993. The first Relief release was also his first Green Velvet production, 1993's \"Velvet Tracks,\" which came from a name given to him by a girlfriend's father, emerged as the flamboyant, neon-haired electro punk, although in interviews he denied being linked to the Punk lifestyle and fashion, as he was more inspired by the likes of David Bowie and Sly and the Family Stone, he created mid-1990s hits such as \"Preacher Man,\" on which a Moral Majority-type of preacher spoke (the Reverend Trotter, not, contrary to popular belief, Reverend Franklin); \"Answering Machine,\" a darkly funny house track consisting of taped messages from an answering machine, including a bad news message from a girlfriend and a noise complaint message from his landlord—all made with Jones's voice; and \"Flash,\" which was a #1 US dance hit in 1995 and was included on many DJ-mixed compilation albums. After DJing under both of his now infamous monikers, he released his first album, \"Constant Chaos\", with Belgian Music label Music Man in 1999, which showed Green Velvet's style of house progress into styles similar to Prince and Kraftwerk, his spoken-word monologues also took a bizarre turn. In \"Abduction\" he spoke about little green men turning up while washing dishes.\n\nBy the time \"Constant Chaos\" was released, Jones had temporarily halted activity on his labels for almost a year. Still DJing as Cajmere he'd narrowed the Green Velvet persona down to live performances only, taking time out to re-group and work out what to do next. During 2000, Jones was briefly signed to Warner Bros. Records' short-lived F-111 imprint, where he released his second compilation album, the self-titled \"Green Velvet\", which contained the double-A-sided single \"Flash\" backed with \"Answering Machine\". During this time he gave Velvet a new hairstyle—from spiked, green foam nodules to yellow mohawk. Next, in 2001, he unleashed his second album, the dark \"Whatever\", which was a step away from his Kraftwerk-inspired sound (although \"Sleepwalking\" had a similar style) to a darker, more political Punk-esque style. On the album he tackled such issues as racism (highlighted on the song \"When?\"), drug use (highlighted on \"Genedefekt\" and \"La La Land\"), alienation (highlighted on \"Sleepwalking\"), and being told what to wear and do by \"the system\" (highlighted on the heavily punk-inspired track \"Gat\"). The more punk-oriented songs on the album apparently came from hours spent listening to industrial bands such as Nitzer Ebb and Liaisons Dangereuses, and lots of \"underground American industrial stuff.\" He released the single \"La La Land\" in 2001, originally designed as a wake-up call for clubbers to the dangers of pill-taking it became one of his most popular tunes. This was followed by \"Genedefekt\". His live act had now became more like a rock band also, with the Curtis playing a keytar, and two other musicians (aptly named Nazuk and Spaceboy) backing him, playing heavily distorted synths. Initially Jones, as both Cajmere and Green Velvet, was receiving more attention in Europe than he did in the USA, playing a Radio One live session on the Jo Whiley show and playing a host of festivals.\n\nAfter appearing under a host of different names for his various remixing and side projects, Green Velvet released his third album, \"Walk In Love\", in 2005. This album had a more house music-oriented style to it, but the odd Prince- and Punk-sounding tracks still remained, as Curtis actually got a live guitarist to play on \"Come Back\" and the closing track \"Pin-Up Girl\" had a similarity to New York-based Electroclash group Fischerspooner. After \"Walk In Love\", Green Velvet produced and remixed releases for fellow Relief Records artists and himself, and played a host of DJ session live shows in 2006.\n\nAfter staying quiet in the music scene, Green Velvet revealed in 2006 he had become a born-again Christian after a serious overdose of a mixture of Magic Mushrooms, Marijuana and (allegedly) GHB, and promised to turn his life around after this incident. His latest release, the single \"Shake and Pop\", is a departure from the recent darker electronica style, as he claims he has found a brighter future since converting. In 2007, he released the online-only track \"Love Peace, Not War\", a short ditty in response to the United States' war in Iraq.\n\nIn 2014, Green Velvet joined forces with the head of Dirtybird Records, Claude VonStroke (another veteran artist who grew up in the Mid-West), to form a side project known as Get Real. With both having a noticeable impact on both the house and techno scenes, many wondered why this duo didn't happen sooner. In reality, the project was by accident. A recent interview with Claude revealed that the duo met for only their second time during the Winter Music Conference in Miami. There, the two were accidentally scheduled simultaneously and they decided to make the best of the situation. It couldn't have turned out better. Their first release came out as an EP on Claude's label, with the appearance of “Mind Yo Bizness” and “Snuffaluffagus\". Claude has stated, \"Nobody is trying to steal the spotlight or take over the project which isn’t always the case in a duo. We each represent our style but we make a new style by working together.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Céline Dion's \"Think Twice\", which was released in October 1994 yet took until the end of January to reach the top, was the first UK number 1 single not to be available on vinyl in any form.\n\nAround the middle of the year, the way singles entered the chart started to change. Instead of entering low and climbing up to their peak, singles would now usually enter at their peak, and then fall down the chart. In May, Robson & Jerome became the first British act to reach number 1 with \"Unchained Melody\", after having sung the song on the ITV programme \"Soldier Soldier\". In May, music featured in an advertising campaign for Guinness reached number 2 – mambo tune \"Guaglione\" by Pérez Prado was a massive hit and the advert featured on an accompanying screensaver.\n\nThis was also the year which saw Britpop at its most popular. A highly publicised chart battle in August saw Oasis and Blur battling it out for the number 1 position, having both released their singles on the same day. Blur won the singles battle, with \"Country House\" beating Oasis' \"Roll with It\" to the top spot, but Oasis, with \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\", would go on to greatly outsell Blur's album, the album of which would eventually become the second biggest album in the UK. After a decade in the business Pulp secured a first number one album while Britpop elder statesman Paul Weller also benefited from a return to popular and critical favour.\n\nSingles that went on to sell over a million copies were Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise\", the first rap single to sell over a million in the UK, both of Robson & Jerome's songs (\"Unchained Melody\" / \"White Cliffs of Dover\", the biggest selling single of the year, and \"I Believe\" / \"Up on the Roof\") and Michael Jackson's \"Earth Song\". In addition, a second remix of New Order's \"Blue Monday\" (reaching number 17) pushed sales of that song over a million as well.\n\nIn all, there were 17 number one singles in 1995. As the 1990s continued the amount started to increase, and there wouldn't be a total as low as 1995's.\n\nComposer Michael Tippett celebrated his ninetieth birthday on 2 January. the occasion was marked by special events in Britain, Canada and the US, including the premiere of his final work, \"The Rose Lake\".

{"id": "2206778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206778", "title": "Untitled (The Byrds album)", "text": "Untitled (The Byrds album)\n\n(Untitled) is the ninth album by the American rock band the Byrds and was released in September 1970 on Columbia Records (\"see\" 1970 in music). It is a double album, with the first LP featuring live concert recordings from early 1970, and a second disc consisting of new studio recordings. The album represented the first official release of any live recordings by the band, as well as the first appearance on a Byrds' record of new recruit Skip Battin, who had replaced the band's previous bass player, John York, in late 1969.\n\nThe studio album mostly consisted of newly written, self-penned material, including a number of songs that had been composed by band leader Roger McGuinn and Broadway theatre director Jacques Levy for a planned country rock musical that the pair were developing. The production was to have been based on Henrik Ibsen's \"Peer Gynt\" and staged under the title of \"Gene Tryp\" (an anagram of Ibsen's play), but plans for the musical fell through. Five of the songs that had been intended for \"Gene Tryp\" were instead recorded by the Byrds for \"(Untitled)\"—although only four appeared in the album's final running order.\n\nThe album peaked at number 40 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart and reached number 11 on the UK Albums Chart. A single taken from the album, \"Chestnut Mare\" b/w \"Just a Season\", was released in the U.S. in October 1970, but missed the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, bubbling under at number 121. The single was later released in the UK in January 1971, where it did considerably better, reaching number 19 on the UK Singles Chart. Upon release, \"(Untitled)\" was met with positive reviews and strong sales, with many critics and fans regarding the album as a return to form for the band. Likewise, the album is today generally regarded by critics as being the best that the latter-day line-up of the Byrds produced.\n\nFollowing the dismissal of the Byrds' bass player, John York, in September 1969, Skip Battin was recruited as a replacement at the suggestion of drummer Gene Parsons and guitarist Clarence White. Battin was, at 35, the oldest member of the band and the one with the longest musical history. Battin's professional career in music had begun in 1959, as one half of the pop music duo Skip & Flip. The duo had notched up a string of hits between 1959 and 1961, including \"It Was I\", \"Fancy Nancy\", and \"Cherry Pie\". After the break-up of Skip & Flip, Battin moved to Los Angeles, where he worked as a freelance session musician and formed the band Evergreen Blueshoes. Following the disbandment of that group, Battin returned to session work in the late 1960s and it was during this period that he met Gene Parsons and became reacquainted with Clarence White, whom he had known from a few years earlier. York's dismissal and Battin's recruitment marked the last line-up change to the Byrds for almost three years, until Parsons was fired by McGuinn in July 1972. Thus, the McGuinn, White, Parsons, and Battin line-up of the band was the most stable and longest lived of any configuration of the Byrds.\n\nFor most of 1969, the Byrds' leader and guitarist, Roger McGuinn, had been developing a country rock stage production of Henrik Ibsen's \"Peer Gynt\" with former psychologist and Broadway impresario Jacques Levy. The musical was to be titled \"Gene Tryp\", an anagram of the title of Ibsen's play, and would loosely follow the storyline of \"Peer Gynt\", with some modifications to transpose the action from Norway to south-west America during the mid-19th century. The musical was intended as a prelude to even loftier plans of McGuinn's to produce a science-fiction film, tentatively titled \"Ecology 70\" and starring former Byrd Gram Parsons (unrelated to Gene Parsons) and ex-member of the Mamas & the Papas, Michelle Phillips, as a pair of intergalactic flower children. Ultimately, \"Gene Tryp\" was abandoned and a handful of the songs that McGuinn and Levy had written for the project would instead see release on \"(Untitled)\" and its follow-up, \"Byrdmaniax\".\n\nOf the twenty-six songs that were written for the musical, \"Chestnut Mare\", \"Lover of the Bayou\", \"All the Things\", and \"Just a Season\" were included on \"(Untitled)\", while \"Kathleen's Song\" and \"I Wanna Grow Up to Be a Politician\" were held over for the Byrds' next album. \"Lover of the Bayou\" would later be re-recorded by McGuinn in 1975 and appear on his \"Roger McGuinn & Band\" album.\n\nDespite not being staged at the time, \"Gene Tryp\" was eventually performed in a revised configuration by the drama students of Colgate University, between November 18 and November 21, 1992, under the new title of \"Just a Season: A Romance of the Old West\".\n\nHaving toured extensively throughout 1969 and early 1970, the Byrds decided that the time was right to issue a live album. At the same time, it was felt that the band had a sufficient backlog of new compositions to warrant the recording of a new studio album. The dilemma was resolved when it was suggested by producer Terry Melcher that the band should release a double album, featuring an LP of concert recordings and an LP of new studio recordings, which would retail for the same price as a regular single album. At around this same time, the band's original manager Jim Dickson, who had been fired by the group in June 1967, returned to the Byrds' camp to help Melcher with the editing of the live recordings, affording him a co-producers credit on \"(Untitled)\".\n\nThe album's innominate title actually came about by accident. According to Jim Bickhart's liner notes on the original double album sleeve, the group's intention was to name the release something more grandiose, such as \"Phoenix\" or \"The Byrds' First Album\". These working titles were intended to signify the artistic rebirth that the band felt the album represented. Another proposed title for the album was \"McGuinn, White, Parsons and Battin\", but McGuinn felt that this title might be misinterpreted by the public. The band still had not made up their minds regarding a title when Melcher, while filling out record company documentation for the album sessions, wrote the placeholder \"(Untitled)\" in a box specifying the album's title. A misunderstanding ensued and before anyone associated with the band had realized, Columbia Records had pressed up the album with that title, including the parentheses.\n\nThe latter-day line-up of the Byrds, featuring McGuinn, White, Parsons, and Battin, was regarded by critics and audiences as being much more accomplished in concert than previous configurations of the band had been. This being the case, it made perfect sense to capture their sound in a live environment, and so two consecutive New York concert appearances were recorded. The first of these was the band's performance at Queens College's Colden Center Auditorium on February 28, 1970, and the second was their performance at the Felt Forum on March 1, 1970.\n\n\"(Untitled)\" featured recordings from both of these concerts, spliced together to give the impression of a single continuous performance. Of the seven live tracks featured on the album, \"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\", \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", \"Mr. Spaceman\", and \"Eight Miles High\" were drawn from the Queens College performance, while \"Lover of the Bayou\", \"Positively 4th Street\", and \"Nashville West\" originated from the Felt Forum show. Byrds biographer Johnny Rogan has suggested that the appearance of the band's earlier hit singles \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", \"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\", and \"Eight Miles High\" on the live record had the effect of forging a spiritual and musical link between the band's current line-up and the original mid-1960s incarnation of the band.\n\nThe opening track of the live LP is \"Lover of the Bayou\", a new song written by McGuinn and Levy for their aborted \"Gene Tryp\" stage show. The song is set during the American Civil War and was intended for a scene in which the eponymous hero of the musical is working as a smuggler, bootlegger, and gun runner for both the Confederacy and the Unionists. Despite the central character's appearance in the scene, McGuinn explained in a 1970 interview with journalist Vincent Flanders that the song wasn't actually intended to be sung by Gene Tryp, but by another character, a voodoo witch-doctor (or houngan) named Big Cat.\n\n\"Lover of the Bayou\" is followed on the album by a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Positively 4th Street\", which would be the last Dylan song that the Byrds covered on an album until \"Paths of Victory\", which was recorded during the 1990 reunion sessions featured on \"The Byrds\" box set. The remainder of side one of \"(Untitled)\" is made up of live versions of album tracks and earlier hits. In a 1999 interview with journalist David Fricke, McGuinn explained the rationale behind the inclusion of earlier Byrds' material on the album: \"The live album was Melcher's way of repackaging some of the hits in a viable way. Actually, I wanted the studio stuff to come first. Terry wouldn't hear of it.\"\n\nSide two of the live album is taken up in its entirety by a sixteen-minute, extended version of \"Eight Miles High\", which proved to be popular on progressive rock radio during the early 1970s. The track is highlighted by the dramatic guitar interplay between McGuinn and White, as well as the intricate bass and drum playing of Battin and Parsons. The song begins with improvisational jamming, which lasts for over twelve minutes and culminates in an iteration of the song's first verse. Rogan has stated the opinion that the revamping of \"Eight Miles High\" featured on \"(Untitled)\" represented the ultimate fusion of the original Byrds and the newer line-up. At the end of this live performance of \"Eight Miles High\", the band can be heard playing a rendition of their signature stage tune, \"Hold It\", which had first been heard on record at the close of the \"My Back Pages/B.J. Blues/Baby What You Want Me to Do\" medley included on \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\".\n\nAdditional live material from the Byrds' early 1970 appearances at Queens College and the Felt Forum has been officially released over the years. \"Lover of the Bayou\", \"Black Mountain Rag (Soldier's Joy)\", and a cover of Lowell George's \"Willin'\", taken from the Queens College concert, were included on \"The Byrds\" box set in 1990. Additionally, performances of \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\", \"Old Blue\", \"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\", \"Ballad of Easy Rider\", \"My Back Pages\", and \"This Wheel's on Fire\" from the Felt Forum show were included on the expanded \"(Untitled)/(Unissued)\" release in 2000. A further two songs, \"You All Look Alike\" and \"Nashville West\", taken from the Queen's College concert were included on the 2006 box set, \"There Is a Season\".\n\nThe studio recording sessions for \"(Untitled)\" were produced by Terry Melcher and took place between May 26 and June 11, 1970 at Columbia Studios in Hollywood, California. Melcher had been the producer of the Byrds' first two albums in 1965, \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\", as well as producer of their previous LP, \"Ballad of Easy Rider\". The majority of the songs included on the studio album were penned by the band members themselves, in stark contrast to their previous album, which had largely consisted of cover versions or renditions of traditional material.\n\nAmong the songs recorded for the album were Parsons and Battin's \"Yesterday's Train\", a gentle meditation on the theme of reincarnation; a cover of Lowell George and Bill Payne's \"Truck Stop Girl\", sung by Clarence White; and a light-hearted reading of Lead Belly's \"Take a Whiff on Me\". The album also included the Battin-penned \"Well Come Back Home\", a heartfelt comment on the Vietnam War. Battin explained the song's genesis to Rogan during a 1979 interview: \"I was personally touched by the Vietnam situation, and my feelings about it came out in that song. I had a high school friend who died out there and I guess my thoughts were on him at the time.\" Battin also revealed in the same interview that he couldn't decide whether to name the song \"Well Come Back Home\" or \"Welcome Back Home\", but finally settled on the former. Curiously, although the song was listed on the original album and the original CD issue of \"(Untitled)\" as \"Well Come Back Home\", it was listed as \"Welcome Back Home\" on the \"(Untitled)/(Unissued)\" re-release in 2000, possibly in error. With a running time of 7:40, the song is the longest studio recording in the Byrds' entire oeuvre. In addition, the song also continues the tradition of ending the Byrds' albums on an unusual note, with Battin chanting the Nichiren Buddhist mantra \"Nam Myoho Renge Kyo\" towards the end of the song.\n\n\"Chestnut Mare\" had originally been written during 1969 for the abandoned \"Gene Tryp\" stage production. The song was intended to be used in a scene where Gene Tryp attempts to catch and tame a wild horse, a scene that had originally featured a deer in Ibsen's \"Peer Gynt\". Although the majority of \"Chestnut Mare\" had been written specifically for \"Gene Tryp\", the lilting Bach-like middle section had actually been written by McGuinn back in the early 1960s, while on tour in South America as a member of the Chad Mitchell Trio.\n\nTwo other songs originally intended for \"Gene Tryp\" were also included on the studio half of \"(Untitled)\": \"All the Things\", which included an uncredited appearance by former Byrd Gram Parsons on backing vocals, and \"Just a Season\", which was written for a scene in which the eponymous hero of the musical circumnavigates the globe. Lyrically, \"Just a Season\" touches on a variety of different subjects, including reincarnation, life's journey, fleeting romantic encounters and finally, stardom, as touchingly illustrated by the semi-autobiographical line, \"It really wasn't hard to be a star.\"\n\nThe album also includes the song \"Hungry Planet\", which was written by Battin and record producer, songwriter, and impresario Kim Fowley. The song is one of two Battin–Fowley collaborations included on \"(Untitled)\" and features a lead vocal performance by McGuinn. The ecological theme present in the song's lyrics appealed to McGuinn, who received a co-writing credit after he completely restructured its melody prior to recording. Journalist Matthew Greenwald, writing for the AllMusic website, has described \"Hungry Planet\" as having an underlying psychedelic atmosphere, which is enhanced by the sound of the Moog modular synthesizer (played by McGuinn) and the addition of earthquake sound effects. The album's second Battin–Fowley penned song, \"You All Look Alike\", was again sung by McGuinn and provided a sardonic view of the plight of the hippie in American society.\n\nThere were six other songs that were attempted during the \"(Untitled)\" recording sessions, but were not present in the album's final running order. Of these, \"Kathleen's Song\" would be held over until \"Byrdmaniax\", a cover of Dylan's \"Just Like a Woman\" would not be issued until the release of \"The Byrds\" box set in 1990, and a second Lowell George song, \"Willin'\", along with John Newton's Christian hymn \"Amazing Grace\" were eventually issued as bonus tracks on the \"(Untitled)/(Unissued)\" re-release in 2000 (\"Amazing Grace\" appearing as a hidden track). Additionally, an improvised jam was recorded during the album sessions and was logged in the Columbia files under the title of \"Fifteen Minute Jam\". Two different excerpts from this jam were later issued on \"The Byrds\" box set and \"(Untitled)/(Unissued)\", where they were given the retronyms of \"White's Lightning Pt.1\" and \"White's Lightning Pt.2\" respectively.\n\nOne other song attempted in the studio, but not included on \"(Untitled)\", was a cover of Dylan's \"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\". As of 20, this track has never been officially released, although a live version is included on \"(Untitled)/(Unissued)\". \"Lover of the Bayou\" was also recorded during studio sessions for \"(Untitled)\", but ultimately, a live recording of the song would be included on the album instead, with the studio recording appearing for the first time on the \"(Untitled)/(Unissued)\" reissue.\n\n\"(Untitled)\" was released on September 14, 1970 in the United States (catalogue item G 30127) and November 13, 1970 in the United Kingdom (catalogue item S 64095). Despite being a double album release, it retailed at a price similar to that of a single album, in an attempt to provide value for money and increase sales. The album peaked at number 40 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart during a stay of twenty-one weeks. It reached number 11 in the United Kingdom, where it spent a total of four weeks on the charts. The \"Chestnut Mare\" single was released some weeks after the album, on October 23, 1970, and bubbled under at number 121 on the \"Billboard\" singles chart. It fared better when it was released in the UK on January 1, 1971, reaching number 19 on the UK Singles Chart, during a chart stay of eight weeks. \"Chestnut Mare\" went on to become a staple of FM radio programming in America during the 1970s.\n\nAlthough \"(Untitled)\" was released exclusively in stereo commercially, there is some evidence to suggest that mono copies of the album (possibly radio station promos) were distributed in the U.S. In addition, there are advance promo copies of the album known to exist which list both \"Kathleen's Song\" and \"Hold It\" as being on the album: the former under the simplified title of \"Kathleen\" and the latter as \"Tag\". While \"Hold It\" does indeed appear on the official album release, at the end of the live recording of \"Eight Miles High\", it was not listed as a separate track on commercially released copies of the album. \"Kathleen's Song\", however, was not included in the album's final running order.\n\nThe album cover artwork was designed by Eve Babitz and featured photographs taken by Nancy Chester of the Byrds upon the steps of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, with the view of L.A. that originally made up the background being replaced by a desert scene. When the double album gatefold sleeve was opened up, the front and back cover photographs were mirrored symmetrically in a style reminiscent of the work of graphic artist M. C. Escher. The inside gatefold featured four individual black & white photographic portraits of the band members, along with liner notes written by Jim Bickhart and Derek Taylor.\n\n\"(Untitled)\" is the only double album to be released by the Byrds (excluding later compilations) and is therefore the band's longest album by far. In fact, the studio LP alone, which has a running time of roughly 38 minutes, is longer than any other Byrds album—despite containing fewer tracks than any of the band's other albums.\n\nUpon its release, \"(Untitled)\" was met with widespread critical acclaim and strong international sales, with advance orders alone accounting for the sale of 100,000 copies. The album's success continued the revival of the band's commercial fortunes that had begun with the release of their previous album, \"Ballad of Easy Rider\". Many fans at the time regarded the album as a return to greatness for the Byrds and this opinion was echoed by many journalists.\n\nBud Scoppa, writing in the November 16, 1970 edition of \"Rock\" magazine, described the album as \"easily their best recorded performance so far – in its own class as much as the records of the old Byrds were – and I think one of the best half-dozen albums of 1970.\" Ben Edmonds' review in the December issue of \"Fusion\" magazine was also full of praise: \"\"(Untitled)\" is a joyous re-affirmation of life; it is the story of a band reborn. The Byrds continue to grow musically and lead stylistically, but they do so with an unailing sense of their past.\" Edmonds concluded his review by noting that, \"History will no doubt bear out the significance of the Byrds' contribution to American popular music, but, for the time being, such speculations are worthless because \"(Untitled)\" says that the Byrds will be making their distinctive contributions for quite some time to come.\"\n\nIn a contemporary review for \"Jazz & Pop\" magazine, Bruce Harris declared that the album \"brings the Byrds back as the super cosmic-cowboys of all time, and is without question their greatest achievement since \"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\".\" However, Lester Bangs was less enthusiastic about the album in his review for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine: \"This double album set is probably the most perplexing album the Byrds have ever made. Some of it is fantastic and some is very poor or seemingly indifferent (which is worse), and between the stuff that will rank with their best and the born outtakes lies a lot of rather watery music, which is hard to find much fault with but still harder for even a diehard Byrds freak to work up any enthusiasm about.\" In a negative review for \"The Village Voice\" in 1971, Robert Christgau found the songs \"unarresting\", their harmonies \"weak or just absent\", and the live performances poorly captured on vinyl.\n\nIn the UK, \"Disc\" magazine hailed the album as \"probably the most intelligent collection of songs ever assembled on a double LP... The Byrds show they retain all their imagination yet at the same time retain their unique sound.\" Roy Carr, writing in the \"NME\", commented that, \"the Byrds still retain an artistry and freshness unmatched by most others in their genius. Even changes in personnel and direction haven't dulled their appeal or magical charms.\" Yet another complimentary review came from the pen of Richard Williams, who described the album as \"simply their most satisfying work to date\" in his review for the \"Melody Maker\".\n\nIn his review of the album for AllMusic, Bruce Eder said that although \"(Untitled)\" was always considered by fans to be \"the one to own\" among the band's post-1968 output, it has, since its initial release, risen in the estimation of some critics more than any other Byrds' album. Eder goes on to attempt to evaluate the album's significance within the context of the Byrds' back catalogue: \"listening to this album nearly 40 years later, it now seems as though this is the place where the latter-day version of the group finally justified itself as something more important than just a continuation of the mid-'60s band.\" In his 2000 review for \"The Austin Chronicle\", Raoul Hernandez described it as, \"beginning with a biting live set before giving way to a studio side of crackling Americana fare.\"\n\n\"(Untitled)\" was remastered at 20-bit resolution as part of the Columbia/Legacy Byrds series. It was reissued in an expanded form with the new title of \"(Untitled)/(Unissued)\" on February 22, 2000. The remastered reissue of the album contains an entire bonus CD of previously unreleased live and studio material from the period. The six studio based bonus tracks on the reissue include alternate versions of \"All the Things\", \"Yesterday's Train\", and \"Lover of the Bayou\", along with the outtake \"Kathleen's Song\". The remaining eight bonus tracks are live recordings taken from the Byrds' concerts on March 1, 1970 at the Felt Forum and September 23, 1970 at the Fillmore East.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMono bonus tracks\n\nStereo bonus tracks\n\nSources:\n\nThe Byrds\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n\n"}

Its name derives from the fact that it directly tests the presence of an antigen with the tagged antibody, unlike western blotting, which uses an indirect method of detection, where the primary antibody binds the target antigen, with a secondary antibody directed against the primary, and a tag attached to the secondary antibody.\n\nCommercial DFA testing kits are available, which contain fluorescently labelled antibodies, designed to specifically target unique antigens present in the bacteria or virus, but not present in mammals (Eukaryotes). This technique can be used to quickly determine if a subject has a specific viral or bacterial infection.\n\nIn the case of respiratory viruses, many of which have similar broad symptoms, detection can be carried out using nasal wash samples from the subject with the suspected infection. Although shedding cells in the respiratory tract can be obtained, it is often in low numbers, and so an alternative method can be adopted where compatible cell culture can be exposed to infected nasal wash samples, so if the virus is present it can be grown up to a larger quantity, which can then give a clearer positive or negative reading.\n\nAs with all types of fluorescence microscopy, the correct absorption wavelength needs to be determined in order to excite the fluorophore tag attached to the antibody, and detect the fluorescence given off, which indicates which cells are positive for the presence of the virus or bacteria being detected.\n\nDirect immunofluorescence can be used to detect deposits of immunoglobulins and complement proteins in biopsies of skin, kidney and other organs. Their presence is indicative of an autoimmune disease. When skin not exposed to the sun is tested, a positive direct IF (the so-called Lupus band test) is an evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus. Direct fluorescent antibody can also be used to detect parasitic infections, as was pioneered by Sadun, et al. (1960).\n\n"}

During its empire, reigned their most famous leader, Sumanguru Kante. \n\nSumanguru Kante was said to be a cruel, harsh leader of his kingdom according to old African historians. His harsh leadership style kept the empire in balance and led to organization within the nation states. There was also strong economic success under his rule. He is said to have used \"magic\" in order to scare his people and keep his kingdom together. \n\nThe Sosso Empire succeeded the Ghana empire after the downfall of the latter. Sumanguru captured the state called Kangaba during his reign, which later became the state of Mali. Sumanguru controlled his people under a harsh rule until he was eventually overthrown by African folklore hero, Sundiata. Sundiata was exiled from his home in the empire as a child. However, he traveled the surrounding area, gathered allies and troops to fight with him, and fought Sumanguru's empire at the battle of Krina in 1235. There, Sundiata was victorious and took over the Sosso empire, effectively ending the reign of the empire. \nThe modern Sosso people trace their history to a 12th- and 13th- century Kaniaga kingdom known as the \"Sosso.\" With the fall of the Ghana Empire, the Sosso expanded into a number of its former holdings, including its capital of Koumbi Saleh. Under King Soumaoro Kanté, the Sosso briefly conquered the Mandinka kingdoms of what is now Mali. These gains were lost at the Battle of Kirina (c. 1235) when Mandinka prince Sundiata Keita led a coalition of smaller states to soundly defeat the Sosso, thus beginning the Mali Empire. Sundiata marched on to the city of Sosso itself and destroyed it, marking the kingdom's end.\n\n"}

It can also be used as a method of quantifying the pathogenicity of food, blood or feces. DNA analysis have supported the combined use of both this technique and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Another laboratory separation tool is the affinity magnetic separation (AMS), which is more suitable for the isolation of prokaryotic cells.\n\nImmunomagnetic separation (IMS) is a method that deals with the isolation of cells, proteins, and nucleic acids within a cell culture or body fluid through the specific capture of biomolecules through the attachment of small-magnetized particles, beads, containing antibodies and lectins. These beads are coated to bind to targeted biomolecules, gently separated and goes through multiple cycles of washing to obtain targeted molecules bound to these super paramagnetic beads, which can differentiate based on strength of magnetic field and targeted molecules, are then eluted to collect supernatant and then are able to determine the concentration of specifically targeted biomolecules. The technique of immunomagnetic separation (IMS) obtains certain concentrations of specific molecules within targeted bacteria. \n\nA mixture of cell population will be put into a magnetic field where cells then are attached to super paramagnetic beads, specific example are Dynabeads (4.5-μm), will remain once excess substrate is removed binding to targeted antigen. Dynabeads consists of iron-containing cores, which is covered by a thin layer of a polymer shell allowing the absorption of biomolecules. The beads are coated with primary antibodies, specific-specific antibodies, lectins, enzymes, or streptavidin ; the linkage between magnetized beads coated materials are cleavable DNA linker cell separation from the beads when the culturing of cells is more desirable.\n\nMany of these beads have the same principles of separation; however, the presence and different strength s of magnetic fields requires certain sizes of beads, based on the ramifications of the separation of the cell population. The larger sized beads (>2μm) are the most commonly used range that was produced by Dynal (Dynal [UK] Ltd., Wirral, Mersyside, UK; Dynal, Inc., Lake Success, NY). Where as smaller beads (<100nm) are mostly used for MACS system that was produced by Miltenyi Biotech (Miltenyi Biotech Ltd., Bisley, Surrey, UK; Miltenyi Biotech Inc., Auburn, CA).\n\nImmunomagnetic separation (IMS) is used in a variety of scientific fields including molecular biology, microbiology, and immunology. (3) This technique of separation does not only consist of separation of cells within the blood, but can also be used for techniques of separation from primary tumors and in metastases research, through separation into component parts, creating a singular-cell delay, then allowing the suitable antibody to label the cell. In metastasis research this separation technique may become necessary to separate when given a cell population and wanting to isolate tumors cells in tumors, peripheral blood, and bone marrow. \n\nAntibodies coating paramagnetic beads will bind to antigens present on the surface of cells thus \"capturing\" the cells and facilitate the concentration of these bead-attached cells. The concentration process is created by a magnet placed on the side of the test tube bringing the beads to it.\nMACS systems (Magnetic Cell Separation system) :\n\nThrough the usage of smaller super paramagnetic beads (<100nm), which requires a stronger magnetic field to separate cells. Cells are labeled with primary antibodies and then MACS beads are coated with specific- specific antibodies. These labeled cell suspension is then put into a separation column in a strong magnetic field. The labeled cells are contained, magnetized, while in the magnetic field and the unlabeled cells are suspended, un-magnetized, to be collected. Once removed from magnetic field positive cells are eluted. These MACS beads are then incorporated by the cells allowing them to remain in the column because they do not intrude with the cell attachment to the culture surface to cell-cell interactions. A bead removal reagent is then applied to have an enzymatically release of the MACS beads allowing those cells to become relabeled with some other marker, which then is sorted. \n"}

It had the same modern all-metal construction, covered with corrugated duralumin sheet, as larger Junkers passenger planes. The first flight of the A50 took place on 13 February 1929. It was followed by further four prototypes, in order to test different engines.\n\nJunkers expected to produce 5,000 aircraft, but stopped after manufacturing only 69, of which only 50 were sold. The high prices probably inhibited sales. Apart from Germany, they were used in several other countries and some were used by airlines. The purchase price in 1930 in the United Kingdom was between £840 or £885. Starting from the A50ce variant, the wings could be folded for easier transport.\n\nThree German A50 took part in the Challenge international touring plane competition in July 1929, taking 11th place (A50be, pilot Waldemar Roeder) and 17th place.

{"id": "2206804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206804", "title": "Alexander Herrmann", "text": "Alexander Herrmann\n\nAlexander Herrmann (February 10, 1844 – December 17, 1896) was a French magician, better known as Herrmann the Great. He was married to Adelaide Herrmann, another magician known as the Queen of Magic.\n\nAlexander Herrmann was born in Paris, France, the youngest of sixteen children to Samuel Herrmann, a German Jew, and Anna Sarah (Meyer) Herrmann, of Breton descent (although she may in fact have been born in Hamburg, Germany). It was said that Samuel Herrmann was a physician who occasionally performed throughout Europe as a conjurer. \n\nAccording to the Herrmann family lore, Samuel Herrmann was a part-time magician and full-time physician. Samuel Herrmann was a favorite of the Sultan of Turkey, who sent for the magician often. The Sultan paid a princely sum for the entertainment. It has been said that he was receiving so much attention from the elite of Paris with his magic shows, that word spread to Napoleon himself, who wanted Samuel to perform for him. Napoleon reportedly gave Samuel a gold watch for his performance. Alexander Herrmann was carrying the gold watch on the day of his death. It was passed on to his widow. Eventually Samuel's practice as a physician demanded more of his time so he quit magic entirely.\n\nWith the birth of his eldest son, Compars, in 1816 in Hanover, Germany, he decided to settle down to continue his practice. Samuel Herrmann played small towns around from 1817 in Germany and moved his family to France. He played the institutes and lyceums of Paris and gave performances until 1855. He taught his skills to his oldest son Compars, also known as Carl. He played in colleges in Paris and Versailles. Samuel entertained the pupils of the grandes écoles near Versailles. With this performance, his son Carl was admitted to the school tuition-free. Samuel Herrmann continued even after his son Carl succeeded him as a magician. Samuel retired about 1860.\n\nAlexander's brother Compars Herrmann left medical school at an early age to pursue a career as a magician and served as a role model and inspiration for Alexander. When Compars (also known as Carl) returned to his parents' home in Paris in 1853, he was thrilled to find out that his eight-year-old brother Alexander was already showing an interest in magic. Without his family's consent, Carl 'kidnapped' his younger brother and took him to Saint Petersburg, Russia to teach him the art of magic. While there, he took his younger brother with him on a tour that started in Russia.\n\nAlexander remained with Carl until they arrived in Vienna. Their mother came there and insisted upon Alexander's return to Paris. They eventually reached a compromise; Alexander stayed with Carl until the tour was over. Alexander's duties consisted of being suspended in a horizontal position on top of a rod, performing as a blindfolded medium, and being lifted from an empty portfolio. During their European excursion, Carl was teaching Alexander advanced sleight of hand techniques, some of which he had learned from their father, others of which he had picked up on his own.\n\nAlexander was an eager and willing student. After touring places like Germany, Austria, Italy, and Portugal, the tour ended in Vienna. Carl settled in Vienna and, as promised, he sent Alexander home to their parents in Paris. Back in Paris, Alexander showed his father what he had learned from Carl. Samuel was so impressed with Alexander's skill that he decided to let him continue in magic. Alexander stayed in Paris until he was about 11 years old; then he returned to Vienna to meet up with Carl, who was to continue mentoring him. Carl had promised Samuel to teach Alexander things other than magic, and while in Vienna Alexander attended college. But it was sleight of hand that was to be his main interest. \n\nAlexander accompanied Carl on nearly every tour. At first he returned to his role as assistant. This time, though, he did not float on a horizontal pole. Carl discarded the equipment from his last tour when French magician Robert-Houdin claimed they were his tricks. Robert-Houdin had his trusted mechanic Le Grand arrested for making and selling duplicate illusions. It is not known whether Carl bought the illusions directly from LeGrand or from another source. What is known is that he discarded them in favor of tricks using pure sleight of hand.\n\nWhen Alexander's skills increased, he became a more integral part of Carl's show. By the time they arrived in the United States in 1860, Alexander was seventeen. Audiences noticed his adroitness; his dexterity soon rivaled that of his famous brother. Jealousy brewed on that tour, but never surfaced.\n\nThey appeared at the Academy of Music in Brooklyn during its inaugural season. The Academy of Music was known as a center for progressive and avant-garde performances. They generally presented operas, but when the two Herrmanns arrived, the music played second fiddle to the brothers' magic. The posters of the time mentioned that Herrmann's \"distinguishing feature is the entire absence of any apparatus, all effects being solely produced by extraordinary manual skill.\" They still performed Houdin's \"Second Sight\" as Alexander assisted Carl on stage. Carl introduced Alexander to the audience as his successor. Then Alexander performed a \"card scaling\" (card-throwing) act.\n\nCard-throwing finds its origins in Western stage magic. Western card-throwing techniques, as they are passed among performers today, are attributed to stage magicians in the late 19th century. The exact origins of \"flying card\" tricks are unknown, but Alexander is usually credited with first including card throwing in a major act. Alexander become so skilled that he could place a card in the lap of any spectator that raised their hand. He could also bounce cards off of the rear wall of the largest theatres. He developed a technique that is still copied today which allowed him to be able to scale the cards all the way to the back of the theater. This, of course, made a big impact on the people in the cheaper seats.\n\nFive weeks of full houses brought Carl receipts totaling $35,000 (about $700,000 in today's dollars). When the American Civil War broke out, the Herrmanns left the United States for Central and South America.\n\nA few years later, they parted company. Alexander appeared on his own until he met up with Carl in Vienna in 1867. They formed their second co-partnership and returned to the U.S. to resume their tour there. According to Walter B. Gibson's book \"The Magic Masters\", they \"implanted the name Herrmann quite firmly there.\" The Herrmann name eventually became synonymous with magic. Eventually the two magic brothers would go their separate ways.\n\nWith the departure of Carl, Alexander began his independent career in 1862. Carl returned to play to the capitals of Europe. Alexander brought his own show to London in 1871 and began a three-year stretch at Egyptian Hall, which he called his \"one thousand and one nights\". Egyptian Hall was one of the first buildings in England to be influenced by the Egyptian style, inspired by Europe's new interest in the various temples on the Nile, the Pyramids and the Sphinx. By the end of the 19th century, the Hall was also associated with magic and spiritualism, as a number of performers and lecturers had hired it for shows. So when Alexander began his run there, it was already the hallmark of a professional magician's career.\n\nAs he got older, he came to resemble his brother Carl. Carl wore an imperial beard and handlebar moustache, and his hair was thinning. Alexander had a full set of curly hair, a thick goatee and a moustache with upturned ends. Even though they resembled each other, Alexander developed his own distinct, magnetic personality. Carl's humor was sly and he presented his magic in a mysterious manner; he was from the old school of magic. Alexander's performance style, on the other hand, was to interweave comedy with his magic. He was a humorist who aimed to make his performances a joyous occasion.\n\nHerrmann's philosophy about performing magic was that \"the magician depends for the success of his art upon the credulity of the people. Whatever mystifies, excites curiosity; whatever in turn baffles this curiosity, works the marvelous.\"\n\nDespite his performances' humorous elements, Alexander still mystified his audiences. His intense eyes, imposing mustache and goatee gave him a satanic appearance; in person he looked like a magician. According to H. J. Burlingame, Alexander Herrmann's personality presented \"an atmosphere of mystery about the magician.\" Burlingame also noted that Herrmann was one of the kindest and gentlest of men.\n\nRumors emerged that Carl was Alexander's uncle, or that they were not related. A lawsuit claimed that Alexander's real name was Nieman. It went on to say that Carl adopted young Nieman and used him as an assistant so he could groom him to become his successor. The suit claimed that Nieman had adopted the name Herrmann. In 1895, Alexander printed a statement to a San Francisco newspaper that contradicted everything in the lawsuit. He told the newspaper that he had been born in France on February 11, 1843, of German parentage. (His date of birth given here contradicts records that show that he was born February 10, 1844, according to Herrmann expert James Hamilton). He stated that his father was a physician in Germany and had moved to Paris before Alexander was born. Nevertheless, the rumors persisted even after his death; Alexander's widow had to disprove them many times.\n\nCarl retired during Alexander's three-year stint at Egyptian Hall. While in America, Alexander had learned the value of making the press; he used that ability during his run in London. While strolling down Regent Street with a friend, he gathered a crowd. He stepped up to two gentlemen and picked a handkerchief from one. He did this clumsily to get the attention of two policemen that were behind him. As the two bobbies came towards him, Alexander deftly poached the watch of the second gentleman.\n\nAlexander's friend offered to vouch for him. As he was telling the virtues of his friend, the second man discovered that his watch was missing. He insisted that Herrmann took it. Alexander professed his innocence and asked the policemen to search him. They did not find the stolen items. Herrmann suggested that the two policemen should search themselves. The handkerchief was found on one of the cops, the missing pocket watch was on the other. Then one of the policemen noticed his badge missing. They searched one of the gentlemen and found the missing badge. Herrmann smiled and said, \"It seems that I am the only honest person here.\"\n\nHe tried in vain to explain to the police that the entire thing was just a magician's joke. \"We will not be deceived in that way,\" the second cop said. So they hauled him off to the police station. There he was recognized and set free. The London papers got hold of the story and made it a sensation. The entire town was laughing at the practical joke Herrmann had played on London's finest.\n\nHerrmann had an outgoing personality and had no problem making friends. Not only did men find him sociable, but ladies took fancy to him. One in particular was a 22-year-old dancer from London by the name of Adelaide Scarcez. Most of his acquaintances were from the theatrical world.\n\nAlexander's record-breaking run would soon end. He was set to tour Europe after his triumph at Egyptian Hall. Then he returned to the United States and Canada and made several tours. Meanwhile, the financial panic of 1873 wiped out his brother Carl. On May 9, the Vienna Stock Exchange (Wiener Börse) crashed. They no longer were able to bankroll the corrupt mismanagement of the Deutsche Bank. A series of Viennese bank failures resulted. This caused a deflation of the money available for business lending. (See Panic of 1873.)\n\nCarl needed money and the only way to pay his debts was to return to performing.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1874, Alexander returned to America. On the boat, he saw the young dancer Mademoiselle Scarcez that he had met in London. The titian-haired, bilingual Adelaide had been planning to marry an American actor. Before the ship docked, she changed her mind.\nIn Manhattan on March 27, 1875, the Mayor of New York performed the ceremony marrying Alexander and Adelaide. Herrmann was known to do spontaneous tricks. Even on his wedding day he could not resist; he produced a roll of bills from the mayor's beard.\n\nSometimes his gags backfired on him. He was once having dinner with newspaper journalist and humorist Bill Nye (aka Edgar Wilson Nye). Herrmann found a large diamond in the lettuce of Nye's salad. Nye turned the tables on the great magician. He picked up the diamond and handed it to a passing waitress—\"as a little present,\" Nye said. Herrmann had trouble getting his diamond back from the waitress. The girl refused to give it up. The proprietor of the restaurant had to apply pressure on her.\n\nIn New York, he wanted to purchase a home, but only a citizen of America could buy a home. So he became a naturalized citizen in July 1876 in Boston. Later, he bought a beautiful, dark red mansion in Whitestone, Queens in New York. An eight-foot-high, spiked wire fence enclosed the property. A herd of cattle and several goats grazing in the pasture could be seen along the winding, tree-lined road.\nWhen friends would visit from Europe, he would pick them up in his yacht, \"Fra Diavolo\", which he moored in Long Island Sound. He also had his private rail car waiting at the Whitestone Depot, along with two baggage cars that carried his equipment. The private car cost him $40,000 (about $800,000 in today's figures).\n\nAs Alexander's brother Carl got older, he reduced the size of his show. Alexander increased the size of his. The following is a description of a typical Herrmann show as seen through the eyes of a spectator.\n\nAfter much fanfare from the orchestra, Herrmann entered. He was decked out in black velvet evening clothes with britches. He wore the typical top hat of the day and white gloves. The audience applauded; he bowed and smiled.\n\nHe took off his gloves and made them vanish between his hands. Herrmann presented two metal cones and a beautifully decorated brass vase. He opened the lid on the vase and showed a bag of rice. All items were examined by spectators.\n\nUpon return of the items, Herrmann poured the rice into the vase and placed the lid on it. He went into the audience, walked over to a bearded gentleman and borrowed his hat. He reached over to the gentleman's beard and produced an orange from it—\"Thank you. Just what I needed for this trick\"—eliciting a chuckle from the audience. He returned to the stage and placed the hat on a chair and the orange on one of the tables.\n\nHerrmann asked the audience which cone they would like, \"The right one or the left?\" He took the selected cone and placed it upon the hat. \"I will cause the rice and orange to switch places\".\n\nAfter much by-play where he pretended to sneak the orange away from the cone, he decided not to use the cone at all. He left the cone on the empty hat and placed the orange on the table. After making a magical pass, he lifted up the cone and a pile of rice appeared on the crown of the hat. He picked up the orange and made it disappear in his hands. Then he lifted up the vase that contained the rice and showed the missing orange.\n\nFrom there, he would casually show his hands to be empty and produce a fan of cards from behind his knee. With the produced cards, he would go into a series of sleight of hand tricks. He concluded the card act with three people from the audience selecting cards. He placed the pack into a goblet. From the goblet, the selected cards would rise one by one. He would take the pack out of the goblet and toss them, and they would melt in mid-air.\n\nHe'd pretend that he was done with cards, but his empty hands were soon filled with them. He'd take each one and scale them into the audience. Herrmann would ask an audience member to call out for one and he'd accurately toss it to him, sometimes as far as the topmost row in the gallery.\n\nHerrmann then picked up the silk top hat that he had borrowed from an audience member. One by one, he would produce a number of silver dollars from the air. After the shining coin hit the glare of the spotlight, he would toss it into the hat with a definite clink sound. He would produce a large number of dollars until the hat was full. Herrmann poured the coins into a silver tray and showed it to the audience. From there, the coins were dumped into a paper bag. He'd wrap it up and toss it to the owner of the hat. The silver dollars had changed into a box of candy.\n\nA piece of paper was left over from the package. Herrmann picked this up and rolled it into a ball. Then he proceeded to knock it through his knee. In an instant he tossed the ball of paper into the air, where it vanished.\n\nHerrmann picked up the hat and discovered many things inside—enough to fill a trunk. He thanked the owner of the hat as he returned it. As he did, he found a white rabbit inside of it. Herrmann stroked the rabbit. He pulled it apart and had two rabbits, one in each hand. He put the rabbits on the table. \"If you notice,\" he said in his Parisian accent, \"the rabbits are the same size, no?\" He scooped them from the table and they melted into one.\n\n\"Now, you notice that the rabbit, she is much fatter\". He picked up a pistol from the table. He tossed the rabbit into the air and shot at it. The rabbit was gone. He quickly went down to the runway into the audience. He pulled the vanished rabbit from the coattails of a spectator.\n\nAs he walked back to the stage, the curtain closed behind him. He stood in front of the curtain and cradled the rabbit like a baby. He proceeded to talk to the rabbit. Apparently the rabbit did not understand broken French because the rabbit turned its head toward Herrmann and cocked up one ear. This caused the audience to laugh and applaud.\n\nThe orchestra picked up the pace of the music and Herrmann exited. Madame Herrmann entered, performing a fire dance. Alexander Herrmann caught his breath and the rest of the show continued.\nTo achieve most of his tricks in the first act, Herrmann would rely on what is referred to in magic as \"body loads\", one of the seven principles of sleight of hand. Herrmann carried his loads on his body and inside his coat, placing them where he needed them.\n\nOne summer evening, Herrmann was sitting backstage in his dressing room after packing his jacket. He had draped the tailcoat over his chair. He was talking to the theatre manager, who also had his evening jacket off. When the first bell rang for the beginning of the show to start, the manager got up, put on his coat, and left.\n\nHerrmann put on his coat and gloves as he walked towards the stage. The music played his march and he entered stage right.\n\nHe took his bow and went into his opening act. He took off his gloves in preparation to make them disappear when he realized that something was wrong: he wasn't wearing his coat. Without his coat, he could not go on with the first act. Instead of panicking, he set his gloves aside and picked up a pack of cards that was on the table.\n\nHe did some elegant card flourishes with them. As he was closing with some fancy cuts, he was wondering about his coat. Suddenly he had the answer. The theatre manager was also wearing a full dress suit. He must have taken Herrmann's coat. He gave the deck a final flourish. He snapped his fingers to the wings. One of his assistants came on stage. Herrmann was flinging cards out to the audience. He leaned over to the assistant and whispered, \"Find the manager. He's wearing my coat.\" He flung a few cards until half of the pack was left. He added, \"And bring me more cards.\" The assistant left.\n\nHerrmann took the next card and gripped it between the first and second finger of his left hand. Then he flicked his wrist, sailing the card into the audience. He then scaled two or three more cards in quick succession into the audience. His assistant came back with a few more cards. He told Herrmann that he had sent someone to look for the manager. Herrmann took the cards and scaled those. He told his assistant to bring on more cards.\n\nThe audience was waving for them. So he flung them with great speed one after another. He flung a few at the balcony into the hands of a waiting spectator. The audience was getting excited over his remarkable aim. More cards were brought on. News was relayed to him that they were still trying to find the manager. Herrmann was scaling cards to the farthest reaches of the gallery with even more accuracy. The audience went wild.\n\nHe was down to a few cards. He was exhausted and didn't know what else to do to stall. He looked over at the wings and saw the surprised manager. Herrmann scaled his last card and bowed. The applause was deafening.\n\nHe went offstage and quickly removed the manager's jacket. Then he carefully pulled off his own from the startled manager. Herrmann checked the contents. Everything was still in its place. He carefully put on his coat and smoothed it up. He strode on stage as before. He bowed as the applause crescendoed again. He then went into his original routine.\n\nIn 1883, after solidifying his name in the United States, Herrmann embarked on another world tour. His first stop was South America. Emperor Don Pedro II of Brazil attended nineteen performances in Rio de Janeiro. The emperor was so fascinated with Herrmann's magic that he presented him with the Cross of Brazil.\n\nAfter touring the rest of South America, Herrmann headed to Russia. His tour led him all the way to Siberia. In St. Petersburg, he received a grand reception. He was invited to a banquet for the Spanish minister, attended by various distinguished members of Russian society. They drank to his health: \"From this moment forth, you will be known as Herrmann the Great.\"\n\nThe newly crowned Herrmann the Great gave a command performance for Czar Alexander III of Russia.\nThe czar was impressed by Herrmann's delicate touch. He picked up a deck of cards and walked over to the wizard. He firmly grabbed the deck and tore it in half. He wanted to test Herrmann's mettle. He handed the torn deck to the magician to see if he could outmatch the czar's iron grip. Herrmann was always cool under fire. He only hesitated a moment as he proceeded with the challenge presented to him. He placed one half on top of the other and squared them neatly. Then he proceeded to tear both together. Czar Alexander was most impressed. He gave Herrmann a watch with a chain made of heavy twisted strands of gold.\n\nAlexander tells an interesting tale of an incident that took place after the performance. He was playing billiards at the saloon with the attaché of the court when he noticed the Czar was also playing there. Herrmann shot the ball with all of his strength against a plate-glass mirror that extended from the floor to the ceiling. It shattered into fifty pieces. Every person in the room was horrified, none more than Herrmann.\n\nThe Czar brushed off Herrmann's apology and considered the destruction of the mirror trivial. He ordered the game to proceed. With the Czar's permission, Herrmann examined the mirror to estimate the damage done. He was hoping to have it repaired.\n\nThe Czar teased him, saying if he was such a good wizard why didn't he make the mirror whole? That was the very cue Herrmann was hoping for. He hesitated for an instant, then ordered the mirror to be covered with a cloth concealing it from view. After about ten minutes, he whisked away the cloth and the mirror was completely restored and without a flaw.\n\nHerrmann later told \"The North American Review\" that he would leave it to the reader's imagination how it was done.\n\nFrom Russia, Herrmann returned to the place of his birth, France. At the Eden Theatre in Paris, his performance was witnessed by the Prince and Princess of Wales (later to become King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra of England, aka Alexandra of Denmark). \nAlexander met his brother Carl again in 1885 in Paris. Carl was still miffed at Alexander from his triumph at Egyptian Hall. Carl was planning on retiring again and was grooming their nephew Leon to be his successor. However, he did not intend to retire until he regained his fortune. So an agreement was made between the two brothers to split the world. Compars was to return to Europe and Alexander to the United States.\nAlexander left Paris to go back to America, where he became an established institution. Two years later, while in New York, Alexander was shocked to hear the news of the death of his brother Carl, who died on July 8, 1887, in Karlsbad in Germany. Even with the rivalry between them, Alexander could not help but feel that he owed everything to him. \"We've always had a warm and brotherly feeling towards each other,\" he told a newspaper.\n\nSince Alexander was widely known in the States, when news of the death of Professor Herrmann hit the papers, many thought it was Alexander that had died. He was mourned in the papers.\n\nCarl did regain his fortune before he died. Leon took his place and was doing well. Alexander was content to let Leon take over Europe.\n\nThroughout the 1870s and 1880s, Alexander and his wife Adelaide Herrmann performed together in elaborate stage shows. The great American impresario Michael B. Leavitt handled Herrmann's American and Mexican contracts. Leavitt always paid all transportation costs as well as advertising, salaries, and other expenses. \"Whenever I open a new theatre, \" Leavitt once said, \"I want to insure of large crowds, I will have Herrmann the Great play the date.\" He was always a drawing card wherever he played, receiving fifty percent of the gross receipt and earning $75,000 a year (about $3 million in today's figures).\n\nHe often squandered his money and would ask Leavitt to advance him $5,000 or more. Leavitt never refused his star. He considered it a safe investment. \"The name Herrmann the Great on any marquee was a sure sign of a successful run.\"\n\nAlexander and Adelaide lugged their show by railcar and kept their travels to the U.S. territories. They presented a full evening program, adapting such tricks as Robert Houdin's Ethereal suspension routine, otherwise known as aerial suspension, in an illusion called \"Trilby\". A board would be set on top of two chairs, and Madame Herrmann would be placed on top of the board. Both the board and Madame Herrmann would rise into the air. The two chairs would be removed. After a hoop was passed over, Madame Herrmann would descend back to the two chairs.\n\nThe Herrmanns presented this and many other fine illusions of the time. Their only rival was Harry Kellar.\n\nDuring the Golden Age of Magic, America only allowed one King of Magic at a time. Robert Heller was the first to wear the mantle. After his death, Harry Kellar tried to follow him, but because of the similarities between their names, it was wrongly assumed that he had adjusted his name to take advantage of the dead magician's fame. Even though he tried to prove that his original name was \"Keller\" with an \"e\" and changed years ago so not to be confused with his friend Heller, the public was still cold to him.\n\nSo Kellar toured the world instead, only making occasional trips to his home country. When he did, he found the new King of Magic was Herrmann the Great. He tried to dethrone the reigning monarch, but the America people loved Alexander and his wit.\n\nHerrmann knew Kellar wasn't serious competition, but he was condescending toward him nonetheless. He was judgmental of Kellar's lack of sleight of hand skills and his preference for using mechanical methods. Even on such favorites as the \"Miser's Dream\", Kellar chose to use a secret device he had created.\n\nKellar's misdirection was excellent in tricks like the \"Flower Growth\". Two flower pots were covered by a cone and a full bouquet of flowers were produced by Kellar as if they had grown magically. No false moves were ever detected by the audience. Herrmann too was a master at misdirection, and as a pure entertainer, he had no equal. \n\nLeavitt handled both magicians. There was never any problem until 1888 when Kellar learned of Herrmann's proposed tour of Mexico. Kellar asked Leavitt to cancel his American tour so he could play the Mexican tour before Herrmann's arrival date. At first Leavitt objected, but Kellar had a strong personality and would not take no for an answer. Leavitt regretfully conceded. However, instead of letting Kellar win, he used Herrmann as a spoiler.\n\nWhen Herrmann returned to the United States, he presented his expenses to Leavitt as usual. This time he refused to pay them. He claimed that much of the expense for transportation costs was for sending antique furniture and other curios back to Herrmann's home in Long Island. A litigation ensued which strained their relations.\n\nWhenever Herrmann or Kellar would play a town, they would hang paper banners heralding their arrival. Whoever got there first won that battle. So they started a succession of paper wars. Herrmann would put up his posters. Then Kellar's people would follow along and put up Kellar's posters. Herrmann's people would follow suit and cover Kellar's, making a third layer. This would continue until the day of the show; the last poster standing was the victor.\n\nAfter years of this bickering, they decided to hold a ceasefire. They felt the country was big enough to have two Kings of Magic. Even with this truce, the public still favored Alexander. \n\nOne of the most dangerous magic tricks is the bullet catch. The bullet catch is a trick in which a magician has a spectator mark a bullet and load it into a gun. Then the spectator fires directly at the magician, who appears to catch the bullet—often in his mouth, sometimes in his hand. In their patter, magicians often refer to the legend of 12 magicians that have died doing the trick. (\"Will I be number 13?\") Even though most things magicians utter is hyperbole, there is real danger associated with the bullet catch.\n\nA version of the act was designed by Herrmann the Great with the help of his assistant, Billy Robinson. (Years later, Billy, as Chung Ling Soo, would be killed with the same style gun.)\n\nOld fashioned muzzle-loaders were used for the act. The so-called bullet was actually a lead ball rammed into the gun together with a small charge of gunpowder. When the firing mechanism was activated, the gunpowder exploded and caused the lead ball to project forward down the barrel like a miniature cannon shot. In truth, most versions of the trick had either a fake bullet inserted into the gun, or had the ball secretly removed immediately before discharge. What came out the gun's muzzle was just a flash of fire, giving the illusion of an exiting projectile.\n\nHerrmann the Great performed his own version of the bullet catch. The bullet was still marked, but the danger of the trick was avoided. The gunpowder never came near the firing mechanism, with the result that the bullet never left the gun. The trick was safe—or so Herrmann thought; he would never live long enough to see his one-time assistant die from it.\n\nHowever, he did make the most of the trick. Not a normal part of his act, the trick would be presented on special occasions. Herrmann announced in May 1896 that he would attempt the bullet catch for the seventh time on the stage of the Olympia Theatre as part of a fundraiser for the Sick Babies Fund.\n\nA female reporter was dispatched to interview Madame Herrmann. She went to the Herrmann Manor at Whitestone Landing for the interview. As she walked in she was greeted with a voice that said, \"What do you want?\" She turned around and saw a black bird sitting on a perch. Just then an animated skeleton sprung out at her. She shrieked, which brought a maid from down the hall. She found the Herrmanns waiting for her.\n\nMadame Herrmann said, \"I lock myself into my dressing room whenever Alexander faces a firing squad\".\n\n\"Nonsense\", Herrmann the Great said: \"I have already caught bullets successfully six times. Seven, you know, is a lucky number\". He mentioned that he had applied for a life insurance plan with Connecticut Indemnity Association, but that the plan would not be in effect for the trick. Apparently he had not mentioned the bullet-catching stunt when he applied for it.\nOn the day of the performance, Herrmann looked somber. He wore a white shirt with frills on the sleeves. He had five muzzle loaders marked and loaded. They aimed their rifles at him. Madame Herrmann was nowhere to be seen. Herrmann held a china plate in front of him like a target. When he gave the orders, the gun was fired and he caught the bullets on the plate. Calmly he handed the bullets out for examination; they appeared to be the very same bullets.\n\nIn 1885 Herrmann returned to America, receiving the best terms given to any star on the road. He lost a lot of money to outside investments. For the upcoming season, he estimated he would make $85,000 to $95,000 profit (about $2 million in today's money).\n\nHerrmann the Great was a generous person despite his Mephistophelean appearance. He was the first magician to perform at Sing Sing prison. He lost lots of money helping other actors who invested in bad theatrical venues. When the manager of the Chicago Opera House needed three thousand dollars, he met the debt by sending him a check.\n\nOn December 16, 1896, Herrmann was finishing a week engagement at the Lyceum in Rochester, New York. He invited an entire school to his matinee performance. That afternoon, the house was packed. Because the throng was so enthusiastic and gave him many ovations, Herrmann extended the length of the performance.\n\nBetween shows, an agent pleaded with him to meet the overdue hotel bills of a theatrical company that was stranded in Rochester. Herrmann was moved by this request. Then the agent asked to buy railway tickets for them. Herrmann paid for their train tickets to Manhattan and paid their expenses. He also invited them to his evening show before they left.\n\nAfter the show, he was the guest of honor at a banquet given by the Genesee Valley Club. The group from the party was to occupy his special train for Bradford, Pennsylvania, which was to leave early in the morning. The festivities lasted until after midnight. He performed for the group, doing card tricks and telling amusing stories about his adventures around the world. \"My nephew Leon, who is in Paris, will be my successor when I retire.\"\nThe next day, he located the train and waved goodbye to his friends who had ridden with him from his private carriage to the railroad station. One of them was a young drama critic of the Rochester newspaper. His name was John Northern Hilliard. (Hilliard later became America's foremost author on magic.) The trip would be three hours.\n\nWhile on board a train to the next performance, Herrmann suffered a heart attack. The train stopped in Ellicottville, New York. Alexander whispered to Adelaide, \"Make sure all in the company get back to New York.\" The local doctor arrived a few moments later, but it was too late. He failed to recover. On December 17, 1896, at the age of 52, Herrmann the Great was pronounced dead.\n\nThe obituary that announced his death was the most extensive ever for a magician. Herrmann's body was taken to New York for burial services, and thousands attended and tried unsuccessfully to get close to the coffin. Herrmann is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.\n\nAfter Herrmann died in 1896, his widow Adelaide continued performing her husband's illusions. On January 11, 1897, she was joined by Alexander's nephew, Leon Herrmann. The Herrmann name still drew crowds, but because of clashes of temperament, Leon and Adelaide parted company after three seasons and continued separate acts.\n\nLeon's show failed to draw audiences, and this decline led to Kellar taking over the mantle of the leading magician in America. Leon later trimmed his show to a short vaudeville act. While on a holiday trip to Paris, Leon died on May 16, 1909.\n\nIn contrast, Adelaide Herrmann continued to perform as a successful solo magician for the next 25 years, and became known as \"The Queen of Magic\". Notably, she continued to perform the dangerous bullet catch trick. Adelaide retired at the age of 75. She died in 1932, and is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery next to her husband.\n\n\n"}

Other symptoms may include anorexia, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain. Extra-intestinal sites include the lung, liver, and gall bladder, where it causes respiratory cryptosporidosis, hepatitis, and cholecystitis, respectively.\n\nInfection is caused by ingestion of sporulated oocysts transmitted by the faecal-oral route. In healthy human hosts, the median infective dose is 132 oocysts. The general \"C. parvum\" lifecycle is shared by other members of the genus. Invasion of the apical tip of ileal enterocytes by sporozoites and merozoites causes pathology seen in the disease.\n\nInfection is generally self-limiting in immunocompetent people. In immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS or those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, infection may not be self-limiting, leading to dehydration and, in severe cases, death.\n\n\"C. parvum\" oocysts are very difficult to detect; their small size means they are difficult to detect in fecal samples. A fecal ELISA could detect the presence of the parasite. A serological ELISA is unable to distinguish between past and present infections.\n\n\"C. parvum\" is considered to be the most important waterborne pathogen in developed countries. The protozoa also caused the largest waterborne-disease outbreak ever documented in the United States, making 403,000 people ill in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1993. It is resistant to all practical levels of chlorination, surviving for 24 hours at 1000 mg/L free chlorine. It is an obligate intracellular pathogen.\n\nThe most effective way to prevent the spread of \"C. parvum\" is to avoid contact with contaminated feces. Avoiding this contact, especially with young children, is important, as they are more likely to come into oral contact and have the parasite transferred into the body. Hygiene is the most effective way to combat this difficult-to-prevent parasite. Those visiting areas, such as petting zoos, where they might access affected animals should ensure good hygiene measures such as hand washing\n\nThe \"C. parvum\" oocysts are incredibly durable, which can cause extended problems when attempting to control the spread of the parasite. The oocyst stage can tolerate a vast number of environmental pressures. The oocyst can tolerate temperatures as low as −22 °C and for long periods of time, which means fecal contamination is possible even after going through deep freezing. The oocysts can also tolerate shifts in pH that are found in some water treatment processes, and careful attention to detail must be done to prevent the possibility of infection. The oocysts in fecal material are immediately infective and have the potential to find a new host if contamination occurs.\n\nThe genome of \"C. parvum\" (sequenced in 2004) is of relatively small size and simple organization of 9.1 Mb, which is composed of eight chromosomes ranging from 1.04 to 1.5 Mb. The genome is very compact, and is one of the few organisms without transposable elements. Unlike other apicomplexans, \"C. parvum\" has no genes in its plastids or mitochondria.\n\nTreatment of gastrointestinal infection in humans involves fluid rehydration, electrolyte replacement, and management of any pain. , nitazoxanide is the only drug approved for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent hosts. Paromomycin may alleviate some of the diarrhoeal symptoms and is registered for it in UK for non-ruminating calves (Parofor Crypto, Huvepharma). Continuing antiretroviral drugs for HIV infection to boost the immune system may also control infection.\n\n\"C. parvum\" is incapable of \"de novo\" lipid synthesis, making its lipid trafficking machinery an important potential therapeutic target. \"C. parvum\" possesses multiple oxysterol-binding proteins (OSBPs), and oxysterol related proteins (OSRPs). Only OSBPs are capable of lipid binding, while both contain Pleckstrin homology domains, which function in cell signalling pathways.\n\n\"C. parvum\" possesses numerous surface glycoproteins thought to play a role in pathogenesis. An immunodominant >900 kDa protein, known as GP900, localizes to the apical end of sporozoites and in micronemes of merozoites. Its high molecular mass is most likely due to heavy post-translational glycosylation. Indeed, the structure of GP900 is similar to that of a family of glycoproteins known as mucins. GP900 is thought to mediate attachment and invasion to host cells. GP900 may also play a role in \"C. parvum\"s resistance to proteolysis by the numerous proteases found in the mammalian gut.\n\n\"In vitro\", hyperimmune sera, as well as antibodies directed at specific epitopes on the GP900 protein, inhibit the invasion of \"C. parvum\" sporozoites into MDCK cell monolayers. Additionally, competitive inhibition using native GP900 or purified GP900 fragments reduces cell invasion.\n\nFurther experiments have confirmed the importance of the mucin-like glycosylations. Lectins directed at GP900 carbohydrate moieties (alpha-N-galactosamine) were able to block adhesion and prevent \"C. parvum\" invasion.\n\n\"C. parvum\" glycoproteins have the characteristics of attractive vaccine candidates. Many are immunodominant, and antibodies against select domains block invasion of host cells.\n"}

{"id": "2206833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206833", "title": "Some Fantastic Place", "text": "Some Fantastic Place\n\nSome Fantastic Place is the tenth studio album by the British new wave group Squeeze, released in 1993 by A&M Records. Their first album since the departure of original Squeeze drummer Gilson Lavis, it features Pete Thomas and the brief return of keyboardist/vocalist Paul Carrack, who had previously appeared on \"East Side Story\" (1981). \"Loving You Tonight\" became only the second Squeeze song cut in thirteen years to feature Carrack singing a lead part. Additionally, bassist Keith Wilkinson wrote and sang \"True Colours (The Storm)\", the first song on a Squeeze album not written by Glenn Tilbrook, Chris Difford, Jools Holland, or any combination of those three.\n\nThe album features a pop rock style and was produced by Squeeze and Peter Smith. Recorded in Tilbrook's recently built personal studios, the recording sessions involved a larger deal of debate concerning song structures, which the band said helped contribute towards the album's passionate sound. Unusually, Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford wrote songs together rather than apart, which they suggested helped revitalise their working relationship. The album was released to critical acclaim, and the title track remains Difford and Tilbrook's favourite Squeeze song. The album reached number 26 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\nA&M Records had dropped Squeeze following the commercial disappointment of \"Frank\" (1989), and they subsequently signed to Reprise Records for the release of \"Play\" (1991). However the album was another sales failure and the band, who were then dropped again and subsequently resigned to A&M for \"Some Fantastic Place\". Around this period, drummer Gilson Lavis, who had played on all of Squeeze's albums up until this point, left the band. Glenn Tilbrook reflected: \"He just got tired of being in the band, and it was time for him to move on. It's bound to be emotional when you've worked with somebody for that long, but I think it was the right decision for Gil to make, and it's not tempered with any bitterness.\" Lavis later disputed this, claiming he was fired from the band: \"I was kicked out after an American tour. I’d just separated from my wife and I was in a bit of a state. I’d been sober for seven years and I decided that having a drink would be a good idea. So on this tour I was a bit of a mess, and very depressed. When we got back there was a band meeting and I was told I wasn’t needed any more.\"\n\nSqueeze, at the time consisting of songwriters Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook and bassist Keith Wilkinson, originally intended to record \"Some Fantastic Place\" as a trio with the addition of programmed drum and keyboard instruments, but ultimately opted to add several members. When Difford and Tilbrook were performing an acoustic show, they noticed Paul Carrack, who had been with the band for less than a year in 1981 and had played keyboards on \"East Side Story\" while singing its hit single \"Tempted\", was nearby. They asked him to open live for them, thinking it would be unlikely, but nonetheless he agreed. When the band were rehearsing for \"Some Fantastic Place\", Difford suggested the band readmit Carrack into the band, which they put \"to the test\". Difford later said \"it's worked out marvellously.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the band line-up was completed by drummer Pete Thomas, previously of Elvis Costello's backing band The Attractions. Tilbrook said that Thomas gave the album a \"very different rhythmical approach\" to other Squeeze albums, explaining: \"Pete is a song-orientated drummer. He listens to the song and decides what's needed from him -- which is great for us, as we're also song-orientated.\"\n\n\"Some Fantastic Place\" marked another change for the band, in that Difford and Tilbrook, who typically write separately, went for a relatively simplistic approach, sitting down together and writing the majority of the album as a team. The duo credited this approach with revitalising their working relationship, bringing about a \"big jump\" in their creativity level. Tilbrook commented: \"It was like discovering a new partnership, because suddenly we were able to bounce ideas back and forth off each other.\"\n\nTilbrook had recently built a recording studio near his London home, so the band visited the studio everyday, both rehearsing and recording the record there. The studio was allegedly located in Blackheath above a welder's shop. The writing took approximately two months, and \"for two or three of the songs, [the band] sat in the same room with each other.\" Difford explained: \"Glenn created an environment, and to leave our homes and go and work together was something new. It was good to sit in the same room and be inventive. It makes things simpler; you don't have to wait for the results. It's quite inspirational.\" The studio was relatively small, which Tilbrook felt worked for the band just as he hoped it would, noting the \"really good vibe.\"\n\nCompared to previous albums, more open debate concerning the song arrangements occurred between members than on any previous Squeeze album, which Difford called \"a lot of to-ing and fro-ing\" and believed helped make \"Some Fantastic Place\" one of the band's better albums. Each band member had strong ideas on how they wanted the songs to be, and they stood on firm ground when they believed they were right. Difford enjoyed this experience \"because it showed that people really cared.\"\n\n\"Some Fantastic Place\" maintains a mix of \"emotionally complex storytelling and uplifting songcraft,\" in the words of Harold Dumuir of \"Pulse\". Difford felt \"Some Fantastic Place\" would be ideal for reintroducing the band into the public consciousness: \"In some respects, we really need to reeducate people about Squeeze, and remind them that we're here, and I think that this is a good album to do that with, because it contains all the best elements of what Squeeze has always been. It's got a good balance of optimism and pessimism, light and dark, up and down, yin and yang.\" Most songs are sung by Tilbrook, with Difford sticking to background harmonies. Musically, the album is warm, simplistic and lively, featuring the band's signature pop rock sound, as exemplified throughout the record with songs as varied as the melodic power pop of \"Third Rail\" and blue-eyed soul of \"Loving You Tonight\".\n\nFailed and failing relationships are a recurring theme on the album. Mat Snow of \"Q\" noted the bittersweet kitchen sink style of the lyrics, while Gary Leboff of \"Vox\" felt the album was less offbeat than previous Squeeze albums, with fewer East End characters in the band's lyrics than usual, though nonetheless maintaining a quirkiness, citing \"Cold Shoulder\" and \"Jolly Comes Home\", which he described as \"a 'Labelled with Love'-esque reflection on suburban mundanity.\" \"Trouser Press\" noted \"sharply noted details\" in the lyrics: \"[T]he initialed 45s left behind in 'Images of Loving,' an attempted rapprochement in 'It's Over,' a cat flap in the kitchen door that provides a dog's-eye view in 'Cold Shoulder'.\"\n\nThe album's title track, with its balanced themes of loss and acceptance, is a tribute to Maxine Barker, a longtime friend of the band who had been responsible for first introducing Tilbrook and Difford in the early 1970s and who succumbed to leukemia in 1992. The song was described by Tilbrook as \"one of those songs that wrote itself; it was done straight off in about 10 minutes.\" The singer incorporated a guitar solo in the song which he wrote when he and Difford met in 1973. \"Jolly Come Home\" – a quietly intense song – and \"Cold Shoulder\", which was penned by Difford during a 65-mile car drive, inject mordant humour into themes of domestic dysfunction. Music critic Gary Leboff said of the latter song: \"'Cold Shoulder' does everything right: an opening image of our love-battered and locked-out hero peering through the cat-flap at the missus's feet, a wistful tune counterpointed by a sardonic guitar line, every detail poignant in its starkness. In this mode, Squeeze kill you softly every time.\"\n\nAmong other melodic songs that document stalled romances, \"Third Rail\" uses an electric railway for an emotional metaphor, while \"Everything in the World\" was influenced by Motown music and uses a conspicuous beat which drowns out the vocals and melody, drawing comparison to the Vandellas. Carrack's \"Loving You Tonight\" is in a mellow soul style, while Wilkinson makes his vocal and songwriting debut with \"True Colours (The Storm)\", a tropical and calypso flavoured song. He had brought several songs to Squeeze throughout his tenure with the band and \"we'd figured he'd waited in line long enough,\" according to Tilbrook. \"Pinocchio\" is an ambitious song with forthright lyrics, described by one critic as \"a tale of Jack the Laddish deceit.\"\n\n\"Third Rail\" was released as a single ahead of the album on 12 July 1993, reaching number 39 in the UK Singles Chart, while \"Everything in the World\" was released in the United States only, reaching number 9 on the American US Modern Rock charts. A&M Records released \"Some Fantastic Place\" on 14 September 1993, where it was a modest hit, reaching number 26 on the UK Albums Chart. The subsequent singles from the album were less successful; \"Some Fantastic Place\", issued in August 1993, reached number 73, while October's \"Loving You Tonight\" single did not chart. The final single, February 1994's \"It's Over\", reached number 89. Squeeze went on a nationwide tour of Britain in promotion of the album, where both older and new songs were well received by audiences. As of 1996, \"Some Fantastic Place\" had sold 67,800 copies.\n\n\"Some Fantastic Place\" was released to positive reviews from music critics. Mat Snow of \"Q\" rated the album four stars out of five and called it \"another fine Squeeze album [...] with the usual complement of perfectly realised songs and bittersweet kitchen sinkery.\" Gary Leboff of \"Vox\" called the album \"another collection stuffed with melodic treats and lyrical wit, for consumption by an audience significantly smaller than they deserve.\" He highlighted the last two songs as the best on the album. Despite a score of two and a half stars out of five, Chris Woodstra of AllMusic was favourable, saying \"the classic sound is still there\" and concluding that it was \"[a]nother in a series of commercial sleepers, but definitely worth a listen.\"\n\nMark Caro of the \"Chicago Tribune\" hailed the album for \"[providing] room and reason to dig\" compared to the band's previous few albums, writing that Tilborok and Difford \"have brightened up musically while maintaining the crown as pop-rock's most tuneful and trenchant observers of romantic breakdowns.\" He described Difford's protagonists as \"still getting into awkward positions\" while Tilbrook \"provides snaky pop\", whereas \"Jolly Comes Home\" is \"as incisive and beautiful a ballad as the band has recorded.\" \"Phoenix New Times\" reflected that the album was \"an adult, yet considerably bouncier, work\" than prior Squeeze albums. \"Trouser Press\" criticised the writing, finding too many songs to talk of romantic break-ups, but nonetheless felt the album was \"lively and unpretentious.\"\n\nIn \"The Rough Guide to Rock\", Nick Dale highlights it as one of Squeeze's four most essential albums and their \"most successful release since \"Babylon and On\", and for good reason.\" He wrote the band showed \"no signs of flagging\" and noted the growing sophistication and sensitivity on the title track and \"Loving You Tonight,\" while also highlighting the title track, \"Cold Shoulder\" and \"Third Rail\" as the best songs on the album. Elton John bought twenty copies of the album for his numerous homes and cars. The album's title track remains one of the band's favourite Squeeze songs. After the release of the album, Carrack and Thomas left the band on amicable terms.\n\nAll songs written by Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook except as indicated.\n\nwith:\n\n"}

It was founded in the first half of the 14th century by Serbian king Stefan Dečanski.\n\nThe Visoki Dečani monastery is located by the Dečanska Bistrica river gorge at the foot of the Prokletije Mountains, in the region of Metohija. It is located about from the town of Dečan. The monastery is managed by the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Raška and Prizren. The monastery has been under the legal protection of Serbia since 1947 with a designation of \"Cultural Monument of Exceptional Importance\". The monastery is part of the World Heritage site named \"Medieval Monuments in Kosovo\".\n\nConstruction began during the reign of Serbian King Stefan Dečanski in 1327 and the original founding charter from 1330 has been preserved. Dečanski's son, Stefan Dušan, seized the Serbian throne in 1331 and had his father strangled to death in the Zvečan Fortress shortly afterwards. Dečanski was buried in the still incomplete Visoki Dečani monastery in 1331 and its construction was continued by Dušan. The monastery's main architect was the Franciscan friar Vito of Kotor. According to Branislav Pantelić, the monastery represents the last phase of the Western, Gothic, Byzantine-Romanuesque architecture and contains Byzantine paintings and numerous Romanseque sculptures, part of a \"Palaeologan renaissance\". \n\nConstruction of the monastery lasted for a total of 8 years, and ended in 1335. The wooden throne of the \"hegumen\" (monastery head) was finished at around this time, and the church interior was decorated. Dečanski's carved wooden sarcophagus was finished in 1340. Serbian princess and Bulgarian empress consort Ana-Neda (d. ca. 1350) was buried in the church.\n\nBulgarian writer Gregory Tsamblak, author of the \"Life of Stefan Dečanski\", was the \"hegumen\" (monastery head) at the beginning of the 15th century. The painter-monk Longin spent two decades in the monastery during the second half of the 16th century and created 15 icons with depictions of the Great Feasts and hermits, as well as his most celebrated work, the icon of Stefan Dečanski. In the late 17th century, the Ottomans plundered the monastery, but inflicted no serious damage. In 1819, archimandrite Zaharija Dečanac became Metropolitan of Raška and Prizren.\n\nDuring World War I, the monastery's treasures were plundered by the Austro-Hungarian Army, which occupied Serbia between 1915 and 1918. The monastery fell within the territory of the Italian-ruled Albanian Kingdom during World War II, and was targeted for destruction by the Albanian nationalist \"Balli Kombëtar\" and Italian fascist blackshirts in mid-1941. The Royal Italian Army responded by sending a group of soldiers to help protect the monastery from attack. \nThe monastic treasure was exhibited in the rebuilt medieval refectory in 1987. The monastery's monks sheltered refugees of all ethnicities during the Kosovo War, which lasted from March 1998 to June 1999. On 7 May 1998, the corpses of two elderly Albanians were found from the monastery. They were reportedly killed by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) for allegedly collaborating with Serbian forces. The KLA staged an attack not far from the monastery on 8 May, killing one person and wounding four others. That evening, Dečani's 300 remaining Serbs came to the monastery to seek shelter.\n\nAlbanian civilians seeking refuge in the monastery returned to their homes following the withdrawal of Serbian military from Kosovo in June 1999. An Italian unit of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) was subsequently assigned to guard the monastery, which was attacked on several occasions. Dozens of Romanis sought sanctuary in the monastery over the next several months, fearing retaliatory attacks by their Albanian neighbours, who accused them of collaborating with the Serbs and looting Albanian homes.\n\nDuring the violent unrest in Kosovo on 17 March 2004, KFOR defended the monastery from an Albanian mob trying to throw Molotov cocktails at it. Several Albanians were shot and wounded in the clash. On 2 July 2004, the monastery was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). UNESCO cited it as \"an irreplaceable treasure, a place where traditions of Romanesque architecture meet artistic patterns of the Byzantine world.\" The monastery, along with all other Serbian Medieval Monuments in Kosovo, was added to the UNESCO list of endangered World Heritage sites in 2006.\n\nSuspected Kosovo Albanian insurgents hurled hand grenades at the monastery on 30 March 2007, but caused little damage. In recent years, the situation around the monastery has stabilized and it has reopened to visitors. Serbian President Boris Tadić attended a service at the monastery in April 2009. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden visited the monastery the following month.\n\nThe church has five-nave naos, a three-part iconostasis, and a three-nave parvise. With the dome, it is 26 m high. Its outer walls are done in alternate layers of white and pink marble. The portals, windows, consoles, and capitals are richly decorated. Christ the Judge is shown surrounded by angels in the western part of the church. Its twenty major cycles of fresco murals represent the largest preserved gallery of Serbian medieval art, featuring over 1000 compositions and several thousand portraits.\n\nDečani Monastery is one of four World Heritage medieval monuments in Kosovo designated as a heritage site in danger. Since the arrival of KFOR peacekeepers in the region in 1999, attacks on the Monastery have increased. Since 1999 there have been five significant attacks and near miss attacks on the monastery:\n\n\nDečani Monastery is currently under 24/7 guard from KFOR. Of the four medieval monuments in Kosovo that are designated as a heritage site in danger, Dečani is the only one under direct guard from KFOR.\n\n\"Visoki Dečani\", three episodes of the documentary series \"Witnesses of Times\" produced by the broadcasting service RTB in 1989 was created by PhD Gordana Babic and Petar Savković, directed by Dragoslav Bokan, music was composed by Zoran Hristić.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2206839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206839", "title": "Diego Arria", "text": "Diego Arria\n\nDiego Enrique Arria Salicetti (born 8 October 1938 - Caracas, Venezuela), is a Venezuelan politician and diplomat who served as Venezuela's Permanent Representative to the United Nations (1991–1993) and President of the Security Council (March 1992).\n\nHe was governor of the Federal District of Caracas in the mid-1970s. Other positions have included Diplomatic Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and Visiting Scholar at Columbia University. Arria is a critic of former President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, and denounced him at the International Criminal Court at The Hague for crimes against humanity. Chávez died before the court could judge his case.\n\nArria was schooled partly in Caracas and partly at the Augusta Military Academy at Fort Defiance, Virginia. He obtained a degree in economics and political science from the University of Michigan. Arria worked for the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, D.C. until he returned to Venezuela in 1969, initially as Director of Tourism in Rafael Caldera's Ministry of Development, and later as president of the CONAHOTU (National Corporation of Hotels and Tourism), and president of Venezuelan Tourism Corporation.\n\nArria resigned as head of the Venezuela Tourism Corporation to create the political movement Causa Común (Common Cause) that later supported the presidential candidacy of Carlos Andrés Pérez (CAP). In 1973, Arria was elected member of the National Congress, representing the state of Miranda. Shortly after CAP was elected in March 1974, he appointed Arria Governor of the Federal District (Caracas), at a time when this was one of the most important presidential appointments. In September 1974, he went to Chile to negotiate with President Pinochet for the release of his friend Orlando Letelier, who later became a colleague at the Inter American Development Bank in D.C. Pinochet ordered the release of Letelier, who was told by the officer in charge that \"\"the arm of DINA is long; General Pinochet will not and does not tolerate activities against his government.\" \"This was a clear warning to Letelier that living in exile in Venezuela and United States would not guarantee his safety. In fact, not long after in 1976, Letelier was murdered in a car bomb attack in Washington D.C on Pinochet's order. Arria intervened again by bringing Letelier's body to Caracas for burial, where it remained until the end of Pinochet's rule. He subsequently moved from the governorship to become Minister of Information and Tourism in February 1977. He resigned on 17 March 1978 in order to stand as an independent candidate in the 1978 Venezuelan presidential election. As part of his campaign, he published two books: \"Primero La Gente\" (\"The People First\") and \"Dedicación a una Causa\" (\"Dedication to a Cause\").\n\nIn 2012, Arria stood as an independent candidate for the presidential nomination of the Coalition for Democratic Unity for the 2012 Venezuelan presidential election. Primary elections were held on 12 February 2012, with Henrique Capriles Radonski winning the nomination.\n\nArria was Venezuela's Permanent Representative to the United Nations from 1991 to 1993, and President of the Security Council (March 1992), during Venezuela's membership of the Security Council. Arria later became Special Advisor to Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the UN. \n\nAs UNSC president, he initiated the eponymous 'Arria formula' a very informal consultation process which affords members of the Security Council the opportunity to hear persons in a confidential, informal setting. These meetings are presided over by a member of the Council who acts as a facilitator for the discussion rather than the President of the Council. Arria has described this formula as a way of ensuring that members 'have to be honest'. He was chairman during the massacres at Srebrenica. After visiting the enclave, he warned of its impending doom and predicted that a massacre would take place, saying it was \"slow motion Genocide\" and describing the besieged enclave as \"a concentration camp policed by UNPROFOR\". According to the UN, \nDuring the March 1992 Council presidency of Venezuela, Ambassador Diego Arria was contacted by Fra Joko Zovko, a Croatian priest who was eager to convey an eyewitness account of the violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina to members of the Council. Not being able to find a formal way to hold a meeting, Arria decided to invite Council members to meet with Fra Joko in the UN delegates lounge. This experience gave Arria the idea of institutionalising this innovative informal meeting format which came to be known as the “Arria-formula”. With the concurrence of Council members, subsequent Arria meetings moved from the delegates lounge to a UN conference room in the basement and were supported by simultaneous interpretation. More recently, many Arria meetings have been held in large UN conference rooms such as, for example, the Trusteeship Council chamber.\nOne Arria formula meeting did get worldwide attention; it was hosted by the Russian UN delegation (the fourth Arria formula meeting they have held since the format was conceived) dealing with OPCW reporting on the Douma chemical attack, part of the recent Syrian Civil War, which was held at the UNSC on 20th of January 2020. Other Arria formula meetings have been held on Israeli settlements and religious persecution in China and Pakistan.\n\nOther positions have included Diplomatic Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and Visiting Scholar at Columbia University. He is a member of the Board of Directors of the Institute of the Americas and of Freedom Now, and of the Board of Advisors of Inter-American Dialogue. He has been a Director at The Columbus Group, and is currently the Chairman of the Advisory Board at Athelera LLC as well as a Member of the Board of Advisors at VMS Associates, LLC.\n\nIn November 2011, Arria filed charges for crimes against humanity against Chávez at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.\n\nOn 30 April 2010, Arria's ranch, \"La Carolina\" in Yaracuy State, was taken over by the Venezuelan government. Minister of Agriculture Elias Jaua \"declared that lawyers and historians working for the National Lands Institute (INTI) ha[d] not been able to find continuity of ownership deeds in the national register and therefore the lands are \"fallow\" and return to the State\". According to government officials, the ranch was unproductive and was a case of idle lands; according to Arria, the farm had 300 cattle and 90% of it was under some form of agricultural development. Becoming aware of the expropriation threat, Arria took photos of the farm and the cattle and posted them on the Internet, including the one used here. \"Correo del Orinoco\", a state-owned newspaper, reported its claims that Arria's declarations about expropriation and looting by the Ministry of Agriculture are \"subversive and tend to urge the homicide of Hugo Chávez.\" According to Arria, the expropriation was a reaction to Arria's participation in the Oslo Freedom Forum, where he stated that Chavez will have to face International Justice one day for his \"crimes\" against the Venezuelan people. He has since described the ranch's seizure as \"pillaging and ransacking.\"\n\nDiego Arria and several other opposition figures were the victims of an attempt by the Venezuelan government to accuse them of a fabricated plot. A top Venezuelan government official, Jorge Rodriguez, alleged that he had uncovered emails between the accused that proved their guilt, resulting in Venezuela's attorney general Luisa Ortega Díaz subpoenaing Arria as a witness, along with María Corina Machado, Pedro Burelli, and Ricardo Koesling, and a week later, on June 11, warrants were issued for their arrest. However, the defendants hired Kivu, a US-based cybersecurity company, with Kivu performing an analysis of the alleged emails covered in the Venezuelan government's report, stating that there was \"no evidence of the existence of any emails between Pedro Burelli's Google email accounts and the alleged recipients,\" that the alleged emails had \"many indications of user manipulation,\" and that \"Venezuelan officials used forged emails to accuse government adversaries of plotting to kill President Nicolas Maduro.\"\n"}

{"id": "2206845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206845", "title": "Cryptosporidium", "text": "Cryptosporidium\n\nCryptosporidium is a genus of apicomplexan parasitic alveolates that can cause a respiratory and gastrointestinal illness (cryptosporidiosis) that primarily involves watery diarrhea (intestinal cryptosporidiosis) with or without a persistent cough (respiratory cryptosporidiosis) in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient humans.\n\nTreatment of gastrointestinal infection in humans involves fluid rehydration, electrolyte replacement, and management of any pain. , nitazoxanide is the only drug approved for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent hosts. Supplemental zinc may improve symptoms, particularly in recurrent or persistent infections or in others at risk for zinc deficiency. \"Cryptosporidium\" oocysts are 4–6 μm in diameter and exhibit partial acid-fast staining. They must be differentiated from other partially acid-fast organisms including \"Cyclospora cayetanensis\".\n\n\"Cryptosporidium\" causes cryptosporidiosis, an infection that may present as a diarrhoeal with or without a persistent cough in immunocompetent hosts. Other apicomplexan pathogens include the malaria parasite \"Plasmodium\" and the toxoplasmosis parasite \"Toxoplasma\". Unlike \"Plasmodium\", which transmits via a mosquito vector, \"Cryptosporidium\" does not use an insect vector, and is capable of completing its lifecycle within a single host, resulting in cyst stages that are excreted in feces or through inhalation of coughed on fomites and are capable of transmission to a new host.\n\nA number of \"Cryptosporidium\" species infect mammals. In humans, the main causes of disease are \"C. parvum\" and \"C. hominis\" (previously \"C. parvum\" genotype 1). \"C. canis\", \"C. felis\", \"C. meleagridis\", and \"C. muris\" can also cause disease in humans.\n\nCryptosporidiosis is typically an acute, short-term infection, can be recurrent through reinfection in immunocompetent hosts, and become severe or life-threatening in immunocompromised individuals. In humans, it remains in the lower intestine and may remain for up to five weeks. The parasite is transmitted by environmentally hardy cysts (oocysts) that, once ingested, exist in the small intestine and result in an infection of intestinal epithelial tissue. Transmission by ingestion or inhalation of coughed on fomites is a second, less likely route of infection.\n\nThe genome of \"Cryptosporidium parvum\", sequenced in 2004, was found to be unusual amongst eukaryotes in that the mitochondria seem not to contain DNA. A closely related species, \"C. hominis\", also has its genome sequence available.\n\nCryptosporidium has three developmental stages: meronts, gamonts and oocysts.\nThe \"Cryptosporidium\" spore phase (oocyst) can survive for lengthy periods outside a host. It can also resist many common disinfectants, notably chlorine-based disinfectants.\n\nMany treatment plants that take raw water from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs for public drinking water production use conventional filtration technologies. Direct filtration, which is typically used to treat water with low particulate levels, includes coagulation and filtration but not sedimentation. Other common filtration processes including slow sand filters, diatomaceous earth filters, and membranes will remove 99% of \"Cryptosporidium\". Membranes and bag- and cartridge-filter products remove \"Cryptosporidium\" specifically.\n\n\"Cryptosporidium\" is highly resistant to chlorine disinfection; but with high enough concentrations and contact time, \"Cryptosporidium\" inactivation will occur with chlorine dioxide and ozone treatment. In general, the required levels of chlorine preclude the use of chlorine disinfection as a reliable method to control \"Cryptosporidium\" in drinking water. Ultraviolet light treatment at relatively low doses will inactivate \"Cryptosporidium\". Calgon Carbon-funded research originally discovered UV's efficacy in inactivating \"Cryptosporidium\".\n\nOne of the largest challenges in identifying outbreaks is the ability to verify the results in a laboratory. The oocytes may be seen by microscopic examination of a stool sample, but they may be confused with other objects or artifacts similar in appearance. Most cryptosporidia are 3–6 μm in size, although some reports have described larger cells.\n\nFor the end consumer of drinking water believed to be contaminated by \"Cryptosporidium\", the safest option is to boil all water used for drinking.\n\n\nCases of cryptosporidiosis can occur in a city with clean water; cases of cryptosporidiosis can have different origins. Like many fecal-oral pathogens, the disease can also be transmitted by contaminated food or poor hygiene. Testing of water, as well as epidemiological study, are necessary to determine the sources of specific infections. \"Cryptosporidium\" typically does not cause serious illness in healthy people. It may chronically sicken some children, as well as adults exposed and immunocompromised. A subset of the immunocompromised population is people with AIDS. Amongst MSM with AIDS, insertive anal sex is an increased risk factor. Analingus and oral-genital sex after anal-genital sex are known transmission routes.\n\nOther transmission routes include exposure to laboratory specimens.\n\n\n\n"}

Nationalist Movement\n\nForsyth County, Georgia v. The Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123 (1992), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court limited the ability of local governments to charge fees for the use of public places for private activities. By 5-4, the court ruled that an ordinance allowing the local government to set varying fees for different events violated the First Amendment due to the lack of \"narrowly drawn, reasonable, and definite standards\" governing the amount of the fee.\n\nPrior Supreme Court opinions had held that public officials could charge fees as a pre-condition for activists to assemble in public places or march down public streets. The rationale was that a fee to recover the costs of police protection, clean-up, and administrative costs did not violate the right to speak and assemble under the First Amendment. The fees sometimes ranged into the millions of dollars.\n\nOn January 17, 1987 a group of ninety demonstrators conducted a \"March Against Fear and Intimidation\" in Cumming, Forsyth County, Georgia that was met by as many as three hundred counter-protesters including the Forsyth County Defense League (an independent affiliate of the Nationalist Movement, which advocates the expulsion of all non-whites from the United States) and the Ku Klux Klan. According to Forsyth County, Georgia at least eight counter-protesters were arrested on charges of carrying concealed weapons and trespassing. The following weekend, January 24, 1987, there was a civil rights march attended by 20,000 integrationists, including civil rights leaders, U.S. senators and other senior officials. They were met again by about counter-protesters led by The Nationalist Movement.\n\nSixty-six Nationalists were arrested on charges of parading without a permit. In the aftermath, all Nationalists were acquitted. In U.S. Federal District Court in Atlanta, Judge William Clark O'Kelley dismissed the case, threatened to charge the Nationalists with perjury, fined them $8,000.00 for bringing a \"frivolous\" lawsuit and barred Richard Barrett, who also served as the Nationalists' attorney, from his court. \n\nOn appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, Barrett argued that no fees whatsoever could be charged; however, the court ruled for the Nationalists on the grounds that a \"nominal\" fee could be charged. Although there was a dispute over what was \"nominal,\" O'Kelley was reversed and the fines were vacated. O'Kelley rescinded his ban on the Nationalists' attorney. Forsyth County appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari. Robert S. Stubbs III and Gordon A. Smith, arguing on behalf of Forsyth County, insisted that the Girl Scouts and a local track club had been charged nominal fees, so the Nationalists were being treated equally. The American Civil Liberties Union filed an \"amicus\" brief in which they contended that a nominal fee of $100.00 sufficed.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the Nationalists on the ground that the ordinance unconstitutionally permitted the county to charge differing fees to different groups without any objective standards to prevent the county from basing the fee on the political views that a group sought to express. The court held that the ordinance violated the First Amendment due to the lack of \"narrowly drawn, reasonable, and definite standards\" governing the amount of the fee.\n\nNothing in the law or its application prevents the official from encouraging some views and discouraging others through the arbitrary application of fees. The First Amendment prohibits the vesting of such unbridled discretion in a government official.\n\nThe majority rejected Forsyth County's argument that the ordinance was content-neutral because it was aimed at offsetting the cost of maintaining public order:\n\nThe costs to which petitioner refers are those associated with the public's reaction to the speech. Listeners' reaction to speech is not a content-neutral basis for regulation.\n\nThe holding immediately impacted Simi Valley, California, which had banned the Nationalists on the grounds that they did not comply with regulations mandating a thirty-day waiting-period and that providing police protection was \"too costly.\" The city immediately rescinded its objections and provided police-protection. \n\nIn 2000, Morris County, New Jersey, sued the Nationalists, alleging that they could not parade and rally because they refused to post a $8 million bond. The Nationalists removed the case from state court to federal court in Newark, where Judge John W. Bissell held, in \"Morris County, New Jersey v. The Nationalist Movement,\" that although the bond was unconstitutional, officials could impose a \"hold-harmless\" clause, requiring the Nationalists to pay for damages caused by rioters against them. Bissell, also, refused to award attorney fees. On appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Bissell was reversed, all restrictions were struck down and substantial attorney fees awarded to the Nationalists. The U.S. Park Service immediately removed its requirement for similar fees and bonds, which it had interposed for the Nationalists' rally at the Liberty Bell. The event then proceeded, without restrictions and with full police protection. In the end, two Nationalists, Joshua Laub and Mathew McSweeney Sheard, were arrested for knocking over a speaker.\n\n\n"}

He wrote the screenplay for the feature film \"The Man Who Finally Died\" (1963), adapted from a television serial by Lewis Greifer, and \"Special Branch\" for Thames Television (1970).\n\nHe also wrote for \"Danger Man\" (US: \"Secret Agent\", 1964), and for the \"Doomwatch\" science fiction series and for \"Doctor Who\" on four occasions. The first of these, \"Planet of Giants\", opened the second season of the programme in 1964. His second script was \"Day of the Daleks\" (1972) and as originally written, the serial revolved around the Ogrons instead of the Daleks. During the Tom Baker years he wrote the \"Jekyll and Hyde\" script for \"Planet of Evil\"; and then \"The Masque of Mandragora\", which drew on his academic background and studies in Renaissance Italy.\n\nHe also served as a script editor on programmes such as \"Bedtime Stories\" (1974); \"The Stone Tape\" (1972); and \"No Exit\" (1972).\n\nMarks' producer credits include \"The Lost Boys\" (1978), \"Fearless Frank\" (1979), the BBC's adaptation of the Three Theban plays (between 1984 and 1986), and the BBC's adaptation of George Eliot's \"Middlemarch\" (1994). He worked with Jack Clayton on an adaption of Muriel Spark's \"Memento Mori\" (1991), Harold Pinter on \"The Hothouse\" (1987) and with Mike Leigh on \"Grown-Ups\" (1982). His production of \"Daniel Deronda\" by George Eliot was screened by the BBC in 2002.\n\nHe worked with distinguished actors including Anthony Hopkins, Claire Bloom, John Gielgud, Nigel Hawthorne, Michael Gambon, Judi Dench and Ben Kingsley on the adaptation of another George Eliot work \"Silas Marner\" (1985).\n\nMarks died on 17 September 2010.\n"}

He courted Agnes of Poitou on behalf of Conrad's son and successor Emperor Henry III. Bruno laid the corner-stone of Würzburg Cathedral, and in 1042 dedicated the Abbey of St. Burchard, rebuilt by Abbot Willemund.\n\nHe also accompanied Henry on his second Hungarian Campaign, during which Bruno died in an accident at Persenbeug on the Danube in the present Lower Austria.\n\nThe retinue of Henry III had stopped at the residence of Countess Richlinde of Ebersberg, who was faced with the task of distributing the estate of her recently deceased husband Count Adalbero II of Ebersberg. During a great banquet given by the countess a load-bearing pillar supporting the banqueting hall broke, causing the entire floor to collapse. The king was only slightly hurt but the countess, Bishop Bruno and Abbot Altmann of Ebersberg Abbey were so badly injured that they did not survive more than a few days. The Annals of Niederaltaich add a legend to the story: before the feast, at the \"Strudengau\" on the Danube near Grein, the devil was supposed to have appeared to the bishop and threatened him already, but the bishop was able to repel him. Bruno's body was returned to his residence in Würzburg.\n\nHe was succeeded by his nephew, Adalbero of Würzburg.\n\nMany cathedrals were built in that period, and from 1040 Bruno began the construction of Würzburg Cathedral. The consecration of the crypt on 16 June 1045 was combined with his burial. Bruno was not formally canonized by the Roman Catholic Church, but is nevertheless revered as a saint. His feast day is 27 May.\n\nBruno wrote a well-known commentary on the Psalms, to which he appended an analysis of ten Biblical hymns, consisting of extracts from the writings of the Church Fathers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2206900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206900", "title": "Carian language", "text": "Carian language\n\nThe Carian language is an extinct language of the Luwian subgroup of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European language family. The Carian language was spoken in Caria, a region of western Anatolia between the ancient regions of Lycia and Lydia, by the Carians, a name possibly first mentioned in Hittite sources. Carian is closely related to Lycian and Milyan (Lycian B), and both are closely related to, though not direct descendants of, Luwian. Whether the correspondences between Luwian, Carian, and Lycian are due to direct descent (i.e. a language family as represented by a tree-model), or are due to dialect geography, is disputed.\n\nPrior to the late 20th century CE the language remained a total mystery even though many characters of the script appeared to be from the Greek alphabet. Using Greek phonetic values of letters investigators of the 19th and 20th centuries were unable to make headway and classified the language as non-Indo-European. Speculations multiplied, none very substantial. Progress finally came as a result of rejecting the presumption of Greek phonetic values.\n\nCarian is known from these sources:\n\n\nIn the chart below, the Carian letter is given, followed by the transcription. Where the transcription differs from IPA, the phonetic value is given in brackets. Many Carian phonemes were represented by multiple letter forms in various locations. The Egypto-Carian dialect seems to have preserved semivowels w, j, and \"ý\" lost or left unwritten in other varieties\".\" Two Carian letters have unknown phonetic values: 𐊱 and 𐋆. The letter 𐊶 \"τ\" may have been equivalent to 𐋇 \"τ.\"\n\nAcross the various sites where inscriptions have been found, the two lateral phonemes /l/ and /λ/ contrast but may be represented by different letters of the Carian script 𐊣/𐋎, 𐊦, and 𐋃/𐋉 depending on the location. The letter 𐋉 (formerly transcribed <ŕ>) is now seen as an Egyptian variant of 𐋃 <ĺ>.\n\nIn the chart below, the Carian letter for each vowel is followed by the conventional transcription with the Greek equivalent in parentheses. An epenthetic schwa to break up clusters may have been unwritten.\n\nCarian nouns are inflected for at least three cases: nominative accusative, and genitive. The dative case is assumed to be present also, based on its relatives and the frequency of dedicatory inscriptions, but its form is quite unclear. Related Anatolian languages also distinguish between animate and inanimate noun genders.\n\nFeatures that help identify the language as Anatolian include the asigmatic nominative (without the Indo-European nominative ending *-s) but -s for a genitive ending: 𐊿𐊸𐊫𐊦 \"wśoλ\", 𐊿𐊸𐊫𐊦𐊰 \"wśoλ-s\". The similarity of the basic vocabulary to other Anatolian languages also confirms this e.g. 𐊭𐊺𐊢 \"ted\" \"father\"; 𐊺𐊵 \"en\" \"mother\". A variety of dative singular endings have been proposed, including zero-marked and -i/-e suffixation. No inanimate stem has been securely identified but the suffix \"-n\" may be reconstructed based on the inherited pattern. Alternatively, a zero ending may be derived from the historical *\"-od\". The locative case is attested in one phrase (𐊠𐊣𐊫𐊰𐊾 𐊴𐊠𐊥𐊵𐊫𐊰𐊾 \"alosδ k̂arnosδ\" \"in/from Halicarnassus(?)\"), perhaps originally a clitic derived from the preverb \"δ\" \"in, into\" < PIE *endo.\n\nThe Athenian Bilingual\n\nGreek: | <br>Carian: 𐊸𐋅𐊠𐊰 : 𐊰𐊠𐊵 𐊭𐊲𐊥 \"Śjas: san Tur\" <br>English: \"This is the tomb of Tur | the Carian, the son of Scylax\"\n\nThe word 𐊰𐊠𐊵 \"san\" is equivalent to τόδε and evidences the Anatolian language assibilation, parallel to Luwian za-, \"this.\" If 𐊸𐋅𐊠𐊰 \"śjas\" is not exactly the same as Σῆμα \"Sēma\" it is roughly equivalent.\n\nThe Achaean Greeks arriving in small numbers on the coasts of Anatolia in the Late Bronze Age found them occupied by a population that did not speak Greek and were generally involved in political relationships with the Hittite Empire. After the fall of the latter the region became the target of heavy immigration by Ionian and Dorian Greeks who enhanced Greek settlements and founded or refounded major cities. They assumed for purposes of collaboration new regional names based on their previous locations: Ionia, Doris.\n\nThe writers born in these new cities reported that the people among whom they had settled were called Carians and spoke a language that was \"barbarian\", \"barbaric\" or \"barbarian-sounding.\" No clue has survived from these writings as to what exactly the Greeks might mean by \"barbarian.\" The reportedly Carian names of the Carian cities did not and do not appear to be Greek. Such names as Andanus, Myndus, Bybassia, Larymna, Chysaoris, Alabanda, Plarasa and Iassus were puzzling to the Greeks, some of whom attempted to give etymologies in words they said were Carian. For the most part they still remain a mystery.\n\nWriting disappeared in the Greek Dark Ages but no earlier Carian writing has survived. When inscriptions, some bilingual, began to appear in the 7th century BCE it was already some hundreds of years after the city-naming phase. The earlier Carian may not have been exactly the same.\n\nThe local development of Carian excludes some other theories as well: it was not widespread in the Aegean, is not related to Etruscan, was not written in any ancient Aegean scripts, and was not a substrate Aegean language. Its occurrence in various places of Classical Greece is due only to the travel habits of Carians, who apparently became co-travellers of the Ionians. The Carian cemetery of Delos probably represents the pirates mentioned in classical texts. The Carians who fought for Troy (if they did) were not classical Carians any more than the Greeks there were classical Greeks.\n\nBeing penetrated by larger numbers of Greeks and under the domination from time to time of the Ionian League, Caria eventually Hellenized and Carian became a dead language. The interludes under the Persian Empire perhaps served only to delay the process. Hellenization would lead to the extinction of the Carian language in the 1st century BCE or early in the Common Era.\n\n\n\n"}

In the Chinookan language, Sahalee means \"high heavenly ground.\" The 27-hole course is located on a heavily forested plateau immediately east of Lake Sammamish.\n\nSahalee is best known as the site of the PGA Championship in 1998, the first of Vijay Singh's three major titles. It was also the host of the WGC-NEC Invitational in 2002, won by Craig Parry. The course's original architect was Ted Robinson; in preparation for the PGA Championship, Rees Jones renovated the course in 1996, 1997, and 1998. The course has been listed on \"Golf Digest's\" Top 100 Courses list for over twenty years, and is the host of the Sahalee Players Championship, a top amateur tournament in the region. It also was the site of the inaugural GTE Northwest Classic in 1986, a former senior tour event.\n\nAfter the success of the 1998 PGA Championship, Sahalee was selected in 1999 to host the championship again in 2010. That decision was reversed by the PGA of America in January 2005, when the 2010 event was abruptly moved to Whistling Straits in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, which had recently hosted the very profitable 2004 edition and set new attendance records. The PGA of America stated that it was concerned about the possibility of reduced financial support in the Pacific Northwest; it was scheduled to be held less than six months after the conclusion of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, BC.\n\nIn February 2007, the USGA selected Sahalee to host the U.S. Senior Open in 2010, held from July 29 to August 1. Bernhard Langer of Germany shot eight under par and won by three strokes over local favorite Fred Couples, Couples, originally from Seattle, was in his first full season on the Champions Tour.\n\nIn June 2016, Sahalee hosted a women's major, the KPMG Women's PGA Championship; Brooke Henderson defeated top-ranked Lydia Ko in a sudden-death playoff.\n\nSince Sahalee is a private course, guests can only play with a member; green fees for guests are $120. The pro shop is open from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. The dress code states that denim is not allowed and that a collared shirt is required; slacks or non-denim shorts are allowed. Metal spiked shoes are not allowed; neither are groups of five. The course is open year-round, and its greens are aerated in May and September. The greens and fairways are both Poa annua grass. Cell phones are not allowed within 100 yards of the clubhouse.\n\nThe course opened in 1969, following two years of construction at the then-remote site. The three nines were designed by golf course architect Ted Robinson. The first head professional was Paul Runyan, who won 29 times on the PGA Tour, including the PGA Championship twice, in 1934 and 1938. He played for the U.S. on four Ryder Cup teams, and won the Senior PGA Championship in 1961 and 1962.\n\nIn preparation for the 1998 PGA Championship, Rees Jones was brought in to renovate the courses. The South and North nines (where the championship was held) were renovated in 1996. The East course was renovated after the 1998 PGA Championship. The original clubhouse was replaced in 2001 with a new structure.\n\nSahalee is made up of three sets of nine holes; South, North, and East nines. PGA tournaments have been held on the combination of the South and North nines. The course is like many in the Pacific Northwest, with tall evergreen trees, primarily Douglas fir and red cedar, lining the narrow fairways. The course has many bunkers and several water hazards.\n\nOn average, each hole has five or six hazards. The East Course has two ponds that come into play on two of the holes. This is the same for the North Course and South Course. The North Course's fairways are slightly hilly, whereas the South Course and East Course have relatively flat fairways with the occasional hump to create an uneven lie.\n\nThe combination of the South and North courses creates a par 72 layout. From the black (back) tees, the course measures with a slope rating of 74.2/139. From the blue tees the course measures and has a slope rating of 73.4/138. From the white tees the course measures with a slope rating of 71.0/135. From the red tees the course measures with a slope rating of 72.8/127.

As a par 71, Robert Allenby holds the course record of 63, eight under par.\n\nLee Janzen said of Sahalee: \"I think the best way to prepare for this course would have been to go to a big city, like New York, and maybe play down Fifth Avenue ... With the trees being so large, and so close to the fairway, you immediately see the only shot you can possibly hit.

In 2009, \"The New York Times\" called Atlanta \"hip-hop's center of gravity\", and the city is home to many famous hip-hop, R&B and neo soul musicians.\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s Atlanta's hip hop scene was characterized by a local variant of Miami's electro-driven bass music, with stars like Kilo Ali, MC Shy-D, Raheem the Dream, and DJ Smurf (later Mr. Collipark). MC Shy-D is credited with bringing authentic Bronx-style hip-hop to Atlanta (and Miami), such as 1988's \"Shake it\" produced by DJ Toomp; Jones was signed to controversial Southern hip hop label Luke Records, run by Luther Campbell aka \"Uncle Luke\". Arrested Development won the Grammy in 1992 with \"Tennessee\", while Mr. Wendal & People Everyday and Kris Kross won with their hit song Jump. The group Tag Team released their debut platinum certified album Whoomp! (There It Is) on July 20, 1993, spawned by their hit single of the same name.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the rise of LaFace Records artists Outkast, Goodie Mob and the production collective Organized Noize led to the development of the Dirty South style of hip-hop and of Atlanta gaining a reputation for \"soul-minded hip-hop eccentrics\", contrasting with other regional styles. While Atlanta-area hip hop artists were from the suburban Decatur area, their prominence was eclipsed by music associated with these artists from \"The S.W.A.T.S.\" (\"Southwest Atlanta, too strong\"), i.e. Southwest Atlanta, plus territory extending into the adjacent cities of College Park and East Point. The term \"SWATS\" came into vogue around 1996, initially made popular by Outkast and Goodie Mob.\n\nFrom the late 1990s to early 2000s, record producer Lil Jon became a driving force behind the hip hop subgenre known as crunk, known for its upbeat and club oriented hip hop sound. Record producers L.A. Reid and Babyface founded LaFace Records in Atlanta in the late-1980s; the label eventually became the home to multi-platinum selling artists such as Toni Braxton, TLC, Ciara. It is also the home of So So Def Recordings, a label founded by Jermaine Dupri in the mid-1990s, that signed acts such as Da Brat, Jagged Edge, Xscape and Dem Franchise Boyz. The success of LaFace and SoSo Def led to Atlanta as an established scene for record labels such as LaFace parent company Arista Records to set up satellite offices.\n\nIn 2009 \"The New York Times\" noted that after 2000, Atlanta moved \"from the margins to becoming hip-hop's center of gravity, part of a larger shift in hip-hop innovation to the South.\" Atlanta hip-hop's pop breakthrough—everyone from Jermaine Dupri to OutKast to Lil Jon—involved the blend of various distillations of hard-core sounds from the West, bass beats from Florida, and styles and images from the North. Producer Drumma Boy called Atlanta \"the melting pot of the South\". Producer Fatboi called the Roland TR-808 (\"808\") synthesizer \"central\" to Atlanta music's versatility, used for snap, crunk, trap, and pop rap styles. The same article named Fatboi, Shawty Redd and Zaytoven the four \"hottest producers driving the city\".\n\nAs of 2018, Atlanta Trap music continues to dominate the pop music charts. In 2017, Atlanta recording artist Future had back-to-back releases that debuted at number one on the Billboard charts. Lil Yachty’s 2018 release \"Lil Boat 2\" opened at number 2.\n\nAtlanta hip-hop has influenced other mainstream forms of media. The television show \"Atlanta\", which chronicles the lives of two cousins as they navigate the hip-hop world, exemplifies this broader impact. It has earned two Golden Globe awards and two Emmy awards.\n\nLocal multi-platinum artists include Ludacris, Ciara, B.o.B, Outkast, Young Jeezy and T.I. The following hip-hop, rap, R&B and soul artists have had #1 or #2 albums or singles on the U.S. Hot 100 chart:\n"}

In a more specific sense, the rim may refer to the circular or elliptical edge that represents the uppermost tip of this raised portion. If there is no raised portion, the rim simply refers to the inside edge of the curve where the flat surface meets the curve of the crater bottom.\n\nSmaller, simple craters retain rim geometries similar to the features of many craters found on the Moon and the planet Mercury.\n\nLarge craters are those with a diameter greater than 2.3 km, and are distinguished by central uplifts within the impact zone. These larger (also called “complex”) craters can form rims up to several hundred meters in height.\n\nA process to consider when determining the exact height of a crater rim is that melt may have been pushed over the crest of the initial rim from the initial impact, thereby increasing its overall height. When combined with potential weathering due to atmospheric erosion over time, determining the average height of a crater rim can be somewhat difficult. It has also been observed that the slope along the excavated interior of many craters can facilitate a spur-and-gully morphology, including mass wasting events occurring due to slope instability and nearby seismic activity.\n\nComplex crater rims observed on Earth have anywhere between 5X – 8X greater height:diameter ratio compared to those observed on the Moon, which can likely be attributed to the greater force of gravitational acceleration between the two planetary bodies that collide. Additionally, crater depth and the volume of melt produced in the impact are directly related to the gravitational acceleration between the two bodies. It has been proposed that “reverse faulting and thrusting at the final crater rim [is] one of the main contributing factors [to] forming the elevated crater rim”. When an impact crater is formed on a sloped surface, the rim will form in an asymmetric profile. As the impacted surface's angle of repose increases, the crater's profile becomes more elongate.\n\nThe rim type classifications are full-rim craters, broken-rim craters, and depressions.\n"}

{"id": "2206965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206965", "title": "Rim (firearms)", "text": "Rim (firearms)\n\nA rim is an external flange that is machined, cast, molded, stamped or pressed around the bottom of a firearms cartridge. Thus, rimmed cartridges are sometimes called \"flanged\" cartridges. Almost all cartridges feature an extractor or headspacing rim, in spite of the fact that some cartridges are known as \"rimless cartridges\". The rim may serve a number of purposes, including providing a lip for the extractor to engage, and sometimes serving to headspace the cartridge.\n\nThere are various types of firearms rims in use in modern ammunition. These types are rimmed, rimless, semi-rimmed, rebated rim, and belted. These categories describe the size of the rim in relation to the base of the case.\n\nThe rimmed cartridge, sometimes called flanged cartridge, is the oldest of the types and has a rim that is significantly larger in diameter than the base of the cartridge. Rimmed cartridges use the rim to hold the cartridge in the chamber of the firearm, with the rim serving to hold the cartridge at the proper depth in the chamber—this function is called \"headspacing\". Because the rimmed cartridge headspaces on the rim, the case length is of less importance than with rimless cartridges.\n\nThis allows some firearms chambered for similar rimmed cartridges to safely chamber and fire shorter cartridges, such as using .38 Special cartridges in a .357 Magnum revolver. Rimmed cartridges are well suited to certain types of actions, such as revolvers and break-action firearms, where the rim helps hold the cartridge in position.\n\nRimmed cartridges generally do not work quite as well in firearms that feed from a box magazine, since the magazine must be carefully loaded so that the rim from each successive case is loaded ahead of the round beneath it, so the round will not snag on the rim of the cartridge below it as the bolt strips it out of the magazine. However, box magazine firearms firing rimmed cases have seen extensive use; the famous Lee–Enfield rifle used by the UK, and the Russian (later Soviet) Mosin-Nagant rifle, were both used from before World War I until after World War II. Semi-automatic handguns have been chambered in rimmed cartridges as well, for example a LAR Grizzly or Desert Eagle in .357 or .44 Magnum.\n\nSome types of rimmed cartridges, such as rimfire cartridges, also use the rim to contain the priming compound used to ignite the cartridge instead of a centrally-mounted primer such as used in centerfire cartridges.\n\nUnder the metric cartridge designation system, a capitalized \"R\" added at the end of the designation denotes a rimmed cartridge. For example, \"7.62×54mmR\" is a rimmed cartridge, while \"7.62×51mm\" is a rimless cartridge. Under Imperial designations, there is typically no distinction between rimmed and unrimmed cartridges, unless one is referring to a rimmed version of a cartridge which is typically rimless, such as the .45 Auto Rim, a special rimmed version of the .45 ACP (aka \".45 Auto\"), intended for use in M1917 service revolvers.\n\nExamples of rimmed handgun cartridges include the .38 Special, .357 Magnum and .44 Magnum. Rimmed rifle cartridge examples include the .22 Hornet, .303 British and 7.62×54mmR.\n\nOn a \"rimless\" case, the rim has almost or exactly the same diameter as the base of the case; the recess formed between the rim and the body of the cartridge is known as an extractor groove, since it forms a lip which can be grasped by an \"extractor\" to extract the empty case after being fired. Since there is no rim projecting past the edge of the case, the cartridge must headspace on the case mouth, for a straight walled case, or on the case's shoulder for a bottlenecked case (although a bottlenecked case \"can\" headspace on the case mouth, depending on the cartridge); the extractor groove serves only for extraction. The lack of a projecting rim makes rimless cases feed very smoothly from box magazines, and they are primarily used in firearms that feed from a box magazine, although they also work well in belt, drum and tube-fed weapons. Rimless cases are not well suited to break-open and revolver actions, though they can be used with appropriate modifications, such as a spring-loaded extractor or, in a revolver, a moon clip (for example, the Colt or Smith & Wesson M1917 revolvers in .45ACP).\n\nSince a straight-walled rimless cartridge is designed to headspace off of the case mouth, this prevents the ammunition loader or manufacturer from using a heavy crimp, which is a ring pinched or \"crimped\" into the cartridge case, designed to lock the bullet securely in place until fired. Crimping affects the overall length of the cartridge, and thus cannot be used on cartridges which headspace on the case mouth. This can be a problem for magnum revolvers or rifles which hold more than one round of ammunition, as the recoil from the firing successive rounds can loosen the bullets in the remaining cartridges, and cause their bullet seating depth to change, which can have a serious effect of accuracy. This is not an issue for break-action \"single shot\" firearms, for obvious reasons, although it could potentially cause problems in double rifles or \"drilling\"-type big game rifles, provided they have more than one rifle barrel (some \"drillings\" are made with three or more rifle barrels, without any shotgun component).\n\nExamples of rimless handgun cartridges include the 9mm Parabellum, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP. Rimless rifle examples include the .223 Remington, .308 Winchester, .30-06 Springfield and 7.92×57mm Mauser.\n\nOn a semi-rimmed case the rim projects slightly beyond the base of the case, though not as much as a rimmed cartridge. The tiny rim provides minimal interference feeding from a box magazine, while still providing enough surface to headspace on. Semi-rimmed cases are less common than the other types. \n\nThe .38 Super, a higher pressure loading of the old .38 ACP case, is notorious for being less accurate than rimless cases, and so most modern .38 Super handguns are chambered so that the cartridge headspaces off the case mouth, like a rimless case. If the chamber is cut shallow, so the case headspaces off the mouth, the rim is used for extraction only; a standard chamber will use the rim for both headspacing and extraction.\n\nExamples of more commonly encountered semi-rimmed handgun cartridges are .25 ACP, .32 ACP and .38 ACP, while the .308 Marlin Express, .338 Marlin Express and .444 Marlin are rifle cartridges that are semi-rimmed.\n\nRebated rim cartridges have a rim that is significantly smaller in diameter than the base of the case, serving only for extraction. Functionally the same as a rimless case, the rebated rim provides some additional benefits when considered in conjunction with other cartridges. \n\nOne example of a rebated rim cartridge is the .50 Action Express (or .50 AE), commonly chambered in the Desert Eagle pistol. In order to simplify production, and to decrease the cost of ownership, the .50 AE was designed with a rebated rim which matched the diameter of the rim of the .44 Magnum, which was the most common caliber used in the Desert Eagle. By using the same rim dimensions as the .44 Magnum, a Desert Eagle could be converted from .44 Magnum to .50 AE by merely changing the barrel and magazine. Other convertible cartridges, such as the short-lived .41 Action Express (with the same rim diameter as 9×19mm Parabellum) used in the Jericho 941 convertible pistol and Uzi submachine gun and carbine, would function in the same magazine, and thus required only a barrel change to change caliber.\n\nThe recent (early 2000s) Winchester Short Magnum, Winchester Super Short Magnum, and Remington Ultra Magnum and Remington Short Action Ultra Magnum families of rifle cartridges also feature rebated rims. All of these cases were based on the .404 Jeffery with the rim reduced from .543 inches to fit the .532 inch bolt face for existing magnum rifles.\n\nThe .50 Beowulf uses a rebated rim design. This round is used in specialized AR-15 upper receivers, and the rim matches the size of the rim of the 7.62×39mm, allowing those parts to be used in the custom-built upper receivers.\n\nRebated rims were also a feature of the cartridges of automatic cannons derived from the 20-mm Becker, of which the best known belong to the Oerlikon family. These \"advanced primer ignition\" (API) blowback weapons feature straight-sided chambers that are longer than necessary to contain the case. The face of the bolt has the same diameter as the case and follows it into the chamber. This means that the extraction claw also has to fit within the chamber, and therefore the case has a rebated rim. Another well known cartridge to use a rebated rim is the FN 5.7x28mm, used in the FN Five-seveN semi-automatic handgun and FN P90 personal defense weapon.\n\nThe original purpose of the \"belt\" on belted cases (often referred to as belted magnums) was to provide headspacing; the extractor groove is cut into the belt just as it is cut into the case head on a rimless case. The belt acts as a rim on what is essentially a rimless case. The design originated in England around 1910 with the .400/375 Belted Nitro Express (also known as the .375/.400 Holland & Holland, and .375 Velopex). The addition of the belt allowed the cartridge to properly headspace, despite the relative lack of a definite shoulder. The reason for the lack of a definitive shoulder was that these old British cartridge cases were intended for firing cordite charges instead of modern smokeless powder. Cordite was extruded as spaghetti-like rods, so the cartridge cases had to be fairly cylindrical shaped to accommodate the cordite propellant rods. The belt was carried through on other cartridges derived from the .375 Velopex, like the .375 Holland & Holland Magnum of 1912, in some cases to prevent the higher-pressure magnum cartridge from accidentally being chambered in a gun with a chamber of similar size.\n\nIn the USA, the belt became somewhat synonymous with \"magnum\" during the late 20th century. More recently, new \"magnum\" cartridges introduced in the USA have been rimless or used rebated rims based on the .404 Jeffery that fit the same .512\" bolt face used for the belted cases.\n\n"}

He also wrote on races.\n\nBorn in Liège, he was the only son of an ancient and noble family, and his education was carefully directed. After completing his classical studies in his home town he was sent to Paris in 1801 by his parents to avail himself of the social and literary advantages of the metropolis. A lively interest, however, in geology awakened by the works of Buffon, directed his steps to the museums and the Jardin des Plantes.\n\nHe visited Paris again in 1803 and 1805, and during these periods attended the lectures of Fourcroy, Lacépède, and Georges Cuvier. His homeward journeys were usually made the occasion of a geological expedition through northern France. As early as 1808 he communicated to the \"Journal des Mines\" a paper entitled \"Essai sur la géologie du Nord de la France\". He thus conceived the project of making a series of surveys throughout the whole country. This was furthered by a commission to execute a geological map of the empire which brought with it exemption from military duty.\n\nHe devoted himself energetically to the work and by 1813 had traversed over 15,500 miles in France and portions of Italy. His family had, however, but little sympathy with his geological activity, and persuaded him to give up his expeditions. The map which he had made of France and the neighbouring territories was not published until 1822 and served as a basis for the more detailed surveys of Armand Dufrénoy and Elie de Beaumont. After having served as sous-intendant of the arrondissement of Dinant (1814) and general secretary of the province of Liège (1815), he became in 1815 governor of Namur. He held this office until after the Revolution of 1830. He was elected a member of the Belgian Senate in 1848, became its vice-president in 1851, was made a member of the Academy of Brussels in 1816, and was elected its president in 1850.\n\nIn the third edition of \"On the Origin of Species\" published in 1861, Charles Darwin added a \"Historical Sketch\" giving due credit to naturalists who had preceded him in publishing the opinion that species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of life have descended by true generation from pre-existing forms. This included d'Halloy –\n\nAs a statesman Halloy had at heart the well-being of the people and, though his duties allowed him little opportunity for extended geological research, he retained a lively interest in his favourite science and engaged occasionally in field work. In his later years he gave much attention to questions of ethnology and philosophy. His death was hastened by the exertions of a scientific expedition undertaken alone in his ninety-first year. He died in Brussels on 15 January 1875.\n\nHalloy was one of the pioneers of modern geology, and in particular laid the foundation of geological knowledge over wide areas. He made important studies in the Carboniferous districts of Belgium and the Rhine provinces and in the Tertiary deposits of the Paris basin. He was a practicing Catholic during his long and active life, and was characterized by his loyalty and devotion to the Church. He insisted on the harmony between faith and science, making this the subject of his oration on the occasion of the golden jubilee of the Belgian Academy in 1866. Among his published works are: \"Description géologique des Pays-Bas\" (1828); \"Eléments de Géologie\" (1831); \"Introduction à la Géologie\" (1833); \"Coup d'oeil sur la géologie de la Belgique\" (1842); \"Precis elementaire de Géologie\" (1843); \"Abrégé de Géologie\" (1853); \"Des Races humaines ou Eléments d' Ethnographie\" (1845). In this last book, Halloy established a racial classification according to skin colour.\n\nHe was an active member of the Belgian Academy of Sciences from 1816, and served three times as president. He was likewise president of the Geological Society of France in 1852. He studied also in detail the Tertiary deposits of the Paris Basin, and ascertained the extent of the Cretaceous and some of the older strata, which he for the first time clearly depicted on a map (1817). He was distinguished as an ethnologist, and when nearly ninety years of age he was chosen president of the Congress of Pre-historic Archaeology (Brussels, 1872).\n\n"}

{"id": "2206984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206984", "title": "Lithium battery", "text": "Lithium battery\n\nLithium batteries are primary batteries that have metallic lithium as an anode. These types of batteries are also referred to as lithium-metal batteries.\n\nThey stand apart from other batteries in their high charge density (long life) and high cost per unit. Depending on the design and chemical compounds used, lithium cells can produce voltages from (comparable to a zinc–carbon or alkaline battery) to about .\n\nDisposable primary lithium batteries must be distinguished from secondary lithium-ion or a lithium-polymer, which are rechargeable batteries. Lithium is especially useful, because its ions can be arranged to move between the anode and the cathode, using an intercalated lithium compound as the cathode material but without using lithium metal as the anode material. Pure lithium will instantly react with water, or even moisture in the air; the lithium in lithium ion batteries is in a less reactive compound.\n\nLithium batteries are widely used in portable consumer electronic devices, and in electric vehicles ranging from full sized vehicles to radio controlled toys. The term \"lithium battery\" refers to a family of different lithium-metal chemistries, comprising many types of cathodes and electrolytes but all with metallic lithium as the anode. The battery requires from 0.15 to 0.3 kg of lithium per kWh. As designed these primary systems use a charged cathode, that being an electro-active material with crystallographic vacancies that are filled gradually during discharge.\nThe most common type of lithium cell used in consumer applications uses metallic lithium as anode and manganese dioxide as cathode, with a salt of lithium dissolved in an organic solvent.\n\nUniversity of California San Diego have developed an electrolyte chemistry that allows lithium batteries to run at temperatures as low as -60 °. The electrolytes also enable electrochemical capacitors to run as low as -80 °C. Previous low-temperature limit is -40 °C. High performance at room temperature is still maintained. This may improve energy density and safety of lithium batteries and electrochemical capacitors.\n\nLithium batteries find application in many long-life, critical devices, such as pacemakers and other implantable electronic medical devices. These devices use specialized lithium-iodide batteries designed to last 15 or more years. But for other, less critical applications such as in toys, the lithium battery may actually outlast the device. In such cases, an expensive lithium battery may not be cost-effective.\n\nLithium batteries can be used in place of ordinary alkaline cells in many devices, such as clocks and cameras. Although they are more costly, lithium cells will provide much longer life, thereby minimizing battery replacement. However, attention must be given to the higher voltage developed by the lithium cells before using them as a drop-in replacement in devices that normally use ordinary zinc cells.\nLithium batteries also prove valuable in oceanographic applications. While lithium battery packs are considerably more expensive than standard oceanographic packs, they hold up to three times the capacity of alkaline packs. The high cost of servicing remote oceanographic instrumentation (usually by ships) often justifies this higher cost.\n\nSmall lithium batteries are very commonly used in small, portable electronic devices, such as PDAs, watches, camcorders, digital cameras, thermometers, calculators, personal computer BIOS (firmware), communication equipment and remote car locks. They are available in many shapes and sizes, with a common variety being the 3 volt \"coin\" type manganese variety, typically 20 mm in diameter and 1.6–4 mm thick.\nThe heavy electrical demands of many of these devices make lithium batteries a particularly attractive option. In particular, lithium batteries can easily support the brief, heavy current demands of devices such as digital cameras, and they maintain a higher voltage for a longer period than alkaline cells.\n\nLithium primary batteries account for 28% of all primary battery sales in Japan but only 1% of all battery sales in Switzerland. In the EU only 0.5% of all battery sales including secondary types are lithium primaries.\n\nThe computer industry's drive to increase battery capacity can test the limits of sensitive components such as the membrane separator, a polyethylene or polypropylene film that is only 20–25 µm thick. The energy density of lithium batteries has more than doubled since they were introduced in 1991. When the battery is made to contain more material, the separator can undergo stress.\n\nLithium batteries can provide extremely high currents and can discharge very rapidly when short-circuited. Although this is useful in applications where high currents are required, a too-rapid discharge of a lithium battery - especially if cobalt is present in the cells' design - can result in overheating of the battery (that lowers the electrical resistance of any cobalt content within the cell), rupture, and even an explosion. Lithium-thionyl chloride batteries are particularly susceptible to this type of discharge. Consumer batteries usually incorporate overcurrent or thermal protection or vents to prevent an explosion as a part of battery management system.\n\nFrom January 1, 2013, much stricter regulations were introduced by IATA regarding the carriage of lithium batteries by air. They were adopted by the International Postal Union; however, some countries, e.g. the UK, have decided that they will not accept lithium batteries unless they are included with the equipment they power.\n\nBecause of the above risks, shipping and carriage of lithium batteries is restricted in some situations, particularly transport of lithium batteries by air.\n\nThe United States Transportation Security Administration announced restrictions effective January 1, 2008 on lithium batteries in checked and carry-on luggage. The rules forbid lithium batteries not installed in a device from checked luggage and restrict them in carry-on luggage by total lithium content.\n\nAustralia Post prohibited transport of lithium batteries in air mail during 2010.\n\nUK regulations for the transport of lithium batteries were amended by the National Chemical Emergency Centre in 2009.\n\nIn late 2009, at least some postal administrations restricted airmail shipping (including Express Mail Service) of lithium batteries, lithium-ion batteries and products containing these (such as laptops and cell phones). Among these countries are Hong Kong, United States, and Japan.\n\nUnused lithium batteries provide a convenient source of lithium metal for use as a reducing agent in methamphetamine labs. Some jurisdictions have passed laws to restrict lithium battery sales or asked businesses to make voluntary restrictions in an attempt to help curb the creation of illegal meth labs. In 2004 Wal-Mart stores were reported to limit the sale of disposable lithium batteries to three packages in Missouri and four packages in other states.\n\nButton cell batteries are attractive to small children and often ingested. In the past 20 years, although there has not been an increase in the total number of button cell batteries ingested in a year, researchers have noted a 6.7-fold increase in the risk that an ingestion would result in a moderate or major complication and 12.5-fold increase in fatalities comparing the last decade to the previous one.\n\nThe primary mechanism of injury with button battery ingestions is the generation of hydroxide ions, which cause severe chemical burns, at the anode. This is an electrochemical effect of the intact battery, and does not require the casing to be breached or the contents released. Complications include oesophageal strictures, tracheo-oesophageal fistulas, vocal cord paralysis, aorto-oesophageal fistulas, and death. The majority of ingestions are not witnessed; presentations are non-specific; battery voltage has increased; the 20 to 25 mm button battery size are more likely to become lodged at the cricopharyngeal junction; and severe tissue damage can occur within 2 hours. The 3 V, 20 mm CR2032 lithium battery has been implicated in many of the complications from button battery ingestions by children of less than 4 years of age.\n\nWhile the only cure for an esophageal impaction is endoscopic removal, a 2018 study out of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia by Rachel R. Anfang and colleagues found that early and frequent ingestion of honey or sucralfate suspension prior to the battery's removal can reduce the injury severity to a significant degree. As a result, US-based National Capital Poison Center (Poison Control) recommends the use of honey and sucralfate after known or suspected ingestions to reduce the risk and severity of injury to esophagus, and consequently its nearby structures.\n\nButton batteries can also cause significant necrotic injury when stuck in the nose or ears. Prevention efforts in the US by the National Button Battery Task force in cooperation with industry leaders have led to changes in packaging and battery compartment design in electronic devices to reduce a child's access to these batteries. However, there still is a lack of awareness across the general population and medical community to its dangers. Central Manchester University Hospital Trust warns that \"a lot of doctors are unaware that this can cause harm\".\n\nRegulations for disposal and recycling of batteries vary widely; local governments may have additional requirements over those of national regulations. In the United States, one manufacturer of lithium iron disulfide primary batteries advises that consumer quantities of used cells may be discarded in municipal waste, as the battery does not contain any substances controlled by US Federal regulations. Another manufacturer states that \"button\" size lithium batteries contain perchlorate, which is regulated as a hazardous waste in California; regulated quantities would not be found in typical consumer use of these cells.\n\nAs lithium in used but non working (i.e. extended storage) button cells is still likely to be in the cathode cup, it is possible to extract commercially useful quantities of the metal from such cells as well as the manganese dioxide and specialist plastics. From experiment the usual failure mode is that they will read 3.2 V or above but be unable to generate useful current (<5 mA versus >40 mA for a good new cell)\nSome also alloy the lithium with magnesium (Mg) to cut costs and these are particularly prone to the mentioned failure mode.\n\n"}

Hoëk (voiced by John Kricfalusi in Seasons 1-2 and Adult Party Cartoon, Billy West in Seasons 3-5 and most laughter and screaming, and Chris Edgerly in \"Nicktoons MLB\") is a scrawny \"Asthma-Hound\" Chihuahua with a fairly long, rat-like, pink tail (which constantly disappears due to the character's animation limits) and tan fur. Martin \"Dr. Toon\" Goodman of Animation World Magazine described Ren as \"scrawny,\" \"dyspeptic,\" and \"violently psychotic.\" On some occasions Ren \"lost his mind\" in a \"cumulative process,\" resulting in Ren becoming, in Goodman's words, a \"screaming klaxon, neon-pink eyes dilating into twin novae inches above his jagged, monolithic teeth.\" Andy Meisler of The New York Times described Ren as \"adventurous,\" \"intelligent,\" and \"emotionally brittle.\"\n\nKricfalusi originally voiced Ren in a manner that he describes as \"a bad imitation of Peter Lorre.\" Billy West said that he auditioned to play Ren; the creators of the series believed that having West voice Ren and Stimpy would give him too large of a workload. West would, however, take over Ren's voice after Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi. Kricfalusi would return for the Spike TV episodes and unaired episodes of \"The Ren and Stimpy Show\". In the pilot, Pierre Decelles provided Ren's signature diabolical laughter, while West performed Ren's maniacal laugh in the series.\n\nKricfalusi complained about Nickelodeon executives requesting for Ren to have \"a softer side.\"\n\nBill Wray said that Ren was his favorite character to write for; Wray described Ren as \"fun\" because \"you can make him mean.\" In 1993 he added that, \"It drives me crazy when I tell people I work on the show and they always say, 'Make Ren meaner'.\"\n\nStimpson \"Stimpy\" J. Cat (voiced by Billy West in the series, Eric Bauza in Adult Party Cartoon) is a fat, red and white Manx cat (described by George Liquor as a \"Cornish Rex Hound\" to enter him in a dog show) with a large blue nose, purple eyelids, no tail, white gloves with fingernails on them, human-style buttocks, flat feet and a brain the size of a peanut (despite some intelligence, such as when cooking and inventing). Martin \"Dr. Toon\" Goodman of Animation World Magazine described Stimpy as \"obese\" and \"brain-damaged\". Andy Meisler of \"The New York Times\" described Stimpy as \"barrel-chested\" and \"good-natured\".\n\nStimpy's trademark facial expression is a blissfully ignorant smile with his tongue flopping out. Most of the time when he gets excited, he says his famous catchphrase, \"Oh, joy!\" or simply \"Joy\". He also has a strong attachment to his \"first material possession\" which is a litter box (given to him in the pilot episode) and even though Ren destroys it (by bashing it on his head in \"Fire Dogs\" or dumping it in acid in \"Ren's Bitter Half\"), Stimpy always reacts strongly to it by crying, panicking or fainting, though it always appears again in some later episode. Stimpy is named after an art school classmate of Kricfalusi, whose nickname was \"Stimpy Cadogen\" (\"Killer Cadogen\" was Stimpy's pseudonym in several episodes, and in a few others he is referred to as Stimpleton Cadogen). Billy West, who voiced Stimpy, said that he based Stimpy's voice on a \"sped up\" Larry Fine of The Three Stooges. West described Stimpy as one of his favorite characters. Eric Bauza voiced Stimpy in the \"Ren & Stimpy \"Adult Party Cartoon\"\" because West believed that the series had no humor and that voicing Stimpy in it would damage his career, as West later said in an interview.\n\nStimpy likes to create destructive electronic devices and feels a fixation for \"sensory pleasures of fresh kitty litter\".\n\nBill Wray described Stimpy as his favorite character to draw. Wray said that Stimpy has \"a huge range of emotion\".\n\nMr. Horse (voiced by John Kricfalusi in Seasons 1-2 and Adult Party Cartoon, Billy West in Seasons 3-5) was one of the most popular characters, appearing in many episodes in a wide variety of non-continuous roles. Mr. Horse has variously been a victim of a fall from a skyscraper, a GI returning from war in love with a sheep, a dog-show judge, a neighbor hiding a dark past, and a tester for Gritty Kitty cat litter. He has also been portrayed as a psychiatrist.\n\nMr. Horse is anthropomorphic, similar to the title characters—he is physically a full-sized male horse, but he usually stands on two legs and speaks. Mr. Horse is typically depicted as a straight-talking, thoughtful and serious character. He can also be cynical and disgruntled, and on occasion is merely a horse. His catchphrase is \"No sir, I don't like it.\" He in fact does say other things in response to Stimpy in the Gritty Kitty Litter Commercial. Mr. Horse was voiced by John Kricfalusi originally. After Kricfalusi's departure from the show, he was voiced by Billy West.\n\n\nPowdered Toast Man (voiced by Gary Owens in most appearances, Darrin J. Sargent in first \"Powdered Toast Man\" commercial, Corey Burton in \"Nicktoons MLB\") , is a melodramatic superhero and a spokesperson for Powdered Toast, the breakfast treat that \"tastes just like sawdust\". He was based on a Frank Zappa-inspired character called Studebacher Hoch, from the song \"Billy the Mountain\". The character appeared in various Powdered Toast commercials within \"The Ren & Stimpy Show\", and starred in two of its episodes: \"Powdered Toast Man vs. Waffle Woman\" and \"Powdered Toast Man\" (with Frank Zappa as \"the Pope\"). Powdered Toast Man hides his true identity behind the disguise of Pastor Toastman, a youth deacon.\n\nPowdered Toast Man is endowed with various abilities and like many superheroes, has a mysterious background and an alter ego. The character's catch phrase is \"Leave everything to me\".\n\nPowdered Toast Man can fly, either by releasing flatulence, or by inserting his head into a special toaster and launching from it, or merely by pushing off from the ground. IHe also flies backwards. He can hover in mid-air as well. His powers include some offensive weapons: high-velocity raisins shot from his mouth, hyper-corrosive croutons fired from his armpit, butter pats that are launched from the top of his head, and hyper-acidic marmalade from his navel. There are several signals that alert Powdered Toast Man to danger, his tongue phone, the inflation of his briefs, the dissipation of the toast particles in his head, or the reading of emergency messages encoded in slices of olive loaf.\n\nHe is apparently made entirely of Powdered Toast, as he can produce fully formed similar toast by flicking his wrist or by separating his head (which is made of two pieces of toast) and scraping the interior with a butter knife. His head is therefore depicted as being made of two identical pieces of toast, each complete with a face.\n\nBy day, Powdered Toast Man is Pastor Toastman, a \"cool youth deacon\". His disguise is composed of a pair of thick black spectacles and a pastor's collar, a possible parody of Superman's thinly disguised alter ego, Clark Kent. Pastor Toastman's office also serves as his headquarters, and he is served by a lovely young female assistant named \"Catholic High School Girl\" and it is strongly suggested that the two have a romantic relationship.\n\nMost of Powdered Toast Man's accomplishments are dubious and pyrrhic - if he ever succeeds it is usually accidentally, and at the cost of unintentionally inflicting havoc on someone else. Additionally, he fights for the sake of Ignorance and Prejudice.\n\n\nThe product named after Powdered Toast Man is true to its name — toast in powder form. Throwing doubt as to its appeal, toast is usually served warm, but powdered toast is room temperature.\n\nThe product comes in a can with an aerated top, allowing the toast to be \"sprinkled\" out in a manner similar to that of shredded Parmesan cheese. The powder somehow comes together, forming a piece of toast that can be consumed. Perhaps itself a commentary on the obsession of American culture with quickly prepared pre-made foods, it seems to take more time to \"make\" a piece of cold, sawdust-tasting Powdered Toast than it would to toast a piece of bread.\n\nPowdered Toast is never seen being consumed with butter, jam, or cream cheese, possibly because the fragile nature of the toast could not support such spreads. Though it's \"jam-packed with Vitamin F,\" Powdered Toast doesn't make children smarter.\n\nIn the first commercial, at the beginning of Robin Höek/Nurse Stimpy, Ren asks Stimpy, \"Isn't he wonderful?\" Stimpy then says, \"Why, He's TOAST-A-RIFIC!\"\n\nMuddy Mudskipper (voiced by Harris Peet) is a mudskipper (a species of fish capable of crawling out of water and breathing air through its skin) with the voice and personality of a grizzled vaudeville comedian who hosts an afternoon kids' show.\n\nMuddy is an archetype — the old, jaded comedian who is outstanding at being \"on\" when on stage but sour and dissatisfied off-stage. There are certain parallels between Muddy and Krusty the Clown from \"The Simpsons\" — both have television shows that may or may not be for children, both shower their co-stars with abuse, and behind the scenes they are less than pleasant to be around. He calls everyone he meets \"a lousy bum\".\n\nBesides being a huge television star, Muddy has dabbled in villainy, at one point kidnapping the Pope (voiced by Frank Zappa) before being foiled by Powdered Toast Man. His name is a parody of Woody Woodpecker. \n\nThe show's theme song (written by John Kricfalusi, Bob Camp & Charlie Brissette) plays up Muddy's particular physical traits:\n\n\"Who's the greatest mudskipper of them all?\"\n\"Who can skip thru the mud with the greatest of ease?\"\n\"What kind of wonderful guy?\"\n\"Who can crawl like a dog without scraping his knees?\"\n\"Who's got segmented eyes?\"\n\"It's Muddy Mudskipper!\"\n\"It's Muddy!\"\n\"Mudskipper!\"\n\"It's the Muddy!\"\n\"Mudskipper show!!!\"\n\n\nMuddy's lines would also be used as archive recording from these last three episodes for Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Pipe (voiced by Billy West and Cheryl Chase) are a 1950s' sitcom-styled white suburban couple who are seen only from the waist down. Mr. Pipe is typically seen with a pipe and clad in a bathrobe, slippers, and black socks supported by sock-suspenders. He loves to wear rubber nipples on his knees and farts at inappropriate moments. Mrs. Pipe appears to wear a dress and nondescript women's shoes. Their first appearance was \"The Boy Who Cried Rat\", in which Ren and Stimpy got a job catching mice for them. In \"Big Baby Scam,\" it seems they have two children named Eugene and Shawn. \n\nThe Announcer Salesman (also known as \"That Guy\") serves as the multi-purpose loudmouth in the \"Ren and Stimpy\" show. Sometimes, he is a salesman (\"Feud for Sale\", \"To Salve and Salve Not!\".) Other times, he is a narrator, an announcer, a dog-show judge, a real estate agent, etc. The character is never referred to by any name in the series, but the name of \"Hey, It's That Guy\" seems to be the official name given by West, who also voiced him. He first appeared in \"Space Madness\" provoking Stimpy to press the history eraser button. He bears a slight resemblance to the genie from Disney's \"Aladdin\". He had a moustache in \"House of Next Tuesday\". He was voiced by Billy West.\n\nHaggis McHaggis is short, bald stereotypical Scotsman. At one point, he was a cartoon star, but low ratings forced him out into the street. Voiced by Alan Young, the same voice actor for Scrooge McDuck.\n\nWilbur Cobb (voiced by comedian Jack Carter) is a demented, decaying old man who was once the foremost cartoon producer in the world. He speaks in malapropisms and suffers from a malady that results in body parts falling off. In the episode \"Stimpy's Cartoon Show\", Ren & Stimpy show Cobb their own film \"I Like Pink\" (with Explodey the Pup) in hopes the powerful producer will give them their big break. Voiced by Jack Carter, his final appearance was in \"The Last Temptation of Ren\", where he was the gardener for God. Spumco originally wanted his name to be Raymond Spum but after the firing of Spumco, Games renamed him Wilbur Cobb after the story editor.\n\nThe Fire Chief has a psychotic hatred for circus midgets and a penchant for slamming his fire axe into concrete as a response to answering the door. Voiced by Peet, and later by Ralph Bakshi in the \"Adult Party Cartoon\" episode \"Fire Dogs 2\".\n\nMrs. Buttloaves is an incredibly obese and homely old woman dressed in a bulging pink night gown and hair curlers. She first appeared in \"Fire Dogs\". Voiced by John Kricfalusi and Billy West.\n\nGeorge Liquor is an ultra-patriotic American and is so conservative that he thinks Republicans are Communists. When episodes featuring him were aired on Nickelodeon, his family name was edited out. Instead, the scene would pause and a record-scratching sound effect would be played in place of the word \"Liquor\". According to John K, he's Ren and Stimpy's official owner. He was voiced by Michael Pataki, but Harris Peet voiced him two pre-George characters in \"The Boy Who Cried Rat\" and \"Black Hole,\" .\n\n"}

Gottschalk\n\nJacob Gottschalk (Godtschalk) Henricks van der Heggen (c.1670 – c.1763) was the first person to serve as a Mennonite bishop in America.\n\nGottschalk was born around 1670 in Germany, in Goch, a town at the Dutch border. In 1701, he received a letter from the church in Goch, permitting him to migrate to Pennsylvania, where he arrived at Germantown, Pennsylvania in 1702. On August 10, 1702, he became a preacher to the Mennonite congregation there.\n\nHe died in May 1763, and his grave is unmarked; however, there is a memorial stone at the Towamencin Meeting church yard at Kulpsville, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania that reads:\n\nIn memory of Bishop Jacob Gottshall 1670-1763 Born in Goch Germany, ordained a bishop in the Germantown Mennonite Church in 1702 and also served the Skippack and Towamencin congregations. He performed the first baptism and conducted the first communion service in the American church in 1708. The Skippack alms audits were signed by him from 1745-1757. He owned a farm of which included this church site. Undoubtedly, he is buried here but no marker remains, therefore this marker is erected in memory of this energetic leader.\n\nAround 1690 the Germantown Mennonite congregation elected William Rittenhouse as its first preacher and Jan Neuss as a deacon. The first ordained bishop of the congregation was Jacob Gottschalk who came to America in 1702.\n\nIn 1708 Jacob joined in a letter to friends in Amsterdam requesting their European friends to send them some catechisms, besides psalm books and Bibles as there was but one copy of the Bible in their whole membership.\n\nIn 1712, had the Dordrecht Confession of Faith translated into English and printed.\n\nIn 1725, he met with sixteen other ministers from southeastern Pennsylvania and adopted the Dutch Mennonite Dordrecht Confession of Faith (1632). They also wrote the following endorsement of which he was the first to sign:\n\nWe the hereunder written Servants of the Word of God, and Elders in the Congregation of the People, called Mennonists, in the Province of Pennsylvania, do acknowledge, and herewith make known, that we do own the foregoing Confession, Apendix, and Menno's Excusation, to be according to our Opinion; and also, have took the same to be wholly ours. In Testimony whereof, and that we believe that same to be good, we have here unto Subscribed our Names.\n\nIn 1745, he arranged with the Ephrata Cloister to have them translate from Dutch into German and print Thieleman J. van Braght's 1660 The Bloody Theatre or Martyrs Mirror of Defensless Christians, the work took 15 men three years to finish and in 1749, at 1512 pages, was the largest book printed in America before the Revolutionary War. One of the original volumes is now on display at the Ephrata Cloister.\n\nJacob Gottschalk was the son of Gottschalk Thonis (Theunissen) and Lehntgen Henrichs. His surname, Gottschalk, was a patronymic where he was born. Sometime after he moved to America he began to use versions of Gottschalk as his family name.\n\nJacob's children, as listed in his will, were son Herman, deceased son Godshalk, deceased son John, deceased daughter Magadalene, and daughter Anna married to Peter Custard. Jacob Godshalk's will was written 26 December 1760 and proved 3 June 1763.\n\n\n"}

McCallum played college football for the U.S. Naval Academy, and then played professionally for the Los Angeles Raiders of the NFL. He is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nMcCallum was born in Jefferson City, Missouri. The son of two teachers, he grew up in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio before the family moved to the suburb of Milford, Ohio. He attended Milford High School. As a senior for the Eagles, McCallum played both running back and defensive back. As a senior, he rushed for 1,625 yards, scored 17 touchdowns and intercepted 12 passes. He was named third-team All-Ohio defensive back, all-Southwest Ohio and all-city.\n\nMcCallum had offers to play for major football powers including Syracuse, Tennessee and North Carolina State, but they all wanted him as a defensive back and not as a running back. He committed to attend the U.S. Naval Academy where he played football and was the star tailback, punt returner and kick returner. In the second game of his senior year, he suffered a season-ending injury to his ankle. McCallum was granted an additional season eligibility by the NCAA and the Naval Academy.\n\nDuring his time at Navy, he was a two-time consensus All-American and set an NCAA record with 7,172 career all-purpose yards. He was also the career rushing leader at Navy with 4,179 yards until that record was broken by Keenan Reynolds in 2015. He was a member of the Navy Midshipmen football team that played in the Army-Navy game at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California in 1983. He scored two touchdowns in Navy's 48–13 victory.\n\nMcCallum was a computer science major at the Naval Academy and as of 1986 held 16 football records there. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\nAfter graduating in December 1985, McCallum stayed at the academy as a recruiter. In May, McCallum was selected in the 1986 USFL Draft by the Baltimore Stars in the third round after a trade in the previous year with the San Antonio Gunslingers. In 1986 the Navy assigned him to , home ported in Long Beach, California, near Los Angeles, as a supply officer. McCallum played for the Los Angeles Raiders while on active duty that year; the military does not prohibit outside employment that does not interfere with service. He rushed for his season-high NFL totals with 536 yards while splitting playing time with incumbent Marcus Allen.\n\nThe Navy assigned McCallum in 1987 to , home ported in Alameda, California and at that time sailing in the Indian Ocean, preventing him from returning to the NFL; McCallum believed that the Navy did so because of the attention he received from playing for the Raiders. After serving his duty with the Navy until 1990, McCallum rejoined the Raiders. His playing time was limited as he played special teams and as a short-yardage specialty back, as Marcus Allen was the more dominant running back at the time. In the 1993 playoffs, he rushed for 3 touchdowns in a wild-card victory over the Denver Broncos.\n\nOn September 5, 1994, during a \"Monday Night Football\" contest and the Raiders' opening game of the season at the San Francisco 49ers, McCallum's career ended prematurely when 49ers linebacker Ken Norton Jr. twisted him to the ground. As Norton and McCallum went down, McCallum's left cleat stuck in the ground, forcing his knee into a horrible dislocation. Norton lay pinned underneath a motionless McCallum for a couple of minutes while athletic trainers attended to McCallum.\n\nMcCallum suffered a complete hyperextension of his left knee, almost to a right angle. He suffered a ruptured artery in his left knee, and tore three ligaments, tore the calf and hamstring from the bone, and suffered nerve damage in the knee. He initially thought he'd only face a lengthy rehab, but McCallum's surgeon told him that there was no chance of his ever being medically cleared to play again. The surgeon said that he normally didn't see leg injuries this severe except in car accidents. Had the subsequent surgery not gone as planned, there was a chance his left leg would have been amputated.\n\nMcCallum moved to Henderson, Nevada in 1996 and started a computer graphics business, Pro Digital Graphics. He is also an avid golfer. He later sold the business and is currently director of community development for the Las Vegas Sands Corp. He and his wife Yvonne have four daughters.\n\nMcCallum played a significant role in the Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas by setting up a meeting in 2015 between Raiders owner Mark Davis and various officials in Las Vegas after approaching Davis about moving the team to Las Vegas before a Broncos-Raiders game on November 9, 2014 in Oakland. McCallum was the first to suggest meeting with UNLV about the idea. Previously, Las Vegas officials, notably Mayor Carolyn Goodman, had suggested building a stadium near Las Vegas Motor Speedway. He later set up a meeting between Davis and his boss at Las Vegas Sands Sheldon Adelson who would later help Davis secure the public money needed to build Allegiant Stadium.\n"}
{"id": "2207013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207013", "title": "Laurie Island", "text": "Laurie Island\n\nLaurie Island is the second largest of the South Orkney Islands. The island is claimed by both Argentina as part of Argentine Antarctica, and the United Kingdom as part of the British Antarctic Territory. However, under the Antarctic Treaty System all sovereignty claims are frozen, as the island lies south of the parallel 60°. Buchanan Point at the north-eastern end of the island, with Cape Whitson on its south coast, are Important Bird Areas.\n\nLaurie Island was discovered by Captains George Powell and Nathaniel Palmer in the course of their 1821 expedition to the South Atlantic. Richard Holmes Laurie used Powell's observations to create a map of the island, and subsequently, the island was named after him. Two years later, James Weddell mapped the island for the second time, though his charts turned out to be much less accurate than Powell's charts. Weddell attempted to rename the island to Melville Island for the 2nd Viscount Melville, but the name failed to stick when the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition opted for Laurie Island instead.\n\nWilliam S. Bruce conducted the first comprehensive scientific study of Laurie Island during the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition. Aboard his ship, the \"Scotia\", Bruce landed on Laurie Island in March 1903. The first settlement, Omond House, was built by the crew out of stone, and would be used both as a shelter and as a post from which to study the weather.\nIn January 1904, Bruce offered control of Omond House to the government of Argentina; the house would later be renamed Orcadas Base. The British Government had previously refused to carry on the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition's scientific studies, as they considered Laurie Island itself worthless. The expedition lacked the necessary mandate to claim the island for either Britain or Scotland. Nevertheless, Bruce's offer was accepted, and the Argentines would continue operating the meteorological station at Omond House, sending a ship each year to replenish supplies. Laurie Island would prove politically valuable to Argentina. To justify its claim to a sector of Antarctica, Argentina argued that its permanent settlement on the island demonstrated sovereignty, a key to securing a claim over a mostly desolate area. Robert Rudmose-Brown, who participated in Bruce's expedition, expressed a different view. He argued in a 1947 article that no country had the capability to govern a region as vast as Antarctica and thus no country had the standing to claim Antarctica as its own.\n\nBy 1908, Britain had come to regret its previous assessment of Laurie Island. In the Letters Patent of 1908, Britain declared a claim over the South Orkney Islands and incorporated Laurie Island into the newly created Falkland Islands Dependencies, meaning that Laurie Island would be subject to the British government in the Falklands. Argentina did not lodge a formal protest against the Letters Patent and Britain interpreted this as an acceptance of the British claim. The British position was that Bruce had given the meteorological station, but not the island itself to Argentina. The territorial dispute escalated in 1925 with the construction of an Argentinian wireless telegraph station on the island. As Argentina viewed Laurie Island as its own, the Argentine government did not request permission from the British government to operate the station, and for the first time, Argentina made an outright declaration that it had sovereignty over the island. Britain saw the possibility of strategically relinquishing the South Orkney Islands to Argentina in order to strengthen diplomatic relations or to secure the Falkland Islands themselves. The Argentine occupation of Laurie Island posed a problem for this strategy, as it weakened Britain's claim to the South Orkneys. Before a British cession of the South Orkney Islands could exert any leverage, Britain would have to solidify its own claim over the territory.\n\nLaurie Island is also the site of the first post office built in the Antarctic. After William S. Bruce turned over the meteorological station to the Argentinian government, Argentina initiated postal services on 20 February 1904. The post office went inactive shortly after, until 1942, when Argentina restarted postal services, in part to assert its claim to the South Orkney Islands. In response, the British government refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the post office. When the auxiliary cruiser HMS \"Carnarvon Castle\" visited Laurie Island, the Secretary of State for the Colonies cautioned the crew against sending letters while on shore, as doing so would undercut the British position that Argentina had no authority to establish a post office on Laurie Island in the first place.\n\nSedimentary rocks, most notably the Greywacke-Shale Formation, constitute the bulk of Laurie Island. Dr. John H. Harvey Pirie, a geologist aboard the \"Scotia\" described the rock as \"a fine-grained greywacke of a blue-grey or greenish-grey colour.\" The greywacke contained grains of many different minerals, quartz being the most numerous, along with plagioclase feldspar, titanite, zircon, biotite, chlorite, and veins of calcite. Pirie also found shale formations distributed across the island, usually fractured and twisted. Graptolite Island, off of Laurie Island's south-east coast, particularly exhibited these shale formations. It was on Graptolite Island that Pirie collected three fossils which he later mistook to be the remains of ancient animal organisms known as graptolites, hence the name of the island. Gertrude Elles believed that \"Pleurograptus\" was the specific species to which the graptolites belonged. Later analysis showed that the fossils on Graptolite Island were merely the remains of ancient plants.\n\nThe dating of the Greywacke-Shale Formation has proved to be a source of scientific controversy. Based on Pirie's incorrect analysis of the \"graptolites\", geologist I. Rafael Cordini dated the rock's genesis to the Ordovician Period. However, this explanation proved to be untenable, as Laurie Island would have been far older than had been thought possible. The reassessment of Pirie's fossils as plant remains dates the formation of the Greywacke to the Carboniferous Period, many millions of years later than originally thought.\n\n"}

{"id": "2207059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207059", "title": "Votivkirche, Vienna", "text": "Votivkirche, Vienna\n\nThe Votivkirche () is a neo-Gothic style church located on the Ringstraße in Vienna, Austria. Following the attempted assassination of Emperor Franz Joseph in 1853, the Emperor's brother Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian inaugurated a campaign to create a church to thank God for saving the Emperor's life. Funds for construction were solicited from throughout the Empire. The church was dedicated in 1879 on the silver anniversary of Emperor Franz Joseph and his wife Empress Elisabeth.\n\nThe origin of the Votivkirche derives from a failed assassination attempt on Emperor Franz Joseph by Hungarian nationalist János Libényi on 18 February 1853. During that time, when the Emperor was in residence at the Hofburg Palace, he took regular walks around the old fortifications for exercise in the afternoons. During one such stroll, while walking along one of the outer bastions with one of his officers, Count Maximilian Karl Lamoral O'Donnell von Tyrconnell, the twenty-one-year-old tailor's apprentice attacked the twenty-three-year-old Emperor from behind, stabbing him in the collar with a long knife. The blow was deflected by the heavy golden covering embroidered on the Emperor's stiff collar. Although his life was spared, the attack left him bleeding from a deep wound.\n\nA civilian passer-by, Dr. Joseph Ettenreich, came to the Emperor's assistance, and Count O'Donnell struck Libényi down with his sabre, holding him until the police guards arrived to take him into custody. As he was being led away, the failed assassin yelled in Magyar, \"Long live Kossuth!\" Franz Joseph insisted that his assailant not be mistreated. After Libényi's execution at Spinnerin am Kreuz in Favoriten for attempted regicide, the Emperor characteristically granted a small pension to the assassin's mother. \nDr. Ettenreich, who quickly overwhelmed the attacker, was later elevated to nobility by Franz Joseph for his bravery, and became Joseph von Ettenreich. Count O'Donnell, who up until then was a count in the German nobility by virtue of his great-grandfather, was afterwards made a Count of the Habsburg Empire and received the Commander's Cross of the Royal Order of Leopold. His customary O'Donnell arms were augmented by the initials and shield of the ducal House of Austria and also the double-headed eagle of the Empire. These arms are emblazoned on the portico of No. 2 Mirabel Platz in Salzburg, where O'Donnell later built his residence.\n\nAfter the unsuccessful assassination attempt, the Emperor's brother, Maximilian — later Emperor of Mexico — called upon communities throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire for donations to a new church on the site of the attack. The church was to be a votive offering for the rescue of Franz Joseph and \"a monument of patriotism and of devotion of the people to the Imperial House.\"\n\nThe church plans were established in an architectural competition in April 1854. 75 projects from the Austrian Empire, German lands, England, and France were submitted. Originally, the plans were to include the neighbouring \"Allgemeines Krankenhaus\" and create a campus fashioned after the plans of Oxford and Cambridge University.\n\nAnother plan was to create a national cathedral for all the people of the empire. However, because of spiraling costs and the changing political situation, this plan had to be downsized. The jury choose the project of Heinrich von Ferstel (1828–1883), who, at the time, was only 26. He chose to build the cathedral in the neo-Gothic style, borrowing heavily from the architecture of Gothic French cathedrals. Because of this concept, many people mistake this church for an original Gothic church. However, the Votivkirche is not a servile imitation of a French Gothic cathedral, but rather embodies a new and individual design concept. Furthermore, the Votivkirche was built with one single architect exercising supervision over its entire construction, and not by several generations, as were the cathedrals in the Middle Ages.\nConstruction began in 1856, and it was dedicated twenty-six years later on April 24, 1879, the occasion of the silver jubilee of the royal couple.\n\nThe church was one of the first buildings to be built on the Ringstraße. Since the city walls still existed at that point, the church had no natural parishioners. At that time it was meant as a garrison church, serving the many soldiers that had come to Vienna in the wake of 1848 Revolution.\nThe church is not located directly on the boulevard but along a broad square (now the Sigmund Freud Park) in front of it. The \"Votivkirche\" is made out of white sandstone, similar to the Stephansdom, and therefore has to be constantly renovated and protected from air-pollution and acid rain, which tends to colour and erode the soft stone.\n\nThe church has undergone extensive renovations after being badly damaged during World War II.\n\nSince its architectural style is quite similar to the Stephansdom, it often gets mistaken for it by tourists, in part because both churches have patterned tiling on their roofs. In reality the two churches differ in age by more than 700 years.\n\nThe design of this church has been closely imitated in the Gedächtniskirche in Speyer, Germany, the Cathedral of St. Helena in Helena, Montana, USA, and the Sint-Petrus-en-Pauluskerk in Oostende, Belgium.\n\nThe Votivkirche has the typical form of a Gothic cathedral :\n\nThe interior consists of a nave and two aisles, crossed by a transept. This transept has the same height as the nave, while the aisles are only half as high and half as wide as the nave. The side chapels in the transept are as high and wide as the aisles. The choir is surrounded by an ambulatory with apsidioles and a Lady chapel.\n\nThis imposing church constitutes a harmonious whole through the proportions, arrangement, spaciousness and unity of style of all the elements.\n\nThe Emperor window, donated by the City of Vienna, depicted the delivrance of the Emperor, saved from assassination by Maximilian Graf O'Donnell von Tyrconnell, but this original theme was lost when the windows were destroyed during World War II. The replacement window was restored by the City of Vienna in 1964, albeit modified to reflect the changing times. The detail of the actual moment of the Emperor's deliverance was lost, and although otherwise faithful to the original design, the replacement took on a less monarchical and more religious tone.\n\nThis impressive altar catches the eye with its gilded retable and an elaborate ciborium over it. The artist Joseph Glasser drew his inspiration for the ciborium from examples in Italian Gothic churches, such as the Basilica of St. John Lateran and the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, both in Rome.\n\nThe marble altar is decorated with panels with glass mosaic inlays work. and is supported by six alabaster columns.\n\nA gilded retable stands above the altar, at the bottom of which is the tabernacle, flanked by enameled panels depicting two scenes from the Old Testament: the Sacrifice of Isaac and the dream of Joseph. Above the tabernacle is a niche with a crucifix. Niches surrounding the tabernacle contain statues of angels and various saints. These are: on the left side, statues of the patron saints of the church, Charles Borromeo, and of the founder, Maximilian of Lorch; on the right side, Hilary of Poitiers and Bernard of Clairvaux.\n\nThe ciborium is supported by four massive red granite columns. It opens up into four pointed arches, crowned with gables and flanked by pinnacles with statues of saints in their niches. The cross vault is painted with allegorical representations of the four cardinal virtues, while the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, is portrayed on the boss. In the spandrel on the front, one can see a mosaic of the Blessed Virgin Mary in her title as the Immaculate Conception, trampling on a snake. This was a gift of Pope Pius IX. In the spire at the top of the ciborium, stands Christ surrounded by four angels.\n\nThe four side chapels in the transept are as high and wide as the aisles : the Rosary chapel, the Chapel of the Cross, the Bishops’ chapel and the baptistry. They form side aisles in the transept, giving the strange impression that the transept is composed of three aisles. Each of these four transept chapels display on their wall pillars four statues of saints. The famous polychrome Antwerp altar in Late-Gothic style (ca. 1530) was in the Rosary chapel till 1986, but is now located in the Museum. The Renaissance sarcophagus of Nicholas, Graf von Salm (defender of Vienna during the Turkish siege in 1529) stands in the baptistry. It was set up as a token of gratitude by emperor Ferdinand I.\n\nThe hexagonal Neo-Gothic pulpit stands on six marble pillars. The front panels show us in the middle a preaching Christ, flanked on both sides by the Church Fathers: Saint Augustine, Saint Gregory, Saint Jerome, and Saint Ambrose. These half-reliefs are framed inside sunken medaillons with a gilded mosaic background. Four pillars support the wooden soundboard and on top a spire with a statue of John the Baptist.

{"id": "2207084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207084", "title": "Byrdmaniax", "text": "Byrdmaniax\n\nByrdmaniax is the tenth album by the American rock band the Byrds. It was released in June 1971 on Columbia Records (\"see\" 1971 in music) at a time of renewed commercial and critical success for the band, due to the positive reception that their two previous albums, \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" and \"(Untitled)\", had received. The album was the second by the Byrds to feature the Roger McGuinn, Clarence White, Gene Parsons, and Skip Battin line-up of the band and was mostly recorded in early 1971, while the band were in the midst of an exhausting tour schedule. As a result, the band had little time to hone their new songs before recording commenced and thus, much of the material on the album is underdeveloped. \"Byrdmaniax\" was poorly received upon release, particularly in the United States, and did much to undermine the Byrds' new-found popularity.\n\nThe album peaked at #46 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart but failed to reach the UK Albums Chart. The song \"I Trust (Everything Is Gonna Work Out Alright)\" was released as a preceding single on May 7, 1971 in the United Kingdom but it did not chart. A second single taken from the album, \"Glory, Glory\", was released on August 20, 1971 and reached #110 on the \"Billboard\" chart, but again, the single failed to reach the UK chart. \"Byrdmaniax\" remains one of the Byrds most poorly received album releases, largely due to the incongruous addition of strings, horns, and a gospel choir which were overdubbed onto the songs by producer Terry Melcher and arranger Paul Polena, reportedly without the band's consent.\n\nAfter the release of the Byrds' \"(Untitled)\" album, the band continued to tour extensively throughout late 1970 and early 1971 in support of the record. With the band's career experiencing a revival of commercial fortunes, the Byrds elected to continue working with Terry Melcher, who had produced the band's two previous albums. Unfortunately, the grueling pace of the band's touring schedule meant that they were under-prepared for the recording of their next album, with little or no time to develop the material that they intended to include. Sessions for \"Byrdmaniax\" commenced on October 6, 1970, just three weeks after the release of \"(Untitled)\", and continued throughout January and March 1971, with the band recording twelve new songs as well as revisiting an outtake from the \"(Untitled)\" sessions, \"Kathleen's Song\". The album's pre-release working title was \"Expensive\", a tongue-in-cheek reference to the bloated costs incurred during the recording of the album, but ultimately this was dropped in favor of the less opulent sounding \"Byrdmaniax\".\n\nAmong guitarist Roger McGuinn's songwriting contributions to the album was the modal acoustic ballad \"Pale Blue\" (co-written with drummer Gene Parsons). The song's title can be seen as a metaphor for a mood, while its romantic lyrics deal with the conflicting themes of freedom and security. With its melancholy sense of longing, folksy instrumentation, and sensitive lead vocal performance, \"Pale Blue\" is often regarded by critics as being one of the most successful musical statements on the album as well as something of a lost classic among the Byrds' oeuvre. Another McGuinn-penned song included on \"Byrdmaniax\" was the commercially unsuccessful, quasi-gospel single \"I Trust\" (re-titled as \"I Trust (Everything Is Gonna Work Out Alright)\" for the single release). The song's title and lyrical refrain was inspired by McGuinn's personal catchphrase, \"I trust everything will turn out alright\", which itself had been borrowed by the guitarist during the mid-1960s from the best-selling book \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" by Norman Vincent Peale.\n\nMcGuinn's other compositional contributions to \"Byrdmaniax\" were two songs that he had written with lyricist Jacques Levy for the pair's aborted Broadway musical, \"Gene Tryp\". Of these, \"Kathleen's Song\" had originally been intended for a scene in which the song's eponymous heroine patiently waits for Gene Tryp, her lover, to return home from his travels. \"Kathleen's Song\" had, in fact, been recorded in June 1970 during the recording sessions for \"(Untitled)\" but had been omitted from that album at the eleventh hour, due to a lack of space. As a result, there are promo copies of \"(Untitled)\" known to exist that list the song (under the abbreviated title \"Kathleen\") on the album sleeve. The Byrds returned to \"Kathleen's Song\" in January and March 1971, undertaking additional recording work in order to ready the track for release on \"Byrdmaniax\". The second \"Gene Tryp\" song included on the album was \"I Wanna Grow Up to Be a Politician\", a whimsical ragtime pastiche that had been written for a scene in the musical in which the hero, Gene Tryp, runs as a presidential candidate. The song found a second lease of life away from the confines of \"Gene Tryp\", however, when its satirical lyrics found favor with America's radical youth, who were rebelling against the Nixon administration during the early 1970s.\n\n\"Byrdmaniax\" also included a pair of novelty songs penned by the band's bass player, Skip Battin, and his songwriting partner Kim Fowley. The first of these, \"Tunnel of Love\", was an organ driven Fats Domino pastiche, while the second, \"Citizen Kane\", served as a wry comment on Hollywood life and its celebrity legacy during the 1940s and 1950s. Unfortunately, the inclusion of these two songs, along with McGuinn and Levy's jaunty \"I Wanna Grow Up to Be a Politician\", caused the album to suffer from an overabundance of pastiche and whimsy. A third Battin–Fowley song, \"Absolute Happiness\", was more serious, with its dramatic lyrics providing a Buddhism-inspired meditation on positive values and the power of nature.\n\nThe album's opening track, \"Glory, Glory\", was borrowed by drummer Gene Parsons from the repertoire of The Art Reynolds Singers, just as \"Jesus Is Just Alright\" on \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" had been. Despite featuring a striking piano part and strong gospel backing vocals, the song lacked the immediacy of \"Jesus Is Just Alright\", as producer Terry Melcher admitted in a 1977 interview: \"We were aiming to cut another 'Jesus Is Just Alright', but we didn't make it. Larry Knechtel played piano on this cut but it was too fast. The whole thing was a mess.\" The album also included a bluegrass instrumental named \"Green Apple Quick Step\", written by Parsons and lead guitarist Clarence White, which featured guest musicians Eric White, Sr. (Clarence's father) on harmonica and Byron Berline on fiddle. White also brought the Helen Carter song \"My Destiny\" to the recording sessions, having first learned it during his days as a bluegrass musician. White elected to sing lead vocal on the track but unfortunately his nasal voice and the band's lackluster musical backing gave the recording a fatalistic and dirge-like quality. The final track on \"Byrdmaniax\" was a rendition of \"Jamaica Say You Will\", written by the then unknown Jackson Browne and featuring a Clarence White vocal performance that is widely regarded as one of his best on a Byrds' album.\n\nIn addition to the eleven songs included on the original LP, at least two outtakes from the album sessions are known to exist: a recording of Bob Dylan's \"Just Like a Woman\"—which had also been attempted during the \"(Untitled)\" recording sessions—and a cover of ex-Byrd Gene Clark's \"Think I'm Gonna Feel Better\". Both songs remained in the Columbia vaults for almost 29 years, before finally being released in 2000 as bonus tracks on the Columbia/Legacy reissue of \"Byrdmaniax\". The version of \"Just Like a Woman\" recorded for the album in 1971 represented the last Dylan song that the Byrds would record until \"Paths of Victory\", during the 1990 reunion sessions that were included on \"The Byrds\" box set. A third outtake from the album sessions that is rumored to exist is the Parsons–White composition \"Blue Grease\". This song was included in a pre-release track listing for the album that was published in the Byrds' fanclub newsletter, \"The Byrds Bulletin\", in early 1971. However, the track failed to appear on the album and may not have even been recorded by the band, since there is no mention of it in the Columbia files or in contemporary studio documentation.\n\nFollowing the completion of recording sessions for the album in early March 1971, the Byrds headed out on tour again, leaving Terry Melcher and engineer Chris Hinshaw to finish mixing the album. In the Byrds' absence, Melcher and Hinshaw brought in arranger Paul Polena to assist with the overdubbing of strings, horns, and a gospel choir onto many of the songs, at a reported cost of $100,000 and allegedly without the band's consent. When the band heard the extent of Melcher's additions they protested to Columbia Records, campaigning to have the album remixed and the orchestration removed but the record company held firm, citing budget restrictions, and the record was duly pressed up and released.\n\nFor his part, Melcher defended his actions by explaining that the band's performances in the studio were lackluster and that the orchestration was needed to cover up the album's musical shortcomings. In a 1977 interview with the Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan, Melcher attempted to illustrate the situation in the recording studio during the making of the album and also explain his rationale for the orchestral additions: \"Several members of the group were involved in divorces and they were hiding from their wives. It was complete bedlam in the studio. Everyone had too many problems. There was a lack of interest on everybody's part. I was trying to save the album, but it was a mistake. I should have called a halt.\" Melcher also succinctly highlighted his lack of confidence in the quality of the material that the band had recorded: \"I think the orchestration was a big mistake, but the songs were weak.\" As for not obtaining the band's consent for the overdubs, Melcher explained \"I admit that I wasn't in consultation with them a lot and I didn't really deal with Clarence, Battin or Parsons on these matters. But I'm sure it was inconceivable that McGuinn did not know about the orchestration.\"\n\nThe band themselves were far from happy with the album and upon its release, were vocal in press interviews about their dissatisfaction. Even two years later, Clarence White complained to journalist Pete Frame that \"Terry Melcher put strings on while we were on the road, we came back and we didn't even recognize it as our own album.\" Gene Parsons disowned the album completely, describing it as \"Melcher's folly\" and commenting in interviews that the band were all appalled by what they heard when they returned from touring. McGuinn actually defended Melcher somewhat by indicating in an interview with the English journalist Keith Altham that the album had been taken away from the producer at the last minute and given to an engineer in San Francisco to remix. However, the production credits on the original LP sleeve do not support McGuinn's claim and Melcher later stated that he had no recollection of the album being mixed by anyone other than himself. In more recent years, McGuinn has conceded to journalist David Fricke that the album's shortcomings were not down to Melcher's over-production alone: \"We were just idling artistically, the album sounds like we really weren't concentrating on doing good work, good art.\"\n\n\"Byrdmaniax\" was released on June 23, 1971 in the United States (catalogue item KC 30640) and August 6, 1971 in the United Kingdom (catalogue item S 64389). Although the album was issued in stereo commercially, there is some evidence to suggest that mono copies of the album (possibly radio station promos) were distributed in the UK. As well as being issued in the standard stereo format, \"Byrdmaniax\" was also released in 1971 as a Quadraphonic LP in Japan on the CBS Sony label (catalogue item SOPL-34001). The quadraphonic version of the album features a noticeably different mix to the standard stereo version.\n\nThe album peaked at #46 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart, during a chart stay of ten weeks, but failed to chart in the UK. A single, \"I Trust (Everything Is Gonna Work Out Alright)\" b/w \"(Is This) My Destiny\", was released ahead of the album on May 7, 1971 in the UK, to coincide with a European tour, but it did not chart. A second single taken from the album, \"Glory, Glory\" (b/w \"Citizen Kane\"), was released on August 20, 1971 and reached #110 on the \"Billboard\" chart but again failed to chart in the UK. The striking album cover artwork, featuring a set of silver \"death masks\"—one for each member of the band—was designed by Virginia Team and Grammy Award-winning Columbia Records' art director, John Berg. These foreboding plaster facemasks, which were created by artist Mary Leonard and photographed by Don Jim, have been regarded by some critics as an accurate visual representation of the lifeless music on the album and the declining state of the band in 1971.\n\nUpon its release, \"Byrdmaniax\" was greeted positively by the UK music press but received scathing reviews in the U.S. Richard Meltzer's review in the August 1971 edition of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine was particularly vicious, with Meltzer describing the album as \"increments of pus\". The same review also described the McGuinn–Levy composition \"I Wanna Grow Up to Be a Politician\" as a song that was \"degenerating into namby pamby innocuous mickey mouse with latent-blatant political content\". Meltzer concluded his withering attack by deriding the Byrds themselves as \"a boring dead group.\" In the UK, Roy Hollingworth's review in the August 14, 1971 edition of \"Melody Maker\" was more positive and described the album as \"one sweet length of bursting Byrds sunshine, so perfect in quality and quantity you'd feel an absolute heel to ask for more.\" \"Record Mirror\" was also enthusiastic in its praise of the album, describing it as \"another fine album by the Byrds.\" However, not all British reviews of \"Byrdmaniax\" were positive, with Richard Green of the \"NME\" noting that \"When the true history of rock comes to be written, the Byrds will get a deserved place of honour on the strength of tunes like 'Mr. Tambourine Man', 'Eight Miles High', and 'So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star'. Hopefully the writer will not have listened to \"Byrdmaniax\" or he may drastically alter his opinion.\" Green was also critical of Terry Melcher's use of strings and horns on many of the tracks, concluding that \"Orchestration is all very well for some bands, but not, on this showing, for the Byrds.\"\n\nToday, \"Byrdmaniax\" is generally regarded as the Byrds' weakest album, as well as the least popular of any of the band's releases amongst their fanbase. Mark Deming, writing for the Allmusic website, has summed up the album by concluding \"Not an awful album, but Byrdmaniax is hardly the pleasure it could have been in the hands of a more tasteful production team.\" In his 2000 review for \"The Austin Chronicle\", Raoul Hernandez gave the album a rating of three stars out of five, commenting \"\"Byrdmaniax\" may be as disjointed as reviews claimed at the time, but most of these same critics didn't like \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\" either, and if the Gram Parsons-blessed classic is ground zero for 'country rock' then \"Maniax\" is full-blown 'gospel rock'.\" \"Rolling Stone\" senior editor David Fricke remarked in 2000 that \"Byrdmaniax\" suffered not just from Melcher's inappropriate orchestration, but also from being a Byrds' album that is almost totally bereft of the Byrds' signature sound. According to Fricke, the familiar chime of McGuinn's 12-string Rickenbacker guitar is lost beneath the overbearing strings and the band's trademark harmonies are also largely absent from the album.\n\n\"Byrdmaniax\" was remastered at 20-bit resolution as part of the Columbia/Legacy Byrds series. It was reissued in an expanded form on February 22, 2000 with three bonus tracks. These bonus tracks included an outtake version of Gene Clark's \"Think I'm Gonna Feel Better\", sung by Clarence White (who had also played guitar on Clark's original 1967 solo recording of the song); a stripped-down alternate version of \"Pale Blue\"; and a rendition of Bob Dylan's \"Just Like a Woman\". The remastered reissue also includes, as a hidden track, an alternate version of \"Green Apple Quick Step\", which is sometimes known by the alternate title \"Byrdgrass\".\n\"Byrdmaniax\" was again reissued in Japan in the Blu-Spec High Definition audio format on February 14, 2014. Bonus tracks Include the Mono promotional single version of 'Glory, Glory', a live version of 'I Trust', the previously released bonus tracks of 'Think I'm Gonna Feel better' and 'Just Like A Woman', and a newly uncovered studio song 'Nothin' To it'. The disc comes in a cd-sized gatefold paper sleeve album replica (Mini LP) with obi strip and booklet insert of notes (mostly in Japanese). \nActual track durations are given in the booklet insert.\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bruno was probably from an aristocratic background. He was a Saxon monk belonging to the household of Archbishop Werner, of Magdeburg, who was a vigorous opponent of Henry IV and one of the leaders of the Saxon uprising against the emperor. After the death of the archbishop in 1078 at the hands of peasants, Bruno attached himself to Werner of Wolkenburg, Prince-Bishop of Merseburg, to whom, in 1082, he dedicated the work, \"De Bello Saxonico\" by which he is chiefly known. As its name indicates, it is a record of the struggles of the Saxons with the Emperor Henry IV. The author begins with an account of the youth of Henry and the evil influence exerted over him by Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg-Bremen after he had passed from the stern tutelage of Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne. He then traces the relations of the emperor with the Saxons and narrates at length the causes and events of the Saxon Rebellion, ending with the election of Hermann of Luxemburg as king in 1081.\n\nBruno sought to justify the rebellion of the Saxons and the election of the first anti-king, Rudolf, and to show how by his oppressive government King Henry had forfeited any right to rule, both for himself and his dynasty. Bruno also devoted considerable attention to Henry’s dispute with Pope Gregory VII, ten of whose letters he reproduced in his history. But while supporting the pope against the king, he made clear, both in his own words and through letters which he copied, that the German rebels were deeply disappointed by the Gregory’s absolution of Henry at Canossa in December 1076, and his attempt to remain neutral after the more intransigent rebels had elected a rival king at Forchheim in March 1077. Bruno was at pains to stress that this election was conducted with the full knowledge and involvement of a papal legate, and indeed followed the standards of probity laid down by canon law. Hence there could be no doubt about its validity.\nBruno described the dissatisfaction of the Saxons to the actions of Gregory VII. The German rebels reproached Gregory VII for not supporting the anti-king Rudolf. The letters to which they refer, which Bruno reproduced in full, were those sent by Gregory in the summer of 1077 to his legates, and to the clergy and people of Germany, setting out the terms by which a judgement might be made between the respective claims of Henry and Rudolf to be the rightful king.\n\nThere has been a difference of opinion regarding the historical value of Bruno's work. It was written during the contentions between Henry and Pope Gregory VII, and the author has been classed with those partisans who, either through ignorance or malice, endeavoured to lower Henry in the esteem of his subjects. Bruno indeed supported the pope's cause, and his Saxon sympathies manifest themselves at times in his writings, but of his sincerity and his expressed purpose to narrate the truth there can be no doubt. He made the most of his sources of information and, in spite of occasional omissions, gives a vivid picture of the times from the point of view of an interested contemporary. The letters of Saxon bishops and other original documents which he includes in his history give an added value to the work.\n\n\n"}

This nematode is one of the four commonest species worldwide and has numerous hosts. It typically incites large, usually irregular galls on roots as a result of parasitism.\n\n\"M. incognita\" can move along shallower temperature gradients (0.001C/cm) than any other known organism, an example of thermotaxis. The response is complicated and thought to allow the nematodes to move toward an appropriate level in soil, while they search for chemical cues that can guide them to specific roots.\n\n\"Meloidogyne incognita\" is widely spread around the globe and found in many different soil types.\n\n\"Meloidogyne incognita\" is probably the most economically important plant-parasitic nematode species among the tropical and subtropical regions. This nematode is extremely polyphagous, attacking both monocotyledons and dicotyledons. It is estimated that more than 3,000 plant species can be affected.\n\nPlants affected by \"M. incognita\" presents above ground symptoms of water and nutrient stress, yellowing, wilting, and stunting. Below ground galling on roots, bulbs, tubers is the typical symptom. Plant death may occur in high infestation level.\n\nFemales of \"M. incognita\" are pear-shaped with no posterior protuberance. Their stylet ranges from 15-16 µm long, and knobs are rounded and offset. Perineal pattern is oval to rounded, typically with high dorsal arch, striae usually wavy, and lateral field absent or weakly demarcated. Males have a not offset head with an elevated labial disc without lateral lips (usually). Their stylet ranges from 23-26 µm long, and knobs are rounded to oval and offset. Juveniles second stage body size range from 350-450 µm long. Their tail has rounded tip and range from 43-65 µm in length with 6-14 µm long hyaline region.\n\nWithin the egg, the first molt occurs and a juvenile first state (J1) becomes a juvenile second stage (J2). Under favorable conditions (temperature, moisture, host stimulus) the J2 hatches, reaches and penetrates the host root. Root tips are the primary infection court. Once inside the roots, J2 migrate through cortical tissues towards the vascular zone where they establish a permanent feeding site called giant cell. At this point the nematode enlarges acquire a “sausage” shape and becomes sedentary. Three more molts occur, J2 becomes J3, J4 and then adult. \"M. incognita\" is sexually dimorphic. Females acquire a globose shaped body while males become vermiform and leave the roots. Upon maturity females lay eggs into a gelatinous mass that protect them against unfavorable environmental conditions, and the life cycle is repeated. It takes 37 days at 21 degree Celsius for \"M. incognita\" to complete its life cycle.\n\nManagement of \"M. incognita\" depends primarily on the crop being affected and relies on multiple strategies such as cultural, biological and chemical control. Among the cultural control crop rotation with nonhost or resistant varieties can be used to keep the nematode population at tolerable levels. Also, usage of organic amendments and antagonistic crops such as \"Crotalaria spectabilis\" is effective against this nematode. Some fungus that parasites eggs, for example \"Paecilomyces lilacinus\", have been using as a biological control. There are several nematicides out in the market for controlling \"M. incognita\"\".\" \n\n\n\n"}

In 2008, Dr. Emmett Brown was selected by \"Empire\" magazine as one of \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time\", ranking at #20.\n\nDr. Emmett L. Brown refers to himself as \"a student of all sciences\" and is depicted as a talented inventor. His homes in 1985, 1955, and 1885 are shown to contain various labor-saving gadgets.\n\nHe appears to be heavily influenced by scientists of previous eras, naming successive pet dogs Copernicus and Einstein, and having portraits of Isaac Newton, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein in his laboratory. His favorite author is Jules Verne and his family name was originally \"von Braun\" before World War I.\n\nEmmett's family moved to Hill Valley from Germany in 1908. Although initially wealthy because of his inheritance, he spent his entire family fortune on his time travel project. When the Brown mansion was destroyed by fire in 1962 and the property sold to developers, Doc subsequently resided in the mansion's garage. Once broke, he established a privately owned business to offer 24-hour scientific services, building ingenious devices for his customers.\n\nEmmett's work appears to be highly regarded, enough for him to win an award for his work. However, he is shown as absent-minded at times, and various statements by other characters inhabiting Hill Valley indicate that he is generally regarded as strange, eccentric, or insane. Being very loud and sprightly, he often speaks with wide-eyed expressions and broad gestures (\"Great Scott!\" being one of his well-known catchphrases) and tends to be overly verbose in his delivery, referring in one case to a school dance as a \"rhythmic ceremonial ritual\".\n\nDoc and Marty met several years prior to the events of the first time travel experiment when Marty, out of curiosity, sneaked into Doc's lab after being warned by his parents to stay away from him. Happy to be revered as 'cool', Doc hired Marty as his part-time lab assistant.\n\nIn the original timeline, in contrast with Marty's shy and unassertive father, George McFly, Doc is a supportive and open-minded mentor for Marty. Doc's positive influence in turn allows Marty to mentor George in 1955, which appears to encourage George's later success as a novelist, and help him become a better husband and father. One line in particular, \"If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything,\" originates from Doc. Marty repeats it to George in 1955, who repeats it back to Marty in the post time travel 1985.\n\nDoc has been involved with illegal and criminal enterprises (albeit as a means to obtain items for his inventions he could not purchase legally) but he is naive and care-free about the consequences of his actions. He excitedly tells Marty how he cheated Libyan terrorists out of stolen plutonium: \"They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and, in turn, gave them a shoddy bomb casing full of used pinball machine parts!\"\n\nDespite being intelligent and logical for the most part, Doc is somewhat naive at times about the unknown possible uses of his time machine, initially actively explores the course of the world's future and tries to alter the past or future of the principal characters to improve their lives. However, events lead him to conclude that time travel is too dangerous for humankind. His conviction initially strengthened when he realizes that he has unwittingly altered history by preventing the death of Clara Clayton in 1885; he concludes that the time machine has \"caused nothing but disaster\" and asks Marty to destroy it once he returns to his own time. Nonetheless, Doc pursues a romantic relationship with Clara despite the risks of further disrupting the timeline.\n\nHowever, after having been left behind in 1885 when Marty departs in the DeLorean for 1985, Doc starts a family with Clara; the couple have two sons, Jules and Verne. He eventually builds another time machine out of a steam locomotive, and the Browns return to 1985 in order to pick up Einstein before setting out for another adventure.\n\n\nRick Sanchez of the American animated series \"Rick and Morty\" began as a parody of \"Doc\" Brown.\n\n"}

He was the head football coach at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1982 to 1994, where he compiled a record of 93–55–5 and won three consecutive Big Eight Conference titles between 1989 and 1991. McCartney's 1990 team was crowned as national champions by the Associated Press, splitting the title with the Georgia Tech team that topped the final Coaches' Poll rankings.\n\nIn September 2008, McCartney came out of a five-years retirement from Promise Keepers to become the CEO and chairman of the board of the organization after founding the Road to Jerusalem ministry. McCartney was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2013.\n\nAfter receiving his Bachelor of Arts in education from the University of Missouri in 1962, where he was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, McCartney was named as an assistant football coach under his older brother, Tom, in the summer of 1965 at Holy Redeemer High School in Detroit, Michigan. The younger McCartney was also the head basketball coach at Redeemer from 1965 to 1969, taking the school to the Detroit City Championship during the 1968–69 season. McCartney then served as the head football and basketball coach at Divine Child High School in Dearborn, Michigan before becoming the only high school coach ever hired by University of Michigan coaching legend Bo Schembechler.\n\nAfter eight years as an assistant at Michigan, McCartney was hired to replace Chuck Fairbanks as head coach at the University of Colorado on June 9, 1982. In his first season in 1982, the Colorado Buffaloes compiled a record of 2–8–1. After improving to 4–7 in 1983, Colorado sustained a 1–10 campaign in 1984, but McCartney was given a contract extension nonetheless. In his fourth season in 1985, McCartney guided the Buffaloes to a 7–5 record and a berth in the Freedom Bowl, where they lost to the Washington Huskies. In the following season, 1986, McCartney's team earned its first victory over Big Eight Conference powerhouse Nebraska since 1967. After modestly successful seasons in 1987 and 1988, McCartney steered his team toward national prominence.\n\nAfter the 1988 season, the Buffaloes' star quarterback Sal Aunese was diagnosed with stomach cancer. He died in the middle of the 1989 season. Nonetheless, Colorado won all 11 of its regular season games including victories over ranked Washington, Illinois, Nebraska, and Oklahoma teams. The Buffaloes faced Notre Dame on January 1, 1990 in the Orange Bowl, where they lost 21–6.\n\nColorado opened the 1990 season ranked fourth with a game against Tennessee in the inaugural Disney Pigskin Classic played in Anaheim, California. The contest ended in a 31–31 tie. A comeback win against Stanford and a one-point loss to Illinois leveled the Buffaloes' record at 1–1–1. Colorado then won the remainder of their regular season games. Their winning streak, highlighted by wins over ranked Washington, Oklahoma, and Nebraska opponents, was not without controversy. In a game against Missouri on October 6, referees mistakenly allowed an extra down on which Colorado scored the winning touchdown as time expired. The game, known as the Fifth Down Game, became one of the most notorious officiating gaffes in college football history. Contentions notwithstanding, Colorado rose to #1 in the rankings and once again faced Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl. The Buffaloes won a closely played game 10–9, aided by a controversial clipping call that negated a late punt return touchdown by Rocket Ismail of Notre Dame, and earned a share of the national title. Colorado was voted #1 by in AP Poll while Georgia Tech was voted the top ranking in the Coaches' Poll.\n\nThe following year, the Buffaloes tied Nebraska for the Big Eight title and lost to Alabama in the Blockbuster Bowl. In 1992, Colorado finished a 9–2–1 campaign with a loss to Syracuse in the Fiesta Bowl. In 1994, McCartney's final year, he coached the Buffaloes to a victory at Michigan, where McCartney had spent eight years as an assistant. Colorado won the game 27–26 on a 64-yard Hail Mary pass from Kordell Stewart to Michael Westbrook as time expired, which has since become known as The Miracle at Michigan. The Buffaloes posted an 11–1 record in 1994, capped by a win over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl. At the end of the 1994 season, McCartney retired from coaching at the age of 54.\n\nMcCartney holds records for the most games coached (153), most wins (93), and most conference wins (58) in the history of the Colorado Buffaloes football program.\n\nIn 1995, there was widespread media speculation that McCartney might un-retire to serve as the head coach at Michigan following the resignation of Gary Moeller.< McCartney, a former Wolverines assistant coach under Bo Schembechler, held a news conference to remove his name from consideration, stating that he wanted to devote his time to Promise Keepers.\n\nIn 1990, while still head football coach at Colorado, McCartney founded a Christian men's group called Promise Keepers. He later resigned as the head of Promise Keepers and founded an organization called The Road to Jerusalem. In September 2008, McCartney rejoined Promise Keepers as CEO and chairman of the board. He serves on the board of directors of the Equip Foundation, Gospel to the Unreached Millions, and Concerts of Prayer International. McCartney was on the forefront to support Amendment 2 to the Colorado Constitution, which denied the designation of homosexuals as a \"protected class\". His public appearance in the facilities of CU to support the Amendment caused an outcry among students of CU. The Amendment was found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\n\nMcCartney is the author of five books: \"From Ashes to Glory\" (1995), \"Sold Out\" (1997), \"Sold Out Two-Gether\" (1999), co-authored with his wife, Lyndi McCartney, \"Blind Spots: What You Don't See May Be Keeping Your Church From Greatness\" (2003), and \"Two Minute Warning: Why It's Time to Honor Jewish People Before the Clock Runs Out\" (2009) with Aaron Fruh.\n\nMcCartney won a number of national coaching awards in 1989 including the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year award, the Walter Camp Coach of the Year Award and the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award. Three times, in 1985, 1989, and 1990, he was named the Big Eight Coach of the Year. McCartney was inducted into the Orange Bowl Hall of Fame in 1996 and the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nMcCartney has been honored with a number of additional personal awards including: the Impact America Award from Point Loma College in 1995, the Spectrum Award from \"Sports Spectrum\" magazine in 1995, ABC News Person of the Week on February 16, 1996, Layperson of the Year from the National Association of Evangelicals in 1996, the Fire-Setters Award from Revival Fires Ministries in 1997, the Evangelist Philip Award from the National Association of United Methodist Evangelists in 1999, and the Humanitarian of the Year from the Syl Morgan Smith Colorado Gospel Music Academy in 1999.\n\nMcCartney lived with his late wife Lyndi in the Denver area. They have four children and ten grandchildren, one of whom (T.C. McCartney, a former LSU quarterback) was fathered by McCartney's former player Sal Aunese, who died of stomach cancer at the age of 21. The McCartneys attend Cornerstone Church in Boulder, Colorado.\n\n"}

He played college basketball for the Florida Gators before he was drafted 30th overall by the New York Knicks in the 2005 NBA draft. In the 2009-10 season, Lee received his first All-Star selection with the Knicks. In the 2010 offseason, Lee was signed and traded to the Golden State Warriors. With the Warriors, Lee received a second All-Star selection, became an All-NBA Team member, and won an NBA championship in 2015 in his fifth and final season with the team.\n\nAfter short stints with three other NBA teams and becoming a free agent in June 2017, Lee retired in November 2017.\n\nLee was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He went to middle school at John Burroughs School and high school at Chaminade College Preparatory School, both in St. Louis suburbs. Naturally left-handed, Lee became essentially ambidextrous when he broke his left arm and learned to play right-handed. Lee was a McDonald's All American and won the 2001 Slam Dunk competition. Lee was also named a first-team high school All-American by \"Parade\" magazine.\n\nLee accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Billy Donovan's Florida Gators basketball team from 2001 to 2005. As a freshman in 2002, he was named to the All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) freshman team by the conference's coaches. During his sophomore season in 2002–03, he averaged 11.5 points and 7 rebounds a game. Lee was named a second-team All-SEC selection in his junior in 2003–04, while averaging 13 points and 7 rebounds per game.\n\nLee's senior year, he was joined by incoming freshmen and future NBA players Al Horford, Corey Brewer, Taurean Green, and Joakim Noah. The Gators went on to win the 2005 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament—the Gators' first SEC Men's Basketball Tournament championship—by defeating the Kentucky Wildcats 70–53 in the tournament final.\n\nLee was selected by the Knicks with the team's second first-round pick (30th overall) in the 2005 NBA draft, following Channing Frye. Lee signed with the team on July 1, 2005.\nLee was installed as a starting forward for a stretch of 13 games in December 2005 and January 2006. Lee posted 23 points on 10–11 shooting, along with 15 rebounds and three steals in 52 minutes as the Knicks went on to defeat the Phoenix Suns in triple-overtime on January 2, 2006. Lee averaged 5.1 points (59.6%) and 4.5 rebounds per game in his rookie season while averaging 16.9 minutes of playing time in 67 games.\n\nWith an injury to Channing Frye, Lee started his first game of the season against the Chicago Bulls on November 28, 2006. On December 16, 2006, he was one of 10 players ejected in the Knicks–Nuggets brawl. However, he was not involved in the brawl and was not suspended by the NBA. On December 20, 2006 in a double-overtime game against the Charlotte Bobcats with 0.1 seconds left, Lee scored the winning basket by tipping in an inbounds pass. This was within the league's so-called Trent Tucker Rule, whereby a player cannot catch and shoot a successful field goal with less than three tenths of a second remaining on the clock. At the All-Star break, Lee had averaged 11.1 points on 61.05% shooting (first in the league), an 80.0% free throw percentage, 10.8 rebounds (8th in NBA) and 1.8 assists in 30.9 minutes a game. On February 16, 2007, Lee, playing for the Sophomores, was named the Most Valuable Player in the Rookie Challenge, finishing with 30 points on 14 of 14 shooting from the field and 11 rebounds. On February 23, 2007, in a game against the Milwaukee Bucks, Lee came down on future teammate Andrew Bogut's foot and sprained his ankle. The original diagnosis was for him to only miss a few days, but nearly three weeks after the injury he was still unable to play. He was reexamined and the doctor found that he had a much more severe sprain than was originally diagnosed. Lee played only sporadic minutes for the remaining games of the season.\n\nIn the 2007–08 season, Lee continued to develop into a major contributor off the bench for the Knicks.\n\nOn November 30, 2008 Lee set a career high in points, with 37, and became the first Knicks player with 30 points and 20 rebounds in a game since Patrick Ewing had 34 points and 25 rebounds on February 23, 1997.\n\nOn December 9, in a match-up against the Chicago Bulls, Lee became only the eleventh Knick ever to record 10 consecutive double-doubles.\n\nOn February 11, Lee was chosen to replace an injured Allen Iverson to represent the East team at the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. He became the first Knick to make the All-Star team since Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell appeared in the 2001 NBA All-Star Game. On April 2, Lee recorded the first triple-double of his career, putting up 37 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 assists against the Golden State Warriors. He became the first player since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1976 to record at least 35 points, 20 rebounds and 10 assists in a game. At the end of the season, Lee became an unrestricted free agent. He had recorded career highs in points per game, as well as assists per game.\n\nLee became an unrestricted free agent in the 2010 off-season. On July 9, he was signed and traded to the Golden State Warriors, who sent Anthony Randolph, Kelenna Azubuike, Ronny Turiaf, and a future second-round pick to the Knicks. Lee's contract under the deal paid him $79.54 million over six years, an average of $13.3 million per year.\n\nIn the 2010–11 season, Lee appeared in 73 games (all starts), averaging 16.5 points, 9.8 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.01 steals in 36.1 minutes per contest.\n\nOn February 7, 2012, Lee recorded his second triple-double, scoring 25 points and getting 11 rebounds, and 10 assists in a loss against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Over the course of the 2011–12 season, he averaged over 20 points per game, the second such season in his NBA career.\n\nOn January 24, 2013, Lee was named to the 2013 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve representing the Western Conference. He was the Warriors' first All-Star since Latrell Sprewell in 1997. Lee recorded a career-high 22 rebounds against the Spurs, and recorded his third-ever triple-double against the Charlotte Bobcats with 23 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists. Lee finished the season with averages of 18.5 points and 11.2 rebounds per game, and led the league in double-doubles with 56. Also, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team.\n\nLee injured his hip during the fourth quarter of his first playoff game. An MRI later revealed a \"complete tear of his right hip flexor\". Lee finished the game with 10 points and 14 rebounds. Despite the injury, which was expected to end his season, Lee returned for the sixth and final game of the series as the Warriors upset the Nuggets. However, the Warriors were defeated by the San Antonio Spurs in six games in the next round.\n\nOn February 2, 2014, Lee ended his double digit scoring streak at 123 games with 8 points in a 91–75 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nLee suffered a strained left hamstring in the final game of the preseason, which sidelined him for 24 out of the first 25 games of the season. Lee was replaced in the Warriors' starting lineup by Draymond Green, who continued to start even after Lee recovered. The highest-paid player on the Warriors roster at $15 million, Lee became a reserve for the first time since early in his career. On January 27, 2015, he scored a season-high 24 points in a 113–111 overtime loss to the Chicago Bulls. Lee won his first NBA championship with the Warriors after they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2015 NBA Finals in six games.\n\nOn July 27, 2015, Lee was traded to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb, as Golden State was seeking to offload his salary given his limited role on the team. He made his debut for the Celtics in the team's season-opener against the Philadelphia 76ers on October 28, recording 8 points and 5 rebounds as a starter in a 112–95 win. On February 19, 2016, he was waived by the Celtics.\n\nOn February 22, 2016, Lee signed with the Dallas Mavericks. He made his debut for the Mavericks two days later, recording four points and four rebounds off the bench in a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. In his second game for the Mavericks on February 26, he recorded 14 points and 14 rebounds in 25 minutes off the bench in a 122–116 overtime win over the Denver Nuggets. On March 25, Lee returned to Oracle Arena for the first time since being traded from the Warriors and got a standing ovation during a pre-game ceremony in which he received his 2015 championship ring. Lee missed the Mavericks' first two playoff games against the Oklahoma City Thunder due to a right foot injury.\n\nOn August 2, 2016, Lee signed with the San Antonio Spurs. He made his debut for the Spurs in their season opener on October 25, 2016, recording six points, six rebounds, and two assists in 11 minutes off the bench in a 129–100 win over his former team, the Golden State Warriors. On January 19, 2017, he grabbed a season-high 16 rebounds to go with 10 points in a 118–104 win over the Denver Nuggets. On March 1, 2017, he scored a season-high 18 points in a 100–99 win over the Indiana Pacers. A week later, on March 8, he tied his season high with another 18-point effort in a 114–104 win over the Sacramento Kings. On June 29, 2017, Lee was reported to have declined his player option, entering the free-agent market.\n\nOn November 19, 2017, Lee announced his retirement at age 34 via Instagram.\n\nIn 2007 Lee appeared on the game show \"Family Feud\", in an NBA Players vs Mothers week, to raise money for charity. On April 26, 2009, he appeared on NBC's \"Celebrity Apprentice\". Lee made a cameo in an episode of the now-canceled series \"Lipstick Jungle\", playing himself. He also made a cameo appearance in the 2009 movie \"When in Rome\". He also appeared in a segment of the 2009 version of TV series \"The Electric Company\".\n\nLee is a Christian. In 2009, Lee, along with several other NBA players, joined the Hoops for St. Jude charity program benefiting the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. \n\nLee married Danish-Polish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, in June 2019.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2207165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207165", "title": "Mahajanapadas", "text": "Mahajanapadas\n\nThe Mahājanapadas (, from \"maha\", \"great\", and \"janapada\" \"foothold of a people\") were sixteen kingdoms or oligarchic republics that existed in ancient India from the sixth to fourth centuries BCE. Two of them were most probably ganatantras (republics) and others had forms of monarchy. Ancient Buddhist texts like the \"Anguttara Nikaya\" make frequent reference to sixteen great kingdoms and republics which had evolved and flourished in a belt stretching from Gandhara in the northwest to Anga in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent and included parts of the trans-Vindhyan region, prior to the rise of Buddhism in India.\n\nThe 6th–5th century BCE is often regarded as a major turning point in early Indian history; it saw the emergence of India's first large cities after the demise of the Indus Valley Civilization, as well as the rise of sramana movements (including Buddhism and Jainism) which challenged the religious orthodoxy of the Vedic Period.\n\nArchaeologically, this period corresponds in part to the Northern Black Polished Ware culture.\n\nThe term \"Janapada\" literally means the \"foothold of a people\". The fact that \"Janapada\" is derived from \"Jana\" points to an early stage of land-taking by the Jana people for a settled way of life. This process of first settlement on land had completed its final stage prior to the times of the Buddha and Pāṇini. The Pre-Buddhist north-west region of the Indian sub-continent was divided into several Janapadas demarcated from each other by boundaries. In Pāṇini's \"Ashtadhyayi\", \"Janapada\" stands for country and \"Janapadin\" for its citizenry. Each of these Janapadas was named after the Kshatriya people (or the Kshatriya Jana) who had settled therein. Buddhist and other texts only incidentally refer to sixteen great nations (\"Solasa Mahajanapadas\") which were in existence before the time of the Buddha. They do not give any connected history except in the case of Magadha. The Buddhist Anguttara Nikaya, at several places, gives a list of sixteen great nations:\n\nAnother Buddhist text, the \"Digha Nikaya\", mentions only twelve Mahajanapadas from the above list and omits four of them (Assaka, Avanti, Gandhara, and Kamboja).\n\n\"Chulla-Niddesa\", another ancient text of the Buddhist canon, adds Kalinga to the list and substitutes Yona for Gandhara, thus listing the Kamboja and the Yona as the only Mahajanapadas from Uttarapatha.\n\nThe \"Vyākhyāprajñapti\" (or the \"Bhagavati Sutra\"), a sutra of Jainism, gives a different list of sixteen Mahajanapadas:\nThe author of the \"Bhagavati Sutra\" (or the \"Vyākhyāprajñapti\") has a focus on the countries of Madhydesa and of the far east and south only. He omits the nations from Uttarapatha like the Kamboja and Gandhara. The more extended horizon of the \"Bhagvati\" and the omission of all countries from Uttarapatha \"clearly shows that the Bhagvati list is of later origin and therefore less reliable.\"\n\nThe first reference to the Angas is found in the Atharva-Veda where they find mention along with the Magadhas, Gandharis and the Mujavats, apparently as a despised people. The Jaina Prajnapana ranks Angas and Vangas in the first group of Aryan people. It mentions the principal cities of ancient India. It was also a great center of trade and commerce and its merchants regularly sailed to distant Suwanabhumi. Anga was annexed by Magadha in the time of Bimbisara. This was the one and only conquest of Bimbisara.\n\nThe country of Assaka or the Ashmaka tribe was located in \"Dakshinapatha\" or southern India. It included areas in present-day Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. In Gautama Buddha's time, many of the Assakas were located on the banks of the Godavari River (south of the Vindhya mountains). The capital of the Assakas was Potana or Potali, which corresponds present-day Bodhan in Telangana and Paudanya of Mahabharata. The Ashmakas are also mentioned by Pāṇini. They are placed in the north-west in the \"Markendeya Purana\" and the \"Brhat Samhita\". The river Godavari separated the country of the Assakas from that of the Mulakas (or Alakas). The country of Assaka lay outside the pale of Madhyadesa. It was located on a southern high road, the \"Dakshinapatha\". At one time, Assaka included Mulaka and abutted Avanti.\n\nThe country of the Avantis was an important kingdom of western India and was one of the four great monarchies in India in the post era of Mahavira and Buddha, the other three being Kosala, Vatsa and Magadha. Avanti was divided into north and south by the river Narmada. Initially, Mahishamati (Mahissati) was the capital of Southern Avanti, and Ujjaini (Sanskrit: Ujjayini) was of northern Avanti, but at the times of Mahavira and Buddha, Ujjaini was the capital of integrated Avanti. The country of Avanti roughly corresponded to modern Malwa, Nimar and adjoining parts of today's Madhya Pradesh. Both Mahishmati and Ujjaini stood on the southern high road called \"Dakshinapatha\" which extended from Rajagriha to Pratishthana (modern Paithan). Avanti was an important centre of Buddhism and some of the leading \"theras\" and \"theris\" were born and resided there. King Nandivardhana of Avanti was defeated by king Shishunaga of Magadha. Avanti later became part of the Magadhan empire.\n\nThe Chedis, Chetis or Chetyas had two distinct settlements of which one was in the mountains of Nepal and the other in Bundelkhand near Kausambi. According to old authorities, Chedis lay near Yamuna midway between the kingdom of Kurus and Vatsas. In the mediaeval period, the southern frontiers of Chedi extended to the banks of the river Narmada. Sotthivatnagara, the Sukti or Suktimati of Mahabharata, was the capital of Chedi. The Chedis were an ancient people of India and are mentioned in the Rigveda, with their king Kashu Chaidya.\n\nThe location of the capital city, Suktimati, has not been established with certainty. Historian Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri and F. E. Pargiter believed that it was in the vicinity of Banda, Uttar Pradesh. Archaeologist Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti has proposed that Suktimati can be identified as the ruins of a large early historical city, at a place with the modern-day name Itaha, on the outskirts of Rewa, Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe wool of the Gandharis is referred to in the Rigveda. The Gandharas and their king figure prominently as strong allies of the Kurus against the Pandavas in the Mahabharata war. The Gandharas were furious people, well-trained in the art of war. According to Puranic traditions, this Janapada was founded by \"Gandhara\", son of Aruddha, a descendant of Yayati. The princes of this country are said to have come from the line of Druhyu who was a famous king of the Rigvedic period and one of the five sons of king Yayati of lunar dynasty. The river Indus watered the lands of Gandhara. Taksashila and Pushkalavati, the two cities of this Mahajanapada, are said to have been named after Taksa and Pushkara, the two sons of Bharata, a prince of [[Ayodhya]the younder brother of Lord Rama]. According to Vayu Purana (II.36.107), the Gandharas were destroyed by Pramiti (a.k.a. Kalika) at the end of Kaliyuga. Pāṇini mentioned both the Vedic form Gandhari as well as the later form Gandhara in his [[Ashtadhyayi]]. The Gandhara kingdom sometimes also included [[Kashmira]]. Hecataeus of Miletus (549-468) refers to Kaspapyros (Kasyapura or Purushapura, i.e., modern day Peshawar) as a [[Gandhara|Gandharic]] city. According to Gandhara Jataka, at one time, Gandhara formed a part of the kingdom of [[Kashmir]]. The Jataka also gives another name \"Chandahara\" for Gandhara.\n\nGandhara Mahajanapada of [[Buddhist]] traditions included territories of east [[Afghanistan]], and north-west of the Panjab (modern districts of [[Peshawar]] (Purushapura) and [[Rawalpindi]]). Its later capital was Taksashila (Prakrit for [[Taxila]]). The Taksashila University was a renowned centre of learning in ancient times, where scholars from all over the world came to seek higher education. Pāṇini, the Indian genius of grammar and [[Kautiliya]] are the world-renowned products of Taxila University. King Pukkusati or Pushkarasarin of Gandhara in the middle of the 6th century BCE was the contemporary of king [[Bimbisara]] of Magadha. Gandhara was located on the grand northern high road (Uttarapatha) and was a centre of international commercial activities. According to one group of scholars, the Gandharas and Kambojas were cognate people. It is also contended that the Kurus, Kambojas, Gandharas and Bahlikas were cognate people. According to Dr T. L. Shah, the Gandhara and Kamboja were nothing but two provinces of one empire and were located coterminously, hence influencing each other's language. Naturally, they may have once been a cognate people. Gandhara was often linked politically with the neighboring regions of [[Kashmir]] and [[Kambojas|Kamboja]].\n\nKambojas are also included in the Uttarapatha. In ancient literature, the Kamboja is variously associated with the [[Gandhara]], [[Darada]] and the [[Bactria|Bahlika]] ([[Bactria]]). Ancient Kamboja is known to have comprised regions on either side of the [[Hindukush]]. The original Kamboja was located in eastern [[Oxus]] country as neighbor to Bahlika, but with time, some [[clan]]s of the Kambojas appear to have crossed the Hindukush and planted colonies on its southern side also. These latter Kambojas are associated with the Daradas and Gandharas in Indian literature and also find mention in the [[Edicts]] of [[Ashoka]]. The evidence in the [[Mahabharata]] and in [[Ptolemy]]'s Geography distinctly supports two Kamboja settlements. The cis-Hindukush region from [[Nurestan]] up to [[Rajauri]] in southwest of [[Kashmir]] sharing borders with the [[Daradas]] and the [[Gandhara]]s constituted the \"Kamboja\" country. The capital of \"Kamboja\" was probably \"Rajapura\" (modern Rajori) in the south-west of Kashmir. The \"Kamboja Mahajanapada\" of the [[Buddhist]] traditions refers to this cis-Hindukush branch of ancient Kambojas.\n\nThe trans-Hindukush region including the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]] and [[Badakhshan]] which shared borders with the [[Bahlikas]] (Bactria) in the west and the Lohas and [[Rishikas]] of [[Sogdiana]]/[[Fergana]] in the north, constituted the [[Parama-Kamboja]] country. The trans-Hindukush branch of the Kambojas remained pure [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] but a large section of the Kambojas of cis-Hindukush appears to have come under Indian cultural influence. The Kambojas are known to have had both [[Iran]]ian as well as Indian affinities.\n\nThe Kambojas were also a well known republican people since [[Epic India|Epic]] times. The [[Mahabharata]] refers to several Ganah (or Republics) of the Kambojas. [[Kautiliya]]'s [[Arthashastra]] and [[Ashoka]]'s Edict No. XIII also attest that the Kambojas followed republican constitution. Pāṇini's Sutras, though tend to convey that the Kamboja of Pāṇini was a [[Kshatriya]] monarchy, but \"the special rule and the exceptional form of derivative\" he gives to denote the ruler of the Kambojas implies that the king of Kamboja was a titular head (\"king consul\") only. According to Buddhist texts, the first fourteen of the above Mahajanapadas belong to Majjhimadesa (\"Mid India\") while the last two belong to Uttarapatha or the \"north-west\" division of [[Jambudvipa]].\n\nIn a struggle for supremacy that followed in the 6th/5th century BCE, the growing state of the Magadhas emerged as the predominant power in ancient India, annexing several of the Janapadas of the Majjhimadesa. A bitter line in the [[Brahmin]] [[Purana]]s laments that Magadhan emperor [[Mahapadma Nanda]] exterminated all [[Kshatriya]]s, none worthy of the name Kshatriya being left thereafter. This obviously refers to the Kasis, Kosalas, Kurus, Panchalas, Vatsyas and other neo-Vedic tribes of the east Panjab of whom nothing was ever heard except in the legend and poetry. (The Nandas usurped the throne of [[Shishunaga dynasty]] c. 345 BCE, thus founding the [[Nanda Empire]].)\n\nThe Kambojans and Gandharans, however, never came into direct contact with the Magadhan state until [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]] and [[Kautiliya]] arose on the scene. But these nations also fell prey to the [[Achaemenid]]s of [[Persia]] during the reign of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] (558–530 BCE) or in the first year of [[Darius the Great|Darius]]. Kamboja and Gandhara formed the twentieth and richest satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire. Cyrus I is said to have destroyed the famous Kamboja city called Kapisi (modern [[Begram]]) in [[Paropamisade]].\n\nThe kingdom was located in the region around its capital [[Varanasi]], bounded by the Varuna and Asi rivers in the north and south which gave Varanasi its name. Before Buddha, Kasi was the most powerful of the sixteen Mahajanapadas. Several \"[[jataka tales]]\" bear witness to the superiority of its capital over other cities in India and speak highly of its prosperity and opulence. These stories tell of the long struggle for supremacy between Kashi and the three kingdoms of [[Kosala]], [[Anga]] and [[Magadha]]. Although King Brihadratha of Kashi conquered [[Kosala]], Kashi was later incorporated into [[Kosala]] by King Kansa during Buddha's time. The Kashis along with the Kosalas and Videhans find mention in Vedic texts and appear to have been a closely allied people. The \"[[Matsya Purana]]\" and \"Alberuni\" spell Kashi as \"Kausika\" and \"Kaushaka\" respectively. All other ancient texts read Kashi.\n\n[[File:Kosala Karshapana.jpg|thumb|Silver coins of [[Kosala]] mahajanapada (c. 525–465 BCE)]]\nThe country of Kosala was located to the north-west of Magadha, with its capital at [[Ayodhya]]. Its territory corresponded to the modern [[Awadh]] (or Oudh) in Central and Eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]]. It had the river [[Ganges River|Ganges]] for its southern, the river Gandak (Narayani) for its eastern, and the [[Himalaya]] mountains for its northern boundary. It finds mention as the center of Vedic Dharma. Its kings allied with the [[Devatas]] in various wars against the Daityas, Rakshas, and Asuras. Koshala and Ayodhya hold a central place in the Hindu scriptures, Itihas, and Purana. Raghuvansha-Ikshvakuvansha was the longest continuous dynasty; Lord Rama was a king in this dynasty. Other great kings were Prithu, Harishchandra, and Dilip, who are each mentioned in different Puranas, Ramayan, and Mahabharat. According to these texts, Koshala was the most powerful and biggest kingdom ever in the recorded history.\n\n[[File:Procession of Prasenajit of Kosala leaving Sravasti to meet the Buddha.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Procession of [[Prasenajit]] of Kosala leaving [[Sravasti]] to meet the [[Buddha]], [[Sanchi]].]]\nLater, the kingdom was ruled by the famous king Prasenajit during the era of Mahavira and Buddha, followed by his son Vidudabha ([[Virudhaka]]). King Prasenajit was highly educated. His position was further improved by a matrimonial alliance with Magadha: his sister was married to Bimbisara and part of Kasi was given as dowry. There was, however, a struggle for supremacy between king [[Pasenadi]] (Prasenajit) and king [[Ajatashatru]] of Magadha which was finally settled once the confederation of [[Licchavi (clan)|Lichchavis]] became aligned with Magadha. Kosala was ultimately merged into Magadha when Vidudabha was Kosala's ruler. [[Ayodhya]], [[Saketa]], [[Banaras]], and Sravasti were the chief cities of Kosala.\n\n[[File:Kurus (Kurukshetras) circa 350-315 BCE.jpg|thumb|Silver coin of [[Kuru (India)|Kuru]] mahajanapada (4th century BCE)]]\nThe [[Purana]]s trace the origin of Kurus from the \"[[Puru (Vedic tribe)|Puru]]-[[Bhāratas|Bharata]]\" family. Kuru was born after 25 generations of Puru's dynasty, and after 15 generations of Kuru, Kauravas and Pandavas were born. Aitareya Brahmana locates the Kurus in \"Madhyadesha\" and also refers to the Uttarakurus as living beyond the Himalayas. According to the Buddhist text Sumangavilasini, the people of Kururashtra (the Kurus) came from the Uttarakuru. Vayu Purana attests that \"Kuru\", son of Samvarsana of the Puru lineage, was the eponymous ancestor of the Kurus and the founder of Kururashtra (Kuru Janapada) in Kurukshetra. The country of the Kurus roughly corresponded to the modern [[Thanesar]], state of [[Delhi]], and [[Meerut]] district of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. According to the [[Jataka]]s, the capital of the Kurus was [[Indraprastha]] (Indapatta) near modern Delhi which extended seven leagues. At Buddha's time, the Kuru country was ruled by a titular chieftain (king consul) named Korayvya. The Kurus of the Buddhist period did not occupy the same position as they did in the [[Vedic period]] but they continued to enjoy their ancient reputation for deep wisdom and sound health. The Kurus had matrimonial relations with the [[Yadu|Yadavas]], the Bhojas, Trigratas, and the Panchalas. There is a [[Jataka]] reference to king Dhananjaya, introduced as a prince from the race of [[Yudhishtra]]. Though a well known monarchical people in the earlier period, the Kurus are known to have switched to a republican form of government during the 6th to 5th centuries BCE. In the 4th century BCE, [[Kautiliya]]'s [[Arthashastra]] also attests the Kurus following the \"Rajashabdopajivin\" (king consul) constitution.\n\n[[File:Magadha kingdom coin Circa 350 BC AR Karshapana.jpg|thumb|Silver coin of [[Magadha]] mahajanapada (c. 350 BCE)]]\nThe [[Magadha]] was one of the most prominent and prosperous of mahajanapadas. The capital city Pataliputra ([[Patna]], [[Bihar]]) was situated on the confluence of major rivers like the [[Ganga]], Son, Punpun and Gandak. The alluvial plains of this region and its proximity to the copper and iron rich areas of [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]] helped the kingdom to develop good quality weapons and support the agrarian economy. Its location at the centre of the highways of trade of those days contributed to its wealth. All these factors helped [[Magadha]] to emerge as the most prosperous state of that period.\n\n[[File:Bamboo garden (Venuvana) at Rajagriha, the visit of Bimbisara.jpg|thumb|left|King [[Bimbisara]] of Magadha visits the Bamboo Garden (Venuvana) in Rajagriha; artwork from [[Sanchi]].]]\nThe kingdom of the [[Magadha]]s roughly corresponded to the modern districts of [[Patna]] and [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] in southern [[Bihar]] and parts of [[Bengal]] in the east. The capital city of Pataliputra was bound in the north by the river Ganges, in the east by the river Champa, in the south by the [[Vindhya]] mountains and in the west by the river Sona. During Buddha's time its boundaries included Anga. Its earliest capital was Girivraja or Rajagaha (modern Rajgir in the Nalanda district of Bihar). The other names for the city were Magadhapura, Brihadrathapura, Vasumati, Kushagrapura and Bimbisarapuri. It was an active center of [[Jainism]] in ancient times. The first [[Buddhist Council]] was held in Rajagaha in the Vaibhara Hills. Later on, [[Pataliputra]] became the capital of Magadha.\n\nThe [[Malla (India)|Mallas]] are frequently mentioned in Buddhist and [[Jain]] works. They were a powerful people dwelling in Northern South Asia. According to Mahabharata, Panduputra Bhimasena is said to have conquered the chief of the Mallas/Malls in the course of his expedition in Eastern India. During the Buddhist period, the Mallas/Malls Kshatriya were a republican people with their dominion consisting of nine territories corresponding to the nine confederated clans. These republican states were known as Gana. Two of these confederations – one with [[Kushinagar|Kuśināra]] (modern Kasia near [[Gorakhpur]]) as its capital and the second with Pava (modern Padrauna, 12 miles from Kasia) as the \"capital\" – had become very important at the time of Buddha. Kuśināra and Pava are very important in the history of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] since [[Gautama Buddha|Lord Buddha]] and [[Mahavira|Lord Mahavira]], the 24th [[Tirthankara]] took their last meals at Kushinara and Pava/Pavapuri respectively. Buddha was taken ill at Pava and died at Kusinara, whereas lord Mahavira took his Nirvana at Pavapuri. It is widely believed that Lord Gautam died at the courtyard of King Sastipal Mall of Kushinagar/Kushinara. [[Kushinagar]] is now the centre of the Buddhist pilgrimage circle which is being developed by the tourism development corporation of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe Mallas, like the [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavis]], are mentioned by [[Manusmriti]] as Vratya [[Kshatriya]]s. They are called Vasishthas (Vasetthas) in the Mahapparnibbana Suttanta. The Mallas originally had a monarchical form of government but later they switched to one of [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Samgha]] (republic), the members of which called themselves \"rajas\". The Mallas appeared to have formed an alliance with the Licchhavis for self-defense but lost their independence not long after Buddha's death and their dominions were annexed to the Magadhan empire.\n[[File:War over the Buddha's Relics, South Gate, Stupa no. 1, Sanchi.jpg|thumb|800px|center|[[Malla (Ancient India)|Mallas]] defending the city of [[Kusinagara]], as depicted at [[Sanchi]]. Malla was an [[Republic#Indian subcontinent|ancient Indian republic]] ([[Gaṇa sangha]]) mentioned in the \"[[Anguttara Nikaya]]\".]]\n\nThe country of the [[Matsya]] or Machcha tribe lay to the south of the Kurus and west of the [[Yamuna]], which separated them from the Panchalas. It roughly corresponded to the former state of [[Jaipur]] in [[Rajasthan]], and included the whole of [[Alwar]] with portions of [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]]. The capital of Matsya was at \"Viratanagara\" (modern [[Bairat]]) which is said to have been named after its founder king Virata. In [[Pāli|Pali]] literature, the Matsyas are usually associated with the Surasenas. The western Matsya was the hill tract on the north bank of the [[Chambal River|Chambal]]. A branch of Matsya is also found in later days in the [[Vizagapatam]] region. The Matsyas had not much political importance of their own during the time of Buddha. King Sujata ruled over both the Chedis and Matsyas, thus showing that Matsya once formed a part of the Chedi kingdom.\n\n[[File:Panchalas of Adhichhatra.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Coin of the Panchalas of Adhichhatra (75-50 BCE).<br>Obv [[Indra]] seated facing on pedestal, holding bifurcated object.<br>Rev \"Idramitrasa\" in [[Brahmi]], Panchala symbols.]]\nThe Panchalas occupied the country to the east of the Kurus between the mountains and river Ganges. It roughly corresponded to modern Budaun, Farrukhabad and the adjoining districts of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The country was divided into Uttara-Panchala and Dakshina-Panchala. The northern Panchala had its capital at Adhichhatra or Chhatravati (modern Ramnagar in the [[Bareilly]] District), while southern Panchala had its capital at Kampilya or Kampil in the Farrukhabad District. The famous city of Kanyakubja or [[Kanauj]] was situated in the kingdom of Panchala. Originally a monarchical [[clan]], the Panchals appear to have switched to republican corporation in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. In the 4th century BCE, [[Kautiliya]]'s [[Arthashastra]] also attests the Panchalas as following the \"Rajashabdopajivin\" (king consul) constitution.\n\n[[File:First coin of India.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Silver coin of Surasena mahajanapada (5th century BCE).]]\nThe country of the Surasenas lay to the east of Matsya and west of [[Yamuna]]. This corresponds roughly to the Brij region of Uttar Pradesh, [[Haryana]] and [[Rajasthan]]. and [[Gwalior]] region of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. It had its capital at Madhura or [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]]. Avantiputra, the king of Surasena, was the first among the chief disciples of Buddha, through whose help [[Buddhism]] gained ground in Mathura country. The Andhakas and Vrishnis of Mathura/Surasena are referred to in the [[Ashtadhyayi]] of Pāṇini. In [[Kautiliya]]'s [[Arthashastra]], the Vrishnis are described as \"sangha\" or republic. The Vrishnis, Andhakas and other allied tribes of the [[Yadu|Yadavas]] formed a \"sangha\" and [[Vasudeva]] ([[Krishna]]) is described as the \"sangha-mukhya\". Mathura, the capital of Surasena, was also known at the time of [[Megasthenes]] as the centre of Krishna worship. The Surasena kingdom had lost its independence on annexation by the Magadhan empire.\n\n[[File:Anandastupa.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Ananda Stupa, built by the \"[[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavis]]\" at [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]], which served as the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Vajji|Vajjian Confederacy (Vajji)]], one of the world's earliest [[republic]]s ([[Gaṇa sangha]]).]]\nVajji () or Vrijji was a confederacy of neighbouring clans including the [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavi]]s and one of the principal mahājanapadas of [[Ancient India]]. The area they ruled constitutes the region of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]] in northern [[Bihar]] and their capital was the city of [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]].\n\nBoth the Buddhist text \"Anguttara Nikaya\" and the Jaina text \"Bhagavati Sutra\" (\"Saya\" xv \"Uddesa\" I) included Vajji in their lists of \"solasa\" (sixteen) mahājanapadas. The name of this mahājanapada was derived from one of its ruling clans, the Vṛjis. The Vajji state is indicated to have been a republic. This clan is mentioned by [[Pāṇini]], [[Chanakya]] and [[Xuanzang]].\n\nThe [[Vatsa]]s or Vamsas are called to be a branch of the [[The Kurus|Kurus]]. The Vatsa or Vamsa country corresponded with the territory of modern [[Allahabad]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. It had a monarchical form of government with its capital at [[Kausambi]] (identified with the village Kosam, 38 miles from [[Allahabad]]). Kausambi was a very prosperous city where a large number of wealthy merchants resided. It was the most important entreport of goods and passengers from the north-west and south. Udayana was the ruler of [[Vatsa]] in the 6th-5th century BCE. He was very powerful, warlike and fond of hunting. Initially king Udayana was opposed to [[Buddhism]], but later became a follower of Buddha and made Buddhism the state religion. Udayana's mother, [[Vatsa#Mrigavati|Queen Mrigavati]], is notable for being one of the earliest known female rulers in Indian history.\n\n\"[[Brahmarshi-desha]]\", 'the county of the holy sages,' includes the territories of the [[Kuru Kingdom|Kurus]], [[Matsya Kingdom|Matsyas]], [[Panchala]]s and [[Surasena|Shurasenas]] (i.e., the eastern half of the State of Patiala and of the Delhi division of the Punjab, the Alwar State and adjacent territory in Rajputana, the region which lies between the Ganges and the Jumna, and the [[Mathura district|Muttra District]] in the United Provinces).\n\n\n\n[[Category:Mahajanapadas| 01]]\n[[Category:Ancient Indian geography|*]]\n[[Category:Empires and kingdoms of India]]\n[[Category:Bronze Age countries in Asia]]\n[[Category:Iron Age countries in Asia]]\n[[Category:Iron Age cultures of South Asia]]\n[[Category:Indo-Aryan peoples]]\n[[Category:6th-century BC establishments]]\n[[Category:4th-century BC disestablishments]]"}
{"id": "2207166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207166", "title": "Adams Mine", "text": "Adams Mine\n\nAdams Mine is an abandoned open pit iron ore mine located in the Boston Township of the District of Timiskaming, south of Kirkland Lake in the Canadian provinceof Ontario. It is situated on the Canadian Shield.\n\nThe mine was originally discovered in 1906 however there was little interest in iron ore as a result of the discovery of gold in the Porcupine and Kirkland Lake regions. The site saw renewed interest in the second half of the 1950s and was subsequently developed by the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corp of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania with first production in 1964. The Jones and Laughlin company operated the mine until 1971 when it was sold to Dofasco Steel of Hamilton Ontario. The mine was operated in tandem with the Dofasco owned Sherman Mine. The mine closed in 1990 when the economically retrievable ore reserves were exhausted. The closure also made the Sherman Mine uneconomic and it was also closed. The closure of the two mines in the Timiskaming District along with the resultant job losses left the region in economic hardship from which it has never fully recovered. Perched at one of the highest elevation points in the region, the mine stretched over and had six pits, the largest measuring over in length and the deepest being 183 m (600 ft), placing it below the water table; it is currently half filled with water.\n\nOver 27 years of mining, the pits sustained numerous blasts daily, which some geologists claim have added to natural faults in the rocks. Other geologists and hydrogeologists have claimed that the site is well-situated for hydraulic containment (i.e. water flows in, but doesn't leach into surrounding groundwater or surface water systems).\n\nThere are significant tailings left from the manufacture of ore concentrate at the site. The Ontario Northland Railway operated a line into the Adams Mine facility during its years of operation.\n\nThe mine is currently owned by an American investor named Vito Gallo, through a number company incorporated in Ontario, and is the subject of a NAFTA Chapter 11 arbitration between Gallo, on behalf of the numbered company, and the Government of Canada. The claim is that the Government of Ontario failed to pay proper compensation when it passed legislation that revoked the permits that it had previously granted for the site to be operated as a landfill.\n\nBefore the mine had shut production in the early 1990s, waste management planners from the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto were examining its potential for a massive landfill, with waste to be shipped north in sealed intermodal shipping containers by CN and Ontario Northland on a route. It would be a municipal solid waste (MSW) facility on fractured bedrock using hydraulic containment and no landfill liner.\n\nProponents of the landfill plan pointed to its potential for spurring economic development in Kirkland Lake's struggling economy, while opponents pointed to environmental concerns such as the pit's unstable rock walls, which could potentially leach contaminants into the local groundwater supply.\n\nThe original landfill proposal considering the Adams Mine for Toronto's garbage can be traced to 1989. The following year, the government of Metro Toronto selected the Adams Mine as the preferred site for replacing the Keele Valley Landfill in Vaughan which was rapidly reaching capacity. On 2 April 1991, Ruth Grier, then provincial Minister of the Environment, stated that the provincial government would not allow Toronto to send its garbage to the Adams Mine. In 1995, Metro Toronto began a formal assessment, and the project passed all environmental tests and assessments. The project was rejected at the final vote, in December 1996, to extend the Toronto option on the ownership of the mine because of erroneous information presented by Jack Layton in which he cited the cumulative cost of the project rather than the year by year costs. At the same vote, the Chair, Alan Tonks also changed his position from support of the project to voting against. The final vote was 19-13 against the proposal to extend Toronto's option to use the site. This vote eventually led to Toronto shipping garbage to the US.\n\nIn 1996, the mine's owner, Notre Development, announced plans to revive the Adams Mine proposal through the private sector. Later the same year, the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris made significant changes to the province's Environmental Assessment Act - this resulted in dropping the requirements for a needs assessment and investigation of alternatives to developing a landfill. Technically, this was irrelevant to the Adams Mine proposal as it had already passed all assessments requested of the project. This gave the provincial government the sole authority to impose time and service limits on environmental assessments.\n\nInvestors involved in Notre Development included North Bay businessman Gord McGuinty. Peter Minogue, Harris' best friend whose wife was Harris' local campaign manager, is often mentioned as being involved with Notre but there is no evidence that he ever was.\n\nNotre Development's 1996 proposal involved a consortium that was known as \"Rail Cycle North\"; this included the mine's owner, Notre Development, along with waste management companies Canadian Waste Services and Miller Waste Services, and Ontario Northland Railway and CN.\n\nOn December 16, 1997, the provincial Ministry of the Environment permitted only a limited Environmental Assessment Board hearing on the site's hydraulic containment system. Heavy opposition was expressed in the hearings, but on June 19, 1998, the EAB approved the project. The opponents filed an appeal with the provincial cabinet, which was subsequently rejected that August. An appeal was then filed for a judicial review. In July 1999, that appeal was rejected by the Divisional Court of Ontario and was similarly rejected by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in October of that year.\n\nAt the same time, opponents focused on lobbying the recently amalgamated city of Toronto to not accept the Rail Cycle North proposal. On August 3, 2000, Toronto City Council voted to approve the plan to transport the city's waste to Adams Mine. However, due to the volume of community opposition, council reviewed the issue and voted the proposal down that October. Toronto subsequently pursued a proposal to have its garbage shipped to the Carleton Farms Landfill site in Michigan, since the Keele Valley Landfill, as expected, had reached full capacity.\n\nIn that fall's municipal elections, Adams Mine supporter Bill Enouy was elected mayor of Kirkland Lake.\n\nIn 2001, the Harris government attempted to engineer a campaign of opposition among the Western Ontario communities affected by the Michigan deal, which was seeing hundreds of truckloads of garbage passing on Highway 401 daily; the intent was to force the city of Toronto back into Rail Cycle North's proposal for a landfill using the Adams Mine. The provincial government's campaign included a letter from Michigan Governor John Engler which expressed his state's opposition to accepting Toronto's garbage and explicitly supported the Rail Cycle North proposal, despite the fact that this was perceived as being at odds with Engler's usual positions on waste management. Staffers in Engler's office eventually revealed that the letter had been written at Premier Harris' request.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003, Notre Development and the Rail Cycle North consortium continued to pursue avenues to revive the landfill proposal.\n\nIn 2003, the Ontario Liberal Party, led by Dalton McGuinty, won the provincial election and on April 5, 2004, provincial Minister of Natural Resources David Ramsay and Minister of the Environment Leona Dombrowsky introduced legislation which revoked all certificates and permits related to the Adams Mine proposal. This had the effect of permanently killing the 1996 plan.\n\nCharlie Angus, a local musician and author, was one of the community leaders who organized the campaign against the Adams Mine proposal. He subsequently ran for political office, and was elected to Parliament in the 2004 federal election.\n\nToronto continued to export its trash to Michigan until 2006, causing a great deal of controversy for southern Ontario and Michigan communities which endure the transport of waste through their communities. Critics continue to point out that Toronto's exporting plan avoids forcing the city and region to come to terms with the waste its citizens generate, however there appears to be little political will to reduce consumption and bring about a regional waste management strategy which will avoid the necessity to export to distant landfills.\n\nThe shipping of garbage to Michigan briefly became an issue in the 2004 United States presidential election when John Kerry, on a campaign stop in Michigan, promised to ban the import of Canadian garbage if he was elected. In September, 2005, the Michigan state legislature voted almost unanimously against accepting Toronto's garbage.\n\nDuring Toronto City Council deliberations over the waste site proposal, then-councillors Jack Layton and Olivia Chow surprised their council colleagues by playing \"The Simpsons\" 200th episode, \"Trash of the Titans\", in which the comically inept Homer Simpson becomes sanitation commissioner of Springfield and ends up shoving trash from his own and many other communities into a mine, to deleterious effect. \"It was absolutely stunning,\" Layton later told \"The Globe and Mail\". \"It was so accurate to what was going on.\"\n"}

When he was eight, his mother brought him to London for his education. When he failed the entrance exam to Harrow School, his mother sent him to Pyt House School in Wiltshire. His first encounter with mountains was at 15 when he visited the Pyrenees with his family. The next summer he spent travelling in Norway with a school friend and within a year he had begun climbing seriously.\n\nIn 1928 he went to Kenya as a coffee grower and first climbed Nelion, a peak of Mount Kenya, in 1929. It was also in Kenya's community of Europeans where he met his future climbing partners Bill Tilman and Percy Wyn-Harris. Together with Wyn-Harris, he climbed the twin peaks of Mount Kenya. With Frank Smythe, Shipton was amongst the first climbers to stand on the summit of Kamet, 7756 metres, in 1931, the highest peak climbed at that time. Shipton was involved with most of the Mount Everest expeditions during the 1930s and later, including Hugh Ruttledge's 1933 Mount Everest expedition and the follow-up in 1936, the 1935 Mount Everest expedition which was Shipton's first as leader and the first for Tenzing Norgay, and the pioneering 1951 Mount Everest expedition which chalked out the now famous route over the Khumbu Glacier. Shipton and Tilman also discovered the access route to the Nanda Devi sanctuary through the Rishi Ganga gorge in 1934. Their shoe-string budget expedition operated in the Kumaon-Garhwal mountains continuously from pre-monsoon to post-monsoon, and set a record for single-expedition achievement that has never been equalled.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Shipton was appointed as HM Consul at Kashgar in western China, where he remained from 1940 to 1942, then after a brief spell in England was assigned to work in Persia as a \"Cereal Liaison Officer\" for 20 months during 1943–44. Next he was posted as an attache to the British Military Mission in Hungary as an \"agricultural adviser\" which position saw him through until the end of the War.\n\nIn 1946 Shipton returned to Kashgar as Consul General, and during a visit from Bill Tilman they tried to climb Muztagh Ata, 7546 metres, reaching the broad summit dome. In 1947 Shipton explored and named Shipton's Arch. He took the opportunity of his Kashgar posting to explore other Central Asian mountains. The first western exploration of the Rolwaling Himal was made by Shipton in 1951 during the reconnaissance of Mount Everest. While exploring the Barun gorge he named Island Peak. In the 1951 Everest expedition, Shipton and Dr Michael Ward also took photographs of the footprints of what may have been the Yeti (Abominable Snowman), an ice axe being included in the photographs to show scale. Because of his belief in the efficacy of small expeditions as compared to military-style 'sieges', Shipton was stepped down from the leadership of the 1953 Everest expedition, along with Andrew Croft, in favour of Major John Hunt: \"I leave London absolutely shattered\", he wrote. Between the years 1953 and 1957 he worked at a variety of jobs. Shipton worked as Warden of the Outward Bound Mountain school at Eskdale until the failure of his marriage with his wife, Diana. He worked on farms, collected his CBE, and in 1957 led a group of students from the Imperial College of Science to the Karakoram.\n\nFor the last decade of his life, Shipton continued to travel, supporting himself by lecturing and acting as a celebrity guide. He completed the second volume of his autobiography, \"That Untravelled World\", in 1969. He visited the Galapagos Islands, Alaska, Australia, New Zealand, Rhodesia, Kenya, Chile, Bhutan and Nepal. Whilst staying in Bhutan in 1976, he fell ill; on his return to England, he was diagnosed with cancer to which he succumbed in March 1977. He was cremated in Salisbury and his ashes were scattered on Fonthill Lake in Wiltshire.\n\n\nShipton's grand-daughter Zoe Shipton is an eminent geologist.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2207187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207187", "title": "Sava Centar", "text": "Sava Centar\n\nSava Centar () is an international congress, cultural and business centre of various multi-functional activities located in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is the largest audience hall in the country and entire former Yugoslavia and one of the biggest in Europe. It has been host to numerous large-scale events and performances.\n\nSava Centar is located in the Block 19, in the municipality of New Belgrade. It is situated at 9 \"Milentija Popovića\" street. The complex is bounded by the streets of \"Vladimira Popovića\" to the east, \"Milentija Popovića\" to the west and Bulevar Arsenija Čarnijevića to the south. To the north are other buildings, which occupy the northern section of the Block 19, including the Crowne Plaza Belgrade and Savograd.\n\nIn 1975, after the First Conference of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, held in Helsinki, Finland, the President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito accepted that Belgrade will host the next summit. However, Belgrade had no congressional facility which could accept so many delegates so it was decided to build a new object. The author of the project, chief designer and team manager was Stojan Maksimović, who had only one month to submit the concept. Maksimović spent that month either in seclusion in his office in the City Hall or on the planes, visiting Paris, Copenhagen and Helsinki to see the existing facilities of this type.\n\nWorks began in 1976 and after a bit over a year, the object was ceremonially opened on 14 May 1977 by Tito. Works on the first stage had to be rushed due to the scheduled OSCE conference. This date is today marked as the birthday of Sava Centar, though it was only opening of Block A, followed by Block 2 in 1978 and Block 3 in 1979. The second phase, a large performance and conference hall, opened on the occasion of the 11th Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The planned stage at the main hall, which had been fancied as revolving, was scrapped and a fixed large stage was placed instead. By 1979, Hotel Beograd InterContinental, now the Crowne Plaza Belgrade, was added to the complex to host the annual meeting of the World Bank. Supporting architecture such as roads and highway conjunctions were also built during this period around the Sava Centar complex.\n\nThe complex, due to its design and speed by which it was finished, attracted international attention. It was among the nominated projects when the inaugural Pritzker Architecture Prize was awarded in 1979. Local press of the day named it \"spaceship\", \"glass garden\", \"beauty on the Sava\", \"concrete ship of peace\", \"goodwill house\", etc.\n\nOn 17 August 2006, the parking lot at Sava Centar was renovated to capacitate 410 cars. As a result of the renovation parking fees were introduced for the first time at Sava Centar but are as of 2016/2017 lifted.\n\nIn its jubilee year of 2007, when Sava Centar marked its 30th anniversary, a substantial financing was utilized on the reconstruction of the glass façade. Also, the city authorities funded the reconstruction of broken glass on the sideways-facing façade, acquisition of the stage audio equipment for concert appearances and replacement of the main hall seats.\n\nAs of 2017, the 40-years old complex is in a bad financial situation. After it was built, investments into preserving and enhancing the object were minimal. City, which owns the facility, decided to find a strategic partner who will take 49%, while the city will retain 51% in the future joint company. The bidding was announced in 2016 and two companies, Delta Holding and a consortium headed by the Belgrade's Nikola Tesla Airport showed interest. City then prolonged some of the dates and decided to change some of the conditions of the bidding, so Delta Holding backed off. After the second bidding, the Airport also withdrew not giving any reasons. When the third bidding was announced in June 2017, no one applied. In November 2017 the city hall announced another bidding in the future, but ordered to three city companies (Belgrade power plants, Cleaning and Belgrade waterworks and sewage) to write off all the claims they have from Sava Centar, in order to make it more attractive for the buyers. The bidding was open in December, with city asking for at least €12.5 million.\n\nDespite writing off lots of debts, Sava Centar remained one of the Serbian companies with highest tax debts with 558 million dinars (€4.7 million) in the early 2018. Delta Holding reappeared as an interested investor, claiming willingness to invest double what the city is asking and to build a footbridge to the future Hotel Intercontinental, planned by the Delta Holding in the vicinity. Instead of announcing the bids, city extended the deadline to 20 March 2018. Delta Holding was the only bidder but their application was rejected as \"incomplete\". The commission executing the bidding recommended the direct negotiations with the company, which city administration accepted in July 2018, before changing its mind again in February 2019, opting for the concession, and in November 2019 when city decided to sell the venue. In January 2020 city confirmed it will sell the building with the starting price of €25 million, while the new owner would have to preserve the function of the venue and to invest €50 in the next 5 years.\n\nSava Centar has of useful and of overall area, including a theatre hall with 4,000 seats, 15 conference halls, an exhibition area and a number of other facilities. It annually hosts more than half million visitors. Sava Centar is connected to Crowne Plaza Belgrade via an underground hallway. The complex includes restaurants, bars, offices and shops.\n\nThe great hall, nicknamed the blue hall due to its blue seats is the largest audience hall in the country with the above-mentioned 4,000 seats, both ground and upper level included. The hall has the ability to completely change its look depending on the stage set-up. As a result, the seats can be taken out. It is also the place major cinema premiers are hosted. \n\nIn terms of architecture, Sava Centar is fitted into the larger urban area, which developed later and consists of the Blocks 19 and 20, encompassing buildings in the modern, glass and steel, style. The complex includes:\n\nSava Centar has hosted among others Gennady Rozhdestvensky, Zubin Mehta, Valery Gergiev, Eiji Oue, Mstislav Rostropovich, Henryk Szeryng, Ivo Pogorelić, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Plácido Domingo, Montserrat Caballé, Johan Strauss Orchestra, Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra, The USSR Ministry Of Culture Orchestra, National Symphony Orchestra (NSO), Okazu Philharmonic Orchestra, Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra, Metropole Orchestra, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Nina Simone, Ray Charles, John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, Jerry Lee Lewis, Julio Iglesias, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Suzanne Vega, Nigel Kennedy, B.B. King, Lou Reed, Roxy Music, Jethro Tull, Sting, David Byrne, Simple Minds, Laurie Anderson, Samantha Fox, Jason Donovan, Slobodan Trkulja, Bilja Krstić, Gotan Project and Madredeus.\n\nIt also serves as the venue of the Miss Serbia competition, the Serbian Eurovision Song Contest selection music festivals, Beovizija and was the host place of the Jugovizija (in 1987).\n\nSava Centar has been the host of significant congress gatherings and artistic programs: Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Annual General Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, 55th Annual General Meeting of Interpol, 6th United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, General Meeting of UNESCO, FOREX, FISIT and 9th Summit of the non-aligned countries.\n\nIn January 1990, Sava hosted the 14th (and last) Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.\n\nIn total, from May 1977 to May 2017, over 35,000 events of all kinds were held in the venue, with a total of 15 million visitors, of that 10,000 congressional meetings with 2 million participants.\n\nIn June 2018, it held the 6th WordCamp Europe.\n\n"}

{"id": "2207195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207195", "title": "Chola Nadu", "text": "Chola Nadu\n\nCauvery Delta is a region of Tamil Nadu state in southern India. It encompasses the lower reaches of the Kaveri River and its delta, and formed the cultural homeland and political base of the Chola Dynasty which ruled most of South India and parts of Sri Lanka and South-East Asia between the 9th and 13th centuries AD. Uraiyur (now part of Tiruchirapalli city) served as the early Chola capital, then medieval Cholas shifted to Thanjavur and later cholas king Rajendra Chola I moved the capital to Gangaikonda Cholapuram in the 11th century.\n\nThe boundaries of the region roughly correlates with those of the British India districts of Tanjore and Trichinopoly. Culturally, the region also includes Pudukkottai District, Ariyalur District, Perambalur District, Parts of Karur district and the territory of Karaikal, Pondicherry.\n\nThe Delta region covers Central Tamil Nadu and East-Central Tamil Nadu. The region is sandwiched between the historical regions of Tondai Nadu in the north, the Madurai region in the south and Kongu Nadu in the west and roughly extends from Chidambaram in north to the southern frontier of the erstwhile Pudukkottai kingdom and from Tiruchirapalli in the west to the Bay of Bengal in the east.\n\nAccording to the \"Gazetteer of the Trichinopoly District\", Vol II, 1931, p 67, \"the traditional meeting place of the three Tamil kingdoms was the temple of Cellānti Amman on the banks of the Kāvēri, twelve miles west of Kulittalai and three miles below the junction of the Amarāvati and the Kāvēri. The temple was the common place of worship for the kings of the three Tamil dynasties; a bund which runs to the south of the river marks the boundary between the Cōla and the Pāntya territories, and the Karaipōttanār on the opposite bank of the river was the boundary between the Cōla and the Cēra kingdoms\".\n\nThe genealogy of the Chola empire as found in the Tamil literature and in the many inscriptions left by the later Chola kings contains a number of kings recorded for whom there is no verifiable historic evidence. There are as many versions of this lineage as there are sources for them. The main source is the Sangam literature – particularly, religious literature such as \"Periapuranam\", semi-biographical poems of the later Chola period such as the temple and cave inscription and left by medieval Cholas.\n\nIrrespective of the source, no list of the kings has a high level of historic fact and, while they generally are similar to each other, no two lists are exactly the same. Modern historians consider these lists not as historically reliable sources but as comprehensive conglomerations of various Hindu deities and Puranic characters attributed to local chieftains and invented ancestry of dynasty attempting to re-establish their legitimacy and supremacy in a land they were trying to conquer.\n\nThe history of the region begins with the rise of the Early Chola kingdom in the 4th century BC. The Early Cholas ruled from the town of Uraiyur near Tiruchirapalli and their kingdom comprised the whole of the present-day Cauvery Delta. Flourishing centres of Roman trade have been excavated at Poompuhar stand testimony to a prosperous civilization.\n\nThe Chola Nadu region is renowned as a hub of Tamil culture and civilization. The region has been continuously inhabited since the 1st millennium BC. Arts, crafts and music flourished under the Cholas whose reign is considered to be the golden age in the history of Tamil Nadu. During the hegemony of the Vijayanagar Empire and its successors, the zThanjavur Nayak kingdom, there were frequent migrations of priests, administrators, soldiers and artists from the Telugu and Kannada districts of the north who brought in their traditions, art and dance forms. Despite its rise and initial success in the northern part of Karnataka, Carnatic music actually flourished in the Cauvery Delta. Kambar (poet) was a renowned medieval Tamil poet and the author of the Ramavataram, popularly known as Kambaramayanam, the Tamil version of Ramayana. Kambar also authored other literary works in Tamil, such as 'Thirukkai Vazakkam',Erezhupathu, Silaiezhupathu, Kangai Puranam, sadagopar anthathi, and Sarasvati Anthati hails from the Cauvery Delta region. The three great Carnatic music composers, Tyagaraja, Syama Sastri and Muthuswami Dikshitar who form the Great Trinity of Carnatic music hailed from the Chola Nadu region as also the music composers Muthu Thandavar, Arunachala Kavi and Marimutthu Pillai who form the Tamil Trinity of Carnatic music.\n\nApart from music, dance and drama have also flourished in the Cauvery Delta. The Bhagavathar Melas, a series of dance-dramas, written almost entirely in Telugu, were introduced by migrants who sought refuge in the town of Melattur following the collapse of the Vijayanagar kingdom at the Battle of Talikota.\n\nBharatanatyam, a popular dance form by Bharatha muni, flourished in the dance of \"sadir\" which was practised in the temples of Chola Nadu by ritual temple dances or \"devadasis\". Patronized and financed by dharmakarthas and rich mirasidars, \"sadir\" was popular until the early years of the 20th century when a strong voiced campaign resulted in the devadasi practised being outlawed. Sadir has, since, purged itself of its erotic symbolism and movements and gradually evolved into the commoners' dance Bharathanatyam.\n\nThe Chola Nadu region had a population of over 10 million with a density of above 400 persons per square kilometre in 2001. Due to fertile soil and favourable climate, the region has been the most densely populated in the Tamil country since ancient times.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the population speak Tamil. There is a significant Telugu speaking minority, who had descended from migrants who had mostly moved in during the Vijayanagar and Thanjavur Nayak periods. There are smaller populations speaking Kannada, Saurashtra and Urdu. There are also a considerable body of Marathi speaking people who are mostly present in the urban areas of Thanjavur District and the city of Tiruchirappalli.\n\nThe Chola Nadu region has produced a number of noteworthy personalities in the fields of arts, science, film and politics. Long recognized as a hub of Carnatic music, the region is home to most of India's renowned Carnatic musicians. There have also been important individuals in the field of politics. In British times, civil servants and lawyers from Chola Nadu like Sir T. Madhava Rao, Sir A. Seshayya Sastri, Sir Mohammad Usman, Sir A. T. Panneerselvam, Sir T. Muthuswamy Iyer, Sir P. S. Sivaswami Iyer, T. Ananda Rao, S. Satyamurti, V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, V. P. Madhava Rao and R. Raghunatha Rao dominated the bureaucracy. The maternal ancestors of Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer hailed from Kumbakonam. Tamil writers U. V. Swaminatha Iyer, Samuel Vedanayagam Pillai, V. V. S. Aiyar and Kalki Krishnamurthy, Kalki Sadasivam journalists Kalki Sadasivam, G. A. Natesan and Kasturi Ranga Iyengar, Indian independence activist G. Subramania Iyer who founder \"The Hindu\", politicians M. R. Sethuratnam Iyer and S. Muthiah Mudaliar and Indian media mogul S. S.

Eventually, he was able to attend the École des Beaux-Arts, where he worked with Pierre Révoil until 1818, then studied with Fleury François Richard, after he took over as Director. His studies were, however, sporadic and much was learned on his own. He is, therefore, often referred to as \"self-taught\".\n\nHe also travelled to Italy, Greece and the Middle East. His first exhibition at the Salon in 1824 was well received. That same year, the Archdiocese commissioned four paintings from Révoil's former students, including Biard. In 1827, he travelled again, visiting Malta, Cyprus and Egypt. He later obtained the support of the July Monarchy, which acquired several of his works. In 1838, he was decorated with the Legion of Honor. \n\nIn 1839, he participated in a scientific expedition, led by Joseph Paul Gaimard, that went to Spitsbergen and Lappland. He was joined by his fiancée, the writer Léonie d’Aunet, who published an account of the trip in 1854, entitled \"Voyage d’une femme au Spitzberg\". His sketches served as inspiration for four large panels at the National Museum of Natural History.\n\nHe married Léonie in 1840. Three years later, she became the mistress of Victor Hugo. In 1845, she was caught with him, \"in flagrante delicto\", at a hotel. She was arrested for adultery, but Hugo was let go after invoking his inviolability as a member of the Chamber of Peers. She was taken to the Prison Saint-Lazare, served two months and was remanded to the care of a convent. The marriage was nullified in 1855.\n\nAround 1858, he spent two years in Brazil, where he worked at the court of Emperor Pedro II. Using Rio de Janeiro as a base, he made several excursions into the countryside and to the Amazon, where he was one of the first painters to depict the indigenous people. He was offered a teaching position at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, but declined in favor of continuing his travels. . Before returning to France, he detoured through North America and painted some scenes depicting slavery.. In 1862, his account of his travels in Brazil, with 180 engravings, was published by Hachette under the title \"Deux années au Brésil\". \n\nHe was sometimes criticized for inserting humor in otherwise serious paintings.\n\n\n"}

Thus, historical languages contrast with dead languages (languages which have become extinct, or undergone language death). Also, historical languages contrast with reconstructed languages (that is, the proto-languages) of theoretical linguistics. One of the approaches to defining and using the concept of historical languages is implemented in the ISO 639 standards.\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization (sometimes by means of a registration authority) maintains and publishes standards for languages, among other things: the ISO 639-3 standards for languages include type H, for historical languages, part of a five-way typology to classify languages. Besides the historic languages, there are also ISO 639-3 classifications for living languages (languages with currently living native speakers), extinct languages (for languages whose last native speaker died within the last few centuries), ancient languages (whose last attested native speaker died more than a millennium ago), and constructed languages (which may or may not have native speakers). Old English is an example of a historic language. The ISO 639 language code for Old English is codice_1. A further ISO 639-3 criterion for historic languages is that they have a distinct literature from their descendant languages: in the example of Old English, Beowulf and other works of Old English literature form a distinct body of material.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2207213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207213", "title": "Commencement (album)", "text": "Commencement (album)\n\nCommencement is the debut studio album by American rock band Deadsy, released on May 14, 2002. After initially being suspended upon distribution changes at Sire, the album was officially released through DreamWorks under the Elementree sub-label. It includes the single \"The Key to Gramercy Park\" which gained minor attention for its music video. Despite featuring various guest musicians and the support of popular industry figures such as Jonathan Davis and Fred Durst, \"Commencement\" was a commercial disappointment, and Elementree folded shortly after.\n\nIntended as a much improved edition of Deadsy's first album, \"Commencement\" was originally anticipated for a fall 1999 release under Sire Records; a promotional music video for \"She Likes Big Words\" was filmed from live concert footage. However, the nearly completed record was left in limbo when Sire's distribution deal with Warner Bros. dissolved. Deadsy was soon dropped from the label and given the option of releasing their album underdeveloped or taking the songs elsewhere. During this time, Carlton Bost was added on Ztar and guitar, and \"Creature\" Ashburn Miller replaced \"The Beast\" Craig Riker on bass in January 2002. With the support of Korn's Jonathan Davis, the group signed to Elementree two months after their dismissal from Sire. They would soon begin re-recording and retooling some of the tracks for its official release with co-producers Jay Baumgardner and Josh Abraham. Tracks dating back to Deadsy's 1996 effort were included, and entirely new songs were recorded, such as the lead single, \"The Key to Gramercy Park\". MTV reported in July 2001 that Davis had recorded vocals for the aforementioned track at A&M Studios. This would be his second collaboration with the group.\n\nVocalist Elijah Blue described the situation regarding the delay of \"Commencement\" in 2002:\n\nBlue has cited Gary Numan, Type O Negative, and Black Sabbath as the album's influences. While containing obvious electronic elements of the '80s, such as shrill synthesizer melodies and generously reverberated percussion, the album also features deep, purring guitar distortion characteristic of alternative metal and clean, goth-like vocals that have been described as \"faintly robotic.\" \"Commencement\" features two cover songs: \"Brand New Love\" written by Lou Barlow of the band Sebadoh and \"Tom Sawyer\" by Rush. It also boasts guest appearances by Jonathan Davis (Korn), Troy Van Leeuwen (Failure, A Perfect Circle, Queens of the Stone Age), Jay Gordon (Orgy), and John Taylor (Duran Duran).\n\nElija Blue stated that, although five of the songs were already over six years old and another six were over four years old, \"they are still ahead of the fuckin' curve.\" He also noted that the long delay \"ultimately, for longevity's sake, worked in our favor\" and allowed the songs to develop in re-recording. The material on \"Commencement\" received praise from the late Wayne Static of Static-X who compared it to a combination of Type O Negative and Orgy and described the sound as \"very melodic, lush, beautiful - yet brutally heavy at the same time.\" Regarding its electronic-heavy nature, Blue would later describe the album as \"more synthetic\" compared to Deadsy's 2006 follow-up.\n\n\"Commencement\"'s album art was designed & directed by Josh Gabbard. Its cover depicts a simple illustration of the Hyde Mansion at Allman and Hawkey's alma mater, the Hyde School in Bath, Maine. The mansion is shown behind a fountain of skulls, based on the school's Sunken Garden, which is depicted in stark, relatively flat colors. The backside features all five band members standing over a world map, simply illustrated with blank white eyes and their signature color schemes. The CD tray is flat white, a feature uncharacteristic of the metal genre. The disc itself and the liner notes feature a white chain link pattern used throughout the promotion of \"Commencement\". Each member is represented in the liner notes by a signature color (red, blue, yellow, green, and gray), stage name, and graphic.\n\nThere are five known variations of the Commencement album artwork. The differences are slight and no official statement has surfaced on the reasoning behind them.\n\nDeadsy opened for Static-X, Stone Temple Pilots, Staind, and Linkin Park on the Family Values Tour in the fall of 2001. The band also opened for Static-X on a few dates of their own tour. During this time, Deadsy's Elijah Blue contributed vocals to \"What's Going On (Reality Check Mix)\" a collaborative reworking led by Fred Durst. In May, Deadsy performed with Papa Roach and the following month joined Puddle of Mudd for the US leg of Korn's Untouchables Tour. Late in the summer, keyboardist Dr. Nner allegedly broke both wrists but continued touring. The band played with Taproot and Dredg in August.\n\n\"The Key to Gramercy Park\" was originally released alongside \"Mansion World\" as a double A-sided single in late 2001. It was then re-released in anticipation of \"Commencement\" and to coincide with its music video. The video was directed by Fred Durst at Hayvenhurst Studios in Van Nuys, California and debuted on April 31, 2002. Durst, who became after a fan after hearing Deadsy's earlier material, praised the band's willingness to shoot extensively in a cloud of CO2: \"I laid down in it for 10 seconds and my throat dried up and I was feeling nauseous. These guys have been in it for three hours... This is their first video and they are seriously taking a beating.\" The haunting video has each member associated with a specific color and graphic. Frontman Elija Blue noted that it \"has sort of a remedial context to its visuals. It kind of explains a little bit about the band.\" Blue also described the song as \"kind of the Trojan horse of the record... We feel like this is simply a good rock jam. It's very impressionistic. It's very powerful and simply in your face.\" The song did not manage to chart.\n\nA remixed cover of Sebadoh's \"Brand New Love\" would serve as a follow-up single in October 2002. It, too, had a music video released in November which contained concert footage with brief cameos of numerous tour mates. Like its predecessor, \"Brand New Love\" would not land on the charts. Deadsy had reportedly wanted to release \"Winners\" or \"Mansion World\" as a third single, but this did not occur.\n\nA live performance of \"Tom Sawyer\" was included on the \"Family Values Tour 2001\" compilation released in May 2002. A remix of the track \"Mansion World\" by trance music group Deepsky was included on their 2002 album \"In Silico\", titled \"The Mansion World (Deepsky's Trippin' in Unknown Territory Mix).\"\n\n\"Commencement\" received mixed reviews. Metacritic gives it 56/100 based on five critics. \"Rolling Stone\" offered a mediocre response and sarcastically compared the band to a \"hilariously high-concept prank.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s Jim Farber lamented, \"If only they didn't sound like a dying Flock of Seagulls. The fivesome's cheesy '80s new-wave music may explain why it took seven years for a label to release their debut. But at this point, Deadsy sound D.O.A.\"\n\nOne stand-out review of acclamation came from \"Alternative Press\" which noted \"Deadsy's mix of electronics, death-metal distortion and lugubrious vocals offers something magnificently alien, yet familiar.\" Allmusic's Robert L. Doerschuk gave a somewhat positive review but emphasized the band's retro influences, stating, \"A guest shot by Korn vocalist Jonathan Davis on \"The Key to Gramercy Park\" reminds listeners of the band's currency, but it's easy to mistake \"Commencement\" for an '80s artifact.\"\n\nDeadsy's association with Korn and Fred Durst and critical tour slots gained them mainstream exposure and significant press attention. However, despite the support of the nu metal flagships, Deadsy's moment in the spotlight was somewhat fleeting. Neither single managed to chart, and \"Commencement\" did not meet sales expectations. SoundScan reported that the album has sold more than 175,000 copies as of May 1, 2008.\n\n\n"}

These nine highways are current or former sections of the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard between Annapolis and Baltimore via Glen Burnie. There are five signed mainline segments of MD 648 through Arnold, Severna Park, Pasadena, Glen Burnie, Ferndale, and Pumphrey in northern Anne Arundel County; Baltimore Highlands in southern Baltimore County; and the independent city of Baltimore. MD 648 mainly serves local traffic along its meandering route, with long-distance traffic intended to use the parallel and straighter MD 2 south of Glen Burnie and freeway-grade Interstate 97, I-695, and MD 295 between Glen Burnie and Baltimore.\n\nThe Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard was constructed in the early to mid-1910s as the primary highway between Baltimore and Annapolis. The highway was specifically authorized by the Maryland General Assembly, which insisted the Maryland State Roads Commission complete the highway along its originally planned route instead of using what is now MD 2 north of Glen Burnie. The boulevard was designated parts of MD 2 and MD 3 in 1927; the latter number was replaced with U.S. Route 301 (US 301) in 1939. MD 648 was assigned to the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard south of Glen Burnie in the late 1930s after it was functionally replaced by MD 2's present course. In the late 1950s, after US 301 was moved to freeways from south of Glen Burnie to Baltimore, MD 648 was extended north from Glen Burnie into Baltimore. MD 648 has had few major changes since then, the most significant being relocations between Pasadena and Glen Burnie in the 1970s.\n\nThere are five mainline segments of MD 648.\n\nMD 648A begins at an intersection with MD 450 (Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard/Governor Ritchie Highway) just east of the Naval Academy Bridge that crosses the Severn River into the city of Annapolis. The state highway heads east and immediately intersects the access road for Jonas Green Park, which is unsigned MD 648AB. At the junction with MD 672 (Greenbury Point Road), which serves several facilities of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Naval Academy, MD 648 turns north and meets the west end of MD 179 (Saint Margarets Road). The state highway continues north through a forested residential area to its terminus at a dead end just south of US 50 and US 301, which run concurrently as Blue Star Memorial Highway. The westbound direction of the freeway has a right-in/right-out intersection with MD 648F directly opposite from the dead end of MD 648A. MD 648F heads west parallel to the freeway then turns north to a partial intersection with MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway). There is no access from northbound MD 648F to southbound MD 2.\nThere are two county-maintained segments of Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard on the southbound and northbound sides, respectively, of MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) through Arnold. MD 648D begins at an intersection with MD 2 in Arnold a short distance north of the second county highway loop. The state highway parallels the southbound direction of MD 2 and the Baltimore & Annapolis Trail, which the highway follows closely except close to its termini. On the northern end of Arnold, MD 648 and MD 2 approach closely; within this stretch there is a spur from MD 648 to southbound MD 2 and a spur from both directions of MD 2 to MD 648. The state highway leaves the vicinity of MD 2 then splits from the rail trail to its northern terminus at an oblique intersection with MD 2 within a commercial area in Severna Park.\nMD 648H begins at an intersection with MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) in Severna Park. The state highway heads east, crossing Cattail Creek before intersecting Asbury Drive, which is unsigned MD 648AA. MD 648 veers north through residential subdivisions in Pasadena. The state highway passes along the eastern edge of Waterford Park, where the highway crosses the Magothy River just downstream from its impoundment, Lake Waterford. Just north of the lake, Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard veers to the northwest as unsigned MD 915. MD 648 continues north as Waterford Road. The state highway crosses over MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway) with no access before reaching its northern terminus at MD 177 (Mountain Road).\nMD 648E, which is the longest section of MD 648, is mostly located in Anne Arundel County; a small portion of the highway passes through the southeastern corner of Baltimore County before heading into Baltimore, where the highway is maintained by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation. MD 648 has freeway connections with MD 10 and I-97 in Glen Burnie, I-695 in Ferndale, and MD 295 in Baltimore. The state highway is a part of the National Highway System between I-97 and the entrance to the Cromwell / Glen Burnie station of MTA Maryland's Baltimore Light RailLink.\n\nMD 648E begins at an intersection with MD 177 (Mountain Road) and Jumpers Hole Road at Lipins Corner near Pasadena, about west of the intersection of MD 177 and MD 648H. This intersection is a short distance to the east of MD 177's partial interchanges with MD 10 and MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Highway) and the highway's western terminus at MD 2. MD 648 heads north as a three-lane road with center turn lane through residential subdivisions. The state highway expands to a five-lane road with center turn lane as it curves to the west, crosses Marley Creek, and intersects MD 270 (Furnace Branch Road); the south leg of that intersection is unsigned MD 648G, which is also named Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard. MD 648 temporarily becomes a four-lane divided highway through its partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 10 (Arundel Expressway).\nMD 648 reduces to two lanes as it passes through a residential neighborhood in Glen Burnie, passing to the north of Glen Burnie High School. The state highway curves to the northwest through a commercial area in the center of the suburb where the highway intersects MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) and MD 3 Business (Robert Crain Highway). MD 648 expands to a four-lane undivided highway at its intersection with Eighth Avenue and MD 176 (Dorsey Road), which heads west toward Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. The state highway begins to parallel MTA Maryland's Baltimore Light RailLink and its southern terminal station, Cromwell / Glen Burnie station. North of the station, MD 648 becomes divided and has a folded diamond interchange with I-97.\n\nMD 648 continues to parallel the transit line as a two-lane road north through Ferndale. The state highway passes the Ferndale station in the center of the community. MD 648 veers north away from the transit line at Hollins Ferry Road, then passes North County High School and crosses Cabin Branch. The state highway intersects Furnace Branch Road and the eastern end of MD 169 (Maple Road) prior to meeting I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. In the center of Pumphrey, MD 648 intersects MD 170, which heads northeast as Belle Grove Road and southwest as Camp Meade Road past the North Linthicum station on the light rail line. The state highway passes under the Baltimore Light RailLink tracks and begins to parallel them. MD 648 intersects MD 168 (Nursery Road) just west of the Nursery Road station shortly before the highway veers away from the transit line and crosses the Patapsco River.\nMD 648 continues north as Old Annapolis Road, crossing under I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) with no access before passing through the suburb of Baltimore Highlands in the southeastern corner of Baltimore County. The state highway enters the city of Baltimore and its name changes to Annapolis Road shortly before intersecting Patapsco Avenue. MD 648 crosses over MD 295 (Baltimore–Washington Parkway) and under the Curtis Bay Branch of CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision. The state highway intersects ramps to and from the southbound parkway as it passes to the east of Mount Auburn Cemetery. MD 648 has a pair of intersections with Waterview Avenue on both sides of an east–west segment to cross to the east side of MD 295. The state highway passes through the Westport neighborhood, where Wenburn Street and Manokin Street lead west to ramps with the northbound and southbound directions of the parkway, respectively. MD 648 meets a pair of rail lines at grade, intersects Monroe Street, and passes under I-95 before crossing over Gwynns Falls. The state highway reaches its northern terminus at a right-in/right-out interchange with the ramp from northbound I-95 to northbound MD 295, which continues north as Russell Street toward Downtown Baltimore.\n\nMD 648E is a part of the National Highway System as an intermodal connector from the entrance to the Cromwell Station / Glen Burnie light rail station to I-97 in Glen Burnie.\n\nIn 1910, the Maryland General Assembly authorized funding for the construction of a boulevard between Annapolis and Baltimore. This boulevard, which would have a minimum road width of , would begin in Annapolis, cross the Severn River, head northwest to Glen Burnie, and continue through Anne Arundel and Baltimore counties to the tracks of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in South Baltimore. The newly formed Maryland State Roads Commission was placed in charge of constructing the new Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard. The boulevard was constructed as a wide macadam road from the Severn River north to Arnold and from Severna Park to Pasadena in 1910 and 1911. The sections between Arnold and Severna Park and from Pasadena to Glen Burnie were completed in 1912. The boulevard followed much of what is today MD 648, with the major difference being in Pasadena, where instead of following Waterford Road north to MD 177, the boulevard headed northwest along what are discontinuous segments of MD 915 to Lipins Corner.\n\nUnrelated to the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard, the commission constructed a wide macadam road from Glen Burnie to Brooklyn, which was then in Anne Arundel County. In Brooklyn, the new highway connected with the south end of the Light Street Bridge that crossed the Patapsco River into Baltimore. The first section of the highway between Glen Burnie and South Baltimore was an wide macadam road that had been started in 1909, prior to the 1910 act. This highway was completed in 1911 from the Western Maryland Railway crossing in Westport, then part of Anne Arundel County, south to the English Consul Estate, which is now the community of Baltimore Highlands. With a road completed from Annapolis to Baltimore, the roads commission suggested that it should not be required to complete a road between Glen Burnie and South Baltimore. The commission asked the Maryland General Assembly to pass a bill releasing the commission from the responsibility of completing the highway from Glen Burnie to South Baltimore.\n\nHowever, the Maryland General Assembly disagreed with the Maryland State Roads Commission and passed a bill in 1914 requiring the commission to finish the boulevard between Glen Burnie and South Baltimore. The Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard was constructed as a wide concrete road from Glen Burnie to Pumphrey and from the Patapsco River to the English Consul Estate in 1914 and 1915. The northernmost part of the boulevard was constructed as a wide street surfaced with asphalt, bricks, and granite blocks from Westport into the city, where the highway followed Russell Street, Bush Street, and Ridgely Street to the B&O Railroad crossing southwest of the present location of M&T Bank Stadium. The final section of the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard was completed in 1916 as a wide concrete road from Pumphrey to the Patapsco River. This segment included a wide, high underpass of the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway at Pumphrey completed the same year.\n\nThe entire length of the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard was widened to with a pair of wide concrete shoulders by 1927. The highway's bridge over Marley Creek was rebuilt from a width of to in 1926. When the Maryland State Roads Commission first assigned numbers to state highways in 1927, the boulevard from Annapolis to Glen Burnie was designated MD 2, and the highway from Glen Burnie to Baltimore via Pumphrey was designated MD 3. In 1930, a concrete cut-off was built in Glen Burnie that allowed MD 2 traffic to bypass the community's central intersection to the northeast. By 1933, Russell Street was extended south from Bush Street to Waterview Avenue in Baltimore. MD 3 was relocated onto Russell Street from Annapolis Road, bypassing the Westport neighborhood, by 1936.\n\nIn 1934, the Maryland State Roads Commission recommended expanding Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard to at least in width for its entire length, with a width of urged from MD 177 to MD 3 and on MD 2 from the center of Glen Burnie to Furnace Branch. The first portion of Governor Ritchie Highway was completed as a four-lane divided upgrade to existing MD 2 from the Baltimore city limit in Brooklyn Park to Furnace Branch in 1934 and 1935. Construction on the remainder of Governor Ritchie Highway began in 1936 and was completed south from Furnace Branch to the Severn River in 1938. All old segments of MD 2 were redesignated MD 648 by 1939. This includes the portion of Robert Crain Highway from Glen Burnie to Furnace Branch that is now the northern part of MD 3 Business. That same year, MD 3 was replaced by US 301 through Southern Maryland and along Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard from Glen Burnie to Baltimore.\n\nDuring World War II, the Waterford Road section of MD 648 was built as MD 706 and the Pumphrey grade separation with the defunct WB&A Railway was dismantled and the road widened. In 1949, the portion of MD 648 on Robert Crain Highway was widened and resurfaced, shortly before it was replaced with US 301 Alternate, which ran concurrently with MD 2 from Furnace Branch into Baltimore. US 301 proper was widened to from the Baltimore city limits to Pumphrey in 1950 and from Pumphrey to Glen Burnie in 1951. MD 648 was widened and resurfaced from US 301 in Glen Burnie south to MD 177 at Lipins Corner between 1954 and 1956. The Glen Burnie Bypass (now I-97) was completed in 1956. US 301 was moved from Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard to the Glen Burnie Bypass, the Expressway Connector that would become the Baltimore Beltway, and the Baltimore–Washington Expressway (now MD 295) into the city of Baltimore in 1957, two years before the US 301 was relocated to the Eastern Shore of Maryland and replaced with MD 3. MD 648 was then extended from Glen Burnie through Pumphrey to its crossing of the Baltimore–Washington Expressway just north of the Baltimore city limits.\n\nMD 648 replaced MD 706 on Waterford Road when MD 100 was completed in 1971; the old segments of MD 648 became MD 915. MD 648 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway at Marley Creek, including a new bridge over the creek, when the highway's interchange with MD 10 was built in 1976. By 1977, MD 648 had been extended north in Baltimore to its present northern terminus. The highway was expanded to a divided highway at its interchange with I-695 when the bridge over the Interstate was replaced in 1989. The southern end of what is now MD 648H was relocated in Severna Park to cross Cattail Creek and have a perpendicular intersection with MD 2 in 1989; the old alignment along Asbury Drive became MD 648AA. By 1999, the portions of Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard between US 50 and MD 648D in Arnold had been transferred to county maintenance, and all segments of MD 648 existed as they do today.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2207261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207261", "title": "Trade Adjustment Assistance", "text": "Trade Adjustment Assistance\n\nTrade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) is a federal program of the United States government to act as a way to reduce the damaging impact of imports felt by certain sectors of the U.S. economy. The current structure features four components of Trade Adjustment Assistance: for workers, firms, farmers, and communities. Each cabinet-level department was tasked with a different sector of the overall Trade Adjustment Assistance program. The program for workers is the largest, and administered by the U.S. Department of Labor. The program for farmers is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the firms and communities programs are administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nTrade Adjustment Assistance consists of four programs authorized under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and defined further under the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. § 2341 et seq) (Trade Act). The original idea for a trade compensation program goes back to 1939. Later, it was proposed by President John F. Kennedy as part of the total package to open up free trade. President Kennedy said: \"When considerations of national policy make it desirable to avoid higher tariffs, those injured by that competition should not be required to bear the full brunt of the impact. Rather, the burden of economic adjustment should be borne in part by the Federal Government.\"\n\nSupporters argue that free trade offers widespread benefits among consumers, workers and firms in the U.S. in terms of lower prices, higher efficiency and quality, and more jobs. They claim that gains from negotiated trade deals are large and widely distributed across sectors. For example, in 2011 there were 9.7 million jobs supported by exports, nearly 15% more than in 2010. Benefits from free trade agreements (FTA) with Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, and South Korea for the U.S. economy are estimated in $4 billion, $17 billion, $19 billion, $6 billion and $30 billion, respectively.\n\nIn order to achieve trade benefits, however, the U.S. economy must reallocate production factors between sectors. Thus, free trade also leads to costs associated with workers displaced by import competition and offshore outsourcing. According to the Department of Labor (DOL), displaced workers are defined as \"persons 20 years of age and older who lost or left jobs because their plant or company closed or moved, there was insufficient work for them to do, or their position or shift was abolished\". The International Labour Organization (ILO) states that workers bore high adjustment costs such as unemployment, lower wage during transition, obsolescence of skills, training costs, and personal costs (e.g. mental suffering). These trade costs, albeit relatively smaller than the benefits, are highly concentrated by region, industry and worker demographics. For instance, some occupations, like teacher, have not experienced import competition while for shoe manufacturing occupations import competition has increased by 40 percentage points.\n\nIn general, manufacturing workers are most affected by import competition compare to workers in other sectors. Furthermore, while gains from trade require a long time to take full effect, costs are felt rapidly, particularly in less competitive sectors.\n\nThere is a strong correlation between import penetration and unemployment. Ebenstein et al. (2009) find that a 1 percentage point increase in import penetration leads to a 0.6 percentage point decrease in manufacturing employment in the U.S. resulting in a reduction of manufacturing jobs of almost 5%. According to a report by the Progressive Policy Institute, between 2007 and 2011, 1.3 million direct and indirect jobs were lost to increasing imports of goods and services. Similarly, Kletzer (2005) estimations suggest that industries facing high import competition account for 40% of manufacturing job losses. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) estimates that by 2015 the overall U.S. trade deficit will correspond to the loss of additional 214,000 jobs.\n\nAlthough trade-dislocated workers are not significantly different from workers displaced by other reasons, they present some slight differences. They tend to be older, less educated, more tenured and production-oriented, have higher earnings on the lost job and fewer transferable skills, and the prevalence on women is higher than for other displaced workers. These characteristics are associated with limited labor mobility and reemployment difficulties, especially for workers with obsolete skills who do not receive additional training, no matter the reason of displacement. Furthermore, asymmetric information in absence of good job-search skills and geographic mismatch lead to prolonged unemployment. Hence, trade-displaced workers face longer periods to find a new job and have low reemployment rates (63% during the last two decades according to Kletzer, 2005). Reemployment is particularly challenging for older workers. The DOL (2012) reports that in 2012 reemployment rates for workers ages 55 to 64 and 65 years and over were 47 and 24% respectively while the rate for those ages 20 to 54 was about 62%.\n\nOnce dislocated workers obtain a new job, they suffer significant wage reductions. About two thirds of dislocated workers have lower wages in the new job and one quarter of displaced workers from manufacturing who find a new full-time job suffer earning losses of 30% or more. The reason is that many workers find jobs in services sector where salaries are lower. Ebenstein et al. (2009) find that displaced workers from manufacturing who find a job in the services sector suffer a wage decline of between 6 and 22%. They conclude that a 1 percentage point increase in occupation-specific import competition is associated with a 0.25 percentage point decline in real wages.\n\nImport competition impacts negatively not only dislocated workers but also their families and communities. Displaced workers fall behind in their mortgage payments and in providing health care to their families. Families must spend down assets to smooth consumption. There is evidence that displaced workers are in worse health after losing a job. According to a Report by the Corporation for Enterprise Development (CFED), more than 46% of the jobless lack health insurance and 31% of workers without insurance do not see a doctor although sick. If the worker is able to be relocated in other job in other region the whole family is displaced and children are uprooted from their schools, increasing domestic tensions. The phenomenon of displaced workers has a broader impact because it also affects aggregate demand for goods and services and tax collections.\n\nIn brief, trade leads to an unequal redistribution of costs and benefits. The adjustment process impacts not only displaced workers but also the whole society and economy. Furthermore, labor reallocation from inefficient to competitive sectors aimed at realizing the benefits of trade can be impeded by several obstacles described above, prolonging the transition period and increasing the adjustment costs. In this framework, several scholars and policy-makers have argued that trade-related adjustment costs merit a policy response.\nThe TAA has persisted for more than five decades showing ample political support. Having an assistance program targeted exclusively at trade-displaced workers enjoyed wide political support among Congressional representatives in the past because the program served to decrease political resistance to and workers' lobbying efforts against FTAs. As a 2012 Report by the Joint Economic Committee states: \"TAA needs to remain an integral part of trade policy because it compensates those harmed by import competition without sacrificing the larger demonstrable benefits of trade.\"\n\nThe Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration program, Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers, provides a variety of reemployment services including training and job-searching assistance and benefits to displaced workers who have lost their jobs or suffered a reduction of hours and wages as a result of increased imports or shifts in production outside the United States. The TAA program aims to help program participants obtain new jobs faster, ensuring they retain employment and earn wages comparable to their prior employment. Among the main benefits are: trade readjustment allowances (TRA) in addition to regular unemployment insurance (UI) up to 117 weeks of cash payments for all workers concurrently enrolled only in full-time training (workers must be enrolled in training 8 weeks after certification or 16 weeks after layoff, whichever is later, to receive TRA), and Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) or supplementary wages for workers age 50 and over, and earning less than $50,000 per year in reemployment. It provides a wage supplement equal to 50% of the difference between a worker's reemployment wage and wage at the worker's certified job with a maximum benefit of $10,000 over a period of up to two years (workers must be reemployed within 26 weeks). The TAA used to include a Health Coverage Tax Credit Program which will definitively expire at the end of 2013 and other tax credits related to health coverage will become available (e.g. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). The program promotes retraining since workers receive the TRAs only if they participate in a full-time TAA training (or are under a waiver). The program is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) in cooperation with the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe Secretary of Labor was authorized to implement Trade Readjustment Assistance (TRA) and relocation allowances through cooperating state agencies. TRA are income support payments that were, at that time, paid in addition to an individual's regular unemployment compensation. The original program had no training or reemployment component. The program was rarely used until 1974, when it was expanded as part of the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Act of 1974 established the training component of the program. In 1981, the program was sharply curtailed by the Congress at the request of the Reagan Administration. In 2002, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act (TAARA) expanded the program and it was combined with the trade adjustment program provided under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\nThe TAA has recently suffered several amendments. In 2009, the TAA program was expanded by the Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act (TGAAA) of 2009, which was part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. These benefits were extended through February 2011 by the Omnibus Trade Act of 2010. After that, the program reverted to the pre-expansion provisions under the TAARA of 2002. In October 2011, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act (TAAEA) of 2011 was signed into law, reinstating most of the benefits included in the TGAAA of 2009. The TAA is authorized through December 31, 2014 but with some modifications. The TAA will operate under its current provisions through December 31, 2013. For the additional year until its expiration on December 31, 2014, the TAA is set to operate under the eligibility and benefit levels established by the TAARA of 2002.\n\nThe Department of Commerce program, Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms, provides financial assistance to manufacturers and service firms affected by import competition. Sponsored by the Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA), this cost-sharing federal assistance program helps pay for projects that improve firms' competitiveness. EDA, through a national network of 11 Trade Adjustment Assistance Centers (TAACs), provides technical assistance on a cost-shared basis to U.S. manufacturing, production, and service firms in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n\nTrade Adjustment Assistance for Firms provides import impacted companies with professional guidance, business recovery plan development, and cost-sharing for outside consulting services. Eligibility is established along similar lines, with companies showing that there has been a recent decrease in sales and employment, in part due to customers shifting purchases away from the applicant and to imported goods. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 expanded eligibility to service firms as well as the traditional manufacturing companies that had been the sole focus of the program. This expansion for service firms and workers was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2010, and the program would revert to the pre-ARRA structure without a vote to extend the authorization.\n\nTrade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers, created in 2002 by wide-ranging trade legislation (P.L. 107-210, Sec. 141), authorizes the expenditure of up to $90 million per year through FY2007. Under the program, certain agricultural producers can each receive payments of up to $10,000 per year if price declines for their commodity were at least partly caused by imports. To be eligible for such assistance, such producers must be members of certified groups and meet a number of criteria specified by the law. The program is administered by the Department of Agriculture.\n\nWorkers must be directly impacted by imports or by a shift in production of their firm to any country with a free trade agreement with the United States or to beneficiary countries under the Andean Trade Preference, the African Growth and Opportunity, or by certain other shifts in production. Employees of upstream suppliers are eligible if the product supplied to the primary firm consists 20% of the production or sales of the secondary workers' firm, or their employer's loss of business with the primary firm contributed significantly to the secondary workers' separation from work.\n\nEmployees of downstream producers are eligible if they perform additional, value-added production processes for articles produced by primary firms, and the primary certification was based on an increase in imports or a shift in production to Canada or Mexico.\n\nIn order to receive the benefits displaced workers must fill a petition as a group to initiate the investigation to address the reasons of their layoff. Once the DOL finds that trade has contributed notably to the layoff, the group is certified but the individual worker must still apply for benefits at a local One-Stop Career Center.\n\nUnder the current law, as modified in 2009, workers in most service jobs (call center operators, for example) are eligible for trade adjustment assistance. In 2004, a group of computer experts displaced by overseas labor tried to apply for trade adjustment assistance but were rejected because computer software was not considered an \"article\" by the DOL. After a series of scathing decisions by the United States Court of International Trade criticizing the DOL's approach, the DOL revised its policies in April 2006 to extend trade adjustment assistance to more workers producing digital products such as software code. Nevertheless, the program under the TAARA of 2002 starting on January 1, 2014 does not include trade-displaced workers in services sectors.\n\nFarmers and ranchers adversely impacted by trade will be eligible to participate in a new program operated by the Department of Agriculture and are potentially eligible to receive training under TAA. They are not eligible for the Trade Readjustment Allowance.\n\nThere are several components of the overall cost of the program. The principal spending of the program is in reemployment services which are set to the annual funding levels of the Trade Act of 2002: $220 million for state grants (plus administrative allotments equal to 15% of each state's grant). The TRA income support and RTAA wage insurance program are uncapped entitlements. In FY 2011, the cost of TRA was $234,126,500 and the cost of RTAA was $43,227,212, based on the number of participants of each program in this year (25,689 and 1,133 participants respectively).\n\nThe TAA for workers have demonstrated overall low effectiveness so far which is reflected in the controversy to reauthorize the program before the 112th Congress.\n\nFirst, the program is not very effective providing support during the transition because a significant portion of workers does not receive TRA. In FY2011 there were over 196,000 TAA participants and only around 46,000 received TRA. One reason is that the training enrollment deadline of 8/16 weeks seriously limits the ability of workers to enroll in training programs and receive the benefit. Moreover, even for those workers receiving TRA and UI, only a portion of the lost income is replaced. The program provides health insurance coverage but in the past it has not been very effective since participation in TAA was associated with decreased coverage in the period following job loss.\n\nThe effectiveness of the program in terms of fostering reemployment is very low too. Data on post-TAA outcomes for program exiters based on DOL estimations shows that the entered employment rate was 66% in 2011. The Mathematica Policy Research and SPR report finds that the TAA is not effective in terms of increasing employability. There is positive effect on the reemployment rate for participants but it is not statistically different from that for non-participants.\n\nThe effectiveness of the program in terms of mitigating earning losses in the new job is very low too as several studies report. Reynolds and Palatucci (2008) estimate that \"participating in the TAA program causes a wage loss approximately 10 percentage points greater than if the displaced worker had chosen not to participate in the program.\" The report by Mathematica Policy Research and SPR states that TAA was estimated to have no effect on earnings and compared to a sample of UI claimants, TAA participants worked about the same number of weeks but had lower earnings.\n\nMoreover, a 2007 GAO report shows that in FY 2006 only 5% or less of TAA participants received wage insurance. The program is ineffective closing the earning gap because in order to be eligible for wage insurance workers must find a job within 26 weeks after being laid off, which proved to be a very short period. Additionally, the program only replaces half of the losses.\n\nFinally, the implementation of this program overlaps extensively with others such as Workforce Investment Act generating extra costs and duplicating administrative efforts. The process to allocate training funds is also problematic. States receive funds at the beginning of the fiscal year but it does not properly reflect the state's demand for training services. In addition, states do not receive funds for case management and lack flexibility to use the funds for training. Thus, states face challenges in providing services to workers properly.\n\nOver last years, the TAA program has been subject to diverse critics due to its flawed performance and extremely high cost. The TAA was only extended to the end of 2014 and the last reauthorization process before the 112th Congress exposed a lack of consensus about the program.\nSeveral scholars from different institutions have proposed policy alternatives.\n\nThe Financial Services Forum, through its 2008 white paper \"Succeeding in the Global Economy: An Adjustment Assistance Program for American Workers,\" proposes to combine the UI and TAA programs into a single integrated program for all displaced workers who qualify for UI no matter the reason of displacement The program includes: wage insurance, portability of health insurance (under the current program COBRA), and reemployment services such as assistance with geographic relocation and retraining. The wage insurance would cushion the cost of lower wages in the new job for workers age 45 and older. The program replaces 50% of workers' lost wages for up to two years, for up to $10,000 per year, for workers that hold the previous job for at least two years. Regarding retraining, workers would be able to deduct from their gross income, for tax purposes, the full cost of education and training expenses, and there will be no limitations in terms of area of training.\n\nThe estimated annual cost of the program is $22 billion. The Financial Services Forum proposes to replace the current tax system with a flat 1.2% tax on all earning at the state level, and a flat rate of 0.12% on all earnings at the federal level to pay for the program.\n\nScholars at the Brookings Institution and the Institute for International Economics proposed a twofold program including a wage insurance and subsidy for medical insurance in addition to the UI program for eligible workers. On the one hand, the program covers workers displaced by any reason, not just trade, who suffer an earning loss after reemployment. Displaced workers defined as \"workers displaced due to plant closing or relocation, elimination of position or shift, and insufficient work\".\n\nIt would replace a portion between 30% and 70% of the difference between earnings on the old and new job. In order to be eligible, workers must have been employed full-time at their previous job for at least two years, and suffered a wage decrease that can be documented. The insurance would be paid only after workers found a new job and they will receive it for up to two years from the original date of job loss. Annual payments would be capped at $10,000 or $20,000 per year. The payments would be administered through state UI.\n\nIn addition, the program would also offer a health insurance subsidy for all full-time displaced workers, for up to 6 months, or until they found a new job (whichever is earlier). Workers would be limited to receiving the subsidy no more frequently than once during a certain period, probably 3 or 4 years, in order to prevent job churning.\n\nIn 2001, Robert Litan and Lori Kletzer estimated that about 20% of displaced workers reemployed full-time would have had at least 2 years' tenure on their previous job and suffered a wage loss in the new one. The program would cost from $2 to $5 billion per year. This cost is estimated with a national unemployment rate between 4.2% and 4.9%. In 2012, the average national unemployment rate was 8.9%. Consequently, the projected cost would be higher if the program would be implemented today.\n\n"}

She saw active service during the Second World War, especially as a convoy escort in the North Atlantic.\n\n\"Scarborough\" was ordered on 26 February 1929 under the 1929 building programme and was laid down at the yards of Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd., Wallsend-on-Tyne on 28 May 1929. She was launched on 14 March 1930 and commissioned on 31 July 1930.\n\nFrom 1931 onwards, \"Scarborough\" was part of the North America and West Indies Squadron stationed at Bermuda. The First World War hero, Augustus Agar V.C., was her captain in the early 1930s. Peacetime duties included showing the flag, especially in smaller ports of the Empire, those unlikely to be visited by large warships.\n\nIn the summer of 1931 she was in Newfoundland, then a British dominion, sometimes acting as a yacht to take the Governor around to visit smaller ports. She was on this duty again in 1933 and in 1934 took British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and his daughter up the west coast of Newfoundland to visit the Grenfell Mission at St. Anthony. While a part of the North America and West Indies Squadron in 1933 she visited Prince Edward Island in Canada. There, her then captain, Commander Oswald Cornwallis, his officers and petty officers were entertained by Canadian Senator Creelman MacArthur at his summer home on Foxley River. During her peacetime cruises she was painted in the foreign station colours of white with a buff funnel.\n\n\"Scarborough\" was disarmed and used as a survey ship on the East Indies Station where she arrived in May 1939. On the outbreak of the war in September 1939, she put into Colombo for a refit, where she was rearmed with one quick-firing high-angle gun, suitable against either surface or air targets. During late 1941 and 1942, she carried a 12-pounder (5 kg) quick-firing, high-angle anti-aircraft gun and gradually a number of 20 mm anti-aircraft guns were added. For anti-submarine work, \"Scarborough\" was given 15 depth charges in 1939, later increased to 40, then 80.\n\n\"Scarborough\" was nominated to serve in Home waters on completion of her refit, and after passing through the Red Sea and Mediterranean in December, she arrived at Plymouth in January. She was taken in hand for another refit, before being assigned to the Western Approaches Command. She was attached to the 1st Escort Division at Liverpool for convoy escort in February and deployed on her first patrol on 27 February in company with the destroyers and , and the sloop . They covered the passage of convoy OG-20F to Gibraltar, where \"Scarborough\" and \"Wellington\" arrived in early March. She deployed again with \"Wellington\" and the destroyers , and to escort convoy HG-23 back to Liverpool.\n\nShe continued to escort convoys, through the Irish Sea in and out of Liverpool often in company with other sloops. By mid 1940 she was covering the North Western Approaches. She was soon engaged in escorting convoys bound to and from Canada and North America. In October she sailed to join the inward convoy SC 7, initially as the sole escort for the 35-ship convoy. The convoy had left Sydney, Nova Scotia on 4 October 1940 bound for Liverpool and other British ports. Although vulnerable to air attack, there was no aircraft protection in 1940 for Allied ships in the Atlantic Ocean after leaving coastal regions. The convoy was attacked by a wolfpack of U-boats and suffered heavy losses, despite the arrival on 16 October of the sloop and the corvette as reinforcements. \"Scarborough\" herself came under attack on 17 October by and on 18 October by . The escorts were joined by and , but the U-boats succeeded in sinking 20 merchantmen without loss.\n\n\"Scarborough\" remained deployed on convoy defence into 1941. In the spring of 1941, \"Scarborough\" intercepted and sank two German-manned ex-Norwegian whalers. These had been captured by the in the South Atlantic and were being sent to German occupied Bordeaux with their valuable cargo of whale oil. \"Star XIX\" was of 360 tons displacement and \"Star XXIV\" was of 250 tons displacement.\n\nIn April she was escorting a convoy through the North Western Approaches when she, and detected and depth charged which was forced to the surface and then scuttled. \"Scarborough\" was refitted in August and joined the 43rd Escort Group covering convoys between the UK and Freetown in October. She carried out these duties into 1942. On 16 April she was involved in a collision with . \"Scarborough\" was refitted again in July, which involved the fitting of a new Type 271 radar for surface warning.\n\nAfter completing the refit in October she was nominated to support the planned landings in North Africa (Operation Torch). She deployed out of Gibraltar escorting convoys for the rest of the year, moving to the western Mediterranean in January. She returned to the UK in February and was deployed with the 39th Escort Group. On 7 February 1943 \"Scarborough\" was part of the escort of Convoy MJS-7 when three of its merchant ships hit mines west of Gibraltar that had been laid by a German submarine on 1 and 2 February 1943. \"Empire Mordred\" sank taking 12 crew and 3 gunners down with her, but HMS \"Scarborough\" rescued the master, 41 crew and 13 gunners. She landed them safely in Liverpool. The rest of the year was spent escorting Atlantic convoys. \"Scarborough\" was transferred to the 15th Escort Group at based in Belfast in January 1944.\n\nIn May she was assigned to support the Allied landings in Normandy on D Day in June 1944. \"Scarborough\" was to follow closely behind British minesweepers and Trinity House vessels which were making a path through the German minefields near the coast of Normandy. She dropped buoys to mark the clear path for the assault convoys. On 7 June she was re-deployed for duty as a control ship for Coastal Forces craft. She returned to Portsmouth in July and was then paid off at Hartlepool and reduced to the reserve. She spent the rest of the war laid up.\n\nAfter the end of the war \"Scarborough\" was placed on the disposal list and sold to BISCO on 3 June 1949. She was towed to Thornaby-on-Tees and arrived at the breakers yard on 3 July, where she was scrapped.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2207272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207272", "title": "Farther Along (The Byrds album)", "text": "Farther Along (The Byrds album)\n\nFarther Along is the eleventh album by the American rock band the Byrds and was released in November 1971 on Columbia Records (\"see\" 1971 in music). For the most part, the album was recorded and produced by the Byrds themselves in London, England, over the course of five work-intensive days in July 1971. It was quickly released as a reaction to the commercial failure of the Byrds' previous album, \"Byrdmaniax\", and as an attempt to stem the criticism that album was receiving in the music press.\n\n\"Byrdmaniax\" had featured a large amount of orchestration, which producer Terry Melcher had applied to the album, allegedly without the band's consent. The band were unhappy with this and \"Farther Along\" was intended as their answer to what they perceived as Melcher's over-production, as well as an attempt to prove that they could produce an album that they regarded as superior to \"Byrdmaniax\" themselves. Band biographer Johnny Rogan has suggested that the rapidity with which the Byrds planned and recorded \"Farther Along\" resulted in an LP that the band themselves were unhappy with and that failed to undo the damage to their reputation inflicted by \"Byrdmaniax\".\n\nUpon release, the album only managed to reach number 152 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart and failed to break into the UK Albums Chart altogether. A single taken from the album, \"America's Great National Pastime\", was released on November 29, 1971, but failed to chart in the United States or in the United Kingdom. \"Farther Along\" has the dubious honor of tying with \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" as the Byrds' album to have spent the least amount of time on the \"Billboard\" album chart. In addition, it was almost the lowest charting album of The Byrds' career in America, being beaten only by \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\", which charted at number 153.\n\nFollowing the release of the \"Byrdmaniax\" album, the Byrds' producer and manager, Terry Melcher, resigned amid accusations of overdubbing strings, horns, and a gospel choir onto that album without the band's consent. The Byrds' annoyance over Melcher's additions to \"Byrdmaniax\" prompted them to try to rectify the situation by quickly recording a new album, this time produced by themselves. Despite a heavy touring schedule—resulting from the band being an in-demand fixture on the live concert circuit—the Byrds were eager to release another studio album as soon as possible.\n\nUpon arriving in England for an appearance at the Lincoln Folk Festival on July 24, 1971, the Byrds booked into a London recording studio with engineer Mike Ross to record their next album. The band's decision to produce the album themselves was almost certainly an attempt to show Melcher that they could do a better job than he had done on \"Byrdmaniax\". During five days of recording between July 22 and July 28, 1971, the Byrds recorded all eleven songs that would appear on \"Farther Along\", with no other songs known to have been attempted by the band during the sessions. The tapes were then brought back to the U.S., where they were mixed by Eric Prestidge at Columbia Studios, Hollywood in August 1971, with the song \"Bugler\" receiving additional Mandolin and lead vocal overdubs from the band's lead guitarist, Clarence White.\n\nOverall, \"Farther Along\" had a much less cluttered sound than its predecessor, as guitarist and band leader Roger McGuinn told journalist David Fricke in 2000: \"It was as live as you can get in the studio. We didn't do a lot of overdubs, mostly just the vocals.\" Nonetheless, while the album succeeded in countering the over-production present on \"Byrdmaniax\", the band themselves weren't particularly satisfied with the finished product. In a 1997 interview, bass player Skip Battin expressed his dissatisfaction with the album by saying \"When we finished it, I didn't think we had anything, I thought the stuff was rotten - it didn't sound good, it was scattered and there was no unification.\" Drummer Gene Parsons concurred with Battin's assessment of the album, stating \"I felt that \"Farther Along\" was a good album, but it was under produced. It was done really rapidly and it suffered in under production as a reaction to \"Byrdmaniax\".\"\n\nThe eleven tracks on \"Farther Along\" included two written by Battin and his songwriting partner, Kim Fowley. The first of these, \"America's Great National Pastime\", was a vaudeville-style novelty song that painted a whimsical picture of life in the US and drew humorous comparisons between the taste of Coca-Cola and cocaine. The second Battin–Fowley song, \"Precious Kate\", was a love song based on a real life incident and was, according to Battin, written in five minutes. Rather than being sung by Battin himself, as most of the Byrds' Battin and Fowley penned songs were, \"Precious Kate\" featured McGuinn on lead vocal. McGuinn himself contributed the song \"Tiffany Queen\", a rousing, Chuck Berry-influenced track with amusing, Dylanesque lyrics, inspired by his third wife Linda Gilbert.\nThe album also included the Larry Murray song \"Bugler\" which was sung by Clarence White and was regarded by most critics as the album's highlight, as well as one of White's best vocal performances. The moving tale of a boy and his dog, which turns tragic when the dog is killed in a road accident, took on a deeper meaning when White himself was killed by a drunken driver in 1973. \"Bugler\" was the third in a trio of Byrds' songs about canine companions, with the first being \"Old Blue\" on \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" and the second being \"Fido\" on \"Ballad of Easy Rider\". White was also responsible for arranging the album's title track, the bluegrass standard \"Farther Along\", a song that had crossed-over to a rock audience in 1970 when it had appeared on The Flying Burrito Brothers' second album, \"Burrito Deluxe\". The Byrds' recording of the song became more poignant in the years following its release, after \"Farther Along\" was sung by ex-Byrd Gram Parsons and then-current member of the Eagles, Bernie Leadon, at White's funeral in 1973.\n\nThe Byrds' drummer, Gene Parsons (no relation to Gram), contributed two songs to the album: \"Get Down Your Line\", a reflection on the need for self-improvement, and \"B.B. Class Road\", a lighthearted song about a road manager's life on tour with a rock band, co-written by the Byrds' roadie, Stuart \"Dinky\" Dawson. For many years it was assumed that the lead vocal on \"B.B. Class Road\" was sung by Dawson himself, but Parsons eventually revealed in the early 1990s that it was actually him singing on the track. Parsons went on to elucidate by stating \"I wanted Dinky to sing this song but Dinky insisted that I do it. Until now, everyone thought he did. I tried to sing it with an excess of testosterone in the true spirit of rock 'n roll.\" Parsons further explained to the Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan in 1997 \"I was imitating and taking on a different persona. Stuart and I collaborated and it's me growling and howling out the vocal.\"\n\n\"Antique Sandy\" was the result of a songwriting experiment between all four members of the Byrds and their percussionist/road manager Jimmi Seiter. The song's inspiration was Seiter's then girlfriend, who did indeed live in the woods in a house full of antiques, as the song's lyrics indicate. The Bob Rafkin-penned \"Lazy Waters\" featured a melodramatic lead vocal from Battin, which was enhanced during the song's refrain by the Byrds' trademark crystal clear harmonies. Despite being a cover, the song's wistful yearning for the simpler days of a bucolic childhood had personal significance for Battin, as he explained during a 1979 interview: \"'Lazy Waters' was a serious song. I was living in the Mendocino woods and working on the road. I'd known the song a long time. It expressed my feelings about life in the country and life on the road.\" The band also elected to cover The Fiestas' 1959 hit single \"So Fine\" on the album, at the suggestion of Clarence White. The addition of \"So Fine\", along with other rock 'n' roll-influenced songs, such as \"Tiffany Queen\", \"Get Down Your Line\", and \"B.B. Class Road\", provided the album with a 1950s-flavored thematic unity. The final track on \"Farther Along\" was a Gene Parsons and Clarence White-penned bluegrass instrumental titled \"Bristol Steam Convention Blues\". The song had been inspired by Parsons' frustration and disappointment at having narrowly missed the Bristol Steam Convention during both of the Byrds' last two visits to England.\n\n\"Farther Along\" was released on November 17, 1971 in the United States (catalogue item KC 30150) and January 21, 1972 in the United Kingdom (catalogue item S 64676), less than five months after \"Byrdmaniax\". Although the album was issued in stereo commercially, there is some evidence to suggest that mono copies of the album (possibly radio station promos) were distributed in the UK. The album peaked at number 152 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart, during a chart stay of seven weeks, but failed to break into the UK Albums Chart. In the U.S., the album was almost the lowest charting of the Byrds' career, being beaten only by \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\", which had charted at number 153 during 1969. A single taken from the album, \"America's Great National Pastime\" b/w \"Farther Along\", was released on November 29, 1971 but failed to chart in the United States or in the United Kingdom. The single's failure in the UK was due to its being withdrawn by CBS Records shortly after its release in January 1972.\n\nReaction to the album in the U.S. was more enthusiastic than it had been for \"Byrdmaniax\" but still wasn't wholly positive. Andy Mellen, reviewing the album in the \"Winnipeg Free Press\" in February 1972, wrote, \"[While] not being anywhere the equal of \"Younger Than Yesterday\" or even \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\", it is an encouraging LP, offering some assurance that Roger McGuinn and friends still have their fingers on the pulse of what's happening musically in 1972.\" Ben Gerson commented on both the band and the album in the March 1972 issue of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine: \"There is a programmatic certainty to their music at this point which at first glance happily signifies that a first-generation band has successfully remade itself, but, after repeated exposure disappoints one with its inflexibility.\" Gerson concluded his review of \"Farther Along\" by commenting \"This is not an outstanding album, either by Byrds or contemporary standards, though, for at least a Byrds fan, it contains several seductive tunes and some exemplary musicianship. But beneath the old Byrds sound, and this new, quartered approach, there is a more fundamental commitment, and that is to survival.\" The question of the Byrds' continued existence was also echoed in a contemporary review by Bud Scoppa in the March 1972 edition of \"Rock\" magazine, in which he remarked: \"The Byrds recognized their failure on \"Byrdmaniax\", but placed the blame on the lavish production job rather than their own disunity. So what we have with \"Farther Along\", evidently rushed out to rectify the problems caused by the last LP, is more disunity, but this time in a basic unadorned state.\"\n\nIn the UK, \"Farther Along\" received reasonable reviews in the music press, with many commentators expressing pleasure that the band had reverted to a more simplistic style of production. The January 29, 1972 edition of \"Melody Maker\" commented that it was \"Good to hear the Byrds stretching their wings again\" before concluding that \"\"Byrdmaniax\" was the bad news - now for the good news.\" Caroline Boucher, writing in \"Disc\" magazine, awarded the album three stars out of four, while Lon Goddard's review in \"Record Mirror\" stated that the album showed the Byrds \"slowly drifting away from the more apparent country influences that came to the fore with \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\" and combining into a hybrid that features more of the approach utilised on their earlier albums.\"\n\nIn more recent years, Mark Deming of the Allmusic website has described the album's contents as a \"well-crafted set\" and compared it to \"Byrdmaniax\" by stating \"It's certainly a significant improvement, but something short of a triumphant return; the band sounds a bit tired in spots, as if they were starting to run out of gas.\" In his 2000 review for \"The Austin Chronicle\", Raoul Hernandez gave the album a rating of three and a half stars out of five, commenting \"its authentic Dylan and the Band feel solidifies its status as further blueprint of today's roots-rock revival.\" \"Rolling Stone\" senior editor David Fricke described the album favorably in 2000 as \"a warm, fine record: a rustic, intimate surprise still rarely appreciated for its quiet nobility and winning performances.\"\n\nFollowing the release of the album, the Byrds continued to tour the U.S. and Europe throughout 1972, but no new LP or single release was forthcoming and ultimately, \"Farther Along\" would turn out to be the last studio album by the McGuinn, White, Parsons, and Battin line-up of the band. The Byrds did, however, record a handful of new songs during 1972 but these remained unreleased at the time. Included among these new songs were versions of David Wiffen's \"Lost My Drivin' Wheel\" and McGuinn's own \"Born to Rock and Roll\", recorded on January 12 and April 18, 1972 respectively. \"Born to Rock and Roll\" was intended for a proposed single release, most likely with \"Lost My Drivin' Wheel\" as the B-side, but ultimately the single failed to materialize. According to McGuinn, the January 12, 1972 session that produced \"Lost My Drivin' Wheel\" saw the guitarist being backed, not by the Byrds, but by hired studio musicians. However, since McGuinn was contracted to Columbia Records as a member of the band and not as a solo artist, the studio documentation for this session lists \"Lost My Drivin' Wheel\" as a Byrds' recording.\n\nIn July 1972, Gene Parsons was fired from the group and replaced by session drummer John Guerin, although Guerin was never officially a fully fledged member of the Byrds and instead worked for a standard session musician's rate. Following Parsons' dismissal, a further three songs (\"Draggin'\", \"I'm So Restless\", and \"Bag Full of Money\") were taped by the band at Wally Heider Studios in Los Angeles during July 1972. Ultimately, the five songs recorded by the Byrds throughout 1972 would all be re-recorded for McGuinn's debut solo album, \"Roger McGuinn\", with the exception of \"Born to Rock and Roll\", which was re-recorded for the Byrds' 1973 reunion album, \"Byrds\". McGuinn did, however, re-record the song for his 1975 solo album, \"Roger McGuinn & Band\".\n\nIn January 1973, the band taped a cover version of \"Roll Over Beethoven\" and a re-recording of their signature song, Bob Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", for the soundtrack to \"Banjoman\", an Earl Scruggs tribute film in which they also starred. Bass player Skip Battin was fired soon after and in late February 1973, McGuinn finally disbanded the latter-day line-up of the Byrds in order to facilitate a reunion of the five original members of the group. The Byrds' reunion was centered around the release of a comeback album in March 1973 and featured McGuinn, along with original band members David Crosby, Gene Clark, Chris Hillman, and Michael Clarke.\n\n\"Farther Along\" was remastered at 20-bit resolution as part of the Columbia/Legacy Byrds series. It was reissued in an expanded form on February 22, 2000 with the addition of three bonus tracks. These bonus tracks were all taken from the Byrds' early to mid-1972 studio sessions and included \"Lost My Drivin' Wheel\", \"Born to Rock and Roll\" and \"Bag Full of Money\". The remastered reissue also includes, as a hidden track, an alternate version of \"Bristol Steam Convention Blues\".\n\n\n\nSources for this section are as follows:\n\nThe Byrds\n\nNote: Bonus track 12 is a recording not by the Byrds, but by Roger McGuinn and a group of unknown studio musicians. Bonus track 13 features the regular band line-up plus Charles Lloyd (saxophone), an unknown musician (synthesizer), and a number of unnamed female backing singers. Bonus track 14 features McGuinn, White and Battin, along with John Guerin (drums), Buddy Emmons (pedal steel guitar), and an unknown musician (piano).\n\n\n"}

The space under the keyboard was enclosed, a knee-hold being left in which were two pedals used to set in rotation a large wooden cylinder fixed just behind the keyboard over the levers, and covered with a roll-top similar to those of modern office desks. The cylinder (in some specimens covered with chamois leather) tapered towards the treble-end. When a key was depressed, a little tongue of wood, one end of which stopped the string, was pressed against the revolving cylinder, and the vibrations produced by friction were transmitted to the string and reinforced as in the piano and violin by the soundboard. The adjustment of the parts and the velocity of the cylinder required delicacy and great nicety, for if the little wooden tongues rested too lightly upon the cylinder or the strings, harmonics were produced, and the note jumped to the octave or twelfth.\nSometimes when chords were played the touch became so heavy that two performers were required, as in the early medieval organistrum, the prototype of the harmonichord. Carl Maria von Weber must have had some opinion of the possibilities of the harmonichord, which in tone resembled the glass harmonica, since he composed a concerto with orchestral accompaniment for the instrument.\n"}

He became famous for playing the lead role of San Te in \"The 36th Chamber of Shaolin\" (1978) and its sequels. He later became known for his two roles in Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill\" films: Johnny Mo, the leader of the Crazy 88 Yakuza gang in \"\" (2003); and kung fu master Pai Mei in \"\" (2004).\n\nHe was born Sin Kam-hei in Guangdong Province, China in August 22, 1951, prior to his adoption into another family. Liu is often wrongly cited as being the adopted son of Lau Cham, and adoptive brother of famed directors / actors Lau Kar-leung (Liu Chia-liang) and Lau Kar-wing (Liu Chia-Yung). In fact, he was not adopted by the Lau brothers' family, he is actually just Lau Cham's godson.\n\nIn his youth, he skipped school to train in Chinese martial arts without his parents' knowledge. He trained at Lau Cham's martial arts school of Hung Gar discipline, which descended from Wong Fei-hung's grand student (father to Lau Kar Leung). Lau Cham's wife assisted in his training and due to the friendship and respect he felt for his sifu (master/teacher) and his wife, he took on the name Lau Ka-fai. As he grew up, he found a job as a shipping clerk to make ends meet. His interests had always been towards martial arts and he was eventually offered a role by Lau Kar-leung.\n\nLiu’s first break was with Chang's Film Company (a Shaw Brothers subsidiary operating in Taiwan) acting small parts for such films as \"5 Shaolin Masters\", \"Shaolin Martial Arts\", and \"4 Assassins\". He starred in \"Challenge of the Masters\" (1976), as the folk hero Wong Fei Hung, and was featured in \"Executioners From Shaolin\" (1977) before starring in his signature role as Shaolin hero San Te in \"The 36th Chamber of Shaolin\".\n\nThe tale of the imperialistic struggle, while not a new one, was significant for the intense focus placed on the inner workings of Shaolin Temple itself. San Te, Liu’s character, overcomes the temple's thirty-five chambers as he unwittingly undergoes the rigorous training regime imposed by the temple’s Head Abbott on the pretext of “earning” a right to study martial arts there.\n\nThe “zero-to-hero” tale turned Liu into an international icon in spite of a frame far slighter than that of the folk hero himself (known as “Iron Arms” for the muscularity of his physique) and paved the way for a very healthy working schedule into the mid-1990s, even as younger, more agile martial artists eventually emerged. By the late 1980s he had begun accepting smaller roles, such as in Lau Kar-leung's \"Tiger on the Beat\".\n\nLiu has also been active in television, and was contracted to Hong Kong's TVB company for many years, continuing playing roles as a martial arts master. Though still performing some martial arts roles, he is at home as well in comedic, self-deprecatory or emotional characters. His second-most common role in TVB has been playing a Hong Kong Police Force officer.\n\nQuentin Tarantino has long been a fan of Liu, and had one day hoped to find him a role in one of his movies. This eventually came to pass with the roles of Johnny Mo and Master Pai Mei in both \"Kill Bill\" films (incidentally, in one version of the script for the second film, Liu's lips would be speaking Cantonese while his voice, dubbed by Tarantino, would be in English — imitating a bad dub job). His roles in \"Kill Bill\" raised Liu's profile again and a renewed interest was shown by Chinese producers; since \"Kill Bill\", Liu has returned to doing movies while continuing to do television for Hong Kong's TVB station.\n\nIn 2008, Liu added a Bollywood film to his profile. Collaborating with Indian actor Akshay Kumar who is a top-billed Bollywood actor and also a martial arts performer in a film titled \"Chandni Chowk To China\" \"(CC2C)\". He played the role of the villain, Hojo, a smuggler and a well-trained martial artist. Before this, he appeared as himself (along with his mentor Lau Kar Leung) in the 2009 film \"Dragonland\", the first Italian documentary about martial cinema history, by Lorenzo De Luca. Liu attended as special guest star at the premiere in Rome, meeting his Italian fans for the first time. During August 2011, Liu had a stroke and put all his plans on hold to recover. Liu had cancelled all public engagements as of March 2012.\n\nLiu has been married twice. He has two daughters, Angie and Bonnie, from his first marriage which ended in 1986, and a son Kris () and daughter Sonia () from his second marriage with Ma Fei-feng () of Thai-descent which ended in 2009.\n\nIn August 2011, while in \"To Kwa Wan\" performing with his band, Liu had a stroke and hit his head. He had partial right-sided paralysis and a speech impairment as a consequence of the stroke; he talks with a slur and needs a wheelchair to travel. To complicate matters, his estranged family (from his second marriage) had begun pressuring him for money. Depressed at his physical state and family complications, he isolated himself in a nursing home. In June 2012, Liu decided to divorce his second wife and focus on his recovery.\n\nDuring his medical crisis, Liu entrusted his assets to his assistant and spokesperson, Eva Fung. However, the two had a falling out, and Fung refused to return his assets. Because of the mounting medical expenses, Gordon's finances were thin and needed the remainder of his assets to sustain him. Liu attempted to settle the matter in court against Fung. She reluctantly accepted the subpoena. By April 29, 2014, just a day before the court date, Fung agreed to return Liu's assets with interest. Subsequently, Liu arranged for actress Amy Fan to become the legal guardian of his assets; Fan has assisted Liu with managing his affairs as he has physical limitations because of his health. In 2015, it was reported that he no longer spoke with a slur but continued to use a wheelchair, and that he had resided at a nursing home for several years.\n\n\n"}

Suryavarman usurped King Udayadityavarman I, defeating his armies in approximately 1002. After a protracted war with Udayadityavarman's would-be successor, Jayavarman V, Suryavarman I claimed the throne in 1010. Suryavarman was a Mahayana Buddhist who was also tolerant of the growing Theravada Buddhist presence in the Khmer kingdom.\n\nSuryavarman I established diplomatic relations with the Chola dynasty of south India (Tamilnadu) around 1012. Suryavarman I sent a chariot as a present to the Chola Emperor Rajaraja Chola I. It seems that the Khmer king Suryavarman I requested aid from the powerful Chola Emperor Rajendra Chola against Tambralinga kingdom . After learning of Suryavarman's alliance with Rajendra Chola, the Tambralinga kingdom requested aid from the Srivijaya king Sangrama Vijayatungavarman. This eventually led to the Chola Empire coming into conflict with the Srivijiya Empire. The war ended with a victory for the Chola dynasty and Angkor Wat of the Khmer Empire, and major losses for the Sri Vijaya Empire and the Tambralinga kingdom.\n\nHis reign lasted some 40 years and he spent much of that time defending it. Known as the \"King of the Just Laws,\" he consolidated his political power by inviting some four thousand local officials to the royal palace and swear an oath of allegiance to him. Suryavarman I favored Buddhism but he allowed the people to continue practising Hinduism. His palace was situated in the vicinity of Angkor Thom, and he was the first of the Khmers rulers to protect his palace with a wall.\n\nSuryavarman I expanded his territory to the west to Lopburi, including the Menam basin in Thailand, and east into the Mekong basin.\n\nSuryavarman probably started construction at Preah Khan Kompong Svay, and expanded Banteay Srei, Wat Ek Phnom, and Phnom Chisor. The major constructions built by this king were the Prasat Preah Vihear, on Dangrek Mountain, and completion of the Phimeanakas and Ta Keo. Suryavarman I also started the second Angkor reservoir, the West Baray, which is 8 km long and 2.1 km wide. It held more than 123 million liters of water. This is the largest Khmer reservoir that survives. There is some indication that Suryavarman I sent a gift to Rajendra Chola I the Emperor of the Chola Empire to possibly facilitate trade.\n\nSuryavarman I died in 1050 and was given the posthumous title \"Nirvanapada\" (\"the king who has gone to nirvana\"), a nod to his Buddhist beliefs. He was succeeded by his sons, Udayadityavarman II, who died around 1066 and Harshavarman III (Sadasivapada). The latter continued the struggle against internal rebellions and fought back assaults from the Chams until his death in 1080.\n\n\n"}

It is found in urine and is formed from the combination of benzoic acid and glycine. Levels of hippuric acid rise with the consumption of phenolic compounds (such as fruit juice, tea and wine). The phenols are first converted to benzoic acid, and then to hippuric acid and excreted in urine.\n\nHippuric acid crystallizes in rhombic prisms which are readily soluble in hot water, melt at 187 °C, and decompose at about 240 °C. High concentrations of hippuric acid may also indicate a toluene intoxication; however, scientists have called this correlation into question because there are other variables that affect levels of hippuric acid. When many aromatic compounds such as benzoic acid and toluene are taken internally, they are converted to hippuric acid by reaction with the amino acid, glycine.\n\nA modern synthesis of hippuric acid involves the acylation of glycine with benzoyl chloride:\n\nBiochemically, hippuric acid is produced from benzoic acid by direct glycine acylation. It is one of the two conjugates of benzoic acid produced metabolically, the other being the glucuronide. Both are eliminated from the body in urine. Benzoic acid is introduced into the body by ingestion (sodium benzoate is used as a preservative) and by hydrolysis of pharmaceutical agents such as benzyl benzoate.\n\nHippuric acid is readily hydrolysed by hot caustic alkalis to benzoic acid and glycine. Nitrous acid converts it into benzoyl glycolic acid, CHC(=O)OCHCOH. Its ethyl ester reacts with hydrazine to form hippuryl hydrazine, CHCONHCHCONHNH, which was used by Theodor Curtius for the preparation of hydrazoic acid.\n\nJustus von Liebig showed in 1829 that hippuric acid differed from benzoic acid and he named it, and in 1834 he determined its constitution, while in 1853 French chemist Victor Dessaignes (1800–1885) synthesized it by the action of benzoyl chloride on the zinc salt of glycine. It was also formed by heating benzoic anhydride with glycine, and by heating benzamide with monochloroacetic acid.\n\n"}

The eldest brother, Sir Robert Talbot, 2nd Baronet, had held a high commission under James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde in the army in Ireland and was reckoned among the king's most confidential advisers. A younger brother, Richard Talbot, later Earl of Tyrconnel, was also devoted to the cause of the exiled monarch and stood high in royal favour.\n\nPeter Talbot himself was constantly in attendance on Charles II, and his court. On account of his knowledge of the continental languages, he was repeatedly dispatched on private embassies to Lisbon, Madrid, and Paris. On the return of the king to London, Talbot received an appointment as Queen's Almoner, but the Clarendon and Ormond faction, which was then predominant, feared his influence with the king. He was accused of conspiring with the aid of four Jesuits to assassinate the Duke of Ormond, and he was forced to seek safety by resigning his position at Court and retiring to the Continent. The king allowed him a pension of three hundred pounds a year. Before his return to England, Talbot had, with the approval of the General of the Jesuits, severed his connection with the Society. He was appointed Archbishop of Dublin on 11 January 1669, and was consecrated at Antwerp, assisted by the Bishops of Ghent and Ferns.\n\nDuring this period, the English treatment of Catholics in Ireland was more lenient than usual, owing to the known sympathies of the King (who entered the Catholic Church on his deathbed). In August 1670, Talbot held his first Diocesan Synod in Dublin. It was opened with High Mass, which for forty years many of the faithful had not witnessed. In the same year an assembly of the archbishops and bishops and representatives of the clergy was held in Dublin. At this assembly the question of precedence and of the primatial authority gave rise to considerable discussion and led to an embittered controversy between the Archbishop of Dublin and Oliver Plunkett, Archbishop of Armagh. The subject had been one of great controversy in the Middle Ages, but had been in abeyance for some time. Both prelates considered that they were asserting the rights of their respective sees, and each published a treatise on the subject. Another meeting of the Catholic gentry was convened by Talbot, at which it was resolved to send to the Court at London a representative who would seek redress for some of the grievances to which the Catholics of Ireland were subjected. This alarmed the Protestants in Ireland, who feared that the balance of power might shift to the Catholic majority. They protested to King Charles, and in 1673 some of the repressive measures against Irish Catholics were reinstated, and Talbot was compelled to seek safety in exile.\n\nDuring his banishment he resided generally in Paris. In 1675, Talbot, in poor health, obtained permission to return to England, and for two years he resided with a family friend at Poole Hall in Cheshire. Towards the close of 1677, he petitioned the Crown for leave \"to come to Ireland to die in his own country\", and through the influence of James, Duke of York his request was granted. Shortly after that the Popish Plot was hatched by Titus Oates, and information was forwarded to James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, to the effect that a rebellion was being planned in Ireland, that Peter Talbot was one of the accomplices, and that assassins had been hired to murder the Duke himself. Ormonde was in private deeply sceptical about the existence of the Plot, remarking of the alleged assassins that they were such \"silly drunken vagabonds\" that \"no schoolboy would trust them to rob an orchard\"; but he thought it politically unwise to show his doubts publicly. Though he was sympathetic to Oliver Plunkett, who was also arrested in connection with the alleged Plot and was later to die on the scaffold, he had always been hostile to Talbot.\n\nOn 8 October 1678, Ormonde signed a warrant for the archbishop's arrest. He was arrested near Maynooth at the house of his brother, Colonel Richard Talbot, and was then moved to Dublin. For two years Talbot remained in prison, where he fell ill. Despite their long friendship, Charles II, fearful of the political repercussions, made no effort to save him. He died in prison at the beginning of November 1680.\n\nTalbot is said to have been interred in the churchyard of St. Audoen's Church, close by the tomb of Rowland FitzEustace, 1st Baron Portlester. From his prison cell Talbot had written on 12 April 1679, petitioning that a priest be allowed to visit him, as he was bedridden for months and was now in imminent danger of death. The petition was refused, but Oliver Plunkett was a prisoner in an adjoining cell, and on hearing of Talbot's dying condition forced his way through the warders and administered to the dying prelate the last consolations of the sacraments.\n\n\nAttribution\n"}

It originates in Varusanadu Hills, the Periyar Plateau of the Western Ghats range, and flows northeast through the Kambam Valley, which lies between the Palni Hills to the north and the Varushanad Hills to the south. The Vattaparai Falls are located on this river. As it rounds the eastern corner of the Varushanad Hills, the river turns southeast, running through the region of Pandya Nadu. Madurai, the largest city in the Pandya Nadu region and its ancient capital, lies on the Vaigai. The river empties into the Palk Strait near Uchipuli, close to Pamban bridge in Ramanathapuram District.\n\nThe Vaigai is long, with a drainage basin large.\n\nSangam literature (circa 300 B.C) has paid many tributes to Vaigai, extolling it as 'the river that brings water when one touches it', viz the etymology Vai (place your) + gai (hands) = place one's hands. The following story is told about the birth of the river Vaigai etc. Meenakshi, the daughter of a Pandyan king, was an incarnation of Parvati. From a very young age, she made up her mind to marry Lord Shiva and none else. Her family was initially against this but eventually consented to her wish and arranged the wedding. Sundareswara (Siva), being an ascetic, came to the wedding without any family or relatives accompanying him. Disappointed at this, the Pandyan king angrily showed Siva the huge amount of food prepared for the bridegroom's relatives. Siva pointed to a friend he had brought with him saying 'He will consume all the food that you've made'. This friend was a Rakshasa named Kundodhara. After Kundodhara finished all the food that was prepared, He became very thirsty and started asking for water. All the wells and canals in Madurai were not sufficient to quench his thirst. Then, Siva asked Kundodhara to put his hand out and opened a small part of his hair lock and Ganga began to flow into his hand. After quenching his thirst, The rest of the waters began flowing in Madurai as the Vaigai river. Vaigai means 'put your hand out' in Tamil.\nSrimad Bhagavatam,the Sanskrit sacred text dedicated to Lord Vishnu mentions the Vaigai river as 'Kritimala' meaning 'the sacred garland of the act (of providing water)'It is said that Lord Vishnu gave the river a garland for precious act of providing water and eliminating the thirst of Sage Agastya .However,presently,the title mainly refers to the river's tributary Kirthimaalai.\n\nThe main tributaries of the river Vaigai are, the river Suruliyaru, the river Mullaiyaaru, the river Varaganadi, the river Manjalaru, river kottagudi and river Kridhumaal. All these rivers, except Kridhumaal join with the great Vaigai river nearer to the places around the Vaigai Dam which is situated in Theni district, whereas Kridhumaal joins Vaigai in Madurai.\n\nVaigai gets major feed from the Periyar Dam in Kumuli, Kerala. Water from the Periyar River in Kerala is diverted into the Vaigai River in Tamil Nadu via a tunnel through the Western Ghats. In summers, the Vaigai river ends up dry very often. The water never reaches Madurai, let alone flowing into places past Madurai.\n\nThe Vaigai Dam is built across the river in Periyakulam Taluk, in the Theni district of Tamil Nadu. It provides water for irrigation for the Madurai district and the Dindigul district as well as drinking water to Madurai and Andipatti. Near the dam, the Government of Tamil Nadu has constructed an Agricultural Research Station for researching the growing of a variety of crops, including rice, sorghum, blackgram, cowpea and cotton.\n\nThe Periyar Dam was built in 1895 by John Pennycuick, who implemented a plan proposed over a century earlier by Pradani Muthirulappa Pillai of Ramnad. The dam was built by the British Army Engineering corps for the Travancore kingdom. The first dam was washed away by floods, and a second masonry dam was constructed in 1895.\n\n\"Greater than the mother bearing child/Greater than the child that is born/Every breath is Periyar/Every word is Periyar/In every place, in all the world/As far as Periyar water flows/Your name will stand-Pennycuick-your name/Though written on water, will always stand\".\n\nThat is how Anthony Muthu Pillai (1863–1929) had paid tributes in Tamil to John Pennycuick, the engineer who had taken up the \"audacious and unprecedented feat of...engineering\" for transferring some water from the Periyar river in Travancore State to the Vaigai basin in Madras Presidency.\n\n"}

{"id": "2207417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207417", "title": "Boston Blackie", "text": "Boston Blackie\n\nBoston Blackie is a fictional character created by author Jack Boyle (October 19, 1881 – October 1928). Blackie, a jewel thief and safecracker in Boyle's stories, became a detective in adaptations for films, radio and television—an \"enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.\"\n\nActor Chester Morris was the best-known Blackie, playing the character in 14 Columbia Pictures films (1941–1949) and in a 1944 NBC radio series. Boston Blackie is the role for which Morris is best remembered.\n\nWriter Jack Boyle grew up in Chicago, Illinois. While working as a newspaper reporter in San Francisco, he became an opium addict, was drawn into crime, and was jailed for writing bad checks. Later convicted of robbery, Boyle was serving a term in San Quentin when he created the character of Boston Blackie. The first four stories appeared in \"The American Magazine\" in 1914, with Boyle writing under the pen name \"No. 6066\". From 1917 to 1919, Boston Blackie stories appeared in \"The Red Book\" magazine, and from 1918 they were adapted for motion pictures.\n\nWhen Boston Blackie began to find success on the screen, Boyle edited the \"Red Book\" magazine stories into a book, \"Boston Blackie\" (1919). He revised and rearranged the order of the stories to create a cohesive narrative—a common practice at the time. This was the only appearance of Boston Blackie in book form, but his adventures continued to appear in periodicals.\n\nThe earliest Boston Blackie film adaptations were silent, dating from 1918 to 1927. Columbia Pictures revived the property in 1941 with \"Meet Boston Blackie\", a fast, 58-minute B movie starring Chester Morris. Although the running time was brief, Columbia gave the picture good production values and an imaginative director, Robert Florey. The film was successful, and a series followed.\n\nIn the Columbia features, Boston Blackie is a reformed jewel thief who is always suspected when a daring crime is committed. In order to clear himself, he investigates personally and brings the actual culprit to justice, sometimes using disguises. An undercurrent of comedy runs throughout the action/detective series.\n\nIn one of these films, \"After Midnight with Boston Blackie\", the character's real name was revealed to be Horatio Black.\n\nMorris gave the Blackie character his own personal charm: he could be light and flippant or stern and dangerous, as the situation demanded. His sidekick, the Runt, was always on hand to help his old friend. George E. Stone played Runt in all but the first and last films. Charles Wagenheim and Sid Tomack, respectively, substituted for Stone when he was not available.\n\nBlackie's friendly adversaries were Inspector Farraday of the police (played in all the films and the radio series by Richard Lane) and his assistant, Sergeant Matthews. Matthews was originally played as a hapless victim of circumstance by Walter Sande; he was replaced by Lyle Latell, who played it dumber, and then by comedian Frank Sully, who played it even dumber.\n\nBlackie and Runt were often assisted in their endeavors by their friends: the cheerful but easily flustered millionaire Arthur Manleder (almost always played by Lloyd Corrigan; Harry Hayden and Harrison Greene each played the role once), and the streetwise pawnbroker Jumbo Madigan (played by Cy Kendall or Joseph Crehan). A variety of actresses including Rochelle Hudson, Harriet Hilliard, Adele Mara and Ann Savage took turns playing various gal-Friday characters.\n\nThe films are highly typical of Columbia's B movies of the 1940s, with an assortment of veteran character actors (including Clarence Muse, Marvin Miller, George Lloyd, Byron Foulger), new faces on the way up (Larry Parks, Dorothy Malone, Nina Foch, Forrest Tucker, Lloyd Bridges) and stock-company players familiar from Columbia's features, serials, and short subjects (Kenneth MacDonald, George McKay, Eddie Laughton, John Tyrrell). The series was also a useful training ground for promising directors, including Edward Dmytryk, Oscar Boetticher, William Castle, and finally Seymour Friedman, who went on to work prolifically in Columbia's television department. The Boston Blackie series ran until 1949.\n\nConcurrent with the Columbia Pictures films, a \"Boston Blackie\" radio series—also starring Chester Morris—aired on NBC June 23 – September 15, 1944, as a summer replacement for \"Amos 'n' Andy\". Lesley Woods played Blackie's girlfriend Mary Wesley; Richard Lane played Inspector Farraday. Harlow Wilcox was the announcer for the 30-minute program.\n\nA new incarnation of the \"Boston Blackie\" radio series aired April 11, 1945 – October 25, 1950, starring Richard Kollmar. Maurice Tarplin played Inspector Farraday; Jan Miner was Mary. More than 200 half-hour episodes were transcribed and syndicated by Frederick Ziv to Mutual and other network outlets.\n\nKent Taylor starred in the Ziv-produced half-hour TV series \"The Adventures of Boston Blackie\". Syndicated in September 1951, it ran for 58 episodes, lasting until 1953, continuing in repeats over the following decade. Lois Collier appeared as Mary Wesley and Frank Orth was Inspector Farraday. The series was set in Los Angeles; Mary and Blackie had a dog named Whitie, and comedy sometimes took precedence over crime.\n\nTelevision historian Tim Brooks in \"The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946–Present\" described \"Boston Blackie\" as \"a memorable B-grade television series … The term 'B' is used in all the best senses: a certain vitality and sense of humor substituted more than adequately for the normal criteria of expensive production and famous stars.\"\n\nScripter Stefan Petrucha and artist Kirk Van Wormer created the graphic novel \"Boston Blackie\" (Moonstone Books, 2002) with a cover by Tim Seelig. A jewel heist at a costume ball goes horribly wrong, and the five-year-old son of the wealthy Greene family disappears and is presumed dead; the body is never found. The main suspect is Boston Blackie, who is still haunted seven years later by what happened that night. Drawn back into the case, he finds that the truth of what happened that night is awash in a watery grave. A sequel to the graphic novel was published years later.\n\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n\nRadio shows\n"}

It was written by Roger Waters and features David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright sharing the lead vocals, which is the only Floyd song to do so. The song also features a kazoo.\n\nThe Pink Floyd website credits the brass parts to \"The Stanley Myers Orchestra\".\n\nThe song is about a shell-shocked soldier who lost his leg in World War II. He is described as having a medal of \"orange, red and blue\", which may be a reference to the Burma Star. It is the first mention of war in a Pink Floyd song, something that would become a common theme in Roger Waters' lyrics, Roger having lost his father thus in 1944. Waters told \"Mojo\" magazine that this song is autobiographical. He explained: \"Corporal Clegg is about my father and his sacrifice in World War II. It's somewhat sarcastic—the idea of the wooden leg being something you won in the war, like a trophy.\" This can be seen as rather lighter in tone than Pink Floyd's later tackling of the subject, though, despite the irony (Clegg \"won\" his wooden leg in the war) and darkness behind the lyrics; indeed, among the cacophony of voices towards the end we hear an officer telling his one-legged man: \"Clegg! Been meaning to speak to you. About that leg of yours! You're excused parade from now on!\" and members of the band actually corpsing in the chorus. It is possible that the main character got his name after Thaddeus von Clegg, a German clockmaker, who invented the kazoo in the 1840s. The song also marks the first and only lead vocal by drummer Nick Mason on any Pink Floyd album except for his one line vocal in \"One Of These Days.\"\n\nAlthough the song was never performed live, two videos of the song exist. The first one was shot on 19 or 20 February 1968 for Belgian RTB TV's \"Tienerklanken \" show, and features the band miming to a work-in-progress version of the song with a different ending. The second one was shot on 22 July 1969 for the West-German SDR TV and broadcast on 21 September that year. The video takes place in a room with a dining table covered with exquisite food, and all four band members, wearing helmets, officer's caps, and Roger Waters wearing a trench coat, are there enjoying the food. An accidental spillage of wine triggers a full scale food fight, resulting in the room getting completely trashed and all four band members covered in food (even the cameraman gets dragged into it), whilst the Dove of Peace (an actual white dove) is caught in the \"crossfire\". Interspersed throughout the video is footage of war and the band performing the song.\n\nIn a negative review for \"A Saucerful of Secrets\", Jim Miller of \"Rolling Stone\" described \"Corporal Clegg\" as having \"the virtue of brevity, as well as not sounding like it was written in a drugged stupor.\" Continuing, Miller described the song's \"unoriginal melody\" as being \"much too Beatley for these post-\"Sgt. Pepper\" days.\"\n\n\nwith:\n\n\n"}

The component is sometimes called a bottleneck point. The term is metaphorically derived from the neck of a bottle, where the flow speed of the liquid is limited by its neck. \n\nFormally, a bottleneck lies on a system's critical path and provides the lowest throughput. Bottlenecks are usually avoided by system designers, also a great amount of effort is directed at locating and tuning them. Bottleneck may be for example a processor, a communication link, a data processing software, etc.\n\nIn computer programming, tracking down bottlenecks (sometimes known as \"hot spots\" - sections of the code that execute most frequently - i.e. have the highest execution count) is called performance analysis. Reduction is usually achieved with the help of specialized tools, known as performance analyzers or profilers. The objective being to make those particular sections of code perform as fast as possible to improve overall algorithmic efficiency.\n\nIn a communication network, sometimes a max-min fairness of the network is desired, usually opposed to the basic first-come first-served policy. With max-min fairness, data flow between any two nodes is maximized, but only at the cost of \"more or equally expensive\" data flows. To put it another way, in case of network congestion any data flow is only impacted by smaller or equal flows.\n\nIn such context, a \"bottleneck link\" for a given data flow is a link that is fully utilized (is \"saturated\") and of all the flows sharing this link, the given data flow achieves maximum data rate network-wide. Note that this definition is substantially different from a common meaning of a \"bottleneck\". Also note, that this definition does not forbid a single link to be a bottleneck for multiple flows.\n\nA data rate allocation is max-min fair if and only if a data flow between any two nodes has at least one bottleneck link.\n\n"}

In 1934, his first full season with the Yankees, Murphy started 20 games (completing 10); for the remaining 11 years of his major league career, he would start only 20 games more, as he became one of the top bullpen specialists of his day. Moreover, his Yankees were one of the most powerful teams of all time, winning consecutive World Series championships from 1936 to 1939, and again in 1941 and 1943. Murphy's teammates included Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Bill Dickey, Red Ruffing, Lefty Gomez—and, through 1934, Babe Ruth. Murphy spent his final year in the American League with the 1947 Boston Red Sox, the Yankees' arch-rivals.\n\nOverall, he appeared in 415 games, winning 93, losing 53 (for a winning percentage of .637) with an earned run average of 3.50. He led the AL in wins for a relief pitcher seven times. While the save was not then an official statistic, Murphy four times led the AL in that category. In eight World Series games and 16⅓ innings (spread over six different Series), Murphy won two games, lost none, saved four, and posted an ERA of 1.10. Nicknamed \"Fordham Johnny\", \"Fireman\" and \"Grandma\" (either for his rocking-chair pitching motion, or his fastidious nature), Murphy was on seven World Series winning teams, the most of any pitcher in history.\n\nWhen his playing days ended, Murphy briefly scouted for the Red Sox, then entered the Boston front office when owner Tom Yawkey appointed him Director of Minor League Operations. Murphy spent 13 seasons running the Red Sox' farm and scouting systems until his dismissal following the season. In 1961, he joined former Yankees farm director and general manager George Weiss in the front office of Gotham's National League expansion team, the New York Mets.\n\nRising to the position of vice president, Murphy took over the general manager responsibilities following the 1967 season when Bing Devine returned to his longtime employers, the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nAs one of his first tasks, Murphy secured the services of manager Gil Hodges, under contract to the Washington Senators, by acquiring Hodges in a November 27, 1967, trade for pitcher Bill Denehy. Murphy's promotion to the GM role also coincided with the Mets' unveiling of some of the best young pitching talent of the era—including Tom Seaver, Nolan Ryan, Jerry Koosman, Tug McGraw, and others. With Hodges in command, the 1969 Miracle Mets stunned the baseball community by winning the NL East, sweeping Atlanta in the NLCS, then defeating a heavily favored Baltimore Orioles squad in five World Series games.\n\nHowever, not quite three months later, Murphy suffered a heart attack and died at age 61 early on January 14, 1970, in New York City. He was succeeded by Bob Scheffing.\n\nHis older brother Thomas was a federal prosecutor and judge.\n\n\n"}

He has also written poetry and drama.\n\nTessier was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, attended University College Dublin and lived in London in the United Kingdom for several years (where he was the managing director of Millington Books) before returning to the United States, where he lives still. His three published books of poetry are \"How We Died\" (New Writers Press, Dublin 1970), \"In Sight of Chaos\" (Turret Books, London 1971) and \"Abandoned Homes\" (Gallery Press, Dublin 1971). His plays have been produced, but not published.\n\nHis first book, \"The Fates\" (1978), is an episodic hybrid of horror and science fiction, about a mysterious force which causes death and destruction in an American town. One of the characters speculates that the Earth is revenging itself on humanity, but at the end of the book the mystery has not been solved and the destruction has not stopped.\n\nTessier's next book was \"The Nightwalker\" (1979), the brief, terse story of a young American Vietnam veteran adrift in London who seems possessed by an uncontrollable urge to inflict mutilation and death and may, in fact, be a werewolf. In \"Shockwaves\" (1982), a young woman achieves an ambition out of romantic fiction when an up-and-coming lawyer asks her to marry him; but her life is overshadowed by the presence of an apparently supernatural murderer known only as The Blade. \"Phantom\" (1982) deals with a young boy's confrontations with death, starting with his mother's dangerous asthma attack and ending with a disturbing vision of the afterlife.\n\nBesides works of supernatural horror, Tessier has also written non-supernatural stories such as \"Rapture\" (1987), about a psychopathic stalker, and \"Secret Strangers\" (1990), about a teenage girl whose father's sudden disappearance prompts her to an amoral rebellion which leads to the discovery of a suburban child abuse ring.\n\nTessier's other novels include \"Finishing Touches\" (1986), about a young doctor (again, an American alone in London) drawn into the sadistic world of a megalomaniac plastic surgeon; \"Fog Heart\" (1997), about the involvement of two married couples with a suicidal young medium; and \"Father Panic's Opera Macabre\" (2001), in which a writer of bland historical fiction is suddenly confronted with the atrocities which occurred in Croatia during the Second World War.\n\nA short novel, \"Wicked Things\", was published in 2007, accompanied by a novella, \"Scramburg, USA\".\n\nTessier's short fiction has been collected in \"Ghost Music and Other Tales\" (2000) and \"Remorseless: Tales of Cruelty\" (2013), and featured in \"Night Visions\".\n\nTessier is married to the former Alice Audietis.

He adapted and survived. But when the sounds of a nearby factory disturbed and awakened him, he emerged from underground and attacked the factory. He later appeared at Shirane and destroyed the village. Then he emerged at a farm, where he ate the livestock. During these attacks, he was not seen, so the mutant human Frankenstein was blamed. But a person who survived the destruction of the factory claimed a second monster had attacked it. When a small group of scientists searched for Frankenstein, an explosive woke Baragon from his sleep. He emerged to attack the scientists, but Frankenstein appeared to protect them. The two fought a climactic battle, with Frankenstein ultimately defeating Baragon by choking him and breaking his neck. In the end, a fissure appeared beneath the two and swallowed them into the Earth.\n\nIn \"Destroy All Monsters\", Baragon is seen as one of several monsters kept in captivity on Monster Island. Along with the rest of Earth's monsters, he is brought under the control of an alien race called the Kilaaks during their invasion of Earth and forced to destroy cities in their cause. He later breaks free from this mind control, and watches (but does not actually take part in) the fight against the Kilaaks and their remaining monster, King Ghidorah, before returning to Monster Island with the other Earth monsters.\n\nOf all the monsters in the Toho stable, the Baragon suit was borrowed and used the most by Tsuburaya Productions, the company made famous for its work on the TV show, \"Ultraman\". It was reused several times to create the monsters in the series: Neronga, Gabora, and Magular, as well as Pagos from \"Ultra Q\". Haruo Nakajima, the Godzilla suit actor as well as suit actor for Baragon in his initial debut, also played these monsters (with the exception of Magular).\n\nIn \"Destroy All Monsters\", Baragon was supposed to attack Paris for the film, but the Baragon suit was unavailable. Baragon was replaced with Gorosaurus for this scene, but was still blamed for the attack. Gorosaurus was also given Baragon's special burrowing ability and his signature roar to further confuse viewers. Baragon was also supposed to be used as a guard for the Kilaak base, but it was not shown on screen while doing this, possibly for the same reason above. Baragon's head was either lost or damaged, as a new head was constructed for the publicity photos of \"Destroy All Monsters\", with a more white-ish hue on the ears and sideways facing eyes. This head was recreated in XPlus's \"Destroy All Monsters\" line. Later, in 1971, the inner fiberglass skull of Baragon was used as a base for the flying form of Hedorah.\n\nIn the Millennium series, Baragon reappeared in the 2001 film, \"\" as one of three ancient guardian monsters. The other two are Mothra and King Ghidorah (originally Varan and Anguirus). When Godzilla is revived by the souls of the people who died in World War II, Baragon, Mothra, and King Ghidorah are summoned to protect the nation from the threat. Baragon was the first of the three guardians to confront Godzilla and was eventually killed by the monster's atomic breath. Baragon does not have a heat ray or a glowing horn, but still has extraordinary burrowing and jumping abilities.\n\nIn \"\", stock footage of Baragon from \"Frankenstein Conquers the World\" was seen during the opening claiming that Baragon was one of many monsters that arose due to the devastation that the World Wars brought, along with Varan, Gezora, Gaira, Titanosaurus, and Megaguirus.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It comprises the strip of land between the Floating Harbour to the north and the tidal New Cut of the River Avon to the south, from the dock entrance to the west to Bathurst Basin in the east. The island forms part of Cabot ward. The area between the Docks and New cut to the east of Bathurst Basin is in the neighbourhoods of Redcliffe and St Philip's Marsh.\n\nSpike Island was created by William Jessop in the early 19th century, when he constructed the New Cut and converted the former course of the River Avon into the Floating Harbour. Until the Second World War, a lock connected Bathurst Basin with the New Cut, and Spike Island was a genuine island surrounded on all sides by water. However, fears that an aerial attack on this lock at low tide could lead to a disastrous dewatering of the docks led to the lock being filled in.\n\nHistorically, Spike Island was the site of working quays, shipyards, warehousing and other associated dockside industry. The Bristol Harbour Railway runs the length of the island, and formerly connected these working areas with the railway network. With the redevelopment of the docks, the Island has become an area popular with developers looking to create prime dock side housing such as \"Baltic Wharf\", \"The Point\" and \"Perretts Court\". There are also a few restaurants and popular pubs such as \"The Orchard Inn\" and \"The Cottage\".\n\nOther formerly dock-related buildings have become cultural venues or museums. These include:\n\nOther historic buildings have been converted into office space, housing small businesses and legal and financial companies such as Creditcall.\n\nThe path of the harbour railway across Spike Island is proposed for a £38 million rapid transit bus route from Ashton Vale to the city centre.

Subject to planning permission and finances, work could start 2012 with services running 2014.\n"}

Originally the site of a monastic settlement, the island is dominated by an 18th-century star fort named Fort Mitchel. The island's strategic location within the harbour meant it was used at times for defence and as a prison. Since the early 21st century the island has been developed as a heritage tourist attraction, with €5.5 million investment in exhibition and visitor spaces and accompanying tourism marketing. There were in excess of 81,000 visitors to the island during 2019, a 21% increase on 2018 numbers. Spike Island was named top European tourist attraction at the 2017 World Travel Awards.\n\nThe principal evidence for a monastic foundation on Spike Island comes from Archdall's \"Moanasticon Hibernicum\", which states that Saint Mochuada founded a monastery there in the 7th century. While this may be correct, another passage from the \"Life of St Mochuada\" implies that Mochuada was associated with a place called \"Rahen\" (rather than Spike). A grant to Saint Thomas's Abbey in Dublin in 1178 of the Church of Saint Rusien on Spike Island may lend credence to a monastic settlement - as the name and date both indicate a Celtic foundation. The ruins of a church are reported to exist on Spike Island in 1774.\n\nThe grant to St Thomas's abbey in 1178 coincides with the surrender of lands, including Spike Island, by Diarmid McCarthy King of Desmond to the Normans. In 1182 one Raymond Mangunel was granted or \"enfeoffed\" Spike Island. There are no further recorded changes in ownership until 1427. In this year, records suggest that William, son of John Reych, granted to John Pyke, \"amongst other lands and premises, the lands of Innyspyge, in the Comte Cork\". In 1490 Thomas Pyke granted to Maurice Ronan of Kinsale, his holdings in Spike Island. In the seventeenth century, the island was in the possession of the Roche and Galwey families - until the rebellion of 1641 when these families forfeited possession of the island. Although this forfeiture was reversed on the accession of King Charles II of England in 1660, they did not regain possession. In 1698 the island was in the possession of Arnold Joost van Keppel 1st Earl of Albermarle who had accompanied William of Orange to England in 1688. In 1698 he conveyed the island to William Smith of Ballymore on the Great Island. In the 1770s, the island was in the hands of Nicholas Fitton. It would seem that the government leased part of the island for fortifications in the 1770s while the owner remained in residence - the house only being demolished during the construction of the present fort. Eventually, the entire island was rented and there are a number of references in Parliamentary Papers to the payment of rent for the island extending into the 1870s.\n\nIt was possibly used by smugglers for a time, and a map of circa 1600 clearly shows some form of fortified tower on the island similar to a depiction of Belvelly Castle on the Great Island also shown. The island's location at the entrance to Cork Harbour meant that the island held strategic importance - and it was a significant site in the French intervention following the Glorious Revolution (1689).\n\nThe first artillery fortification on the island was built in 1779. Its construction was prompted by the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775 and in particular by the entry of France (1778) and Spain (1779) into the war on the American side. Cork Harbour was used as an assembly point for convoys to the Americas and at one point more than 400 vessels were assembled in the harbour. Additionally, Cork was an important source of supplies for the British forces operating in the West Indies and North America. There was, therefore, a need to protect the harbour from potential attackers. The Spike Island Battery was a temporary work and armed with eighteen 24 pounder cannon moved from Cobh Fort. After the Treaty of Paris ended the war in 1783, this temporary work was demolished.\n\nIn 1789 Colonel Charles Vallancey of the Corps of Irish Engineers, who had been made responsible for the fortification of the harbour during the American war, persuaded the then Lord Lieutenant John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland to allow the construction of a permanent fortification on Spike Island. This work was undertaken by the Irish Board of Ordnance. In October 1790 the Earl visited the island and named the incomplete structure Fort Westmorland. In 1793 France declared war on Britain and a conflict began which, with one interlude, would occupy the next two decades. In 1794, on the departure of Westmorland, his successor as Lord Lieutenant, (likely William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam) halted construction of Fort Westmorland. Eventually, Vallancey was allowed to continue but the fort was still incomplete in 1797. It was however completed by 1802 as a plan of that date shows. By 1800, this fort was armed with 29 24-pounder guns, two 12-pounder guns and twelve 6-pounder cannon. Also included were two 6-pounder field guns and two 5.5 inches howitzers. It also had three 13-inch, two 10-inch, two 8-inch and six 5.5-inch mortars.\n\nThe defenses of Cork Harbour faced two threats. Firstly an attack by war-ships forcing entry into the harbour - either in a raid to destroy shipping or to effect a landing of troops. Secondly they faced the threat of attack from the land by forces which had been landed at an undefended point along the coast. Just such a landing had been attempted by the French at Bantry Bay in 1796 with a force of fifteen thousand men. While unsuccessful, the attempt greatly alarmed the military. Vallancey was of the belief that had the French actually landed, they would have taken the Cork Harbour forts, including Fort Westmorland.\n\nIn 1802, General John Hope, 4th Earl of Hopetoun, recommended that a major fortress is constructed on Spike Island, capable of holding 2,000-3,000 men. He considered Spike Island was for Cork Harbour 'the true point of defence' Lieutenant General David Dundas was consulted by the Duke of York, Commander in Chief, who also recommended that a fortress should be erected on Spike Island. Wiliam Twiss of the Royal Engineers concurred.\n\nIn 1801 The Acts of Union came into force and responsibility for fortifications in Ireland passed from the Irish Board of Ordnance, which was abolished, to the Board of Ordnance in London. It was the job of the Board to implement the decision to erect the fortress and it fell to Charles Holloway Commanding Engineer Cork District to begin the works. In 1804 The Hampshire Chronicle reported that the overall height of Spike island had been reduced by 25 feet and the spoil used as infill to create a level foundation. The same paper reported that on 6 June 1804 General Sir Eyre Coote had laid the foundation stone of the new fortress. \n\nTwo alternative proposals had been made for accommodation within the fort. One envisaged six barrack blocks, one of which was actually constructed in the fort, this being the officers mess block, The ground floor of these blocks consisted of a series of bombproof brick vaulted rooms. The first floor was slate-roofed and open to destruction in the event of a bombardment. The second proposal was for 6 sets of bombproof casemates set into the ramparts. Two such sets of casemates were actually constructed, these being the north-east and north-west casemates. The second accommodation block to be constructed, the A Block, shows a divergence from the original plan in that the bombproofing is incorporated into the roof. The ground floor of a third block, the B Block, was intended to follow the design of the A block, was erected before the first phase of construction ended (circa 1817). The four magazines were also constructed around this time. A large workforce was employed in the construction, and included both troops and civilian workmen.\n\nLater a prison and convict depot, the island was used to house convicts prior to penal transportation. Opened in 1847 to deal with growing number of convictions for theft during the Great Famine, the prison grew into what \"for a few years in the mid-19th century [..] was probably [..] the biggest prison in the British Empire\". It gained a reputation as \"Ireland's Alcatraz\".\n\nSpike Island was home to Ellen (Nellie) Organ who gained special permission to take First Communion shortly before her death at the age of 4. On hearing her story, the pope lowered the age at which communion could be taken, from 12 to 7.\n\nThe island remained in use as a garrison and prison through the Irish War of Independence, when IRA prisoners were held there. Richard Barrett was among those detained there, but escaped during the truce of 1921.. Over 1400 men were held on the island at its peak until the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.\nOn 6 December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was concluded. It provided for the establishment of the Irish Free State which happened on 6 December 1922. The Treaty included provisions by which the British would retain sovereignty over three strategically important ports known as the Treaty ports, one of which is described in the Treaty as:\n\nAccordingly, even after the establishment of the Irish Free State, the Royal Navy continued to maintain its presence at Spike Island. Spike Island remained under British sovereignty until 11 July 1938 when pursuant to the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement of 25 April 1938, the territory was ceded to Ireland. The handover ceremonies were attended by senior military and political figures, including Éamon de Valera and Frank Aiken.\n\nFollowing its handover to Ireland, the island's installations were renamed Fort Mitchel - after John Mitchel, nationalist activist and political journalist who was held on the island for a time. (Similar Treaty Port fortifications at \"Fort Camden\" and \"Fort Carlisle\" were similarly renamed to \"Fort Meagher\" and \"Fort Davis\" respectively.)\nThe island remained the site of a prison and military base (for the regular Irish Army, the FCÁ and later the Navy) for some time. Late into the 20th century, it was used as a youth correctional facility. On 1 September 1985 inmates rioted and, as a subsequent Dáil committee reported, \"civilians, prison officers and the Gardai on the Island were virtual prisoners of the criminals\". During the riot, one of the accommodation blocks, Block A, caught fire and is known as the Burnt Block. This prison facility closed in 2004.\n\nThe island also had a small civilian population; a small school, church and ferry (launch) service to Cobh served the population. The island is known locally for having excellent earth for growing crops. The civilian population has since left the island, however, with many previous residents moving to nearby Cobh.\n\nIn May 2006 the then Minister for Justice Michael McDowell announced plans to build a new prison on the island. However, in January 2007, it was decided to explore an alternative site for the new prison, and a local task group was set up to re-open Spike as a historical tourist site. In 2009 it was announced that ownership of the island would be transferred (free of charge) to Cork County Council to enable its development as a tourist attraction. The Council formed a steering group to explore how Spike Island might be developed as a tourist site, and the Council subsequently licensed operators to give guided tours of the island.\n\nSince 2015, tours depart from Cobh during the summer, taking in the fort, prison cells, gun emplacements, and key points of interest.\n\nFollowing additional €5.5m investment by Cork County Council and Fáilte Ireland, additional attractions and facilities were opened for the Summer 2016 season. As well as the previously opened buildings and 6-inch gun emplacements, as of Summer 2016, visitors to the \"Fortress Spike Island\" cultural heritage attraction can also tour the \"punishment block\", the 1980s cells (which include an exhibition on the 1985 Spike Island riot), the recreation of the hull of a \"transportation ship\", and an interpretative installation on John Mitchel - for whom the fort is named.\n\nIn September 2017, at the World Travel Awards, Spike Island was named 'Europe's Leading Tourist Attraction', ahead of the Acropolis in Athens, Buckingham Palace in London, and the Eiffel Tower in Paris.\n\n"}

Working at Wizards of the Coast, Pramas had inside information on the d20 license, and Green Ronin's lead d20 offering, \"Death in Freeport\" (2000) went on sale on August 10, 2000, the same day as the new third edition \"Player's Handbook\" (2000) for \"D&D\". In 2001, Green Ronin expanded beyond their early Freeport adventures and went into the business of publishing sourcebooks and other gaming material. In March 2002, Pramas was laid off from Wizards of the Coast and took this as an opportunity to go full-time with Green Ronin, doubling the company's production that year. Green Ronin's first new RPG was \"Spaceship Zero\" (2002); Toren Atkinson of the rock band The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets had contributed artwork to \"Ork!\" and \"Death in Freeport\" and asked Pramas to publish a game based on the band's album \"Spaceship Zero Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\" (2000). Green Ronin's other RPG of the year was \"Mutants & Masterminds\" (2002), created by Steve Kenson who Pramas had asked to design a new d20-based superhero RPG based on his freelance work on a number of superhero RPGs. In 2003, former Pinnacle Entertainment Group graphic designer, art director and Deadlands RPG brand manager Hal Mangold joined as partner, and the company formally established itself as an LLC. Mangold was Green Ronin's primary graphic designer and art director on a freelance basis since soon after the company's founding, doing the layout and design for the majority of the company's print output. (Ork!, laid out by Nicole Lindroos, and the Mutants & Masterminds game line, handled by the Super Unicorn design studio, were notable exceptions.)\n\nOn May 12, 2010, Green Ronin Publishing announced a third edition of the superhero role-playing game \"Mutants & Masterminds\" would debut in the fall. This announcement came just 9 days after the publisher announced that it would debut a new \"DC Adventures\" game in August, based upon \"Mutants & Masterminds\". According to Green Ronin President Chris Pramas, the two new games will \"share a common ruleset.\"\n\nIn 2013, Green Ronin Publishing used crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to redesign and enlarge the Freeport campaign setting for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.\n\nGreen Ronin wrote the second edition of \"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay\", which was published by Black Industries. Other notable products include Freeport: The City of Adventure, \"Green Ronin’s signature city setting\" and \"home to thousands of RPG campaigns since its launch in 2000\", \"Thieves' World\", and \"The Black Company\" d20 settings, \"Mutants & Masterminds\", \"Blue Rose\", and \"True20\". Licensed products include the \"A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying\" game, the \"Dragon Age\" roleplaying game, and \"DC Adventures\", a licensed roleplaying game based on the characters and setting found in \"DC Comics\".\n\nThe \"Spirosblaak\" (2005) setting from Green Ronin's \"Mythic Vistas\" series was supported by Misfit Studios.\n"}

The first phase concentrates on the eastern region of river landing and includes redeveloping the waterfront, a hotel complex and a destination complex. The second phase concentrates on the western region including the cleanup of the old A. L Cole site (a decommissioned electrical power plant that had been torn down in the 1990s), park land and the conversion of a pre-existing electrical service building into a year-round home for the farmer’s market, business centre and residential development. \nPlans for redevelopment of the riverbank have come and gone since the 1970s. One of the first steps towards redeveloping the area was the demolishing of the old Saskatoon Arena in the early 1980s; at one point there were plans to build a new hockey rink and convention centre on the site, but ultimately it was decided to build Saskatchewan Place (now Credit Union Centre) on the city's outskirts. In 1989, the Arena site became an outdoor entertainment venue in conjunction with that year's Canada Summer Games, and proved popular enough that there was talk of the site becoming a permanent outdoor venue. Around this time, the city unveiled plans for a market and hotel on the site as part of its South Downtown Redevelopment scheme which also involved redeveloping several adjacent blocks to the north.\n\nIn the early 1990s, despite much criticism, the city council of the day abandoned the market/hotel plan and instead allowed the construction of a senior citizen's residence tower on the former arena site. There was also increased concern regarding rising crime in the neighboring Riversdale community. Despite this, plans for redeveloping the remaining riverbank lands as a cultural, commercial, and entertainment area continued. In the 1990s the A.L. Cole power plant was demolished after sitting unused for nearly a decade, followed in the mid-2000s by the demolition of the Gathercole Building (once Riverview Collegiate), which had formerly housed the Saskatoon Board of Education offices, and was last used as a hospital set in the filming of a short-lived television show.\n\nThe last major hurdle towards redevelopment of the site was cleared in 2005 when an agreement was reached with the Royal Canadian Legion over the sale of their building, however later that year the project encountered a stumbling block when the city announced the sudden closure of the century-old Traffic Bridge due to safety concerns; the bridge was expected to be a major access route into River Landing. After considering the possibility of replacing the bridge—an option criticized by the developers of River Landing—the city instead chose to repair the bridge and it reopened to vehicular traffic in September 2006. As part of the River Landing project, a roundabout was constructed at the foot of the bridge at the intersection of 3rd Avenue S. and Spadina Crescent, replacing the traffic lights used previously; this was the first roundabout constructed in Saskatoon since the unpopular \"Traffic Circle\" at 8th Street and Circle Drive was dismantled more than a decade earlier, although the new roundabout is a fraction of the size of the Traffic Circle.\n\nPhase one consists of:\n\nPhase two consists of:\n"}

It was established in January 1988 under the \"Labour Services Act, 1987\" and was run by a board appointed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, composed of employer and trade union representatives.\n\nThe authority, whose Irish language name literally translates as \"the Labour Facilities Foundation\", was the successor to An Chomhairle Oiliúna (\"the training council\", commonly referred to as AnCO), the National Manpower Service and the Youth Employment Agency. The Irish word \"fás\" formed by the acronym means \"growth\", and the authority was created in 1980s Ireland during the long economic downturn of the time.\n\nThe authority ran a number of \"JobCentres\" in Ireland to facilitate those seeking employment, however it had occasionally been criticised, not least for the perception that it is simply a scheme to remove people from unemployment statistics – it had also been criticised for the expense of running it at almost €1 billion per annum. The authority ran training courses in various fields, through regional centres, although some of this work was transferred to institutes of technology – including the apprenticeships in various fields that it regulated.\n\nApprenticeships regulated by FÁS include:\nBy tradition, the Director General of FÁS is a board member of Forfás. Brian Geoghegan (spouse of Mary Harney, Minister for Health and Children) retired as Chairman of FÁS at the end of 2005 and was replaced by Peter McLoone. There had been some controversy regarding Geoghegan's position when it emerged he was also a board member of IBEC, the employer's union of Ireland. IBEC have been critical of FÁS at times claiming, at various intervals, that some FÁS courses and schemes are a waste of money, taking potential employees off the live register who could otherwise be employed in mainstream positions. The fact that Geoghegan is married to Minister Mary Harney, who was formerly the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, led to some claims he had a conflict of interest.\n\nIn September 2008, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Mary Coughlan announced that the Comptroller and Auditor General would undertake an investigation of FÁS expenditure in light of what she saw as the evident public disquiet on the issue. The annual budget for FÁS at the time was around €1 billion. In November 2008, The Dáil Public Accounts Committee (PAC) also began an investigation. However, it was information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by journalist and Senator Shane Ross which he published in the \"Sunday Independent\" that brought the FÁS expenses scandal to a head.\n\nThe documents obtained by Senator Ross showed that some €643,000 had been spent over the course of four years on transatlantic travel promoting the agency's Science Challenge Programme. The expenses included items such as first class air fares, business class air fares and fares paid for by FÁS for spouses, rounds of golf as well as nail and beauty treatment. It also revealed that three Government ministers and two junior ministers had attended in that time for inconsequential reasons .\n\nThis revelation caused major controversy and pressure was brought to bear on FÁS Director General Roddy Molloy to resign, although Taoiseach Brian Cowen spoke in support of Molloy both publicly and in the Dáil. Molloy went so far as to appear on the Pat Kenny Show on RTÉ Radio 1 to defend the expenses incurred.\n\nHowever, under ever increasing pressure, Molloy resigned as Director General on 25 November 2008.\n\nIn September 2009 the board announced it would resign and the Irish Times announced that legislation to restructure the organisation was expected in the following four weeks.\n\nThe report into the breakdown of internal controls in FÁS by the Comptroller and Auditor General was published in 2010.\n\nIn July 2011 the Minister for Education and Skills announced that FÁS would be replaced by a new agency, named SOLAS, that would have responsibility for all public funding of further education and training. The training function of FÁS was absorbed into the restructured local Vocational Education Committees which were retitled Education and Training Boards in July 2013.\n\n"}
{"id": "2207513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207513", "title": "Book of Love (band)", "text": "Book of Love (band)\n\nBook of Love is an American synthpop and electronic band, formed in 1983 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and later based in New York City. Led by vocalist Susan Ottaviano, the band also includes keyboardists Ted Ottaviano (no relation to Susan), Lauren Roselli and Jade Lee. The band gained its first exposure as the opening act for two Depeche Mode tours in 1985 and 1986. The group has been described by the \"Houston Press\" as \"forward thinking\" for lyrics dealing with sexual orientation and gender roles.\n\nTheir biggest success came on the US dance charts, placing seven singles in the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart between 1985 and 1993. The group's largest exposure on pop radio was with the song \"Pretty Boys and Pretty Girls\", one of the first songs to openly address the AIDS epidemic. The song, from the album \"Lullaby\", was originally the second half of a medley with the group's version of Mike Oldfield's \"Tubular Bells,\" the 1973 instrumental that served as the eerie theme music of the classic horror film \"The Exorcist\". Edited down to single length, \"Pretty Boys and Pretty Girls\" became Book of Love's only Hot 100 entry, peaking at no. 90 in 1988.\n\nBook of Love's music has been featured in various films and television over the years. The band's song \"Modigliani (Lost in Your Eyes)\" was featured in the 1987 John Hughes film \"Planes, Trains & Automobiles\" as well as in the \"Miami Vice\" episode, \"God's Work\". In 1991, the song \"Sunny Day\" was featured in the movie \"The Silence of the Lambs\", in a scene in which band member Lauren Roselli had a cameo with Jodie Foster. Also, the song \"Enchanted,\" from the band's \"Lovebubble\" album, appeared on the soundtrack to the 1993 film \"Naked in New York\", and the song \"I Touch Roses,\" was featured in the 2000 movie \"American Psycho.\"\n\nSince their active years, Book of Love's songs \"Boy\" and \"I Touch Roses\" have been rediscovered by new audiences. Both their original versions and subsequent remixes are heard in both dance clubs and on alternative radio stations.\n\nIn February, 2001 — sixteen years after its first dance chart entry — Book of Love had its first #1 hit on the US dance chart when \"Boy,\" a track originally from its debut album, was remixed and re-released as the lead single from their greatest hits collection, \"\".\n\nIn 2013, the band reunited for a string of club tour dates and has been working on new material.\n\nTed Ottaviano became friends and started writing songs with Susan Ottaviano while attending high school together in Connecticut. Despite sharing the same last name, they are not related, though their family ancestries trace back to the same small southern Italian village. After high school, Susan Ottaviano moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to attend the Philadelphia College of Art. While at art college, Susan met Jade Lee and they formed a band named Head Cheese with friend Celeste Ries. In July 1981, Head Cheese recorded their first songs at the recording studio Third Story with producer David Javelosa. A 7\" record was released on Burn Potential Records including three songs, A-sides: \"Teenage Idol\" and \"Non-Melodic\", and B-side \"Jungle Jam\", which has been described as \"an offbeat love song to the city of Philly.\" Ted Ottaviano, a commuting member of Head Cheese, was one of the executive producers, co-wrote \"Non-Melodic\" with Susan, and also did photography for the record sleeve. While Susan Ottaviano was in Philadelphia at art college, Ted Ottaviano was attending the School of Visual Arts in New York City, where he met Lauren Roselli. For a time, the band was a long distance creative project between Philadelphia and New York City. Book of Love was officially formed in May 1983.\n\nThe band name Book of Love is taken from the song \"The Book of Love\" by The Monotones. Ted Ottaviano has stated, \"It's not that we had a love for that song at all, it's just the imagery worked for us. Especially at that time, when we started Book of Love early to mid-'80s, there was kind of a throwback to a lot of romanticism and we were really into that. We nicked the band name from that song, that's for sure.\"\n\nIn 1983, Susan Ottaviano produced a local compilation album called \"I'd Rather Be in Philadelphia\", which was issued on Burn Potential Records and featured several bands from the Philadelphia area, including Pretty Poison. Book of Love's contribution to the compilation was the song \"Henna\", becoming their first song released. Jade Lee designed the album's bright orange cover that included an overlay graphic of a Philadelphia street map.\n\nIn 1984, after having completed art college, Susan Ottaviano and Jade Lee moved to New York City to unite with Ted Ottaviano and Lauren Roselli. The band members spent their evenings at Danceteria, CBGB, Pyramid Club, Mudd Club, and Hurrah. Lauren Roselli explained, \"New York City was a big playground, full of misfits like ourselves. There were lots of great clubs to go dancing and hear great music and meet other artists. That was our MySpace.\" Throughout art school until their time in New York City, the band had been heavily influenced by the late punk scene and new wave of the early 1980s. The band has cited various influences over the years, including girl groups of the 1950s and 1960s, bubblegum, glitter, David Bowie, The Ramones, Patti Smith, early Human League, Gary Numan, Altered Images, The Psychedelic Furs, Kate Bush, Cocteau Twins, P.i.L., The Cure, early Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark, and Depeche Mode.\n\nDuring 1984 and 1985, the band recorded various demos at the recording studio Noise in midtown Manhattan. One of the demos was the song \"Boy\", a toe-tapping tale of teen-girl angst featuring tubular bells and a skip-along beat.\nNoise recording studio had many bells and chimes available at the band's disposal. Reflecting on that time, Ted Ottaviano stated, \"I was fascinated with Altered Images and other bands that were incorporating bells and chimes into their music. Long brass chimes, tubular bells, whatever. It sounded right, for the time.\"\n\nKeyboardist Lauren Roselli gave a copy of the \"Boy\" demo to disc jockey Ivan Ivan, who had recently co-produced the dancefloor hit \"The Dominatrix Sleeps Tonight\" by Dominatrix. Ivan forwarded the demo to Sire Records president Seymour Stein, who subsequently signed the group to his label in August 1984.\n\nIn 1985, the band began recording what would become their debut album at Unique Recording with Ivan Ivan as producer. The band recorded two tracks for the single \"Boy\" and the band's theme song \"Book of Love\". \"Boy\" was released as a single, and became a huge dance club hit, peaking at no. 7 on the Billboard]] Hot Dance Club Play chart. A rare Australian promotional video was shot for the song, featuring the band performing the song with Ted Ottaviano playing tubular bells.\n\nAfter having a hit with \"Boy\", the band quit their day jobs. While doing promotion for the single, the band met Depeche Mode at a party hosted by Rockpool (modern rock promotion company). Subsequently, the band was offered the opening slot on the North American leg of Depeche Mode's Some Great Reward Tour. Starting in Washington D.C. on March 14, 1985, the band, still without an album, joined the tour with Depeche Mode, playing coast to coast throughout their 15 North American tour dates.\n\nUpon returning from the Depeche Mode tour, the band went straight into the recording studio to record \"Happy Day\" for inclusion on the UK single of \"Boy\". The remainder of the summer was spent on a small club tour of the southern states that the Depeche Mode tour had skipped over, and recording the songs \"I Touch Roses\" and \"Lost Souls\" for the next single. \"I Touch Roses\" was then released in September 1985. Daniel Miller, founder of Mute Records and producer of Depeche Mode, remixed the song as a single remix and an extended 'Full Bloom Version' for the European single that was released in early 1986. \"I Touch Roses\" became a big club hit, peaking at no. 8 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. Because of the success of \"I Touch Roses\", the band got a green light to finish the album. \"We were the little choo-choo train. We didn't know it at the time, but thankfully with \"I Touch Roses\", it was not preordained that Sire was developing us at the time. There was no grand scheme. It was more a la carte. But then people started picking up on 'Roses' and then the album happened,\" recalled Ted Ottaviano in 2009.\n\nUp until the end of the summer of 1985, the band had only recorded five songs (\"Boy\", \"Book of Love\", \"Happy Day\", \"I Touch Roses\", and \"Lost Souls\"). Following the success of \"I Touch Roses\", the band resumed work on the album in September 1985 at Unique Recording and Sigma Sound Studios in New York City, recording the seven new songs that would make up the rest of their debut album. Instruments the band used to record the album were various synthesizers (Oberheim Xpander, Yamaha DX-7, Casio CZ-1000, Roland Juno 6, Roland JX-8P), an E-mu Emulator sampler, piano, tubular bells, chimes, melodica, and both acoustic and electronic percussion (Yamaha RX-11 drum machine, Simmons Toms). The main songwriting duties on \"Book of Love\" fell to Ted Ottaviano, with Susan Ottaviano co-writing six of the tracks, and Jade Lee contributing to two. One of the songs recorded was a cover song of \"Die Matrosen\" (\"The Sailor\", in English), originally by the all-girl Swiss post-punk band LiLiPUT, which features a catchy chorus of whistling. Recording of the album was finally finished in January 1986.\n\nThe eponymous debut album \"Book of Love\" was finally released on April 1, 1986, during the peak of synthpop in the 1980s. \"You Make Me Feel So Good\" was released as the first official single from the record on July 31, 1986, and became Book of Love's first CHR radio hit. The song was remixed for the single by Jellybean and Ivan Ivan. Album track \"Lost Souls\", was also remixed and extended by Mark Kamins and included on the 12-inch single. In April 1986, a music video was filmed on location in New York City for \"You Make Me Feel So Good\" and released in late July along with the single to promote the album.\n\nIn 1986, Depeche Mode once again asked the band to be their opening act. Finally with an album to promote, Book of Love toured as the opening act on the massive Depeche Mode Black Celebration Tour, joining the band's first European leg on April 29, 1986 in Hanover, West Germany, and playing 48 shows in twelve weeks throughout the full North American leg which ended on July 15, 1986 in Irvine, California. Once the Depeche Mode tour was through, the band set out on their own headlining tour of clubs, beginning in Boston on August 8, 1986 and ending in Albion, Michigan in March 1987.\n\nA second official and final single taken from the album, \"Modigliani (Lost in Your Eyes)\", was released in April, 1987. The song was a dance club hit, peaking at no. 17 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart, becoming as popular as New Order and Depeche Mode singles in clubs at its peak. \"Modigliani (Lost in Your Eyes)\" is an ode to Italian painter Amedeo Modigliani. The track was penned by Jade Lee, Susan and Ted Ottaviano, who had been inspired by the Italian painter's works and history.\n\nThe cover of the single featured one of Modigliani's famous paintings of his mistress Jeanne Hebuterne, along with the short biography of the painter written by Ted Ottaviano. For the back sleeve of the 12-inch single, Susan Ottaviano made drawings of each member of the band in the style of Modigliani. Similar, yet alternate large portrait drawings of the band were later used as large stage props behind the band on their Lullaby Tour in 1989.\n\nThe four-minute 'Requiem Mass' remixed version of \"Modigliani (Lost in Your Eyes)\" was featured in an episode of \"Miami Vice\" on November 6, 1987, and both the original single and 'Requiem Mass' remix were used in the 1987 film \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\".\n\nIn 1987, Philadelphia-based satirical punk rock band The Dead Milkmen released a single ironically titled \"Instant Club Hit (You'll Dance to Anything)\", which hurled insults about the fans of then current popular club artists, calling them \"pathetic\", \"art fags\", \"boring bisexuals\", and \"Danceteria types\". Book of Love was specifically named with other bands The Smiths, Depeche Mode, and Public Image Ltd. with the line, \"you'll dance to anything by Book of Love\". The end of the song effectively lumped the bands together as \"a bunch of stupid Europeans who come over here with their big hairdos intent on taking our money instead of giving your cash, where it belongs, to a decent American artist like myself.\"\n\nIn November 1988, the album \"Book of Love\" was made available on CD for the first time. The new CD edition included five bonus remixes.\n\nPromotional duties and non-stop touring in support of Depeche Mode's Black Celebration tour had kept Book of Love from entering the studio to lay down ideas for their second record. In a 2009 interview, Ted Ottaviano stated, \"It's the classic story. We weren't quite sure where the first album would take us, and it ended up taking us on a ride. But then we had to turn right around and write and record songs for the follow-up. I'm not sure we had enough distance, enough time, to fully grasp what this meant or entailed.\" In the spring of 1987, the band was finally able to lay down some demos for the next record, writing the new songs between March through August.\n\nIn late September 1987, the band eventually convened at D+D Recording and Unique Recording Studios in New York to record with esteemed producer Mark Ellis, aka Flood (Depeche Mode, Erasure, Nitzer Ebb, Nine Inch Nails), who had just produced Erasure's \"The Circus\" the previous year, along with engineering on U2's \"The Joshua Tree\". Flood co-produced the record with Ted Ottaviano. Reflecting on the recording in 2009, Susan Ottaviano stated, \"It was great to be part of some of Ted's Cecil B. DeMille-styled productions. We had a full orchestra and a bagpipe player wearing a kilt for the song \"Lullaby\". We also recorded the organ at Cathedral of St. John the Divine (NYC) for \"With a Little Love\". It was such an amazing experience.\" The cathedral organ drenched, \"With A Little Love\", marked the first Book Of Love song to feature Ted Ottaviano on lead vocals. On recording with Flood, Ted Ottaviano stated, \"We spent one night there, from about 10 pm to 6 am. Flood miked the entire cathedral. He was totally game for what we wanted to do.\" \nIn December 1987, the band recorded their cover version of the song \"We Three Kings\", adding their own twist to the Christmas carol. The song was featured alongside tracks by Erasure, The Pretenders, Prince, and The Ramones, on the Warner Bros. Records promotional holiday album compilation \"Yulesville\", released in late 1987. Recording in New York ended on December 18, 1987, with the band reuniting with Flood on January 1, 1988 to record vocals at the Great Hall at Hansa Tonstudios Berlin. Flood mixed \"Melt My Heart\" and \"Champagne Wishes\" and the recording of the album was finished. The remaining eight tracks were mixed by Alan Meyerson in L.A. in February, and the album mastered in March at Sterling Sound.\n\nPreceding the album, the first single, \"Pretty Boys and Pretty Girls\" was released on May 24, 1988. \"Pretty Boys and Pretty Girls\" became one of the first songs to address the issue of the AIDS epidemic with its lyric of \"Strangers in the night exchanging glances, but sex is dangerous, I don't take my chances ... safe sex, safe sex.\" The song became the band's highest charting single at no. 90 in the Billboard Hot 100, and the only moment crossing over into mainstream pop. In the dance clubs, the song was a smash, and made it to no. 5 on the Hot Dance Club Play Chart, spending 11 weeks on the chart. A music video for \"Pretty Boys And Pretty Girls\" was shot by director Carlos Grosso and released to promote the new album.\n\nBook of Love's second album \"Lullaby\" was released on June 21, 1988, and spent ten weeks on the \"Billboard\" 200, peaking at no. 156, the highest album placement of their career. The album sleeve is a photograph from 1872 of a girl posing as cupid, titled \"Cupid Considering\", by Julia Margaret Cameron, from the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House. Opening the album is a cover of Mike Oldfield's \"Tubular Bells\", originally made famous as the theme from the horror movie \"The Exorcist\". For the track, the band sampled Lauren Roselli channeling Linda Blair's role as Regan, crying \"Mother, make it stop!\" It flows seamlessly into the second track on the album, the first single \"Pretty Boys and Pretty Girls\". The two tracks were also remixed into a 14:25 minute extended medley version on the single.\n\nThe second single was the album's title track \"Lullaby\", featuring a galloping bassline, bagpipe drones and solo, lullaby vocal harmonies, and lush strings by a string section of 20 Juilliard students. The song peaked at no. 27 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Chart and spent seven weeks on the chart. The song has become one of Book of Love's signature songs, achieving classic status among their catalogue.\n\nThe band had intended to tour in the fall of 1988, but the illness of a band member delayed the tour until 1989. In late December 1988, the band played several warm up shows including N.Y.C., five dates in Texas, and Norman, Oklahoma on January 2, 1989.\nTo promote \"Lullaby\", the band headlined their own Lullaby Tour of clubs in the spring of 1989 with various local acts opening in each city. The band's U.S. tour lasted for four months, with dates spanning February 23 through June 29, 1989. The band took two weeks out of their tour schedule in mid-April to remix the track \"Witchcraft\", and another week in May to edit the song for the next single.\n\nThe third and final single taken from the album was \"Witchcraft\" and released July 15, 1989. It was the only single from the album that failed to make the Billboard charts. The track samples the classic 1960s TV series \"Bewitched\", and also contains a chant of names of the witches/characters from the show ... \"Enchantra, Endora, Tabitha, Esmerelda, Clara, Hagatha\". The song features quirky deadpan rap-style vocals from Susan Ottaviano, Jade Lee, and Lauren Roselli, incanting the ingredients for a love potion. When performing the song on the Lullaby Tour, the band donned witches' hats, making it a fan favorite of the band's live shows.\n\nBook of Love released their third record two years following their moderately successful album, \"Lullaby\". After having substantial success on college radio stations and the dancefloor in the 1980s, \"Candy Carol\" was released amid the changing musical landscape of the early 1990s. In a 2009 interview, Lauren Roselli Johnson stated, \"I think we had great momentum going from \"Book of Love\" to \"Lullaby\". Then, after the 1980s were gone and the 1990s arrived with a very heavy shift in [music] genres, production became valued-or not. There was hip hop, grunge, and house music. I think we fit in less and less with that stuff. It was kind of the beginning of the end of our story.\"\n\nThe songs for \"Candy Carol\" were written and recorded in 1989 and 1990, and were \"musically based on the late-60s pop idiom\". The band's intent was to record a modern album recreating the style of late-1960s pop. Explaining the meaning of \"Candy Carol\", Ted Ottaviano stated, \"To me, Candy Carol represents melody. The purity of melody is something that can give you a good feeling the way a Christmas carol can. I don't think there is anything religious about the songs on the album. But, they are inspired by the idea and feeling of a carol. I am inspired by carols the same way I would be inspired by a Renaissance or Byzantine painting.\"\n\nThe band spent time recording the album at three different studios in New York City with Ted Ottaviano co-producing the record with Ben Grosse. Lauren Roselli, for the first time, contributed creatively as a songwriter, and co-wrote two songs, \"Flower Parade\" and \"Counting the Rosaries\". For the two tracks, she also took on lead vocal duties for the first time. In a 2009 interview, Lauren Roselli Johnson stated, \"Ted really nurtured me and shared his process with me openly. In return, I always respected and tried to help him to hear out his vision. I think at that point, I was ready and wanted to write. Ted encouraged it and facilitated it.\" For recording of the album track \"Turn The World\", Book of Love invited thirty of their friends to the recording studio to be the singing choir in the chorus of the song. Another album track titled \"Wall Song\", a semi-instrumental piece, was inspired by the breakdown of the Berlin Wall, and features spoken word sections of Jade Lee reading a German version of the poem \"Autumn\" by Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke.\n\nRecording sessions with co-producer Ben Grosse began January 15, 1990, at Chung King House of Metal, where the band laid down basic tracks for a month and a half. After the taking a break in early March to pursue individual projects, they reconvened on April 16, 1990 at The Hit Factory to record vocals until mid-May. From there, the band moved to Unique Recording Studios to record overdubs, and finishing the recording of the album on June 8, 1990. In July, the album was mixed at Pearl Sound, Detroit, MI. by Ted Ottaviano and Ben Grosse, and then finally mastered at Sterling Sound.\n\n\"Candy Carol\" was originally scheduled to be released on October 15, 1990. The band had hoped to have the album out well before Christmas, so as not to compete with holiday releases. The remixing of \"Alice Everyday\" took producer Ben Grosse a couple extra weeks, causing the label to push the release back. The band decided to delay the release until the new year so that it would receive full support from the label. On the subject, Ted Ottaviano stated, \"At first it really upset us because we were anticipating the release of it for almost two and a half years. But as January approached, it was obvious that it was the best thing to do because you don't get the attention you deserve when you're a smaller band.\"\n\nThe first single taken from the record was \"Alice Everyday\", released before the album in January 1991, and features sing-song vocals and a refrain consisting of a laundry list of girls' names. The title of the song \"Alice Everyday\" is an actual real name of a woman from the 1800s that Ted Ottaviano came across while collecting girls names in a notebook. In the dance clubs, the song was a moderate hit, and made it to no. 21 on the Hot Dance Club Play Chart, spending nine weeks on the chart. A promotional video was shot and released for \"Alice Everyday\" by director Rocky Schenck. There are two versions of the video, one that uses the album version of \"Alice Everyday\" and the other, the 'Everyday Glo Mix' version of the song. The video emulates the \"Candy Carol\" album cover, showing the band dancing and performing inside of snow globes, wearing outfits similar to the album cover.\n\nBook of Love's third album \"Candy Carol\" was finally released on January 23, 1991 with twelve tracks, and sold 60,000 copies in the first week of release. The album spent four weeks on the \"Billboard\" 200, peaking at no. 174, the second best placing of their career. The album sleeve, designed by Jade Lee and photographed by Marc David Cohen, is of a crafted snow globe with miniatures of the band members performing amid falling snowflakes.\n\nThe second single taken from the album was \"Sunny Day\", with its sun-kissed guitars, bells, and arpeggiated harps. It became the second Book of Love song to feature Ted Ottaviano on lead vocals. The single from the album that failed to make the Billboard charts but was featured in Jonathan Demme's 1991 film \"The Silence of the Lambs\". In a strange twist of fate, Lauren Roselli was cast in the role of Stacy Hubka in the movie.\n\nThe third and final single from the album was \"Counting the Rosaries\", featuring Lauren Roselli on lead vocals, a whistling section, and Marc Roselli, a Jesuit priest and brother to Lauren Roselli, singing the Sanctus on the track. The song failed to make an impact on the charts.\n\nTo promote \"Candy Carol\", the band headlined their own Candy Carol Tour of small clubs in the spring of 1991 with various local acts opening in each city. The band's U.S. tour lasted for three months, with dates spanning March 2 through June 1 of 1991.\n\nBefore work began on the band's fourth album, the band had an important band meeting. In a 2009 interview, Susan Ottaviano explained, \"We asked each other, 'Do you think we can do it again?' The '80s were over and we were ushering in the '90s with bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. The funny thing is, when you're out there touring, you just think it's going to keep going on and on and on.\"\n\nThe band recorded the album in New York City at Unique Recording, the same studios where they recorded parts of their previous three records. Ted Ottaviano produced the record, making it his first time solely in the producer's seat. The album contained mixed styles and creative ideas from all four members of the group, with each member taking a turn as lead vocalist. The songs \"Tambourine\", \"Flower In My Hand\", and \"Enchanted\" dated back to the early days of the band and were more in the style of the first two albums, while \"Boy Pop\" and \"Chatterbox (Pt. 2)\" moved in a new club-oriented direction. \"We were more fractured as a band. This fracture paved the way to a more open, freer recording process. We accepted each other more\"\n\nThe track \"Sunday A.M.\" was inspired by Junior Vasquez and Ted Ottaviano and Lauren Roselli's Sunday mornings at The Sound Factory in New York City. \"Happily Ever After\" featured Lauren Roselli on lead vocals, and a lyric about counting each of twelve tears after a breakup. The song contained a sample of The 5th Dimension's hit \"Aquarius\". The album also contains two cover songs. The first, \"Sound and Vision\", originally was done by David Bowie, who is one of the band's biggest heroes and inspirations. \"Woyaya\", originally done by Ghanaian Afro-pop group Osibisa and later covered by Art Garfunkel, features Ted Ottaviano on lead vocals, a lone drum beat, and the ambient noise of a city protest.\n\nBefore the album release, the band released the first single \"Boy Pop\" in May 1993, a dance track and ode to gay men, with its lyric of \"brother love ... across the nation ... on the bottom or the top, when we go, we go pop ... boys united cannot be divided...\". The song became a huge club hit, peaking at no. 4 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. A promotional video was shot showing the band at a club/bar and many muscular fit dancers.\n\nBook of Love released their fourth record, \"Lovebubble\", on June 15, 1993, almost two years after their previous album, 1991's \"Candy Carol\". \"Lovebubble\" did not chart, and was released to little fanfare amidst the changing musical tides of the early nineties with grunge dominating the alternative landscape. The album's cover sleeve, a tic tac toe square of nine different images, was designed by Talking Heads' frontman David Byrne.\n\nThe second and final single taken from the record was \"Hunny Hunny\"/\"Chatterbox (Pt. 2)\", a double A-side single, released in September 1993. \"Hunny Hunny\" featured Lauren Roselli on lead vocals, nursery rhyme lyrics, and cascading arpeggiated synths. In contrast, the flip side, \"Chatterbox (Pt. 2)\", penned by Jade Lee, featured Jade on lead vocals spouting off a stream-of-consciousness lyric to a house flavored backing track. Neither song charted.\n\nThe album track \"Enchanted\" was included on the soundtrack to the 1993 film \"Naked in New York\".\n\nTo promote \"Lovebubble\", the band played a small tour of a few select small clubs in early 1994. Following the small tour, the band went their separate ways before Book of Love became obsolete.\n\nSpeaking about the 1990s in an interview, Susan Ottaviano stated, \"Melody was sort of falling by the wayside and getting into a little bit more of the riffs and some of the things that we didn't fit as well, and I think that also we were having the growing pains in the band and in general about how to move forward.\" In a 2013 interview, Ted Ottaviano explained, \"I wouldn't just say that grunge killed it. I just think it wasn't apparent that basically, musically, audiences had changed and they wanted to hear different things. We did. We were as much of a music participant as anyone else. Most of the electronic music became more dance oriented, and techno and house [industrial] went towards that direction, and then more alternative music went back to a really traditional sort of almost rock or post-punk sort of vein. It felt like the synth pop songs that we were doing didn't feel like they had a place at that moment, in a strange way, even for us. You could feel the tide change. We could've continued going on if we wanted to, we just basically felt we had sort of done our thing at that point.\"\n\nIn 2001, Reprise Records released Book of Love's first and only 'best of' collection: \"\", effectively fulfilling the band's Warner Bros. recording contract. It had been eight years since the release of \"Lovebubble\", the band's eclectic final album. In the late 1990s, with the emerging electroclash scene and electronic dance music back in vogue, the musical environment was ready for Book of Love again.\nIn 2000, the band worked away at Sound Umbrella studio in New York City, preparing new songs for the release. Three new songs were recorded for the album. \"Getting Faster\", penned by Susan Ottaviano and Ted Ottaviano, was a dance pop number with lyrics of \"slowing down and getting faster ... blue sky won't go up and up.\" A new track \"Try\", a collaboration between Jade Lee and Ted Ottaviano, featured both Susan Ottaviano and Jade on lead vocals, and a classic Book of Love arrangement. \"It's In Your Eyes\" was an old track that dated back to the very beginnings of Book of Love. Taking things full circle, the song was the first song originally written by Susan and Ted Ottaviano, and the band resurrected it and recorded it for the first time for inclusion on the compilation. It had only been performed live, but its inclusion is a \"real gift to the earliest fans\". Ted Ottaviano stated, \"This is a perfect time for a retrospective. We've added great new material and we can look back at our whole body of work with real objectivity.\"\n\nAnother new production on the compilation was a reworking of the song \"Sunny Day\". Ted Ottaviano produced the new version which included guitar from Lori Lindsay, who would later collaborate with Ted Ottaviano and Lauren (Roselli) Johnson as lead vocalist and guitarist in The Myrmidons.\n\n\"I Touch Roses: The Best of Book of Love\" was released on March 13, 2001, with sixteen tracks spanning the group's entire catalog. The compilation album failed to chart on the Billboard charts. The only singles omitted from the collection were \"Witchcraft\" and \"Boy Pop\", along with fan favorite album cuts such as \"With A Little Love\", \"Turn The World\", and \"Sound and Vision\".\n\nThe only single released from the record was a newly remixed version of \"Boy\" by DJ-Producer Peter Rauhofer in January 2001. \"Boy\", originally an Ivan Ivan production from the band's eponymous debut, was given a new life with additional new production from Peter. \"Boy\" (Peter Rauhofer Remix) became a huge club hit, peaking at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. Speaking about the remix, Ted Ottaviano stated, \"Peter was a huge fan of the song, and he wanted to do it. It really has the essence of the original.\"\n\nDouble 12 inch vinyl promo copies of the \"Boy\" remixes were already making an impact in the clubs at the end of 2000. Between the two formats of 2 x 12 inch vinyl and CD, there are 10 new remix versions of \"Boy\", all done by Peter Rauhofer, Headrillaz, RPO, Dubaholics, and Sound Bisquit. A second remix of \"Boy\" also made it to no. 2 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart.\n\nA promotional video of the remix of \"Boy\" (Big Red Mix) was released featuring montage live footage of the band's performance of \"Boy\" from the Concert Against Aids Benefit at The Gift Center, San Francisco, on May 28, 1989.\n\nDue to the success of the \"Boy\" remixes, Reprise Records commissioned a new remix of \"I Touch Roses\" by Markus Schulz to further promote the compilation. A promotional 12 inch of \"I Touch Roses\" (Markus Schulz Dark Rose Remix) backed with an instrumental remix version was released in the spring of 2001. In additional support of the greatest hits collection, the band temporarily reunited to play a small scale club tour visited cities spanning coast to coast in 2001. Following the small tour, the band went their separate ways once again.\n\nIn a March 2001 interview, Ted Ottaviano explained how the band attracted a gay audience. \"Even with our first hit, 'Boy', the song was really about a bigger idea. It was about feeling different, wanting to be a part of something, and making your own way in spite of that.\"\n\nOn July 21, 2009, the music company Collector's Choice/Noble Rot released remastered and expanded editions of Book of Love's entire catalog. It marked the first time many of the band's remixes were available digitally.\n\nThe band's debut album \"Book of Love\" was released as a special Silver Anniversary Edition with a bonus disc containing five demos, two remixes, two live tracks, an instrumental, and the band's hard to find cover of \"We Three Kings\".\n\nThe band's second album \"Lullaby\" was remastered and reissued as a single disc containing five bonus tracks, including the 14:25 minute medley of \"Tubular Bells/Pretty Boys And Pretty Girls\" and the hard to find B-side \"Enchantra\".\n\n\"Candy Carol\", the band's third album, was also remastered and reissued on a single disc with four bonus tracks, including the industrial tinged remix of \"Alice Everyday\" (Sam the Butcher Mix).\n\nThe band's final album \"Lovebubble\" was remastered and reissued as a single disc with four bonus tracks, including two remixes of the dance smash \"Boy Pop\".\n\nIn celebration of the reissued albums and 25 years since recording \"Boy\", the quartet came together yet again for a one night only show on September 27, 2009 at the Highline Ballroom in New York City.\n\nOn April 27, 2013 Book of Love once again reformed to play a one off show in Houston, Texas at Numbers Night Club. Ted Ottaviano, Lauren Johnson (formerly Roselli) and singer Susan Ottaviano performed the show as a trio, as keyboardist Jade Lee was unable to attend. Most all of the hits were played with some new samples and instrumentation.\n\nIn a 2013 podcast interview, Ted Ottaviano explained Jade's absence, \"Jade is creatively involved with us whenever we work on any new material. She's still a Book of Love band member. This is something from when we first disbanded in the '90s, this was the thing she basically didn't really feel as interested in pursuing with us. And on select shows, if she can be there, she will.\" Ted also revealed in the interview that David Bowie's surprise announcement of his album \"The Next Day\" had been the catalyst for the reunion. \"I feel like we're all in a place where we would like to work on new music ... David Bowie has been a major influence on us our whole career. And even seeing him make his new album, it's just been so inspiring. In a weird way we remain music fans as much as musicians ourselves and we have been talking about it. We just take one step at a time. So, the first thing is to go down to Texas and see how this show feels. There's also been talk here and there maybe about doing another date, but nothing concrete yet.\"\n\nThe band eventually announced a string of five California tour dates scheduled for October 2013 (MMXIII).\n\nOn June 13, 2013, the band posted on their Facebook page announcing that Book of Love is working on new material during the summer of 2013, and will play new songs during their fall tour dates in California.\n\nOn June 17, 2016, Sire/Rhino Records celebrated the 30th anniversary of the band's eponymous debut album by releasing a new compilation titled \"MMXVI - Book of Love - The 30th Anniversary Collection\". The release features re-mastered versions of their hits, unreleased demos, and two brand new tracks: \"All Girl Band\" and \"Something Good\". To further commemorate this anniversary, the band played a reunion show in New York City (June 23, 2016) with all four members reunited together to perform for the first time in many years. \"All Girl Band\" was released as a single to promote the compilation, as well as a lyrics video of the song featuring different shots of the single's artwork.\n\nOn January 19, 2018, Notefornote Music and Rhino Records released \"The Sire Years: 1985-1993\", a CD anthology of newly remastered fan favorites culled from the band's first four albums. Earlier that month, the band announced a North American tour in support of the project.\n\nIn 1993, Ted Ottaviano began collaborating with vocalist Basil Lucas on a dance music project called Doubleplusgood, a term meaning \"excellent\" or \"splendid\", taken from George Orwell's novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". Doubleplusgood released a total of five songs from 1993 through 1997: \"Conga Té\", \"Theme From Doubleplusgood\", \"Sunny Day\" (w/Lambert Moss on lead vocals), \"The Winding Song\", and \"Boogala\". Doubleplusgood had a couple significant dance club hits with \"Conga Té\" reaching no. 12 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart in 1993, and \"The Winding Song\", reaching no. 2 in 1996.\n\nThroughout the rest of the 1990s, Ted Ottaviano continued work doing the following remixes for other artists: The Heads' \"Damage I've Done\" (Sound Bisquit Vocal Mix) in 1996, Fleetwood Mac's \"Landslide\" (3 Remixes) in 1997, David Byrne's \"Wicked Little Doll\" (Valley of the Doll Parts Dub Mix) in 1997, and two remixes of Hole's \"Malibu\" in 1999. In the mid-2000s, he also produced the New York City band Dangerous Muse's \"The Rejection EP\" and \"Give Me Danger\" EP, as well as the group The Ones, and many other local dance bands.\n\nAmong other work, Ted Ottaviano has scored a film short by photographer Steven Klein, as well as doing music for Klein's art installation with Madonna, titled X-STaTIC PRO=CeSS.\n\nSusan Ottaviano attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park and the Institute of Culinary Education in NYC. She is a respected and sought after food stylist and recipe developer that is known for \"her creative and painterly approach to food.\" Her work has been described as \"modern, fresh and effortlessly composed.\" She has styled food for ads by Macy's, Godiva, Post Foods, Kraft Foods, and also various cookbooks. Her work appeared in magazines such as \"Bon Appétit\", \"Cooking Light\", \"Men's Health\", \"Every Day with Rachael Ray\", and \"Oprah Magazine\".\n\nIn 2003, Susan Ottaviano collaborated with Sean Niles and Andrew Wilson of darkwave band Exhibition, providing lead vocals to a cover version of Joy Division's \"She's Lost Control\". The song was released on the mix compilation CD \"Kill The DJ: A Non-Stop Mash-Up Mix By Keoki\" by DJ Keoki.\n\nLauren Roselli married and became Lauren Johnson. She continued with acting roles and appeared in the films \"Philadelphia\" in 1993, \"Beloved\" in 1998, and \"The Manchurian Candidate\" in 2004. She is a mother and continues to pursue her art through photography and video as well as contribute to the music of The Myrmidons.\n\nJade Lee is a graphic designer and artist, and still contributes creatively to Book of Love while preferring not to tour with the band.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, former Book of Love band members Ted Ottaviano and Lauren (Roselli) Johnson formed a new band called The Myrmidons, a reference to the name of a mythical race of ant people. They recruited former singer and guitarist of The Prissteens, Lori Lindsay, an acquaintance of Lauren (Roselli) Johnson, because she was a \"musical kindred spirit.\" The sound of The Myrmidons is a modern throwback to the 1960s pop idiom, and showcases a love for melodies, chords, and bells. In a 2013 podcast interview, Ted Ottaviano described The Myrmidons as a \"'90s band\", and a branch off the tree of the 90's post-punk/electronic bands such as Garbage and Elastica, leading up through the new millennia on the cusp of The Strokes. \nThe Myrmidons have released four EPs, and nine original songs total.\n\nIn 2006, the band released their first two EPs: \"The Myrmidons EP\" with three songs: \"Clap (See The Stars)\", \"Dirty Secret\", and \"My Favorite\"; and \"The Clap EP\" with the songs: \"Clap (See The Stars)\", \"Clap (See The Stars)\" [Better Late Mix], and \"What Color Is Love?\" The song \"Clap (See The Stars)\" was featured on the \"Another Gay Soundtrack\", the soundtrack for the movie \"Another Gay Movie\", released on July 28, 2006.\n\nIn 2008, the band released the \"Golden Toys EP\", which contained three new songs: \"Golden Toys Pt. 1\", \"Golden Toys Pt. 2\", and \"Andy Is\".\n\nOn February 5, 2013, they released \"The Blue EP\" online. The EP contains two new songs, \"So I Cried\" (Le Bleu Mix) and \"Dizzy\", as well as a new mix of \"Clap (See The Stars)\" (The Blue Mix).\n\nOn September 29, 2015, a compilation titled: \"THE GOLDEN TOYS, The Myrmidons compiled (2005-2015)\" was released digitally as a 10 song retrospective, and included one new track \"Happy Together\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2207516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207516", "title": "Night of the Long Knives (1962)", "text": "Night of the Long Knives (1962)\n\nIn British politics, the \"Night of the Long Knives\" was a major Cabinet reshuffle that took place on 13 July 1962. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan dismissed seven members of his Cabinet, one-third of the total. The speed and scale of the reshuffle caused it to be associated by its critics with the 1934 Night of the Long Knives in Nazi Germany.\n\nThe reshuffle took place against a backdrop of declining Conservative popularity in Britain. Conservative candidates fared poorly in several by-elections, losing ground to Liberal candidates. Concerned that traditional Conservative voters were expressing their disapproval with the government's economic policies by switching to the Liberals, Harold Macmillan planned to replace his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Selwyn Lloyd, with Reginald Maudling. Lloyd had already clashed with Macmillan over his economic strategies, and Maudling was considered to be more amenable to the economic policies Macmillan wished to implement. The reshuffle was also an attempt to reinvigorate the party, bringing in younger and more dynamic figures and replacing some of the older and less capable ministers. After discussions with Conservative Party chairman Iain Macleod and Home Secretary Rab Butler, a reshuffle was planned for Autumn 1962.\n\nMacmillan was overtaken by events when Butler leaked the details of the reshuffle to press baron Lord Rothermere over lunch on 11 July. The newspapers reported the impending changes on 12 July, and Macmillan made the decision to press ahead with the reshuffle at once. Lloyd was called to a meeting that evening and dismissed. The remaining six were informed the following day, 13 July. Macmillan faced sharp criticism over the scale of the changes, and his political opponents both within the Conservative Party and in the Opposition characterised him as ruthless and opportunistic. Despite an initial sharp drop in his approval ratings, opinion eventually swung back in his favour and the Party recovered. Macmillan regretted the way the reshuffle was carried out, and was particularly concerned about his treatment of Lloyd, who was a loyal confidant. Despite the dramatic changes in the Cabinet, the Conservatives were rocked by a series of scandals in 1963 and Macmillan retired in October of that year after being misdiagnosed with cancer. He was replaced as Prime Minister by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who was defeated in the 1964 general election.\n\nThe Conservatives won a convincing majority at the 1959 general election, increasing their lead over their nearest rivals, Labour. The Labour party were further weakened by internal disputes, but the Conservatives' economic policies unveiled in the 1960 Budget proved damaging. The tax cuts of 1959 were reversed, decreasing the government's popularity while the Liberals began a revival. The Conservatives were forced into third place in several by-elections, culminating in the loss of the previously safe seat of Orpington (neighbouring Macmillan's Bromley seat) in a March 1962 by-election victory for the Liberal candidate, Eric Lubbock. The by-election result, announced on 14 March, came one day after the Blackpool North by-election, another former Conservative safe seat; though the Conservative candidate Norman Miscampbell succeeded in holding the Blackpool North seat, the previous majority of 15,587 was reduced to just 973 by the Liberal candidate, Harry Hague. The Conservatives were struggling with deep unpopularity over their economic policies. A pay-pause and rising prices, together with discontent at high taxation that was demonstrably inequitable, drove voters to protest against government policies by switching their votes to the Liberals, or by abstaining from voting Conservative.\n\nMacmillan saw in the by-election results evidence that former Conservative voters would abandon their candidates in support of the Liberals, who were well placed in Conservative safe seats. In instances where the Liberals had no candidate standing, such as the Labour safe seat of Pontefract, the Conservatives maintained their share of the vote. When a Liberal candidate was fielded, such as at the Stockton-on-Tees by-election in April, in a seat Macmillan himself formerly held, the Conservatives saw large numbers of voters desert them for the Liberals. Later by-elections confirmed the trend. By July the Chairman of the Conservative Party Iain Macleod warned that a government reshuffle was necessary to revitalise flagging support, a view confirmed by Martin Redmayne, the Conservative Chief Whip. Macmillan met with Rab Butler on 21 June. With Conservative unpopularity stemming from economic issues, they discussed replacing Selwyn Lloyd as Chancellor of the Exchequer with Reginald Maudling. Lloyd and Macmillan had already clashed over economic policy: Lloyd was opposed to an incomes policy and reflation, and his austerity measures were causing discontent.\n\nThe Cabinet was also relatively elderly, and with younger political leaders on the scene, like American President John F. Kennedy, at a time of dramatic social changes, Macmillan resolved to bring some younger men into important posts. The seven ministers earmarked for replacement averaged 59 years of age. The incoming seven would have an average age of 50. Butler was in favour of the move, and together with Macleod, they worked out an orderly reshuffle of several Cabinet posts, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In all, seven ministers were to be replaced, amounting to one third of the total Cabinet of twenty-one.\n\nMacmillan intended to carry out the reshuffle in autumn 1962 after parliament returned from its summer recess. Events overtook him when, on 11 July, Butler lunched with Lord Rothermere, proprietor of several newspapers, including the \"Daily Mail\". Butler let slip the details of the impending reshuffle, and the following day the \"Daily Mail\" broke the plans to the public with the headline \"Mac's Master Plan\". A horrified Macmillan, suspecting that the plans were deliberately leaked by Butler to further his political career, felt compelled to act. He summoned Lloyd to a meeting that evening and informed him that he was to be replaced as Chancellor. He attempted to mollify Lloyd by suggesting that he consider a career in the city as chairman of Martins Bank, and hinted at the possibility of a peerage. Lloyd refused both. The remaining six officeholders were informed the following day, 13 July. Mills, Maclay and Watkinson were reported to have gone quietly, as did Hill, though he expressed his disapproval on the way the reshuffle was handled. Eccles and Kilmuir were the most disappointed, Eccles having hoped to succeed as Chancellor, and Kilmuir later writing that Macmillan appeared to have lost his 'nerve and judgement'. The reshuffle was completed three days later with the removal of nine junior ministers.\n\nMacmillan suggested on several occasions, including at his meeting with Lloyd to dismiss him as Chancellor, that he felt there was a conspiracy within the party to replace him as Prime Minister. While the run of poor Conservative results led to informal talk among party MPs and ministers, no such conspiracy existed. His intimations of party disloyalty and the speed and surprise of the sackings were particularly hurtful to Lloyd, who was loyal to Macmillan, and remained so even after his dismissal.\n\nThe speed and size of the reshuffle was unprecedented in British political history, and would not be exceeded until the formation of the Johnson ministry in 2019. The sackings were mockingly named after the 1934 Night of the Long Knives, when Adolf Hitler had many Sturmabteilung supporters of Ernst Röhm either executed or arrested. Macmillan was accused of having acted hastily and of being ungrateful in sacking his party's most loyal officials. His reputation of being calm and unflappable in a crisis was badly tarnished, and his ratings in opinion polls fell sharply. His political opponents made capital from this: Liberal MP Jeremy Thorpe, in a humorous twist on a biblical phrase, observed that \"Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his friends for his life.\" Lloyd was cheered on his next appearance in the House on 17 July, while Macmillan was faced with silence from his own benches, and jeers from the opposition. The opposition tabled a motion of censure against Macmillan, which was debated on 26 July. Macmillan also faced divisions within his own party. Conservative MP Gilbert Longden, employing a similar humorous twist on Rudyard Kipling's \"If—\", congratulated him on keeping his head, while all around him were losing theirs. Former Prime Minister Anthony Eden and former Minister Nigel Birch also voiced their disapproval. Despite these voices of dissent, the reaction from most Conservative MPs was positive.\n\nThe damage was relatively short-lived. Macmillan's position improved within a few months of the affair. Butler was moved from the position of Home Secretary and appointed First Secretary of State. Macmillan made out that it was the equivalent of Deputy Prime Minister, a post that had lapsed after 1955. It was in actuality a demotion. Butler was tasked with overseeing the Central African Office, which moved him away from the more powerful state offices. With Lloyd replaced as Chancellor by Maudling, Macmillan pushed ahead with reflation. The more cautious Lloyd had rejected reflation because of the risk of ultimately damaging the economy with a balance of payments crisis. Maudling however was prepared to accept the devaluation of sterling and the placement of controls on imports to stave off this eventuality. By the time of the party conference Macmillan's popularity within his party had largely recovered. Maudling reversed Lloyd's austerity measures that November, following this up with cutting the tax on motor cars, and reducing the bank rate and purchase tax. In the Spring 1963 budget he abolished the Schedule A tax, one of the main causes of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives, and a move which Lloyd had resisted. Liberal fortunes, which rested largely on the unpopularity of these policies, declined thereafter. Labour recovered by early 1963 as the exceptionally harsh winter that year drove up unemployment and the economy unexpectedly faltered.\n\nMacmillan regretted the way the reshuffle was carried out, and was particularly guilt-ridden over how he treated his former confidante, Lloyd. He arranged a meeting with Lloyd on 1 August 1962, before which Macmillan's private secretary, Tim Bligh, informed Lloyd that \"He [Macmillan] is spending all the time thinking of how to bring you back.\" Macmillan apologised to Lloyd, saying that he had made a mistake in not discussing it with him beforehand, and that he was rushed, his hand was forced. He again mentioned a conspiracy, suggesting that \"Butler had been plotting to divide the party on the Common Market, and bring him [Macmillan] down.\"\n\nDespite the upswing in the Conservatives' fortunes which followed after the disapproval over the reshuffle abated, the Party suffered further problems. Macmillan's government was rocked by the Vassall and Profumo affairs the following year, and Macmillan decided to step down in October 1963, citing ill-health. He was replaced as Prime Minister by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, but the Conservatives were defeated in the 1964 general election by Labour under Harold Wilson.\n\n"}

Mayer USN, Commanding. \"Glacier\" is the only icebreaker built in the \"Glacier\" class, and was in U.S. Navy service for 11 years, and U.S. Coast Guard service for 21 years.\n\n\"Glacier\" was essentially an improved , larger and more powerful. Like them, her entire hull was designed for great strength. With a relatively short length in proportion to the great power developed, her bow had the characteristic sloping forefoot that enabled her to ride up on heavy ice and break it with the weight of the vessel. The stern was similarly shaped to facilitate breaking ice while backing down. The sides of the icebreaker were rounded, with marked tumblehome, and she had fore, aft and side heeling tanks that enabled the ship to break free from ice by heeling from side to side and changing trim fore to aft. Diesel electric machinery was chosen for its controlability and resistance to damage.\n\n\"Glacier\"s shakedown cruise and maiden voyage were combined in \"Operation Deep Freeze I\", as flagship for Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd. Her first encounter with the ice was in December 1955, breaking through the Ross Ice Pack, she carved out an ice harbor in Kainan Bay to allow the discharge of cargo from vessels at the site for Little America V. \"Glacier\" continued west to break ice into an off-loading site to establish the U.S. Naval Air Facility at McMurdo Sound. In March 1956, \"Glacier\" explored the Weddell Sea. \"Glacier\" then surveyed Vincennes Bay in Wilkes Land and made the first landing in history on the Princess Martha and Princess Astrid coasts. \"Glacier\" returned to Boston, her home port, on 6 May 1956 after these accomplishments.\n\nThe ship returned to McMurdo Sound on 28 October 1956 for \"Deep Freeze II\", having made the earliest seasonal penetration in history. \"Glacier\" then delivered stores and supplies at McMurdo and then Little America, she led seven other ships of the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) through the ice pack to the two Antarctic bases. In January 1957 she led two cargo ships into Vincennes Bay where the last of the seven American bases for the International Geophysical Year was to be constructed. \"Glacier\" departed Wilkes Station on 17 February 1957 for the United States via Melbourne, Australia when the operation was completed.\n\nDuring \"Deep Freeze III\" and the IGY of 1957–1958, \"Glacier\" participated as a launching platform for \"rockoon\" tests during which balloon-lifted rockets gathered information of interest to the \"Explorer\" space satellite program. Additionally, \"Glacier\" continued her usual icebreaking and escort duties, and conducted oceanographic surveys in the Ross Sea.\n\nIn the summer of 1958, \"Glacier\" provided ice-escort for \"Operation Sunec\" for the resupply of North Polar radar and weather stations. By November 1958, however, she was again near the South Pole at McMurdo Sound, and after resupplying the base, steamed to Little America V to begin the station deactivation. Subsequently, while operating in the Terra Nova Bay on the coast of Victoria Land, she discovered two unknown islands and what was likely the largest emperor penguin rookery in the Antarctic, home of over 50,000 of the large birds. \"Glacier\" then sped to the assistance of the Belgian expedition ship RV \"Polarhav\" near Breid Bay, halfway around the Antarctic continent from the Ross Sea.\n\nFor \"Operation Deep Freeze 5\" in 1959–1960, \"Glacier\" sailed to McMurdo and then on an exploration of the Bellingshausen Sea. In late February 1960 \"Glacier\" raced to assist Argentine Navy icebreaker and Danish cargo ship . When this rescue mission was accomplished, \"Glacier\" sailed to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 2 April 1960 and provided emergency assistance to flooded areas there for twelve days. \"Glacier\" also did relief operations; providing helicopter and boat transportation, and emergency supplies to residents of Paramaribo, Suriname after the floods. \"Glacier\" then got underway for Boston, Massachusetts on 17 April 1960.\n\nThe icebreaker departed Boston on 13 October 1960 on her sixth Antarctic voyage and reached Lyttelton, New Zealand on 21 November 1960 to unload cargo. Most of December 1960 was spent in breaking a channel through McMurdo Sound to open the way for supply ships. \"Glacier\" returned to Wellington, New Zealand for repairs, and to receive the U.S. Navy Unit Commendation for her Bellingshausen Sea expedition success. She then returned to the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas on another expedition. Oceanographic work continued until March 1961 when she sailed for Boston, arriving on 27 April 1961.\n\nUnderway again on 8 October 1961 for \"Deep Freeze 62\", she loaded cargo at Lyttelton, New Zealand, in early November 1961 and entered the Ross Sea ice pack on 13 November 1961, reaching McMurdo Sound by the end of the month. After repairs at Wellington, \"Glacier\" returned to McMurdo Station and to the site of Little America V for cartographic studies. She returned to New Zealand on 6 March 1962 and then put in at Boston on 5 May 1962 after steaming .\n\n\"Glacier\" stood out of Boston on 17 September 1962 for \"Deep Freeze 63\", entering the pack ice on 6 November 1962 and reaching the edge of the bay ice of McMurdo Sound a week later. \"Glacier\" sustained minor damage in the thick ice and proceeded to Wellington for repairs. On 31 December 1962, \"Glacier\" cut through McMurdo Sound en route to McMurdo Station. She continued operations off McMurdo Station through 1965. Her diverse duties included keeping the channel open for supply ships. On 29 December 1965, US ships \"Atka\" and assisted her in pushing an iceberg out of the shipping lane. After further participation in her 11th \"Operation Deep Freeze\", \"Glacier\" returned to Boston in the late spring of 1966. On 1 July 1966, \"Glacier\" was struck from the Navy List, the day after her transfer to the United States Coast Guard.\n\nPrior to her transfer to the U.S. Coast Guard, \"Glacier\" had her smaller armament removed. In September 1967, \"Glacier\" departed her new homeport of Long Beach, California en route to the Chukchi Sea north of Cape Lisbourne, Alaska, to aid in the rescue of , beset in Arctic ice. The Canadian icebreaker had freed \"Northwind\" by the time of \"Glacier\"s arrival. \"Glacier\" departed Arctic waters to sail to Port Lyttelton, to start Operation Deep Freeze 1967–68. Due to the \"Northwind\" rescue trip, \"Glacier\" had crossed the Arctic Circle, International Dateline, Equator, and Antarctic Circle lines all within six weeks, attaining \"Square Knot Sailor\" status in that short time frame. \"Glacier\" and other USCG icebreakers opened up the McMurdo shipping lanes, then returned to Port Lyttelton. At that time an experimental navigational satellite (NavSat) system was installed in \"Glacier\" by the Applied Physics Lab of Johns Hopkins University, to allow precise positioning in the upcoming exploration in the Weddell Sea. \"Glacier\" transited the South Pacific Ocean to Punta Arenas, Chile and the Magellan Straits, then entered the Weddell Sea as lead vessel for the 1968 International Weddell Sea Oceanographic Expedition. \"Glacier\" occupied most of the scheduled oceanographic sampling stations in the Weddell Sea. Current meter arrays were set with the precise positioning of the NavSat system. These stations were to be revisited in three years, and the current meters sonic-released for data collection. The heavy fast ice in the Weddell Sea thwarted the scheduled retrieval of this array, until 1975.\n\n\"Glacier\" visited the new Palmer Station on Anvers Island, after , to retrieve USN Seabees and transport them to Punta Arenas for eventual transit back to Davisville, Rhode Island. While departing Arthur Harbor at Palmer Station, \"Glacier\" was astern of . \"Southwind\" ran aground on an uncharted pinnacle (now called Southwind Rock), tearing out an section of hull. \"Glacier\" escorted the damaged \"Southwind\" across the Drake Passage] to Puntas Arena, then up the West coast of South America to the Panama Canal. \"Glacier\" then departed Panama Canal for Long Beach.\n\nIn 1968, the 5-inch guns were also removed. Only the M2 Browning machine guns, M60 machine guns and small arms were retained for law enforcement purposes. During 1973, she and her helicopters were painted red for improved Arctic visibility.\n\nIn 1975, \"Glacier\" was trapped in ice in Antarctica for six days, finally breaking free and escaping into the waters of Antarctic Sound on 10 March 1975. \"She backed and rammed her way to the open sea with the use of only one of her two propellers,\" said the Coast Guard. Two of the three blades on her other screw were sheared off by \"steel hard ice\" on Wednesday 5 March, while en route to assist an Argentine icebreaker, ARA \"General San Martín\", which had engine trouble while on a supply mission to a south polar scientific base. The Argentine ship made its way to freedom on its own.\n\nFollowing 29 Antarctic and 10 Arctic deployments, \"Glacier\" was decommissioned in 1987. She went under the control of the U.S. Maritime Administration, located in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay, on the Sacramento River, California. The Glacier Society saved \"Glacier\" from the scrapyard in 2000, and planned to convert the ship into a hospital or research vessel. However, on 16 February 2012 \"Glacier\" was sold for $146,726 to be broken up by ESCO Marine in Brownsville, Texas. Efforts to save the vessel from the breakers continued as the ship was taken to the former naval base at Mare Island, Vallejo, on 17 April 2012 for cleaning. Nevertheless, she was towed away to Brownsville, arriving on 19 June. A last-minute stay of execution was rejected, and MARAD ordered her scrapping to begin on 2 July 2012.\n\n\n\n"}

Nine schools (five elementary, two middle, and two high schools) comprise the school district.\n\nThe district has two high schools (East and West), two middle schools (Candlewood and West Hollow), and five elementary schools (Otsego, Paumanok, Signal Hill, Sunquam and Vanderbilt).\n\nHalf Hollow Hills East\n\nHigh School East is located at 50 Vanderbilt Parkway in Dix Hills, New York, across the street from the Half Hollow Hills Community Library - Dix Hills building. Hills East is fed from West Hollow Middle School and is the larger of the two high schools in the district. The current principal is Milton Strong. The building was once expanded in the 1960s and used as both a junior high and a high school, which were located side-by-side and connected to one another, making the building a sprawling structure divided into two wings. For this reason, Hills East has redundant facilities: two main offices, two nurses' offices, two gymnasiums (and two pairs of men's and women's locker rooms), two auditoriums (a main theater and a lecture hall), and three cafeterias (one has since been converted to a weight room). The class of 1978 was the last class where East was the exclusive high school in the district; commencing in 1979 there were graduating classes from both high schools. In 2013, Half Hollow Hills High School East ranked #314 on Newsweek's list of Best High Schools in America. The Hills East school mascot is the Thunderbird, which wears the school colors of red, black, and white.\n\nHigh School East uniquely features a domed planetarium, located one floor above the principal's office in the newer west wing. It houses a Spitz A3P planetarium projector, and is generally used to host class trips from the middle and elementary schools. It is also the home of the Hills East Astronomy Club, where students are taught about the night sky, astronomy and mythology by fellow students and teachers.\n\nHigh School East's other main attraction and centerpiece is the Eugene Orloff Auditorium, a two-level theater boasting a seating capacity of 2200, making it the second largest not-for-profit auditorium on Long Island. It hosts a variety of school events throughout the year, such as student concerts, musicals, awards ceremonies and graduations. The space is also rented out to local arts/cultural organizations and companies for concerts, meetings and other events throughout the year. The stage is a full Broadway-sized stage (88 feet wide, 49 feet deep, three stories tall for fly space (hanging scenery). The stage has an orchestra pit containing two pistons (although only one functions) that are capable of raising and lowering the pit. The Eugene Orloff Auditorium is infamous for its low-quality acoustics, as it was constructed of concrete and never completed. The music wing of the school is located in the hallway running behind the stagehouse.\n\nThe school also has a lecture hall, located in the older east wing. Recently renovated, It is usually the host of small gatherings and meetings, as well as Advanced Placement exams.\n\nHalf Hollow Hills West\n\nHigh School West, also known as Hills West, is located at 375 Wolf Hill Road in Dix Hills, New York. In 2013, Newsweek ranked West #248 on its Best High Schools in America list. In the 2011–2012 school year, it had 1,480 students and 101 teachers, for a student/teacher ratio of 14.68. The school's demographics are 63% white, 16% black, 6% Hispanic, 14% Asian/Pacific Islander, and less than 1% American Indian, Alaskan, or two or more races. Its male–female ratio is 53–47. The school receives Title I funding and 11% of its students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.\n\nThe school was built in 1975 and in its first year was 10th grade only, for class of '78. After its first year of classes, the district was split and the two high schools became typical 10, 11, 12 grade each. It includes a track, turf field, and natatorium. The Half Hollow Hills Natatorium is adjacent to Ms. B's Trap Garden and the \"North Cafeteria\" and is primarily used for swim meets, community events, gym classes, and occasional school trips from the other schools within the district. The school grounds of High School West are adjacent to those of Signal Hill Elementary School, which is located at the intersection of Wolf Hill Road and Caledonia Road. West students generally attend Candlewood Middle School from 6th to 8th grade. As of 2019, Michael Catapano serves as the principal of Hills West.\n\nHills West has been successful in a variety of sports including Cross Country, Track, Football, Baseball, Basketball, Soccer, Swim, Dance, and Volleyball. In 2009, the Cross Country team won the Suffolk County A Championship. In 2010, they once again won the Suffolk County A Championship, however a disqualification of one of the runners led them to take second place. The winter track team won 7 straight county titles (2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011) and in the spring of 2007, 2008 and 2009 the spring track team has won the league by going undefeated. In addition, the Colts have fielded strong baseball teams over the years, winning multiple league titles, two county championships, and a state championship in 2003 under the coaching Thomas Migliozzi who recently accomplished his 500th win as the head coach. The Varsity Boys Basketball team has won 4 Suffolk County AA championships (2008, 2010, 2011, and 2016) And won back to back Long Island Championships (2010 and 2011). The first time that has been accomplished in school history. In 2009, the Football team also won its first Long Island Championship in school history. The Boys Basketball team has made the class AA playoffs every year since 2006. Former Head Coach Bill Mitaritonna was named Newsday's HS Basketball Coach of the Year (2010). The Varsity Soccer team made the state semi-finals in 2007 and won the Long Island Championship in 2017. The Hills Swim team has gone undefeated and won league and county champs. The Varsity Football Team has made the playoffs the past 5 of 8 years and were the 2009 Long Island Champions and the 2018 Long Island Champions. In 2014, The Hills West Varsity Softball team won its first ever Suffolk County Championship with a 22-4 record. Hills West Dance team, the Wranglerettes, are the 2007 champions in the Long Island Kickline Association competition, winning in the jazz category for the 14th year, and in the newly created hip hop category. The official school mascot is the Colt. The school's colors are red and gold.\n\nWest Hollow Middle School, located at 250 Old East Neck Road in Melville, is the largest middle school in the district. Opened in 1970, the building's architects, Geo. B. Post and Sons, included unique features and upscale amenities that made the school a design showplace. These included an \"open-concept\" floor plan (originally, most classrooms had no doors, and hallways and rooms had wall-to-wall carpeting for sound absorption), a \"galleria-style\" atrium featuring tropical and exotic plant species (donated by Planting Fields Arboretum of Oyster Bay), a small interior greenhouse, a multi-purpose auditorium that could be divided into three sections (a main theater and two smaller lecture halls), and a central air-conditioning system (making it useful for hosting the district's summer school sessions). On the north side of building (where the annex wing was later built) were once three tennis courts. The current principal is Steven Hauk. The school's athletic teams are collectively known by the nickname \"Wolverines\", and the current school colors are a passionate red, white, black, purple, and occasionally blue. Approximately 1,900 students attend the school.\n\nCandlewood, located at 1200 Carll's Straight Path in Dix Hills, is the second middle school that underwent renovations in 2003. The current principal is Pamela Higgins. The mascot is the Cougar and the current school colors are red and gold. A track has been completed. Roughly 1,200 students attend the school.\n\nIn the district's history, there were as many as 11 operating elementary schools. The first to close was Sweet Hollow in the 1970s. In the early 1980s, Taukomas, The Hills School and Manasquan closed due to declining enrollment. Manasquan became the district's central office building (later renamed as Fran Greenspan Administration Center) and fed to Burr's Lane Junior High School (also closed, eventually becoming part of the Five Towns College campus in the early 1990s). Vanderbilt, Otsego, and Forest Park used to all feed to Candlewood, which feeds to High School West. Signal Hill, Chestnut Hill, Paumonok, and Sunquam used to all feed to West Hollow, which feeds to High School East. Sunquam re-opened in 1999 after being closed since 1991. It underwent extensive renovations and an expansion, and is located across the street from the Melville branch of Half Hollow Hills Community Library. Chestnut Hill and Forest Park closed in 2014 (eliminating one school from each high school's tracks). In November 2018, Half Hollow Hills Community Library - Dix Hills moved its operations into leased space at Chestnut Hill, temporarily relocating for a three-year term, while its main library building undergoes demolition and a complete rebuild.\n\nHalf Hollow Hills is known for its district-wide theater programs that extends to all schools in the district. This opportunity begins in 5th grade with the \"Hills On Stage\" program.\n\nBoth High School East and High School West are known for their research departments, which have produced a number of Intel Science Talent Search, Intel ISEF, and Siemens Westinghouse Competition finalists over the years.\n\nThe Fran Greenspan Administration Center (formerly known as the Manasquan building) houses the central offices of the Half Hollow Hills School District. It is located at 525 Half Hollow Road, directly adjacent to the southern end of the High School East campus. In addition to housing the offices of the Superintendent and other administrators, Central Office serves as the location for a small mock-astronautics program for children and certain community events, as well as child care services. Reach CYA is also housed in the Central Office Location.\n\n"}

An inscription on both faces of the arch reads, \"Liberty in N.America Triumphant MDCCLXXXIII\"; a tunnel known locally as the \"Dark Arch\", which was built to shield the inhabitants of the hall from traffic passing along Parlington Lane, still intact almost two hundred years later; an underground icehouse, also intact — a testament to Georgian brick construction. \n\nThe Parlington estate was acquired by the Gascoignes from the Wentworth family in 1546. The hall was modified by successive family members, before it was abandoned in the early years of the twentieth century it was a culmination of alterations by Sir Edward Gascoigne (early eighteenth century), his son Sir Thomas Gascoigne the last baronet (late eighteenth century), Richard Oliver-Gascoigne (early nineteenth century) and last by Isabella and her husband Frederick in the mid and late nineteenth century. The extent of the mansion by the turn of the twentieth century, its mixed architecture and myriad of materials presented an incoherent design, perhaps only improved by the highly regarded landscaped gardens, often cited in local newspaper articles. Sadly after it was abandoned the incremental demolition between the second decade of the twentieth century and the late nineteen fifties destroyed any ability to determine the age of the earliest parts of the property, most of that seen in any photographs is later than the seventeenth century. \n\nSir Thomas Gascoigne, 8th and last Baronet, succeeded his brother in 1762. Sir Thomas was M.P. for Thirsk from 1780 to 1784, for Malton in 1784 and for Arundel in 1795. He was also a keen breeder and trainer of horses and with Sir Thomas Stapleton won the St Leger Stakes in 1778 with Hollandoise and the same race twenty years later with his home-bred colt Symmetry. He supported the cause of American Independence and built a commemorative arch to the American Victory in the War of Independence, thought to be modelled on the Arch of Constantine in Rome, at the entrance to the estate.\n\nThe death in February 1810 of Sir Thomas Gascoigne the last baronet, aged 65 came just a few months after his heir and only child Tom had pre-deceased him as a result of an accident whilst hunting. Sir Thomas had a new will prepared and his step-daughter, Mary (second child of Sir Charles Turner and Mary Turner) benefitted with her husband Richard Oliver in a lifetime interest in the estates, a proviso being that the family took on the name of Gascoigne and that they had issue; thereafter Richard Oliver-Gascoigne, presided over the properties, Mary died in 1819, but by then they had four children, two sons and two daughters, both sons, pre-deceased Richard Oliver Gascoigne and the daughters Isabella and Elizabeth inherited all the estates in 1843. During his time at Parlington, Richard continued the racing interests of Sir Thomas, winning the St Leger in 1811 with Soothsayer and in 1824 with Jerry. He was responsible for building the \"Dark Arch\" in 1813 and was High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1816–17.\n\nIsabella and Elizabeth, two deeply creative women immediately commissioned the building of schools, almshouses and churches in the region and made huge improvements to their estates and to the living conditions of their tenantry. The sisters personally fabricated spectacular stained glass windows for their various projects. One of these survives in the park at Parlington. Isabella's particular interest was wood-turning and she installed at least three lathes in her own workshop at Parlington, as well as writing an authoritative book on the subject. In 1850, Isabella married Colonel Frederick Charles Trench of Woodlawn, County Galway, Ireland. In 1852, Elizabeth married Frederick's cousin Frederick Mason Trench, 2nd Baron Ashtown, head of the Trench family. Jointly the two sisters had already built the magnificent Castle Oliver on their father's estate in Limerick, Ireland. Elizabeth and her husband lived at Castle Oliver, while Isabella and her husband continued to reside at Parlington Hall until her death in 1891.\n\nFollowing the death of Isabella's husband in June 1905, Parlington Hall was abandoned. Their son Col. Frederick Richard Thomas Trench-Gascoigne was already established at another nearby family residence, Lotherton Hall to the east of Aberford, which he had inherited on the death of his Aunt Elizabeth. After 1905, much of the contents and smaller architectural features of Parlington were transferred to Lotherton and Parlington was largely demolished in the 1950s and 1960s, leaving only the west wing standing. Lotherton Hall, which lies on the road towards Towton, contains much Gascoigne memorabilia and is open to the public.\n\n"}

It consists of 161 volumes produced in 1857–1866 by J. P. Migne's Imprimerie Catholique, Paris. It includes both the Eastern Fathers and those Western authors who wrote before Latin became predominant in the Western Church in the 3rd century, e.g. the early writings collectively known as the Apostolic Fathers, such as the First and Second Epistle of Clement, the Shepherd of Hermas, Eusebius, Origen, and the Cappadocian Fathers Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa.\n\nThe 161 volumes are bound as 166 (vols. 16 and 87 being in three parts and vol. 86 in two). An important final volume, which included some supplements and a full index, was never published, as the plates were destroyed in a fire (1868) at the printer.\n\nThe first series contained only Latin translations of the originals (81 vols., 1856-61). The second series contains the Greek text with a Latin translation (166 vols., 1857-66). The texts are interlaced, with one column of Greek and a corresponding column on the other side of the page that is the Latin translation. Where the Greek original has been lost, as in the case of Irenaeus, the extant Greek fragments are interspersed throughout the Latin text. In one instance, the original is preserved in Syriac only and translated into Latin. Quite often, information about the author is provided, also in Latin.\n\nA Greek, D. Scholarios, added a half-published list of the authors and subjects, (Athens, 1879) and began a complete table of contents (Athens, 1883).

Founded by Greek refugees from Adrianople after the Treaty of Lausanne when the population exchange occurred between Turkey and Greece, in which the Evros River became the new border between the two countries. The population is around 20,000.\n\nAncient Orestiada was located in present-day Turkey, across the river from the current town of Kastanies. In ancient times, there was a small settlement on this site which legends claim was founded by Orestes, the son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra.\n\nIn 1920, after the liberation of Thrace, the city was renamed Orestiada and conferred on Greece along with the whole of Western Thrace and most of Eastern Thrace under the Treaty of Sevres. Following the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) and the Armistice of Mudanya (October 1922), the Western Forces surrendered Eastern Thrace to Turkey and the Greek army was ordered to withdraw within 15 days to positions east of Evros. As a result, Adrianople (renamed Edirne) which is located to the east of Evros, became Turkish, but Karagatch, located to the west of Evros, remained in Greece. As Eastern Thrace was evacuated by its Greek population, several residents of Edirne fled to its neighboring suburb, Karagatch, on the other bank of the river (the west and still Greek), hoping that something would change and they could go back to their homes more easily. However at the Lausanne conference, the British representative Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Curzon, with French Prime Minister Poincaré, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and United States High Commissioner Admiral Mark L. Bristol, failed to reach a compromise with Ismet Pasha, the chief negotiator for Turkey. Effects were made more difficult following protests by the Turks and hindered still further by Admiral Bristol's explicit support for Turkish efforts.\n\nAs compensation to the new Turkish republic, Greece was asked to pay 4 billion gold francs (half of the cost Greek military and commercial fleet), to leave the Ecumenical Patriarchate from Constantinople and hold a referendum in Western Thrace to decide its future. In reaction to Eleftherios Venizelos, in May 1923, the French general Mauritius Pelley argued: \"Since Greece cannot pay, the old Orestiada (Karagatch) should be given to the Turks.\" His proposal was accepted. Karagatch, with the villages of Bosna and Demerdes, were transferred to Turkish control, along with the strategic railhead and Karagatch railway station which at the time served Edirne also. The 17,000 Greek inhabitants of the Karagatch Triangle learned of this concession on 27 May 1923. The abandonment of the old Orestiada began in July 1923, as the population moved beyond the Evros River, the new border. At 10:20, 15 September 1923 around 1500 years of Greek orthodox history was at an end. On 4 June 1923, a committee, which had only been formed the day before at a joint meeting of the inhabitants of old Orestiada, traveled 17 kilometers south, to the uninhabited rural site of Kum-Tsiflik (Sandy Estate), to view the possible new settlement. On 12 August 1923, the new city called New Orestias and later New Orestiada was inaugurated to remind the old Orestiada, Karagatch. The inauguration of the new city took place in August 1923 by the Metropolitan of Adrianople Polycarpos, with Spyros Dassios also in attendance.\n\nOrestiada has a medical center, an orchestra, and a choir as well as a sugar factory, outside the city which processes locally grown sugar beets. Asparagus, potatoes, tobacco, watermelons, and corn are also grown. As well, a cattle breeding fund gives commercial impetus to the city and the whole area which is in such an economically strategic location in Europe.\n\nIt is also the site of the Fylakio detention center for illegal immigrants. In November 2010, the European Union sent Frontex forces to Orestiada to help Greek police patrol the local section of the border with Turkey. Some 31,400 people crossed just that portion of the border in the first nine months of 2010.\n\nOrestiada lies in the plain of the river Evros, at 40 metres above sea level. Orestiada is only 6 km west of the banks of the Evros, which forms a natural border between Greece and Turkey. Orestiada is located 17 km north of Didymoteicho, 19 km south of Edirne, 28 km southeast of the Greek-Turkish-Bulgarian tripoint, 40 km southeast of Svilengrad, 91 km northeast of Alexandroupoli, and 212 km west of Istanbul.\n\nThe city is served by two railway stations, the larger Orestiada railway station, and a smaller station Sakkos, both on the Alexandroupoli–Svilengrad line. Historically the city was on the İstanbul Sirkeci-Svilengrad line, since 1971 a parallel railway line that runs exclusively over Turkish territory so that the Orestiada station is now touched only by regional traffic.\n\nThe Greek National Road 51/E85 passes 1 km to the west of Orestiada.\n\nIn 1999, Orestiada became the fourth town to host university departments (faculties) of the Democritus University of Thrace. The faculties based in Orestiada are the Department of Agricultural Development and the Department of Forestry, Environmental Management and Natural Resources. Both faculties have a five-year curriculum. More than 800 students live in the city.\n\nOrestias hosts two sports club with presence in the higher national divisions, Orestis Orestiadas F.C. a football club and A.C. Orestias a volleyball club, playing in A1 Ethniki.\n\nThe municipality Orestiada was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\n\nThe municipality has an area of 955.591 km, the municipal unit 256.898 km.\n\nThe municipal unit Orestiada is subdivided into the following communities (constituent settlements in brackets):\n\nThe province of Orestiada () was one of the provinces of the Evros Prefecture. It had the same territory as the present municipality. It was abolished in 2006.\n\nThe population of the settlements within the municipal community of Orestiada at the 2011 census was:\n\n"}

First performed on 24 March 1820 in the Chiesa di San Ferdinando in Naples, it is in the traditional form of a \"Gloria\" mass, that is a setting of the first two prayers of the Catholic mass, the Kyrie and Gloria. (A \"Gloria\" mass omits the Credo, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei.) The \"Messa di Gloria\" was the only major piece of sacred music written while Rossini was still an active opera composer.\n\nThe \"Kyrie\" is divided into three portions, the first a dotted-rhythm \"Kyrie eleison\" for chorus in E-flat minor, the second, a more lyrical E-flat major \"Christe eleison\" for two tenors with the first minor-key section rounding out the prayer.\n\nThe \"Gloria\" portion takes up the vast majority of the work and is split up into operatic-style \"numbers\", soprano soloists alternating with tenors, basses, etc. The high point, emotionally, comes at the \"Qui tollis\", which begins with a slow portion for chorus and tenor, then concludes with a brilliant cabaletta (\"Qui sedes\"), showing off the extreme upper end of the tenor's range. Critics of the time were slightly scandalized by Rossini's morphing of sacred ceremony into opera seria, and even buffa, at times.\n\nIn his 1995 study of the \"Messa di Gloria\", Jesse Rosenberg agrees with contemporary reports that Rossini was helped in the composition of the concluding \"number\" of the \"Messa\", a four-part double fugue setting of \"Cum sancto spiritu\", by another Italian composer more versed in counterpoint, Pietro Raimondi.\n\n"}
{"id": "2207554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207554", "title": "John Breathitt", "text": "John Breathitt\n\nJohn Breathitt (September 9, 1786 – February 21, 1834) was the 11th Governor of Kentucky. He was the first Democrat to hold this office and was the second Kentucky governor to die in office. Shortly after his death, Breathitt County, Kentucky was organized and named in his honor.\n\nEarly in life, Breathitt was appointed a deputy surveyor in Illinois Territory. On his return to Kentucky, he taught at a country school. Through investments, he amassed enough wealth to live on while he studied law (\"read the law\") with Judge Caleb Wallace. In 1811, Breathitt was elected to the first of several terms in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 1828. Although his running mate William T. Barry lost the office of governor to Thomas Metcalfe, Breathitt defeated his opponent for lieutenant governor.\n\nDuring his term as lieutenant governor, Breathitt was one of several proposed candidates to succeed John Rowan in the United States Senate. The General Assembly deadlocked over the appointment and the seat went unfilled until the Assembly's next term. In the next gubernatorial election in 1832, Breathitt was nominated by the Democrats for governor. Breathitt won, but James Turner Morehead, the Whig candidate for lieutenant governor, defeated Breathitt's running mate. Initially, Breathitt enjoyed popularity for his public condemnation of John C. Calhoun's doctrine of nullification, but he struggled in state politics because the Whigs controlled the legislature. He died in office of tuberculosis on February 21, 1834.\n\nJohn Breathitt was born near New London, Henry County, Virginia on September 9, 1786. He was the eldest of five sons and four daughters born to William and Elizabeth (Whitsett) Breathitt. William Breathitt had immigrated to Maryland from Scotland, then settled in Virginia. Elizabeth was of English ancestry. \n\nTwo younger brothers later also became active in politics: George Breathitt served as a private secretary to President Andrew Jackson. James Breathitt became Commonwealth's Attorney for the state of Kentucky. \n\nTheir sister Jane Breathitt married Dr. John Sappington from Nashville, Tennessee, and the couple moved to central Missouri territory in 1817. There Sappington developed businesses, and then acquired land and slaves, becoming politically influential in Saline County. But he became nationally known for his development of a patent medicine: quinine pills to treat malaria and other fevers, which were widespread in the Missouri and Mississippi valleys. He manufactured and sold the pills, which became national bestsellers. Two of the Sappington sons-in-law became governors of Missouri, as did one of his and Jane's grandsons. \n\nBreathitt was educated at home and in the few public schools of his native state. His family moved to Logan County, Kentucky in 1800, where he continued his education. In early adulthood, he was appointed as a deputy surveyor in Illinois Territory. He returned to Kentucky, where he taught in a country school. He invested his income in land purchases, and shortly amassed enough wealth to sustain him for a few years. He studied or read law under Judge Caleb Wallace. He was admitted to the bar of Russellville, Kentucky in 1810 and opened his practice there.\n\nIn 1812, Breathitt married Caroline Whitaker of Logan County. The couple had a son and a daughter together. After Caroline died, Breathitt married Susan M. Harris of Chesterfield County, Virginia. Breathitt had another daughter by his second wife. Although Breathitt died at age 47, he had survived both of his wives.\n\nBreathitt was elected to represent Logan County in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1811, and was re-elected every year until 1815. In the gubernatorial election of 1828, the Democrats chose William T. Barry as their candidate for governor. Initially, they offered the nomination for lieutenant governor to Judge John P. Oldham, but Oldham declined, and Breathitt was chosen as his replacement. Barry lost the governorship to National Republican Thomas Metcalfe, but Breathitt defeated Metcalfe's running mate Joseph R. Underwood by more than 1,000 votes.\n\nAs lieutenant governor, Breathitt promoted the creation of public schools in the state. On December 31, 1829, he was elected president of the Kentucky Educational Society, whose stated mission was to \"promote improvement and diffusion of popular education by the circulation of information, by enlisting the pulpit and the press, by procuring the delivery of popular addresses on the subject on the 4th day of July, and in different neighborhoods, and by other means that may be found practicable.\"In 1833, Breathitt became president of the Kentucky Common School Society.\n\nIn 1831, Breathitt was one of several candidates put before the General Assembly to succeed John Rowan in the United States Senate. He received 66 of 137 votes, 3 votes short of a majority. Other unsuccessful nominees included John J. Crittenden (68 votes), Richard Mentor Johnson (64 votes), and Charles A. Wickliffe (49 votes). After 15 ballots, the Assembly was unable to select a nominee, and postponed the matter until the next session. At that session, the Assembly chose Henry Clayto fill the seat.\n\nIn 1832, the Democrats selected Breathitt and Benjamin Taylor as their candidates for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. They faced a Whig (formerly National Republican) ticket of Richard Aylett Buckner and James Turner Morehead. Buckner was hurt by his highly religious ideals, including opposition to handling mail on Sunday, and failed to garner the support of some of his own party's newspapers. Breathitt defeated Buckner by a small margin, but Morehead defeated Taylor, Breathitt's little-known running mate. \n\nBreathitt's election marked the first time a Democrat was elected to the governorship of Kentucky. The election was marred by fraud, however. In Oldham County, the number of votes tallied represented 162.9% of the eligible voters in the county, and these votes were recorded as two-to-one in favor of Breathitt. Most Kentuckians were more concerned about the upcoming presidential election, hoping Whig and native son Henry Clay would defeat Democrat Andrew Jackson. Because of this leaning, voters elected Whig candidates for most of the other state offices. \n\nEarly in his term, Breathitt won favor from both Whigs and Democrats by opposing South Carolina's actions during the Nullification Crisis. Following Breathitt's lead, the state legislature passed resolutions condemning the doctrine of nullification on February 2, 1833. This action was particularly significant because John C. Calhoun's justification for nullification was largely based on the 1799 Kentucky Resolutions.\n\nBreathitt did not fare as well in state politics. He ardently supported Jacksonian principles, and wielded his veto against bills critical of President Jackson's land policy. He supported Jackson's desire to dissolve the Second Bank of the United States. Instead, he favored opening a number of state banks but, faced with a Whig majority in the legislature, he succeeded only in chartering the Louisville Bank of Kentucky. He also favored completion of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad to improve infrastructure and access to markets. He supported a $300,000 loan from the state Board of Internal Improvements for that purpose. In 1833, a loan for half the amount was approved, resulting in the railroad not being completed until 1851. \n\nBreathitt was part of the temperance movement in Kentucky. In an 1832 address, he blamed consumption of alcohol for the high murder rate in the state. When the Kentucky Legislative Temperance Society was formed at a meeting in the state house on January 13, 1834, Breathitt was chosen as its president and Lieutenant Governor Morehead served as one of five vice-presidents.\n\nBreathitt died in office of tuberculosis in the governor's mansion in Frankfort on February 21, 1834. He was the second sitting governor of Kentucky to die in office. Originally buried in the Breathitt family cemetery, he was later re-interred at Maple Grove Cemetery in Russellville. Breathitt County, Kentucky was formed in 1839 and named in his honor. On March 5, 1872, the Kentucky General Assembly resolved to erect a monument over Breathitt's grave in Russellville.\n\n\n"}

Brady, 316 U.S. 455 (1942), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case that denied counsel to indigent defendants when prosecuted by a state. It was famously overruled by \"Gideon v. Wainwright\".\n\nIn its decision in \"Johnson v. Zerbst\", the Supreme Court had held that defendants in federal courts had a right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. In \"Powell v. Alabama\", the Court had held that state defendants in capital cases were entitled to counsel, even when they could not afford it; however, the right to an attorney in trials in the states was not yet obligatory in all cases as it was in federal courts under \"Johnson v. Zerbst\". In \"Betts v. Brady\", Betts was indicted for robbery and upon his request for counsel, the trial judge refused, forcing Betts to represent himself. He was convicted of robbery, a conviction he eventually appealed to the Supreme Court on the basis that he was being held unlawfully because he had been denied counsel.\n\nHe filed writ of habeas corpus at the Circuit Court for Washington County, Maryland claiming he had been denied counsel and then filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Maryland (the Maryland ultimate appellate court). His petitions were all denied and he finally filed for certiorari to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the Court found that Betts did not have the right to be appointed counsel with Justice Hugo Black emphatically dissenting. In the majority opinion, Justice Owen Roberts said for the Court,\n\nIn this selection from the majority opinion and throughout the rest of the opinion, Roberts continually makes the point that not all defendants in all cases will need the assistance of counsel in order to receive a fair trial with due process. Roberts appears to be of the opinion that, while counsel may be necessary to receive a fair trial in some cases, it is not in all cases. However, in his dissent, Black wrote,\n\nBlack said in his dissent that the denial of counsel based on financial stability makes it so that those in poverty have an increased chance of conviction, which is not equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. During his dissent, Black cited also \"Johnson v. Zerbst\", making the point that had the proceedings of Betts's case been held in federal court, his petition for counsel to be appointed to him would have been accepted and counsel would have been appointed. Black argued that because this right was guaranteed in federal courts, the Fourteenth Amendment should make the right obligatory upon the states; however, the majority disagreed. Black argued also that a man of even average intelligence could not possibly be expected to represent himself without any training in such matters as the law.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2207599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207599", "title": "Continuum Fingerboard", "text": "Continuum Fingerboard\n\nThe Continuum Fingerboard or Haken Continuum is a music performance controller and synthesizer developed by Lippold Haken, a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, and sold by Haken Audio, located in Champaign, Illinois.\n\nThe Continuum Fingerboard was initially developed from 1983 to 1998 at the CERL Sound Group at the University of Illinois, to control sound-producing algorithms on the Platypus audio signal processor and the Kyma/Capybara workstation.\n\nIn 1999, the first Continuum Fingerboard was commercially sold. Until 2008, the Continuum Fingerboard provided IEEE-1394 (FireWire) connections to control a Kyma sound design workstation, as well as MIDI connections to control a MIDI synthesizer module. More recently, the Continuum Fingerboard generates audio directly in addition to providing MIDI connections for MIDI modules, software synthesizers, and Kyma (the IEEE-1394 connection that was present on earlier models has been removed). An external control voltage generator permits control of analog modular synthesizers.\n\nThe Continuum features a touch-sensitive neoprene playing surface measuring approximately high by either long for a full-size instrument, or long for a half-size instrument. The surface allows a pitch range of 9350 cents (about 7.79 octaves) for the full-size instrument, and 4610 cents (about 3.84 octaves) for the half-size instrument. The instrument has a response time of 0.33 ms.\nSensors under the playing surface respond to finger position and pressure in three dimensions and provide pitch resolution of one-tenth cent along the length of the scale (the X dimension), allowing essentially continuous pitch control for portamento effects and notes that are not in the chromatic scale, and allowing for the application of vibrato or pitch bend to a note. A software \"rounding\" feature enables pitch to be quantized to the notes of a traditional equal-tempered scale, just scale or other scale to facilitate in-tune performance, with the amount and duration of the \"rounding\" controllable in real time.\n\nThe Continuum also provides two additional parameters for the sound: it is able to transmit the finger pressure on the board as a MIDI value, as well as the finger's vertical position on the key. These parameters are independently programmable; a standard configuration is where position on the X-Axis (lengthwise) on the instrument corresponds to pitch, position on the Y-Axis (widthwise) corresponds to a timbre shift, and position on the Z-Axis (vertically) corresponds to a change in amplitude. The Continuum is capable of polyphonic performance, with up to 16 simultaneous voices.\n\nEach recent revision has brought more features and sound diversity to the internal synthesizer in the Continuum Fingerboard. As such, the instrument is starting to be both a controller and a stand-alone instrument.\n\nAs of 2008, the Continuum Fingerboard has a new modular digital synthesizer built-in, specifically designed for the Continuum Fingerboard, called The EaganMatrix. The EaganMatrix uses a patching matrix to design synthesis algorithms. The patching matrix interconnects a variety of modules: oscillator, filter, delay, modulation, waveshaping, spectral manipulation, modal physical modeling, waveguide physical modeling, kinetic modeling, granulation, and shape generator. Each three-dimensional performance direction of the Continuum playing surface can influence each patch point in the matrix. By defining formulas and placing them at points in the patching matrix, the user creates relationships between the finger touching the Continuum playing surface and the flow of sound from patch sources to patch destinations. The EaganMatrix is named after the Canadian composer Edmund Eagan.\n\nA major proponent of the Continuum in contemporary music is Jordan Rudess, keyboardist of the progressive metal band Dream Theater. Each Dream Theater studio album from \"Octavarium\" (2005) to \"A Dramatic Turn of Events\" (2011) features the Continuum in at least one song. It was fixture of Rudess' live setup from 2005 to 2014, as seen on the concert DVD releases \"Score\", \"Chaos in Motion 2007-2008\", \"Live at Luna Park\", and \"Breaking the Fourth Wall\". It was also used on Rudess' 2007 solo album \"The Road Home\".\n\nAnother advocate is Sarth Calhoun, who uses it in his work with Lucibel Crater and whilst he was working with Lou Reed. In the Metal Machine Trio both Calhoun and Reed used Continuum Fingerboards on stage.\n\nIndian composer A.R. Rahman's 2007 Third Dimension tour of North America featured the Continuum. He used the Continuum in a piece he composed for the Changing Notes Concert held in Chennai, and in the song \"Rehna Tu\" in the 2009 movie \"Delhi-6\" and the new version of \"Mile Sur Mera Tumhara\". He also used it in his score of the film \"Kadal\" and in the track \"Acid Darbari\" from the Academy Award-nominated soundtrack of \"127 Hours\". Rahman was particularly impressed with the fact that the Continuum fingerboard could produce Carnatic/Hindustani classical music notes, which is a significant improvement over the piano. In August 2013, Rahman was seen using the Continuum in his song \"Soz O Salam\" in Coke Studio @ MTV (India) Season 3.\n\nThe Continuum was used by John Williams for his score to \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\".\n\nComposer and performer Derek Duke used the Continuum in Blizzard Entertainment game soundtracks, including \"\", \"World of Warcraft\", and \"Diablo III\".\n\nThe Turkish-American composer and performer Mehmet Ali Sanlıkol used the Continuum in two albums, Whatsnext? (2014) and Resolution (2016), that combine Turkish musical traditions with jazz. \nComposer and performer Ramin Djawadi both conducts the orchestra and plays Continuum in his 'Game of Thrones Live Concert Experience' tour, with the Full-size Continuum Fingerboard at his conductor's podium.\n\nComposer and performer Matthias Weber used the Continuum in his score for Das Boot (TV series) (2018). His Continuum solo in the opening of the first episode \"conveys a sense of loneliness\" and \"a sense of vast space that the ocean is – similar to outer space.\" Throughout the series he used it \"melodically, both for aggressive, distorted colors for the U Boat; and for softer flute-like timbres\" and for \"musical sound design textures for tension and suspense.\"\n\nOther musicians using the Continuum include John Paul Jones, Lou Reed, Randy Kerber and Amon Tobin.\n\n\n"}

It was created on 8 June 1635 for John Gascoigne. He had converted to Roman Catholicism in 1604. His son Sir Thomas, 2nd Baronet, was accused of conspiracy to murder King Charles II as part of the mythical Popish Plot, but acquitted. The eighth Baronet was Member of Parliament for Thirsk, Malton and Arundel. He renounced Catholicism, and was much involved in the Irish Parliament and in horse racing. Sir Thomas died in 1810, the year after his only son died in a hunting accident, upon which the baronetcy became either extinct or dormant.\n\nThe surname Gascoigne derives from Gascony in France. The best-known family of this name believed to have come to England at the time of the Norman Conquest , settled in Yorkshire, although this is not proven. The Gascoignes were established by the thirteenth century at Gawthorpe and Harewood; these estates passed in 1567 to the Wentworth family by the marriage of the Gascoigne heiress. The junior branch acquired estates at Lasingcroft in 1392 and moved in the 16th century firstly to Barnbow near Leeds and then to Parlington Hall, Parlington, situated west of Aberford, near Leeds, acquired from the Wentworths in 1546.\n\nSir Thomas Gascoigne, 8th and last Baronet, succeeded his brother in 1762. He left his property, including Parlington Hall, to his stepdaughter on the condition that her husband, Richard Oliver of Castle Oliver in County Limerick, change his name to Richard Oliver Gascoigne (see Oliver Gascoigne). In 1825, Richard acquired Lotherton Hall from a fellow turf enthusiast. In 1843 the estates were inherited by Richard Oliver Gascoigne's two daughters, Mary Isabella and Elizabeth, who took one estate each on their marriages.\n\nMary Isabella and her husband Frederick Charles Trench, who took the surname Trench Gascoigne, lived at Parlington, while Lotherton became the property of Elizabeth Gascoigne, who married Frederick Charles' cousin Frederic Mason Trench, 2nd Baron Ashtown. The Ashtowns lived mostly in Ireland, on the estates of the Trench family and at Castle Oliver, and when in 1893 Elizabeth died, leaving no children of her own, Lotherton passed to her nephew Colonel Frederick Richard Thomas Trench-Gascoigne, (4 July 1851 – 2 June 1937), from the Royal Horse Guards and a DSO in 1900, a well-known soldier and traveler of the day.\n\nColonel Gascoigne further inherited Parlington in 1905, but preferred Lotherton. The furnishings and some structural items from Parlington Hall were transferred to Lotherton, after which Parlington was allowed to decay until, apart from the west wing, still standing, it was demolished in a number of stages from around 1911 to 1968. The most prominent artefact removed to Lotherton Hall was the Thomas Banks bas-relief marble of the classic scene Alcyone and Ceyx.\n\nThe Gascoignes continued at Lotherton Hall until the death of Sir Alvary Gascoigne, a.k.a. Sir Alvary Douglas Frederick Trench-Gascoigne, (6 August 1893 – 18 April 1970), formerly a British Ambassador to Japan, 1946 – 1951, or rather a Political advisor to Japan, 1946–1951, British Ambassador to Russia, 1951 – 1953, a CMG in 1942, in 1948, GBE in 1953, whose son, Captain Douglas Wilder Trench-Gascoigne, (11 November 1917 – August 1944) had predeceased him while fighting in WWII, in August 1944.\n\nThe property was presented to the City of Leeds for the public benefit and is now open to the public.\n\nThe \"Gascoigne\" pub, in Garforth, is named after the Parlington family and also Colonel Gascoigne a local Colliery owner.

He was a member of Indian National Congress. He belonged to Haryana and was a minister in the undivided Punjab and then Haryana government. His 100th birth anniversary celebration was inaugurated by President Pranab Mukherjee on 27 November 2014.\n\nBorn into a mercantile family on 26 November 1914, in Sanghi, a small village in Rohtak district of Undivided Punjab (now Haryana), Ranbir Singh Hooda got his initial education at his village school and later at the Gurukul Bhainswal Kalan near Gohana ( Sonipat ) run by the Arya Samaj activist and social reformer, Bhagat Phool Singh?\n\nAfter completing primary education, Ranbir Singh Hooda joined Vaish High School, Rohtak. He completed matriculation in 1933 and joined Government College, Rohtak for higher studies. He passed his FA examination in 1935. Later, he moved to Delhi and graduated from Ramjas College in 1937. He was conferred with an honorary degree of D.Litt. by Kurukshetra University in 2007. \n\nRanbir Singh Hooda joined the Gandhian army in 1930s to contribute towards India's freedom struggle. He was first arrested in 1941 for participating in a Satyagraha movement. He was put behind the bars several times during India's freedom struggle. In all, he spent three and a half years in rigorous imprisonment and was under house arrest for two years. He was imprisoned in different jails in Rohtak, Ambala, Hisar, Ferozepur, Lahore (Borstal), Lahore (Central), Multan and Sialkot. He remained closely associated with Mahatma Gandhi during the latter's visits to Rohtak and nearby districts of Punjab. \n\nThe Indian National Congress party sent him to the Constituent Assembly in July 1947, largely owing to his contribution to the freedom movement. He was instrumental in the framing of the Indian Constitution and primarily voiced concerns of workers and peasants. He was also a member of the Provisional Parliament and served it in 1950–52. He contested the first general election in 1952 from the Rohtak Lok Sabha constituency and won the poll with a huge margin. In the second general elections in 1957, he again successfully contested from his old constituency of Rohtak. In 1962, he was elected to the Punjab assembly. He was inducted into the council of ministers and held the portfolios of Power and Irrigation in 1962–66 and PWD and Health in 1966–67. He is also remembered for his contribution in the creation of the Bhakra Nangal Power Project.\n\nUpon the formation of Haryana as a new state on 1 November 1966, he shifted his political base to Haryana and became a minister. He won the Kiloi assembly seat in a by-election in 1968. He was elected to Rajya Sabha in 1972 and worked for the introduction of pension for former MPs. He remained the deputy leader of the Congress in Rajya Sabha in 1976–77. Ranbir Singh Hooda was the founder general secretary of Bharat Krishak Samaj and the All-India Backward Classes Federation. He remained the working president of the All-India Freedom Fighters Organisation till his demise.\n\nRanbir Singh Hooda had set a record for being a member of seven different houses in India's democratic history, a feat that has been registered and acknowledged by the Limca Book of Records. \n\nOn 1 February 2011, Indian National Congress President Sonia Gandhi released a postage stamp depicting him.\n\nRanbir Singh Hooda died at the age of 94 on 1 February 2009. He was few of the surviving members of the Constituent Assembly of India during his death. He is survived by his sons Bhupinder Singh, Inder Singh and Dharmender Singh.

Law libraries are also used by people who draft or advocate for new laws, e.g. legislators and others who work in state government, local government, and legislative counsel offices or the U.S. Office of Law Revision Counsel and lobbying professionals. Self-represented, or pro se, litigants (parties to a civil lawsuit or criminal defendants who do not have a licensed attorney representing them) also use law libraries.\n\nA law library may contain print, computer assisted legal research, and microform collections of laws in force, session laws, superseded laws, foreign and international law, and other research resources, e.g. continuing legal education resources and legal encyclopedias (e.g. Corpus Juris Secundum among others), legal treatises, and legal history. A law library may also have law librarians who help legal researchers navigate law library collections and who teach legal research. Some law libraries serve scholars from around the world, e.g. Institute of Advanced Legal Studies in London and the New York City Bar Association Law Library.\n\nLaw libraries in the United States are usually classified as a type of special library because of their focus on providing specialized resources, as well as their specialized and limited user base.\n\nMost law schools around the world have a law library, or in some universities, at least a section of the university library devoted to law. In the United States, law school libraries may be subject to accreditation review by the American Bar Association Standards of Legal Education.\n\nLaw libraries may be found in courts, legislatures (e.g. the Law Library of Congress), prison libraries, government departments, private law firms, and barristers chambers.\n\nOutside of the United States, the largest and most extensive law libraries are those found in countries that follow the English common law which spread throughout the world with the expansion of the British Empire. These countries include but are not limited to Australia, Canada, India, and New Zealand. Law libraries in these countries can be found in law schools, courts, government, private law firms, and barristers chambers.\n\nThe largest law library in the United Kingdom is the Bodleian Law Library with a collection of over 550,000 volumes. Outside of England, the largest law library in the Commonwealth of Nations is Osgoode Hall Law School's at York University in Canada, with more than 500,000 print volumes. The earliest common law law libraries were founded in the late 15th century in London and include Gray's Inn and Lincoln's Inn.\n\nSpecial collections of legal literature in university and research libraries in England include the Viner collection at the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford (the personal library of Charles Viner, bequeathed to the Radcliffe Library in 1756); a collection of English legal manuscripts at Cambridge University Library; the Smuts collection on Commonwealth law, the Maitland collection on legal history, and the Clark, Roby and Buckland collections relating to Roman law, all in the Squire Law Library, a department of the Cambridge University Library; and the Slade-Baker collection of correspondence accumulated by the Slade-Baker firm of solicitors in Bewdley which is in Birmingham University Library.\n\nThe largest law libraries in the world are found in the United States. The world's largest law library is the Law Library of Congress, which holds over 2.9 million volumes. The world's largest academic law library is the library of Harvard Law School, which holds over 2 million volumes. By way of contrast, the largest law library in the United Kingdom is the Bodleian Law Library with a collection of over 550,000 volumes.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are three categories of law libraries in the United States. Every law school accredited by the American Bar Association houses a law library. Public law libraries are available in many states, often in the local courthouses. Some larger law firms maintain a private library for their own attorneys, but many firms in college towns and larger cities with universities simply dispatch their attorneys to local law schools to do legal research.\n\nA typical law library holds a large number of works not seen in other libraries, including a full set of \"United States Reports\", one or both of the unofficial U.S. Supreme Court reporters, the West National Reporter System, the West American Digest System, official reporters from various states, the \"Federal Register\", volumes of \"American Jurisprudence\", bound volumes containing issues of prominent law reviews from around the country, federal and state statutes and regulations (such as the United States Code and Code of Federal Regulations), and a variety of treatises, encyclopedias, looseleaf services, and practice guides.\n\nLarge law libraries may contain many additional materials covering topics such as: legal education, research, and writing; the history of the American legal system and profession; the history behind certain high-profile cases; techniques of oral argument; and the legislative history of important federal and state statutes.\n\nSmaller law libraries usually hold, at a minimum, one unofficial Supreme Court reporter, selected West national reporters and digests specific to the state in which the library is located, the United States Code, a few state-specific reporters and statutory compilations (if they exist for a particular state), and several state-specific treatises and practice guides. Most academic law library websites also contain legal research guidelines on numerous legal topics that are available to the public.\n\nIn recent years, the advent of online legal research outlets such as FindLaw, Westlaw, LexisNexis, Bloomberg Law, and HeinOnline (or in Canada, CanLII) has reduced the need for some types of printed volumes like reporters and statutory compilations. A number of law libraries have therefore reduced the availability of printed works that can easily be found on the Internet, and have increased their own Internet availability. On the other hand, some university law libraries retain extensive historical collections going back to the earliest English reports. Many law libraries also participate in the Federal Depository Library Program which provides access to government information and documents to the public at no cost. This is particularly true of law school libraries as the library at any accredited law school is automatically eligible to become a depository library under the Program.\n\nMost law libraries are members of the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL). As of 2010, the association has over 5,000 member libraries. Another important association for law libraries is the Special Libraries Association.\n\nEvery accredited American law school is required by the American Bar Association to have a law library meeting certain minimum specifications with respect to quantity and quality of materials available. Some law school libraries are kept in the same building as the general library, but many are either in the law school's building, or in a separate facility altogether.\n\nAs of 2015, the American Bar Association has propounded rules requiring each law school's law library to include among its holdings the following \"core collection\":\n\nThe ABA also requires a library's collection to meet the academic needs of the students and research and teaching needs of the faculty.\n\nThe ABA further sets forth additional requirements, including the requirement that the law library have a full-time director who holds a law degree and a degree in library or information science or equivalent with extensive experience in librarianship. The ABA also requires that the library have sufficient staff and facilities to attend to the needs of the institution.\n\nMany academic law librarians participate in the AALL and specifically the Academic Law Libraries special interest section.\n\nPublic law libraries in the United States exist in many states and in federal jurisdictions, such as federal agencies; many courthouses also have a law library. Public law libraries are publicly funded but may or may not be open to the public.\n\nU.S. federal agencies have libraries and librarians who serve the legal research and other research needs of their employees and contractors, but these libraries are not open to the general public without an appointment. The Law Librarians' Society of Washington D.C. has a Special Interest Section, Federal Law Librarians. Some state and federal agencies maintain law libraries focusing on their regulatory areas. One prominent example is the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which runs a National Library Network providing access to specialized material to agency researchers and the general public.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court Building houses one of the most extensive federal public law libraries in the world, rivaled by the Law Library of Congress. Strictly speaking, neither the U.S. Supreme Court Library nor the Law Library of Congress is a public access law library; both, however, are government libraries funded by taxpayers, and accountable to the U.S. Supreme Court or to the U.S. Congress respectively. The Law Library of Congress does serve the public through various means, e.g. websites, social media services, and a physically accessible library.\n\nNew York and California are examples of states that have statutes requiring all their counties to maintain a public law library. While New York public access law libraries have remained relatively small, the LA Law Library in Los Angeles County is currently second in size behind the Law Library of Congress among U.S. public law libraries, with a collection at just under 1 million volumes, not including digital resources. Public law libraries are available, and in some cases are required, to offer law library and legal research services to the legal community consisting of legislators and other public officials, judges, and lawyers and to the general public, students, and to self-represented litigants. These public law libraries may be affiliated state or local courts. Some academic law libraries provide public access as well, especially in public universities.\n\nMany public law librarians are members of the American Association of Law Libraries professional association, and specifically in the Government Law Libraries special interest section.\n\nPublic law librarians who have written books about providing legal research services to the public and managing public law libraries include Anthony Aycock, Roy Balleste, Joel Fishman, Paul D. Healey, Ellyssa Kroski, Laurie Selwyn, and Virginia Tucker.\n\nSome law firms and corporate legal departments maintain in-house libraries, the size and content of which vary depending on the practice area and needs of the organization. These libraries would rarely, if ever, be available to individuals outside the organization, although in some locales law firm librarians have informal lending agreements between firms. Private law libraries often participate in the AALL's Private Law Librarians & Information Professionals Special Interest Section.\n\n"}

It is known as Goodsprings Road, connecting the town of Goodsprings to Interstate 15 at Jean. The route was part of State Route 53 prior to 1976.\n\nThe route begins at the intersection of Esmeralda Street and Spring Street in Goodsprings. It runs east along Spring Street, then exits the town and heads southeastward, intersecting Sandy Valley Road in the Mojave Desert. The road continues southeastward for about before entering Jean. SR 161 ends in Jean at an interchange with Interstate 15.\n\nA connection between Goodsprings and U.S. Route 91 (and SR 6) at Jean first appeared on official Nevada state maps in 1933. At that time, it was an unimproved county road. By 1935, that road was incorporated into State Route 53, which connected Jean to Goodsprings before curving southwest towards the California state line. By 1941, the first of the SR 53 reaching Goodsprings was paved, with the remaining in to Sandy Valley and on to California remained unimproved.\nSR 53 remained unchanged until the 1976 renumbering of Nevada's state highway system that was authorized on July 1, 1976. In that process, the paved portion of the highway between Jean and Goodsprings was renumbered to State Route 161. This change was first seen on the 1978–1979 edition of the official state map The remaining section of SR 53 to Sandy Valley continued to be shown on the state map, but was dropped from the state system by 1982. Sandy Valley is now reachable via the Sandy Valley road turnoff from SR 161, prior to entering Goodsprings.\n"}

After the ship was taken into custody by the United States Revenue Cutter Service, Cinqué and his fellow Africans were eventually tried for mutiny and killing officers on the ship, in a case known as \"United States v. The Amistad\". This reached the U.S. Supreme Court, where Cinqué and his fellow Africans were found to have rightfully defended themselves from being enslaved through the illegal Atlantic slave trade and were released. Americans helped raise money for the return of 35 of the survivors to Sierra Leone.\n\nCinqué was born c. 1814 in what is now Sierra Leone. His exact date of birth remains unknown. He was a rice farmer, and married with three children, when he was captured illegally by African slave traders in 1839 and sold to Pedro Blanco, a Spanish slave trader. He was imprisoned on the Portuguese slave ship \"Tecora\", in violation of treaties prohibiting the international slave trade. Cinqué was taken to Havana, Cuba, where he was sold with 110 others to Spaniards José Ruiz and Pedro Montez.\n\nThe Spaniards arranged to transport the captives on the coastal schooner \"Amistad\", with the intention of selling them as slaves at ports along the coast in Cuba for work at sugar plantations. On June 30, Cinqué led a revolt, killing the captain and the cook of the ship; two slaves also died, and two sailors escaped. The Africans took Ruiz and Montez as prisoners, the merchants who had purchased them, and demanded that they direct the ship back to Sierra Leone. Instead, at night, they directed the navigator in the opposite direction, toward the Americas, in the hope of attracting the attention of one of their fellow Spaniards who would save their ship and regain control. The ship had an uneven course between the coasts of the United States and Africa. After about two months, \"Amistad\" reached United States waters near Long Island, New York. Members of the USS \"Washington\" boarded the vessel. When they discovered what had happened (according to the Spaniards), they charged the Africans with mutiny and murder. The ship and the Mende were taken to New Haven, Connecticut to await trial.\n\nThe two Spaniards claimed that the Africans had been born in Cuba and were already slaves at the time of their purchase, and were therefore legal property. Interpreters from Mende to English were found, who enabled the Africans to tell their story to attorneys and the court. Cinqué served as the group's informal representative.\n\nAfter the case was ruled in favor of the Africans in the district and circuit courts, the case was appealed by the Spanish parties, including its government, to the Supreme Court of the United States. In March 1841, the Supreme Court ruled that the Africans mutinied to regain their freedom after being kidnapped and sold illegally. The advocacy of former U.S. President John Quincy Adams, together with Roger Sherman Baldwin, was critical to the Africans' defense. The court ordered the Africans freed and returned to Africa, if they wished. This decision was against the protests of President Martin Van Buren, who worried about relations with Spain and implications for domestic slavery.\n\nCinqué and the other Mende reached their homeland in 1842. In Sierra Leone, Cinqué encountered civil war. He and his company maintained contact with the local mission for a while, but Cinqué left to trade along the coast. Little is known of his later life, and rumors circulated. Some maintained that he had moved to Jamaica. Others held that he had become a merchant or a chief, perhaps trading in slaves himself. \n\nThe latter charge derived from oral accounts from Africa cited by the twentieth-century author William A. Owens, who claimed that he had seen letters from AMA missionaries suggesting Cinqué was a slave trader. More recently historians such as Howard Jones in 2000 and Joseph Yannielli in 2009 have argued that, although some of the Africans associated with the Amistad probably did engage in the slave trade upon their return, given the nature of the regional economy at the time, the allegations of Cinqué's involvement seem implausible in view of the lack of evidence, and the unlikelihood of a conspiracy of silence leaving no traces.\n\n\n\n"}

It stars Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron.\n\nSpencer Armacost (Johnny Depp) is an astronaut working for NASA, and his wife Jillian (Charlize Theron) is a second-grade elementary school teacher. While he and Alex Streck (Nick Cassavetes) are walking in space on a mission there is an explosion that knocks out their communication with the command center.\n\nThey land but when their spouses arrive to see them they are in the hospital; both asleep until they recover. Armacost eventually wakes up without problems, but Streck has a medical emergency requiring him to have an electrical cardioversion. Neither speak about the in-flight emergency. Armacost accepts a position with a New York-based company, McClaren. At a farewell party, Streck's aggressive behavior catches Jillian's attention before he suddenly dies from what NASA attributes to a stroke. At the Streck house Natalie Streck (Donna Murphy) electrocutes herself in the bath with a radio. \n\nIn New York at a party, Jillian asks Spencer to tell her about the space walk incident. He answers while he starts to make love to her. At home he makes aggressive love to her. She finds out she is pregnant, and at an ultrasound discovers she is having twins. She tells the doctor that earlier in her life, after her parents died, she sought psychiatric care because she started to see her loved ones dead, including herself. \n\nSherman Reese (Joe Morton) has been terminated from NASA because he continued to insist that something was wrong with Spencer, though all tests came back normal. Reese confronts Jillian to warn her, and she leaves in fear, wanting to believe he is crazy but knowing he is right about Spencer being different. Jillian calls Reese and he tells her that Natalie was pregnant with twins at the time of her suicide. Jillian asks what the autopsy showed about the twins and Reese tells Jillian that he needs to meet her in person to show her. Spencer intercepts him, and he goes missing. As a backup plan, he has sent her a key to a self storage locker that has a VHS video cassette that explains that there was a signal in space near Spencer and Streck when they lost contact with NASA. He believes the signal was an alien that wanted to get to Earth and traveled as a sound wave through space, taking over Spencer's body. He believes it will use her twins to pilot the McClaren plane that it is designing that disables warfare machinery. Jillian attempts a medical abortion but is thwarted by Spencer who slaps her. She throws herself down a flight of stairs and wakes up in the hospital. Spencer tells her that the twins survived the fall and intimidates her to keep her mouth shut about what happened.\n\nIn a dream, Jillian sees her sister, Nan (Clea DuVall), killed by Spencer when she questions why he has Reese's briefcase. Jillian leaves the hospital on her own but Spencer follows her because of his connection with the twins inside her. At home, Jillian barricades the door and goes into the room where she dreamed her sister was killed. She sees her body on the floor, but then it is gone, presumably a vision. When Spencer breaks his way into the apartment, she has flooded the kitchen floor with water, with a radio in the sink and an extension cord plugged into the wall. She holds the ends of the cords in each hand and tells Spencer to stay away from her. She notices bloody nail marks on Spencer's hand and she knows that her sister really is dead, as she dreamed. She tells Spencer she does not know who he is, that he killed her sister and her husband. He tells her he did, and that he lives inside of her now. Water begins pouring down from the ceiling, as Jillian turned on all of the water in the bathroom upstairs. Spencer is engulfed in the water, Jillian lifts her feet off the wet floor, connects the cords and electrocutes the alien. The alien leaves Spencer's body and transmits into Jillian.\n\nJillian has remarried and her twin sons are off on their first day of school. Her sons look back before boarding the bus with a look on their face before they smile and are on their way. Jillian assures the stepfather that he is now their father.\n\nThe movie was a box office bomb. Domestically, it grossed $4,027,003 in its opening weekend, and finished with $10,672,566. The film made $8,926,022 in foreign markets, bringing its total box office gross to $19,598,588.\n\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 15% based on 59 reviews; the average rating is 4.26/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Despite the best efforts of its talented leads, \"The Astronaut's Wife\" moves at a snail's pace and fails to generate enough intrigue to keep viewers engaged.\" Metacritic rated it 37/100, based on 17 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nJoe Leydon of \"Variety\" wrote, \"\"Rosemary's Baby\" gets an extraterrestrial twist in \"The Astronaut's Wife\", an aggressively stylish but dramatically flaccid drama that plays like an upscale reprise of a '50s sci-fi potboiler,\" while Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" rated it C+ and wrote, \"The movie is far from incompetent; it simply has too few surprises to justify its indulgent atmosphere of malignant revelation.\" Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the direction is better than she expected but the writing is \"ridiculously derivative,\" while Mick LaSalle of \"The San Francisco Chronicle\" stated, \"The movie might not be perfect, but it deserved better than to be dumped into theaters. I rather enjoyed it.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described it as \"a moderately diverting thriller that builds suspense and entertains effectively\".\n\n\"The Astronaut's Wife\" was nominated for Best Film at the Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival in 1999.\n\n"}

He was educated at Berkhamsted Boys school. At the age of 18, Tilman was commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery and fought in the First World War, including the Battle of the Somme, and was twice awarded the Military Cross for bravery. His climbing career, however, began with his acquaintance with Eric Shipton in Kenya, East Africa, where they were both coffee growers. Beginning with their joint traverse of Mount Kenya in 1929 and their ascents of Kilimanjaro and the fabled \"Mountains of the Moon\" Ruwenzori, Shipton and Tilman formed one of the most famed partnerships in mountaineering history. When it came time to leave Africa, Tilman was not content with merely flying home but rode a bicycle across the continent to the West Coast where he embarked for England.\n\nHe volunteered for service in the Second World War; he first saw action during the Battle of France helping to cover the retreat in Flanders before getting to the beaches at Dunkirk. Tilman then served in North Africa, Iraq and Iran before being called on for special duty in 1943. He then was dropped by parachute into Albania behind enemy lines to fight with Albanian and Italian partisans. For his actions there he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his efforts, and was given the keys to the city of Belluno which he helped save from occupation and destruction.\n\nTilman was involved in two of the 1930s Mount Everest expeditions - participating in the 1935 Reconnaissance Expedition, and reaching 27,200 feet without oxygen as the expedition leader in 1938. He penetrated the Nanda Devi sanctuary with Eric Shipton in 1934, and in 1936 he went on to lead an Anglo-American expedition to Nanda Devi. With the support of a team which included Peter Lloyd and H. Adams Carter, Tilman and Noel Odell succeeded in making the first ascent of the mountain, which remained the highest summit climbed by man until 1950. Tilman later described their arrival on the summit:\n\nIn 1939, Tilman was the first man to attempt climbing in the remote and unexplored Assam Himalaya, exploring the Southern approaches of Gori Chen, 6538 metres, before his team succumbed to malaria. In 1947 he attempted Rakaposhi, then made his way to Kashgar to join up with Eric Shipton in a lightweight attempt on Muztagh Ata, 7546 metres, which nearly succeeded. On his way back to India, he detoured through Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor to see the source of the river Oxus. During his extensive exploration of the areas of Langtang, Ganesh and Manang in Nepal in 1949, Tilman was the first to ascend Paldor, 5896 metres, and found the pass named after him beyond Gangchempo.\n\nHe was awarded in 1952 the Royal Geographical Society's Founder's Gold Medal for his achievements.\n\nFollowing his military career behind enemy lines in the Second World War, Tilman took up deep sea sailing. Sailing in deep seas on the Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter \"Mischief\", which he purchased in 1954, and subsequently on his other pilot cutters \"Sea Breeze\" and \"Baroque\", Tilman voyaged to Arctic and Antarctic waters in search of new and uncharted mountains to climb. On his last voyage in 1977, in his eightieth year, Tilman was invited to ship as crew in \"En Avant\" with mountaineers sailing to the South Atlantic to climb Smith Island. The expedition was led, and the boat skippered, by the youthful Simon Richardson. He and his crew aboard the old, converted steel tug made it successfully and without incident to Rio de Janeiro. Thereafter, en route to the Falkland Islands, they disappeared without trace - it was presumed the ship had foundered with all hands.\n\n\nSources:\n\nH.W.Tilman, the seven Mountain Travel Books\n\nH.W.Tilman, the eight Sailing / Mountain exploration Books\n\n\n\n"}

It was released in March 1978, two years after its predecessor, \"Wings at the Speed of Sound\". The album had a long and tumultuous gestation during which the band's tour plans for 1977 were cancelled, due to Linda McCartney becoming pregnant with her and Paul McCartney's third child and two members of Wings having departed, leaving the band as a trio comprising Paul, Linda and Denny Laine. Recording sessions were held intermittently over a period of a year, mainly at Abbey Road Studios in London and aboard a luxury yacht in the Virgin Islands.\n\n\"London Town\" charted in the top five positions in the UK and the US. It failed to repeat the enduring success of Wings' three previous albums, however, and received unfavourable reviews from the majority of music critics. The lead single, \"With a Little Luck\", was a number 1 hit in the US, but the album's subsequent singles achieved only minor chart success. Also recorded during the sessions was the 1977 non-album single \"Mull of Kintyre\", which, until 1984, was the best-selling single in UK chart history.\n\nAfter the commercial success of 1976, with \"Wings at the Speed of Sound\" and the well received Wings Over the World tour, Wings' leader Paul McCartney planned on making 1977 a similar year. In February, Wings began recording sessions at Abbey Road Studios, which continued until the end of March. Wings recorded five songs there: \"Girls' School\", \"Name and Address\", \"London Town\", \"Children, Children\" and Linda McCartney's \"B-Side to Seaside\". The latter was issued as the flip-side of the Wings single \"Seaside Woman\" (issued under the name \"Suzy and the Red Stripes\"). The initial plan that Wings would tour in the US once more was thwarted by Linda's discovery that she was pregnant with her and Paul's third child. With the knowledge that they were not going to tour and had time at their disposal – and once again looking for different locales to record in – Wings found themselves moored on a yacht called \"Fair Carol\" in the Virgin Islands during the month of May where several new songs were recorded. Reflecting the nautical locale, the album's working title was \"Water Wings\". As Linda's pregnancy progressed, the band halted the sessions for the album, except for the recording of a new track called \"Mull of Kintyre\" that August and the completion of the already begun \"Girls' School\". The two songs were released as a single in late 1977 – Wings' only new release that year.\n\nBefore the single's release came two defections from Wings: drummer Joe English had become homesick for America and returned home, and lead guitarist Jimmy McCulloch left Wings to join the Small Faces that September. For the first time since 1973's \"Band on the Run\", Wings were down to the core three of Paul, Linda and Denny Laine, as reflected on the picture sleeve of the single. Laine co-wrote five of the tracks.\n\nIn November, two months after the birth of the McCartneys' son James, and shortly after sessions for \"London Town\" resumed, the Scottish tribute \"Mull of Kintyre\" was released to enormous commercial success. The song became the UK's biggest-selling single, outstripping the Beatles' largest seller \"She Loves You\". Although it would be topped in 1984 by Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\", \"Mull of Kintyre\" still ranks as the UK's fourth biggest-selling single and the largest selling non-charity single.\n\nRecording for \"London Town\" was completed with some final overdubbing in January 1978. Its release was preceded by the single \"With a Little Luck\", which became a number 1 hit in the US, and took place on 31 March. The album also features the song \"Girlfriend\", which American pop star Michael Jackson subsequently covered on his 1979 album \"Off the Wall\".\n\n\"London Town\" received generally unfavourable reviews from music critics. In the charts, it peaked at number 4 in the UK and number 2 in the US, where it sold over one million copies and went platinum. After a strong start initially, however, it lacked the staying power of Wings' previous releases. The album's follow-up singles, \"I've Had Enough\" and the title track, became relatively minor hits. The album marked the end of Wings' commercial peak and the beginning of a minor commercial slump for McCartney. On 14 May 1978, Paul and Linda McCartney were interviewed for BBC Radio's \"The Simon Bates Show\" to endorse the album and the single \"With a Little Luck\".\nPaul McCartney was reportedly displeased with Capitol Records in the US, where \"Mull of Kintyre\" was ignored by radio programmers; its B-side, \"Girls School\", reached only number 33 on the US charts. He was further dismayed at what he viewed as Capitol's lacklustre promotion for \"London Town\". With his contract at an end, he signed up with Columbia Records for North America (remaining with EMI elsewhere in the world) and would stay there until 1984, before returning to Capitol in the US.\n\nIn 1993, \"London Town\" was remastered and reissued on CD as part of the \"Paul McCartney Collection\" series. \"Mull of Kintyre\" and \"Girls School\" were added as bonus tracks. Laine included versions of \"Children Children\" and \"Deliver Your Children\" on his 1996 album \"Wings at the Sound of Denny Laine\".\n\nAll songs written by Paul McCartney, except where noted.\n\nAdditional tracks on 1993 CD reissue\n\n"}

Meads was exploring the South China Sea and laid claim to the islands and took the name King James I. Descendants of Meads have continued to posit legitimacy over the islands, and ownership of the island's resources. \n\nA rival entity called the \"Kingdom of Humanity\" formed in 1914 under the leadership of Franklin M. Meads, the son of James George. The two rival factions continued their claim on the islands during World War II, when they were occupied by Japanese troops. Franklin died in 1945, and his son Josiah took over leadership; Josiah himself died soon after. His son, Morton F. Meads, was to succeed but was deemed too young. The Kingdom of Humanity reunified back into the republic in 1963.\n\nThe Kingdom faded into obscurity over the next decade until 1972, when the then-ruling Morton Meads unsuccessfully petitioned the United Nations, Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China, and the Philippines to recognise the Kingdom and its claims. Later that year, the remainder of the Kingdom's governing body drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Philippines during Typhoon Ora, except for Meads.\n\nThe Kingdom reappeared in 1985 when Meads sued the United States and others for $25 billion, claiming \"unfair competition, harassment, [and] sabotage.\" The case was not heard.\n\n\n"}

It was the busiest airport in Ecuador by passenger traffic, by aircraft movement and by cargo movement, and one of the busiest airports in South America. It was named after Venezuelan-born Antonio José de Sucre, a hero of Ecuadorian and Latin American independence. It began operations in 1960, and during its last years of operation, handled about 6.2 million passengers and 164,000 metric tons of freight per year. The airport, one of the highest in the world (at AMSL) was located in the northern part of the city, in the Chaupicruz parish, within five minutes of Quito's financial center; the terminals were located at the intersection of Amazonas and La Prensa avenues. Mariscal Sucre International was the largest hub for TAME with an average of 50 daily departures.\n\nThe old Mariscal Sucre International Airport ceased all operations at 19:00 on February 19, 2013, following the departure of TAME flight 321 to Guayaquil (scheduled for 18:55). Iberia operated the final international departure from the airport. On the morning of February 20, 2013, all operations moved to the new Mariscal Sucre International Airport. The first domestic flights scheduled to arrive at the new airport were TAME Flight 302 originating in Guayaquil, and LAN Flight 2590 originating in Lima, Peru. The new airport is located in the Tababela parish, about to the east of the city. It was constructed by a private consortium.\n\nThe former airport is now the site of Parque Bicentenario, the biggest urban park in Quito.\n\nDue to its location in the middle of a city surrounded by mountains, the old airport could no longer be expanded to accommodate any larger aircraft or an increase in air traffic. Its operation posed risks; several serious accidents and incidents had occurred in years prior to its closure.\n\nMariscal Sucre International Airport was inaugurated in 1960, the main terminal was designed during the government of President Velasco Ibarra. The present terminal and concourses (A, B and C) were refurbished in 2003, consisting of several taxiways, maintenance platforms, parking areas, a cellar, passenger halls, mezzanine areas and other amenities. Terminal B consisted of two floors; the lower level held the departures area with executive waiting rooms and restaurants, and the upper level consisted of airline and airport offices.\n\nThe airport had ten gates, five with Jet bridges and five with stairs.\n\nOn 10 December 2000, TAME officially opened its hub in Quito, offering an estimated 2,000 possible connections per week, including greater numbers of frequencies, schedules and destinations served. Connections between domestic and international destinations were operated directly and through code sharing agreements with airlines such as TACA Airlines and Copa Airlines.\n\nOperations out of Quito allowed travelers to connect between domestic destinations (such as Guayaquil to Galápagos), from a domestic destination to an international destination (Such as Tena to Cali), from an international destination to a domestic city (Such as Cali to Tulcán), between two international destinations (Such as Bogota to Panama City) and allows for simpler codeshare connections (such as Lima to Santa Rosa with TACA Airlines and TAME).\n\nThe hub also featured facilities for easier transits, such as exclusive check-in counters for travelers in transit, buses for internal transportation between Terminals A & B, and two special lounges for national and international transit passengers to avoid having to go through Ecuadorian customs and immigration between transits.\n\nTAME's hub transferred to Mariscal Sucre International Airport in Tababela in February 19, 2013.\n\nThe airport consisted of one terminal split into a national and international areas. It was equipped with five swing gates capable of directing arriving passengers to either Immigration or to baggage claim. In addition, there were numerous ground slots where passengers walked to the aircraft from the terminal.\n\nMariscal Sucre Airport had 4 VIP Salons in the terminals A and B. For passengers of AeroGal, there was an exclusive salon near gate 2,\"AeroGal VIP Club\". Passengers of TAME had access to the \"TAME\" VIP Lounge in terminal B, a lounge that was exclusively for first and business class passengers. This area was nominated as the best VIP lounge of the year in Ecuador, the \"QUIPORT VIP Club\", and a lesser VIP Lounge, the \"American Airlines Admirals Club\" in the gate 10.\n\nTransportation between the airport and city was provided by taxis, tour buses and vans. For security reasons, visitors were recommended to take only those taxis offered by registered companies at the airport Terminal A arrivals area.\n\nThe airlines in bold are operative, the airlines with \"cursive\" are operative, but no longer serves Quito.\n\nThis terminal served national arrivals and departures, the airlines that served here were:\n\n\"(Incomplete list)\"\n\n\nThis terminal served international arrivals and departures, the airlines, defunct or still operating, were:\n\n\"(Incomplete list)\"\n\n\nThese destinations were operated from the Cargo Terminal.\n\n\n\n"}

It is not a true symphysis as there is no cartilage between the two sides of the mandible. Fibres at the back of the muscle cross the mandible, some being inserted into the bone below the oblique line, others into the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the lower part of the face. Many of these fibers blend with the muscles about the angle and lower part of the mouth.\n\nSometimes fibers can be traced to the zygomaticus, or to the margin of the orbicularis oris. Beneath the platysma, the external jugular vein descends from the angle of the mandible to the clavicle.\n\nVariations occur in the extension over the face and over the clavicle and shoulder; it may be absent or interdigitate with the muscle of the opposite side in front of the neck; attachment to clavicle, mastoid process or occipital bone occurs. A more or less independent fasciculus, the occipitalis minor, may extend from the fascia over the trapezius to fascia over the insertion of the sternocleidomastoideus.\n\nThe platysma is innervated by cervical branch of the facial nerve.\n\nThe platysma is supplied by branches of the Submental artery and Suprascapular artery.\n\nWhen the entire platysma is in action it produces a slight wrinkling of the surface of the skin of the neck in an oblique direction. Its anterior portion, the thickest part of the muscle, depresses the lower jaw; it also serves to draw down the lower lip and angle of the mouth in the expression of melancholy, i.e. surprise or horror. However, the platysma plays only a minor role in depressing the lip which is primarily performed by the depressor anguli oris and the depressor labii inferioris.\n\nIn a similar fashion to other muscles, the platysma is vulnerable to tears, strains and muscle atrophy among many other possible conditions.\n\nThe platysma is vulnerable to neck injuries that may penetrate it. A type of medical imaging called CTA (computed tomography angiography), used to visualise arterial and venous vessels, is useful to minimise the number of neck explorations, thus improving the handling of the condition.\n\nAnother area of importance of the platysma lies in plastic surgery. Neck bands in the area become most noticeable with age, aggravated by weightlifting or facelift. If it doesn't heal with time, there are many options to correct this: Botox/Dysport/Xeomin and platysmaplasty. Platysmaplasty is a surgery in this area, that can be open or closed, in the latter a specialised instrument called plastymotome that allow the surgery to be done without incisions. It takes approximately 2 weeks for the symptoms to be reduced.\n\n"}

They were all introduced in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on June 19, 2002 when they competed in the Gauntlet for the Gold: an over-the-top rope elimination match in which the final two competitors face off in a one-fall singles match to crown the first NWA World Heavyweight Champion of the TNA era. Malice and Ken Shamrock were the last two remaining in the Gauntlet for the gold match, with Ken Shamrock winning via pinfall, thus leading up to a feud between him and The New Church.\n\nOn the next PPV, the following week, The New Church interrupted a speech by Ken Shamrock. James Mitchell challenged Shamrock to a match with his Disciple, Malice, for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, and Ken Shamrock agreed. Then Malice attacked Shamrock from behind in the ring and gave him a chokeslam. On July 3, Ken Shamrock was attacked by Malice backstage before their match even started, but Ken Shamrock competed to face Malice in the ring regardless and retained his NWA World Title after he defeated Malice in a singles match. On July 10, Slash and Tempest got a shot at the Tag Team Titles against A.J. Styles and Jerry Lynn but were defeated. Malice had another chance at a shot at the NWA title, when he faced Sabu in a number one contenders ladder match on July 17, but lost. On July 24, Malice stole the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Ken Shamrock after he retained it in a ladder match with Sabu, but on July 31, Shamrock got it back when TNA security Don Harris interrupted after a match involving Malice and Apolo, taking the NWA World Heavyweight Championship away from Malice to bring it to its rightful owner, Ken Shamrock.\n\nAfter Malice's brief feud with Ken Shamrock, he started feuding with Don Harris. On August 7, Malice and Harris wrestled each other in a first blood match, and then on August 14, they wrestled again in a last man standing match. After their last man standing match, both of them shook hands in respect for their match together. Malice then left The Disciples of the New Church. Cobain then became a part of the stable, and made a tag team with Slash. Cobain and Slash wrestled together as tag teams in TNA throughout August and September 2002, but then made a short disappearance.\n\n\"The Disciples of the New Church\" returned to TNA on October 30, 2002. Brian Lee became the newest member after their return and made a tag team with Slash, along with James Mitchell as manager and Bella Donna as their valet. They attacked the then current NWA World Tag Team Champions, America's Most Wanted (James Storm and Chris Harris) demanding a shot at the NWA Tag Team Championships. On November 6, \"The New Church\" members Slash and Brian Lee wrestled against America's Most Wanted in a tag team match for the NWA Tag Titles, but lost via disqualification. The New Church members Brian Lee and Slash, however, defeated America's Most Wanted the following week on November 13, in another tag team match, becoming the new NWA World Tag Team Champions. On November 20, America's Most Wanted wrestled against The New Church in a rematch, but lost. The New Church successfully defended their titles throughout December 2002 before dropping the titles back to AMW in their final encounter on January 8, 2003 PPV. Bella Donna then left The Disciples of the New Church.\n\n\"The Disciples of the New Church\" turned babyfaces when they joined the battle with Team Extreme (Sandman, Perry Saturn and New Jack) and the NWA against Sports Entertainment Xtreme (S.E.X.). On April 9, Disciples turned on Team Extreme in a three-way tag team match by attacking them through a fireball in Sandman's face. They battled Team Extreme and The Gathering throughout the entire year before they were taken out by Raven one by one.\n\nOn March 5, 2013, Slash and Sinn appeared at TNA One Night Only Hardcore Justice 2.

{"id": "2207781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207781", "title": "Cross-tolerance", "text": "Cross-tolerance\n\nCross-tolerance is a phenomenon that occurs when tolerance to the effects of a certain drug produces tolerance to another drug. It often happens between two drugs with similar functions or effects—for example, acting on the same cell receptor or affecting the transmission of certain neurotransmitters. Cross-tolerance has been observed with pharmaceutical drugs such as anti-anxiety agents and illicit substances, and sometimes the two of them together. Often, a person who uses one drug can be tolerant to a drug that has a completely different function. This phenomenon allows one to become tolerant to a drug that they have never even used before.\n\nExcitation of the GABA receptor produces an influx of negatively charged chloride ions, which hyperpolarizes the neuron and makes it less likely to give rise to an action potential. In addition to gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) itself, the GABA receptor can also bind barbiturates and benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepine binding increases the binding of GABA and barbiturates maximize the time the pore is open. Both of these mechanisms allow for influx of chloride ions. When these drugs are taken together, especially with ethanol (drinking alcohol), there is a disproportionate increase in toxicity because the effects of both occur simultaneously and add up since they act on the same receptor at different sites. Convergence upon the GABA receptor is why tolerance for one drug in the group will most likely cause cross-tolerance for the other drugs in the group. However, the barbiturates are also AMPA receptor blockers, and in addition interact with the nAChR and voltage-gated calcium channels. As a result, somebody who is tolerant to benzodiazepines is more sensitive to barbiturates than vice versa.\n\nThese drugs block dopamine receptors and some also block serotonin receptors (such as chlorpromazine, the first antipsychotic used clinically). Having been on one or more antipsychotics for any appreciable amount of time results in dramatically reduced sensitivity to others with similar mechanisms of action. However, an antipsychotic with a substantial disparity in pharmacology (e.g. haloperidol and quetiapine) may retain significant efficacy.\n\nMAO inhibitor drugs block an enzyme system resulting in increased stores of monoamine neurotransmitters. More common antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs block reuptake transporters causing increased levels of norepinephrine or serotonin in synapses. Mood stabilizers include lithium and many anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine and lamotrigine are also used for mood disorders. This would demonstrate little to zero cross-tolerance with serotonergic or lithium treatment.\n\nThese drugs mimic three classes of endorphins, such as endomorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins. All three of these classes each have their own receptor-mu, kappa, and delta. Opioids will bind to the receptor for the endorphin they are most chemically similar to. Tolerance to some effects occurs with regular use, a result of the downregulation of the stimulated opioid receptors. Cross tolerance to analgesia may develop incompletely and less rapidly, allowing rotation between opioid medications be used to compensate somewhat for tolerance. This phenomenon is called \"incomplete cross-tolerance\".\n\nCocaine, amphetamines, methylphenidate and ephedrine block the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. With increasing doses, amphetamines also cause the direct release of these neurotransmitters.\n\nSerotonergic psychedelics act through modulation of serotonin receptors. Most of these drugs share a high affinity for the 5-HT receptor subtype, known to result in their common perceptual and psychological effects.\n\nSometimes cross-tolerance occurs between two drugs that do not share mechanisms of action or classification. For example, amphetamine and amphetamine-like stimulants have been shown to exhibit cross-tolerance with caffeine, and it is likely the mechanism of cross-tolerance involves the dopamine receptor D. Amphetamines also have cross-tolerance with pseudoephedrine, as pseudoephedrine can block dopamine uptake in the same manner that amphetamines do, but less potently.\n\nAlcohol is another substance that often cross-tolerates with other drugs. Findings of cross-tolerance with nicotine in animal models suggest that it is also possible in humans, and may explain why the two drugs are often used together. Numerous studies have also suggested the possibility of cross-tolerance between alcohol and cannabis.\n"}

The rate of this energy transfer depends on the strength of the EM field components. Simply put, the rate of energy transfer per unit area (power density) is the product of the electric field strength (E) times the magnetic field strength (H).\n\nwhere\n\nThe above equation yields units of W/m . In the USA the units of mW/cm, are more often used when making surveys. One mW/cm is the same power density as 10 W/m. The following equation can be used to obtain these units directly:\n\nThe simplified relationships stated above apply at distances of about two or more wavelengths from the radiating source. This distance can be a far distance at low frequencies, and is called the far field. Here the ratio between E and H becomes a fixed constant (377 Ohms) and is called the characteristic impedance of free space. Under these conditions we can determine the power density by measuring only the E field component (or H field component, if you prefer) and calculating the power density from it.\n\nThis fixed relationship is useful for measuring radio frequency or microwave (electromagnetic) fields. Since power is the rate of energy transfer, and the squares of E and H are proportional to power, E and H are proportional to the energy transfer rate and the energy absorption of a given material.\n\nThe region extending farther than about 2 wavelengths away from the source is called the far field. As the source emits electromagnetic radiation of a given wavelength, the far-field electric component of the wave E, the far-field magnetic component H, and power density are related by the equations: E = H × 377 and Pd = E × H.\n"}

It was also home to the Old Man of the Mountain, until that formation collapsed on May 3, 2003.\n\nCannon has three sub-peaks with heights of 3,693, 3,700, and 3,769 feet (1,125, 1,127 and 1,148 m), collectively known as \"The Cannon Balls.\" Geologically, it is an exfoliating granite dome. Part of the Kinsman Range, the mountain is located within Franconia Notch State Park.\n\nRock climbers were pioneering routes on Cannon's cliffs in the 1920s. Its ski area is one of the oldest in North America. Trails had been cut on the mountain prior to 1933, but the mountain gained widespread recognition that year when the Taft Slalom was cut as the first racing trail in North America. The mountain gained lift service with the construction of the first aerial tramway in North America, in 1938. A new tram was erected in 1980 with a vertical ascent of 2,022 feet (616.3 m) and a capacity of 140 people (two seventy-person cabins), roughly three times larger than the original lift. The old tram base and summit-stations remain intact, and one of the old cabins serves as the entranceway to the New England Ski Museum, opened in 1982 at the mountain's base area. The museum houses what it calls \"the most extensive collection of historical ski equipment, clothing, film, photographs, literature, and artwork in the East\" and is one of four museums in the U.S. to be recognized by the United States Ski Association as a Regional Museum.\n\nCannon hosted the first Alpine Skiing World Cup races ever held in North America in 1967, with races being listed as occurring at Franconia.\n\nIn 1972, the US Board on Geographic Names officially changed the name from \"Profile Mountain\", which it had been called officially since 1917, to Cannon Mountain. The two names both are derived from natural rock formations featured on the mountain; the former being the famous \"Old Man of the Mountain\" and the latter being a series of boulders which, when viewed from the foot of the mountain, resemble an antique cannon. Before being called Profile Mountain, the mountain was also called Frank Mountain.\n\nOn April 2, 1973, the second strongest surface wind gust ever recorded in the United States of America was measured by University of Massachusetts Amherst researchers on the summit. Although wind velocity maxima were measured at , this reading represents the physical limit of the recording instrument, and thus the true value may have been quite higher. Only the record value measured on nearby Mount Washington in 1934 exceeds this value in terms of American wind extrema.\n\nThe summit of Cannon Mountain is home to a UHF amateur radio repeater on 449.875 MHz as well as two repeaters belonging to the ABC affiliate WMUR-TV.\n\nCannon Mountain and its base area host a variety of year-round sports, including hiking, climbing, skiing and fishing. Visiting tourists can take in the area's scenery, an aerial tramway, summit restaurant, and a museum on the history of skiing.\n\nA number of trails criss-cross Cannon Mountain and the surrounding region. The Kinsman Ridge Trail begins on the northeast side of the mountain in Franconia Notch near the base of the Tramway, passes near but not directly over the summit, and leads to the southwest across the Cannon Balls and the Kinsman peaks on to Kinsman Notch at the north base of Mount Moosilauke. The Mittersill-Cannon Trail, seasonally open from spring to fall, climbs to the summit area from the northwest, traversing Mittersill Peak on its climb. Both trails join the Rim Trail near the summit, which in turn climbs to the summit tower in a loop partially overlapped by the KRT. Lonesome Lake, on the south side of the mountain, is a popular hiking destination and is the location of the Appalachian Mountain Club-maintained Lonesome Lake Hut. The Appalachian Trail passes Lonesome Lake but does not cross the summit of Cannon. The base of the cliff face can be approached via an ambiguous path up the right side of the talus field.\n\nAt roughly high and more than long, Cannon Cliff is the largest vertical rock face in the Northeast. According to a SummitPost description, \"Some of the aid lines are long and difficult enough to require a bivy, making Cannon the only Big Wall in the northeast.\" Cannon is popular with free- and aid-climbers in summer and ice- and mixed climbers in winter. (V)Ice Fest, an annual ice climbing festival, is held in the Franconia Notch region and features climbing on Cannon Cliff.\n\nClimbers are asked to sign in and out of a log book so that search parties may be organized if they are overdue. Several rock and ice guide books exist for Cannon and Franconia Notch, most notably 'Secrets of the Notch' by Jon Sykes.\n\nNotable rock climbing routes:\n\nNotable ice climbing routes:\n\nThe approach trail to Cannon cliff can be found by walking along the bike path on the western (southbound) side of I-93. Climbers park and sign in at a trailhead lot just south of Profile Lake. After about of narrow, climber-maintained trails through the woods, climbers must cross a long section of talus.\n\nSteep unofficial descent trails back to the trailhead can be found on both the north and south ends of the cliff, above Whitney-Gilman and Lakeside, respectively.\n\nThe Cannon Mountain Ski Area is state-owned and offers nine lifts servicing of skiing (158 with snowmaking). In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps cut six ski trails, many of which were later incorporated into the Cannon Mountain Ski Area and, until 1984, the Mittersill Ski Area. The Mittersill Ski Area and Taft CCC Ski Trail were incorporated into the Cannon Mountain Ski Area in 2009.\n\nUS Olympic gold medal winning skier Bode Miller grew up skiing at Cannon.\n\nCannon has a number of non-sport-related features which make it a popular tourist attraction. The aerial tramway operates year-round. Though the lift terminates at the summit of the ski area, which is not the peak of the mountain itself, two hiking trails (the Cannon Mountain Short Trail and the Rim Trail) provide a way to the summit. The tramway opens for the summer season in mid-May and closes in mid-October, and is open daily from 9am to 5pm. There, an observation tower provides a panoramic view of the White Mountains Region. The Old Man of the Mountain was a popular attraction until its collapse in spring 2003; the Old Man of the Mountain Historic Site remains an attraction. Also notable is Profile Lake, a lake popular with both fly fisherman and anglers, and the New England Ski Museum.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2207795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207795", "title": "Thomas Barbour", "text": "Thomas Barbour\n\nThomas Barbour (August 19, 1884 – January 8, 1946) was an American herpetologist. From 1927 until 1946, he was director of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) founded in 1859 by Louis Agassiz at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nBarbour, the eldest of four brothers, was born in 1884 to Colonel William Barbour, and his wife, Julia Adelaide Sprague. Colonel Barbour was founder and president of The Linen Thread Company, Inc., a successful thread manufacturing enterprise having much business in the United States, Ireland, and Scotland. Although born on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, where the family was spending the summer, Barbour grew up in Monmouth, New Jersey, where one of his younger brothers, William Warren Barbour, entered the political arena, eventually serving as U.S. Senator from New Jersey from 1931 to 1937 and again from 1938 to 1943.\n\nAt age fifteen, Thomas Barbour was taken to visit Harvard University, which, entranced by its Museum of Comparative Zoology, he later attended. At Harvard, he studied under Alexander Agassiz, son of Louis Agassiz. Having received his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. from that university, Barbour joined the faculty in 1911 when his doctoral dissertation was published, and he took on the position of curator of reptiles and amphibians at the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Eventually he became the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology and, in 1927, director of the museum. Although primarily interested in reptiles and amphibians, he also studied birds and insects, particularly butterflies. His biological interests, however, were remarkably diversified, and he is considered to be one of the last of a dying breed: a general naturalist.\n\nHis scientific travels took him through Africa, Asia, North America, South America, and Central America, among other regions. He particularly enjoyed Panama, Costa Rica, and Cuba, which he visited at length on at least thirty occasions beginning in 1908, generally staying in Soledad at the Harvard Botanical Gardens. Barbour served as custodian of these gardens from 1927 until his death in 1946. In his book, \"Naturalist in Cuba\", Barbour writes, \"I suspect that I am the only living American naturalist who has visited all parts of the island again and again, for I am not only a Cuban by adoption, but a devoted friend of the land and its people.\" In addition to the expected scientific discussion of the island's flora and fauna, Barbour provides a description of Cuban society and culture.\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1916. In 1923 and 1924, he was one of the scientists and financial benefactors who founded the Barro Colorado Island Laboratory in Panama, location of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. The island, originally a hilltop, sits in the middle of Gatun Lake, which was created when the Chagres River was dammed during the Panama Canal building project.\n\nAlong with better than 400 scholarly articles, Barbour wrote several books including the autobiographical \"Naturalist at Large\" (1943), \"Naturalist in Cuba\" (1945), \"A Naturalist's Scrapbook\" (1946), and \"That Vanishing Eden\" (1944), which explores the natural world of a remote, undeveloped Florida.\n\nIn 1906, Barbour married Rosamond Pierce of Brookline, Massachusetts. A two-year honeymoon took them through remote reaches of the Dutch East Indies, India, Burma, Java, China, and New Guinea with Barbour's wife helping him to photograph animals and collect specimens. Their union resulted in six children and eleven grandchildren. The family home was on Clarendon Street in Boston's Back Bay, with summers spent in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1927 Barbour was made director of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology and, in 1931, organized and sent an expedition to Australia for the dual purpose of procuring specimens - the museum being \"weak in Australian animals and...desires[ing] to complete its series\" - and to engage in \"the study of the animals of the region when alive.\" The Harvard Australian Expedition (1931–1932), as it became known, was a six-man venture led by Harvard Professor William Morton Wheeler, with the others being Dr. P. Jackson Darlington, Jr. (a renowned coleopterist), Dr. Glover Morrill Allen and his student Ralph Nicholson Ellis, medical officer Dr. Ira M. Dixon, and William E. Schevill (a graduate-student in his twenties and Associate Curator of Invertebrate Palaeontology). Barbour said at the time \"We shall hope for specimens' of the kangaroo, the wombat, the Tasmanian devil and Tasmanian wolf,\" and the mission was a success with over 300 mammal and thousands of insect specimens returning to the United States.\n\nDuring the last two years of his life he was in failing health, following a blood clot that had developed while he was in Miami. He was at the Museum of\nComparative Zoology as usual on January 4, 1946, and in happy mood at home in Boston that evening. But he was stricken later in the night with cerebral hemorrhage, and died on January 8, without regaining consciousness.\n\nFor many years, Barbour and Darlington had friendly arguments about Barbour's advocacy of faunal dispersion by land bridges versus Darlington's advocacy of exreme-wind-borne dispersal of small animals over isolated islands. To test his ideas, Darlington dropped several live frogs from a window on the fifth floor of the Museum. Barbour and a crowd of spectators observed the experiment. The dropped frogs were stunned\nand remained still for a few seconds, but almost immediately they started to recover and in a few minutes were hopping normally.\n\nThomas Barbour is commemorated in the scientific names of the following species and subspecies of reptiles.\nAlso, the street he grew up on was named after him, Thomas Barbour Drive, in Melbourne, Florida; the street on which Ballard Park is located.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2207809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207809", "title": "Centre Union", "text": "Centre Union\n\nThe Centre Union (EK, Greek: Ένωσις Κέντρου, \"Enosis Kentrou\" (ΕΚ) was a Greek political party, created in 1961 by Georgios Papandreou.\n\nThe Centre Union was a political party in Greece in the 1960s which held office from 1963-1965 and was nominally in power from 1965–1967. The party was centrist, though elements of the far-right and the left also joined. The party fractured following its leader Georgios Papandreou's resignation after a disagreement with King Constantine II who clashed with Papandreou on how to handle the armed forces. Papandreou was succeeded by several shaky governments which relied on the votes of the opposition and defectors from the Centre Union. The turmoil surrounding Papandreou's resignation became known as the 'Apostasy' which led directly to the Greek military junta of 1967-1974.\n\nThe Centre Union was founded in September 1961, six weeks before the elections of the same year. The forces of the centre, chiefly consisting of the Liberal Democratic Party (Fileleftheron Dimokratikon Komma), a splinter party from the Liberal Party surrounding Georgios Papandreou, the Liberal Party (Komma Fileleftheron) of Sofoklis Venizelos and the New Political Forces (Nea Politiki Kinisis. These parties appeared in the wake of the 1958 Legislative Election which resulted in the Liberal Party under the joint leadership of Venizelos and Papandreou, coming third, having been eclipsed by the socialist United Democratic Left (Eniaa Dimokratiki Aristera). On the centre-left was added the National Progressive Centre Union (Ethniki Proodeftiki Enosis Kentrou) and the Party of Peasants and Workers (Komma Agrotikon kai Ergazomenon), Ilias Tsirimokos’ Democratic Union party (Dimokratiki Enosis) and on the right, Stefanos Stefanopoulos’ Popular Social Party (Laikon Koinonikon Komma), a breakaway group from the Greek Rally, and the Party of the Nationally Minded (Komma Ethnikiphronon). Smaller, less influential figures were brought into the fold, namely Stylianos Allamanis and Pafsanias Katsotas. All constituent parts recognised the sole leadership of Georgios Papandreou.\n\nUpon receiving the leadership of the Centre Union, Georgios Papandreou declared his immediate objective to be the reduction of the EDA vote to less than 20% so that the two ‘nationally-minded’ parties, EK and the ruling National Radical Union (Ethniki Rizospastiki Enosis, ERE), could contest the elections within the framework of democracy.\n\nOf the two major parties, the Centre Union had a more cohesive party structure. It had an official constitution, membership provisions, professional cadres, national conventions, a youth wing and formal procedures for the succession of leaders. However, not a single meeting of the highest authority in the party, the congress, ever took place.\n\nIn anticipation of the next elections, the government of Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis announced intentions of enacting a new electoral law: the proposed law was set before parliament and on 6 May, after lengthy debate, it was passed. A system of ‘reinforced’ proportional representation was introduced which gave minor parties a slight advantage in comparison with the previous law.\n\nKing Paul, in accordance with political traditions in Greece, appointed a ‘service' government headed by the chief of the royal household, General Konstantinos Dovas, to oversee the campaign period to ensure impartial conduct of the election as it was feared that the ruling party may try and tamper with the results.\n\nOn 29 September the results were fully counted: the ERE received 50.8 per cent of votes cast equating to 176 seats; the Centre Union in collaboration with Spyros Markezinis’ Progressive Party, garnered 33.7 per cent of the popular vote translating to 100 seats. The majority of the remaining votes went to the left-wing Pandemocratic Agrarian Front of Greece. Immediately the results were denounced by the extreme left and the Centre Union as illegitimate - Papandreou proclaimed that the results were ‘a product of violence and fraud’ thus inaugurating Papandreou's ‘unrelenting struggle’ for free and fair elections. Meanwhile, several days after the election, deputy leader of the EK, Sofoklis Venizelos, declared that the EK was fighting more than just the ERE, but also ‘the General Staff of the Army, the Central Intelligence Agency, the gendarmerie, the National Security Battalions and other dark forces’. General Dovas complained that all of Papandreou's demands prior to the election had been satisfied and pointed out that abstentions had been at a fifteen-year low.\n\nOn 2 December, the socialist parties and all but nine Centre Union deputies were absent from the State opening of Parliament in order to protest what they believed to be an illegal administration. Accordingly, on 7 December, without any Centre Union votes, Karamanlis received his vote of confidence by 174 votes to 21. The next stage of the EK's war against the establishment was waged against the King involving a boycott of all official functions. Duly he declined an invitation to a Court Ball celebrating King Paul's sixtieth birthday on 14 December 1961, replying ‘Mr Georgios Papandreou will not be attending’. Likewise, Sofoklis Venizelos and Spyros Markezinis excused themselves by informing the King that they could not come due to being abroad.\n\nKaramanlis’ position was undermined further when, on 27 May 1963, Grigorios Lambrakis, a left-wing deputy from Piraeus, was murdered by two men wielding clubs in the course of a peaceful protest. The Lambrakis assassination revealed a right-wing underworld when it was revealed the two killers had close links to the local gendarmerie, therefore roping in Karamanlis. While it is unlikely Karamanlis had any ties to the assassination, it placed the idea of an illegal ‘para-state’ on firmer ground.\n\nThe crisis atmosphere was heightened when Karamanlis began having spats with King Paul over a state visit to England set to take place in the Summer of 1963. Karamanlis, after reaching no agreement with the King regarding the matter, submitted his resignation, and suggested that diplomatist and outgoing ERE minister, Panagiotis Pipinelis, should be entrusted with the premiership and that elections should be held immediately. Paul also favoured Pipinelis because he, unlike Karamanlis, would support the proposed state visit to England. Paul refused immediate elections on the basis that he must not be abroad on the state visit in the midst of an election. Paul then summoned Papandreou and Markezinis who both agreed that a ‘service’ government enjoying the confidence of parliament should be appointed to prepare the ground for an election, as opposed to Karamanlis’ view that elections should be held as soon as possible. Eventually, after five days of consultations, the King called on Pipienlis, who he knew would enjoy the support of all 180 ERE deputies (thus constituting a majority), to form a government. This was not what the Centre Union had bargained for. Papandreou denounced the new government as ‘inspiring no confidence in its ability to hold fair elections’. The customary confidence vote was therefore boycotted by the Centre Union deputies who all arose from their seats and walked out. All but Sofoklis Venizelos, having promised to cast his vote for the government after two offending ministers were replaced, who informed the teller that he was giving the government a ‘vote of tolerance’. He then followed his fellow deputies and walked out.\n\nWith the state visit safely behind, Pipinelis demanded and obtained a second confidence vote, and shortly thereafter a new electoral bill was introduced to the chamber providing for another system of ‘reinforced’ proportional representation. The EK, repudiating the bill, abstained from the final vote and the bill was passed on the votes of the ERE alone.The EK threatened to boycott the upcoming elections if Pipinelis remained in power for the duration of the electoral process. Markezinis also expressed his desire for a change in government, while Karamanlis, communicating from a temporary self-imposed exile in Paris, conveyed his strong desire for Pipinelis to remain in office for the time being. On 26 September Prime Minister Pipinelis was summoned by King Paul who handed him the Royal Decree dissolving Parliament and ordering elections for 3 November. The following day Pipinelis was replaced by Stelio Mavromichales as not to agitate the EK's threats.\n\nThe Legislative Election of 3 November 1963 resulted in the Centre Union, albeit narrowly, carrying the day: the Centre Union managed to take 138 out of the 300 seats in parliament with the ERE coming second with 132 seats. The EDA took 28. On 6 November the King called on Papandreou to form a government. Georgios Papandreou was now Prime Minister. The Centre Union's victory can largely be credited to the subsiding of anti-Communism which had flared up in the years following the Civil War and the growing unemployment.\n\nPapandreou dispelled any hopes that King Paul initially held that Papandreou might seek a coalition with the ERE and announced he would only seek backing from his party and those disaffected with others. By 24 December, however, when he obtained a confidence vote, it turned out he was wrong. The ERE voted solidly against the new government, therefore, Papandreou relied on the votes of his party and the socialist EDA. Despite his party not occupying the majority of seats in Parliament, he still flatly refused any deals with the EDA which he believed to be a front for the illegal Communist Party (KKE). This view was shared by many politicians of the two ‘nationally-minded’ parties.\n\nGeorgios Papandreou headed to the polls again after laying out a vote-catching program before parliament in 1964. The 16 February Legislative Election yielded a landslide victory for Papandreou. The EK secured 52.7 per cent of the popular vote equating to 171 seats in parliament. The Centre Union were especially large in more prosperous agricultural regions, where the police's grip on power had been much weakened. The EK attracted lower middle-class voters too. The 1964-1965 government headed by Papandreou enacted overdue reforms catered towards the lower and middle class by increasing pensions and prices for farmers; the system in which elections take place in the General Confederation of Greek Workers was made fairer. The government put a lot of emphasis on education by abolishing fees for universities and secondary schools; additional university teachers were appointed; a larger intake into universities was accepted; the period of compulsory education was extended to nine years from six; primary education was to be conducted completely in demotic (common) Greek which was also to have equal status to katharevousa (purified) in secondary schools. New subjects were introduced and more emphasis was put on others. Sociology and economics were added to the curriculum subjects, while importance was put on modern languages. In total, educational expenditure increased by a third in one year, and by 1967 11.6 per cent of the budget was dedicated to education. And although Papandreou viewed the left with some hostility, he released several thousands of prisoners still behind bars from the Civil War. Only about 1000 Communists remained in prison, a large decrease from its peak of about 20,000 in the early 1960s and 50s.\n\nThe lack of cohesion between EK deputies and the leadership resulted in the collapse of the Centre Union government. A leading cause for the schism in the party was the accusation of nepotism and lust for power on the part of Georgios Papandreou. Andreas Papandreou, the son of Georgios Papandreou, was appointed First Minister of State and Minister of Coordination in 1964 the same year he was elected to Parliament. Rising stars in the party, including future premier Konstantinos Mitsotakis, felt as though the younger Papandreou had not served his time in the party required to garner him the role of what is effectively the assistant Prime Minister. Disdain of Andreas Papandreou came to a head when in May 1965, a report written by EK deputies opposed to the Papandreous accused Andreas of collaborating with ASPIDA, a grouping of left-leaning military officers.\n\nPapandreou and King Constantine II’s (Paul died in March 1964) relationship began to break down over disagreements on the handling of the armed forces. Petros Garoufalias, a royalist Centre Union deputy, enjoyed the King’s support as Minister of National Defence. In turn, Garoufalias appointed officers loyal to both the King and himself. This was not acceptable to Papandreou, whose primary goal at that point was to purge the armed forces of conspiratorial elements which were vehemently against Papandreou and even more violently against his son holding far more radical views than his aging father. Initially Papandreou retaliated against politically active officers by moving them as far away as possible from Athens, blocking their promotions or forcing their retirement, but he could only do so much without occupying the Defence Ministry as well as that of Premier. Papandreou, enjoying a healthy parliamentary majority, came to the King and demanded that he be made Defence Minister while holding the Premiership as well which was a prerequisite of replacing the Chief of Staff. The King refused on the grounds that Papandreou’s son Andreas had yet to prove himself innocent in the ASPIDA case. In disgust, Papandreou resigned, kicking off the ‘July events’ , also known as the 'Apostasy', a stormy political crisis revolving around the resignation of Papandreou.\n\nImmediately after Papandreou's resignation, a new government headed by EK defectors disaffected with the Papandreous (the ‘Apostates’), ERE deputies and 8 deputies belonging to the Progressive Party, all loyal to the standard of Apostate Speaker Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas was formed. This government fell in August and was replaced by a new one headed by Ilias Tsirimokos which fell a few weeks later in September when it failed to receive the mandatory vote of confidence. Stefanos Stefanopoulos was then appointed who obtained a confidence vote. In total, there were 45 ‘Apostates’.\n\nThe 'Apostasy' had a radicalising effect on the centre-left of the EK. This segment increasingly looked to Andreas Papandreou and at one point an abandonment from the elected leadership of Georgios Papndreou by the centre-left seemed possible.\n\nAn end to the crisis seemed in sight when on 20 December 1966, Papandreou, ERE leader Panagiotis Kanellopoulos and the King reached a resolution: elections would be held under a straightforward system of proportional representation where all parties participating agreed to compete, and that, in any outcome, the command structure of the army would not be altered. In the leadup to the election scheduled for 28 May 1967, the EK introduced a bill extending parliamentary immunity for the duration of the campaign aimed at protecting Andreas Papandreou who was still under scrutiny for his potential involvement in ASPIDA and in March 1967 fifteen officers charged with being involved in the ASPIDA affair were convicted. Interim Prime Minister Ioannis Paraskevopoulos resigned in the ensuing row and Kanellopoulos stepped in to fill the role of the Prime Minister until the May Election.\n\nDespite the crisis subsiding early on, on 21 April 1967, a month before the scheduled elections, a clique of relatively junior officers headed by Georgios Papadopoulos took over in a coup d'état. Senior officials including the two Papandreous were arrested. Georgios Papandreou died on 1 November 1968 and the Centre Union, now illegal, was placed under the titular leadership of Georgios Mavros.\n\nMavros reconstituted the Centre Union in 1974 as the Centre Union - New Forces (Enosi Kentrou - Nees Dynameis, EK - ND). The leadership was offered to Andreas Papandreou, however, he declined the offer. Papandreou instead formed the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Panellinio Sosialistiko Kinima, PASOK) and in the 1977 election, it eclipsed the centrists as the second largest party in parliament. The Centre Union rebranded as the Union of the Democratic Centre (Enosi Dimokratikou Kentrou, EDIK) in 1976, though it failed to re-enter parliament after 1985.\n\n\n"}

He was the founder of the Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A.. \nJones was born in Floyd County, Georgia. He became a missionary Baptist preacher in Jackson, Mississippi, where he met Charles Harrison Mason in 1895. In 1896, Jones, Mason, and two other preachers held a faith healing revival in Jackson. The theory of entire sanctification as taught by the Wesleyan-Holiness movement was not accepted by Baptists congregation, as Baptist hold to a progressive sanctification. In 1897, Jones and Mason left their congregations and adopted the views of the Wesleyans. They started their own church, first preaching in supporters' homes and eventually in a former gin house.\n\nJones is the author of over 1000 hymns. Some of his known hymns which are still sung around the world are \"Deeper, Deeper\"; \"I Will Make the Darkness Light\"; \"Come Unto Me\"; \"Where Shall I Be\"; \"I'm Happy With Jesus Alone\"; and \"Jesus Only\". He pastored churches in Arkansas, Mississippi, and California.\n\nIn 1907, there was a separation with Charles Mason and other ministers who returned from the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles led by William Joseph Seymour over the biblical interpretation of speaking in tongues as an evidence of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Mason carried the church name and approximately half of its congregation into Pentecostalism.\n\nIn 1909, the Christian Women Willing Workers (CWWW), now the United Christian Women’s Ministries (UCWM) was established upon the recommendation of Sis. Maria Williams. Jones made his first trip to Los Angeles in 1915 to conduct a revival for Bishop William A. Washington and helped him organize and incorporate the Bethel Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A.\n\nIn 1915, Elder Charles Mason, who became Bishop Charles Mason, incorporated the Church of God in Christ which he founded. Conflicts caused the holiness movement to separate into many denominations. It was first called 'the movement', and later Church of God, Church of Christ, Church of God in Christ, and Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A.\n\nIn 1916, Bishop Jones wife Fannie Brown died in Little Rock, Arkansas. He moved to Los Angeles in 1917 and organized Christ Temple Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A. in an upstairs hall at Washington and Central. Jones married Pearl E. Reed on January 4, 1918, to this union three sons were born, Charles Price Jones Jr., Vance Reed Jones and Samuel Sherman Jones. In 1921, the first property bought for Christ Temple was on 37th and Naomi. Then in 1926, a church and parsonage was purchased for $18,000 on the corner of 54th and Hooper.\n\nIn 1922 the church created a council of Bishops in the national convocation and he was chosen to be the first Senior Bishop. He actively maintained the spiritual leadership and operated as Senior Bishop of the church until he fell ill in 1943 and underwent major surgery. Because of his declining health, he attended his last convention in 1944 in Chicago, Illinois, where he was elected Senior Bishop and President Emeritus of the National Convention for life. Jones died in Los Angeles on January 19, 1949: his homegoing service was held at Christ Temple Church (54th and Hooper) on January 25, 1949, at 1:00pm. He is buried with his wife Pearl, who died on August 13, 1972, at Evergreen Cemetery, Los Angeles. He was succeeded by Bishop Major Rudd Conic who in 1967 relocated Christ Temple Church to its current location on 54th and 10th Ave.\n\n"}

The place, got its popular name, Crank's Ridge, ever since Timothy Leary streaked on the ridge in the 1960s, when it became part of the Hippie trail, during the peak of hippie movement.\n\nThe ridge became a haunt for bohemian artists, writers and spiritual seekers in the 1920s and 1930s, including notable western Tibetan Buddhists, W. Y. Evans-Wentz, and Lama Anagarika Govinda, who in turn was visited by Anandamayi Ma and Neem Karoli Baba. Other early people connected to Crank's Ridge were Earl Brewster, an American artist and his wife Achsah Barlow Brewster, author John Blofeld and Danish mystic Alfred Sorensen. In 1934, Alfred Sorensen who was earlier introduced to Nehru by Tagore, visited the home of Nehru's sister and brother-in-law at their house Khali, Binsar where he stayed and used his horticultural skills in the garden, while still travelling during the summer. It was while staying with the Nehru family that one of their friends offered Sorensen a piece of land where he could live on Crank's Ridge, near Almora.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, luminaries of the counter-culture, including Bob Dylan and Cat Stevens made pilgrimages to the ridge to visit these established inhabitants. In 1962, Allen Ginsberg came with Peter Orlovsky, Gary Snyder and Joanne Kyger to visit Lama Govinda. Ginsberg commented in a letter to John Kelley that \"Rishikesh and Almora were not unlike the Catskills readily accessible, only more spiritual.\" In late 1964, Ralph Metzner visited Lama Govinda on the ridge and was later joined by Timothy Leary on honeymoon with his wife Nena von Schlebrügge. The marriage did not last long. Leary wrote much of \"Psychedelic Prayers\", a psychedelic version the Tao Te Ching composed from nine English translations of the book, on the ridge. Later in the decade Richard Alpert (Ram Dass), visited the ridge as a part of his own pilgrimage. Scottish psychiatrist, R. D. Laing spent some time there in the early 1970s; as did Robert Thurman, the Buddhist scholar, who spent six months with his wife Nena von Schlebrügge and family, including their 3-year-old daughter Uma Thurman, studying with Lama Govinda as a part of his doctoral dissertation over the summer of 1971. Lama Govinda's ashram was visited by many other spiritual seekers. Physician Karl-Heinz Gottmann, composer Peter Michael Hamel and the philosopher Volker Zotz visited his ashram. In the mid-seventies Alfred 'Sunyata' Sorensen was taken to San Francisco by the Alan Watts society.\n\nThe village of Kasar Devi has now become a cult destination, many incognito celebs visit frequently and it also has a small community of backpackers. Participants of the hippie movement settled there ever since the place gained the reputation of being a \"Power Centre\" during the 1960s counter-culture. This reputation is due to the alleged gap in the Van Allen Belt above the ridge, a perception arguably strengthened by the free and easy availability of hemp on the slopes.\n\nThere is also a Buddhist meditation center on the ridge. This Center is in a Buddhist Ashram (Bodh Ashram), originally the estate of Evans-Wentz, then of Lama Anagarika Govinda, then of a Tibetan-Ladakhi family. The Center is affiliated to the Drikung Kagyu order of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n\n"}

Galaxies can appear faint because they are small or because they are far away. Neither explanation, nor any combination, initially matched the observations. The distribution of these galaxies has since been found to be consistent with cosmic inflation, measurements of the cosmic microwave background, and a nonzero cosmological constant, that is, with the existence of the now-accepted dark energy. It thus serves as a confirmation of supernova observations requiring dark energy.\n\nA second problem arose in 1988, with even deeper observations showing a much greater excess of faint galaxies. These are now interpreted as dwarf galaxies experiencing large bursts of stellar formation, resulting in blue light from young, massive stars. Thus F.B.G.s are extremely bright for their size and distance.\n\nMost F.B.G.s appear between red-shift 0.5 and 2.

The school was founded in 1647 by Queen Kristina and is the largest in Gothenburg. It was originally called \"\"Göteborgs gymnasium\"\" and later known as \"\"Göteborgs högre latinläroverk\"\" before being named after its benefactress, the Norwegian-Swedish noblewoman Margareta Hvitfeldt (1608–1683), who left the larger part of her estate to the school. Hvitfeldtska has a sister school in Nairobi, Kenya: Eutychus Academy.\n\nIt is typically attended by students aged 15–19 coming from all over Gothenburg, and occasionally from other Swedish regions. International student enrolment is small but significant. Because of admitting students from lower all the way through upper class, there is a high socioeconomic diversity within its student population.\n\nThe school runs a variety of student clubs. It serves as one of the limited number of exam centres in Sweden for the SAT, ACT, and Oxbridge admission tests. Annually, some Hvitfeldtska students (also called Hvitfeldtare) get accepted to top summer schools and universities worldwide, and represent Sweden in international competitions.\n\nHvitfeldtska Gymnasiet is known for the events that occurred there during the Gothenburg riots of the EU summit of 2001. This did not involve the staff or the students as such, since, in the summer holidays, the school buildings were used for housing the participants of a youth convent.\n\nThe school is divided into three buildings: northern (the main building), western and southern. The library is in the southern building.\n\nHvitfeldtska is divided into four sections: Swedish/national (largest), French, German, and international (second largest). The school offers many Swedish secondary education programmes including \"\"Naturvetenskapsprogrammet\"\" (natural sciences), \"\"Samhällsvetenskapsprogrammet\"\" (social sciences), \"\"Hvitfeldtskas Affärsprogrammet\"\" (business), \"\"Estetiska Programmet\"\" (music), and \"\"Handels- och administrationsprogrammet\"\" (management). Students enrolled in the French and German sections travel twice to, and ultimately earn a diploma enabling them to study in France or Germany respectively; they also take the corresponding language courses. In fact, Hvitfeldtska is Sweden's first CertiLingua-certified school. The international section consists of an English-medium International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) and Pre-IB, which each year have only around 100 and 60 places respectively.\n\nAdditionally, Hvitfeldtska provides Gothenburg's widest range of language courses, study/travel abroad grants, and Individual Alternatives (IAs). IAs are programmes covering counselling, education, vocational internships etc. for students in the Swedish school system who temporarily require additional support. There are also collaborations with Chalmers University of Technology, University of Gothenburg, and other organisations to improve the educational experience for students. Undertaking international exchange study programs and summer internships are also fairly common in the school.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Writing for four of the justices, Rehnquist clarified the Court's holding in \"Argersinger v.

{"id": "2207911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207911", "title": "Kelvin probe force microscope", "text": "Kelvin probe force microscope\n\nKelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), also known as surface potential microscopy, is a noncontact variant of atomic force microscopy (AFM). With KPFM, the work function of surfaces can be observed at atomic or molecular scales. The work function relates to many surface phenomena, including catalytic activity, reconstruction of surfaces, doping and band-bending of semiconductors, charge trapping in dielectrics and corrosion. The map of the work function produced by KPFM gives information about the composition and electronic state of the local structures on the surface of a solid.\n\nKPFM is a scanning probe method where the potential offset between a probe tip and a surface can be measured using the same principle as a macroscopic scanning Kelvin probe. The cantilever in the AFM is a reference electrode that forms a capacitor with the surface, over which it is scanned laterally at a constant separation. The cantilever is not piezoelectrically driven at its mechanical resonance frequency ω as in normal AFM although an alternating current (AC) voltage is applied at this frequency.\n\nWhen there is a direct-current (DC) potential difference between the tip and the surface, the AC+DC voltage offset will cause the cantilever to vibrate. The origin of the force can be understood by considering that the energy of the capacitor formed by the cantilever and the surface is\n\nplus terms at DC. Only the cross-term proportional to the \"V·V\" product is at the resonance frequency ω. The resulting vibration of the cantilever is detected using usual scanned-probe microscopy methods (typically involving a diode laser and a four-quadrant detector). A null circuit is used to drive the DC potential of the tip to a value which minimizes the vibration. A map of this nulling DC potential versus the lateral position coordinate therefore produces an image of the work function of the surface.\n\nA related technique, electrostatic force microscopy (EFM), directly measures the force produced on a charged tip by the electric field emanating from the surface. EFM operates much like magnetic force microscopy in that the frequency shift or amplitude change of the cantilever oscillation is used to detect the electric field. However, EFM is much more sensitive to topographic artifacts than KPFM. Both EFM and KPFM require the use of conductive cantilevers, typically metal-coated silicon or silicon nitride.\n\nThe Kelvin probe force microscope or Kelvin force microscope (KFM) is based on an AFM set-up and the determination of the work function is based on the measurement of the electrostatic forces between the small AFM tip and the sample. The conducting tip and the sample are characterized by (in general) different work functions, which represent the difference between the Fermi level and the vacuum level for each material. If both elements were brought in contact, a net electric current would flow between them until the Fermi levels were aligned. The difference between the work functions is called the contact potential difference and is denoted generally with \"V\". An electrostatic force exists between tip and sample, because of the electric field between them. For the measurement a voltage is applied between tip and sample, consisting of a DC-bias \"V\" and an AC-voltage \"V sin(ωt)\" of frequency \"ω\".\n\nTuning the AC-frequency to the resonant frequency of the AFM cantilever results in an improved sensitivity. The electrostatic force in a capacitor may be found by differentiating the energy function with respect to the separation of the elements and can be written as\n\nwhere \"C\" is the capacitance, \"z\" is the separation, and \"V\" is the voltage, each between tip and surface. Substituting the previous formula for voltage (V) shows that the electrostatic force can be split up into three contributions, as the total electrostatic force \"F\" acting on the tip then has spectral components at the frequencies \"ω\" and \"2ω\".\n\nThe DC component, \"F\", contributes to the topographical signal, the term \"F\" at the characteristic frequency \"ω\" is used to measure the contact potential and the contribution \"F\" can be used for capacitance microscopy.\n\nFor contact potential measurements a lock-in amplifier is used to detect the cantilever oscillation at \"ω\". During the scan \"V\" will be adjusted so that the electrostatic forces between the tip and the sample become zero and thus the response at the frequency ω becomes zero. Since the electrostatic force at \"ω\" depends on \"V − V\", the value of \"V\" that minimizes the \"ω\"-term corresponds to the contact potential. Absolute values of the sample work function can be obtained if the tip is first calibrated against a reference sample of known work function. Apart from this, one can use the normal topographic scan methods at the resonance frequency \"ω\" independently of the above. Thus, in one scan, the topography and the contact potential of the sample are determined simultaneously.\nThis can be done in (at least) two different ways: 1) The topography is captured in AC mode which means that the cantilever is driven by a piezo at its resonant frequency. Simultaneously the AC voltage for the KPFM measurement is applied at a frequency slightly lower than the resonant frequency of the cantilever. In this measurement mode the topography and the contact potential difference are captured at the same time and this mode is often called single-pass. 2) One line of the topography is captured either in contact or AC mode and is stored internally. Then, this line is scanned again, while the cantilever remains on a defined distance to the sample without a mechanically driven oscillation but the AC voltage of the KPFM measurement is applied and the contact potential is captured as explained above. It is important to note that the cantilever tip must not be too close to the sample in order to allow good oscillation with applied AC voltage. Therefore, KPFM can be performed simultaneously during AC topography measurements but not during contact topography measurements.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2207939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207939", "title": "Bruriah", "text": "Bruriah\n\nBruriah ( or , also Beruriah) is one of several women quoted as a sage in the Talmud. She was the wife of the Tanna Rabbi Meir and the daughter of Haninah ben Teradion.\n\nBruriah was the daughter of Rabbi Haninah ben Teradion, one of the Ten Martyrs, who was burned to death for his faith, as was Bruriah's mother. She had two known siblings, a brother, Simon ben Haninah, who turned to a life of crime after failing to match Bruriah's success as a teacher, an unnamed sister, who was sold into sexual slavery and later rescued from a Roman brothel by Bruriah's husband, Rabbi Meir. \n\nShe is greatly admired for her breadth of knowledge in matters pertaining to both halachah and aggadah, and is said to have learned from the rabbis 300 halachot on a single cloudy day. Her parents were put to death by the Romans for teaching Torah, but she carried on their legacy. \n\nBruriah was very involved in the halachic discussions of her time, and even challenges her father on a matter of ritual purity. Her comments there are praised by Judah ben Bava. In another instance, Rabbi Joshua praises her intervention in a debate between Rabbi Tarfon and the sages, saying \"Bruriah has spoken correctly\".\n\nShe was also renowned for her sharp wit and often caustic jibes. The Talmud relates that she once chastised Jose the Galilean, when he asked her \"By which way do we go to Lod?\" claiming that he could have instead said \"By which to Lod?\" (two Hebrew words rather than four), and thereby kept the Talmudic injunction not to speak to women unnecessarily. \n\nIt is told that Bruriah taught her husband, Rabbi Meir, to pray for the repentance of the wicked, rather than for their destruction. According to the story, she once found Rabbi Meir praying that violent men in their neighborhood would die. Appalled by this, she responded to him by explaining the verse \"Let the sinners be consumed from the earth, and the wicked shall be no more\", that the verse actually states: \"Let sin be consumed from the earth,\" with the result that \"the wicked shall be no more\" because they have repented. Another interpretation of the passage, one that fits with the Masoretic vocalization, suggests that Bruriah explained that the verse does not refer to \"those who sin\" (as a participle), but habitual \"sinners\" (as an agent noun).\n\nShe is described as having enormous inner strength. The Midrash on the Book of Proverbs tells that her two sons died suddenly on the Sabbath, but she hid the fact from her husband until she could tell him in a way that would comfort him. In response, Rabbi Meir quoted the verse, \"A woman of valour, who can find?\"\n\nThe Talmud mentions that, in the middle of his life, Rabbi Meir fled to Babylonia, and mentions two possible motivations. The second of these is \"the Bruriah incident\" (מעשה דברוריא), a phrase which is not explained.\n\nVarious post-Talmudic commentaries offer explanations of this incident. According to Rashi, Bruriah made light of the Talmudic assertion that women are \"light-minded\". To vindicate the Talmudic maxim, Rabbi Meir sent one of his students to seduce her. Though she initially resisted the student's advances, she eventually acceded to them. When she realized what she had done, she committed suicide out of shame. (Other sources have it that she fell ill emotionally due to shame, and a group of rabbis prayed for her death and peace.) Rabbi Meir, in turn, exiled himself from Israel out of shame and fled to Babylonia.\n\nThis explanation has no recorded source earlier than Rashi, who lived 900 years after the time of Bruriah. It is also surprising in that it attributes serious crimes not only to Bruriah and Rabbi Meir's student (who allegedly committed adultery), but to Rabbi Meir himself (who encouraged them to commit adultery). Traditional rabbis such as Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, as well as academic scholars such as Eitam Henkin, have argued that this story was not written by Rashi, but rather inserted later into his commentary by a mistaken student.\n\nNissim ben Jacob of Kairouan provides a different explanation that is closer to the text. According to him, Rabbi Meir and Bruriah had to flee to Babylonia after the Roman Empire executed her father, sold her mother into slavery and her sister into sexual slavery at a brothel (to be rescued by Rabbi Meir) and were looking for her. Other rabbinic sources also take issue with Rashi's commentary, and indeed, there exists a tradition among Orthodox rabbis to name their daughters Bruriah, as an assertion of her righteousness.\n\nThe commentators explain that she was really able to overcome that test but God punished her for speaking badly of the sages, saying that if she had said the rabbis are correct, but that she was an exception, there would have been no problems. The commentators also posit that there was no actual sin committed because the student was sterile; those that say there was an act of sexual intercourse hold that Rabbi Meir pretended to be his own student. (It is Rashi who puts forth this idea; he had only daughters and they were all scholarly. Some say they even assisted him in writing his commentary.)\n\nSeveral modern Jewish schools for women have been named after Bruriah:\n"}

Created in 1992, it was the first short line railway in Canada to be purchased from a class I railway, in this case Canadian National Railway (CN). It took over operation of further CN trackage in 1998. As of 2004, the railway has 44 employees. It is headquartered in Stratford, Ontario, and owned by short-line railroad holding company Genesee & Wyoming.\n\nThe Goderich–Exeter Railway was created in 1992 by its owner, RailTex (subsequently purchased by RailAmerica in 2000, and Genesee & Wyoming in late 2012), to operate over Canadian National Railway's Goderich Subdivision, of track between Stratford and Goderich, Ontario that was acquired from CN. The railway started operation on April 3, 1992. On November 15, 1998, the Goderich–Exeter Railway took over operation of CN's Guelph Subdivision, which runs over between Silver Junction (in Georgetown) and London, Ontario.\n\nThe railway had expressed an interest in acquiring the former CN branchline from Stratford to Owen Sound, but was unable to do so as a result of changes to Ontario labour law which made the acquisition uneconomic.\n\nThe railway handles around 25,000 carloads of freight annually, consisting mainly of automobile parts, salt and fertilizer, wheat, grains, soy meal and rice. The railroad serves many cities and towns in southwestern Ontario, including Cambridge, Kitchener, Guelph Waterloo, Elmira, Stratford, St. Mary's, New Hamburg, Thorndale, Shakespeare. From Stratford the line serves the east west corridor of Huron and Perth Counties serving Mitchell, Dublin, Seaforth, Clinton, and Goderich. There is also a spur line running south from Clinton, serving, Brucefield, Hensall, Exeter, and Centralia.\n\nThe spur line to Elmira serves a Uniroyal plant. Traffic on the Goderich Subdivision mainly consists of salt from the Sifto Canada salt mines in Goderich, and construction equipment produced by a Volvo Motor Graders plant in Goderich (closed 2010). It also connects with the port facility at the Port of Goderich.\n\nThe Goderich–Exeter Railway interchanges with CN in Stratford yard.\n\nAs of 2017, the railway owns 13 locomotives, which were acquired used. Its first four locomotives, purchased between 1992 and 1994, were given names of Shakespearean characters (#177 was named \"Titania\", #178 \"Paulina\", #179 \"Portia\", and #180 \"Falstaff\"), as Stratford is the home of the Canadian Shakespearean Festival. Unit #'s 178, 179, and 180 have since been sold to other railways. GEXR was acquired by Genesee & Wyoming Inc in 2012. The railway also leases a few locomotives. All of its locomotives were made by General Motors Electro-Motive Division and include EMD GP38s, EMD GP35s, EMD GP40s, and EMD SD40-2s.

{"id": "2207955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2207955", "title": "Zemfira", "text": "Zemfira\n\nZemfira, born Zemfira Talgatovna Ramazanova (, , ; born 26 August 1976 in Ufa, Bashkortostan) is a Russian rock musician. She has been performing since 1998 and has been popular in Russia and other former Soviet republics. To date Zemfira has sold over 3 million records.\n\nAn ethnic Volga Tatar and Bashkir, she was born in a typical middle-class family – her mother is a doctor, and her father a history teacher. At the age of 4, Zemfira became interested in music, entering a music school the following year (where she studied piano performance and voice) and writing her first song when she was seven years old. Her older brother Ramil introduced her to rock music, which became her real passion – she listened to Black Sabbath, Nazareth and Queen, learning to play the guitar. In the 7th grade, Zemfira split her time between music and basketball, becoming the captain of the Russian Girls’ Junior Basketball Team by 1990. She began to lose interest in classical music, preferring instead to hang out with friends in the streets of Ufa and covering songs by Russian rock groups such as Kino, Nautilus Pompilius and Aquarium (who reached the peak of their popularity in the early 1990s).\n\nAt the urging of her mother, Zemfira continued with piano studies and graduated music school with honors. In her last year of high school, basketball competed with school work, and the singer abandoned the sport in favour of music. She took the entrance exams for the Ufa College of Fine Arts and was admitted into the second year, studying vocal performance. During college, she performed jazz and rock and roll standards in various local bars and restaurants accompanied by her friend, saxophone player Vlad Kolchin. She graduated with honors, and in 1996 took a job as a sound engineer at the Ufa subsidiary of the radio station \"Europe Plus\".\n\nFor the next couple of years Zemfira spent her days making advertisement recordings at the station and her nights on a computer, where she recorded the songs that would later become the singles \"Why\" (Почему), \"Snow\" (Снег), and \"Weatherman\" (Синоптик). In early 1998, Zemfira invited Rinat Akhmadiyev, Sergei Sozinov, Sergei Mirolyubov, and Vadim Solovyov to join Zemfira. Their first professional gig took place on 19 June 1999 as part of a festival celebrating the anniversary of a local radio station Silver Rain Ufa. Shortly after Zemfira sent out promo tapes to multiple Moscow producers, one of whom (Ilya Lagutenko from Mumiy Troll) was smitten with the material, and invited the band for some sessions in Moscow.\n\nRecording and production work on the debut album took place at Mosfilm Moscow until 10 May 1999, when the debut was finally released. The promotion of \"Zemfira\" prior to the release included heavy rotation of singles \"AIDS\" (СПИД), \"Arrivederci\" (Aриведерчи), and \"Rockets\" (Ракеты) as well as the video clips for those songs. The band immediately went on tour, starting a tradition of celebrating their beginnings with a summer concert in Ufa while recording their second album \"Forgive Me My Love\" (Прости Меня Моя Любовь). The group enjoyed popularity from the start, in part because of heavy rotation on radio and television, and in part because a female rocker is a fairly rare and unusual concept for the Russian music scene (which to this day is dominated by scantily-clad female pop singers).\n\nAfter the release of \"PMML\" (Russian abbreviation for \"Forgive Me My Love\") in March 2000, what can only be described as “Zemfiromania” swept the country. \"Searching\" (Искала) and \"Ripe\" (Созрела) became instant hits, and the group was invited to headline the festival Maxidrom. Constant touring wore down on the band, and after the release of \"14 Weeks of Silence\" the band took a break.\n\nIn September 2004, Zemfira began studies towards a degree in Philosophy at Moscow State University, but after the first semester she took a sabbatical and did not resume her studies thereafter. On 16 October on the MTV Russia Awards show the singer performed \"We Are the Champions\" together with the rock group Queen.\n\nThe fourth studio album, \"Vendetta\", which consists of 15 tracks, was released on 1 March 2005. The recording became a result of Zemfira's collaboration with several musicians: , , Vlad Kreymer, Yuri Tsaler and Oleg Pungin. Primarily the album was going to be named \"Oil\", but the title was changed few days before the official release. \"Vendetta\" got many positive reviews,\n\nOn 14 February 2007, a collection of music videos \"Zemfira.DVD\" was released. It contains all the singer's clips, except \"AIDS\" and \"Traffic.\"\n\nIn May and June 2007, Zemfira embarked on a short concert tour titled 'Déjà Vu', with performances held in smaller venues (clubs and small theatres). The tour culminated with a Moscow performance at the Green Theatre which was filmed by Renata Litvinova. The tour program focused on stylish remakes of the singer's top hits, often reworked in styles such as jazz, ska, bossa nova, and blues. A new album, \"Thank You\" (Спасибо), was released at the beginning of October. It is described by Zemfira herself as 'very positive', in contrast to what she terms the 'restlessness' of \"Vendetta\".\n\nThe concert movie \"Green Theatre in Zemfira\", which mixes Zemfira's monologues with selected songs shot during her live performance at the open air show in Moscow, was released in several Russian digital movie theatres on February 21, 2008. Later it was also released on DVD and Blu-ray.\nThe final concert in support of \"Thank You\" was staged on 1 April 2008 at the Olimpiysky stadium in Moscow; some journalists considered it as the best performance in her career. Later in June Zemfira was awarded an independent prize established by a musical critic Artemy Troitsky. She won in two categories: The Best Performance (for the Olimpiysky show) and The Best Album (\"Thank You\"). The movie-concert \"Green Theatre in Zemfira\" by Litvinova was named the best musical movie of the year.\n\nOn 21 March 2009, an album of b-sides \"Z-Sides\" leaked into the net.\n\nIn June 2010, Zemfira wrote on her official website: \"vacation is over\" and announced a mini-tour in support of a deluxe-edition of her first three albums (\"Zemfira\", \"PMML\" and \"14 Weeks of Silence\"). On August 1 she performed a set of 4 songs on the closing concert of a pop-music contest New Wave. It was her first performance since January 2009. The arrangements of this set were used in the mini-tour in September that included 5 cities: Saint-Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Minsk, Kiev and Moscow. Critics admitted that her old songs became more rhythmic and resembled demo-versions due to the new minimalistic style of arrangements. In October Zemfira took part in two tribute concerts \"20 Years without KINO\" in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg that were dedicated to the memory of Viktor Tsoi. Her gig of four covers on Tsoi's songs was seen by some journalists as the most noticeable performance in the program.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2011, the video version of two Moscow concerts staged in Crocus City Hall and Strelka Institute in September 2010 was broadcast on . The video was directed by Renata Litvinova. Then the singer informed her fans that the release of her sixth album had moved to Fall 2011. The first single was presented on Nashe Radio on 15 April. During the next three months she gave three performances: on May 28 Zemfira took part in the international rock festival Maxidrom along with The Prodigy, Adam Lambert, Korn, Brainstorm and other artists; then she became a Russian headliner of a \"Muz-TV Awards\" ceremony show at Olimpiysky stadium on 3 June; on July 23 Zemfira performed at the Afisha Picnic outdoor festival in Moscow as the Russian headliner of the main stage. During that gig she presented a new song called \"Money\". At her April 2013 concert in Kiev, she was joined by several leading figures of Ukrainian showbusiness on stage, including Svyatoslav Vakarchuk. She offended some audience members by comparing Kiev to Moscow, in that she had to work hard, rather than Odessa and St Petersburg where the crowd do the work.\n\nIn July 2015, Zemfira unfurled Ukraine's national flag at a concert in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, drawing criticism from Russian media, while several promoters in Russia abandoned their plans to include her in their programs. However, in 2016, in a concert in Lithuania, Zemfira demanded the audience to remove a huge Ukrainian flag that was unfolded by fans. She said, \"I'm Russian, we're in Lithuania. I'm asking you, get rid of that flag. Whilst you love your country, I love mine.\"\n\nIn February 2016 during her \"Little Man\" (Маленький человек) tour Zemfira announced that she would stop touring, which was misrepresented in the media as her abandoning musical performance altogether. Musical critic Troitsky commented that while he does not doubt that the announcement was made in earnest, he believed that since Zemfira is an emotional person, she may change her decision later. the \"Little Man\" tour continues in North America.\n\n\n\n\nMTV Europe Music Awards\n\n"}

It is affiliated with the United Methodist Church.\n\nPfeiffer originated from a home school operated by Miss Emily Prudden in the late 19th century. The school first began operation on the outskirts of Hudson, North Carolina, on Lick Mountain in Caldwell County, North Carolina. University archivist Jonathan Hutchinson said in 2013, \"Our accepted founding date is 1885,\" referring to the date Prudden's first school began, \"but Emily probably started the school in about 1898.\" The school was called Oberlin, after John Frederick Oberlin, a French priest noted for his social improvement in the Alsace Region of France. The school was later endowed by Mrs. Mary P. Mitchell, and the name was changed to the Mitchell School.\n\nA fire destroyed the school in 1907 and it moved to the nearby town of Lenoir, North Carolina. As that location proved inadequate, the school again relocated in 1910, this time to its current location in Misenheimer. The Mitchell School began awarding high school diplomas in 1913. In 1928 the school began offering junior college classes and was accredited as such in 1934. It was that year that the Pfeiffer family of New York City gave generous financial gifts to the school for construction of new buildings, and it was then that the name Pfeiffer Junior College was used.\n\nDuring the 1950s the school began offering senior college courses. The four-year Pfeiffer College was accredited in 1960 during the administration of Dr. J. Lem Stokes II, President.\n\nPfeiffer opened a satellite campus in Charlotte, approximately forty miles away, in 1977. The campus moved to a new location in 2017.\n\nIn 1996 the college's trustees voted to re-organize to achieve university status, and the current name of Pfeiffer University was adopted.\n\nAn outdoor drama entitled \"The Legacy of Lick Mountain\" relates the beginning of the school, and was presented in Hudson, N.C. in the summer of 2015.\n\nThe Pfeiffer Junior College Historic District is a national historic district encompassing 14 contributing buildings and 1 contributing structure on the campus of Pfeiffer University. They include Georgian Revival-style brick academic buildings erected between 1923 and 1948. Notable buildings include the Administration Building (1923, remodeled in 1936), Rowe Hall (1935), Merner Hall (1935), Goode Hall (1935), \"Practice Home\" (1941-1942), Cline Hall (1935), President's House (1935), Jane Freeman Hall (1937), Henry Pfeiffer Chapel (1941-1942), Delight and Garfield Merner Center (1941-1942), Washington Hall (1941-1942), Mitchell Gymnasium (1948-1950), and the Campus Gates (1935).\n\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.\n\n\nPfeiffer has 2 graduate campuses and plans for a third. The main graduate campus is located in Charlotte, North Carolina near the SouthPark area. The campus has been in Charlotte since 1996 and currently serves several hundred students. On October 12, 2016, Pfeiffer announced plans to leave its Park Road campus, which it will sell to a developer planning a six-story building with apartments, restaurants, retail and offices. The new location across the street in the Park Seneca building on Mockingbird Lane, with 26,440 square feet on three floors, officially opened October 20, 2017. Pfeiffer's Research Triangle Park campus, located in Morrisville, North Carolina, serves graduate students in Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill and surrounding areas.\n\nIn November 2016, Albemarle City Council approved incentives for a campus in the city several miles south of the main campus. Graduate programs will be located in a new building at the location of the former Stanly County Museum, which relocated to the City Hall Annex. The Albemarle Hotel may be renovated as a result, because students could live there. Groundbreaking took place January 7, 2019.\n\nThe graduate degrees offered include master's degrees in business administration, healthcare administration, education, organizational change and leadership, and marriage & family therapy, some of which are offered online as well.\n\nPfeiffer University's Division of Business is a candidate for accreditation from the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs in May 2017.\n\nPfeiffer University's Marriage and Family Therapy program, Raleigh-Durham campus, is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education.\n\nFor many years (especially the 1970s), Pfeiffer experienced success as a nationally recognized choral program, mostly under the direction of Dr. Richard Brewer. Later, noteworthy instrumental music programs surfaced under the direction of composer Ed Kiefer and Fulbright Jazz Professor *Tom Smith.\n\nIn collaboration with the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT), the Pfeiffer University MFT Program is an accredited MFT Graduate School approved by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE).\n\nPfeiffer's athletic teams are known as the \"Falcons\". They previously competed in the NCAA's Division II as a member of the Conference Carolinas (formerly the Carolinas-Virginia Athletic Conference), but transitioned to Division III and joined the D-III USA South Athletic Conference in 2017. Men's teams include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, tennis and volleyball. Women's sports consist of basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis and volleyball.\n\n\nGray Stone Day School, a charter high school, started in Pfeiffer's Harris Building in 2002 and moved to its own campus in 2011, on land donated by Pfeiffer.\n\n"}

Whiplash released two further albums, \"Cult of One\" and \"Sit, Stand, Kneel, Prey\" before the three Tonys recorded a final album together in 1998, \"Thrashback\".\n\nBassist Tony Bono died in 2002 after suffering a heart attack, at the age of 38.\n\nIn 2009, founding member Tony Portaro and Joe Cangelosi reformed the band, adding bassist Rich Day, and recorded \"Unborn Again\", released in September 2009. Whiplash played many festivals in Europe that year including Wacken Open Air in Germany, Jalometalli festival in Finland and shows in Italy, Norway, Mexico and Colombia.\n\nIn 2010, the band took a limited break due to personal legal reasons. In the start of December 2010, Tony Portaro announced the return of their original drummer, Tony Scaglione, to the band. They recruited New York bassist David DeLong, a Pennsylvania-Dutch native, with music influences from the 80's NY Metal/Hardcore/Punk scene. However, after two weeks, Tony Scaglione announced personal scheduling issues became his priority. With the help of Ben Ward of Orange Goblin and Nathan Perrier of Alabaster Suns, Labrat and Capricorns, Dan \"Loord\" Foord (SikTh) entered into the band.\n\nWhiplash launched their POWER AND PAIN 2011 tour with dates in Greece and Italy in April 2011. Following performances at HELLFEST (France) and Portaro's hometown of Clifton, New Jersey, Whiplash headlined at the San Francisco festival SLAUGHTER BY THE WATER 2. After returning from California, they began writing new material, and held another New Jersey performance before finishing their tour with three shows in Chile. In January 2012, Whiplash headlined thrash metal shows in Philadelphia and New Jersey before embarking on the heavy metal cruise 70000 TONS OF METAL aboard the Royal Caribbean ship Majesty Of The Seas. In March and April, Whiplash performed at shows in the Netherlands, and at the Keep It True Festival in Germany and the SWR Barroselas Metalfest in Portugal.\n\nWhiplash is now focusing on finishing their next record, after returning from Pereira, Colombia, where they headlined at the Convivencia Rock 2012 festival in July 2012. On October 10, 2015, Whiplash announced their reunion with original drummer Tony Scaglione. They have also been working on a new EP, entitled \"Old School American Way\".\n\nIn July 2018, Whiplash signed with Metal Blade Records and is currently working on a new album due for an early 2019 release.\n\nCurrent\n\nTimeline\n\n\n"}

Together with drummer James Kottak, who had joined the group for their 1985 sophomore album, \"Sign of Victory\", Edwards was recruited by guitarist Ronnie Montrose to appear on his 1987 album, \"Mean\". Now based in California, Edwards teamed up with the band Northrup whose members were approached by drummer Carmine Appice to join forces in a new version of King Kobra. The resulting \"King Kobra III\"' album was released in 1988 but Appice's focus was already on Blue Murder by then and King Kobra split up.\n\nWith Northrup not making any progress and a deal with Enigma Records falling apart, Edwards joined former Buster Brown and Montrose bandmate James Kottak, fresh out of Kingdom Come, and Kingdom Come guitarist Rick Steier in a new band called Wild Horses, championed by producer Keith Olsen. However, Edwards would end up leaving the band before their first album after receiving an offer to join Foreigner.\n\nMick Jones, the founding member, lead guitarist, and main songwriter of Foreigner had been at home recovering from having the flu. Jones was in the process of listening to audition tapes of various singers to replace the newly departed Lou Gramm when he came upon a cassette of Johnny Edwards. Upon hearing the demo tape, he jumped out of bed and shouted out, \"This is it!\", referring to Edwards as Jones' choice as Foreigner's new lead singer.\n\nReleased on June 14, 1991, Foreigner's new album, \"Unusual Heat\" had eleven songs in total, and ten of these were the combination of mainstay Mick, Johnny and co-producer, Terry Thomas, who had previously worked with Bad Company's lead vocalist, Brian Howe, on their last three albums as producer and songwriter.\n\nIn addition to providing lead vocals, Edwards was also an accomplished guitarist who not only played rhythm guitar but also played the lead guitar in the song \"Mountain of Love\", the fifth track on the Unusual Heat album. The \"Billboard\" 200 documented \"Unusual Heat\" at #117 on August 3, 1991. The album's first single, \"Lowdown and Dirty\" was included on the band's Rhino double-CD retrospective, \"Juke Box Heroes\". Edwards was not accepted by Foreigner fans, as he did not sound much like Lou Gramm. \"Unusual Heat\" was a commercial failure, and Gramm returned the following year, immediately ending Edwards' tenure as Foreigner's lead vocalist. In 1992, the reunited Gramm and Foreigner founder Mick Jones released \"The Very Best & Beyond\", a greatest hits collection with three new songs. One of the tracks, \"With Heaven On Our Side\", was co-written by Johnny Edwards. At the time of his departure from Foreigner, Edwards had co-written ten songs with Jones, in anticipation of a follow-up album to \"Unusual Heat\".\n\nAfter leaving Foreigner, Edwards teamed up with former Kingdom Come guitarist Danny Steigerwald, aka Danny Stag, bassist David Seaton, and drummer Jeff Klaven, formerly with Cobra and Krokus, under the name Royal Jelly. The group's eponymous 1994 debut album was produced by Matt Wallace and released on Island Records. Despite its contemporary alternative rock flavor, it sank without a trace.\n\nEdwards mostly retired from playing and recording music in 1995, returning to his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, to raise a family. He later became associated with the telecommunications industry.\n\nIn 2001 an album of Northrup demos recorded in the late 1980s featuring Edwards on lead vocals, was released by Metal Mayhem Music under the name JK Northrup.\n\nIn a 2004 interview Jeff \"JK\" Northrup, Edwards' old bandmate and friend, discussed receiving an offer to record a new rock album with Edwards as vocalist. Edwards declined, choosing to remain outside music. Paul Shortino assumed lead vocals on the project. Edwards still contributed songwriting and co-lead vocals for two tracks on the album \"Afterlife\", issued in 2004 on MTM Music.\n\nEdwards made another guest vocal appearance on JK Northrup's 2007 album, \"Wired In My Skin\" providing lead vocals on the title track.\nEdwards and Northrup also can be heard playing and singing together on two compilation rock albums released by the MelodicRock Records label and website.\n\nEdwards is currently fronting Louisville, KY based rock band Bleu Phonque who released their eponymous debut album in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2208001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2208001", "title": "American Foxhound", "text": "American Foxhound\n\nThe American Foxhound is a breed of dog that is a cousin of the English Foxhound. They are scent hounds, bred to hunt foxes by scent.\n\n In 1650, Robert Brooke sailed from England to Crown Colony in North America with his pack of hunting dogs, which were the root of several strains of American Hounds. Dogs of this bloodline remained in the Brooke family for nearly 300 years. George Washington received French Foxhounds, Grand Bleu de Gascogne, (which look much like an American Bluetick Coonhound) as a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette. Many of the dogs Washington kept were descended from Brooke's, and when crossed with the French hounds, helped to create the present day American Foxhound. The American Foxhound is known to have originated in the states of Maryland and Virginia, and is the state dog of Virginia. Though there has long been a rumor that the new breed was originally used for hunting Indigenous peoples of the Americas, this is not true. The breed was developed by landed gentry purely for the sport of hunting foxes. With the importation (or migration) of the red fox, Irish Foxhounds were added to the lines, to increase speed and stamina in the dog, qualities still prevalent in today's dogs. One quality that the American Foxhound is famous for is its musical bay that can be heard for miles. This is actually one reason why this breed does not do well in city settings. The breed was first recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1886. Today, there are many different strains of American Foxhound, including Walker, Calhoun, Goodman, Trigg, July and Penn-Marydel. Though each strain looks different, they are all recognized as members of the same breed. Most show hounds are Walkers, many of the pack hounds (used with hunting foxes on horseback) are Penn-Marydel and hunters use a variety of strains to suit their hunting style and quarry.\n\nWhile standards call for the American Foxhound to be about tall to the withers, and weigh anywhere between , many of them are larger in structure (especially the show strains), with males standing and females and smaller in weight, typically between . The legs of a Foxhound are long and straight-boned. The foxhound's chest is rather narrow. It has a long muzzle, and a large, domed skull. The ears are wide and low-set. The eyes are hazel or brown, and are large and wide-set.\n\nA close, hard hound coat of medium length, and any color, though the combination of black, white and tan is prevalent. American Foxhounds do tend to shed a good amount of hair, but a weekly brushing will decrease shedding. \n\nThe American Foxhound is taller and rangier than its cousin, the English Foxhound. Also, this breed is known to have a musical bark, called a bay, when it is hunting that can be heard for miles, probably inherited from the Grand Bleu de Gascogne's signature howl. If competing in a dog show, some physical characteristics that judges would look for would be a slightly domed skull, long, large ears, large eyes, straight muzzle, well laid-back shoulders, a moderately long back, fox-like feet, and a slightly curved tail. Though they are traditionally tri-colored (black, white and tan) they can be any color. They are one of the rarest breeds in the American Kennel Club.\n\nThe American Foxhound has a very docile and sweet demeanor. A typical dog is gentle, easygoing, and gets along with children and other animals. However, they may act shy and reserved when around strangers; it's not uncommon for the American Foxhound to act sheepish or timid with unfamiliar surroundings. With any dog breed, the typical manner associated does not explicitly mean the dog will display said traits.\n\nThe American Foxhound is a very active breed with very high energy. With longer legs bred into them, they are a very fast dog. They require a lot of exercise and do best in habitats where they have room to run. If they live in a suburban area such as a neighborhood, they should have a fenced-in yard and be taken on multiple walks daily.\n\nObedience training is essential for this breed due to their independence and natural instinct to follow a scent. A Foxhound who picks up a scent will follow it while ignoring commands; training requires patience and skill because of the breed's independence and occasional stubbornness. Because of its strong hunting instinct, American Foxhounds should not be trusted off-leash. Most scent hounds are bred to give \"voice,\" but the Foxhound does not make a good watchdog.\n\nThis breed is not generally a breed that carries genetic disorders. However they can easily become overweight when overfed. A minor health risk in American Foxhounds is thrombocytopathy, or platelet disease. This comes from poorly functioning blood platelets and can result in excessive bleeding from minor bumps or cuts. The treatment is usually based on the severity of the disease. Owners will often have their American Foxhounds undergo blood tests so that the condition can be caught early on. While dysplasia was largely unknown in Foxhounds, it is beginning to crop up occasionally, along with some eye issues. It is not typical or customary for Foxhound breeders to screen for any hereditary disorders at this time. The breed's lifespan is generally 10–12 years. The American Foxhound is an energetic breed. According to some veterinarians and trainers, it needs plenty of exercise, for example, a fairly long walk followed by a game of fetch.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2208004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2208004", "title": "Semantic differential", "text": "Semantic differential\n\nSemantic differential (SD) is a type of a rating scale designed to measure the connotative meaning of objects, events, and concepts. The connotations are used to derive the attitude towards the given object, event or concept.\n\nCharles E. Osgood's theory of the semantic differential was an application of his more general attempt to measure the semantics or meaning of words, particularly adjectives, and their referent concepts.\nThe respondent is asked to choose where his or her position lies, on a scale between two polar adjectives (for example: \"Adequate-Inadequate\", \"Good-Evil\" or \"Valuable-Worthless\"). Semantic differentials can be used to measure opinions, attitudes and values on a psychometrically controlled scale.\n\nTheoretical underpinnings of Charles E. Osgood's semantic differential have roots in the medieval controversy between the nominalists and realists. Nominalists asserted that only real things are entities and that abstractions from these entities, called universals, are mere words. The realists held that universals have an independent objective existence. Osgood’s theoretical work also bears affinity to linguistics and general semantics and relates to Korzybski's structural differential.\n\nThe development of this instrument provides an interesting insight into the broader area between linguistics and psychology. People have been describing each other since they developed the ability to speak. Most adjectives can also be used as personality descriptors. The occurrence of thousands of adjectives in English is an attestation of the subtleties in descriptions of persons and their behavior available to speakers of English. Roget's Thesaurus is an early attempt to classify most adjectives into categories and was used within this context to reduce the number of adjectives to manageable subsets, suitable for factor analysis.\n\nOsgood and his colleagues performed a factor analysis of large collections of semantic differential scales and found three recurring attitudes that people use to evaluate words and phrases: evaluation, potency, and activity. Evaluation loads highest on the adjective pair 'good-bad'. The 'strong-weak' adjective pair defines the potency factor. Adjective pair 'active-passive' defines the activity factor. These three dimensions of affective meaning were found to be cross-cultural universals in a study of dozens of cultures.\n\nThis factorial structure makes intuitive sense. When our ancestors encountered a person, the initial perception had to be whether that person represents a danger. Is the person good or bad? Next, is the person strong or weak? Our reactions to a person markedly differ if perceived as good and strong, good and weak, bad and weak, or bad and strong. Subsequently, we might extend our initial classification to include cases of persons who actively threaten us or represent only a potential danger, and so on. The evaluation, potency and activity factors thus encompass a detailed descriptive system of personality. Osgood's semantic differential measures these three factors. It contains sets of adjective pairs such as warm-cold, bright-dark, beautiful-ugly, sweet-bitter, fair-unfair, brave-cowardly, meaningful-meaningless.\n\nThe studies of Osgood and his colleagues revealed that the evaluative factor accounted for most of the variance in scalings, and related this to the idea of attitudes.\n\nStudies using the SD found additional universal dimensions. More specifically several researchers reported a factor of \"Typicality\" (that included scales such as “regular-rare”, “typical-exclusive”) or \"Reality\" (“imaginary-real”, “evident-fantastic”, “abstract-concrete”), as well as factors of \"Complexity\" (\"complex-simple\", \"unlimited-limited\", \"mysterious-usual\"), \"Improvement\" or \"Organization\" (\"regular-spasmodic\", \"constant-changeable\", \"organized-disorganized\", \"precise-indefinite\"), Stimulation (\"interesting-boring\", \"trivial-new\").\n\nNobel Prize winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman's doctoral thesis was on the subject of the Semantic Differential.\n\nThe semantic differential is today one of the most widely used scales used in the measurement of attitudes. One of the reasons is the versatility of the items. The bipolar adjective pairs can be used for a wide variety of subjects, and as such the scale is called by some \"the ever ready battery\" of the attitude researcher.\nA specific form of the SD, Projective Semantics method uses only most common and neutral nouns that correspond to the 7 groups (factors) of adjective-scales most consistently found in cross-cultural studies (Evaluation, Potency, Activity as found by Osgood, and Reality, Organization, Complexity, Limitation as found in other studies). In this method, seven groups of bipolar adjective scales corresponded to seven types of nouns so the method was thought to have the object-scale symmetry (OSS) between the scales and nouns for evaluation using these scales. For example, the nouns corresponding to the listed 7 factors would be: Beauty, Power, Motion, Life, Work, Chaos, Law. Beauty was expected to be assessed unequivocally as “very good” on adjectives of Evaluation-related scales, Life as “very real” on Reality-related scales, etc. However, deviations in this symmetric and very basic matrix might show underlying biases of two types: scales-related bias and objects-related bias. This OSS design had meant to increase the sensitivity of the SD method to any semantic biases in responses of people within the same culture and educational background.\n\nFive items (five bipolar pairs of adjectives) have been proven to yield reliable findings, which highly correlate with alternative Likert numerical measures of the same attitude.\n\nOne problem with this scale is that its psychometric properties and level of measurement are disputed. The most general approach is to treat it as an ordinal scale, but it can be argued that the neutral response (i.e. the middle alternative on the scale) serves as an arbitrary zero point, and that the intervals between the scale values can be treated as equal, making it an interval scale.\n\nA detailed presentation on the development of the semantic differential is provided in \"Cross-Cultural Universals of Affective Meaning.\" David R. Heise's \"Surveying Cultures\" provides a contemporary update with special attention to measurement issues when using computerized graphic rating scales.\n\nVerhagen and colleagues introduce a framework for adequate development and usage of the semantic differential. The framework advocates particular attention for collecting the set of relevant bipolar scales, linguistic testing of semantic bipolarity, and establishing semantic differential dimensionality.\n\n\n\n"}

Rosenfeld (born August 12, 1929) is an American newspaper editor who was the editor in charge of local news at \"The Washington Post\" during the Richard Mattingly murder case and the Watergate scandal. He oversaw the newspaper's coverage of Watergate and resisted efforts by the paper's national reporters to take over the story. Though \"Post\" editor-in-chief Benjamin C. Bradlee gets most of the credit, managing editor Howard Simons and Rosenfeld worked most closely with reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on developing the story. Rosenfeld published a memoir including an account of his work at the \"Post\" in 2013.\n\nRosenfeld was born in Berlin but his Jewish family fled Nazi Germany when he was ten. The family settled in The Bronx, New York City and Rosenfeld learned to speak English devoid of a German accent. After graduating from Syracuse University, Rosenfeld was hired as an editor at \"New York Herald-Tribune\". When it ceased publication circa 1967, Rosenfeld went to the \"Post\", originally serving as night foreign editor. \n\nWhen Rosenfeld moved to the Metro desk, Bob Woodward, recently discharged from the United States Navy and with no journalism experience, applied for a job and accepted a two-week trial without pay in August 1970. When the trial was up, Woodward had written seventeen stories, not one of which was deemed publishable. Rosenfeld told Woodward to get some experience elsewhere and come back in a year. Woodward frequently scooped the \"Post\" at his new paper, the \"Montgomery County Sentinel\", in the Washington suburbs, and kept phoning Rosenfeld for a job. Rosenfeld hired him, right after Labor Day 1971. \n\nRosenfeld fought to keep Woodward and Bernstein on the Watergate story at the Metro desk instead of giving it to reporters at the National Desk. As noted by Roger Ebert in the 1976 \"Chicago Sun-Times\": \"The Watergate story started as a local story, not a national one, and it was a continuing thorn in the side of the Post's prestigious national staff as Woodward and Bernstein kept it as their own.\"\n\n\"Washington Post\" publisher Katharine Graham in her memoirs describes him as \"an old-style, tough, picturesque editor, and another real hero of Watergate for us. From the outset, he thought of the story as a very big local one, seeing it as something on which the Post's local staff could distinguish itself. He controlled the story before it regularly made page one of the paper, keeping it going on the front page of the metro section.\" The \"Post\"s attention to detail and strict rules produced, in Rosenfeld words, \"the longest-running newspaper stories with the least amount of errors that I have ever experienced or will ever experience.\"\n\nWoodward and Bernstein in their 1974 account of the Watergate investigation, \"All the President's Men\", wrote Rosenfeld was \"like a football coach. He prods his players . . . pleading, yelling, cajoling.\"\n\nRosenfeld insisted on publishing a story about John F. Kennedy's extramarital affair with Ben Bradlee’s sister-in-law, Mary Pinchot Meyer, then learned he was demoted in the \"Washington Star\".\n\nIn 1978, Rosenfeld moved to Albany, New York and became editor of the \"Times Union\" and the now-defunct \"Knickerbocker News\". He retired in 1996, becoming the \"Times Union\"'s editor-at-large. Rosenfeld writes a weekly column for that paper which is published by other papers in the Hearst chain. He resides in Albany with his wife, Anne Hahn.\n\nIn the 1976 film \"All the President's Men\", Rosenfeld was played by Jack Warden.\n\nIn 2013, Rosenfeld wrote \"From Kristallnacht to Watergate: Memoirs of a Newspaper Man,\" a memoir of his childhood in 1930s Berlin under Nazi rule and his career path from the \"New York Herald-Tribune\" to the \"Washington Post\".\n\n\n"}

In its simplest form, geolocation involves the generation of a set of geographic coordinates and is closely related to the use of positioning systems, but its usefulness is enhanced by the use of these coordinates to determine a meaningful location, such as a street address.\n\nThe word \"geolocation\" also refers to the latitude and longitude coordinates of a particular location. The term and definition have been standardized by real-time locating system standard ISO/IEC 19762-5:2008.\n\nIn the field of animal biology and ecology, the word \"geolocation\" is also used to refer to the process of inferring the location of a tracked animal based, for instance, on the time history of sunlight brightness or the water temperature and depth measured by an instrument attached to the animal. Such instruments are commonly called archival tags (including microchip implants, Pop-up satellite archival tags, and data storage tags) or dataloggers.\n\nFor either geolocating or positioning, the locating engine often uses radio frequency (RF) location methods, for example Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA) for precision. TDOA systems often use mapping displays or other geographic information system. When satellite navigation (such as GPS) signals are unavailable, geolocation applications can use information from cell towers to triangulate the approximate position, a method that is not as accurate as GPS but has greatly improved in recent years. This is in contrast to earlier radiolocation technologies, for example Direction Finding where a line of bearing to a transmitter is achieved as part of the process.\n\nInternet and computer geolocation can be performed by associating a geographic location with the Internet Protocol (IP) address, RFID, hardware embedded article/production number, embedded software number (such as UUID, Exif/IPTC/XMP or modern steganography), invoice, Wi-Fi positioning system, device fingerprint, canvas fingerprinting or device GPS coordinates, or other, perhaps self-disclosed information.\n\nIP address location data can include information such as country, region, city, postal/zip code, latitude, longitude and time zone. Deeper data sets can determine other parameters such as domain name, connection speed, ISP, language, proxies, company name, US DMA/MSA, NAICS codes, and home/business.\n\nAt times geolocation can be more deductive, as with crowdsourcing efforts to determine the position of videos of training camps, combats, and beheadings in Syria by comparing features detected in the video with publicly available map databases such as Google Earth, as practiced by sites such as Bellingcat.\n\nSome standards and name servers include: ISO 3166, FIPS, INSEE, Geonames, IATA and ICAO. For geographic locations in the United States, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Codes are often used. ANSI INCITS 446-2008 is entitled \"Identifying Attributes for Named Physical and Cultural Geographic Features (Except Roads and Highways) of the United States, Its Territories, Outlying Areas, and Freely Associated Areas, and the Waters of the Same to the Limit of the Twelve-Mile Statutory Zone A number of commercial solutions have been proposed:\n\n"}

{"id": "2208074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2208074", "title": "Neurophilosophy", "text": "Neurophilosophy\n\nNeurophilosophy or philosophy of neuroscience is the interdisciplinary study of neuroscience and philosophy that explores the relevance of neuroscientific studies to the arguments traditionally categorized as philosophy of mind. The philosophy of neuroscience attempts to clarify neuroscientific methods and results using the conceptual rigor and methods of philosophy of science.\n\nBelow is a list of specific issues important to philosophy of neuroscience:\n\nMany of the methods and techniques central to neuroscientific discovery rely on assumptions that can limit the interpretation of the data. Philosophers of neuroscience have discussed such assumptions in the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging, dissociation in cognitive neuropsychology, single unit recording, and computational neuroscience. Following are descriptions of many of the current controversies and debates about the methods employed in neuroscience.\n\nMany fMRI studies rely heavily on the assumption of \"localization of function\" (same as functional specialization). Localization of function means that many cognitive functions can be localized to specific brain regions. A good example of functional localization comes from studies of the motor cortex. There seem to be different groups of cells in the motor cortex responsible for controlling different groups of muscles. Many philosophers of neuroscience criticize fMRI for relying too heavily on this assumption. Michael Anderson points out that subtraction method fMRI misses a lot of brain information that is important to the cognitive processes. Subtraction fMRI only shows the differences between the task activation and the control activation, but many of the brain areas activated in the control are obviously important for the task as well.\n\nSome philosophers entirely reject any notion of localization of function and thus believe fMRI studies to be profoundly misguided. These philosophers maintain that brain processing acts holistically, that large sections of the brain are involved in processing most cognitive tasks (see holism in neurology and the modularity section below). One way to understand their objection to the idea of localization of function is the radio repair man thought experiment. In this thought experiment, a radio repair man opens up a radio and rips out a tube. The radio begins whistling loudly and the radio repair man declares that he must have ripped out the anti-whistling tube. There is no anti-whistling tube in the radio and the radio repair man has confounded function with effect. This criticism was originally targeted at the logic used by neuropsychological brain lesion experiments, but the criticism is still applicable to neuroimaging. These considerations are similar to Van Orden's and Paap's criticism of circularity in neuroimaging logic. According to them, neuroimagers assume that their theory of cognitive component parcellation is correct and that these components divide cleanly into feed-forward modules. These assumptions are necessary to justify their inference of brain localization. The logic is circular if the researcher then use the appearance of brain region activation as proof of the correctness of their cognitive theories.\n\nA different problematic methodological assumption within fMRI research is the use of reverse inference A reverse inference is when the activation of a brain region is used to infer the presence of a given cognitive process. Poldrack points out that the strength of this inference depends critically on the likelihood that a given task employs a given cognitive process and the likelihood of that pattern of brain activation given that cognitive process. In other words, the strength of reverse inference is based upon the selectivity of the task used as well as the selectivity of the brain region activation. A 2011 article published in the NY times has been heavily criticized for misusing reverse inference. In the study, participants were shown pictures of their iPhones and the researchers measured activation of the insula. The researchers took insula activation as evidence of feelings of love and concluded that people loved their iPhones. Critics were quick to point out that the insula is not a very selective piece of cortex, and therefore not amenable to reverse inference.\n\nThe Neuropsychologist Max Coltheart took the problems with reverse inference a step further and challenged neuroimagers to give one instance in which neuroimaging had informed psychological theory Coltheart takes the burden of proof to be an instance where the brain imaging data is consistent with one theory but inconsistent with another theory. Roskies maintains that Coltheart's ultra cognitive position makes his challenge unwinnable. Since Coltheart maintains that the implementation of a cognitive state has no bearing on the function of that cognitive state, then it is impossible to find neuroimaging data that will be able to comment on psychological theories in the way Coltheart demands. Neuroimaging data will always be relegated to the lower level of implementation and be unable to selectively determine one or another cognitive theory. In a 2006 article, Richard Henson suggests that forward inference can be used to infer dissociation of function at the psychological level. He suggests that these kinds of inferences can be made when there is crossing activations between two task types in two brain regions and there is no change in activation in a mutual control region.\n\nOne final assumption worth mentioning is the assumption of pure insertion in fMRI. The assumption of pure insertion is the assumption that a single cognitive process can be inserted into another set of cognitive processes without affecting the functioning of the rest. For example, if you wanted to find the reading comprehension area of the brain, you might scan participants while they were presented with a word and while they were presented with a non-word (e.g. \"Floob\"). If you infer that the resulting difference in brain pattern represents the regions of the brain involved in reading comprehension, you have assumed that these changes are not reflective of changes in task difficulty or differential recruitment between tasks. The term pure insertion was coined by Donders as a criticism of reaction time methods.\n\nRecently, researchers have begun using a new functional imaging technique called resting state functional connectivity MRI. Subjects' brains are scanned while the subject sits idly in the scanner. By looking at the natural fluctuations in the bold pattern while the subject is at rest, the researchers can see which brain regions co-vary in activation together. They can use the patterns of covariance to construct maps of functionally linked brain areas. The name \"functional connectivity\" is somewhat misleading since the data only indicates co-variation. Still, this is a powerful method for studying large networks throughout the brain. There are a couple of important methodological issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, there are many different possible brain mappings that could be used to define the brain regions for the network. The results could vary significantly depending on the brain region chosen. Secondly, what mathematical techniques are best about to characterize these brain regions?\n\nThe brain regions of interest are somewhat constrained by the size of the voxels. Rs-fcMRI uses voxels that are few millimeters cubed so the brain regions will have to be defined on a larger scale. Two of the statistical methods that are commonly applied to network analysis can work on the single voxel spatial scale, but graph theory methods are extremely sensitive to the way nodes are defined. Brains regions can be divided according to their cellular architectural, according to their connectivity, or according to physiological measures. Alternatively, you could take a theory neutral approach and randomly divide the cortex into partitions of the size of your choosing. As mentioned earlier, there are several approaches to network analysis once the your brain regions have been defined. Seed based analysis begins with an a priori defined seed region and finds all of the regions that are functionally connected to that region. Wig et al. caution that the resulting network structure will not give any information concerning the inter-connectivity of the identified regions or the relations of those regions to regions other than the seed region. Another approach is to use independent component analysis to create spatio-temporal component maps and the components are sorted by components that carry information of interest and those that are caused by noise. Wigs et al. once again warns that inference of functional brain region communities is difficult under ICA. ICA also has the issue of imposing orthogonality on the data. Graph theory uses a matrix to characterize covariance between regions which is then transformed into a network map. The problem with graph theory analysis is that network mapping is heavily influenced by a priori brain region and connectivity (nodes and edges), thus the researcher is at risk for cherry picking regions and connections according to their own theories. However, graph theory analysis is extremely valuable since it is the only method that gives pair-wise relationships between nodes. ICA has the added advantage of being a fairly principled method. It seems that using both methods will be important in uncovering the network connectivity of the brain. Mumford et al. hoped to avoid these issues and use a principled approach that could determine pair-wise relationships using a statistical technique adopted from analysis of gene co-expression networks.\n\nCognitive Neuropsychology studies brain damaged patients and uses the patterns of selective impairment in order to make inferences on the underlying cognitive structure. Dissociation between cognitive functions is taken to be evidence that these functions are independent. Theorists have identified several key assumptions that are needed to justify these inferences:\n1) \"Functional Modularity\"- the mind is organized into functionally separate cognitive modules.\n2). \"Anatomical Modularity\"- the brain is organized into functionally separate modules. This assumption is very similar to the assumption of functional localization. These assumptions differ from the assumption of functional modularity, because it is possible to have separable cognitive modules that are implemented by diffuse patterns of brain activation.\n3)\"Universality\"- The basic organization of functional and anatomical modularity is the same for all normal humans. This assumption is needed if we are to make any claim about functional organization based on dissociation that extrapolates from the instance of a case study to the population.\n4) \"Transparency\" / \"Subtractivity\"- the mind does not undergo substantial reorganization following brain damage. It is possible to remove one functional module without significantly altering the overall structure of the system. This assumption is necessary in order to justify using brain damaged patients in order to make inferences about the cognitive architecture of healthy people.\n\nThere are three principal types of evidence in cognitive neuropsychology: association, single dissociation and double dissociation. Association inferences observe that certain deficits are likely to co-occur. For example, there are many cases who have deficits in both abstract and concrete word comprehension following brain damage. Association studies are considered the weakest form of evidence, because the results could be accounted for by damage to neighboring brain regions and not damage to a single cognitive system. Single Dissociation inferences observe that one cognitive faculty can be spared while another can be damaged following brain damage. This pattern indicates that a) the two tasks employ different cognitive systems b) the two tasks occupy the same system and the damaged task is downstream from the spared task or c) that the spared task requires fewer cognitive resources than the damaged task. The \"gold standard\" for cognitive neuropsychology is the double dissociation. Double dissociation occurs when brain damage impairs task A in Patient1 but spares task B and brain damage spares task A in Patient 2 but damages task B. It is assumed that one instance of double dissociation is sufficient proof to infer separate cognitive modules in the performance of the tasks.\n\nMany theorists criticize cognitive neuropsychology for its dependence on double dissociations. In one widely cited study, Joula and Plunkett used a model connectionist system to demonstrate that double dissociation behavioral patterns can occur through random lesions of a single module. They created a multilayer connectionist system trained to pronounce words. They repeatedly simulated random destruction of nodes and connections in the system and plotted the resulting performance on a scatter plot. The results showed deficits in irregular noun pronunciation with spared regular verb pronunciation in some cases and deficits in regular verb pronunciation with spared irregular noun pronunciation. These results suggest that a single instance of double dissociation is insufficient to justify inference to multiple systems.\n\nCharter offers a theoretical case in which double dissociation logic can be faulty. If two tasks, task A and task B, use almost all of the same systems but differ by one mutually exclusive module apiece, then the selective lesioning of those two modules would seem to indicate that A and B use different systems. Charter uses the example of someone who is allergic to peanuts but not shrimp and someone who is allergic to shrimp and not peanuts. He argues that double dissociation logic leads one to infer that peanuts and shrimp are digested by different systems. John Dunn offers another objection to double dissociation. He claims that it is easy to demonstrate the existence of a true deficit but difficult to show that another function is truly spared. As more data is accumulated, the value of your results will converge on an effect size of zero, but there will always be a positive value greater than zero that has more statistical power than zero. Therefore, it is impossible to be fully confident that a given double dissociation actually exists.\n\nOn a different note, Alphonso Caramazza has given a principled reason for rejecting the use of group studies in cognitive neuropsychology. Studies of brain damaged patients can either take the form of a single case study, in which an individual's behavior is characterized and used as evidence, or group studies, in which a group of patients displaying the same deficit have their behavior characterized and averaged. In order to justify grouping a set of patient data together, the researcher must know that the group is homogenous, that their behavior is equivalent in every theoretically meaningful way. In brain damaged patients, this can only be accomplished \"a posteriori\" by analyzing the behavior patterns of all the individuals in the group. Thus according to Caramazza, any group study is either the equivalent of a set of single case studies or is theoretically unjustified. Newcombe and Marshall pointed out that there are some cases (they use Geschwind's syndrome as an example) and that group studies might still serve as a useful heuristic in cognitive neuropsychological studies.\n\nIt is commonly understood in neuroscience that information is encoded in the brain by the firing patterns of neurons. Many of the philosophical questions surrounding the neural code are related to questions about representation and computation that are discussed below. There are other methodological questions including whether neurons represent information through an average firing rate or whether there is information represented by the temporal dynamics. There are similar questions about whether neurons represent information individually or as a population.\n\nMany of the philosophical controversies surrounding computational neuroscience involve the role of simulation and modeling as explanation. Carl Craver has been especially vocal about such interpretations. Jones and Love wrote an especially critical article targeted at Bayesian behavioral modeling that did not constrain the modeling parameters by psychological or neurological considerations\nEric Winsberg has written about the role of computer modeling and simulation in science generally, but his characterization is applicable to computational neuroscience.\n\nThe computational theory of mind has been widespread in neuroscience since the cognitive revolution in the 1960s. This section will begin with a historical overview of computational neuroscience and then discuss various competing theories and controversies within the field.\n\nComputational neuroscience began in the 1930s and 1940s with two groups of researchers. The first group consisted of Alan Turing, Alonzo Church and John von Neumann, who were working to develop computing machines and the mathematical underpinnings of computer science. This work culminated in the theoretical development of so-called Turing machines and the Church–Turing thesis, which formalized the mathematics underlying computability theory. The second group consisted of Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts who were working to develop the first artificial neural networks. McCulloch and Pitts were the first to hypothesize that neurons could be used to implement a logical calculus that could explain cognition. They used their toy neurons to develop logic gates that could make computations. However these developments failed to take hold in the psychological sciences and neuroscience until the mid-1950s and 1960s.\nBehaviorism had dominated the psychology until the 1950s when new developments in a variety of fields overturned behaviorist theory in favor of a cognitive theory. From the beginning of the cognitive revolution, computational theory played a major role in theoretical developments. Minsky and McCarthy's work in artificial intelligence, Newell and Simon's computer simulations, and Noam Chomsky's importation of information theory into linguistics were all heavily reliant on computational assumptions. By the early 1960s, Hilary Putnam was arguing in favor of machine functionalism in which the brain instantiated Turing machines. By this point computational theories were firmly fixed in psychology and neuroscience.\nBy the mid-1980s, a group of researchers began using multilayer feed-forward analog neural networks that could be trained to perform a variety of tasks. The work by researchers like Sejnowski, Rosenberg, Rumelhart, and McClelland were labeled as connectionism, and the discipline has continued since then. The connectionist mindset was embraced by Paul and Patricia Churchland who then developed their \"state space semantics\" using concepts from connectionist theory. Connectionism was also condemned by researchers such as Fodor, Pylyshyn, and Pinker. The tension between the connectionists and the classicists is still being debated today.\n\nOne of the reasons that computational theories are appealing is that computers have the ability to manipulate representations to give meaningful output. Digital computers use strings of 1s and 0s in order to represent the content such as this Wikipedia page. Most cognitive scientists posit that our brains use some form of representational code that is carried in the firing patterns of neurons. Computational accounts seem to offer an easy way of explaining how our brains carry and manipulate the perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and actions that make up our everyday experience. While most theorists maintain that representation is an important part of cognition, the exact nature of that representation is highly debated. The two main arguments come from advocates of symbolic representations and advocates of associationist representations.\n\nSymbolic representational accounts have been famously championed by Fodor and Pinker. Symbolic representation means that the objects are represented by symbols and are processed through rule governed manipulations that are sensation to the constitutive structure. The fact that symbolic representation is sensitive to the structure of the representations is a major part of its appeal. Fodor proposed the Language of Thought Hypothesis in which mental representations manipulated in the same way that language is syntactically manipulated in order to produce thought. According to Fodor, the language of thought hypothesis explains the systematicity and productivity seen in both language and thought. \n\nAssociativist representations are most often described with connectionist systems. In connectionist systems, representations are distributed across all the nodes and connection weights of the system and thus are said to be sub symbolic. It is worth noting that a connectionist system is capable of implementing a symbolic system. There are several important aspects of neural nets that suggest that distributed parallel processing provides a better basis for cognitive functions than symbolic processing. Firstly, the inspiration for these systems came from the brain itself indicating biological relevance. Secondly, these systems are capable of storing content addressable memory, which is far more efficient than memory searches in symbolic systems. Thirdly, neural nets are resilient to damage while even minor damage can disable a symbolic system. Lastly, soft constraints and generalization when processing novel stimuli allow nets to behave more flexibly than symbolic systems.\n\nThe Churchlands described representation in a connectionist system in terms of state space. The content of the system is represented by an n-dimensional vector where the n= the number of nodes in the system and the direction of the vector is determined by the activation pattern of the nodes. Fodor rejected this method of representation on the grounds that two different connectionist systems could not have the same content. Further mathematical analysis of connectionist system relieved that connectionist systems that could contain similar content could be mapped graphically to reveal clusters of nodes that were important to representing the content. Unfortunately for the Churchlands, state space vector comparison was not amenable to this type of analysis. Recently, Nicholas Shea has offered his own account for content within connectionist systems that employs the concepts developed through cluster analysis.\n\nComputationalism, a kind of functionalist philosophy of mind, is committed to the position that the brain is some sort of computer, but what does it mean to be a computer? The definition of a computation must be narrow enough so that we limit the number of objects that can be called computers. For example, it might seem problematic to have a definition wide enough to allow stomachs and weather systems to be involved in computations. However, it is also necessary to have a definition broad enough to allow all of the wide varieties of computational systems to compute. For example, if the definition of computation is limited to syntactic manipulation of symbolic representations, then most connectionist systems would not be able to compute. Rick Grush distinguishes between computation as a tool for simulation and computation as a theoretical stance in cognitive neuroscience. For the former, anything that can be computationally modeled counts as computing. In the latter case, the brain is a computing function that is distinct from systems like fluid dynamic systems and the planetary orbits in this regard. The challenge for any computational definition is to keep the two senses distinct.\n\nAlternatively, some theorists choose to accept a narrow or wide definition for theoretical reasons. Pancomputationalism is the position that everything can be said to compute. This view has been criticized by Piccinini on the grounds that such a definition makes computation trivial to the point where it is robbed of its explanatory value.\n\nThe simplest definition of computations is that a system can be said to be computing when a computational description can be mapped onto the physical description. This is an extremely broad definition of computation and it ends up endorsing a form of pancomputationalism. Putnam and Searle, who are often credited with this view, maintain that computation is observer-related. In other words, if you want to view a system as computing then you can say that it is computing. Piccinini points out that, in this view, not only is everything computing, but also everything is computing in an indefinite number of ways. Since it is possible to apply an indefinite number of computational descriptions to a given system, the system ends up computing an indefinite number of tasks.\n\nThe most common view of computation is the semantic account of computation. Semantic approaches use a similar notion of computation as the mapping approaches with the added constraint that the system must manipulate representations with semantic content. Note from the earlier discussion of representation that both the Churchlands' connectionist systems and Fodor's symbolic systems use this notion of computation. In fact, Fodor is famously credited as saying \"No computation without representation\". Computational states can be individuated by an externalized appeal to content in a broad sense (i.e. the object in the external world) or by internalist appeal to the narrow sense content (content defined by the properties of the system). In order to fix the content of the representation, it is often necessary to appeal to the information contained within the system.\nGrush provides a criticism of the semantic account. He points out that appeal to the informational content of a system to demonstrate representation by the system. He uses his coffee cup as an example of a system that contains information, such as the heat conductance of the coffee cup and the time since the coffee was poured, but is too mundane to compute in any robust sense. Semantic computationalists try to escape this criticism by appealing to the evolutionary history of system. This is called the biosemantic account. Grush uses the example of his feet, saying that by this account his feet would not be computing the amount of food he had eaten because their structure had not been evolutionarily selected for that purpose. Grush replies to the appeal to biosemantics with a thought experiment. Imagine that lightning strikes a swamp somewhere and creates an exact copy of you. According to the biosemantic account, this swamp-you would be incapable of computation because there is no evolutionary history with which to justify assigning representational content. The idea that for two physically identical structures one can be said to be computing while the other is not should be disturbing to any physicalist.\n\nThere are also syntactic or structural accounts for computation. These accounts do not need to rely on representation. However, it is possible to use both structure and representation as constrains on computational mapping. Shagrir identifies several philosophers of neuroscience who espouse structural accounts. According to him, Fodor and Pylyshyn require some sort of syntactic constraint on their theory of computation. This is consistent with their rejection of connectionist systems on the grounds of systematicity. He also identifies Piccinini as a structuralist quoting his 2008 paper: \"the generation of output strings of digits from input strings of digits in accordance with a general rule that depends on the properties of the strings and (possibly) on the internal state of the system\". Though Piccinini undoubtedly espouses structuralist views in that paper, he claims that mechanistic accounts of computation avoid reference to either syntax or representation. It is possible that Piccinini thinks that there are differences between syntactic and structural accounts of computation that Shagrir does not respect.\n\nIn his view of mechanistic computation, Piccinini asserts that functional mechanisms process vehicles in a manner sensitive to the differences between different portions of the vehicle, and thus can be said to generically compute. He claims that these vehicles are medium-independent, meaning that the mapping function will be the same regardless of the physical implementation. Computing systems can be differentiated based upon the vehicle structure and the mechanistic perspective can account for errors in computation.\n\nDynamical systems theory presents itself as an alternative to computational explanations of cognition. These theories are staunchly anti-computational and anti-representational. Dynamical systems are defined as systems that change over time in accordance with a mathematical equation. Dynamical systems theory claims that human cognition is a dynamical model in the same sense computationalists claim that the human mind is a computer. A common objection leveled at dynamical systems theory is that dynamical systems are computable and therefore a subset of computationalism. Van Gelder is quick to point out that there is a big difference between being a computer and being computable. Making the definition of computing wide enough to incorporate dynamical models would effectively embrace pancomputationalism.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They fly everywhere, in fields, on field-paths, on rocky hills, even in gardens, always close to the ground and belong to the very commonest butterflies. During the hours of flight they settle with spread wings on blades of grass, blossoms, or clods of earth, while they sleep with closed wings generally hidden under umbels and the inflorescences of grasses.\n\nAlthough one of the \"blues\", both sexes are brown on the uppersides with a band of orange spots at the border of each wing. They can be mistaken for other female blues but the brown argus never has any blue scales at the base of the wings like other female blues often do. It could also be mistaken for the northern brown argus (\"Aricia artaxerxes\") were it not for the fact that their ranges do not overlap in the UK, unlike on continental Europe. The underside has the typical \"blue\" pattern of a greyish/brownish ground colour with black spots outlined in white and a row of orange spots along the border. The pattern of the black spots is the best way to distinguish this species from female common, chalkhill and Adonis blues as they lack the black spot found near the base of the forewing which is present on these three species. This species has seen an expansion in its range in recent years and is widely distributed across south-east England and most of the Midlands with colonies occurring in Wales and as far north as Yorkshire. These northern sites have seen a lot of confusion in recent years with genetic studies looking at various colonies to separate the two \"Aricia\" species. Until a few years ago, these northern colonies were thought to be the northern brown argus and more colonies may yet be found to be misidentified. Like other blues it is common on the chalk downlands of southern England but will also use other habitats such as woodland clearings, coastal grasslands and heathland. It is not closely related to the Scotch argus.\n\nCommon rock-rose (\"Helianthemum nummularium\") is the favoured food plant on calcareous soils. In other habitats dove's-foot cranesbill (\"Geranium molle\") and common stork's-bill (\"Erodium cicutarium\") are used and possibly other \"Geranium\" species as well. Eggs are laid singly on the underside of leaves. The typically slug-like lycid larvae are green with a pale line along each side and always attended by ants. They hibernate as fully-grown larvae and pupate the following spring. There are two broods a year in the southern colonies with adults on the wing in May and June and again in late July till mid-September but further north they are single brooded and fly in June and July.\n\n"}

She founded the Lanvin fashion house and the beauty and perfume company Lanvin Parfums.\n\nJeanne Lanvin was born in Paris on 1 January 1867, the eldest of 11 children of Constantin Lanvin and Sophie Deshayes. She became an apprentice milliner at Madame Félix in Paris at the age of 16 and trained with Suzanne Talbot before becoming a milliner on the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in 1889.\n\nIn 1909, Lanvin joined the \"Syndicat de la Couture\" (), which marked her formal status as a couturière. The clothing Lanvin made for her daughter began to attract the attention of a number of wealthy people who requested copies for their own children. Soon, Lanvin was making dresses for their mothers, and some of the most famous names in Europe were included in the clientele of her new boutique on the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, Paris.\n\nHowever, her most significant expansion was the creation of Lanvin Parfums SA in 1924 and the introduction of her signature fragrance, Arpège, in 1927, inspired by the sound of her daughter Marguerite practicing her scales on the piano. (\"Arpège\" is French for \"arpeggio\".)\n\nIn 1922, Lanvin collaborated with celebrated French designer Armand-Albert Rateau in redesigning her apartment, her homes and her businesses. (The living room, boudoir and bathroom of the apartment was reassembled in 1985 in the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris.) For this domicile, Rateau designed some remarkable 1920–22 furniture in bronze. The pair developed a friendship, and Rateau came aboard Lanvin's empire as manager of Lanvin-Sport, also designing the Lanvin spherical \"La Boule\" perfume \"flacon\" for Arpège (originally produced by the Manufacture Nationale de Sèvres). To this day, Arpège perfume containers are imprinted with Paul Iribe's gold image (rendered in 1907) of Lanvin and her daughter Marguerite. Rateau also managed Lanvin-Décoration (an interior-design department, established 1920) in the main store on the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.\n\nIn 1895, Lanvin married Count Emilio di Pietro, an Italian nobleman, and two years later gave birth to a daughter, Marguerite (also known as Marie-Blanche) (1897–1958). The couple's only child, Marguerite di Pietro became an opera singer, married the Count Jean de Polignac (1888–1943), and became, on the death of her mother, the director of the Lanvin fashion house. Lanvin and di Pietro divorced in 1903. Lanvin's second husband, whom she married in 1907, was Xavier Melet, a journalist at the newspaper \"Les Temps\" and later the French consul in Manchester, England.\n\nLanvin died on 6 July 1946. Her original office is preserved in Lanvin's corporate offices at 16 Rue Boissy d’Anglas in Paris.\n\n\n\n"}

Some card counters have tried to make the general public aware of the use of these systems, in an effort to convince others not to patronize the games. Indeed, MindPlay has been somewhat slow to spread among American casinos, partly because of the cost (which must be weighed against that of card-counters) and partly because of negative reaction by players. On the other hand, there were many problems with the systems and some players were able to exploit them.\n\nIn 2007 Bally stopped supporting MindPlay. The product was plagued by a host of problems, from the cameras not staying calibrated, to the controller boards malfunctioning. These technical problems along with the need for constant software maintenance by Bally staff contributed to the phasing out of this system.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2208096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2208096", "title": "Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry", "text": "Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry\n\nIftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry (; born 12 December 1948) was the 20th Chief Justice of Pakistan, who served over three non-consecutive terms from 29 June 2005 to 11 December 2013.\n\nChaudhry began practice as an advocate of the Sindh High Court in 1976, before shifting to his native Quetta and later serving as Advocate General of Balochistan, Pakistan. He was elected as President of the Balochistan Bar Association, Quetta in 1986 and was elected twice as member of the Bar Council. He was appointed Advocate General of Balochistan in 1989. He also discharged duties as Banking Judge Special Court for Speedy Trials, Judge Customs Appellate Court as well as Company Judge. He was appointed as Chairman of the Balochistan Local Council Election Authority in 1992 and thereafter for a second term in 1998. He ascended as a senior advocate at Supreme Court before taking a government law assignment in Quetta. In 1990, he was appointed as an additional judge at the Balochistan High Court. He was appointed as Chairman Provincial Review Board for the Province of Balochistan on the recommendations of Hon’ble Chief Justice of Pakistan. He was appointed twice as Chairman of Pakistan Red Crescent Society Balochistan by the Government of Balochistan. In 1999 he was nominated as Chief justice of the Balochistan High Court by the President Rafiq Tarar. The same year, he controversially took oath under Chief of Army Staff General Pervez Musharraf, validating the LFO ordnance No. 2002, and ascended to the Supreme Court in 2002. On 30 June 2005, President Musharraf appointed Chaudhry as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.\n\nOn 9 March 2007, Musharraf asked Chaudhry to resign, which he refused to do, and was suspended from office. The resultant civil disorder led to the Lawyers' Movement, which succeeded in the restoration of Chaudhry as Chief Justice on 20 July 2007. However, Musharraf declared a state of emergency in November, arresting Chaudhry as well as suspending 60 other judges from the judiciary. Following the lifting of the emergency in December and the general elections in 2008, the government was routed, and Musharraf resigned under threat of impeachment. Asif Ali Zardari succeeded Musharraf as president, but also postponed Chaudhry's restoration. This led to the Lawyers' Movement culminating in the Long March by Zardari's political rival Sharif, and the restoration of the Chaudhry-led judiciary on 22 March 2009. Chaudhry stepped down on 12 December 2013.\n\nThe movement for Chaudhry's restoration garnered world attention, while his term as Chief Justice witnessed unprecedented judicial activism, including the suo motu notice of controversial privatization of the Pakistan Steel Mills, leading the case of missing persons in Balochistan, arguing and issuing orders against the New Murree project regarding as environmental catastrophe, and ruling the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) as unconstitutional and irrelevant. After proceeding the notice of contempt against the Prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani who forcefully refused to direct a letter to Swiss authorities over President's hidden assets in Swiss Banks, Chaudry retroactively discharged and ousted Gillani and his government on April 26, 2012. He retired on 12 December 2013 as Chief Justice.\n\nChaudhry's legacy is described as having \"repurposed a once supine judiciary as a fiercely independent force\", but he has also been criticized for judicial overreach and allegations of misuse of office.\n\nOn 25 December 2015, Chaudhry announced the formation of the Pakistan Justice Democratic Critic Party headed by himself.\n\nIftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry was born on 12 December 1948 into Rajput family in Quetta, Balochistan Province, Pakistan. His father, Chaudhry Jan Muhammad, was a police constable. Before the independence in 1947 Chaudhry Jan Muhammad was posted from Jalandhar, India to Quetta, Baluchistan. He spent the rest of his life in Quetta, Baluchistan. Chaudhry lived in Quetta before moving to Islamabad, when he was elevated judge of Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2000. Chaudhry has three brothers who are settled abroad and he is the second eldest child of his parents.\n\nIftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry is married to Faiqa Iftikhar and has five children. His two sons are Arsalan Iftikhar Chaudhry and Ahmed Balach Iftikhar. He has three daughters, Ayesha Iftikhar, Ifrah Iftikhar and Palwasha Iftikhar.\n\nRana Sanaullah Khan is a cousin of former Chief Justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry.\n\nChaudry Iftikhar is fluent in Urdu, English, Balochi, Brahui, Punjabi and Pashto.\n\nChaudhry has a Bachelors in Arts and Bachelors in Law (LLB) from the University of Sindh, Jamshoro. He joined the bar in 1974. He was enrolled as an Advocate of the High Court in 1976 and as an Advocate of the Supreme Court in 1985. In 1989 he was appointed Advocate General, Balochistan by Akbar Bugti, the then Chief Minister of Balochistan. He was elevated as Additional Judge, Balochistan High Court on 6 November 1990 until 21 April 1999. On 22 April 1999 he became Chief Justice of the Balochistan High Court. Besides remaining as Judge of the High Court, he discharged duties as Banking Judge, Judge Special Court for Speedy Trials, Judge Customs Appellate Courts and Company Judge. Chaudhry also remained President of High Court Bar Association, Quetta, and was elected twice as a member of the Bar Council. In 1992 he was appointed as Chairman of Balochistan Local Council Election Authority and thereafter for a second term in 1998. He also worked as Chairman of the Provincial Review Board for the province of Balochistan and was twice appointed as Chairman of the Pakistan Red Crescent Society, Balochistan.\n\nOn 4 February 2000 he was nominated as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. On 30 June 2005 he became the Chief Justice of Pakistan. He is said to be the youngest Chief Justice of Pakistan, who will be serving the longest period that any chief justice has ever served in the history of Pakistan's judiciary. At present, Justice Iftikhar is also functioning as Chairman of the Enrollment Committee of Pakistan Bar Council and as Chairman of the Supreme Court Building Committee.\n\nAfter the proclamation of PCO, on 26 January 2000 an order (Oath of Office (Judges) Order, 2000) was issued that required that judiciary take an oath of office under PCO. Four judges, including Chief Justice Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui, refused to take an oath under the PCO, and therefore no longer remained part of the Supreme Court. To fill the positions in the Supreme Court, Musharraf appointed other judges, including Chaudhry. Musharraf's extra-constitutional acts were legitimized by this new Supreme Court, and the new parliament which was elected under Musharraf legitimized everything including this Supreme Court.\n\nOn 9 March 2007, Chaudhry was suspended by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. Chaudhry was summoned to Army House and was asked to resign in the presence of five Army generals, including heads of intelligence services. Chaudhry refused to resign so Musharraf decided to file a presidential reference against Chaudhry for misconduct. Upon Chaudhry's refusal to resign, Musharraf forwarded the case to Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) as per procedure in constitution of Pakistan.\n\nIt was the first time in the 60-year history of the Pakistani Supreme Court that a Chief Justice was suspended. The suspension was made on the grounds of complaints against Chief Justice Chaudhry for violating the norms of judicial propriety, corruption, seeking favours and misbehaving with senior lawyers. He was also accused of interfering in the working of the executive branch. On the other hand, Chaudhry too decided in the first time of the history of Pakistan to challenge Musharraf and his reference in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Musharraf could not swallow this as he had plans to get rid of Chaudhry by sending the reference to SJC. He did not want Chaudhry to remain Chief Justice as he was an independent judge and had blatantly refused to facilitate Musharraf in his plans to get another five-year mandate through the Supreme Court as his predecessors had done. Chaudhry, on sensing that the judges of SJC were doing what was dictated to them by Musharraf, refused to have his case heard in SJC and hence decided to challenge these dubious allegations in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Chaudhry's petition was taken up by the thirteen member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Justice Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday. Chaudhry was represented by five top lawyers of Pakistan, Aitzaz Ahsan, Hamid Khan, Munir A. Malik, Ali Ahmad Kurd and Tariq Mehmood. This panel of lawyers was termed a 'dream team', who fought valiantly for Chaudhry, inside and outside the court.\n\nAfter his suspension, there was unrest in the country with regard to the validity of the allegations against Chaudhry, as well as doubt as to whether Musharraf technically had the power to suspend the Chief Justice under the circumstances. There was a great outpour of public on roads to greet Chaudhry when he traveled to address bar associations. On 4 May 2007, as he headed towards Lahore from the capital Islamabad, masses of the population lined the 250 km-long-highway to greet him. An otherwise four-hour journey took 24 hours. On 5 May 2007, Chaudhry with his counsel and politician friend Atizaz Ahsan reached the Lahore Bar Association in morning a dinner the association was holding in his honour.\n\nOn 20 July 2007, Chaudhry was reinstated to his position as Chief Justice in a ruling by the thirteen-member bench of Pakistan's Supreme Court headed by Justice Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday. His counsel of five lawyers represented him against 16 senior lawyers representing the Federation. The ruling combined 25 constitutional petitions filed by various parties, but referred most of the issues raised by the 24 petitions not filed by Chaudhry himself to lower courts for extended adjudication. All thirteen of the sitting justices agreed that Musharraf's action had been illegal, and ten of the thirteen ordered Chaudhry was to be reinstated and that he \"shall be deemed to be holding the said office and shall always be deemed to have been so holding the same.\"\n\nOn Saturday, 3 November 2007, General Pervez Musharraf, who was the President and Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan at the time, declared a state of emergency and suspended the nation's constitution and parliament at the same time. He locked all the judges up in order to take revenge on them for giving a judgement in Chaudhry's favour. The declaration accused the judges of violating article 209 of the Constitution of 1973. In addition, Musharraf put not only Chaudhry and all the judges under house arrest but also Chaudhry's young children. Chaudhry's youngest son, Balach, required physiotherapy that too was not provided. His daughter had to take her A Level exam at home, held under the supervision of British Council Pakistan.\n\nOn 15 November Geo News reported that Chaudhry had ordered the Islamabad Inspector General of Police to take action against his and his family's house arrest and their possible relocation to Quetta. According to the channel, Chaudhry held the interior secretary, the commissioner, the deputy commissioner and the assistant commissioner responsible for his house arrest. He said he was still the Chief Justice of Pakistan and the official residence was his by right.\n\nJust after general elections in February,\non 24 March 2008, on his first day of premiership the Pakistani PM Yousaf Raza Gillani ordered Chaudhry's release from house arrest.\n\nIn October 2008, Chaudhry visited the Supreme Court building.\n\nThe Lawyers' Movement announced a \"long march\" for the restoration of the judges, especially Chief Justice Iftikhar from 12 to 16 March 2009. The government of Pakistan refused to reinstate the judges and declared section 144 in effect in three of the four provinces of Pakistan thereby forbidding any form of gatherings of the \"long march\". Arrangements were made to block all roads and other means of transport to prevent the lawyers from reaching the federal capital, Islamabad. Workers of the main political parties in opposition and the lawyers' movement as well as other known persons from the civil society were arrested. Despite these efforts, the movement continued under the leadership of Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and was able to break through the blockade in Lahore en route to Islamabad in the night between 15 and 16 March 2009. A few hours later, on the morning of 16 March 2009, the prime minister of Pakistan restored Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry as chief justice of Pakistan through an executive order, after which the opposition agreed to stop the \"long march\".\n\nChaudhry surprised the whole country when he suspended the privatisation of Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM) on the plea of the PSM workers' union. It did not merely embarrass the government but jeopardised the whole privatisation process. Chaudhry, who was heading the bench, observed that the main objectives of the privatisation policy were poverty alleviation and debt retirement, but these were not given due weightage in the mills' privatisation deal. He objected to the fact that the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation took the Privatisation Board's recommended price of Rs 17.20 per share for granted, and consequently, shares were sold at the low rate of Rs 16.81.\n\nSome very important cases were heard in the Supreme Court in 2007. Decisions have been taken in some:\n\n\nJust prior to the holding of the October 2002 general elections a five-member bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which Chaudhry was a member of, dismissed a petition which challenged the promulgation of the Legal Framework Order (LFO) 2002 by President Musharraf. Under the LFO Musharraf announced amendments to the constitution which restored executive powers to the President, including the right to dismiss the National Assembly and appoint governors and service chiefs, and created a National Security Council (NSC). The main controversy started in 2009 after the restoration of all judges. The oath taking of judges on PCO in the past was then declared a crime by the same judges who had taken oaths on PCO in the past.\n\nOn 13 April 2005, in the \"Judgment on 17th Amendment and President's Uniform Case\", Chaudhry was one of five Supreme Court judges who dismissed all petitions challenging President Musharraf's constitutional amendments. In a wide-ranging judgement they declared that the Legal Framework Order (LFO) instituted by General Musharraf after his suspension of the constitution, the 17th amendment which gave this constitutional backing, and the two offices bill which allowed Musharraf to retain his military uniform whilst being President were all legal because the Parliament had approved the amendments.\n\nOn 30 July 2009, a 14-member bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that all the judges who had taken an oath under the Provisional Constitution Order (PCO), were removed from office and were facing the Supreme Judicial Council. Two days later an ordinance signed by President Asif Ali Zardari officially removed all PCO judges from office.\n\nJustice Iftikhar Chaudhry has been criticised by some notable academics, journalists and others for his judicial activism and over-involvement in day-to-day affairs of the government. He is accused of being in alliance with Pakistan Pakistan Muslim League (N), Nawaz Sharif against Pakistan military establishment.\n\nIn the wake of the imposition of emergency rule in Pakistan, on 14 November 2007, the Harvard Law School decided to award its highest honour, the Medal of Freedom, to Justice Chaudhry, following the military crackdown the previous week. He was the first Pakistani to be presented with such honour and the third person in theworld to receive this award, along with Nelson Mandela and Oliver Hill.\n\nChief Justice Chaudhry formally received the Harvard Law School Medal of Freedom during his visit to the United States in November 2008.\nInternational Jurist Award 2012\n\nThe \"National Law Journal\" picked Chaudhry as the lawyer of the year for 2007.\n\nOn 29 May 2012, Chaudhry and Indian Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav were awarded the prestigious International Jurists Award 2012.\n\nChaudhry received the award from Lord Phillips, President of the Supreme Court of the UK, for his \"unique and tremendous contribution in the field of administration of justice and for the tireless and fearless endeavours towards administration of justice in Pakistan against all odds.\"\nHe was also named among the World's 100 Most Influential People 2012\n\nHe attended the 22nd Biennial Congress on the Law of the World, held in Beijing and Shanghai, China in September 2005. He participated in the International Conference and Showcase on Judicial Reforms held in Philippines in November 2005. He also participated in the International Conference and Showcase on Judicial Reforms held in Philippines in November 2005. He visited the United Kingdom in February 2006 in connection with the UK-Pakistan Judicial Protocol on Children Matter.\n\nIftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry worked hard while pursuing his efforts to clear the backlog of cases. He also assumed the additional responsibility of the Human rights cases under his suo moto jurisdiction. He established a separate human rights cell at the Supreme Court that received thousands of human rights complaints from poor victims across the country.\n\nThe Supreme Court headed by Ifitikhar took many steps to make Election Commission of Pakistan more transparent and valuable, e.g. nomination forms, appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and election expenses.\n\nThe Supreme Court observed that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), having the support of 180 million people of the country, was authorised to hold free and fair elections and stop the corrupt people from getting elected in the forthcoming general elections.\n\nChaudhry retired on 13 December 2013 as Chief Justice. Justice Jilani was to succeed Justice Chaudhry as CJP. In his last speech he focused on human rights and the current Supreme Court position regarding cases. He clarified that now the Supreme Court and law and order are more effective.\n\n"}

{"id": "2208115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2208115", "title": "Gutenberg College", "text": "Gutenberg College\n\nGutenberg College is a private, four-year Great Books college in Eugene, Oregon. Founded in 1994, the school currently has 14 students.\n\nThe college \"does not participate in any government-funded financial aid programs.\"\n\nThe college occupies a Jacobean building designed in 1927 by Lawrence, Holford, Allyn and Bean. Originally the University of Oregon's Delta Tau Delta fraternity house, the building became Delta Zeta sorority in 1946 when Delta Tau Delta moved across the street. Then in 1985 McKenzie Study Center occupied the building.\n\nGutenberg College grew out of McKenzie Study Center (MSC), a Christian ministry that has existed in Eugene for 40 years. MSC was founded in 1979 as a ministry to present a biblical worldview to University of Oregon (UO) students; it now serves not only UO students, but the surrounding community. In 1991, after examining prospective curricula and programs, the board of McKenzie Study Center decided a Great Books curriculum would best accomplish their goals of providing a unique and well-rounded education. Gutenberg started in 1994 with four students and graduated its first class in 1998. Gutenberg has grown, but remains small, with an enrollment of less than fifty students.\n\nThe Great Books approach is based on a program developed in the mid-1900s at the University of Chicago by Mortimer Adler, at Rutgers and St James by Stringfellow Barr, et al. This alternative approach to education emphasizes less the vocational skills and specialization of most undergraduate degrees, seeking instead to produce individuals who are well-read, well-reasoned, articulate, and mature. Personal growth rather than vocational training is emphasized and accomplished through studying the most influential works of Western Civilization in every discipline: philosophy, math, science, theology, literature, and art.\n\nThe curriculum centers on the most influential primary texts of Western Civilization, which students study with \"tutors\" in round-table discussions. In addition, the curriculum includes the following: a weekly lecture, classes and practicums in science, art, math, foreign language and the reading of difficult texts (\"microexegesis\"). The curriculum is viewed through a biblical Christian perspective, though the staff and faculty is not associated with any one denomination. Gutenberg offers one degree: a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts.\n\nCoursework includes the following: two years of classical Greek; two years of German; two years of math (ancient and modern); two years of Western Civilization (Great Books readings); two years of Great Conversation (more in-depth Great Books readings), four years of Microexegesis (practicums in reading difficult texts), and several classes and practicums in physics, biology, chemistry, and art.\n\nAll students read the same works over the four-year program. Readings progress through the Great Books chronologically and cycle through the history of Western Civilization twice in the four years of study.\n\nTo promote lively discussion, classes are kept small, usually five to twelve students. A small number of lectures and secondary sources supplement the classic curriculum. At the end of the first two years, students must pass a series of comprehensive exams in order to progress to the last two years. During the senior year, each student writes an extensive thesis dealing with an issue discussed by two classic authors.\n\nGutenberg's curriculum is demonstrative of educational perennialism.\n\nGutenberg is a non-profit corporation authorized by the State of Oregon to offer and confer a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts.\n\nOn November 3, 2009, Gutenberg College was first awarded full accreditation status by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) Accreditation Commission. TRACS is an accrediting organization recognized by the Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. The college is exempt from various federal guidelines concerning discrimination (e.g., Title IX), the investigation of accusations of sexual abuse, and the reporting of on-campus crimes that govern most other accredited colleges due to its refusal to accept federal funding.\n\nOn October 21, 2014, the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) Accreditation Commission awarded Gutenberg College \"Reaffirmation I\" of its Accredited status as a Category II institution. This status is effective for a period of ten years.\n\nGutenberg's students come from a variety of religious and non-religious backgrounds.

{"id": "2208118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2208118", "title": "Structural differential", "text": "Structural differential\n\nThe structural differential is a physical chart or three-dimensional model illustrating the abstracting processes of the human nervous system. In one form, it appears as a pegboard with tags. Created by Alfred Korzybski, and awarded a U.S. patent on May 26, 1925, it is used as a training device in general semantics. The device is intended to show that human \"knowledge\" of, or acquaintance with, anything is partial—not total.\n\nThe structural differential consists of three basic objects. The parabola represents a domain beyond our direct observation, the sub-microscopic, dynamic world of molecules, atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, and so on; a world known to us only inferentially from science. Korzybski described it as an 'event' in the sense of \"an instantaneous cross-section of a process.\" Thus the 'event' or parabola represents the sub-microscopic 'stuff' that, at any given moment, constitutes an apple. In other words, the parabola represents the \"external\" cause of what we experience.\n\nThe disc represents the \"non-verbal\" result of our nervous systems reacting to submicroscopic \"stuff\", e.g., the apple that we see, hold, bite into, all on the non-verbal levels of experience. The disc represents what we \"experience\" of our surroundings versus what our surroundings actually \"are.\"\n\nThe labels [usually seven or eight are linked together in a chain, with the last one attached back to the parabola, but here we see just one] are shaped like suitcase labels, and represent the static world of words, e.g., \"apple\", giving imperfect accounts of dynamic reality. An object called an \"apple\" left in a jar for months becomes a putrid liquid (because of its underlying, dynamic, sub-microscopic structure), but the label \"apple\" does not change. The word \"steak\", at a lower verbal order, may imply \"something to eat\" at a higher verbal order, but in the sub-microscopic domain, a particular steak may be contaminated with poisons created by harmful bacteria that we could see only on microscopic levels. Thus the differential sets up a hierarchy of order, with the submicroscopic domain of dynamic change coming first, the relatively stable universe conveyed non-verbally by our senses coming next, and then the verbal levels. A label is what we attach to a non-verbal experience in order to identify this experience in verbal terms; when we identify an \"apple\", we attribute to this identification various non-verbal experiences.\n\nThe holes in the figures represent the characteristics that exist at each level. The characteristics that are abstracted to the next level are indicated by the attached strings. The strings that don't make it to the next level represent characteristics left out of our abstractions, as do the holes without strings at all. More is left out of our abstractions at each level than was there at the previous level.\n\nThe structural differential was used by Korzybski to demonstrate that human beings abstract from their environments, that these abstractions leave out many characteristics, and that verbal abstractions build on themselves indefinitely, through many orders or levels, represented by seven or eight labels (or less, or more, it is totally arbitrary how many we want to symbolize the higher levels), chained in order. The highest, most reliable abstractions at a date are made by science, he claimed (e.g., science has conveyed the nature and danger of bacteria to us), and that is why he attached the last label back to the parabola. It is science that has told us that the sub-microscopic domain exists, and in general semantics the parabola represents that domain. In general semantics, the \"natural order of evaluation\" proceeds from lower orders of abstraction to higher orders of abstraction, and back again in an endless cycle. In these cycles, we return periodically or eventually to \"silence on the objective levels\" (our ground) before moving on to the higher orders, i.e., before bursting into speech or theory.\n\nThe general semantics discipline was founded by Korzybski, who gained recognition first with the publication of \"Manhood of Humanity\" (1921) and then \"Science and Sanity\" (1933). Some of his ideas were popularized by Stuart Chase in \"The Tyranny of Words\" in 1938, and by Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa, in \"Language in Action\" in 1941 (which later became \"Language in Thought and Action\"). Also influential was the magazine \"ETC: A Review of General Semantics\", founded in 1943. The name of the magazine, \"ETC\", was a play on a fundamental notion of Korzybski's that names or descriptions do not exhaustively convey all of an object's properties (the word \"steak\" does not convey the possibility of harmful bacteria, for instance). We can hardly refrain from describing things altogether, but we can bear in mind that we could append to any name or description the word \"etc.\", to indicate that the label is only a subset of the total set of possibilities. There is always more that can be said about anything. \"ETC\" magazine was founded by Hayakawa, who was a professor at San Francisco State College and member of the U.S. Senate during the Carter administration. His \"Language in Thought and Action\", went through several editions and is concerned in part with the confusion of words with reality. Hayakawa's work coincided with the advent of television broadcasting and contained early warnings against the dangers of mediated reality that television embodied.\n\n\n\n"}

It has been the major supercomputing and modeling and simulation resource for NASA missions in aerodynamics, space exploration, studies in weather patterns and ocean currents, and space shuttle and aircraft design and development for over thirty years.\n\nThe facility currently houses the petascale Pleiades, Aitken, and Electra supercomputers, as well as the terascale Endeavour supercomputer. The systems are based on SGI and HPE architecture with Intel processors. The main building also houses disk and archival tape storage systems with a capacity of over an exabyte of data, the hyperwall visualization system, and one of the largest InfiniBand network fabrics in the world. The NAS Division is part of NASA's Exploration Technology Directorate and operates NASA's High-End Computing Capability (HECC) Project.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, a group of aerospace engineers at Ames Research Center began to look into transferring aerospace research and development from costly and time-consuming wind tunnel testing to simulation-based design and engineering using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models on supercomputers more powerful than those commercially available at the time. This endeavor was later named the Numerical Aerodynamic Simulator (NAS) Project and the first computer was installed at the Central Computing Facility at Ames Research Center in 1984.\n\nGroundbreaking on a state-of-the-art supercomputing facility took place on March 14, 1985 in order to construct a building where CFD experts, computer scientists, visualization specialists, and network and storage engineers could be under one roof in a collaborative environment. In 1986, NAS transitioned into a full-fledged NASA division and in 1987, NAS staff and equipment, including a second supercomputer, a Cray-2 named Navier, were relocated to the new facility, which was dedicated on March 9, 1987.\n\nIn 1995, NAS changed its name to the Numerical Aerospace Simulation Division, and in 2001 to the name it has today.\n\nNAS has been one of the leading innovators in the supercomputing world, developing many tools and processes that became widely used in commercial supercomputing. Some of these firsts include:\nNAS develops and adapts software in order to \"complement and enhance the work performed on its supercomputers, including software for systems support, monitoring systems, security, and scientific visualization,\" and often provides this software to its users through the NASA Open Source Agreement (NOSA).\n\nA few of the important software developments from NAS include:\n\nSince its construction in 1987, the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Facility has housed and operated some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world. Many of these computers include testbed systems built to test new architecture, hardware, or networking set-ups that might be utilized on a larger scale. Peak performance is shown in Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS).\n\nIn 1987, NAS partnered with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the University of California, Berkeley in the Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) project, which sought to create a storage technology that combined multiple disk drive components into one logical unit. Completed in 1992, the RAID project lead to the distributed data storage technology used today.\n\nThe NAS facility currently houses disk mass storage on an SGI parallel DMF cluster with high-availability software consisting of four 32-processor front-end systems, which are connected to the supercomputers and the archival tape storage system. The system has 192 GB of memory per front-end and 7.6 petabytes (PB) of disk cache. Data stored on disk is regularly migrated to the tape archival storage systems at the facility to free up space for other user projects being run on the supercomputers.\n\nIn 1987, NAS developed the first UNIX-based hierarchical mass storage system, named NAStore. It contained two StorageTek 4400 cartridge tape robots, each with a storage capacity of approximately 1.1 terabytes, cutting tape retrieval time from 4 minutes to 15 seconds.\n\nWith the installation of the Pleiades supercomputer in 2008, the StorageTek systems that NAS had been using for 20 years were unable to meet the needs of the greater number of users and increasing file sizes of each project's datasets. In 2009, NAS brought in Spectra Logic T950 robotic tape systems which increased the maximum capacity at the facility to 16 petabytes of space available for users to archive their data from the supercomputers. As of March 2019, the NAS facility increased the total archival storage capacity of the Spectra Logic tape libraries to 1,048 petabytes (or 1 exabyte) with 35% compression. SGI's Data Migration Facility (DMF) and OpenVault manage disk-to-tape data migration and tape-to-disk de-migration for the NAS facility.\n\nAs of March 2019, there is over 110 petabytes of unique data stored in the NAS archival storage system.\n\nIn 1984, NAS purchased 25 SGI IRIS 1000 graphics terminals, the beginning of their long partnership with the Silicon Valley-based company, which made a significant impact on post-processing and visualization of CFD results run on the supercomputers at the facility. Visualization became a key process in the analysis of simulation data run on the supercomputers, allowing engineers and scientists to view their results spatially and in ways that allowed for a greater understanding of the CFD forces at work in their designs.\n\nIn 2002, NAS visualization experts developed a visualization system called the \"hyperwall\" which included 49 linked LCD panels that allowed scientists to view complex datasets on a large, dynamic seven-by-seven screen array. Each screen had its own processing power, allowing each one to display, process, and share datasets so that a single image could be displayed across all screens or configured so that data could be displayed in \"cells\" like a giant visual spreadsheet.\n\nThe second generation \"hyperwall-2\" was developed in 2008 by NAS in partnership with Colfax International and is made up of 128 LCD screens arranged in an 8x16 grid 23 feet wide by 10 feet tall. It is capable of rendering one quarter billion pixels, making it the highest resolution scientific visualization system in the world. It contains 128 nodes, each with two quad-core AMD Opteron (Barcelona) processors and a Nvidia GeForce 480 GTX graphics processing unit (GPU) for a dedicated peak processing power of 128 teraflops across the entire system—100 times more powerful than the original hyperwall. The hyperwall-2 is directly connected to the Pleiades supercomputer's filesystem over an InfiniBand network, which allows the system to read data directly from the filesystem without needing to copy files onto the hyperwall-2's memory.\n\nIn 2014, the hyperwall was upgraded with new hardware: 128 Intel Xeon \"Ivy Bridge\" processors and NVIDIA Geforce 780 Ti GPUs. The upgrade increased the system's peak processing power from 9 teraflops to 57 teraflops, and now has nearly 400 gigabytes of graphics memory.\n\nAn important feature of the hyperwall technology developed at NAS is that it allows for \"concurrent visualization\" of data, which enables scientists and engineers to analyze and interpret data while the calculations are running on the supercomputers. Not only does this show the current state of the calculation for runtime monitoring, steering, and termination, but it also \"allows higher temporal resolution visualization compared to post-processing because I/O and storage space requirements are largely obviated... [and] may show features in a simulation that would otherwise not be visible.\"\n\nThe NAS visualization team developed a configurable concurrent pipeline for use with a massively parallel forecast model run on the Columbia supercomputer in 2005 to help predict the Atlantic hurricane season for the National Hurricane Center. Because of the deadlines to submit each of the forecasts, it was important that the visualization process would not significantly impede the simulation or cause it to fail.\n\n\n"}

Produced in Mexico and shot in English with American actors, \"La Joven\" is Buñuel's second and last American film. It stars Zachary Scott, Bernie Hamilton, and Key Meersman.\n\nThe film deals with issues of racism and rape against a complex portrayal of two men, each of whom shows both good and evil. The film was entered into the 1960 Cannes Film Festival, and has received highly positive reviews since release.\n\nBased on a short story (\"Travelin' Man\") by American author Peter Matthiessen, the film tells the story of Traver, a black jazz musician on the run after a white woman has accused him of rape. Such a charge in the South could lead to his being lynched. After stealing a boat to escape, Traver makes his way to an island inhabited by the beekeeper Miller, and Evalyn, the granddaughter of his recently deceased partner.\n\nWhat follows is a struggle between Traver and Miller over guns, resources and the affections of the young Evalyn, who becomes increasingly fascinated by the clarinet-playing Traver. She is disgusted by Miller's advances toward her each night.\n\nWhile being pursued late at night, Traver (Bernie Hamilton) steals a boat and ends up on an island off the Carolina coast inhabited by Miller (Zachary Scott), who has owned a bee farm with his recently deceased partner Pee Wee. Pee Wee, a drunk whose liver finally quit, has left behind a teenage granddaughter named Evalyn (\"Evvie\", played by Key Meersman), whose age is unknown. Miller is cruel to Evvie until one day he pulls back her wild-child hair and notices that she is quite beautiful. Miller plans to groom the youngster sexually for himself and goes to shore to buy her gifts.\n\nThinking herself alone, Evvie goes about her routine at the apiary, but Traver surprises her and begs her for some honey. He gives her a dime in return. Traver winds up getting a meal back at the cabin, but when he wants to leave with a shotgun and some gas for his boat, Evvie protests. The shotgun discharges during their struggle (inside the house). Traver gives her 20 dollars for the trouble and leaves. He reaches his boat but accidentally shoots a hole in it, forcing him to return to the cabin for repair supplies. Despite this, Traver and Evvie develop trust in one another. Traver spends another night on the island fixing his boat. Evvie wakes up in the middle of the night when a raccoon gets into the coop and kills a chicken. When she opens the window, she hears Traver playing on his clarinet.\n\nMiller returns the next day, but becomes angry when he finds out he's been robbed. He takes a rifle and goes out to find the perpetrator. In the meantime Evvie hides the money by pinning it into her skirt. Traver is at his boat almost ready to leave, but runs away when he sees Miller approaching. Miller comes upon the boat, and shoots enough holes in the hull to sink it. A chase ensues. Traver finds another boat in a river, but Miller sights him as he paddles and fires a shot. Traver splashes into the water, but later emerges unscathed.\n\nMiller returns to the cabin and presents Evvie with a dress and some high heel shoes (here is the film's only Bunuelism, the shoe fetish). He seems to want to make her into a lady, but warns her away from men. Miller has Evvie sit on his lap, and seems bemused by her innocence. \"Don't let anyone hold you like this,\" he warns her. But as he tries to kiss her, she avoids his lips.\n\nAfter Miller later finds the 20-dollar bill, he confronts Evvie with it. When Evvie tries to explain it, Miller insinuates that she got the money in return for sexual favors and sends her to bed. Traver bursts in and holds Miller up. He takes Miller's rifle and returns to his boat, which he does not yet realize is sunk.\n\nThe next day Miller gives Evvie her money back \"for telling the truth.\" He takes a grenade and goes out looking for Traver, whom he finds busy fixing the boat. They have a heated exchange of insults and racial epithets, but reconcile after learning that they both served in the infantry in WWII. Their shared status as veterans appears to mollify Miller's suspicions and he stops using racial slurs against Traver. \n\nMiller and Evvie leave Traver in peace to finish work on his boat, but he returns to the two cabins to keep an eye on the pair while his boat soaks. Miller offers Traver work on the island in exchange for room and board, and uses Traver's presence as a pretext for Evvie to move into his own quarters. He offers Traver the small cabin she and her grandfather used, and makes her move her bed into his. \n\nFor her part, Evvie can't understand why the two men can't be friends. Traver explains why he has the gun: \"It's easy for him to kill me. It's hard for me to kill him.\" By his reckoning, Miller has more power in that dynamic, so Traver holding on to the gun \"makes us almost equal.\" After some coaxing from Evvie, Traver plays his clarinet. That night we see Miller kiss Evvie roughly. The implication is that he forces sex on the underage girl that night.\n\nThe following day, the local preacher, Rev. Fleetwood (Claudio Brook), and another white man named Jackson (Crahan Denton) come to the island to baptize Evvie. The Reverend soon has suspicions about Miller's treatment of Evvie, while Miller finds out about a rape charge against a black clarinet player, whom he concludes is Traver. The two themes of rape and racism intertwine as the tension on the island mounts.\n\n\nRotten Tomatoes reports 100% approval for \"The Young One\", with an average rating of 8.3/10.\n\n"}

On the outskirts of Nuneaton it collects the Sketchley Brook, and then passes alongside the Liberty Way sports stadium. At this point the river splits, with a flood relief channel to the north, and the main channel passing through the Nuneaton town centre. The relief channel re-joins beyond the town at Weddington, where the river then continues in the same north-westerly direction to pass the village of Caldecote, then Mancetter (where it is crossed by Watling Street) and Witherley, before reaching Atherstone where it is joined by the River Sence.\n\nDownstream of the confluence, it reaches Grendon and then flows through Polesworth before passing beneath the M42 motorway.

His wide-ranging baritone is regarded as among the best male voices of country music, and his innovations, such as propelling the country beat from 2/4 to 4/4, known as the \"Ray Price beat\", helped make country music more popular. Some of his well-known recordings include \"Release Me\", \"Crazy Arms\", \"Heartaches by the Number\", \"For the Good Times\", \"Night Life\", and \"You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me\". He was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1996. Price continued to record and tour well into his mid-eighties.\n\nRay Price was born on a farm near the small former community of Peach, near Perryville in Wood County, Texas. He was the son of Walter Clifton Price and Clara Mae Bradley Cimini. His grandfather James M. M. Price was an early settler of the area. Price was three years old when his parents divorced and his mother moved to Dallas, Texas. For the rest of his childhood he split time between Dallas and on the family farm, where his father had remained. Price's mother and step-father were successful fashion designers and wanted him to take up that line of work but it had little appeal to him. Ray Price began singing and playing guitar as a teenager but at first chose a career in veterinary medicine. He was attending North Texas Agricultural College in preparation for that career when his studies were interrupted by America's entry into World War II. Price was drafted in 1944 and served in the United States Marine Corps in the Pacific Theater. He returned to the college after the war, and many years later (1972) was honored as a distinguished alumnus.\n\nAfter the war and college, Price rethought his decision to continue schooling to be a veterinarian; he was considered too small to work with large cattle and horses, the backbone of a Texas veterinarian's practice. While helping around his father's ranch he also began singing at various functions around the Abilene, Texas, area. This eventually led him to begin singing on the radio program \"Hillbilly Circus\" broadcast on Abilene's KRBC in 1948. He joined the \"Big D Jamboree\" on Dallas radio station KRLD (AM) in 1949, and when the show was picked up for broadcast on the CBS radio network soon afterward Price had his first taste of national exposure. It was around this time Ray Price became friends with Lefty Frizzell. The two first met at Beck Recording Studio in Dallas, and Price ended up writing the song \"Give Me More, More, More Of Your Kisses\" for Frizzell's use. A few demos recorded by Price at Beck's caught the attention of Bullet Records in Nashville, Tennessee, and he was signed to his first recording contract. However, his first single released on Bullet, \"Jealous Lies\" failed to become a chart hit.\n\nHe relocated to Nashville in the early 1950s, rooming for a brief time with Hank Williams. When Williams died, Price managed his band, the Drifting Cowboys, and had minor success. He was the first artist to have a success with the song \"Release Me\" (1954), a top five popular music hit for Engelbert Humperdinck in 1967.\n\nIn 1953, Price formed his band, the Cherokee Cowboys. Among its members during the late 1950s and early 1960s were; Roger Miller, Willie Nelson, Darrell McCall, Van Howard, Johnny Paycheck, Johnny Bush, Buddy Emmons, Pete Wade, Jan Kurtis, Shorty Lavender and Buddy Spicher. Miller wrote one of Ray Price's classics in 1958, \"Invitation to the Blues\", and sang harmony on the recording. Additionally, Nelson composed the Ray Price song \"Night Life\".\n\nPrice became one of the stalwarts of 1950s honky tonk music, with hit songs such as \"Talk To Your Heart\" (1952) and \"Release Me\". He later developed the famous \"Ray Price Shuffle,\" a 4/4 arrangement of honky tonk music with a walking bassline, which can be heard on \"Crazy Arms\" (1956) and many of his other recordings from the late 1950s.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Ray experimented increasingly with the so-called Nashville sound, singing slow ballads and utilizing lush arrangements of strings and backing singers. Examples include his 1967 rendition of \"Danny Boy\", and \"For the Good Times\" in 1970 which was Price's first country music chart No. 1 hit since \"The Same Old Me\" in 1959. Written by Kris Kristofferson, the song also scored No. 11 on the popular music chart and featured a mellower Price backed by sophisticated musical sounds, quite in contrast to the honky tonk sounds Price had pioneered two decades before. Price had three more No. 1 country music successes during the 1970s: \"I Won't Mention It Again\", \"She's Got To Be A Saint\", and \"You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me\" (the last of which was a pop hit in Canada, and would gain greater fame a year later when Gladys Knight & the Pips covered it). His final top ten hit was \"Diamonds In The Stars\" in early 1982. Price continued to have songs on the country music chart through 1989. Later, he sang gospel music and recorded such songs as \"Amazing Grace\", \"What A Friend We Have In Jesus\",\n\"Farther Along\" and \"Rock of Ages.\"\n\nRay Price briefly made national news again in 1999 when he was arrested for possession of marijuana. According to Price in a 2008 interview, old friend Willie Nelson—no stranger to marijuana arrests—phoned and told him he'd just earned $5 million in free publicity with the drug bust.\n\nIn 2009, Price made two performances for the Fox News show \"Huckabee\". The first was with the Cherokee Cowboys and host Mike Huckabee, and he performed \"Crazy Arms\" and \"Heartaches By The Number\". Weeks later he performed with the Cherokee Cowboys and Willie Nelson (again with Huckabee playing bass guitar). This time they performed duets of \"Faded Love\" and \"Crazy.\"\n\nPrice worked on his last album, \"Last of the Breed\", with fellow country music singers Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard. This album was released on March 20, 2007, by the company Lost Highway Records. The two-disc set features 20 country classics as well as a pair of new compositions. The trio toured the U.S. from March 9 until March 25 starting in Arizona and finishing in Illinois. This was Price's third album with Nelson and first album with Haggard. After the tour, Haggard remarked, \"I told Willie when it was over, 'That old man gave us a goddamn singing lesson.' He really did. He just sang so good. He sat there with the mic against his chest. And me and Willie are all over the microphone trying to find it, and he found it.\"\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Ray Price confirmed that he was fighting pancreatic cancer. Price told the \"San Antonio Express-News\" that he had been receiving chemotherapy for the past six months. An alternative to the chemo would have been surgery that involved removing the pancreas along with portions of the stomach and liver, which would have meant a long recovery and stay in a nursing home. Said Price, \"That's not very much an option for me. God knows I want to live as long as I can but I don't want to live like that.\" The 87-year-old Country Music Hall of Famer also told the newspaper, \"The doctor said that every man will get cancer if he lives to be old enough. I don't know why I got it – I ain't old!\" Price retained a positive outlook and hoped to play as many as a hundred concert dates in 2013.\n\nAlthough in February 2013 the cancer appeared to be in remission, Price was hospitalized in May 2013 with severe dehydration. On December 2, 2013, Price entered a Tyler, Texas, hospital in the final stages of pancreatic cancer, according to his son, then left on December 12 for home hospice care. Price died at his home in Mt. Pleasant, Texas, on December 16, 2013. Ray Price was interred at Restland Memorial Park in Dallas, Texas.\n\nAfter leaving Nashville, Price lived his time off the road on his east Texas ranch near Mount Pleasant, continuing to dabble in gamefowl, cattle and horses. Ray Price married twice. He and his first wife divorced in the late 1960s. Price married second wife Janie on June 11, 1970, and they remained together until his death. A son from his first marriage, Cliff Price, also survives.\n\nAcademy of Country Music\n\nCountry Music Association\n\nCountry Music Hall of Fame and Museum\n\nGrammy Awards\n\n\n"}

Palani Hills joined with Anamalai Hills and Cardamom Hills at Anamudi peak in Kerala state.\n\nThe lower elevations of the Palani Hills, between 250 and 1,000 m (820-3,281 ft), are part of the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests ecoregion. Above 1,000 m (3,281 ft), the deciduous forests transition to the evergreen South Western Ghats montane rain forests. In the highest portions of the range, above 2,000 m (6,562 ft), the montane rainforests give way to \"shola\"-grassland mosaic, made up of frost-tolerant montane grasslands interspersed with pockets of stunted \"shola\" forests.\n\nThe Palani Hills are currently subject to increasing development pressure. The Palani Hills Conservation Council, a non-governmental organization headquartered in Kodaikanal, was founded in 1985. In the early 1990s the Tamil Nadu Forest Department proposed to the Tamil Nadu state government that much of the range be granted protected status as a wildlife sanctuary or Palani Hills Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park.\n\n"}

The number of Greek contestants is commonly cited as 169, but as many as 176 Greeks contested events in all nine sports. The Greeks were by far the most successful nation in terms of total medals with 46, 26 more than the United States of America. Nevertheless, their number of first-place finishes (10) was one fewer than the Americans' 11. The Greeks had 172 entries in 39 events. Only 4 events had no Greek entrants—the 400 metres and the high jump in athletics and the vault and the team horizontal bar in gymnastics.\n\nThe Greeks entered every event on the athletics program save the 400 metres and the high jump. They took 1 gold, 3 silver, and 6 bronze medals in the sport. It was initially thought that the Greek team had swept the top three places of the marathon event, until it was discovered that Spiridon Belokas had covered part of the distance by cart and was disqualified.\n\n\n\nGreece had entries in all six cycling events, winning one and taking second place in three more.\n\nGreek fencers won the top two places in the sabre competition, third place in the amateur foil competition, and in a major upset, Pyrgos defeated Joanni Perronet in the sole match of the masters foil event.\n\nThe names of the members of the two teams that competed in the team events are, for the most part, unknown. The vault and the team horizontal bar were two of the four events (the other two in the athletics program) that had no Greek entrants. The Greeks took two of each color medal, with two medals in each of the rope climbing (gold and silver), rings (gold and bronze), and team parallel bars (silver and bronze) competitions.\n\nGreek shooters dominated the two rifle events and the rapid fire pistol competition, but were largely unable to compete with the Paine brothers of the United States in the pistol events that the two brothers entered.\n\nSome of the Greek swimmers' names were not recorded. Greece's only swimming gold medal came in an event in which only Greek swimmers were allowed to compete, as did a silver and a bronze. In the three open events, the Greeks took two silvers and two bronzes, all in the two longer races.\n\nGreece earned a silver medal and a bronze medal in the singles tournament. Kasdaglis and Petrokokkinos competed as a mixed team, winning another silver which is not counted in the Greek total.\n\nIn the one handed event, weightlifters had to lift with each hand successively. Nikolopoulos was able to list 57 kilograms with one hand, but only 40 kilograms with the other. He was judged to have come in third place in the event between the silver medallist Viggo Jensen who had lifted 57 with each hand and 4th-place finisher Versis who had lifted 40 with each, but had not been able to lift 57 with either.\n\nLifting form was used to break ties in the two handed competition.\n\nChristopoulos won a battle of endurance against Momcsilló Tapavicza in the quarterfinals of the wrestling tournament. He then had to face Tsitas, who had received a bye in that round. Tsitas won, giving Christopoulos the bronze medal and a shoulder injury. Tsitas then faced Carl Schuhmann in the final. Schuhmann, having had a bye in the semifinals, took two days to defeat Tsitas, the match having to be postponed on account of darkness at the end of 40 minutes in the first day.\n\n"}
