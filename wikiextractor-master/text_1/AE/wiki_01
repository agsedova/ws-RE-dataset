Bengough is best remembered for his political cartoons in \"Grip\", a satirical magazine he published and edited, which he modelled after the British humour magazine \"Punch\". He published some cartoons under the pen name L. Côté.\n\nBorn in Toronto in the Province of Canada to Scottish and Irish immigrants, Bengough grew up in nearby Whitby, where after graduating from high school he began a career in newspapers as a typesetter. The political cartoons of the American Thomas Nast inspired Bengough to direct his drawing talents towards cartooning; a lack of outlets for his work drove him to found \"Grip\" in 1873. The Pacific Scandal gave Bengough ample material to lampoon, and soon Bengough's image of prime minister John A. Macdonald achieved fame across Canada. After \"Grip\" folded in 1894, Bengough published books, contributed cartoons to Canadian and foreign newspapers, and toured giving chalk talks internationally.\n\nBengough was deeply religious and devoted himself to promoting social reforms. He supported free trade, prohibition of alcohol and tobacco, women's suffrage, and other liberal beliefs, but was opposed to Canadian bilingualism. Bengough had ambitions to run for office, though Liberal leader Wilfrid Laurier convinced him against running for Parliament; he served as alderman on the Toronto City Council from 1907 to 1909. The Canadian government listed Bengough as a Person of National Historic Significance in 1938 and he was inducted into the Canadian Cartoonist Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nBengough's grandparents John (d. 5 April 1867), a ship's carpenter, and Johanna ( Jackson, d. 18 March 1859) were born in St Andrews in Scotland in the 1790s and immigrated with their children to Canada at an unknown date; they are known to have been in Whitby on Lake Ontario in the Province of Canada by the 1850s. They brought with them at least three children, including Bengough's father John (23 May 1819 in Scotland – 1899) who became a cabinetmaker. John Bengough was politically active: he advocated social reforms such as the Georgist single tax and had several Town Council appointments, though he never held political office. He used the title Captain, which suggests he may have sometime sailed ships out of Port Whitby.\n\nBengough's father married Margaret Wilson, an Irish immigrant born in Bailieborough in County Cavan, and the couple had six children: five sons and a daughter. John Wilson Bengough was the second, born into the deeply Protestant family on 7 April 1851 in Toronto, where the elder Bengough had run a shop on Victoria Street in the 1840s. It is not known when they moved to Toronto, but it is known that by 1853 the family had moved back to Whitby.\n\nBengough attended Whitby Grammar School, where he was an average student; he won a prize one year for general proficiency, for which he received a book titled \"Boyhood of Great Artists\". He was an avid sketcher, a talent which caught the notice of his teacher, who presented Bengough with a set of paints one Christmas. Bengough credited this act with setting him on the path to a career as an artist. Whitby residents later reminisced of the young Bengough drawing chalk portraits of his neighbours on fences. He described himself as a \"voracious reader\", particularly of the \"Whitby Gazette\", a didactic weekly that stressed Christian values.\n\nAfter graduation, Bengough tried his hand at a number of jobs, including photographer's assistant, and he articled to a lawyer for some time before getting a typesetting job at the \"Whitby Gazette\". The \"Gazette\"s editor was George Ham, an extroverted journalist who later worked as public relations chief for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Bengough contributed short local-interest articles. In mid-1870, Ham issued a four-page daily to capitalize on interest in the Franco-Prussian War and commissioned Bengough to provide a serialized novel for it. The popular reception of \"The Murderer's Scalp\" (or \"The Shrieking Ghost of the Bloody Den\") encouraged Bengough to devote himself to a journalism career. The serial went unfinished because Ham cancelled the daily when the war died down. The papers and magazines that came into the \"Gazette\" offices, in particular \"Harper's Weekly\", introduced Bengough to the growing field of cartooning. Bengough reminisced,\n\nI divided my time between mechanical duties for sordid wages and poetry for the good of humanity, and meanwhile I kept an eye on Thomas Nast the cartoonist.\n\nBengough considered the politically and socially aware Nast a \"beau ideal\" whose \"moral crusade against abject wrong\"—in particular his relentless Boss Tweed cartoons—inspired the young Bengough to \"emulate Nast in the field of Canadian politics\". Bengough so admired the cartoonist that he sent a cartoon to \"Harper's\" of Nast confronting the Tammany Hall political machine, rendered in Nast's style, to which the editor returned a positive response and an acknowledgement from Nast.\n\nAt twenty, Bengough moved to Toronto and became a reporter on politician George Brown's newspaper \"The Globe\". The Liberal paper was the most influential in the country; Bengough's family had supported the Liberal Party since before Confederation, and these connections probably played a role in his getting the position at the paper. Editorial cartooning had no presence in Canadian newspapers at the time and was not to have one until Hugh Graham brought the practice to his \"Montreal Star\" in 1876; Bengough stated he did not consider the possibility of editorial cartooning at the time. The lack of cartooning opportunities disappointed him, and he enrolled briefly in the Ontario School of Art, which he found pedantic and stifling; he quit after one term.\n\nBengough told the following story of how he took up publishing: He had made a caricature of James Beaty, Sr., editor of the conservative \"Toronto Leader\", and Beaty's nephew Sam found it so amusing that he made a lithographic copy for himself at the printer Rolph Bros. Impressed with his first exposure to lithography, and frustrated with the lack of opportunities to have his cartoons published, Bengough asked himself, \"Why not start a weekly comic paper with lithographed cartoons?\" His brother Thomas remembered a somewhat different story in which Bengough first began distributing copies of his cartoons on the street. Of his printed cartoons, only one of Liberal member Edward Blake has survived.\n\nIn 1849–50 John Henry Walker's short-lived weekly \"Punch in Canada\" provided the first regular outlet for Canadian political cartooning; others such as \"The Grumbler\" (1858–69), \"Grinchuckle\" (1869–70), and \"Diogenes\" (1868–70) did not last long, either. George-Édouard Desbarats's more conservative, Montreal-based \"Canadian Illustrated News\" (1869–83) lasted much longer. Bengough was to found the first major humour magazine in English Canada.\n\nA raven character in the Charles Dickens novel \"Barnaby Rudge\" inspired the name of the magazine \"Grip\". Its pages carried political and social commentary along with satirical cartoons, and its debut issue of 24 May 1873 declared: \"\"Grip\" will be entirely independent and impartial, always, and on all subjects.\" Bengough set the editorial policy and was the lead cartoonist.\n\n\"Grip\"s initial financing came from Toronto publisher Andrew Scott Irving. Later in the year Bengough set up an office on 2 Toronto Street and with his four brothers formed the Bengough Brothers company. Bengough continued to work at the \"Globe\" until \"Grip\" established itself. He used pseudonyms until he left the newspaper later in the year. The editor's name appeared as a \"Charles P. Hall\" until Thomas Phillips Thompson took over as editor on 26 July under the pseudonym \"Jimuel Briggs\"; he lasted until the 6 September issue, when he printed a pro-alcohol article despite Bengough's prohibitionist views. The \"Toronto Globe\"s R. H. Larminie then took on co-editing duties as \"Demos Mudge\" with Bengough as \"Barnaby Rudge\". Regular contributors other than Bengough included R. W. Phipps, who produced the greatest amount of \"Grip\"s poetry; Tom Boylan, who Bengough considered \"Grip\"s best humourist; Edward Edwards, who wrote sombre topical articles in contrast to the humour of the rest of the magazine; and William Alexander Foster who wrote scathing editorials about Oliver Mowat's Ontario Liberal Party, which contrasted with Bengough's position and lent credibility to the magazine's assertions of non-partisanship. Writers such as Peter McArthur got their start with \"Grip\".\n\n\"Grip\"s early issues attracted little notice. \"The Hamilton Spectator\" declared it \"dull ... When \"Grip\" dies, which will be soon, Toronto will be much more cheerful. ... \"Grip\" is what \"Punch\" would be with all the spirit left out\". Events arising from the Canadian federal election of 1872 shortly gave Bengough sufficient popular material to lampoon: accusations of bribery and other improprieties involving prime minister John A. Macdonald and business magnate Hugh Allan inflated into the Pacific Scandal, the most closely followed scandal in the young nation's history. Macdonald's features lent themselves to caricature and gave Bengough the chance to proselytize. Circulation rose to about 2,000 copies per issue at the time; Bengough's brother Thomas reported that each new issue was eagerly awaited at the House of Commons. A 23 August 1873 cartoon entitled \"The Beauties of a Royal Commission: When shall we three meet again?\" drew praise from newspapers across Canada, as well as from Liberal MP Lucius Seth Huntington in a speech to the House of Commons.\n\nDespite their Liberal leanings, in 1878 Bengough and \"Grip\" took the side of the proposed Conservative National Policy of high tariffs on trade with the US, against the governing Liberal stance of free trade. The issue contributed to the loss of Alexander Mackenzie's incumbent Liberals to Macdonald's Conservatives in the election of 1878, despite \"Grip\"s prediction that Mackenzie would win again. The magazine supported no party officially in its early years, but made its support for the Liberals explicit in the elections of 1887 and of 1891, after Wilfrid Laurier had become party leader. In the mid-1880s the Grip Printing and Publishing Company took on printing duties for the Ontario Liberal government. This support, however, resulted in no federal election wins.\n\n\"Grip\" had considerable influence on the public perception of politicians. That it was slanted in favour of Liberals and against Conservatives drove Conservative supporters to launch rival publications. The first was \"Jester\", begun in 1878, which featured cartoons by Henri Julien that painted Macdonald in a benevolent light. \"Jester\" failed to find an audience to match Bengough's and folded the following year. In 1886, Bengough reported a weekly circulation for \"Grip\" of 50,000.\n\nIn March 1874, in the music hall of the Toronto Mechanics' Institute, Bengough began giving comic chalk talk performances, which he later toured across the country. He impressed audiences with his ability to capture the likeness of members of the audience in a single penstroke. He continued his chalk talks throughout his life and travelled with them to the US, Australia, New Zealand, and Britain. He published an autobiography titled \"Chalk Talks\" in 1922, the year before his death.\n\nEarly Canadian feminist writer Sarah Anne Curzon made regular contributions to \"Grip\". At Bengough's request in 1882, she wrote the closet drama \"The Sweet Girl Graduate\" for the book \"The Grip Sack\". The drama tells of a woman who disguises herself as a man to attend university at a time when women were barred in Canada from post-secondary education.\n\nIn 1883, Frank Wilson took over management of the printing of \"Grip\". Thomas Phillips Thompson became associate editor. He shared with Bengough a radical political outlook and a taste for satire, though was less open to new ideas than Bengough, who was quick to attach himself to new causes. Thompson was anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist, and anti-militarist. In 1892, the managers of \"Grip\" passed the editorship from Bengough to Thompson and Bengough's cartoons stopped appearing after the 6 August 1892 issue. Years later, Bengough's brother Thomas blamed the board of directors at Grip, Inc., for the falling out over \"general mismanagement\", which may have involved losses incurred in relation to a government contract.\n\n\"Grip\"s tone became increasingly strident: anti-French, anti-Catholic, pro-socialist. This, and an increased use of racial caricature, seem to have alienated readers. Under the new editorship readership fell until \"Grip\" ceased publication in July 1893. Grip, Inc., sold off assets, such as its printing machines, to repay debts.\n\nBengough revived \"Grip\" in 1894 under a new company called Phoenix Publishing with a partner named Bell who had newspaper publishing experience in Belleville. They softened \"Grip\"s tone, but the content appeared rushed and it lasted only from 4 January to 29 December 1894. Macdonald had died in 1891, and Bengough blamed the publication's ill fortunes on the loss of such a target.\n\nAfter \"Grip\" ceased publication, Bengough worked for the next quarter-century as a cartoonist for a variety of newspapers, including \"The Globe\", \"The Toronto Evening Telegram\", the \"Montreal Star\", \"Canadian Geographic\", the American \"The Public\" and \"The Single Tax Review\", \"The Morning Chronicle\" and \"Daily Express\" in England, and \"the Sydney Herald\" in Australia.\n\nBengough continued to devote himself to political causes. He supported the Liberals' successful campaign in the federal election of 1896 with cartoons in the \"Toronto Globe\" and with a song he composed titled \"Ontario, Ontario\". He belonged to numerous political and social clubs. He was a founding member of the Royal Society of Canada in 1880, to which the Governor General appointed him an Associate. He was professor of elocution at Knox College from 1899 to 1901. He served as director of the Toronto Exhibition, auditor for the Canadian Peace and Arbitration Society, member for three years of the board of directors of the Victoria Industrial School, and president of the Toronto Single Tax Association, and took part in the People's Forum social activist group.\n\nIn 1907, Bengough campaigned to join the Toronto City Council as an alderman for Ward 3. Major newspapers such as the \"Toronto Star\" promoted him, and the \"Toronto Daily World\" ran a photograph of him on its front page when he won. He won again in 1908 and 1909. He counted future Toronto mayor Horatio Clarence Hocken amongst his reformist allies on the Council and promoted issues such as public ownership of hydroelectric power, but found little support for his ideas. His successes included legislation restricting the issuing of liquor licenses, which found support when he made it an election issue in his 1909 campaign.\n\nIn March 1909, Bengough took a leave of absence from the Toronto City Council to tour Australia and New Zealand and gave up his post when he returned. When the First World War broke out, he devoted his energies to promoting patriotism and the war effort, and supported conscription, a cause that was popular in English Canada but unpopular in Quebec and which ran counter to the Liberal Party position. Bengough nevertheless continued to support the party and used his cartoons to promote party leader William Lyon Mackenzie King in the federal election of 1921.\n\nFollowing a chalk-talk performance in Moncton, New Brunswick in 1922, Bengough suffered an attack of angina pectoris, attributed to overwork during a previous tour of Western Canada. He died of it on 2 October 1923 at his drawing board at his home on 58 St Mary Street in Toronto while working on a cartoon in support of an anti-smoking campaign. At his memorial service on 22 November, the editor of the \"Hamilton Herald\", Albert E. S. Smythe, declared him the \"Canadian Dickens\" and one of Walt Whitman's \"great companions\".\n\nBengough was of average height and had grey eyes and dark hair. He married twice; neither marriage produced children. He married Helena \"Nellie\" Siddall in Toronto on 30 June 1880; she died in 1902. He remarried to a friend from his school days, the widow Annie Robertson Matteson, in Chicago on 18 June 1908. Neither appears to have written about Bengough.\n\nBengough drew mainly political cartoons. His cartoons and writing tend towards the preachy and didactic; he believed that humour should serve the interests of the state rather than merely to amuse. Bengough tended in his writing towards satirical humour and puns, which George Ramsay Cook called \"sometimes sophomoric\". He read Dickens, Shakespeare, and Carlyle with particular devotion.\n\nBengough had little exposure to formal art education aside from one term at the Ontario School of Art. His sketchy cartoons derived from a mid-19th century engraving style; while often drawn well, they were crowded in composition and sometimes borrowed from other sources. Bengough could draw in contrasting styles, as evidenced by cartoons he did under the pseudonym of L. Côté. As typical of political cartoonists of the time, Bengough aimed less at laughter than at social satire and depended more on readers' understanding of densely packed allusions.\n\nBengough's cartoons are best remembered for fixing his renditions of Macdonald in the public imagination. Bengough's bulbous-nosed politician often appeared baggy-eyed with bottles of alcohol in his hands as a sombre symbol of corruption, in contrast to the work of John Henry Walker, another prolific caricaturist of Macdonald who depicted the prime minister's drunkenness to make light of him. Bengough continued to hone his draftsmanship after Macdonald's death, but the wit and inspiration of his Macdonald cartoons continue to draw the most attention.\n\nBengough's chalk talks have left less of a mark on the public memory, though audience members have passed down Bengough's renditions of them as heirlooms. Bengough delivered humorous anecdotes and made impressions as he caricatured audience members and well-known locals in a flamboyant manner, adding the identifying details only at the end.\n\nBengough's reputation was as a supporter of the Liberal Party of Canada and its pro-democratic platform. His family had been supporters since before Confederation; his father had supported Oliver Mowat and both his brother Thomas and sister Mary worked in Mowat's provincial government. Members of his family were to play roles in the Liberal Party into the twentieth century; Bengough and his brother Thomas had ties close enough with Wilfrid Laurier to ask for favours, and both were also close to William Lyon Mackenzie King. Bengough had ambitions to run for Parliament, but Liberal leader Laurier convinced him against it; Laurier also turned down a request of Bengough's for a Senate appointment as reward for a lifetime of Liberal support.\n\n\"Grip\"s political stance was one of disinterest, but a large portion of Bengough's income came from Liberal publications, and Macdonald and his Conservatives were favourite targets of Bengough's cartoon attacks, notably during the Pacific Scandal. His association with the Liberals was so strong that Charles Tupper quipped in Parliament that \"Grip\" should change its name to \"Grit\"—a popular nickname for Liberal Party members. His best-remembered cartoons were those aimed at Macdonald and the Conservatives, but his criticisms targeted Liberals as well—Edward Blake had his subscription cancelled when he was the victim of a particular cartoon. Macdonald's Conservative \"Daily Mail\", launched in 1872, provided a rivalry with the Liberal \"Globe\" that provided fuel for Bengough's satire, as did infighting in the Liberal Party over \"The Globe\", which allowed Bengough to distance himself to a degree from criticism of Liberal partisanship.\n\nBengough was a proponent of such issues as proportional representation, prohibition of alcohol and of tobacco, the single tax espoused by Henry George, and worldwide free trade. He held progressive views on women's suffrage; in 1889 supported the Dominion Women's Enfranchisement Association efforts to have a bill proposed by Liberal MP John Waters that would have granted suffrage to Canadian women. He expressed anti-imperialist ideals until the mid-1890s, after which he supported imperialism. He supported Canada's involvement in the Second Boer War and First World War. Bengough contributed to the ongoing debates concerning the development of a Canadian identity during the nation's early years. He showed a marked ethnic nationalism in that he promoted English as the nation's sole official language, and the separation of church and state, a view that was directed particularly at the Catholic, French-speaking Québécois. He depicted the Québécois as backward and Quebec politicians as always demanding money. Bengough declared he looked forward to:\n\nBengough had liberal views on race relations, and painted a picture of Canada as being more open to integration than the US during the Reconstruction Era; according to David R. Spencer, his views on race were not likely widely shared in Canada at the time. While Bengough sympathized with the plight of Canada's native peoples, he condemned the 1885 North-West Rebellion and called for the execution of Métis rebel leader Louis Riel, and celebrated Major-General Frederick Dobson Middleton's victory at the Battle of Batoche in Saskatchewan with a poem. His racial caricatures could, according to Carman Cumming, lead a modern reader to see him as \"a racist chauvinist bigot\": they distort facial features and behaviour in ways typical of cartoons of the era and employ such derogatory terms as \"coon\" for blacks and \"sheeny\" for Jews. Bengough called for restrictions on Chinese and Irish immigration and his work shows a bias against immigrants who did not conform to Anglo-Saxon Protestant ideals.\n\nBengough intended his didactic cartoons to impart moral instruction. He expressed a deep devotion to religion. He had a Presbyterian upbringing, though as an adult he subscribed to no denomination. He promoted Christian ideals as solutions to social issues and thus, for example, opposed streetcars running on Sundays. He proclaimed a Protestant work ethic widely expressed by Canadian artists and intellectuals of the late 19th century. In his writing he frequently made statements about the role of Man in God's world, and insisted that politics should conform to the will of God. The editor of \"Canadian Methodist Magazine\" William Henry Withrow declared Bengough \"an Artist of Righteousness\" who was \"always on the right side of every moral question\".\n\nAs Nast had in the US, Bengough succeeded in establishing editorial cartooning as a force in journalism in the late 19th century. The church minister and Queen's College principal George Monro Grant called Bengough \"the most honest interpreter of current events to have\" and declared he had \"no malice in him\" but had \"a merry heart, and that doeth good like medicine\". The reformist English newspaper editor William Thomas Stead considered Bengough \"one of the ablest cartoonists in the world\".\n\nOutlets for political cartoons were mostly limited to illustrated magazines until they found a home in daily newspapers in the 20th century. Bengough's busy, moralizing style began to fall out of favour by the 1890s in contrast to the cleaner style practised by such cartoonists as Henri Julien and Sam Hunter. His caricatures nevertheless left an impression on the public consciousness in Canada for generations to follow.\n\nBengough's caricatures continue to illustrate Canadian texts—examples in which they are prominent include Creighton's biography \"John A. Macdonald\" (1952–55), Armstrong and Nelles' \"The Revenge of the Methodist Bicycle Company: Sunday Streetcars and Municipal Reform in Toronto, 1888–1897\" (1977), and Waite's \"Arduous Destiny: Canada 1874–1896\" (1971). Historians use the cartoons to demonstrate issues and attitudes of Bengough's era, as well as for their artistic qualities, removed from their satirical contexts. Historian Peter Busby Waite considered \"Grip\" \"one of the most interesting sources for the social history of Ontario in the latter nineteenth century\".\n\nBengough's artistic legacy rests chiefly on his caricatures of Macdonald. To Peter Desbarats and Terry Mosher, Bengough's bulbous-nosed caricatures of Macdonald as \"ungainly, boozy, and corrupt ... engraved itself on the public mind, particularly in the days before newspapers published photographs of politicians\". Macdonald nevertheless deflated much of the power his caricaturists might have had as he often made light of his own alcoholism. Bengough met the prime minister in person only once.\n\nThough his cartoons have continued to thrive, Bengough's life and career as a writer has drawn far less attention. Bengough biographer Stanley Paul Kutcher considered his poetry \"undistiguished\". Historian George Ramsay Cook commended Bengough's approach to have \"nurtured the growth of social criticism in late Victorian Canada without much of that humourless self-righteousness that so often characterizes reformers\". Historian Carman Cumming's \"Sketches of a Young Country\" provides an in-depth analysis of \"Grip\"s politics.\n\nThe town of Bengough, Saskatchewan, incorporated 15 March 1912, was named after the cartoonist. On 19 May 1938, the Canadian government listed Bengough as a Person of National Historic Significance and dedicated a plaque to him at 66 Charles Street East in Toronto. Bengough was inducted into the Canadian Cartoonist Hall of Fame in 2005. The McMaster University Library in Hamilton, Ontario, holds the J. W. Bengough papers in its Division of Archives and Research Collection.\n\n\nNo copies remain of the comic opera \"Hecuba; or Hamlet's Father's Deceased Wife's Sister\", a comic opera with score by G. Barton Brown. Publisher F. F. Siddall registered it for copyright in 1885. The opera may have been an earlier version of \"Puffe and Co., or Hamlet, Prince of Dry Goods\", for which an undated and possibly unpublished script exists, and for which Clarence Lucas had written a score that Bengough appears to have rejected.\n\n\n"}

It has a roll of about 750 pupils. \n\nThe school is twinned with the Mary Erskine School (MES), an all-girls independent school approximately one mile (1.6 km) from Stewart's Melville College. Together the combined Erskine Stewart's Melville Schools (ESMS) have a co-educational Junior School which is split between the two campuses and caters for pupils from 3 to 12 years old. The two schools share a Principal, and most extra-curricular activities, such as performing arts, are run jointly. Both SMC and MES are managed by the Merchant Company of Edinburgh, which is also responsible for the co-educational George Watson's College.\n\nStewart's Melville College originated from the merger of two schools — Daniel Stewart's College and Melville College — in 1972 to become Daniel Stewart's and Melville College. After the merger Melville's bright red trim replaced the dark red trim on the black Daniel Stewart's blazer for general use and the red blazer of Melville College was adopted for those awarded colours (for sporting and other achievements); recently use of the red blazer was limited to the head boy and his deputies, with colours being signified with a particular tie.\n\nMelville College was founded in 1832 by the Rev. Robert Cunningham in George Street but soon moved to Hill Street in the centre of Edinburgh with a teaching emphasis on modern subjects, such as science, rather than classical subjects – unusual at that time. The school moved a short distance to 8 Queen Street which was purchased in 1853 and then to Melville Street in the city's West End in 1920. Originally named \"The Edinburgh Institution for Languages and Mathematics\", its name changed to Melville College in 1936 about the same time as the caps and blazers of the boys were changed to bright red.\n\nDaniel Stewart's Hospital was opened in 1855 by the Merchant Company of Edinburgh. Daniel Stewart (whose wealth came from India and was Macer to the Court of the Exchequer), upon his death in 1814, left a sum of money and instructions that, once it had reached £40,000 it should be used to create a hospital for needy boys within the city. The hospital was located on the current Queensferry Road campus (designed by David Rhind). The hospital was transformed into \"Daniel Stewart's College\" in 1870. The school uniform from 1924 onwards was a cap with red and black stripes and a black blazer with red trim.\n\nIn 1974 the link with another nearby Merchant Company school, the all-girls Mary Erskine School, was formalised and The Mary Erskine and Stewart's Melville Junior School was formed. Nursery to Primary 3 are housed on the Mary Erskine campus, with Primary 4 to 7 on the Stewart's Melville campus. The sixth (final) form of both senior schools is coeducational.\n\nIn 2013, Stewart's Melville was voted the Scottish Independent School of the year by the Sunday Times newspaper and Mary Erskine School was voted the Scottish Independent School of the year in 2012. In 2014 the combined Erskine Stewarts Melville school, with over 2,700 pupils, claimed to be the largest independent school in Europe.\n\nIn 2014, a programme of improvement work on buildings of the junior school was announced, and as of 2018, work has begun.\n\nStewart's Melville College has won the Brewin Dolphin Scottish Schools Cup Under-18 rugby championships five times: in 1999 (in their first year of entering), 2006, 2011, 2016 and 2019. The Former Pupils Rugby club also play in Division 1 of the Scottish National Premier League.\n\n\"Ravelston Sports Club\", a large on-site sports centre opened in 2000. The sports centre is mainly used by pupils for physical education lessons and sports training (such as swimming, basketball, badminton, short tennis and table tennis) but is also open to members of the public for a monthly membership fee. Extensive rugby pitches, cricket pitches, athletics facilities and hockey pitches are also located at the school's sports grounds in Inverleith, two miles north of the school.There is also a school shooting range located at the Ravelston campus. \n\nMost recently Stewart's Melville College won the Mitsubishi U18 cup - played at Murrayfield Stadium - against local rivals George Watson's.\n\nThe school's main Victorian assembly hall was converted to the \"Performing Arts Centre\" between 2005 and 2007. This £3.5 million project, was paid for in part by donations from the parents of the schools current pupils and former pupils. The Centre has 800 seats that fold back into the wall, providing a variety of possible configurations and was officially opened in 2007. It is also available for use by the public and is used as a venue for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\nIn 2011 actor John Cairney unveiled the new name for the centre, \"Tom Fleming Centre for Performing Arts\", named after former pupil Tom Fleming, one of Scotland's leading broadcasters.\n\nSince 1965, the school has organised an outdoor education programme for the boys of SMC and the girls from MES in the third year. It takes place in the north of Scotland, based for over forty years at Carbisdale Castle Youth Hostel, Easter Ross, until its closure in 2011 required accommodation to relocate to Aviemore.\n\nPupils at Stewart's Melville mainly sit Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) examinations, including (as of 2013) National 4, National 5, Higher Grade and Advanced Higher Grade levels. The English GCE Advanced Level examinations can also be sat in art and music. Almost all pupils go on to higher education. In 2014, popular destinations included Aberdeen (18), St Andrews (17), Glasgow (17), Strathclyde (10), Edinburgh (8), Newcastle (6) and Heriot-Watt (5).\n\nThe school maintains a Former Pupils Club, which organises social events throughout the year.

Manning composed the first full-length musical to be broadcast on television. \"The Boys From Boise\" aired on the DuMont Television Network in 1944.\n\nManning was born in Gomel, and came to the United States with his family when he was six years old. He studied at the Juilliard School of Music. Manning changed his name from Medoff in 1948, when he was beginning to have success with his songwriting.\n\nIn the early 1940s, he had a radio show on WHN radio in New York called \"Sam Medoff and His Yiddish Swing Orchestra\"; he performed with his band, \"The Yiddish Swingtet\". Manning and the band were also regulars on \"Yiddish Melodies in Swing\", which was also broadcast on WHN. The 15 minute weekly radio show, which blended traditional Yiddish folk music with swing and jazz, got its start on the station in 1938. Medoff and the Swingtet were hired to give a new twist to the traditional songs, as well as introduce new popular songs performed in Yiddish. The Barry Sisters (Claire and Merna) were the vocalists for the program. The radio show was originally done live at the Lowes State Theatre every Sunday at 1PM; it aired until 1955. Medoff also played piano and organ for Yiddish crooner Seymour Rexite's radio show.\n\nManning was the co-writer of many popular songs, among them:\"Takes Two to Tango\", \"Fascination\", \"Hot Diggity\" and \"Papa Loves Mambo\". They were recorded by artists such as Perry Como, Sammy Kaye, Kate Smith and others. Manning's songs have been published in 27 languages. In 1956, Manning shared a late-night subway ride with Perry Como's music publisher, Mickey Glass. As the two men talked, Glass mentioned a need for a new novelty song for Como. Manning said he had just made a demo recording of something like that which had yet to be heard by anyone else. Glass arranged to hear Manning's demo the next day; Como's recording of \"Hot Diggity\" was the result of the chance meeting of Manning and Glass.\n\nManning also composed \"The Boys From Boise,\" which was the story of a troupe of show girls who were stranded on an Idaho ranch. The girls take jobs as cowgirls on the ranch in an effort to raise enough money to return home. This was the first full-length television musical, and was presented on the DuMont Television Network in 1944. The television presentation of the musical was sponsored by \"Esquire\" magazine. Manning appeared earlier in that year on DuMont's \"Key-Bored Televisual Presentations\" as a pianist. Manning also was an arranger and vocal coach, and wrote radio jingles.\n\nManning, the father of two daughters and a son, died of diabetes-related complications in Marietta, Georgia on April 11, 1991.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is remembered as the author of the novella \"The Battle of Dorking\" (1871), a founding work in the genre of invasion literature.\n\nGeorge Tomkyns Chesney was born on 30 April 1830 in Tiverton, Devon, one of six children of Sophia Augusta (Cauty) Chesney and Charles Cornwallis Chesney. His brother, Colonel Charles Cornwallis Chesney, achieved prominence as a soldier and military writer; and his sister Matilda Marian Pullan, as a writer on needlework. He was educated at Blundell's School, Tiverton, and at Addiscombe Military Seminary (1847–8).\n\nChesney joined the Bengal Engineers as a second lieutenant in 1848. He was employed for some years in the public works department and, on the outbreak of the Indian rebellion of 1857, joined the Ambala column, was field engineer at the battle of Badli-ki-Serai, brigade-major of engineers throughout the siege of Delhi, and was severely wounded in the assault (he received a medal and clasp and a brevet majority).\n\nIn 1860, he was appointed head of a new department in connection with the public works accounts. His work on \"Indian Polity\" (1868), dealing with the administration of the several departments of the Indian government, attracted wide attention and remains a permanent text-book. The originator of the Royal Indian Civil Engineering College at Coopers Hill, Englefield Green, Egham, he was also its first president (1871–1880).\n\nHe was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1869, colonel in 1877, major general in 1886, lieutenant general in 1887, colonel-commandant of Royal Engineers in 1890, and general in 1892. From 1881 to the government of India, and was made a Companion of Order of the Star of India (C.S.I.) and a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (C.I.E.).\n\nFrom 1886 to 1892, as military member of the governor-generals council, he carried out many much-needed military reforms. He also championed Indianization: the admission of Indians into the higher (British) officer corps of the Indian Army. However, he was unsuccessful, mainly because of the implacable opposition of General Sir Frederick (later Lord) Roberts, the then commander-in-chief of the Indian Army, who contended that these officer posts were \"properly reserved for the governing (i.e. British) race\".\n\nChesney was a frequent contributor to periodical literature. In 1871, he published, initially anonymously, a highly influential short story (or novella) entitled \"The Battle of Dorking\" in \"Blackwoods Magazine\". This was a vivid account of a supposed invasion of England by the Germans after their victory over France: it was subsequently republished in many editions and translations, and is considered a founding piece of the invasion literature genre.\n\nHe also published several novels, including \"A True Reformer\" (1873) \"The Dilemma\" (1875), \"The Private Secretary\" (1881), and \"The Lesters\" (1893), although none achieved the popular success of \"The Battle of Dorking\".\n\nOn leaving India in 1892, Chesney was elected to the Parliament of the United Kingdom as a Conservative Party candidate, as member for Oxford. He was chairman of the Committee of Service Members of the House of Commons until his death.\n\nChesney was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (C.B.) at the jubilee of 1887, and a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (K.C.B.) in the New Year's Honours list 1 January 1890.\n\nChesney died suddenly of angina pectoris at his residence, 27 Inverness Terrace, London, on 31 March 1895, and was buried at Englefield Green, Surrey, on 5 April.\n\nChesney married, in 1855, Annie Louisa, daughter of George Palmer of Purneah, Bengal, who, with four sons and three daughters, survived him.\n\n\n\n"}

His short-story collection \"A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain\" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1993.\n\nButler was born in Granite City, Illinois, to Robert Olen Butler Sr., an actor and theater professor who became the chairman of the theater department of Saint Louis University, and his wife, the former Lucille Frances Hall, an executive secretary.\n\nButler attended Northwestern University as a theater major (BS, 1967) and switched to playwriting at the University of Iowa (MA, 1969).\n\nButler served in Vietnam from 1969 to 1971, first as a counter-intelligence special agent for the Army and later as a translator. He rose to the rank of sergeant in the Army Military Intelligence Corps. His experiences during that period have informed his writings, and as a result, in 1987 Butler received the Tu Do Chinh Kien Award from the Vietnam Veterans of America for outstanding contributions to American culture by a veteran. \"My greatest pleasure in life was at 2 in the morning to wander out into the steamy back alleys of Saigon, where nobody ever seemed to sleep, and just walk the alleys and crouch in the doorways with the people,\" Butler told \"The New York Times\" in 1993. \"The Vietnamese were the warmest, most open and welcoming people I've ever met, and they just invited me into their homes and into their culture and into their lives.\"\n\nAfter working as a steel mill laborer, a taxi driver, and a substitute teacher in high schools in the years following his tour of duty in Vietnam, Butler joined Fairchild Publications, where he worked on the staffs of trade publications such as \"Electronic News\". From 1975 until 1985, he was the editor-in-chief of Fairchild's \"Energy User News\" (now \"Energy & Power Management\").\n\nRobert Olen Butler is the author of 12 novels and six short story collections, including \"A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain\", which won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. In a review for the \"Guardian\" newspaper, renowned author Claire Messud wrote, \"The book has attracted such acclaim not simply because it is beautifully and powerfully written, but because it convincingly pulls off an immense imaginative risk. . . . Butler has not entered the significant and ever-growing canon of Vietnam-related fiction (he has long been a member)—he has changed its composition forever.\"\n\nButler began writing novels on the Long Island Railroad while working as a publicist for Fairchild Publications. \"Every word of my first four published novels was written on a legal pad, by hand, on my lap, on the Long Island Rail Road as I commuted back and forth from Sea Cliff to Manhattan,\" Butler has said about his early writing.\n\nThe author's first novel was \"The Alleys of Eden\", which was published in 1981 by Horizon Press after being rejected by 21 publishers. Its protagonist is an American deserter who decides to stay in Vietnam, as Butler's one-time writing professor Anatole Broyard wrote in \"The New York Times\", \"because, with all its troubles, Vietnam seems to him to retain more of its integrity, its sense of self, than the America he has left behind.\"\nPrior to the publication of \"The Alleys of Eden\", Butler had written, by his estimation, \"five ghastly novels, about forty dreadful short stories, and twelve truly awful full-length plays, all of which have never seen the light of day and never will.\"\n\nButler has always been a controversial artist, seemingly reinventing himself with each new novel or short story collection. His shape-shifting often polarizes reviewers, as was the case with Butler's second novel \"Sun Dogs\" (Horizon, 1983), which \"The New York Times\" described as having \"some powerful moments, some engrossing scenes and deft touches, but there is little momentum, no satisfying pattern, none of the magic of synergy.\" Conversely, the \"Ft. Worth Star-Telegram\" lauded the book as \"full of power and energy...mov[ing] from the most feverish of prose to a flatness and sparseness that is reminiscent of the best of Chandler and Hammett. And most importantly, he has something to say... Butler is an intelligent novelist who cares about his characters. He is skillful enough to make the reader feel the same way. It is not often that we get the chance to witness the birth of something this important.\"\n\nButler's stories have appeared in such publications as \"The New Yorker\", \"Esquire\", \"Harper's\", \"The Atlantic Monthly\", \"GQ\", and \"\". He has had stories included in a combined twelve editions of \"The Best American Short Stories\", \"New Stories From the South\", and numerous college literature textbooks. Butler has also written screenplays for film and television, most of them based on other writers' material.\n\nButler's short-story collections \"Tabloid Dreams\" (1996) and \"Had a Good Time\" (2004) take their inspiration from popular culture. The stories in \"Tabloid Dreams\" were spun from the titles of outlandish articles in supermarket tabloids. \"Had a Good Time\" builds its narratives around the images on vintage American picture postcards, which Butler has collected for more than a decade. One example is the tale \"Mother in the Trenches\", first published in \"Harper's\" in February 2003. It traces the journey of Mrs. Jack Gaines, a prosperous matron, from her comfortable home to the battlefields of World War I France, in order to convince her soldier son to come home; the story's basis is a period postcard that depicts a stout, middle-aged woman wearing dark clothes and a cloche hat.\n\nAgain the critical response varied dramatically. While the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said that the stories \"feel like a literary parlor game,\" \"The Boston Globe\" raved that it was full of \"crisp writing, marvelous imagining, the discussion of large, existential questions that are as central to life now as they were a hundred years ago.\"\n\n\"Severance,\" his 2006 collection of 240-word short stories about the post-beheading thoughts of decapitated individuals (from Nicole Brown Simpson to Louis XVI to the author himself) was the basis of \"Severance\", a one-act play by David Jette. It was produced in 2007 at McCadden Place Theatre in Los Angeles. At the time, Butler described \"Severance\" as his best and most ambitious book.\n\nThis was the first of an extended venture into defining and exploring the short short story form. His companion collection, \"Intercourse\", comprising 100 very short stories, revealed the inner monologues of couples (often famous) engaged in sexual intercourse. \"Weegee Stories,\" presenting the inner monologues of the subjects of 60 iconic photographs of Arthur \"Weegee\" Fellig, continued his interest in the form. He also published a theory of the short short story in \"Narrative Magazine\".\n\nAs further evidence of his predilection for self-reinvention, in 2009 he published \"Hell\", a \"roaring satire\" of a novel set entirely in the underworld. His 2011 novel, \"A Small Hotel\", is described by Donna Seaman of \"Booklist\", the American Library Association's magazine, as a \"sexy novel of psychological suspense.\" She goes on to say, \"Butler executes a plot twist of profound proportions in this gorgeously controlled, unnerving, and beautifully revealing tale of the consequences of emotional withholding.\"\n\nIn still another act of reinvention, Butler publishes his first literary/historical/espionage/thriller, \"The Hot Country\", with Otto Penzler's \"Mysterious Press\" in the fall of 2012.\n\nIn 2001, Butler wrote in real-time, a complete short story, \"This is Earl Sandt,\" from first inspiration to final story, in a webcast of 17 two-hour sessions. As the author explained of the broadcasts, \"What we're trying to do here is reproduce for you what is normally hidden behind the veil of private life.\". The webcasts, under its webcast title of \"Inside Creative Writing,\" have become a popular download on iTunes.\n\nButler taught creative writing from 1985 to 2000 at McNeese State University in Lake Charles, Louisiana, with his colleague John Wood, to whom he dedicated \"A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain\". He then joined the faculty of Florida State University as a Francis Eppes Distinguished Professor, holding the Michael Shaara Chair in Creative Writing, where he currently teaches.\n\nButler is a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in fiction and a National Endowment for the Arts grant, and was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award. In 2001 he won a National Magazine Award for \"Fair Warning,\" a short story that was published in the journal \"Zoetrope: All-Story\", and, four years later, he won another National Magazine Award for \"The One in White,\" a short story published in \"The Atlantic Monthly\".\n\nIn 1993, his first story collection, \"A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain\", won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. \"The New York Times\" praised the book's \"startling, dreamlike\"\nstories about the lives of Vietnamese immigrants living in Louisiana, and said it was \"remarkable not for its flaws, but for how beautifully it achieves its daring project of making the Vietnamese real.\"\nThe Pulitzer committee said that the stories \"raise the literature of the Vietnam conflict to an original and highly personal new level.\"\n\nButler also judged the annual Robert Olen Butler Prize, a short-fiction award founded and sponsored by Del Sol Press, with the most recent prize being awarded in 2010.\nHe also judges \"The Southeast Review's\" short-short story contest.\n\n\nOn August 10, 1968, Butler married Carol Supplee. They divorced in January 1972.\n\nOn July 1, 1972, Butler married poet Marylin Geller (now known professionally as Marylin Krepf).\n\nOn July 21, 1987, Butler married Maureen Donlan. They divorced in March 1995.\n\nOn April 23, 1995, at Tavern on the Green restaurant in New York City, Butler married the novelist and playwright Elizabeth Dewberry (born September 7, 1962). The couple ended their marriage in July 2007 (\"The Washington Post\" reported that they were officially divorced on July 19), according to e-mail Butler sent to his graduate students and fellow professors at Florida State University regarding Dewberry's decision to leave him for communications mogul Ted Turner. A controversy arose over the highly personal revelations contained within Butler's e-mail, which was leaked by one of its recipients and subsequently reported on by major international media outlets, such as \"The Washington Post\", \"The New York Times\", and National Public Radio.\n\nOn November 22, 2011, Butler married Kelly Lee Daniels, now known professionally as Kelly Lee Butler. They divorced in April 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is initially a spin-off from the \"Tekken\" series of fighting games. Originally announced with the title \"Nina\", the game was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2005. It is the first \"Tekken\" game to be Rated M (Mature) by ESRB.\n\nThe game is fully controlled by the analog sticks. The left analog stick is touch-sensitive; through various degrees of holding, tapping or pressing along with other buttons allows the player character Nina Williams to walk, run or evade. The right analog stick is used for offensive moves.\n\nThe game's most remarkable feature is the ability to allow Nina to use her martial arts skills to break the bones of her enemies through use of carefully aimed attacks. These attacks do more damage to the enemy and show the player the damage being inflicted on the opponent's skeletal structure. Strangely, this does little to actually disable opponents, as they often continue to use limbs that have been literally shattered, as well as survive blows to the head that would cause the skull to practically explode, without even losing consciousness.\n\nOnce the game is completed, \"Anna Mode\" will be unlocked, offering the player the ability to play as Nina's younger sibling and rival, Anna Williams. Various outfits can be unlocked throughout the game, which include a bikini, cocktail dress, purple jumpsuit, black and silver stealth suit. Playing the game a second time causes LCD crates throughout the game to contain infinite supplies of certain weapons, such as infinite katana and infinite rail-gun. After completing the game twice, the wrestling costume as seen in the opening FMV is also unlocked. A third clear game file additionally unlocks \"Tekken 2 Nina\", which instead of an outfit is actually a different facial and bodily construction, exactly as she appears in the \"Tekken\" title, in low resolution.\n\nNina Williams, world-renowned assassin, has been hired by the CIA and MI6 to join a team that is attempting to infiltrate \"Kometa,\" a notorious criminal organization. The team's strategy involves gaining access to the target through a fighting tournament being held on the \"Amphitrite,\" a luxury cruise ship owned and operated by Kometa. A leaked video on the Internet showed a Kometa ship exploding within the Bermuda Triangle, and it is feared that they are working on some kind of superweapon in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union. Nina's official cover involves infiltration as a competitor in the tournament. However, Nina is also the team's \"sweeper\"; should her partners fail, she must finish the job. Nina enters the competition but is quickly discovered and captured. She soon receives a communication informing her of the team's failure and the death of one of the agents named John Doe (killed by Kometa executive Edgar Grant), and that she must now conduct the operation herself.\n\nNina must fight her way through Kometa's forces and expose the truth behind its criminal activities. As she progresses in her mission, Nina fights the Kometa's top executives, starting with the personal bodyguard and lover of Lana Lei, Bryce Adams. She then moves on to photograph a meeting of the directors, with the help of MI6 agent Alan Smithee.\n\nNina barely escapes the cruise ship with her life and is taken to a Kometa Island research facility. Here, she encounters Lukas Hayes, a scientist who informs her about Kometa's plan to use satellites to heat and activate methane hydrate on the ocean floor. The result is bubbling, which causes ships to lose their buoyancy. The weapon thus has the power to destroy naval vehicles from afar, sinking them to the bottom of the sea. Hayes' plan was to find a new energy source and alternative to fossil fuels, but his research was twisted into a form of warfare. The project is Salacia, the mysterious operation CIA and MI6 have heard rumors of. Nina realizes that she must stop the project, and takes on the second Kometa executive, Enrique Ortega. However, he is joined by Anna Williams (Nina's sister), hired along with the Tekken Force as bodyguards. After briefly engaging in combat with Anna, Nina continues on her mission and after Enrique's conversation on video link with the head of the Mishima Zaibatsu, Heihachi Mishima, Nina manages to kill Enrique. Lukas Hayes, however, is also killed as Lana Lei arrives and recovers a case which houses the electronics to operate Salacia's satellites. With Alan's help, Nina escapes the base by helicopter, chasing Lana Lei back to the luxury cruise ship.\n\nFor a second time, Nina must fight her way through the Kometa boat, only this time against advanced cyborg soldiers, another of Lei's weapons projects. After recovering the keys to her quarters, Nina finds Salacia and engages with Lana. After her defeat, they are interrupted by Alan, who is revealed as Kometa executive Edgar Grant. Shooting Lana, he acknowledges that he is also a sweeper, there to destroy all evidence of his part in the atrocities. Before he can kill Nina, however, Lana shoots him dead and escapes to a secret room. There, Nina witnesses her powering Salacia, targeting methane hydrate pockets all around the United States coastline. Nina finishes Lana off before she can continue with her insane plan, and makes her way to an escape pod as a self-destruct mode is activated on the boat. Her pod, however, explodes, and Nina lands on the ship's edge. As a rescue helicopter comes for her, she is knocked down by none other than Anna Williams. The two sisters face off as the ship nears destruction and almost both fall to their deaths. However, the two grudgingly work together to escape and grab the helicopter rope line, with Nina having a flashback to the events before her father's death, in particular, the moments following when the two sisters comforted one another. Anna drops Nina into the ocean after saying that they are now even. Nina watches on as rescue boats approach from behind her, the Kometa ship exploding and sinking, as Anna leaves on the helicopter.\n\n\"Death by Degrees\" received mixed reviews from critics. While the cutscenes and depth of story were praised, critics generally found fault with difficult camera angles, extensive loading times, and system control, which limited all fighting sequences to use of the analog stick. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 29 out of 40.\n\n\"\" - A spin off of the \"Mortal Kombat\" series with a similar premise.\n"}

The Node B provides the connection between mobile phones (UEs) and the wider telephone network. UMTS is the dominating 3G standard. \n\nNode B corresponds to BTS (base transceiver station) in GSM. \n\nThis is the hardware that is connected to the mobile phone network that communicates directly with mobile handsets. In contrast with GSM base stations, Node B uses WCDMA/TD-SCDMA as the air interface technology. As in all cellular systems, such as UMTS and GSM, the Node B contains radio frequency transmitter(s) and the receiver(s) used to communicate directly with mobile devices, which move freely around it. In this type of cellular network, the mobile devices cannot communicate directly with each other but have to communicate with the NodeB.\n\nTraditionally, the Node Bs have minimum functionality, and are controlled by an RNC (Radio Network Controller). However, this is changing with the emergence of High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), where some logic (e.g., retransmission) is handled on the Node B for lower response times.\n\nThe utilization of WCDMA technology allows cells belonging to the same or different Node Bs and even controlled by different RNC to overlap and still use the same frequency (in fact, the whole network can be implemented with just one frequency pair). The effect is utilized in soft handovers.\n\nSince WCDMA often operates at higher frequencies than GSM (2,100 MHz as opposed to 900 MHz for GSM), the cell radius can be considerably smaller for WCDMA than for GSM cells as the path loss is frequency dependent. WCDMA now has networks operating in the 850–900 MHz band. In these networks, at these frequencies, the coverage of WCDMA is considered better than that of the equivalent GSM network.\n\nUnlike in GSM, the cells' size is not constant (a phenomenon known as \"cell breathing\"). This requires a larger number of Node Bs and careful planning in 3G (UMTS) networks. Power requirements on Node Bs and user equipment (UE) are much lower.\n\nIt is connected to RNC of UMTS network through IUB interface.\n\nA full cell site has a cabinet, an antenna mast and actual antenna. An equipment cabinet contains e.g. RF power amplifiers, digital signal processors and backup batteries. What you can see by the side of a road or in a city center is just an antenna. However, the tendency nowadays is to camouflage the antenna (paint it the color of the building or put it into an RF-transparent enclosure). Smaller indoor nodes may have an antenna built into the cabinet door.\n\nA Node B can serve several cells, also called sectors, depending on the configuration and type of antenna. Common configuration include omni cell (360°), 3 sectors (3×120°) or 6 sectors (60 degree each, not a very popular deployment).\n\n"}

He was hired by Jim Crockett Jr. after he would hang around the wrestlers trying to get a job. Boulware, using the ring name Rocky King, started wrestling in 1985 in the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions in North Carolina. He began his career in the promotion as a jobber. He quickly improved and was often allowed a lot of offense during his jobber matches. He was a frequent opponent of the Four Horsemen.\n\nAfter spending some time in Florida, King returned to North Carolina where he wrestled under promoter Pez Whatley. In 1987, he teamed with George South.\n\nKing was loosely associated with the Dudes With Attitudes in early 1990 during their feud with the Four Horsemen. In late 1990, after Crockett was purchased and renamed World Championship Wrestling, King got a gimmick change and became Little Richard Marley, manager of Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin, the Fabulous Freebirds. He helped them in their feud with the Southern Boys for a couple of months. At Starrcade in 1990, he inadvertently cost the Freedbirds their match against Tommy Rich and Ricky Morton. After the match, the Freebirds attacked him. He then went back to wrestling as Rocky King. King became a WCW referee before retiring in 1998.\n\nIn July 1999, he started BWA Professional Wrestling to give fans a family-oriented product on the independent scene. He also formed Boulware Enterprises, Inc. to run his promotion Boulware Wrestling Association. The BWA runs shows for churches, non-profit organizations and private organizations on the east coast.

The Doug Wright Awards are named after him to honour excellence in Canadian cartooning.\n\nAfter emigrating to Canada in 1938, Wright worked as an illustrator at an insurance company before serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War Two. It was here that his cartoons of fellow servicemen first drew the eye of a magazine editor. After freelancing in Montreal for a few years after the war, Wright took over \"Juniper Junction\" in 1948 after its creator, Jimmy Frise, died suddenly. Within a year, Wright launched a wordless and untitled gag strip about a little boy for the \"Montreal Standard\" (called \"The Weekend\" magazine after 1951). Eventually entitled \"Nipper\", the strip switched to \"The Canadian\", another national weekly newspaper supplement, in 1967 and the name was changed to \"Doug Wright's Family\". Wright suffered a stroke in March 1980, and had another stroke on January 3, 1983.

The wrapper calls them \"a fat free food\", and they are gluten-free. The sweet fishy treats are marketed in different colors and flavors.\n\nAccording to the US distribution packages, Swedish Fish is made out of the following ingredients:\n\nOne of the ingredients in Swedish Fish is invert sugar, a combination of glucose and fructose. Invert sugar is important in Swedish Fish due to its ability to retain moisture.\n\nFructose has high solubility, therefore it holds more water and crystallizes less easily. This is why Swedish Fish have a very long shelf life and do not spoil easily.\n\nSwedish Fish contain modified cornstarch which is used primarily to form its shape. It is utilized as a medium in trays when the product is put in them to be molded. In addition, white mineral oil is added to these trays to supplement the starch, prevent the candy from crumbling, and give it a shiny coating.\n\nCarnauba wax is used in Swedish Fish as a coating and gives the candy a waxy texture.\n\nCitric acid gives the Swedish Fish an even longer shelf life.\n\nIn Sweden, a large share of confectionery sales are sold as pick and mix. Wine gums are sold in many different shapes, of which fish is just one. The Swedish Fish candy is marketed under the name \"pastellfiskar\", literally \"pastel fish\", and under the Malaco brand among others. The fish shaped candies are also part of various Malaco bags of mixed candy. This candy bag has been sold for many years and is still popular among the Swedish people.\n\nToday the Swedish Fish consumed in North America are made in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and Turkey by Mondelēz International. In Canada, Swedish Fish are distributed under Mondelez International's Maynards brand.\n\nThe fish are distributed in the U.S. by Mondelēz International. The fish-shaped candy gained enough popularity on its own to where the Malaco, and later Cadbury, company had to do little advertising for the product, until this past decade. A recent resurgence in popularity has resulted in greater accessibility in supermarkets and convenience stores where they are often sold prepackaged in plastic bags. Building upon this resurgence, the company recently created \"Giant Fish\" television advertisements and a \"Treadin' Water\" YouTube mini-series, which follows the miscellaneous adventures of four friends and a Giant Swedish Fish sharing an apartment. The first few episodes of the mini-series were published onto YouTube on May 9, 2016.\n\nOriginally colored red with a flavor unique to the candy (often guessed to be lingonberry, but never verified), they are now also available in several different colors, such as Orange & Lemon-Lime. Purple Swedish Fish in grape flavor were discontinued in 2006. The fish come in two different sizes. Initially, the smaller fish came only in red; now fish of both sizes are available in all flavors. According to a visit to the factory on the Food Network's show \"Unwrapped\", green is not lime, but pineapple flavor, while yellow is a lemon-lime flavor.\n\nAlthough well known in the U.S., Swedish Fish were only launched on the U.S. market in the late 1950s. The original owner of these candies was the Swedish company Malaco, who wanted to expand its sales to North America. Wanting to create a product that reflected the culture of Sweden in some way, a fish-shaped gummy candy was created. Fishing was and is still a large part of Sweden's culture, and fish is a considerable part of the Swedish diet. Mondelez distributes the candy in the U.S. today, but the fish gummies are still distributed by Malaco in Sweden.\n\nIn 2009, Rita's Italian Ice, a U.S. chain which serves Italian ice and frozen custard, introduced a red Swedish Fish flavored Italian ice as a cobranded product.\n\nTrident, a gum company owned by Mondelez Global, produced a Swedish Fish flavored product, which is advertised as \"Berry + Lemon\" flavor.\n\nIn 2016, Nabisco created a test-market product Swedish Fish Oreos, available at Kroger grocery stores in the US.\n\n"}

(; ; ), was an Italian monk and religious, the founder of the famed hospice and monastery which has served travelers for nearly a millennium as a refuge in the most dangerous part of the western Alps. It has been served by its own congregation of canons regular throughout its history. The famous breed of St. Bernard dogs were named after the hospice as they were bred to help on rescue missions during winter storms.\n\nBernard was born probably in the Château de Menthon, near Annecy, then in the County of Savoy, a part of the Kingdom of Arles. He was descended from a rich and noble family and received a thorough education in Paris. When he had reached adulthood, he decided to devote himself to the service of the Church and refused an honorable marriage proposed by his father. (In popular legend it is said that he had to sneak out of the castle on the night before an arranged wedding, and that during his flight from the castle, he threw himself from his window, only to be caught by angels and lowered gently to the ground 40 feet (12 meters) below.)\n\nPlacing himself under the direction of Peter, the Archdeacon of Aosta, under whose guidance he rapidly progressed, Bernard was ordained a priest and worked as a missionary in the mountain villages. Later, on account of his learning and virtue, he was appointed to succeed his mentor as archdeacon of the cathedral, giving him charge of the government of the diocese, directly under the bishop.\n\nFor 42 years, he continued to preach the Gospel to these people and even into many cantons of Lombardy, effecting numerous conversions and working many miracles. The last act of St. Bernard's life was the reconciliation of two noblemen whose strife threatened a fatal outcome. He died in June 1081 in the Imperial Free City of Novara and was interred in the monastery of St. Lawrence.\n\nSince the most ancient times there has been a path across the Pennine Alps leading from the Aosta Valley to the Swiss canton of Valais. The traditional route of this pass is covered with perpetual snow from seven to eight feet deep, and drifts sometimes accumulate to the height of forty feet. Although the pass was extremely dangerous, especially in the springtime on account of avalanches, it was often used by French and German pilgrims on their way to Rome.\n\nIn his office as archdeacon, Bernard had the charge of caring for the poor and travelers. For their convenience and protection, Bernard founded a canonry and hostel at the highest point of the pass, 8,000 feet above sea-level, in the year 1050, at the site which has come to bear his name. A few years later he established another hostel on the Little St. Bernard Pass, a mountain saddle in the Graian Alps, 7,076 feet above sea-level. Both were placed in charge of communities of canons regular, after papal approval had been obtained by Bernard during a visit to Rome. The new community was placed under the patronage of Saint Nicholas of Myra, patron saint of travelers.\n\nToday the tunnel and modern technology have made rescue operations at the pass mainly unnecessary. The dogs were put up for sale in 2004 because of the high cost of maintenance and were promptly bought by foundations created for the purpose.\n\nThese hostels were renowned for the generous hospitality extended to all travelers over the Great and Little St. Bernard, so called in honor of the founder of these charitable institutions. At all seasons of the year, but especially during heavy snow-storms, the canons, later accompanied by their well-trained dogs, the common herding dogs of the Valais (\"St Bernards\" are attested from the 17th century), went out in search of victims who might have succumbed to the severity of the weather. They offered food, clothing, and shelter to the unfortunate travelers and took care of the dead. They depended on gifts and collections for sustenance.\n\nAs of 2012 the congregation consisted of around 35 professed members, the majority of whom live at the hostel while some provide pastoral care to neighboring parishes. St. Bernard dogs are still on the site as pets; helicopters are used in rescue operations today.\n\nAlthough venerated from the 12th century in such places of northern Italy as Aosta, Novara and Brescia, Bernard was not formally recognized as a saint until his canonization by Pope Innocent XI in 1681. His feast is celebrated on 28 May or June 15 (Roman Martyrology). Pope Pius XI confirmed Bernard as the patron saint of the Alps in 1923. His image appears in the flag of some detachments of the Tyrolean Alpine Guard. He is also the patron saint of skiing, snowboarding, hiking, backpacking, mountaineering.\n\nSaint Bernard's Catholic Church in Saranac Lake, New York is named for him.\n\n"}

The editor of another contemporary organization writing in 1907 did not look upon the organization kindly, pointing out that the sale of its journal and other forms of advertisement appeared to be the main objective. Nationally, it organises conferences, study days, field weeks and weekends, lectures, and exhibitions.

The presidents of NTI, Makivik Corporation, Nunatsiavut, and the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, the four regional land claims organizations, govern the national body, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK) as its board of directors. NTI continues to play a central role in Nunavut, even after the creation of the Government of Nunavut. As the successor of the Tunngavik Federation of Nunavut, which was a signatory of the \"Nunavut Land Claims Agreement\" on behalf of Inuit, NTI is responsible for ensuring that the \"Nunavut Land Claims Agreement\" is implemented fully by the Government of Canada and the Government of Nunavut and that all parties fulfill their obligations.\n\nNTI is governed by a ten-member board of directors. Three of the directors -the President, the First Vice President and Second Vice President- are elected directly by beneficiaries of the \"Nunavut Land Claims Agreement\" who are 16 years and older. Six of the directors are the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the three Regional Inuit Associations located in Nunavut. The four member Executive consists of the presidents of NTI and the three RIAs.\n\nNTI’s mission is to implement \"Inuit economic, social and cultural well-being\" through the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. NTI originated as a political activist body. Although it is now an organization with significant responsibilities for administering the \"Nunavut Land Claims Agreement\", it continues as an advocate for the rights of Inuit. NTI plays a lead role in helping Inuit and Inuit organizations understand their rights and obligations under the NLCA. Finding out what the NLCA says is the first step for anyone who wants to use his or her rights or benefits. The Government of Nunavut protects the interests of all residents of Nunavut and NTI protects the rights of Inuit in Nunavut.\n\nWhat is now known as Nunavut was officially separated from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, through the 1993 \"Nunavut Act\" and the 1993 \"Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act\",\n\nThe NTI consists of ten departments: Lands & Resources, Wildlife, Claim Implementation, Human Resources, Business & Economic Development, Communications, Legal Services, Finance, Administration, and Social & Cultural Development.\n\nFor NTI, the \"Nunavut Land Claims Agreement\", signed in May 1993 by Inuit and the Canadian government, is the central structure through which NTI identifyies policy priorities and directions. Policy and program priorities are determined by what Claim obligations, either Inuit or government, have yet to be implemented. Priorities can stem from the necessity of meeting ongoing Inuit obligations. Inuit were represented by the Tungavik Federation of Nunavut, which went on to become Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. The Government of Canada and the Government of the Northwest Territories signed the NLCA on behalf of the Queen. \n\nThe NLCA will protect this reality by giving special duties to Inuit organizations like NTI with respect to language, culture and social policy. These duties might be handled directly by NTI or by Designated Inuit Organizations. The NLCA brings many rights and benefits to Inuit. The NLCA recognizes the contributions of Inuit to Canada’s history, identity and sovereignty in the Arctic.\n\nOnce the NLCA was signed and became law in Canada, Tungavik Federation of Nunavut TFN transformed into NTI. NTI was created to ensure that all 42 Articles of the NLCA were implemented. NTI continues to implement those articles today. NTI also works to protect the rights and benefits of Inuit as outlined in the NLCA.\n\nNTI has an eight-member Board of Directors that guides the organization. The Board of Directors includes the NTI president, vice-president, and the presidents and vice-presidents of the three Regional Inuit Associations. NTI’s president and vice-president each hold office for a four-year term. NTI also has a five-member executive committee. The president and vice-president of NTI and the presidents of the three RIAs make up the executive committee. Approximately 75 people work for NTI in Cambridge Bay, Rankin Inlet, Iqaluit and Ottawa. Most of NTI’s employees are Inuit. NTI’s executive officers, board of directors and employees all work toward ensuring the NLCA is implemented. \n\nNunavut \"our land\" in Inuktut, is a territory with a public government and the homeland of Inuit in Canada's eastern Arctic. In 1993 a Nunavut-wide Inuit vote and the Canadian Parliament ratified the Nunavut Agreement. By April 1, 1999, when the Government of Nunavut and the Nunavut Territory was created, it represented the \"largest comprehensive land claim settlement ever reached between a state and its Indigenous Peoples.\" \n\nBy the late 1960s, young Inuit men and women were graduating from high schools and vocational training in Churchill, Manitoba, Whitehorse, Yukon, and Ottawa where they had opportunities to meet with other young people from different regions to discuss common problems and consider political change. As a result these young graduates founded two organizations in 1970. The Committee for Original Peoples’ Entitlement (COPE) was established in the western Arctic in response to exploratory oil seismic work on Banks Island in October, 1970 that threatened the subsistence of local trappers. In the eastern Arctic, the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada (ITK) was founded in 1971. In 1973, the ITK initiated the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project which used land use mapping or counter-mapping methodologies, resulting in a three volume publication, based on research by a team of experts working closely with Inuit across Canada. According to Milton Freeman who oversaw the project, it \"documented the total Inuit land use area of the Northwest Territories, then stretching from the Mackenzie River to east Baffin Island,\" to provide \"information in support of the fact that Inuit have used and occupied this vast northern land since time immemorial and that they still use and occupy it to this day.\" Hugh Brody worked on the project from 1976–78 as coordinator in the North Baffin region. He also assembled an Arctic-wide account of Inuit perceptions of land occupancy, building a collage of Inuit voices from all the communities of the Northwest Territories.\n\nIn the 1979 case \"Baker Lake v. Minister of Indian Affairs\" the plaintiffs, the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada (ITK) and the Baker Lake Hunters and Trappers Association from Baker Lake, concerned that \"government-licensed exploration companies were interfering with their aboriginal rights, specifically, their right to hunt caribou\" took the Minister of Indian Affairs before the Federal Court of Canada. Justice Mahoney recognized the existence of Aboriginal Title in Nunavut.\n\nA September 5, 2018 report \"Raising children\" by the University of Calgary based Children First Canada and the O'Brien Institute for Public Health, wrote that Nunavut had the highest infant mortality rate (IMR) in Canada — 17.7 per 1,000 live births, much higher than the Canadian average IMR of 4.7. The president of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, Aluki Kotierk, said she hoped this would \"spark rage\" at the dire living conditions of some Nunavummiut children. The report, which provided a snapshot of the health and well-being of Canadian children based on data collected by Statistics Canada, the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), the Canadian Pediatric Society, UNICEF report cards and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports, warned that Canada's IMR was higher than all other European OECD countries and compared to all OECD countries, Canada ranks 30th of 44.\n\n"}

It also reached the top 10 in several other countries, including Canada, France, Iceland and Norway. At the 1996 Grammy Awards, it won awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.\n\n\"Kiss from a Rose\" was written in 1987, several years prior to the release of Seal's eponymous debut album from 1991. After writing the song, Seal felt \"embarrassed by it\" and \"threw the tape in the corner.\" Seal did not present it to producer Trevor Horn until the recording sessions for \"Seal II\". In 2015, Seal said of the song: \"To be honest, I was never really that proud of it, though I like what Trevor did with the recording.

Anosov systems are a special case of Axiom A systems.\n\nAnosov diffeomorphisms were introduced by Dmitri Victorovich Anosov, who proved that their behaviour was in an appropriate sense \"generic\" (when they exist at all).\n\nThree closely related definitions must be distinguished:\n\nA classical example of Anosov diffeomorphism is the Arnold's cat map.\n\nAnosov proved that Anosov diffeomorphisms are structurally stable and form an open subset of mappings (flows) with the \"C\" topology.\n\nNot every manifold admits an Anosov diffeomorphism; for example, there are no such diffeomorphisms on the sphere . The simplest examples of compact manifolds admitting them are the tori: they admit the so-called linear Anosov diffeomorphisms, which are isomorphisms having no eigenvalue of modulus 1. It was proved that any other Anosov diffeomorphism on a torus is topologically conjugate to one of this kind.\n\nThe problem of classifying manifolds that admit Anosov diffeomorphisms turned out to be very difficult, and still has no answer. The only known examples are infranil manifolds, and it is conjectured that they are the only ones.\n\nA sufficient condition for transitivity is that all points are nonwandering: formula_1.\n\nAlso, it is unknown if every formula_2 volume-preserving Anosov diffeomorphism is ergodic. Anosov proved it under a formula_3 assumption. It is also true for formula_4 volume-preserving Anosov diffeomorphisms.\n\nFor formula_3 transitive Anosov diffeomorphism formula_6 there exists a unique SRB measure (the acronym stands for Sinai, Ruelle and Bowen) formula_7 supported on formula_8 such that its basin formula_9 is of full volume, where \n\nAs an example, this section develops the case of the Anosov flow on the tangent bundle of a Riemann surface of negative curvature. This flow can be understood in terms of the flow on the tangent bundle of the Poincaré half-plane model of hyperbolic geometry. Riemann surfaces of negative curvature may be defined as Fuchsian models, that is, as the quotients of the upper half-plane and a Fuchsian group. For the following, let \"H\" be the upper half-plane; let Γ be a Fuchsian group; let \"M\" = \"H\"/Γ be a Riemann surface of negative curvature as the quotient of \"M\" by the action of the group Γ, and let formula_11 be the tangent bundle of unit-length vectors on the manifold \"M\", and let formula_12 be the tangent bundle of unit-length vectors on \"H\". Note that a bundle of unit-length vectors on a surface is the principal bundle of a complex line bundle.\n\nOne starts by noting that formula_12 is isomorphic to the Lie group PSL(2,R). This group is the group of orientation-preserving isometries of the upper half-plane. The Lie algebra of PSL(2,R) is sl(2,R), and is represented by the matrices\n\nwhich have the algebra\n\nThe exponential maps\n\ndefine right-invariant flows on the manifold of formula_17, and likewise on formula_18. Defining formula_19 and formula_20, these flows define vector fields on \"P\" and \"Q\", whose vectors lie in \"TP\" and \"TQ\". These are just the standard, ordinary Lie vector fields on the manifold of a Lie group, and the presentation above is a standard exposition of a Lie vector field.\n\nThe connection to the Anosov flow comes from the realization that formula_21 is the geodesic flow on \"P\" and \"Q\". Lie vector fields being (by definition) left invariant under the action of a group element, one has that these fields are left invariant under the specific elements formula_21 of the geodesic flow. In other words, the spaces \"TP\" and \"TQ\" are split into three one-dimensional spaces, or subbundles, each of which are invariant under the geodesic flow. The final step is to notice that vector fields in one subbundle expand (and expand exponentially), those in another are unchanged, and those in a third shrink (and do so exponentially).\n\nMore precisely, the tangent bundle \"TQ\" may be written as the direct sum \n\nor, at a point formula_24, the direct sum\n\ncorresponding to the Lie algebra generators \"Y\", \"J\" and \"X\", respectively, carried, by the left action of group element \"g\", from the origin \"e\" to the point \"q\". That is, one has formula_26 and formula_27. These spaces are each subbundles, and are preserved (are invariant) under the action of the geodesic flow; that is, under the action of group elements formula_28.\n\nTo compare the lengths of vectors in formula_29 at different points \"q\", one needs a metric. Any inner product at formula_30 extends to a left-invariant Riemannian metric on \"P\", and thus to a Riemannian metric on \"Q\". The length of a vector formula_31 expands exponentially as exp(t) under the action of formula_21. The length of a vector formula_33 shrinks exponentially as exp(-t) under the action of formula_21. Vectors in formula_35 are unchanged. This may be seen by examining how the group elements commute. The geodesic flow is invariant,\n\nbut the other two shrink and expand:\n\nand \n\nwhere we recall that a tangent vector in formula_39 is given by the derivative, with respect to \"t\", of the curve formula_40, the setting formula_41.\n\nWhen acting on the point formula_42 of the upper half-plane, formula_21 corresponds to a geodesic on the upper half plane, passing through the point formula_42. The action is the standard Möbius transformation action of SL(2,R) on the upper half-plane, so that \n\nA general geodesic is given by\n\nwith \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" and \"d\" real, with formula_47. The curves formula_48 and formula_40 are called horocycles. Horocycles correspond to the motion of the normal vectors of a horosphere on the upper half-plane.\n\n\n"}

One of the major goals of these approaches is to provide a reliable solution (or an accurate approximation) of the quantum many-body problem. The diverse flavor of quantum Monte Carlo approaches all share the common use of the Monte Carlo method to handle the multi-dimensional integrals that arise in the different formulations of the many-body problem. The quantum Monte Carlo methods allow for a direct treatment and description of complex many-body effects encoded in the wave function, going beyond mean field theory and offering an exact solution of the many-body problem in some circumstances. In particular, there exist numerically exact and polynomially-scaling algorithms to exactly study static properties of boson systems without geometrical frustration. For fermions, there exist very good approximations to their static properties and numerically exact exponentially scaling quantum Monte Carlo algorithms, but none that are both.\n\nIn principle, any physical system can be described by the many-body Schrödinger equation as long as the constituent particles are not moving \"too\" fast; that is, they are not moving at a speed comparable to that of light, and relativistic effects can be neglected. This is true for a wide range of electronic problems in condensed matter physics, in Bose–Einstein condensates and superfluids such as liquid helium. The ability to solve the Schrödinger equation for a given system allows prediction of its behavior, with important applications ranging from materials science to complex biological systems. The difficulty is however that solving the Schrödinger equation requires the knowledge of the many-body wave function in the many-body Hilbert space, which typically has an exponentially large size in the number of particles. Its solution for a reasonably large number of particles is therefore typically impossible, even for modern parallel computing technology in a reasonable amount of time. Traditionally, approximations for the many-body wave function as an antisymmetric function of one-body orbitals have been used, in order to have a manageable treatment of the Schrödinger equation. This kind of formulation has however several drawbacks, either limiting the effect of quantum many-body correlations, as in the case of the Hartree–Fock (HF) approximation, or converging very slowly, as in configuration interaction applications in quantum chemistry.\n\nQuantum Monte Carlo is a way to directly study the many-body problem and the many-body wave function beyond these approximations. The most advanced quantum Monte Carlo approaches provide an exact solution to the many-body problem for non-frustrated interacting boson systems, while providing an approximate, yet typically very accurate, description of interacting fermion systems. Most methods aim at computing the ground state wavefunction of the system, with the exception of path integral Monte Carlo and finite-temperature auxiliary field Monte Carlo, which calculate the density matrix. In addition to static properties, the time-dependent Schrödinger equation can also be solved, albeit only approximately, restricting the functional form of the time-evolved wave function, as done in the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo. From the probabilistic point of view, the computation of the top eigenvalues and the corresponding ground states eigenfunctions associated with the Schrödinger equation relies on the numerical solving of Feynman–Kac path integration problems. The mathematical foundations of Feynman–Kac particle absorption models and their Sequential Monte Carlo and mean field interpretations are developed in.\n\nThere are several quantum Monte Carlo methods, each of which uses Monte Carlo in different ways to solve the many-body problem:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although Six Flags did not confirm the speculation, a first look at the park's new-ride layout from the Jackson Township zoning board meeting was posted on the \"JTown Magazine\" website and the layout was identical to that of Chang.\n\nOn September 16, Six Flags Great Adventure announced that it would open a Green Lantern-themed roller coaster in 2011. The specifications released for the new ride matched those of Chang. As part of the relocation, the ride would receive technical renovations and a new coat of paint.\n\nFooters were poured for the ride in December 2010, with track installation beginning the following month. In January 2011, construction of the lift hill was completed. In April 2011 the final pieces of track were put in place.\n\nOn May 19, Green Lantern soft-opened to a select group of season-pass holders, media and families from Children's Miracle Network. The ride opened to the public on May 25.\n\n\"Green Lantern\" is located in the Boardwalk section of the park. Green Lantern is the third roller coaster to occupy this plot of land, following the Sarajevo Bobsled (which ran at Great Adventure from 1984 to 1988 before moving to Six Flags Great America and Great Escape) and the Great American Scream Machine (an Arrow Dynamics looping coaster which had occupied this area from 1989 to 2010). Like the Great American Scream Machine, the infield of Green Lantern is covered with gravel. The coaster also reuses the Scream Machine's queue area building.\n\nGreen Lantern is Six Flags Great Adventure's fifth Bolliger & Mabillard roller coaster, joining , Bizarro, Nitro and . The coaster is the park's second standup coaster; the first was a smaller coaster manufactured by Intamin, Shockwave, which operated from 1990 to 1992. Shockwave had also been installed at Six Flags Magic Mountain, preceding Riddler's Revenge.\n\nAs its name suggests, Green Lantern is themed for the DC Comics character of the same name. The theme was chosen to coincide with the Green Lantern film scheduled for release in 2011. The track is painted green, with the exception of the yellow vertical loop. The second corkscrew was originally the track section which was going to be yellow, but it was decided to switch the scheme to the first loop. The loop is yellow because Green Lantern's enemy is the yellow Parallax. In June 2011, a Parallax cutout with clutching arms through which the train passes was placed at the bottom of the first drop. The ride's queue area features a series of comic-book-style boards relating the story of Hal Jordan (the Green Lantern) and the Green Lantern Corps.\n\nGreen Lantern currently operates with two steel-and-fiberglass trains. Each train has seven cars with four seats in a single row, for a total of 28 riders. Riders are secured by an over-the-shoulder harness. Green Lantern originally operated with three trains but the park later reduced operation to two trains due to the trains \"stacking\" on the brake run. Although Green Lantern is a stand-up roller coaster, there is a small bicycle seat on which riders can lean.\n\nThe first section of Green Lantern is basically a mirrored version of Rougarou at Cedar Point. Leaving the station, the train starts by climbing the chain lift hill, on which the Green Lantern oath is played over loudspeakers along the steps. At the top, the train goes through a pre-drop before making a slightly-banked 180° turnaround. After this, the train goes down a drop into a vertical loop. Out of the loop, the track rises to the right into a diving loop, hugging the first drop of . Riders then rise into a diving turnaround over the station, and the train enters a right-leaning inclined loop. After a small hill, the train then rises to the left into the mid-course brake run. It then drops into a clockwise corkscrew, turning right and weaving through the diving loop. The track then makes a ground-hugging left turn and enters a low, second clockwise corkscrew. After a right turn the train makes a final, 180° left turn into the final brake run before returning to the station. Green Lantern is long, with a ride taking about 2 minutes to complete.\n\nAt its opening, Chang claimed the record for the tallest vertical loop of any roller coaster in the world. At the time, it was the world's tallest, fastest and longest stand-up coaster. It also claimed records for the largest drop and the most inversions on a stand-up roller coaster. All of these records had eclipsed those set by Mantis, which opened at Cedar Point in 1996. In 1998 Riddler's Revenge opened at Six Flags Magic Mountain, surpassing each title held by Chang.\n\nAfter Chang's 1997 opening at Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom, the park saw a rise in attendance to a record of more than one million visitors. The previous record of about 730,000 was set in 1996. The ride was Kentucky Kingdom's marquee attraction.\n\nAfter the ride's relocation to Six Flags Great Adventure, Brady MacDonald of the \"Los Angeles Times\" ranked it 8 of the park's 13 roller coasters. Mekado Murphy of \"The New York Times\" highlighted the different forces at play on a stand-up roller coaster, compared with a traditional one: \"Other coasters create pressure mostly in your upper body; Green Lantern creates pressure in your legs, making them a much more active part of the experience\". Both \"JTown Magazine\" and \"The Star-Ledger\" interviewed a number of park guests and coaster enthusiasts when the Green Lantern opened; all gave favorable reviews.\n\n\n"}

It occurred just one month after the June 2005 Gujarat floods. The term \"26 July\", is now always used to refer to the day when the city of Mumbai came to a standstill due to flooding.\n\nMany people were stranded on the roads, lost their homes while many walked long distances back home from work that evening. The floods were caused by the eighth heaviest-ever recorded 24-hour rainfall figure of 944 mm (37.17 inches) which lashed the metropolis on 26 July 2005, and intermittently continued for the next day. 644mm (25.35 inches) was received within the 12-hour period between 8 am and 8 pm. Torrential rainfall continued for the next week. The highest 24-hour period in India was 1,168 mm (46.0 inches) in Aminidivi in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep on 6 May 2004 although some reports suggest that it was a new Indian record. The previous record high rainfall in a 24-hour period for Mumbai was 575 mm (22.6 inches) in 1974.\n\nOther places severely affected were Raigad, Chiplun and Khed.\nOn 26 July 2005, around 2:00 pm, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region was struck by a severe storm and subsequent deluge. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) station in Santacruz recorded 944.22 mm\n\nLocal train movement came to a halt by 2:30 p.m. due to the water-logging on the tracks. This caused traffic on roads to increase dramatically with water logging and submerging of certain low-lying pockets of the region, such as Dharavi and Bandra-Kurla Complex.\n\nThousands of school children were stranded due to flooding and could not reach home for up to 24 hours. The following two days were declared as school and college holidays by the state government.\nThe rain water caused the sewage system to overflow and all water lines were contaminated. The Government ordered all housing societies to add chlorine to their water tanks .\n\nThe financial cost of floods was unprecedented and these floods caused a stoppage of entire commercial, trading, and industrial activity for days. Preliminary indications indicate that the floods caused a direct loss of about ₹5.50 billion (€80 million or US$100 million). The financial impact of the floods were manifested in a variety of ways:\n\n\n\n\nThe present storm-water drainage system in Mumbai was put in place in the early 20th century and is capable of carrying only 25.1237 millimetres of water per hour which was extremely inadequate on a day when 993 mm of rain fell in the city. The drainage system was also clogged at several places.\n\nOnly 3 'outfalls' (ways out to the sea) are equipped with floodgates whereas the remaining 102 open directly into the sea for more than 24 hours. As a result, there is no way to stop the seawater from rushing into the drainage system during high tide.\n\nIn 1990, an ambitious plan was drawn to overhaul the city's storm water drainage system which had never been reviewed in over 50 years. A project costing approximately 6 billion rupees was proposed by UK based consultants hired by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to study the matter. Implementation of the project would have ensured that rainwater did not flood the streets of Mumbai. The project was planned to have completed by 2002 and aimed to enhance the drainage system through larger diameter storm water drains and pipes, using pumps wherever necessary and removing encroachments. The project, if implemented would have doubled the storm water carrying capacity to 50 mm per hour.\n\nThe BMC committee had rejected the proposed project on the grounds that it was \"too costly\". These were few of the drawbacks due to which the city suffered so gravely.\n\nDevelopment in certain parts of Mumbai is haphazard and buildings are constructed without proper planning. The drainage plans in northern suburbs is chalked out as and when required in a particular area and not from an overall point of view.\n\nThe Environment Ministry of the Government of India was informed in the early 1990s that sanctioning the Bandra-Kurla complex (a commercial complex in northern Mumbai) was leading to disaster. No environment clearance is mandatory for large urban construction projects in northern Mumbai. Officials in the environment ministry claimed that it was not practical to impose new guidelines with retrospective effect \"as there are millions of buildings\".\n\nMangrove ecosystems which exist along the Mithi River and Mahim Creek are being destroyed and replaced with construction. Hundreds of acres of swamps in Mahim creek have been reclaimed and put to use for construction by builders. These ecosystems serve as a buffer between land and sea. It is estimated that Mumbai has lost about 40% of its mangroves between 1995 and 2005, some to builders and some to encroachment (slums). Sewage and garbage dumps have also destroyed mangroves. The Bandra-Kurla complex in particular was created by replacing such swamps. The most acclaimed Mindspace CBD (INORBIT MALL) in Goregaon & Malad has been built by destroying a large patch of mangroves in Maharashtra.\n\n1) The disaster was featured in a National Geographic Documentary.\n\n2) Tum Mile - A 2009 Indian Hindi drama film, set against the backdrop of the disaster.\n\nThe floods have been the subject of research by scientists and social scientists attempting to understand the causes, impacts, and short/long term consequences. Scholars have studied the floods in Mumbai from the perspectives of climate change, disaster management / mitigation, urban health, vulnerability and adaptation, hydrology, environmental degradation and encroachment etc. Kapil Gupta (2007) assesses urban flood resilience, while Andharia (2006) contrasts the \"widespread acts of generosity and altruism\" in Mumbai with the general social disorder that was seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Aromar Revi (2005) draws lessons from the floods for prioritising multi-hazard risk mitigation. Parthasarathy (2009) links social and environmental insecurities to show that the most marginalised groups were also the most affected by the floods.\n\nClimate change has played an important role in causing large-scale floods across central India, especially the Mumbai floods of 2005. During 1901–2015, there has been a three-fold rise in widespread extreme rainfall events, over the entire central belt of India from Mumbai to Bhubaneshwar, leading to a steady rise in the number of flash floods. The rising number of extreme rain events are attributed to an increase in the fluctuations of the monsoon westerly winds, due to increased warming in the Arabian Sea. This results in occasional surges of moisture transport from the Arabian Sea to the subcontinent, resulting in widespread heavy rains lasting for 2–3 days. The Mumbai 2005 floods also occurred due to moisture surge from the Arabian Sea, and the heavy rains were not confined to Mumbai but spread over a large region across central India.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2320157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320157", "title": "Beryl Cook", "text": "Beryl Cook\n\nBeryl Cook, OBE (10 September 192628 May 2008) was a British artist best known for her original and instantly recognisable paintings. Often comical, her works pictured people whom she encountered in everyday life, including people enjoying themselves in pubs, girls shopping or out on a hen night, drag queen shows or a family picnicking by the seaside or abroad. She had no formal training and did not take up painting until her thirties. She was a shy and private person, and in her art often depicted the flamboyant and extrovert characters she would have liked to have been.\n\nCook admired the work of the English visionary artist Stanley Spencer, his influence evident in her compositions and bold bulky figures. Another influence was Edward Burra, who painted sleazy cafés, nightclubs, gay bars, sailors and prostitutes, although, unlike Burra, she did not paint the sinister aspects of scenes. She had an almost photographic memory. Although widely popular and recognized as one of the most well-known contemporary British artists, Cook never enjoyed acceptance by the art establishment.\n\nSince her death in 2008, Beryl's son John and granddaughter Sophie have run the official Beryl Cook website providing a look into the life of Beryl Cook.\n\nBeryl was born in Egham, Surrey, as one of four sisters. Her parents, Adrian S. B. Lansley and Ella Farmer-Francis, separated very early and her mother moved to Reading, Berkshire with her daughters. Beryl attended Kendrick School there, but left education at fourteen and started to work in a variety of jobs. Having moved to London towards the end of the war, Beryl attempted working as a model and showgirl. In 1948, she married her childhood friend John Cook, who was in the merchant navy. When he retired from the sea, they briefly ran a pub in Stoke-by-Nayland, Suffolk. Their son John was born in 1950, and in 1956, the family left to live in Southern Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe). They would remain in Africa for the next decade, where in 1960, Cook produced her first painting, \"Hangover\".\n\nThe family returned to England in the mid-sixties and moved to East Looe, Cornwall in 1965, where Beryl focused more on her painting. They then moved to Plymouth in 1968, where they bought a guest house on the Hoe. Cook shared her time between running the guest house and producing more and more paintings. In the mid-seventies, her works caught the attention of one of their guests, who subsequently put her in touch with the management of the Plymouth Arts Centre, where her first exhibition took place in November 1975. The exhibition was a great success and resulted in a cover feature in \"The Sunday Times\". This was followed by an exhibition at the Portal Gallery in London in 1976, where Cook continued to exhibit regularly until her death.\n\nCook was enjoying growing popularity and her paintings soon were in great demand. Her first book of collected works was published by John Murray in 1978, and in 1979, a film was made for LWT's \"The South Bank Show\", where she discussed her work with Melvyn Bragg. Cook then collaborated with such authors as Edward Lucie-Smith and Nanette Newman by providing illustrations for their books. She continued to regularly publish books of her own artworks up into the early 2000s, including \"Beryl Cook's New York\" (1985), inspired by her visit to the New York City.\n\nIn 1994, she received the Best Selling Published Artist Award from the Fine Art Trade Guild. In 1995, Beryl Cook was awarded the Order of the British Empire. She did not attend the official ceremony due to her shyness, and accepted the honour at a quieter ceremony in Plymouth the following year. Post Office reproduced one of her paintings as a first class postage stamp. In 2002, her painting \"The Royal Couple\" featured in the Golden Jubilee exhibition in London. Tiger Aspect Productions made two animated films called \"Bosom Pals\" using characters from her paintings, voiced by Dawn French, Rosemary Leach, Alison Steadman and Timothy Spall, and broadcast in February 2004. Channel 4 News produced a short film on Beryl and her work in 2005, and she was also the featured artist in BBC Two's \"The Culture Show\" in 2006.\n\nBeryl Cook died on 28 May 2008 at her home in Plymouth. Peninsula Arts of the Plymouth University mounted a major retrospective exhibition in November that year. Two books devoted to the artist were subsequently released, \"Beryl Cook 1926-2008\" and \"The World of Beryl Cook\". In 2010, two of her paintings were used as part of the \"Rude Britannia\" exhibition at the Tate Britain. Beryl Cook's paintings have been acquired by the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow, Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, Plymouth Art Gallery and Durham Museum.\n\n\n"}

A native of Colony, Oklahoma, he threw and batted left-handed, and was listed as tall and .\n\nMitchell was a standout at the University of Oklahoma from 1942 to 1946, with a career batting average of .467 and a senior season average of .507. Both marks are still Sooner records.\n\nMainly a line drive hitter to all parts of the field, Mitchell hit .432 in 11 games for the Indians in his rookie season in 1946. He became a regular in 1947 and hit .300 or better six of the next seven seasons.\n\nIn 1948, Mitchell hit for a career-high .336 average, had 203 hits, led the league in singles (162), and led the Indians to victory in the 1948 World Series. He finished third in the 1948 American League batting race behind Ted Williams (.369) and Lou Boudreau (.355).\n\nIn 1949, Mitchell led the AL in hits (203), singles (161) and triples (23), struck out only 11 times in 640 at-bats, and made his first appearance in the All-Star Game. He received his second All-Star nod in 1952, and in 1954 led the Indians to an AL record 111 wins in a 154-game season and the American League pennant.\n\nMitchell posted a career .312 batting average, 41 home runs and 403 RBIs in eleven seasons in major league baseball. For the period between 1943 and 1960, only Williams and Stan Musial hit for higher averages. A good contact hitter as well, he struck out only 119 times in 3,984 at-bats and received 346 walks, for an outstanding 2.91 walk-to-strikeout ratio, the eighth best ratio in major league history. He compiled a .985 fielding percentage in the majors.\n\nMitchell played for the Cleveland Indians in all but 19 of the 1127 regular-season games in which he appeared. Near the end of the 1956 season, the Brooklyn Dodgers purchased Mitchell's contract from Cleveland.\n\nMitchell is perhaps best remembered, however unfairly, for making the final out in Don Larsen's perfect game during the 1956 World Series for the New York Yankees against Mitchell's new team, the Dodgers. Mitchell, pinch-hitting for Brooklyn pitcher Sal Maglie, took a called third strike to end the only perfect game in Series history. Mitchell, who is tied for seventh place as one of the all-time toughest hitters to strike out (34-1 ratio), always maintained that the third strike he took was really a ball.\n\nIn his final at-bat as a big leaguer, he grounded out pinch-hitting in Game Seven of the Series, which the Yankees won.\n\nDale Mitchell died in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1987 at the age of 65. The L. Dale Mitchell Baseball Park at the University of Oklahoma is named in his honor.\n\n\n"}

His father, Joe, was born in 1939 at Rapid Lake to Basil, a trapper and fishing guide, who was later killed in France in 1945 during the Second World War, and Marie-Antoinette Marchand, who was part-French. At the age of nine Joe was sent to a residential school in Spanish, Ontario. The registration number he was given at the school, 29, was later used by Odjick during his playing career. Odjick was the fourth child and only son of six children for Joe and Giselle, after Debbie, Shelley, Judy and ahead of Janique and Dina; there were also several foster children raised by the Odjicks, at least 32. Originally named Wayne, Odjick was soon given a new name, Gino, as the family found out there was another Wayne on the reserve.\n\nFrom an early age Odjick played hockey, but it was not until he was 11 that he joined an organized team, which would be managed by Joe. He played in the 1983 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Maniwaki. Until he was 15 Odjick stayed with local teams that mainly played other teams from reserves, often coached by his father. At that age, considering quitting hockey to pursue other activities, Odjick accepted a try-out for the Hawkesbury Hawks, a Tier II junior team from Ontario; though he had been a defensive defenceman until that point, Odjick soon realised that his skills were not good enough, and instead became an enforcer. It was while in Hawkesbury that Odjick was first given the nickname \"the Algonquin Assassin,\" a reference to his heritage and skills as a fighter.\n\nHe credited his sense of defending his team and fighting skills in part due to racial tensions between natives of the reserve and nearby townspeople.\n\nGino Odjick was drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in the fifth round (86th overall) in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft. His primary role with the Canucks was as an enforcer. For part of his time in Vancouver, he played on a line with the high scoring Pavel Bure. For the 1993–94 NHL season, Odjick had a career high of 16 goals and 13 assists for 29 points. He played in a total of 8 seasons for the Canucks from 1990–91 to 1997–98. During six of those seasons, he had over 200 penalty minutes and twice he had over 300. His sixth season (1997–98) with over 200 penalty minutes was split between the Canucks (181 penalty minutes in 35 games) and New York Islanders (31 in 13 games).\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, Odjick was traded to the New York Islanders and played there until 1999–2000 when he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers. He left Philadelphia during the 2000–01 for the Montreal Canadiens. His last NHL season was with Montreal in 2001–02. He missed most of the 2002–03 season due to concussion from a puck hitting him in the back of the head during pre-season practice, and was subsequently suspended in February 2003 by the Canadiens for failure to report to the minor-league AHL team in Utah. He retired from professional hockey thereafter, his last known organized hockey coming in 2005, when he played on the Horse Lake Thunder team featuring several hired ringers, including ex-NHLers Theo Fleury, Sasha Lakovic and Dody Wood, which made it to the semi-finals of the 2005 Allan Cup.\n\nIn 2003, Odjick moved back to Vancouver and partnered with the Musqueam First Nation to manage the Musqueam Golf & Learning Academy. As of 2013 Gino still resides in Vancouver.\n\nOdjick starred in the 2014 Canadian short film \"Ronny Nomad and the Legendary Napkins of Wood\" written and produced by Adrian Patterson.\n\nOn June 26, 2014, Odjick revealed that he was diagnosed with the rare terminal disease AL amyloidosis. Al amyloidosis is a rare blood disorder and its exact cause is often unknown, according to Dr. Diego Delgado, a cardiologist at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre. This condition had slowly been hardening his heart by coating it in abnormal protein deposits, which eventually led to Odjick suffering a heart attack. He received the Indspire Award in the sports category in 2015. Despite being given just months to live, Odjick turned to an experimental new treatment for his illness. The experimental treatment appeared to have worked, and Odjick's condition is no longer considered terminal.\n"}

It is located near Guildford along the A246 between East Clandon and West Horsley. Hatchlands Park has been a Grade I listed property since 1967. The gardens were Grade II listed in 2007.\n\nThe park initially belonged to the Chertsey Abbey with the park being mentioned in the Domesday Book. In 1544, after the dissolution of the monasteries, it was granted by Henry VIII to Sir Anthony Browne and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Fitzgerald ('The Fair Geraldine' of Henry Howard). The first visual record of the park is shown on a John Seller map of 1693.\n\nThe park was purchased in 1750 by Admiral Edward Boscawen who landscaped the grounds; for the house he employed the architect Stiff Leadbetter. Edward Boscawen's widow, Fanny sold the estate in 1770 to the Sumner family of the East India Company; both father and son made further alterations to the property. The father, William Brightwell Sumner commissioned Benjamin Armitage to make alterations, and his son, George Holme Sumner asked Humphry Repton (1752–1818) to redesign the park and garden. Towards the end of the century, Joseph Bonomi, ARA, was commissioned to alter several rooms and to impose a frontispiece on the west front.\n\nIn 1888, the Sumner family sold the estate to Stuart Rendel, later Lord Rendel. He had extensive changes made to the fabric of the house. Rendel was mainly his own architect but he also employed his nephew by marriage, Halsey Ricardo, and commissioned Reginald Blomfield to build the Music Room. Rendel coloured and gilded Adam's ceilings, embellished the staircase with rococo decorations and switched the main entrance of the house to the east. Rendel also commissioned Gertrude Jekyll to design the gardens which contain a parterre. Lord Rendel's grandson, Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel, who was an architect and British Army officer, inherited the house in 1913. He passed the estate to the National Trust in 1945.\n\nThe house is open to the public, but closed on certain days of the week. However, the Parkland is now open 363 days a year. There is a café and a shop. There is a cobbled courtyard.\n\nThe house contains splendid interiors by Robert Adam, decorated in appropriately nautical style: anchors, cannon, dolphins and sea-nymphs are presided over by Neptune himself run through the house reflecting its first owner Edward Boscawen.\n\nThe house is home to the Cobbe Collection; with forty two historic keyboard instruments it is the world's largest group of its kind. Many of the instruments are associated with famous composers. The instruments include harpsichords and fortepianos dating from 1750 to 1840 - including an Erard pianoforte reputedly made for Marie Antoinette. It is one of the few French instruments of the time to escape destruction for firewood following the 1789 revolution. The pieces were brought together to represent those instrument makers who were highly regarded or patronised by composers, rather than to illustrate a complete or technical history of keyboard manufacture. Twelve of the instruments were actually owned or played by great composers such as Purcell, J. C. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, Mahler and Elgar.\n\nHatchlands also houses part of the Cobbe collection of paintings, including what is believed to be one of only two surviving portraits of William Shakespeare painted during his lifetime.\n\n"}

Neighbouring villages include West Clandon and West Horsley.\n\nIn 2011 it had a population of 268 in 109 households clustered around three buildings, the church of St Thomas of Canterbury, \"The Queen's Head\" pub and the village hall. Centred east of Guildford, the parish landscape includes a large farm and Hatchlands Park, a similar but National Trust estate and including a great mansion, which replaced the manor house. There are arable and livestock farmland and woodlands along the North Downs and a golf course in East Clandon.\n\nThe word Clandon (first recorded as Clanedune) goes back to Anglo-Saxon times, meaning \"clean down\" (open downland) from the North Downs hills that rise to the south of the village. People settled here due to the availability of water that emerged where the high chalk downs meet the lower lying clay to the north.\n\nChertsey Abbey, a Benedictine foundation, was patron of East Clandon from the Norman Conquest of 1066 to the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539. East Clandon appears in Domesday Book as \"Clanedun\". It was held by Chertsey Abbey. Its assets were then: 4 hides; 7 ploughs, woodland for 6 hogs. It rendered £6 per year to its overlords. In ancient documents the village is also often referred to as \"Clandon Abbatis\" (Abbot's Clandon). The church was built in the 12th and 13th centuries and is a Grade I listed building (the highest category). The main addition to it has been a bell tower added in 1900.\n\nIn 1544 Henry VIII granted East Clandon Manor to Sir Anthony Browne. The manor house, thought to have been close to where Hatchlands Park now is, was moated since times of unrest in the early 14th century. The house, and with it the village, changed hands many times during the next 200 years.\n\nThe oldest houses in the village, Frogmore Cottage, Lamp Cottage, Old Manor Farm, Tunmore Cottage among others, had already been built when the London brewer John Raymond sold the Hatchlands Park estate to Admiral Boscawen in 1749. The present Hatchlands House was built for him with the help of prize money from his victory over the French, and it was completed in 1758, only three years before the Admiral died.\n\nFrom 1768 the Sumner family owned the Hatchlands estate until it was bought at auction in 1888 by Lord Rendel. In 1913 his eldest daughter's son Captain Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel inherited the estate in trust. The captain was a professional architect and took a great interest in the village and its inhabitants. According to the writings of Maurice Wiggin, Goodhart-Rendel was a tall, spare, upright figure making his daily round in the village dressed in his grey tweed suit and soft brown trilby shouting to his dogs in a real Grenadier's voice. Every Christmas this 'squire' gave a children's tea party at Hatchlands, complete with Christmas tree and gifts for all comers. Christmas carol concerts are still held at Hatchlands for villagers today.\n\nSeveral houses in the village were built to his drawings, including Antler's Corner, Appletree Cottage, Meadow Cottage and 5 School Lane (1910), Prospect Cottages (1914), Snelgate Cottages (1926) and the St Thomas' Housing Society Cottages (1947).\n\nIn 1945 the Hatchlands house, park and some land were given to the National Trust. When Captain Goodhart-Rendel died in 1959 the estate passed into the hands of two relatives, a split he regarded with misgivings. Late 20th century owners, the Dunne-Ritche estate, sold most houses around 1970, but a few still remain in their possession.\n\nThe TV series \"Catweazle\" was shot in East Clandon (on Home Farm), West Horsley and the surrounding area in summer 1969.

{"id": "2320224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320224", "title": "Nipmuc", "text": "Nipmuc\n\nThe Nipmuc or Nipmuck people are descendants of the indigenous Algonquian peoples of \"Nippenet\", 'the freshwater pond place', which corresponds to central Massachusetts and immediately adjacent portions of Connecticut and Rhode Island. The tribe were first encountered by Europeans in 1630, when John Acquittamaug arrived with maize to sell to the starving colonists of Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nThe colonists introduced pathogens, such as smallpox, to which the Native Americans had no prior exposure. They were also exposed to alcohol for the first time, which led to huge numbers of natives succumbing to the effects of alcoholism. With the passage of increasingly harsh laws against Indian culture and religion, the loss of land, legally and illegally, to growing English colonies, many of the Nipmuc joined Metacomet's rebellion in 1675, the results of which were disastrous. Many of the Nipmuc were interned on Deer Island in Boston Harbor and perished, and others were executed or sold into slavery in the West Indies.\n\nThe Reverend John Eliot arrived in Boston in 1631 and began an ambitious project to learn the Massachusett language, widely understood throughout New England, convert the Native Americans, and published a Bible and grammar of the language. His efforts, with colonial government backing, established several 'Indian plantations' or 'Praying towns'—predecessors to the Indian Reservation—where the Native Americans were coerced to settle and instructed in English customs, Christianity, but governed and preached to by other Native Americans and in their own dialects. By the 19th century, the Nipmuc were reduced to wards of the state that were administered by state-appointed commissioners. The passage of the Massachusetts Enfranchisement Act of 1869 effectively 'detribalised' the Nipmuc, and the last of the remaining Indian plantation lands were sold. Nipmuc communities continued to survive, and the tribe received state recognition in 1979, but efforts at federal recognition have not yet met with success.\n\nThe tribe is first mentioned in a 1631 letter by Deputy Governor Thomas Dudley as the \"Nipnet\", 'people of the freshwater pond' due the inland location. This derives from \"Nippenet\" and includes variants such as \"Neipnett\", \"Neepnet\", \"Nepmet\", \"Nibenet\", \"Nopnat\" and \"Nipneet\". In 1637, Roger Williams records the tribe as the \"Neepmuck\", which derives from \"Nipamaug\", 'people of the freshwater fishing place,' and also appears as \"Neetmock\", \"Notmook\", \"Nippimook\", \"Nipmaug\", \"Nipmoog,\" \"Neepemut\", \"Nepmet\", \"Nepmock,\" \"Neepmuk\" as well as modern \"Nipmuc(k)\". Colonists and the Native Americans themselves used this term extensively after the growth of the Praying towns. The French referred to most New England Native Americans as \"Loup\", 'the Wolf People,' but the name \"ȣmiskanȣakȣiak\", the 'beaver tail-hill people,' was recorded as self-appellation of Nipmuc refugees that had fled to French Colonial Canada amongst the Abenaki.\n\nNipmucs probably spoke Loup A, a Southern New England Algonquian language.\n\nDaniel Gookin, Superintendent to the Native Americans and assistant of Eliot, was careful to distinguish the Nipmuc (proper), Wabquasset, Quaboag and Nashaway tribes. The situation was fluid since Native Americans unhappy with their chiefs were free to join other groups, and shifting alliances were made based on kinship, military, and tributary relationships with other tribes. The formation of the Praying towns broke tribal divisions as the Native Americans were settled together, but four groups that are associated with the Nipmuc peoples survive today:\n\nChaubunagungamaug Nipmuck or Dudley Indians\n\nHassanamisco Nipmuc or Grafton Indians\n\nNatick Massachusett or Natick Nipmuc\n\nConnecticut Nipmuc\n\nGovernor Michael Dukakis issued Executive Order #126 which proclaimed that 'State agencies shall deal directly with ... [the] Nipmuc ... on matters affecting the Nipmuc Tribe' as well as calling for the creation of a state 'Commission on Indian Affairs.' The subsequent establishment of the all-Indian Commission conferred state support for education, health care, cultural continuity, and protection of remaining lands for the descendants of the Wampanoag, Nipmuc and Massachusett tribes. The state also calls for the examination of all human remains and to notify the Commission, who after the investigation of the State Archaeologist, decide the appropriate course of action.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts also cited the continuity of the Nipmuc(k) with the historic tribe and commended tribal efforts to preserve their culture and traditions. The state also symbolically repealed the General Court Act of 1675 that banned Native Americans from the City of Boston during King Philip's War. The tribe also works closely with the state to undergo various archaeological excavations and preservation campaigns. The tribe, in conjunction with the National Congress of American Indians were against the construction of the sewage treatment plant on Deer Island in Boston Harbor where many graves were desecrated by its construction, and annually hold a remembrance service for members of the tribe lost over the winter during their internment during King Philip's War and protest against the destruction of Indian gravesites.\n\n On 22 April 1980, Zara Cisco Brough, landowner of Hassanamessit, submitted a letter of intention to petition for federal recognition as a Native American tribe which would confer certain rights, including state-to-state relations with the United States Congress and other support and services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The Nipmuc, represented by just the Hassanamisco, were added to the Federal Register as Petitioner #69. Members of the Chaubunagungamaug joined the efforts. On 20 July 1984, the BIA received the petition letter from the 'Nipmuc Tribal Council Federal Recognition Committee' co-signed by Zara Cisco Brough and her successor, Walter A. Vickers, of the Hassanamisco and Edwin 'Wise Owl' W. Morse, Sr. of the Chaubunagungamaug. On 2 February 1995, the Branch of Acknowledgement and Research (BAR) of the BIA to Edwin W. Morse, Sr. declared Petitioner #69 ready for active consideration, and requested the tribal membership lists in follow-up letter later that May. By 11 July 1995, the Nipmuc were placed on 'active consideration.'\n\nPalaeo-Indians entered the region from the south-west during the retreat of the Wisconsin Glacier sometime around 9000 BC. Evidence includes various chert tools that have been uncovered at the Bull Run site in Ipswich, Massachusetts as well as various riverside excavation sites in central portions of the state. These early peoples hunted the tundra environment, probably in search of caribou and other game.\n\nThere was a great shift to more permanent hunting camps and expansion of tool making abilities. Fishing equipment, more advanced stone tools, burial culture, localised hunting, and development of stone bowls developed during the Archaic Period which began around 7000 BC. During this period, warmer weather would see forests develop and the extinction of the ice age megafauna. Settlements became more permanent and population densities increased.\n\nThe Woodland Period began with the local development of agriculture sometime around 1000 BC and would last until contact occurred in the 17th century Peoples during this period had adopted agriculture as well as slash-and-burn practices. This period would also see the adoption of ceramic pottery, introduction of the atlatl, and a culture that would have been recognisable to the later colonists. Populations increased and settlements became more permanent with the advent of agriculture. During the later stages of the period, pottery styles became influenced by Iroquois pottery styles and the bow and arrow were also adopted.\n\nDutch and English sailors and adventurers began visiting New England, although the first permanent settlements in the region began after the settling of Plymouth Colony in 1620. These early seafarers introduced several diseases to which the Native Americans had no prior contact, resulting in epidemics with mortality rates as high as 90%. Smallpox wiped out many of the Native Americans from 1617–1619, 1633, 1648–1649 and 1666. Influenza, typhus, and measles also afflicted the Native Americans throughout the period. The colonists, such as the writings of Increase Mather, attributed the decimation of the Native Americans to God's providence in clearing the new lands for settlement. The Nipmuc at the time of contact were a fairly large grouping, subject to their more powerful neighbours who provided protection, especially against the Pequot, Mohawk and Abenaki tribes that raided the area. The colonists depended initially on the Native Americans for survival in the New World, and the Native Americans rapidly began to trade their foodstuffs, furs and wampum for the copper kettles, arms and metal tools of the colonists. Puritan settlers arrived in large numbers from 1620–1640, the 'Great Migration' which increased pressure to procure more land. Since the colonists had conflicting colonial and royal grants, the settlers quickly depended on Indian names on land deeds to mark legitimacy. This backfired, as John Wampas deeded off many lands to the colonists to curry favour, many of which were not even his.\n\nThe royal Charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony of 1692 called for the conversion of the Native Americans. The English did not begin this in earnest until after the Pequot War proved their military superiority, with official backing in 1644. Although many answered the call, the Rev. John Eliot who had learned the language from Massachusett tribe interpreters compiled an Indian Bible and a grammar of the language that was well understood from Cape Ann to Connecticut. The experiment also began for the settlement of the Native Americans on the 'Indian plantations' or 'Praying towns'. The Native Americans were instructed in English farming methods, culture, language but administered by Indian preachers and councillors often descended from the chiefly families. The Native Americans melded Indian culture and English ways, but were mistrusted by both the colonists and their non-converted brethren. The remnants of the plantations were sold off, and by the end of the 19th century, only the Cisco homestead in Grafton remained in possession of direct descendants of Nipmuc landholders. List of Indian Plantations (Praying towns) associated with the Nipmuc:\nChaubunagungamaug, Chabanakongkomuk, Chaubunakongkomun, or Chaubunakongamaug\nHassanamesit, Hassannamessit, Hassanameset, or Hassanemasset\nMakunkokoag, Magunkahquog, Magunkook, Maggukaquog, or Mawonkkomuk\nManchaug, Manchauge, Mauchage, Mauchaug, or Mônuhchogok\nManexit, Maanexit, Mayanexit\nNashoba\nNatick\nOkommakamesitt, Agoganquameset, Ockoocangansett, Ogkoonhquonkames, Ognonikongquamesit, or Okkomkonimset\nPackachoag, Packachoog, Packachaug, Pakachog, or Packachooge\nQuabaug, Quaboag, Squaboag\nQuinnetusset, Quanatusset, Quantiske, Quantisset, or Quatiske, Quattissick\nWabaquasset, Wabaquassit, Wabaquassuck, Wabasquassuck, Wabquisset or Wahbuquoshish\nWacuntuc, Wacantuck, Wacumtaug, Wacumtung, Waentg, or Wayunkeke\nWashacum or Washakim\n\nThe Massachusetts Bay Colony passed numerous legislation against Indian culture and religion. New laws were passed to limit the influence of the powwows, or 'shamans', and restricted the ability of non-converted Native Americans to enter English towns on Sabbath. The Nipmuc were also informed that any unimproved lands were fair game for incorporation into the growing colony. These draconian measures and the increasing amount of land lost to the settlers led many Nipmuc to join the Wampanoag chief Metacomet in a rebellion against the English which would ravage New England from 1675–1676. The Native Americans that had already settled the Praying towns were interned on Deer Island in Boston Harbor over the winter where a great many perished from starvation and exposure to the elements. Although many of the Native Americans fled to join the uprising, other Native Americans joined the English. The Praying Indians were particularly at risk, as the war made all Native Americans suspect, but the Praying towns were also attacked by the 'wild' Native Americans that joined the rebellion. The Nipmuc were major participants in the siege of Lancaster, Brookfield, Sudbury and Bloody Brook, all in Massachusetts, and the tribe prepared thoroughly for conflict by forming alliances, and the group even had \"an experienced gunsmith, a lame man, who kept their weapons in good working order.\" The siege of Lancaster also lead to the capture of Mary Rowlandson, who was placed in captivity until ransomed for £20 and would later write a memoir of her captivity. The Native Americans lost the war, and survivors were hunted down, murdered, sold into slavery in the West Indies or forced to leave the area.\n\nThe Nipmuc regrouped around their former Praying towns and were able to maintain a certain amount of autonomy using the remaining lands to farm or sell timber. The population of the tribe was reduced as several outbreaks of smallpox returned in 1702, 1721, 1730, 1752, 1764, 1776 and 1792. Land sales continued unabated, much of it used to pay for legal fees, personal expenses, and improvements to the reserve lands. By 1727, Hassanamisset was reduced to 500 acres from the original 7,500 acres with that land incorporated into the town of Grafton, Massachusetts, and in 1797, Chaubunagungamaug Reserve was reduced to 26 of their 200 acres. The switch to the cattle industry also disrupted the native economy, as the colonists' cattle ate the unfenced lands of the Nipmuc and the courts did not always side with the Native Americans, but the Native Americans rapidly adopted the husbandry of swine since the changes in economy and loss of remaining pristine lands reduced ability to hunt and fish. Since the Native Americans had few assets besides land, much of the land was sold to pay for medical, legal and personal expenses, increasing the number of landless Native Americans. With smaller numbers and landholdings, Indian autonomy was worn away by the time of the Revolutionary War, the remaining reserve lands were overseen by colony- and later state-appointed guardians that were to act on the Native Americans' behalf. However, the Hassanamisco guardian Stephen Maynard, appointed in 1776, embezzled the funds and was never prosecuted.\n\nNew England rapidly became swept up in a series of wars between the French and English and their respective Indian allies. Many of the Native Americans of the New England had escaped to join the Abenaki and returned to fight against the English, however the local Native Americans were often conscripted as guides or scouts for the colonists. Wars occupied much of the century, including King William's War, (1689–1699), Queen Anne's War (1704–1713), Dummer's War (1722–1724), King George's War (1744–1748) and the French and Indian War (1754–1760). Many Native Americans also died in service of the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe upheaval of the Indian Wars and growing mistrust of the Native Americans by the colonists lead to a steady trickle, and sometimes whole villages, that fled to increasingly mixed-tribe bands either northward to the Pennacook and Abenaki who were under the protection of the French or westward to join the Mahican at increasingly mixed settlements of Schagticoke or Stockbridge, the latter of which eventually migrated as far west as Wisconsin. This further dwindled Indian presence in New England, although not all the Native Americans dispersed. Those Nipmuc that fled eventually assimilated into either the predominate host tribe or the conglomerate that developed.\n\nThe Native Americans were reduced to wards of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and continued to be represented by state-appointed guardians. Rapid acculturation and intermarriage led many to believe the Nipmuc had simply just vanished, due to a combination of romantic notions of who the Native Americans were and to justify the colonial expansion. Native Americans continued to exist but fewer and fewer were able to live on the dwindling reserve lands and most left to seek employment as domestics or servants in White households, out to sea as whalers or seafarers, or into the growing cities where they became labourers or barbers. Growing acculturation, intermarriage, and dwindling populations led to the extinction of the Natick Dialect of the Massachusett language, and only one speaker could be found in 1798. One of the traditional things that survived was the peddling of native square-edged splint baskets and medicines. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, after investigating the condition of the Native Americans, decided to grant citizenship to the Native Americans with the passage of the Massachusetts Enfranchisement Act of 1869, which ultimately led to the sale of any of the remaining lands. Hassanamessit was divided up among a few families. In 1897, the last of the Dudley lands were sold, and the remaining Native Americans were housed in the 'poor house' on Lake Street in Webster, Massachusetts.\n\nIntermarriage between Whites, Blacks or (\"Chikitis\"), and Native Americans began in early colonial times. Africans and Native Americans shared a complementary gender imbalance as few female slaves were imported into New England and many of the Indian men were lost to war or the whaling industry. Naturally, many unions between Native American women and African men occurred. Intermarriage with Whites was uncommon, due to colonial anti-miscegenation laws in place. The children of such unions were accepted into the tribe as Native Americans, due to the matrilineal focus of Nipmuc culture, but to the eyes of their sceptical White neighbours, the increasingly Black phenotypes delegitimised their Indian identity. By the 19th century, only a handful of pure-blood Native Americans remained, and Native Americans vanish from state and federal census records but are listed as 'Black', 'mulatto', 'colored' or 'miscellaneous' depending on their appearance.\n\nIn 1848, the Massachusetts Senate Joint Committee on Claims called for a report on the condition of several tribes that received aid from the Commonwealth. Three reports were listed: The 1848 'Denney Report' presented to the Senate the same year; the 1849 'Briggs Report', written by Commissioners F. W. Bird, Whiting Griswold and Cyrus Weekes and presented to Governor George N. Briggs; and the 1859 'Earle Report', written by Commissioner John Milton Earle that was submitted in 1861. Each report was more informative and thorough than the previous one. The Nipmuc require having an ancestor listed on these reports and the disbursement lists of funds from Nipmuc land sales. The lists did not count all Native Americans, as many Native Americans may have been well-integrated into other racial communities and due to the constant movement of Native Americans from place to place.\n\nAttitudes towards Native American culture and history changed as antiquarians, anthropologists, institutions like the Boy Scouts as well as the 1907 appearance of Buffalo Bill Cody with many Native Americans in feathered headresses paying respects to Uncas, Sachem of the Mohegan. Despite the nearly four centuries of assimilation, acculturation, and the destruction of economic and community support from enfranchisement, certain Indian families were able to maintain a distinct Indian identity and cultural identity. The turn of the century also saw active cultural and genealogical research by James L. Cisco and his daughter Sara Cisco Sullivan from the Grafton homestead, and worked closely with the remnants of other closely related tribes, such as Gladys Tantaquidgeon and the Fielding families of the Mohegan Tribe, Atwood L. Williams of the Pequot, and William L. Wilcox of the Narragansett. Together, various tribal members began sharing cultural memory, with pan-Indianism firmly taking root in the 1920s with Indian gatherings such as the Algonquin Indian Council of New England that met in Providence, Rhode Island and dances or pow-wows such as those at Hassanamessit in 1924. Plains Indian costume was often worn as potent statements of Indian identity and to prove their continued residence in the area and because much of the original culture had been lost. Other Nipmuc individuals appeared at town pageants and fairs, including the 1938 appearance at the Sturbridge, Massachusetts bicentennial fair of many ancestors of today's Chaubunagungamaug Nipmuck.\n\nBy the 1970s, the Nipmuc had made many strides. Many local members of the tribe were called upon to help with the development of the Native American exhibit at Old Sturbridge Village, a 19th-century living museum built in the heart of former Nipmuc territory. State recognition was also achieved by the end of the same decade, re-establishing the Nipmuc people's relationship with the state and providing limited social services. The Nipmuc sought federal recognition in the 1980s. Tension between the Nipmuc Nation, which included the Hassanamisco and many descendants of the Chaubunagungamaug, based in Sutton, Massachusetts, and the rest of the Chaubunagungamaug, based in Webster, Massachusetts split the tribe in the mid-1990s. Divisions were caused by the frustrations with the slow pace of recognition as well as disagreements about gambling.\n\n190 acres of the Hassanamessit Woods in Grafton, believed to contain the remains of the praying village were under agreement for development for more than 100 homes. This property has significant cultural importance to the Nipmuc Tribal Nation because it is thought to contain the meetinghouse and the center of the old praying village. However, The Trust for Public Land, the town of Grafton, the Grafton Land Trust, the Nipmuc Nation and the state of Massachusetts intervened. The Trust for Public Land purchased the property and kept it off the market until 2004, after sufficient funding was procured to permanently protect the property. The property also has ecological significance as it is adjacent to 187 acres of Grafton owned land as well as 63 acres owned by the Grafton Land Trust. These properties will provide numerous recreational benefits to the public as well as play a role in protecting the water quality of local watersheds.\n\nIn July 2013, the Hassanamisco band selected a chief, Cheryll Toney Holley to succeed Walter Vickers upon his resignation.\n\n\n"}

Bate was a long time Ottawa musician (pedal steel guitar) who worked as a radio producer and as a computer games developer (working on such titles as B.C.'s Quest for Tires, , and Ace of Aces). He also worked as a reporter for Canadian Press.\n\nIn 1989, Bate became a business partner with David Bentley to expand \"Frank\" from its Halifax roots by launching an Ottawa edition. Bentley eventually returned to Halifax and, under Bate's direction, the Ottawa edition of \"Frank\" blossomed in the mid-1990s. Paid circulation of the magazine peaked at under 20,000 copies nationally but it earned a notoriety that far exceeded its readership. The magazine infuriated then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for a mock contest to \"deflower\" his daughter. Mulroney said in a television interview that he wanted to get a gun and \"do serious damage\" to Frank's editor. Bate defended the piece as an attempt to show that the unpopular prime minister was exploiting his daughter for political gain.\n\nSoon after he started at Frank, he was named by \"Chatelaine\" magazine as one of Canada's sexiest men. Robert Fulford, for example, called him \"Frank\"'s \"slanderer-in-chief\"\n\nBate purchased Bentley's share of Ottawa \"Frank\" during the 1990s and later sold the franchise to Fabrice Taylor in 2003. Taylor moved the magazine's headquarters to Toronto and said he planned to turn it into a serious satire magazine. Circulation declined after the sale and the magazine went out of business in December 2004.\n\nBate regained ownership of the property and started an online version of the Ottawa edition of the magazine called \"eFrank.ca\" on September 27, 2005, with a print version following in late November 2005. Within a month of publication, his new venture had its first lawsuit. For a publisher who thrived on controversy, Bate was pleased, \"It's just like the old days. Now it's official. We're back.\" Bate decided to cease publishing in October 2008 as subscriptions had declined once again. \"Frank\", said Bate, was a victim of the Internet. At the time, Bate said he was contemplating a book on the publication's controversial run.\n\nIn an interview with The Globe and Mail in May 2013, he said the new Frank would have a metered paywall, which would enable readers to read a few stories before having to pay \"about 50 cents a day, or $15 a month.\" In the past two years, hundreds of publications, large and small, have erected paywalls. Bate pointed to Andrew Sullivan’s The Dish, which instituted a metered paywall earlier this year, as a financial model for the new Frank.\n\nBate is featured prominently in the 2001 muckraking documentary film \"The Frank Truth\" which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n"}

{"id": "2320268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320268", "title": "La Asunción", "text": "La Asunción\n\nLa Asunción () is a city in Venezuela. The capital of Nueva Esparta state (made up of three islands), it lies on the Isla Margarita in the Caribbean Sea, off the South American mainland. It is inland from Porlamar and is in a genuine colonial setting. It has an imposing backdrop of Santa Rosa Castle, also known as the Santa Rosa Fort, which was built to protect the city. The most important structures in the city are built around the Plaza Bolivar. The Catedral Nuestra Señora de La Asunción, dated to the 16th century, is one of the earliest churches in the country. According to the 2011 census, it has a population of 28,513 people.\n\nLa Asunción was founded in 1565 by Captain Pedro González Cervantes de Albornoz. It is situated in a fertile valley surrounded by green hills, right in the center of eastern Margarita, where a fresher climate exist. It is the seat of the regional government.\n\nIn 1562, the Spanish villages of Espiritu Santo migrated to this hamlet to escape the marauding pirates and the tyrant Lope de Aguirre Spanish invaders. However, the pirates did not spare them as later in 1566 the French pirates headed by Jean Bontemps completely razed the village which was further compounded by the English privateer John Hopkins. However, as it got re-established as a town, it was given the Coat of Arms and called a city. This was followed by the building of the Santa Rosa fort.\n\nLa Asunción thus was founded in 1565 by Captain Pedro González Cervantes de Albornoz. Construction of the Santa Rosa de la Eminencia castle on a hill overlooking the city began on the orders of the governor, Juan Muñoz de Gadea, after the French buccaneer Marquis de Maintenon attacked the city in early 1676. The work was started on 24 March 1677 and finished , under the command of the field master Don Juan Fermin. La Asunción was involved in the Venezuelan War of Independence, and noted General Juan Bautista Arismendi married his wife Luisa Cáceres de Arismendi on December 4, 1814 in the city at the age of 39. Abandoned in 1935, twenty years later due to a local initiative the castle achieved the status of a War Museum. It was declared as a National Monument in 1965 by president Raúl Leoni.\n\nIt is situated in a fertile valley surrounded by green hills in the Santa Lucia valley, in the center of eastern Isla Margarita. Porlamar is to the south. It was then a secluded location considering its inaccessibility to pirates in the olden days. It is a fertile valley which is nurtured by the Cerro El Copey which rises in the mountains here. A bridge across the Río Asunción was built in 1609 which existed till 1970 and provided entry to the town from the north.\n\nLa Asunción under the Nueva Esparta State (NES) had a population of 10,375 in 1981 and the recent figure as of 30 October 2010 was 28,309. The corresponding figure for the NES was 263,748 and 491,610.\n\nIt is the seat of the regional government and the municipality of Arismendi Municipality, Nueva Esparta.\n\nThe city has two banks, a post office, two museums, and a private hospital with modern facilities. The Palacio Municipal is located behind the cathedral and houses the offices of the state government. The Assemblea Legislativa is accommodated in the building which was earlier a franciscan monastery and which also subsequently served as a hospital and prison. A sundial fixed in 1612 at the initiative of a governor, is known as \"Relox Equinoccia Inferior\". which is still seen at this venue. The Plaza of La Asuncion is in two parts, the southern part is named as Plaza Bolivar and the northern part is named Plaza Luisa Caceres, whose statue is installed there. An old double storied house has been converted into a souvenir shop with a coffee kiosk. The birthplace of the independence hero Juan Bautista Arismendi, husband of Luisa Caceres de Arismendi has been refurbished.\n\nLa Asunción is located 30 kilometers from Santiago Mariño Caribbean International Airport which offers scheduled flights to mainland Venezuela as well as charter flights to international destinations.\nFerry services are available from a terminal 40 kilometers to the southwest in Punta de Piedras. Conferry offers service to Puerto La Cruz, Guanta, and La Guaira, on mainland Venezuela as well as service to Coche Island. \nSome of the prominent landmarks of La Asuncion are the cathedral of Nuestra Senora de la Asuncion, the Santa Rosa castle, the Museo Nueva Cádiz, the Casa de la Cultura and Cerro El Copey National Park.\n\nBuilt between 1570 and 1612, the Catedral Nuestra Señora de La Asunción is the oldest existing church in Venezuela. Its construction was started in 1570 (much before the construction of the cathedral of Coro) and was never completed. A new church was built from 1609 which took 10 years to complete. The church has a rectangular plan with massive walls as protection against pirate attacks. Supported on two lines of huge pillars which support the roof. There is a bell tower outside and which is also unique and the bells are now preserved in the plaza. One of the most important religious buildings on the Island, the Virgin of La Asunción is worshipped here. The cathedral has been declared a historical city monument. It has a plain façade and interior, but its left lateral tower, which dates to 1599, is the oldest in the country. The important festival observed here is in mid August to celebrate Our Lady of Assumption when a procession is held and mass offered in the church.\n\nThe castle of Santa Rosa de la Eminencia was built in 1682 due to its prominent location on a hill; it acted as an observatory to watch for any invading forces approaching from the north, south, or east. A tunnel (a kilometer long dug during the original construction) from the fort connected to the governor's house, the church and the Convent of San Francisco. The fort guarded the eastern approach to the capital and was one of three forts that secured the island's strategic location to fend off the English, French, Dutch and other colonizers. It was where Luisa Caceres de Arismendi, wife of the leading freedom fighter Juan Bautista Arismendi against Spanish imperialism, after capture by the Spanish on 27 September was imprisoned here one day before she became 17 years of age in 1816. She became a local heroine; in the prison cell of the fort, her first son was born and died prematurely due to lack of medical attention. She was imprisoned as her husband had escaped to the forests of Cerro El Copey and by capturing her they hoped that they could make the freedom fighter to surrender but the plan failed. After the death of the baby she was moved to Spain from where she escaped. She eventually joined her husband with whom she begot 11 children and the died at the age of 65. After her death she had the honour of being buried in the El Pantheon Nacional in Caracas one of the two women buried here. The cell where she was incarcerated in the castle has been preserved in its original form in which she lived. An inscription at the entrance to the cell reads \"Luisa Caceres de Arismendi\" for her virtue valour and martyrdom for her husband and country as prisoner in this jail when she was 16 years of age.\" The fort with strong sense of military purpose has exhibits of weapons of warfare, paintings of Simon Bolivar, knights in armor, and also iron balls which were tied to the legs of prisoners. Behind the kitchen there is abottle dungeon whose entrance is through a hole in the roof. The fort provides an excellent view of the sea and Cerro Matasiete. It had a moat and a draw bridge which no longer exist. The map on display in the museum is reported to be the best in the world.\n\nThe Casa Capitular, the seat of the colonial government, and a city hall has been re-purposed as the Museo Nueva Cádiz (Museum New Cádiz) which features displays of pre-colonial artifacts and local handicrafts. Initially, as the seat of the government it had housed the offices in the first floor and a prison on the ground floor. On May 4, 1810, the museum was the venue for Margarita's Declaration of Independence following the declaration made in Caracas on April 19, 1810. As the prison space was inadequate to accommodate the large number of prisoners, it was converted into a museum with a gallery and a biliary.\n\nAn interesting display in the museum is a sculpture of the tyrant ruler Lope de Aguirre who had terrorized the islanders during 1561; this event is featured in the film titled \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\" produced by Werner Herzog with Klaus Kinski in the lead role.\n\nCasa de Juan Bautista Arismendi honors Venezuela's war hero, Juan Bautista Arismendi.\n\nThe Casa de la Cultura is located opposite to the church and has a theater. A pre-Columbian pottery collection is on display here and replicas of the same could be bought in the nearby town of Santa Ana.\n\nIsla Margarita and particularly \"Cerro El Copey National Park\" are especially important with respect to the numbers of endemic species they harbor. The island was connected to mainland until the Pleistocene. As a result, there is a predominance of typical continental bird families like Tinamidae, Dendrocolaptidae, Formicaridae and Furnaridae, which are totally absent from the Antilles. Circa 31 mammal species are found on the island, four of which (the red-tailed squirrel \"Sciurus granatensis nesaeus\", the eastern cottontail rabbit \"Sylvilagus floridanus margaritae\", the white-tailed dear \"Odocoileus virginianus margaritae\", and the capuchin monkey \"Cebus apella margaritae\") are endemic subspecies, with the main populations located inside the national park. The Margarita capuchin monkey is considered to be the country's most threatened primate species and is critically endangered.\n\n"}

{"id": "2320275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320275", "title": "Urban Dead", "text": "Urban Dead\n\nUrban Dead is a free-to-play HTML/text-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game created by British developer Kevan Davis. Set in a quarantined region of the fictional city of Malton, it deals with the aftermath of a zombie outbreak. Players enter the game either as a survivor or a zombie, each with different abilities and limitations. Survivors become zombies when they are killed, while zombies can be \"revivified\" with appropriate technology, returning to life as a survivor – any character played for long will thus spend some time alive and some as a zombie. There are no non-player characters in the game: all survivors and zombies are controlled by players.\n\n\"Urban Dead\" went live in July 2005.\n\nGameplay involves zombies breaking into safe houses and attacking the inhabitants, and survivors trying to defend the buildings by barricading them and killing any zombies present. Safe houses tend to be located in or near buildings where useful items can be found, such as shopping malls, police stations, hospitals, and the laboratories of the zombie-related NecroTech corporation. Cooperation between players is not strictly enforced. Internal fighting between survivors and zombies is a frequent occurrence. \"Urban Dead\" has no economy. Survivor characters can loot supplies from abandoned buildings indefinitely, but cannot trade, sell, or give them to other players.\n\nNew players begin the game as one of the three survivor classes; Military, Scientist or Civilian; or as a Zombie. Each side in the struggle has its own advantages and disadvantages. Survivors move twice as fast as low-level zombies and are able to employ various weapons and tools. Survivor characters can communicate with each other in-game via speech, radio broadcasting, graffiti and text messaging. They can also barricade building entrances, keeping zombies at bay. Zombies, often referred to as \"zeds\", are limited to using claws, teeth, and blunt melee weapons. However, they can self-revive with full hit points when killed, whereas a survivor needs another player to revive them after death if they do not wish to play as a zombie. Higher level zombies can communicate with each other via a crude form of zombie speech, as well as through various groaning noises and hand gestures. It is possible to switch sides in the conflict: a survivor character that is killed will rise up as a zombie, and zombie characters may be brought back to life by a survivor who has the relevant skills and items.\n\nPlayers receive action points as time passes, which are used up any time they move, fight, or undertake any other sort of activity. One action point is gained every half-hour of realtime, up to a maximum of fifty points. When a character's action points drop to zero or lower, that character is unable to perform any action until they gain further points, survivors fall asleep and zombies' brains cease to function. Should a survivor run out of action points whilst in an unsecured area, they are at great risk of attack by zombies during sleep. Players must make sure that their survivor characters are in a safe place before logging out, encouraging quick raids from fortified safe houses. The use of Action Points as a limit on character actions is similar to the systems of several other free MMORPGs such as \"Kingdom of Loathing\".\n\nAs players damage their opponents or perform certain other actions, their experience points increase. While survivors can also gain experience from performing a variety of actions, such as healing other characters or repairing damage to buildings, zombies can only gain experience points by attacking other characters or objects in the game world. When players gain enough experience points, they can buy new skills. A character can only buy survivor skills while alive, and only zombie skills while dead; although skills of one type are not lost if the character dies or is revived, most survivor skills cannot be used by zombies, and vice versa. Survivor characters can effectively learn the skills of all survivor classes, not just the class they begin with, though skills outside of their chosen class can be more expensive. For a long time, the highest level that a player could reach if all skills were purchased was 42, however due to the skill \"Brain Rot\" making it more difficult to get revives, many players opt to leave it unpurchased and as a result there are a greater number of players at level 41 as opposed to level 42. On October 14, 2008, a new zombie skill \"Flesh Rot\" was added, thus making it possible to reach level 43. With the new additions of the skills \"Bellow\" and \"Scout safehouse\" in August 2010, the highest level possible to be obtain in the game is now 45.\n\nSurvivors who die and return as zombies do not have to switch sides - they can gather at designated \"revive points\" scattered throughout the city where they wait for survivors with the relevant skills and equipment to revive them. Revive points are considered neutral ground and survivors are generally discouraged from killing zombies found there. Some players and groups on both sides have also set their own distinct goals, many of which are set for purely role-playing purposes. \"Urban Dead\" is not limited to survivor versus zombie combat, groups of survivors can attack other survivors, known as player killing. Within the game, this is viewed as an act of murder; however, it is not against the game rules and is seen by some more advanced players as playing the game on \"Hard\" due to only receiving half the experience points that one would receive for attacking zombies. Individuals that engage in this behavior are often tracked by bounty hunters. Some zombie groups use living characters as spies and saboteurs, usually during or in preparation for a major attack on a safe house (mainly malls). These collaborators are often referred to as \"zombie spies\" or \"death cultists\".\n\nAs well as the city of Malton, two other cities - Monroeville and Borehamwood - have been set up on the same server. Account creation in these cities has been disabled, and the population of active characters is very low. Both feature permanent death, since there were no revivification syringes in the game. When a survivor character was killed, that character remained dead and there was no way of reviving them. Monroeville was named after the shooting location of \"Dawn of the Dead\", and Borehamwood was a tie-in with the TV series \"Dead Set\".\n\n\"Urban Dead\" was created by Kevan Davis, a freelance video game designer and web developer, in 2005. Davis was inspired by a similar game called \"Vampires!\", which was created by a friend, and play-by-mail games. These were combined with elements of \"NetHack\", MUSHes, interactive fiction and a zombie infection simulation he had developed in 2003. This created a game which required approximately 10 minutes of planning and play a day; involving exploration, interaction and item discovery.\n\n\n"}

It carries the A4095 road across the river on the reach above Radcot Lock. Adjoining the bridge is the Swan Inn and slight earthworks of Matilda's Castle.\n\nThere are in fact three stone bridges at this point on the Thames, from south to north: Radcot Bridge, the Canal Bridge and Pidnell Bridge. The first is nearest to Pidnell (a hamlet in Faringdon parish) and the last is nearest to Radcot. Whilst originally built on the Thames, Radcot Bridge is now on a backwater since the construction, in 1787, of a new cut for the Thames and Severn Canal. The Canal Bridge was built at the same time.\n\nRadcot Bridge is often claimed as the \"oldest bridge on the Thames\", having been built, with pointed arches of Taynton stone, around 1200. The Cistercian monks of St Mary at Cîteaux in Normandy were granted land for the purpose by King John. Much of the structure was broken down during the battle which took place here in 19 December 1387 between troops loyal to Richard II, led by court favourite Robert de Vere, and an army captained by Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby, (the future Henry IV). Radcot Bridge was reconstructed in 1393. \nThe bridge was again severely damaged during the Wars of the Roses, and was largely rebuilt as it appears today, with a flattened centre arch.\n\nRadcot Bridge became a toll bridge and its wharf was commercially important as the highest shipping point on the Thames, with the junction of the Severn-Thames canal not far away at Lechlade (Gloucestershire).\n\nThe Thames Path crosses the bridges.\n\n\"Time Team\", in a programme first broadcast on 15 February 2009, excavated Matilda's Castle in the summer of 2008. They found that visible earthworks near the Radcot bridge dated from the 17th-century English Civil War, when Parliamentary forces built them to support cannon used to bombard Royalist forces garrisoned in Radcot House. Underneath some of these earthworks were remains of a square Norman keep dating from the time of the 12th-century Anarchy. Evidence suggested the tower was pulled down a century after it was built. Its remains were further damaged by later constructions on the site. Some Roman remains, possibly from a villa, were also found.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2320283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320283", "title": "Baldassare Franceschini", "text": "Baldassare Franceschini\n\nBaldassare Franceschini (16116 January 1689) was an Italian late Baroque painter active mainly around Florence. He was named, from Volterra the place of his birth, Il Volterrano, or (to distinguish him from Ricciarelli) Il Volterrano Giuniore, and was the son of a sculptor in alabaster.\n\nAt an early age, he worked as an assistant to his father, a sculptor, and then studied with the Volterran artist Cosimo Daddi. This employment did not make full use of his talents, so the Marquese Inghirami placed him, at the age of sixteen, under the Florentine painter Matteo Rosselli. Both Francesco Furini and Lorenzo Lippi also trained with Rosselli. Within a year, he had advanced sufficiently to execute frescoes in Volterra with skilled foreshortening, followed by work for the Medici family in the Villa Petraia.\n\nIn 1652, the Marchese Filippo Niccolini, planning to employ Franceschini on the frescoes for the cupola and back-wall of his chapel in Santa Croce, Florence, dispatched him to various parts of Italy to improve his style. The painter, in a tour that lasted some months, took a serious interest in the schools of Parma and Bologna, and, to some extent, in the Romano-Tuscan style of Pietro da Cortona, whose acquaintance he made in Rome. He then undertook the paintings commissioned by Niccolini. These are his best works and the most well-known.\n\nFranceschini was a better fresco painter than an artist in oils. His works in the latter medium were frequently left unfinished, although numerous examples remain; the cabinet pictures are marked by much invention. He painted a scene of \"Elias sleeping\" for a wooden polyptych in the church of San Giusto in Volterra. He painted frescoes celebrating the Medici ancestry for the inner court of the Villa Petraia. The influence of his decorative style on Volterrano's work at the Villa Petraia is clear. They include a painting of the hunchbacked court jester. Among his best oil paintings on a large scale is the \"St. John the Evangelist\" in the church of Santa Chiara, Volterra. One of his latest works is the fresco in the cupola of the Annunziata, Florence, which occupied him for two years towards 1683.\n\nFranceschini died of apoplexy at Volterra on 6 January 1689.\n\nHis style is often distinguished by theatrical effects. Among his pupils were Massimiliano Soldani-Benzi, Antonio Franchi, Benedetto Orsi, Michelangelo Palloni, Domenico Tempesta, and Cosimo Ulivelli.\n\nBaldassare should not be confused with another eminent artist named Franceschini and of rather later date: the Cavaliere Marcantonio Franceschini (1648–1729), who was a Bolognese.\n"}

He is both a high-school dropout and one of the youngest recipients of a MacArthur Foundation \"genius\" grant. Born in the Philippines, he moved to the United States at 16. His works, which include the novels \"Fixer Chao\" and \"The Disinherited,\" address such themes as outsiderness, cultural clash, and class conflict.\n\n\"I've written enough now to figure out I have a recurring tendency, which is that a lot of my characters are outsiders,\" Ong told a reporter after the debut of his second book, \"It comes from being an outsider twice over—my queerness and my ethnicity. I think it's a gift, though. In life it may not be a gift, but in art it is.\" \n\nHan Ong was born on February 5, 1968, to ethnic Chinese parents in Manila, the Philippines. His family immigrated to the United States in 1984, and they settled in Koreatown in Los Angeles. He attended Grant High School, a predominantly white school. Ong did not share a close relationship with his four siblings, and he struggled with a sense of alienation in his new homeland as well as with his experience with adolescence. He recalled, \"Puberty plus a new country—both are tough enough on their own.\" Thus, he found solace in books and television.\n\nA high school drama course sparked his interest in theater. He wrote his first play at age sixteen and was admitted to a young playwrights' lab at the Los Angeles Theater Center. He dropped out of high school at age eighteen because he did not feel that it was beneficial; however, he earned a GED later. Ong worked several odd jobs to support himself as he wrote, such as working in a trophy-manufacturing warehouse, until he was awarded a commission from the Mark Taper Forum and a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nIn 1993 Ong was a winner of the Kesselring Prize for best new American plays for \"Swoony Planet\".\n\nIn 1994, Ong moved to New York where he received critical acclaim for his plays. He was praised by Robert Brustein, the artistic director of the American Repertory Theater and one of the most esteemed figures of the American stage. In 1997, at age twenty-nine, Ong was one of twenty-three winners of the prestigious MacArthur Fellowships; his grant was $200,000. Ong said in an interview with the Washington Post's Lonnae O'Neal Parker, \"I hope this MacArthur Fellowship demonstrates the importance of self-determination and the hunger for improvement for people of [my generation]. I didn't take being a [high-school] dropout as a measure of my intelligence or as a harbinger of my future.\"\n\nOng's works have been performed at venues such as the Highways Performance Space and Gallery and the Berkeley Repertory Theater in California; Joseph Papp Public Theater in New York; Portland Stage Company in Maine; Boston's American Repertory Theater; and at the Almeida Theater in London. Ong collaborated with fellow Filipino American writer Jessica Hagedorn in 1993 to write a performance piece entitled \"Airport Music\" for the Los Angeles Festival.\n\nOng is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fiction and the TCG/NEA Playwriting Award. \"Fixer Chao\" was named a Los Angeles Times \"Best Book of the Year\" and was nominated for a Stephen Crane First Fiction Award. \"The Disinherited\" was nominated for a LAMBDA Book Award.\n\nAlthough the MacArthur Foundation's Genius Grant finished in 2002, Ong continues to write despite his lamentation that he is \"a little poorer now.\" He has recently focused his efforts solely on novels and hopes to revisit the Philippines after more than twenty years of separation from his homeland.\n\nOng is a recipient of the 2010/2011 Berlin Prize Fellowship from the American Academy in Berlin.\n\n\nOng's works are often set in urban, multicultural settings. His plays can be divided into two groups: those exploring the issues related to immigration (a search for roots, clashes of culture, identity crisis, American Dream) and those that examine the lives of non-stereotypical Asian Americans. His work portrays the darker side of Asian American life. The characters are typically depressed and hopeless. They are alienated from society and lack mutual communication, respect, and warmth in their family lives. This sense of alienation and outsiderness draws upon the memories of his adolescence. Ong characterizes his work as having \"a point of view of somebody with their noses pressed against the glass looking in. It's like a jewel: you turn a different facet to the light.\" Ong writes from an American perspective, but his Filipino descent is \"the more concrete thing I can actually fall back on in terms of nostalgia, of identification.\"\n\nDavid Henry Hwang considers Ong as a \"younger, or 'Third Wave' Asian/Pacific playwright\" who refuses to focus mainly on racial issues. The American Repertory Theater's Robert Brustein has compared Ong to Shakespeare because he is \"the most exciting new talent to evolve in years\" without much formal education. Writing in the New Yorker on the occasion of the world premiere production of \"The L.A. Plays\" at the American Repertory Theater, critic John Lahr said of Ong: \"blessed with a singular theatrical voice, he's at the beginning of what is already an exciting career.\" Of that play's subsequent London production at the Almeida Theater, critic Michael Billington of the Guardian wrote that Ong \"has a remarkable gift for distilled dialogue and for pinning down the fragmentation, solitude and despair of the city of dreams.\" San Jose Mercury News theater critic Judith Green praises Ong's \"Bachelor Rat\" for his \"deft way with words: an ability to layer poetry on reality and an unusual appreciation of irony.\" However, Green criticizes the depth of \"Airport Music\" because it is \"mostly about anger, which is a good servant but a bad master.\" The Boston Globe's Kevin Kelly echoes these sentiments and has questioned Ong's abilities and effectiveness. He refers to Ong as a \"quick-scene dramatist\" who has \"brute observation, poetic sensibility, sharp characterization and cinematic skill.\" Kelly attacks Ong's performance as an actor (he assayed the lead in the American Repertory Theater production of \"The L.A. Plays\") and characterizes him as \"a fussy, low-level actor who uses too many gestures and too often settles for moony passivity.\" It should also be pointed out that Ong has been a performance artist whose solo shows \"Symposium in Manila\" and \"Cornerstore Geography\" have drawn praise in various cities (L.A., San Francisco, New York) where they have been performed.\n\n\n"}

They were: \"\" (1994), \"\" (1995), \"\" (1996), \"\" (1996), and \"\" (1997).\n\nIn 1997, he wrote and directed the movie \"Steel\", based on the DC comic book character Steel. It featured basketball player Shaquille O'Neal as John Henry Irons, the character's alter-ego. The film was a financial and critical failure.\n\nHe directed the 1999 Disney Channel Original Movie \"\", starring Kirsten Storms as the eponymous heroine. The film was based on the book \"\" written by Marilyn Sadler and Roger Bollen.\n\nIn 1999 he also directed \"Don't Look Under the Bed\", a Disney Channel Original Movie.\n\nIn 2006, Johnson announced his completion of a four-hour script for a new \"V\" mini series called \"V: The Second Generation\". The storyline takes place 20 years after the original 1983 mini-series, ignoring the second mini-series (\"V: The Final Battle\") and subsequent weekly television series. However, NBC told Johnson that they were more interested in a remake of the original \"V\" mini-series instead, which, if successful, might lead to his proposed sequel.\n\nSince then, Johnson adapted his screenplay for \"V: The Second Generation\" into a novel. It was published by Tor Books and released on February 5, 2008. However, since his discussions with NBC, Warner Bros (who hold the television rights to the \"V\" franchise) have opted to produce a remake of \"V\" (written by Scott Peters) for the ABC Network, thus ending any prospect of Johnson's sequel being produced for television.\n\nIn April 2008, Johnson stated his intention to remake the original \"V\" mini-series and his new sequel \"V: The Second Generation\" into feature films. Johnson claimed to have been in discussions with producers interested in the project. Since this statement, Johnson's potential film production has not been developed further, although talks with potential backers are still ongoing. The Warner Bros. television remake for ABC premiered on November 3, 2009. It was canceled in 2011, after two seasons, due to low ratings.\n\nIn 2017, Johnson published the 430 pages fiction novel \"The Man of Legends\".\n\nIn February 2018, Kenneth Johnson announced on his official website that V:The Movie (a trilogy) would be made with him as Director and Producer along with Desilu Studios Johnson has since updated his website to say that Desilu's option had expired, and referred to new allegations.\n\nJohnson married Bonnie Hollaway on February 2, 1963, and they divorced in 1975. They have three children. On June 19, 1977 (the day after completing filming of the pilot movie of \"The Incredible Hulk\" series), he married Susan Appling, and they have one child.\n\n"}

During the American War of Independence Despard led a force to victory at the Battle of the Black River, securing the British presence on the Mosquito Coast. Following the war Despard was appointed Superintendent of what became British Honduras. He was recalled to London in 1790 after questions were raised about his conduct. Despard soon found himself in jail for debt. He later took up revolutionary politics, becoming involved with the United Britons movement, and was executed for high treason for his part in the failed Despard Plot.\n\nEdward Despard was born in 1751 into a Protestant family of Huguenot and Anglo-Irish descent in Coolrain, Camross, Queens County, Ireland. He was one of five brothers all of whom (except the eldest, who inherited the family estate), served in the British military. Despard's elder brother John Despard (1745–1829) was an army officer who rose to the rank of full General.\n\nIn 1766 he entered the British Army as an Ensign in the 50th Foot. He was promoted to Lieutenant in 1772, and stationed at Jamaica, where he soon proved himself to have considerable engineering talent.\n\nWhen the American War of Independence broke out the regiment, significantly under strength, remained in the West Indies rather than joining the army of William Howe attempting to suppress the rebellion. He served in the West Indies with credit, being promoted to Captain after taking part in the unsuccessful 1780 San Juan expedition. Despard struck up a friendship with the naval officer Horatio Nelson, who played a leading role in the San Juan campaign.\n\nIn 1782 he commanded a successful expedition to recover the British settlement of Black River on the Mosquito Coast of present-day Honduras, which the Spanish had taken. In 1783 the war was brought to an end by the Peace of Paris.\n\nDespard was subsequently made Superintendent of the Bay of Honduras, which later became British Honduras and then Belize. He administered this British enclave until 1790 when he had married a young black woman, Catherine Despard, and staked his reputation on giving the same rights to freed slaves as to white settlers.\n\nThis, however, did not go down well with some of the settlers. These settlers sent letters of protest to London, and as a result Despard was summoned back to London to explain himself. He was suspended by Home Secretary Lord Grenville. From 1790 to 1792 these charges were investigated, and he was suspended on half pay with his expenses from the Bay of Honduras withheld. Pursued by a further lawsuit from his enemies in the Bay, he was arrested and confined in King's Bench Prison from 1792 to 1794.\n\nOn his release he joined the London Corresponding Society. In 1798 Despard was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the Irish Rebellion. Habeas Corpus had been suspended in 1794, and Despard was held without trial for nearly three years in a succession of prisons, notably Coldbath Fields Prison in Clerkenwell, until he was released without charge in 1801.\n\nIn late 1802 he was named by government informers and disaffected soldiers as a member of a conspiracy engaged in a plot to seize the Tower of London and Bank of England and assassinate King George III to encourage further uprisings. On 16 November 1802, Colonel Edward Marcus Despard and his co-conspirators were arrested at the Oakley Arms public house at 72 Oakley Street Lambeth on suspicion of plotting the uprising. The evidence was thin but in all, some forty people were arrested and they all appeared before magistrates at Union Hall police office the following day. Their conspiracy had been betrayed by one of the group, Thomas Windsor, who was the chief witness at their trial. They were prosecuted by Attorney General Spencer Perceval, before Lord Ellenborough, the Lord Chief Justice. Despite a dramatic appearance by Lord Nelson as character witness on his behalf, Despard and his co-conspirators were tried before a Special Commission on Monday, 7 February 1803, for conspiring to capture and kill the King and overthrow the government and for planning to stop the mail coaches entering and leaving London and the take over of the Tower of London. Despard was found guilty by the jury of 3 counts of high treason along with John Wood, 36, John Francis, 23, both privates in the army, Thomas Broughton, 26, a carpenter, James Sedgwick Wratton, 35, a shoemaker, Arthur Graham, 53, a slater, John Macnamara, Thomas Newman, Daniel Tindall, and William Lander. All but Newman, Tindall and Lander who were respited and later transported as convicts to Australia were to be hanged, drawn and quartered.\n\nPrior to execution the sentence was commuted to simple hanging and beheading, amid fears that the draconian punishment might spark public dissent. Despard was executed on the roof of the gatehouse at Horsemonger Lane Gaol, in front of a crowd of at least 20,000 spectators, on 21 February 1803. This was the largest public gathering until the funeral of Lord Nelson following the Battle of Trafalgar.\n\nHe is portrayed by Vincent Regan in the fifth series of \"Poldark\".\n\n"}

Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, the ride opened as the park's eleventh roller coaster on April 4, 1998, setting world records among stand-up coasters for height, speed, drop length, track length and number of inversions. The previous record holder was Chang at Kentucky Kingdom which opened a year earlier. Located in the Movie Town area of the park, The Riddler's Revenge was also the park's single biggest investment at a cost of $14 million. It stands tall and features a top speed of . The coaster also features six inversions and a ride duration of approximately three minutes.\n\nThe Riddler's Revenge opened as Six Flags Magic Mountain's eleventh roller coaster on April 4, 1998, setting world records for this type of coaster in height, drop, speed, length and number of inversions. The ride also broke the record for the world's tallest vertical loop. The previous holder of all these records was Chang at Kentucky Kingdom, which was installed exactly one year prior. The opening of the ride was part of a redevelopment of the Monterey Landing themed area into the Movie Town themed area. As part of the expansion the park added new restaurants, retail outlets, and rethemed some existing rides.\n\nIn March 2000, The Riddler's Revenge conceded the title of the world's largest vertical loop to at Six Flags Fiesta Texas. The floorless roller coaster featured a vertical loop, taller than that of The Riddler's Revenge. The park closed several rides including The Riddler's Revenge in early 2017 to begin the construction of Metropolis, a new themed area that resulted in new paint schemes along with modified entrance and exit queues for some attractions. The new area opened on July 12, 2017, which marked the reopening of The Riddler's Revenge.\n\nThe Riddler's Revenge stands tall. With a top speed of , the ride features six inversions including a vertical loop, two dive loops, an inclined loop, and two corkscrews. The vertical loop featured on The Riddler's Revenge wraps around the lift hill; Kumba at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and Banshee at Kings Island are the only other rides in the world to feature a loop of this kind. Riders of The Riddler's Revenge experience up to 4.2 times the force of gravity on the three-minute ride. The Riddler's Revenge cost $14 million to build, making it the single biggest investment on an attraction at the park.\n\nThe Riddler's Revenge operates with three steel-and-fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars with four seats in a single row, for a total of 32 riders. Riders are secured by an over-the-shoulder harness. Although The Riddler's Revenge is a stand-up roller coaster, there is a small bicycle seat on which riders straddle. This configuration of trains caters for a capacity of 1,610 riders per hour.\n\nThe Riddler's Revenge is one of four Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters at Six Flags Magic Mountain, joining \"\", Scream, and Tatsu. The coaster is the park's second stand-up coaster; the first was a smaller coaster manufactured by Giovanola and contracted by Intamin, Shockwave, which operated from 1986 to 1988. Shockwave was relocated to Six Flags Great Adventure, preceding the installation of Green Lantern (a retheming and relocation of Chang).\n\nAs its name suggests, The Riddler's Revenge is themed after the DC Comics character Riddler. The track was originally painted green with black supports until 2017, when the supports were repainted yellow. As the Riddler was an archenemy of Batman, The Riddler's Revenge is located appropriately adjacent to \"Batman: The Ride\", in the back of the park. The Riddler's signature question mark is featured on the coaster's logo. The techno music that played on the loading platform is Ecuador (Bruce Wayne Mix) by Sash! (Bruce Wayne being the secret identity of Riddler's nemesis, Batman).\n\nThe ride begins with a right turn out of the station. Once the train ascends the chain lift hill it goes through a small pre-drop, before dropping on a banked left turn. It then enters the vertical loop which wraps around the lift hill. Two dive loops follow, the second of which also wraps around the lift hill. An inclined loop is followed by two right turns that lead up and into the mid-course brake run. After dropping out of the brake run, the train immediately enters a corkscrew to the left. A series of direction and elevation changes lead into a second corkscrew, the inverted part of which is just above a portion of the queue line. The track then turns to the right and enters the final brake run before returning to the station.\n\nThe Riddler's Revenge has made four appearances on \"Amusement Today\"'s annual Golden Ticket Awards top 50 steel roller coasters. It debuted on the poll in 2003 at position 41, before peaking at 38 in 2006.\n\n"}

It is situated about 10 km from Angamaly and 6 km from Kalady. Chandrappura and Vadakkumbhagom are the main business centers.\n\nIf you look Manjapra from sky, it looks like an island surrounded by paddy fields on all sides. The unique geographical feature of Manjapra is that all four entry points to this panchayat are from a \"padam\" (cultivated paddy field) and stream of water called as \"Thodu\". The first entry point is Kuzhiampadam from Kalady town, the second is Karingallikkadu padam from Angamaly town, the third is Naduthodu from Neeleswaram panchayat and the last is Kothayipadam from Azyampuzha panchayat. Another famous agriculture hub is Mularippadam, near Chandrapura.\n\nManjapra, known as green village, is very close to the famous Christian pilgrimage centre, Malayattoor, which is one of the few places visited by Saint Thomas, an apostle of Jesus Christ. Also, it is closer to the renowned Sree Sankara Temple, Kalady. Manjapra is renowned for its religious harmony and the people's attitude in celebrating festivals together.\n\nChandrapura is the main business hub with all the government offices including panchayat, village, electricity office and krishibhavan is located. Manjapra has three major schools (St Marys U.P.S, Government High School and St. Patrick academy) that provide quality education. Traditionally, the people of Manjapra are known for their skill and knowledge in brewing liquor and agriculture products. Quality agriculture products are exported to different parts of the world from this village carrying the brand name of Manjapra. Crops include snake beans, bananas, bitter melon, nutmeg, pepper, tapioca, etc. A majority of the youth from this village works in jobs like IT professionals, nurses, doctors, teachers, technicians, etc. Many workers in Australia, the UK, and the Middle East originate in this village.\n\n\nThese are the religious places in Manjapra, Holy Cross Forane Church, Karppillikkavu Sree Mahadeva Temple, St. George Church and Puthoorppilly Sree Krishnaswamy Temple.\n\nKarppillikkavu temple is one of the rare temples in Kerala in which Mahadeva is giving \"Darshan\" to the west. \nPuthoorppilly temple is also known as \"Kallamabalam\" because of its unique architecture where the sanctum sanctorum is made of \"Kallu\"-Malayalam for stone-. According to legend, this was made by the \"Bhuthaganas\" of Lord Shiva overnight. The temple is a protected site by the Archaeological Survey of India and managed by the Travancore Devaswom Board.\n\nThe main church, Holy Cross Church Manjapra, is another religious site in Ernakulam district in Kerala. The church celebrates the feast \"perunnal\" of St. Sebastian and St. Mary in the months of January and November annually. It is believed the church was built about 500 years ago [AD 1401] and the monument of this construction is still protected. Sebipuram church situated in the north side of Manjapra, celebrates the feast of St. Sebastian and St. Alphonsa during the months of January and August every year.\n"}

It is about a man who pretends to be homosexual to keep his job, with absurd and unexpected consequences.\n\nFrançois Pignon, an unassuming divorced man with a teenage son who ignores him, lives a quiet and unremarkable life. When he learns he will be fired from his job as an accountant in a rubber factory, he contemplates suicide, but his new neighbor Jean-Pierre Belone, a former industrial psychologist, dissuades him from jumping from his balcony and suggests a way to keep his position. Belone proposes that Pignon start a rumor he is homosexual by inserting his image in sexually provocative snapshots of a gay couple in a bar and anonymously mailing them to his boss, Mr. Kopel. The factory's primary product is condoms, so the gay community's support is essential, and Kopel will have to keep Pignon on the payroll to avoid charges of anti-homosexual bigotry.\n\nPignon does not change his usual mild and self-effacing behavior and mannerisms in any way as part of his masquerade. But his supervisors and co-workers begin to regard him in a new light, seeing him as exotic rather than dull, and his life becomes unexpectedly and dramatically better. Félix Santini, a homophobic co-worker who used to harass him, is warned he could be fired for discrimination if he continues to belittle Pignon, so he begins to make friendly overtures.\n\nThe company enters a float in a local gay pride parade, and Pignon is coerced into riding on it; his estranged son sees him in the televised broadcast of the parade and tells his mother. The son is thrilled to learn his father, whom he has always considered bland and boring, has a wilder side, and expresses an interest in spending more time with him. His suspicious ex-wife invites Pignon to dinner and demands an explanation. He has by this point gained enough self-confidence to tell her exactly what he thinks of her.\n\nMeanwhile, Santini's charade of friendship has developed into an obsessive attraction; his wife suspects him of having an affair when she finds a receipt for an expensive pink cashmere sweater, and leaves him when he buys Pignon chocolates. After this, Santini invites Pignon to move in with him. When Pignon turns him down, Santini snaps, a fight ensues, and Santini is institutionalized to recover from his emotional breakdown.\n\nEventually, Pignon's ruse is discovered when Kopel catches him making love in the office to his co-worker, Mlle Bertrand. However, he has become so assertive that he keeps his job, relates to his son, patches up his relationship with Santini, cheers up Belone, and lives happily ever after.\n\n\nExteriors were filmed in Chaville, Clamart, Suresnes, and central Paris. Interiors were shot in Studios Éclair in Epinay-sur-Seine.\n\nThe film was first released in France, Belgium, and Switzerland. Later the film was shown at the L'Alliance Française French Film Festival in Australia, the Miami Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the Newport International Film Festival, and the Seattle International Film Festival, and went into limited release in the US. It grossed $6,678,894 in the US and $43,425,851 in foreign markets for a worldwide box office of $50,104,745.\n\nStephen Holden of the \"New York Times\" called it \"giddy social comedy\" and \"a classic French farce\" and added, \"What's so liberating about \"The Closet\" is its refusal to walk on politically correct eggshells. The target of its blunt lusty humor is as much exaggerated political correctness and the panic it can engender as it is bigotry.\" \n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" said, \"The movie passes the time pleasantly and has a few good laughs ... But the screenplay relies too much on the first level of its premise and doesn't push into unexpected places. Once we get the setup, we can more or less anticipate the sitcom payoff, and there aren't the kinds of surprises, reversals and explosions of slapstick that made \"La Cage Aux Folles\" so funny. In the rating system of the Michelin Guide, it's worth a look, but not a detour or a journey.\" \n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" called the film \"a bonbon spiked with mirth and malice\" and noted, \"Auteuil and Depardieu spar hilariously, and writer-director Francis Veber, following \"The Dinner Game\", offers another delicious treat.\" \n\nLisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" rated the film A-, calling it a \"cagey, high gloss comedy\" and a \"perfectly built French tickler.\" \n\nDaniel Auteuil was named Best Actor at the Shanghai International Film Festival.\n\n"}

His nickname is \"The Cannibal\" for his ability to \"eat up\" the opposition. He was noted for his tackling and versatility at the back.\n\nHe played top-flight football in the Netherlands, Germany, England, Spain, Portugal and Denmark. A full international from 2004 to 2012, he earned 35 caps and was included in the Dutch squads for two World Cups and two European Championships.\n\nBoulahrouz was born in Maassluis, Netherlands to a family of Moroccan descent. He has eight siblings. As a youngster he went to the youth academies of Ajax and Haarlem. When he was sixteen his father died and he had to take responsibility for his family.\n\nIn December 2006, he married Sabia Thele. While Boulahrouz was in Switzerland preparing for the Euro 2008 quarter finals against Russia, his then wife Sabia gave birth to a prematurely born daughter Anissa who died in a Lausanne hospital. He opted to play against Russia a few days later, during which the Dutch team wore black armbands in his daughter's memory. The couple has a second daughter, Amaya (born March 2010) and a son, Daamin (born 30 January 2011). In January 2013 the couple announced their separation.\n\nIn his youth Boulahrouz played consecutively for Excelsior Maassluis, DSOV, Ajax, Haarlem and AZ.\n\nAfter a difficult period playing for different clubs, he finally found some stability at Waalwijk, where coach Martin Jol gave him the confidence he had been looking for. He began his professional career in the Dutch Eredivisie for RKC on 9 March 2002, against Heerenveen.\n\nAfter playing two seasons for RKC he moved to Hamburg to play in the German Bundesliga at the start of the 2004–05 season. While at Hamburg, he earned his nickname \"Khalid der Kannibale\" (\"Khalid the Cannibal\") for his ability to eat up the opposition. This is illustrated by the number of cards he received – 16 yellows and three reds in two seasons at the club. He was also part of a defence that conceded the fewest goals in the 2005–06 Bundesliga season: 30 goals in 34 games.\n\nOn 18 August 2006, Chelsea agreed a fee with Hamburg to sign Boulahrouz. The fee was thought to be around £8.5 million (€12 million). After Chelsea's opening game of the 2006–07 season, manager José Mourinho confirmed that the club had signed Boulahrouz and the club but was waiting for his international clearance to be finalised, before speaking of the potential roles Boulahrouz will have in the side. Mourinho stated \"\"In a short squad and in a country where you can have only 16 players for a match, it’s important to have cover for many positions. So, for example, now I can have [Khalid] Boulahrouz, Ricardo [Carvalho] and John [Terry] — three options for the centre; I can have Paulo [Ferreira] and Boulahrouz – two options for the right side; I can have Boulahrouz and Wayne Bridge — two options for the left side.\"\"\n\nOn 21 August 2006, Chelsea completed the signing of Boulahrouz. Six days later, he was handed his Premiership début against Blackburn Rovers. He wore the number 9 shirt, previously occupied by Hernán Crespo – this is an unconventional number for a defender, being traditionally associated with strikers, but was given to him just because it happened to be one of the numbers not currently allocated to a player by Chelsea at the time of signing.\n\nBoulahrouz made a promising start to his Chelsea career, figuring prominently in high-profile games against Liverpool and Barcelona. However, Boulahrouz gradually dropped out of favour. Boulahrouz was out for a lengthy period of time after a knee injury, followed by a shoulder injury while playing in an FA Cup tie against Norwich City.\n\nBoulahrouz eventually dropped out of contention as the season wound down, with John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho as the first-choice defensive pairing. When Carvalho was injured, manager Mourinho paired Terry with Ghanaian midfielder Michael Essien.\n\nBoulahrouz joined Spanish club Sevilla on a year-long loan for the 2007–08 season. However, he played just six games for them and was deemed surplus to requirements. He returned to Chelsea in 2008 but was not given a squad number and made no appearances.\n\nOn 21 July 2008, Boulahrouz moved to VfB Stuttgart for a fee of around €5 million. He struggled in his first three seasons. Early in the 2011–12 Bundesliga season, however, Khalid became a regular in the starting line-up. The 29-year-old defender had his 100th cap in the top German league on 17 September 2011 at SC Freiburg. Two weeks later, Boulahrouz scored his first goal (only his second in the Bundesliga) for Stuttgart on 30 September 2011. His goal came in the 69th minute of a 2–0 win over 1. FC Kaiserslautern.\n\nIn May 2012 VfB Stuttgart announced that his expiring contract would not be extended.\n\nOn 18 July 2012, Boulahrouz signed a two-year contract with Sporting Clube de Portugal. He made 11 league appearances for the club, and on 3 September 2013 his contract was terminated.\n\nOn 7 October 2013, Boulahrouz signed a contract which is due until the summer 2014. The transfer was confirmed after many weeks of negotiating. He made 13 league appearances for Brøndby IF that season. Boulahrouz had quite a lot of injuries during his stay at Brøndby, which was one of the reasons why a new contract was not discussed.\n\nOn 14 July 2014, it was officially announced that Boulahrouz had signed a one-year contract with Feyenoord on a free transfer. He was one of the replacements for outgoing defenders Stefan de Vrij, Daryl Janmaat and Bruno Martins Indi after their performances for the Netherlands at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. On 11 February 2016, more than half a year after his contract with Feyenoord had expired, Boulahrouz announced his retirement from professional football.\n\nBoulahrouz' displays for RKC caused Marco van Basten to pick him for the Netherlands national football team. He made his international début on 3 September 2004 in a 3–0 win for the Netherlands against Liechtenstein, and was named in the squad for the 2006 World Cup. He managed 34 caps for the national team, as of November 2011.\n\nBoulahrouz was sent off from the Netherlands match against Portugal in the 2006 FIFA World Cup Round of Sixteen after a second bookable offence. He was judged to have used an elbow on Portugal's Luís Figo. Before that, he was first booked in the seventh minute after a violent tackle that injured Cristiano Ronaldo, eventually forcing the substitution of the Portuguese player. Referee Valentin Ivanov issued a total of 16 yellow cards and four red cards in this match, a World Cup record.\n\nHaving initially missed the cut for the Dutch Euro 2008 squad, following an injury to Liverpool's Ryan Babel, he was reinstated to the 23-man squad. He was chosen to start in the group games.\n\nBoulahrouz was included in the preliminary squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. On 27 May 2010, Netherlands manager Bert van Marwijk announced that the player would be part of the final squad of 23 participating in the competition. Boulahrouz started in the Netherlands last 2010 World Cup group match on 24 June and helped the Dutch team to a 2–1 win over Cameroon. He also played in the semi-final against Uruguay in place of Gregory van der Wiel.\n\nGoalkeeper and international teammate Edwin van der Sar said of Boulahrouz \"He is an important defender, but he is also the man to lift spirits within the squad. He is the sort of guy you need around during long evenings at training camp.\" Former Dutch centre-back Jaap Stam said that Boulahrouz could become his successor.\n\n"}

He was an officer of the Continental Army in the American Revolution, a Continental Congressman, and a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, who served in the Delaware General Assembly and as a United States Representative from Delaware.\n\nPatten was born at \"Tynhead Court,\" near Dover in the Delaware Colony, son of John Patten and Ann Maxwell. This property was on the present Dover Air Force Base, near the farms of Caesar Rodney and John Dickinson. He was a farmer, who after the American Revolution married Ann Haslet, daughter of the first Colonel of the 1st Delaware Regiment, John Haslet. She died soon thereafter, and he married Mary Miller Loockerman, daughter of the Rev. John Miller and widow of Vincent Loockerman.\n\nPatten was commissioned a first lieutenant in Captain John Caldwell's 2nd Company of the 1st Delaware Regiment at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War. He was soon promoted to captain of the 1st Company and in February 1779 and was promoted to the rank of major. He fought in every major battle from the Battle of Long Island until the Battle of Camden, where the Delaware Regiment suffered grievous losses, and he was taken prisoner. Paroled in 1781, after the fighting was over, he is said to have walked home alone in rags from Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nPatten was elected in 1785 to the State House or House of Assembly, as it was then known, and represented Kent County, during the 1785/86 session. At the same time he was elected to the Continental Congress in 1785 and served there one year. He won a closely contested election to the U.S. House in 1792 and took his seat in the U.S. House on March 4, 1793. However, Henry Latimer, the Federal candidate contested the election, claiming that many ballots were invalid because they were filled out incorrectly. After a lengthy study the Federalist majority in the U.S. House voted on February 14, 1794 to invalidate enough ballots to award the seat to Latimer. A few months later Patten again defeated Latimer, and this time served the whole term, from March 4, 1795 until March 3, 1797. Brought out of political retirement in 1800, Patten was defeated for the U.S. House seat by the incumbent Federalist James A. Bayard.\n\nPatten died at his home, Tynhead Court, near Dover, and is buried in the Old Presbyterian Cemetery, which is at Dover, on the grounds of the Delaware State Museum. He had a home on the north side of Front Street, between Orange and Tatnall Streets in Wilmington, Delaware, but was always a legal resident of Kent County. He was active in the Philadelphia Society for promoting Agriculture, the Society of the Cincinnati, and the Lyceum of Delaware.\n\nElections were held October 1. Members of the General Assembly took office on October 20 or the following weekday. The State Assemblymen were elected for a one-year term. They chose the Continental Congressmen for a one-year term. U.S. Representatives took office March 4 and have a two-year term.\n\nAfter 1792 elections were moved to the first Tuesday of October and members of the General Assembly took office on the first Tuesday of January. The State Legislative Council was renamed the State Senate and the State House of Assembly was renamed the State House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was discovered on 17 July 1948, by American astronomer Carl Wirtanen at Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton, California. The stony S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 10.2 hours and measures approximately in diameter. It is named for Betulia Toro Herrick, wife of astronomer Samuel Herrick.\n\n\"Toro\" is an Apollo asteroid, a subgroup of near-Earth asteroids that cross the orbit of Earth. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.8–2.0 AU once every 584 days. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.44 and an inclination of 9° with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThis asteroid's orbit also shows a 5:8 resonance with Earth and in a near 5:13 resonance with Venus. It was the third Apollo asteroid to be discovered. The current resonance with Earth will last for only a few thousand years. Calculations show that \"Toro\" will leave it in 2960 CE, and that it will enter the region of 5:13 resonance with Venus in 3470 CE. This is because the distance from Earth's orbit will become larger and that from Venus's orbit smaller. A study of long-term stability shows that the alternating resonances will possibly be broken roughly 3 million years from now because of close approaches between \"Toro\" and Mars.\n\nBased on orbital paths, \"Toro\" is the best candidate for the source of the Sylacauga meteorite, the first meteorite authenticated to have struck a human, Mrs. Ann Hodges of Sylacauga, Alabama on 30 November 1954. \"Toro\"s Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of , is just above the 0.05 AU requirement to be listed as a potentially hazardous asteroid. With an orbital uncertainty \"U\" = 0, its orbit and future close approaches are well determined.\n\nThis minor planet was named after the maiden name of Betulia Herrick, wife of American astronomer Samuel Herrick. Herrick had studied the asteroid's orbit, and requested the name, along with the other asteroid, 1580 Betulia. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 10 March 1966 ().\n\nIn the Tholen and SMASS taxonomic scheme, \"Toro\" is characterized as a stony S-type asteroid. It is reported to be composed of L chondrite with a high albedo in the range of 0.24–0.34. It has an extremely well-measured rotation period of 10.2 hours.\n\n"}

It is located southwest of the city, in Bouguenais.\n\nThe airport is operated by the \"Chambre de commerce et d'industrie de Nantes\". It is currently the third largest airport in the west of France (after Toulouse-Blagnac and Bordeaux-Mérignac), with a maximum capacity of three million passengers a year. In 2019, the airport handled 7,221,000 passengers, an increase of 16.6% compared to 2018.\n\nNantes airport owes its origins to a military airfield, conceived in 1928 on part of the current site. In 1936/7 the Société Nationale de Constructions Aéronautiques de l'Ouest opened an aircraft factory adjacent to the airfield, initially building MB.210 bombers, followed by M.S.406 fighters and LeO 45 bombers. In 1939 the first paved runway was constructed, with a length of .\n\nDuring World War II the airfield was briefly used as a British Royal Air Force airfield before being captured by German forces. Under occupation the aircraft factory was closed, and the airfield was used by the Luftwaffe as an airfield to bomb targets in England. As a consequence the airfield was hit by a damaging air raid on 4 July 1943, which also destroyed the adjoining aircraft factory.\n\nAfter the war the airfield was again put into service by the French Air Force. The aircraft factory was rebuilt, and has since built sections of the Vautour fighter and the Caravelle airliner, before becoming part of Airbus. In 1951 the first commercial operations started, with a new terminal built between 1954 and 1960 and runway extensions to cater for larger aircraft.\n\nNantes Atlantique is currently the largest airport in the west of France. There were plans to have it replaced by an Aéroport du Grand Ouest, situated to the north-west of Nantes in the 'commune' of Notre-Dame-des-Landes. The €580 million project was approved in February 2008, with plans to open it in 2017. However, after a nearly 40-year-long controversy regarding the usefulness and impact of such an airport, the project was officially cancelled on 17 January 2018.\n\nThe airport has a single 'L' shaped passenger terminal, which is divided into four numbered halls. Halls 1 to 3 form the long side of the 'L' and are zones within the same two story building, with baggage claim and check-in facilities on the ground floor, and departure lounges on the upper level. Hall 4 occupies a later single story building at right angles to the earlier building, but connected to it by a lobby.\n\nThe airport also has a separate freight terminal, situated to the south of the passenger terminal, which includes of entrepôt storage. Also situated close to the passenger terminal is the Nantes factory of Airbus, which specialises in the construction of the centre wing box of the Airbus fleet of airliners and in the use of composite materials for creating structural components.\n\nRegional, a regional airline, was headquartered on the grounds of Nantes Atlantique Airport. In 2013 the airline merged into HOP!\n\nNantes Atlantique Airport is located just outside the \"Périphérique de Nantes\", the city's peripheral ring motorway, to which it is linked by a short access road. All the major roads and motorways to and from the city of Nantes intersect the 'périphérique'. Several car parks, both in the open and under cover, are located in the terminal area, with each car park having its own tariff.\n\nAn express shuttle bus, the 'Navette Tan Air', links the a stop outside the airport terminal to Nantes railway station and the city centre. The service forms part of Nantes's Tan public transport network, but charges a Tan Air fare, which is higher than the standard network fare, for the full journey. Alternatively the shuttle can be used to reach Neustrie, where a connection can be made to line 3 of the Tan tram system, using standard network fares.\n\n"}

In most, the casque has a spongy structure, but in the helmeted hornbill it is solid keratin. This material, hornbill ivory, has a texture suggesting ivory but is softer. As it grows it is golden yellow, but the bird rubs its casque on its preen gland, whose oily secretion tints the surface of the casque bright red.\n\nNative peoples in the helmeted hornbill's range, such as the Kenyah and Kelabit, have long carved the casques. In Malaysia, hornbill-ivory rings were said to change colour when near poisonous food. The Chinese encountered the material in the 14th century and it soon became an important trade item at Brunei. According to Tom Harrisson, writing in the first (1960) edition of \"The Birds of Borneo\":\nIt is likely that the casques were mainly exported raw, and worked with a heat treatment and pressing - of which no detailed description survives - in China, to preserve and heighten the lovely deep golden and surface red patina of the fresh ivory. The Chinese probably got the idea of using \"ho-ting\" from the Dayaks, then improved the technique at their end. The uses of hornbill casques in Borneo are various and frequently effective; we will discuss those presently. While the Borneo usages persist to this day, all trace of the art of the Chinese carver seems to have vanished. Very little has survived of a remarkable craft which undoubtedly paid for many of the old jars, plates, and beads still decorating the longhouses or wives of better-off Bornean pagans many generations later.\n\nDuring the Ming dynasty, the Chinese valued hornbill ivory above true ivory or jade. They carved the casques, or made them into sheets, coloured them with the secretion of the preen gland, and made them into belt buckles for high officials. They called hornbill ivory \"hèdǐng\" (Wade–Giles \"ho-ting\"), which is said to be their approximation of an indigenous name (but means \"crane head\", and thus many Chinese thought the substance came from a crane rather than a hornbill). The Japanese also carved imported hornbill ivory into such objects as \"netsuke\".\n\nBy the early 20th century, the helmeted hornbill became rare because it was slaughtered for its casque. Now legal trade in hornbill ivory is limited to certified antiques, and hornbill-ivory carvings are more valuable than those of any true ivory.\n\n\n"}

He also collaborated on some periodicals for children at this time, and later, on comic books and newspaper supplements.\n\nJan returned to Spain in 1969, and worked in the now defunct publishing house Editorial Bruguera until 1985 where he helped illustrate the work of other comic book artists. \n\nIn 1973, however, Jan created Superlópez, a parodized version of Superman. It was a series that began as a single page and later expanded into full albums, with adventures involving supervillains and criminal organizations.

After attending school in Husum and at the Christianeum Hamburg, and studying law at the University of Jena (1757-1759), he entered 1760 the Danish military service and took later part in the Russian campaign of 1762. He spent the next twelve years in Copenhagen, where he was intimate with Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. His military period ends in the year 1771. Von Gerstenberg was a Danish deputy in a \"German Chamber\" and was an assessor in the \"Commercial Deputation\" up to 1775.\n\nFrom 1775 to 1783 he represented Denmark's interests as Danish Resident at Lübeck, and in 1786 received a judicial appointment at Altona, where he died in November 1823.\n\nIn the course of his long life, Gerstenberg passed through many phases of his nation's literature. He began as an imitator of the Anacreontic school (Tändeleyen, 1759); then wrote, in imitation of Gleim, \"Kriegslieder eines dänischen Grenadiers\" (1762); with his \"Gedicht eines Skalden\" (1766) he joined the group of bards led by Klopstock. He translated Beaumont and Fletcher's \"Maid's Tragedy\" (1767), and helped to usher in the Sturm und Drang period with a gruesome but powerful tragedy, \"Ugolino\" (1768). But he did perhaps even better service to the new literary movement with his \"Briefe über Merkwürdigkeiten der Litteratur\" (1766-1770), in which the critical principles of the Sturm und Drang, and especially its enthusiasm for Shakespeare, were first definitely formulated. In later life Gerstenberg lost touch with literature, and occupied himself mainly with Kant's philosophy.\n\nHis \"Vermischte Schriften\" appeared in 3 vols. (1815).

P. Lovecraft into the lore of the Cthulhu Mythos.\n\nLudvig Prinn's \"Mysteries of the Worm\" first appeared in Bloch's short story \"he Secret in the Tomb\" (\"Weird Tales\" May 1935). Lovecraft coined the Latin title, \"De Vermis Mysteriis.\" \n\nThis analogue to Lovecraft's Necronomicon also features strongly in Bloch's story \"The Shambler from the Stars\" (1935), in which a character reads a passage from the book and accidentally summons an extradimensional horror.\n\nBloch, then a teenager, corresponded with Lovecraft about the story prior to its publication, in part to get permission to kill off a character based on the older writer. While giving his enthusiastic blessing, Lovecraft also provided Bloch with a bit of Latin to use as an invocation from the book: \"Tibi, magnum Innominandum, signa stellarum nigrarum et bufoniformis Sadoquae sigillum\"—which can be translated as \"To you, the great Not-to-Be-Named, signs of the black stars, and the seal of the toad-shaped Tsathoggua\".\n\nIn \"The Shambler from the Stars\", \"De Vermis Mysteriis\" is described as the work of Ludvig Prinn, an \"alchemist, necromancer, [and] reputed mage\" who \"boasted of having attained a miraculous age\" before being burned at the stake in Brussels during the height of the witch trials (in the late 15th or early 16th centuries).\n\nPrinn, Bloch writes, maintained that he was captured during the Ninth Crusade in 1271, and attributed his occult knowledge to studying under the \"wizards and wonder-workers of Syria\" during his captivity. Bloch also associates Prinn with Egypt, writing that \"there are legends among the Libyan dervishes concerning the old seer's deeds in Alexandria.\"\n\nAt the time of his execution for sorcery, Bloch has Prinn living \"in the ruins of a pre-Roman tomb that stood in the forest near Brussels...amidst a swarm of familiars and fearsomely invoked conjurations.\" In this forest, there were \"old pagan altars that stood crumbling in certain of the darker glens\"; these altars were found to have \"fresh bloodstains\" when Prinn was arrested.\n\nIn its first appearance, Bloch describes the book as containing \"spells and enchantments\", particularly those that can summon strange entities. One such spell, included in a \"chapter dealing with familiars,\" summons the titular \"shambler from the stars\"—referred to in the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game as a star vampire. The story also notes that that book contains references to \"such gods of divination as Father Yig, dark Han, and serpent-bearded Byatis\"—this last the first mention of a Cthulhoid entity later developed by Ramsey Campbell.\n\nIn a subsequent series of Cthulhu Mythos stories connected with Ancient Egypt, Bloch expanded on the contents of \"De Vermis Mysteriis\". \"The Faceless God\" (1936) notes that Prinn \"awesomely implies his knowledge\" of Nyarlathotep, \"the oldest god of all Egypt\". In \"The Brood of Bubastis\", \"The Secret of Sebek\", and \"Fane of the Black Pharaoh\" (all published in 1937), Bloch refers to a chapter of Prinn's book called \"Saracenic Rituals\", which is said to have \"revealed the lore of the efreet and the djinn, the secrets of the Assassin sects, the myths of Arabian ghoul-tales, the hidden practices of dervish cults\" and \"the legends of Inner Egypt\". These stories use Prinn's chapter as a device to provide backstory on the cults of Bubastis and Sebek, and on the Pharaoh Nephren-Ka's worship of Nyarlathotep.\n\nIn later, non-Mythos horror stories, Bloch still occasionally made reference to his invented tome. Bloch's \"The Sorcerer's Jewel\" (1939) briefly mentions \"Prinn's chapter on divination\" as a potential source for information on \"The Star of Sechmet\", a mysterious crystal. The book plays a larger role in \"Black Bargain\" (1942), in which it is described as\n\n\"Philtre Tip\" (1961), quite literally a shaggy dog story, cites \"Ludvig Prinn's \"Grimoire\", in the English edition\", as the source for the recipe for a love potion. Bloch quotes Prinn for the first time since \"The Shambler from the Stars\": \"The meerest droppe, if placed in a posset of wine or sack, will transforme ye beloved into a veritable bitche in heate.\"\n\nLovecraft, who enjoyed sprinkling references to his friends' fictional creations in his own Cthulhu Mythos efforts, repeatedly mentioned \"De Vermis Mysteriis\" in his stories. It appears in \"The Haunter of the Dark\" (written as a sequel to Bloch's \"The Shambler from the Stars\") as a \"hellish\" book found with other forbidden texts in the Starry Wisdom Church in Providence, Rhode Island. In \"The Diary of Alonzo Typer\", ghostwritten by Lovecraft for William Lumley, it is likewise part of an occult library in the van der Heyl house near Attica, New York. And in Lovecraft's \"The Shadow Out of Time\", the possessed protagonist Wingate Peaslee reads (and makes marginal notes in) a copy of the book possessed by the Miskatonic University library.\n\nIn a 1936 letter to fellow Mythos writer Henry Kuttner, Lovecraft mentioned \"De Vermis Mysteriis\" as one of the books that \"repeat the most hellish secrets learnt by early man\".\n\nRobert M. Price has suggested that Kuttner, by giving the name \"Abigail Prinn\" to the villain of his short story \"The Salem Horror\", may have been suggesting that the Salem witch Abigail was a descendant of the Brussels sorcerer. In any case, Kuttner explicitly made use of \"De Vermis Mysteriis\" in his 1939 short story \"The Invaders\", in which disregard of the book's precautions (\"the Pnakotic pentagon, the cabalistical signs of protection...\") brings forth the horrors of the story's title—said to be described by Prinn as \"the dwellers in the Hidden World\".\n\nIn his short story \"The Adventure of the Six Silver Spiders\" (1950), August Derleth includes \"De Vermis Mysteriis\" among a group of Cthulhu Mythos volumes discovered in a book catalog by his detective character Solar Pons—though in the context of the story, all the books turn out to be fictional.\n\nBoth Ludwig Prinn and the \"De Vermis Mysteriis\" are mentioned by name in \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" (1975), as being connected to the Illuminati.\n\n\"De Vermis Mysteriis\" is featured in a Lovecraftian story by horror writer Stephen King entitled \"Jerusalem's Lot\" (1978)—part of the \"Night Shift\" collection, wherein the main character, Charles, touches the book and releases a gigantic white worm, which was worshiped by the town's previous inhabitants. It is also implied that book is found by Mark and Susan in the novel/semi-sequel \"'Salem's Lot\". In a passage, Mark finds a book in the Marsten House and asks Susan to translate it for him. She doesn't know what it says, but she says it's in Latin, possibly referencing the book's title.

An extremely hardy pioneer plant, it is tolerant of drought and poor soil, often being the only cover on new road cuttings or verges. It has bright yellow latex. It is poisonous to grazing animals, and it is rarely eaten, but it has been used medicinally by many peoples, including those in its native area, as well as the Natives of the western US, parts of Mexico and many parts of India. In India, during the colorful festival Holika Dahan, adults and children worship by offering flowers, and this species is in its maximum flowering phase during March when the Holi festival is celebrated. It is also referred to as \"kateli ka phool” in India.\n\n\"Argemone mexicana\" seeds contain 22–36% of a pale yellow non-edible oil, called \"argemone oil\" or \"katkar oil\", which contains the toxic alkaloids sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine.\nFour quaternary isoquinoline alkaloids, dehydrocorydalmine, jatrorrhizine, columbamine, and oxyberberine, have been isolated from the whole plant of \"Argemone mexicana\".\n\nThe seed pods secrete a pale yellow latex when cut open. This argemone resin contains berberine and protopine.\n\nThe seeds resemble the seeds of \"Brassica nigra\" (mustard). As a result, mustard can be adulterated by argemone seeds, rendering it poisonous. Several significant instances of katkar poisoning have been reported in India, Fiji, South Africa and other countries. The last major outbreak in India occurred in 1998. 1% adulteration of mustard oil by argemone oil has been shown to cause clinical disease. In India, Argemone oil is mixed with sunflower oil and sesame oil to increase the quantity, but this adulteration causes health disorders and renowned brands display \"no argemone oil\" to qualify purity.\nKatkar oil poisoning causes epidemic dropsy, with symptoms including extreme swelling, particularly of the legs.\n\nThe Seri of Sonora, Mexico use the entire plant both fresh and dried. An infusion is made to relieve kidney pain, to help expel a torn placenta, and in general to help cleanse the body post-natally.\n\nWhen the Spanish arrived in Sonora they added this plant to their pharmacopia and called it cardosanto, which should not be mistranslated to blessed thistle (\"Cnicus benedictus\"). The seeds are taken as a laxative.\n\nAn \"Argemone mexicana\" tea is used by traditional healers in Mali to treat malaria. The whole plant is used to make a tea and as much tea as possible is drunk until symptoms disappear. This use has been studied clinically for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. In one study, 73% of patients treated had an adequate clinical response, but very few patients had complete parasite clearance. Another study found that use of \"Argemone mexicana\" may be a suitable first-aid treatment in rural areas when access to other better antimalarials is delayed.\n\nIn Tamilnadu, India, this plant is named bramha thandu. This has many medicinal benefits. Traditionally, the flowers are soaked in water overnight and cleaning the eyes with this water helps improve eyesight. The juice of these leaves helps in treating various skin conditions. This is also used for treating scorpion and snake bites. When the plant is dried and powdered and used as tea or when mixed with honey and consumed, it helps with cough, asthma and improves overall respiratory health. The roots are cleaned, soaked, ground and consumed to eliminate any worms in the intestines. The dry powder is used to brush teeth to prevent any gum problems. In the traditional medicine of India, the yellow sap of \"A. mexicana\" and the whole plant are also used in jaundice therapy.\n\nBiodiesel production from \"A. mexicana\" seed oil using crystalline manganese carbonate has been demonstrated.\n\n"}

He came to public attention in July 2005 when he lost his position with the newspaper after being named as a member of the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir. \"The Guardian\" was alerted to Aslam's membership in the group by bloggers who read Aslam's 'Comment' op-ed article on the 7 July London bombings. Entitled \"We Rock the Boat,\" the 13 July article discussed the attitudes of young British Muslims and how their increasing anger over perceived injustices contrasted with their elders' silence.\n\nBefore joining \"The Guardian\", Aslam had written three articles for Khilafah.com, a website closely associated with Hizb ut-Tahrir, and was once called its Middle Eastern correspondent. The newspaper stated that after publication of \"We Rock the Boat,\" it found an article on Khalifah.com, that appeared to be an \"incitement of violence against Jews.\" Aslam told Alan Rusbridger, \"The Guardian's\" editor, that he personally rejected anti-Semitism, would not leave Hizb ut-Tahrir, and did not consider Khilafah.com anti-Semitic. Rusbridger and other executives decided that membership in Hizb ut-Tahrir was not compatible with membership in the trainee scheme.\n\nAslam studied journalism at Sheffield University with the help of a bursary from the \"Sheffield Star\". Previously he had been a journalistic trainee at the \"Matlock Mercury\" in 2004, and won the National Union of Journalists George Viner award for promising black journalists in 2003.\n\nAslam wrote or co-wrote a number of news articles on the London bombings. Then, in a 13 July 2005 opinion piece entitled \"We Rock the Boat\", he wrote to condemn the bombings but also to tell readers that \"If, as police announced yesterday, four men (at least three from Yorkshire) blew themselves up in the name of Islam, then please let us do ourselves a favour and not act shocked,\" as \"the attack was inevitable\" and the result of civilian Iraqi casualties following the US invasion of that country. He went on to suggest that there was a gulf between younger and older generations of British Muslims, and that the younger generation was no longer prepared to suffer perceived injustices in silence. Specifically, he described recent personal experiences at Leeds and Sheffield mosques, in which community religious leaders failed to mention the November 2004 US-Iraqi-British assault on Fallujah, Iraq, which many British Muslims were angry about. The article begins as follows:\nIf I'm asked about 7/7, I – a Yorkshire lad, born and bred – will respond first by giving an out-clause to being labelled a terrorist lover. I think what happened in London was a sad day and not the way to express your political anger. Then there's the \"but.\" If, as police announced yesterday, four men (at least three from Yorkshire) blew themselves up in the name of Islam, then please let us do ourselves a favour and not act shocked.\nScott Burgess, a conservative American blogger living in London, searched for Aslam's name on the Internet and discovered that he was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, had written articles for its website, Khilafah.com, and quoted the BBC as saying the HT website \"promotes racism and anti-Semitic hatred, calls suicide bombers martyrs, and urges Muslims to kill Jewish people.\". A blogging campaign soon began, supported by notable left and right-wing blogs, and taken up by some of the mainstream press, to get Aslam sacked. At first, \"The Guardian\" appeared to stand by its employee, but he was finally given his notice for refusing to end his membership in Hizb ut-Tahrir. \"The Guardian\" said it had been unaware of his membership of the party, and that \"on his 15-page application form he did not mention that he was a member of the Islamist political party, Hizb ut-Tahrir, despite being invited to describe any participation in public affairs or political campaigning.\" However it also noted that after joining the Guardian, Aslam \"made no secret of his membership of this political party, drawing it to the attention of several colleagues and some senior editors.\" It was also said he submitted his work for Hizb ut-Tahrir's website as part of his application.\nOn announcing that Aslam had been dismissed, \"The Guardian\" published a story describing how the blog campaign had unfolded, calling it a \"demonstration of the way the 'blogosphere' can be used to mount obsessively personalised attacks at high speed.\" The publication wrote that Scott Burgess had made a failed application for the \"Guardian\" traineeship that had gone to Aslam. Burgess countered that he had only facetiously posted the application on his weblog to entertain his readers. \n\nAslam sued over his premature dismissal from the paper. The Guardian released a statement on 26 May 2006 that it and Alsam \"had reached agreement for the final settlement of an Employment Tribunal claim following the early termination of Mr Aslam's contract as a trainee reporter with the Guardian in July 2005.\"\n"}

He went on to complete his seminary studies at St. Isidore's College in Rome, where, in 1829, he was ordained a Catholic priest. \n\nAfter long service in Ireland — at Ennis, Cork, and Dublin — he was appointed in 1847, coadjutor bishop with right of succession to his fellow friar, Michael Anthony Fleming, O.S.F., Catholic Bishop of St. John's, Newfoundland, for which office he was consecrated by Cardinal Fransoni on 27 December 1847, at St. Isidore's.\n\nIn July, 1850, Mullock succeeded Fleming. The Catholic Church made great progress in Newfoundland during his episcopate of Mullock, a new diocese, Harbour Grace, being erected. \n\nThe cathedral of St. John's, begun in 1841, was consecrated on 9 September 1855. He also opened in 1857 St Bonaventure's, a school for middle-class boys, a new episcopal palace and library, eleven convents, and numerous churches.\n\nMullock took a keen interest in the commercial development of Newfoundland, and was enthusiastic about its natural resources. \n\nHe was frequently consulted by the Governor on matters relating to the welfare of the country, and many of his suggestions relating to the fisheries and other matters were adopted. \n\nBefore leaving Ireland he was a frequent contributor to the periodical literature of the day, and took an active part in the Irish literary movement of the 1840s.\n\nLong before the first attempts to lay a submarine cable across the Atlantic was made (1857), Mullock had on several occasions publicly propounded the feasibility of connecting Europe with North America by means of submarine telegraph. \n\nA good linguist in Spanish, French, and Italian, he was the first to bring before the English-speaking world the life and works of the Redemptorist founder and theologian, Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori, publishing his \"Life\" at Dublin in 1846, and in the following year a translation of the saint's \"History of Heresies and their Refutation\". \n\nIn 1847, appeared at Dublin his \"Short History of the Irish Franciscan Province\" translated from the Latin work of Francis Ward; he also wrote \"The Cathedral of St. John's, Newfoundland and its consecration\" (Dublin, 1856) and published \"Two Lectures on Newfoundland\"(New York, 1860).\n\nUnlike his predecessor, Mullock regarded himself as a Newfoundlander, and not just an Irish missionary, and was eager to profess local nuns and ordain local priests. Believing that \"It is the duty of a Bishop to aid and advise his people in all their struggles for justice\", he took an active part in political life.\n\nWhen, in 1852, the Colonial Office refused to grant responsible government to Newfoundland, Mullock denounced it in extreme terms in a published letter. He and his priests became active and open supporters of the Liberal Party, which became the government when responsible government was granted three years later in 1855. \n\nBut he soon became disillusioned with politicians \"who take care of themselves, and do nothing for the people\". When the government finally fell, he nevertheless urged Catholics to vote for it, probably because the Anglican Bishop Edward Feild had endorsed the Conservatives. \n\nIn the ensuing election and its aftermath he pursued a somewhat inflammatory course culminating in his putting the inhabitants of Cat's Cove under the Episcopal Ban for political actions which displeased him.\n\nHowever, in his later years Mullock threw his influence on the side of order, reminding his people that \"the powers that be are ordained of God\".\n\nWhen Mullock died the Governor, Sir Anthony Musgrave, attended the Requiem Mass, all the flags flew at half-mast, and all the shops closed. He and his contemporary Feild, the Anglican Bishop, were among the most influential people in nineteenth century Newfoundland.\n\n"}
{"id": "2320441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320441", "title": "Connotations (Copland)", "text": "Connotations (Copland)\n\nConnotations is a classical music composition for symphony orchestra written by American composer Aaron Copland. Commissioned by Leonard Bernstein in 1962 to commemorate the opening of Philharmonic Hall (now David Geffen Hall at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts) in New York City, United States, this piece marks a departure from Copland's populist period, which began with \"El Salón México\" in 1936 and includes the works he is most famous for such as \"Appalachian Spring\", \"Lincoln Portrait\" and \"Rodeo\". It represents a return to a more dissonant style of composition in which Copland wrote from the end of his studies with French pedagogue Nadia Boulanger and return from Europe in 1924 until the Great Depression. It was also Copland's first dodecaphonic work for orchestra, a style he had disparaged until he heard the music of French composer Pierre Boulez and adapted the method for himself in his \"Piano Quartet\" of 1950. While the composer had produced other orchestral works contemporary to \"Connotations\", it was his first purely symphonic work since his Third Symphony, written in 1947.\n\n\"Connotations\" was received negatively upon its premiere for its harmonic assertiveness and compositional style. The overall impression at the time was that, as critic Alex Ross later phrased it, \"Copland was no longer in an ingratiating mood.\" The composer was accused by some critics of betraying his role as a tonal, populist composer to curry favor with younger composers and give the impression that his music still held contemporary relevance. Copland denied this accusation; he asserted that he had written \"Connotations\" as a twelve-tone work to give himself compositional options not available had he written it as a tonal one.\n\nPart of the blame for \"Connotations\"' initial failure has been ascribed by Copland biographer Howard Pollack, among others, to Bernstein's \"harsh and overblown\" conducting. Bernstein, known in the classical music community as a long-time champion of Copland's music, had programmed the composer's pieces more frequently with the New York Philharmonic than those of any other living composer. However, these performances were mainly of works from the composer's populist period, with which the conductor was in full sympathy. He was less comfortable in pieces that were atonal or rhythmically disjunctive. While Bernstein might have performed the work purely out of service to an old friend, he was apparently unable to interpret this work persuasively. Subsequent performances with New York Philharmonic during its 1963 European tour and a 1999 all-Copland concert showed that the situation had not changed. Bad acoustics might have also played a part in the work's lack of success at its premiere.\n\nMore recent performances, led by conductors Pierre Boulez, Edo de Waart and Sixten Ehrling, have been acknowledged to show the music in a more positive light. Nevertheless, the overall reputation of the music remains mixed. Some critics, including composer John Adams, have remained critical of the work and considered Copland's use of serial techniques detrimental to his later music. Others, which include critics Michael Andrews and Peter Davis, have seen \"Connotations\" as proof of Copland's continued growth and inventiveness as a composer while not downplaying the work's melodic and harmonic harshness and potential difficulty overall for listeners.\n\nAaron Copland wrote \"Connotations\" to fulfill a commission from Leonard Bernstein for the opening concert of the New York Philharmonic's new home in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Since this hall was slated as the first part of Lincoln Center for completion, its inauguration was considered especially momentous. Among the guest list of 2600 for the first concert and the white-tie gala which would follow it were John D. Rockefeller III (chairman of Lincoln Center), Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Governor and Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller, United Nations Secretary General U Thant and prominent figures in the arts that included of Metropolitan Opera General Manager Rudolf Bing, violinist Isaac Stern and actress Merle Oberon. Noted composers would also attend included Samuel Barber, Henry Cowell, Roy Harris, Walter Piston, Richard Rodgers, William Schuman and Roger Sessions. United States President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie had also been invited. Their initial inability to attend caused some consternation, since they had voiced their support for American culture. At the last minute, Jackie Kennedy said she would be there.\n\nCopland was one of ten internationally known composers who accepted invitations to contribute music for the opening. His would be the first new piece to be heard. Other compositions included the Eighth Symphony of American composer William Schuman, an \"Overture Philharmonique\" by French composer Darius Milhaud and \"Andromache's Farewell\" for soprano and orchestra by American composer Samuel Barber. It would also be Copland's first purely symphonic piece since his Third Symphony of 1947, although he had penned orchestral works in a number of genres throughout the 1940s and 50s. According to Taruskin, Copland's receipt of such a commission testified to both his status as a creative figure and his close relationship with the American public. This position was unique among \"serious\" American composers and derived from the populist works he had written in the 1930s and 40s. However, from the 1950s Copland's public works—the ones for which he had developed his populist style—were increasingly written in what he called his \"difficult\" or \"private\" style. That style had become increasingly non-tonal.\n\nCopland began sketching the work early in 1961. To gain composing time, he cancelled his 1962 trip to Tanglewood and determined to stay at home the entire year. Even so, he accepted an invitation to revisit Japan early in 1962 for a United States State Department conference and combined the trip with conducting engagements in Seattle and Vancouver. By June 25, Copland wrote to Mexican composer Carlos Chavez, \"I am working day and night on my symphony for the Philharmonic commission. It is in three movements and I have just finished the last, the first being more than half done.\" Copland then went to Mexico at Chavez's invitation, partly to conduct but mainly to compose. From there, he wrote American composer Leo Smit on July 4 that he was not yet finished and was having trouble finding a title for the new work. He completed the piece in September 1962, just in time for orchestra rehearsals.\n\nWhen he considered the form the work would take, Copland wrote that he \"concluded that the classical masters would undoubtedly provide the festive and dedicatory tone appropriate to such an occasion.\" He therefore decided to offer \"a contemporary note,\" one that would reflect \"the tensions, aspirations and drama inherent in the world today.\" This tension, he explained in 1975, \"is inherent in the nature of the chordal structures, and in the general character of the piece.\"\n\n\"Connotations\" is scored for full symphony orchestra with augmented percussion. The complete ensemble includes piccolo, three flutes (third flute doubling second piccolo), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, E-flat clarinet, bass clarinet, three bassoons (third bassoon doubling contrabassoon), six horns, four trumpets, four trombones, tuba, tympani, five percussionists (glockenspiel, vibraphone, xylophone, conga drums, timbales, cymbals, metal sheet, tam-tam, triangle, claves, temple block, woodblock, bass drum, snare drum, tenor drum), piano (doubling celesta) and strings.\n\nA typical performance of this work lasts 20 minutes.\n\n\"Connotations\" is twelve-tone, a style of composition which is among the first introduced, and certainly most well known, forms of musical Serialism. Through this technique, Copland wrote that he felt he could express \"something of the tensions, aspirations and drama\" of that time. Three four-note chords, musicologist Neil Butterworth writes, spell out the 12-note row on two trumpets and two trombones. Each chord is separated by echoes from the remaining trumpets and trombones, which also introduces one of the work's main rhythmic elements. The row is repeated, transposed up an augmented fourth with a different distribution of notes within each chord. The chords \"are repeated several times in various transpositions\" so they can become firmly established in both the musical fabric and the listener's ear.\n\nFrom these chords, Copland builds an overall structure that he calls \"closest to a free treatment of the baroque form of the chaconne,\" with a succession of variations \"based on the opening chords and their implied melodic intervals.\" A series of variations alternate fast and slow sections, which according to Copland biographer Howard Pollack creates a complex structure overall. This structure forms a musical arch, sectioned ABCBA. Pollack calls the A sections \"prophetic, tragic,\" the B sections \"jazzy, frentic [sic]\" and the C section \"pastoral, reflective.\" While these are all moods long familiar to listeners of Copland's music, Pollack asserts, \"a new darkness hangs over the whole. The outer sections are grave; the jazzy sections rather cheerless; the pastoral contrast more weary than peaceful. The music often seems lost, uncertain, trapped.\" The piece ends in a series of strict 12-note chords that Copland called \"aggregates.\"\n\nBoth Chavez and American composer David Diamond were confused initially about what musical form \"Connotations\" would take. The work's title seemed to give no clear indication, they said, and Chavez told Copland that he found \"Connotations\" too abstract. As Copland explained to both men and later wrote, in selecting the title, he took the dictionary meaning of the word \"connote\" to imply or signify meanings in addition to the primary one as an impetus for musical exploration.\n\nButterworth writes, \"\"Connotations\" is an essay in contrasts that do not destroy the inherent unity: the chordal writing gives way to outbursts of complex counterpoint.\" The entire composition, Copland explains, is derived from the \"three harsh chords\" with which it begins. Each of these chords contained four notes of the twelve-note row upon which the work is based. \"When spelled out horizontally,\" they supplied him \"with various versions of a more lyrical discourse.\" This \"skeletal frame of the row,\" he told Diamond and Chavez, was the \"primary meaning\" and as such denoted the area which would be explored in the course of the piece. \"The subsequent treatment,\" he explained, \"seeks out other implications—connotations that come in a flash or connotations that the composer himself may gradually uncover.\" From there, the listener was \"free to discover his or her own connotative meanings, including perhaps some not suspected by the author.\n\nOverall, both Pollack and the composer label \"Connotations\" as one of three works written in \"the grand manner,\" as Copland wrote about his Third Symphony. The other two works in this category were the \"Symphonic Ode\" and the Third Symphony. Copland also calls those works transitional pieces, anomalies which stand between different compositional styles of his oeuvre. All three works proved, as musicologist William W. Austin notes and Pollack states about the symphony, \"challenging to grasp.\" While music historian Judith Tick notes the work's \"massive chordal assaults on the ear,\" she adds that while Copland 's stated intent was to evoke the dissonance of modern life, he also acknowledges \"the darkness revealed in such early works from the 1920s as the \"Symphonic Ode\" and \"Piano Variations\".\"\n\nAs for details, Pollack elaborates in his biography of the composer about the similarity of \"Connotations\" to the \"Ode\" in its overall length, single-movement form, solemn tone and \"hard-edged\" orchestration. Butterworth points out that both works are structured as an arch composed of five sections. The first section, slow and chordal, gives way to a scherzo. The third section is slower, followed by another scherzo and a finale which restates passages taken from the opening. The rhythmic patterns in both pieces resemblance each other. This would have been no surprise, Butterworth writes, since Copland revised that score in 1955. Pollock states that another work that might have been fresh on the composer's mind was his \"Nonet\" for strings, composed in 1960, which also employs an arch form.\n\nThe melodic lines' wide leaps and arpeggios are not far removed from those in the \"Short Symphony\", written 30 years earlier, and the prevalence of the interval of the minor ninth hearkens back to his \"Orchestral Variations\", as does his use of alternating fast and slow sections.\n\nThe premiere, on September 23, 1962, \"sent shock waves through the world of music,\" according to Alexander J. Morin, with a reaction by the initial audience, according to Taruskin, of near-silence and incomprehension. Copland noted that the general impression \"was that the premiere was not a congenial circumstance,\" with the music not considered important as the sound of the new concert hall. His effort to present something not bland or traditional for such an occasion and distinguished audience \"was not appreciated at the time.\" Also, Taruskin states, Copland had become an emblem of success in the eyes of the American public. The fact he had written a twelve-tone composition for such an occasion seemed a repudiation of the audience he had won through years of hard effort.\n\nThe overall impression, as critic Alex Ross writes in his book \"The Rest is Noise,\" was that \"Copland was no longer in an ingratiating mood; some sudden rage welled up in him, some urge to confront the gala Lincoln Center audience with an old whiff of revolutionary mystique.\" Copland himself remembers, \"The acidulous harmonies of my score ... upset a good many people, especially those who were expecting another \"Appalachian Spring\".\" Jacqueline Kennedy was left unable to say anything other than \"Oh, Mr. Copland\" when taken backstage during intermission to meet with the composer. When Copland later asked Verna Fine, wife of American composer Irving Fine, what this meant, Fine answered, \"Oh, Aaron, it's obvious. She hated your piece!\" In \"Variety\", Robert J. Landry called \"Connotations\" \"an assault on [the audience's] nervous systems\" and added, \"Seldom has this reviewer heard such outspoken comment in the lobbies after such dull response. It is strictly accurate to declare that an audience paying $100 a seat and in mood for self-congratulation and schmaltz hated Copland's reminder of the ugly realities of industrialization, inflation and cold war—which his music seems to be talking about.\"\n\nA minority of apparently more discerning listeners felt that \"Connotations\" was the right music for its time and place. Composer Arthur Berger states, \"I think [Copland] wrote exactly the piece he wanted to write because he wanted to make a statement about the new Philharmonic Hall in New York—it wasn't going to be a temple of easy listening, as it were, but a place for serious music-making.\" Minna Lederman Daniel, a music writer and editor of \"Modern Music\" magazine, told Copland, \"I think \"Connotations\" was the right place for the people and the occasion—indeed the only one properly related to them. It sounds a good deal like certain aspects of the building—big, spacious, clear, long-lined, and it sounds very like you ... To those familiar with your music, the characteristic, identifying moods are perfectly apparent. The special Copland eloquence is there.\"\n\nA few critics were positive. Louis Biancolli wrote in \"The New York Telegram\" that the work was \"a turning point in [Copland's] career, a powerful score in 12-tone style that has liberated new stores of creative energy.\" John Molleson write for the \"New York Herald Tribune\" that while the new piece was \"a difficult work and like most music difficult to understand at one hearing ... this piece has flesh where others have only skin, and there was a good deal of arresting lyricism.\" Others, however, dismissed \"Connotations\": Everett Helm thought it \"unnecessarily strident,\" Harriet Johnson \"too long for its content\" and Richard Franko Johnson \"completely without charm.\"\n\nThe concert was telecast live by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) to an audience of 26 million viewers. As part of its program, NBC asked Copland to talk to the television audience about \"Connotations\". While the cameras alternated between shots of the composer and the manuscript score, Copland said, \"It seems to me that there are two things you can do when listening to any new work. The most important thing is to lend yourself—or to put it another way—try to be as sensitive as you can to the overall feeling the new piece gives off. The second way is to listen with some awareness of the general shape of the new piece, realizing that a composer works with his musical materials just as an architect works with his building materials in order to construct an edifice that makes sense.\" He then discussed the work briefly but in some detail.\n\nTo Copland's surprise, his lecture was taken as an apologia, not an explanation, by the majority of the television audience. Moreover, vehement letters poured into NBC after the broadcast from across the United States. One read, \"If last night is any criterion of what can be expected in Lincoln Center, it should be called 'Center of Jungle Culture.'\" Another read, \"Dear Mr. Copland, Shame Shame Shame!\"\n\nBernstein conducted \"Connotations\" again during the first week of regular Philharmonic concerts in 1963 and included it among the pieces the orchestra played on its European tour that February. Despite the composer's claim in \"Copland Since 1943\" that \"The European premiere was more successful than the New York reception,\" reviews about \"Connotations\" remained mainly negative; comments abounded about \"mere din\" and \"dodecaphonic deserts.\" When the London audience gave the work a lengthy ovation, Bernstein responded that he would conduct another Copland work as an encore. When cries of \"Oh, oh\" ensued, he added, \"But this will be in a different style.\" He then conducted \"Hoe-Down\" from the ballet \"Rodeo\".\n\nA release of the New York performance by Columbia Records fared no better. Robert Marsh found the music \"dreary\" and \"dull.\" Irving Kolodin called it \"rather relentlessly grim.\" Everett Helm, who had been able to hear the work live before he sampled the recording, wrote, \"\"Connotations\" for Orchestra sounded rather strident on September 23; on the disc it becomes ear-piercing.\" Bernstein rerecorded \"Connotations\" with the New York Philharmonic for Columbia in 1973. This recording was released with Copland's \"Inscape\" and Carter's \"Concerto for Orchestra\".\n\nThe composer admitted that \"Connotations\" possessed \"a rather severe and somewhat intellectual tone.\" However, while he did not expect it to be an immediate success, he had still hoped that the music's intensity and drama might lend it some appeal. While Copland maintained that \"It bothers me not at all to realize that my range as a composer includes both accessible and problematic works,\" composer and musicologist Peter Dickinson notes \"a tone of defensiveness\" in this remark. Nevertheless, \"Connotations\"' abrasiveness to many listeners might not have been the only factor in its initial failure.\n\nThe negative initial reaction to \"Connotations\" has also been claimed to have been due to Bernstein's conducting. Bernstein was especially antipathetic toward works that were atonal or rhythmically disjunctive and \"could not overcome a deep-seated antipathy, an almost gut reaction\" against them.Of the contemporary composers with whom he could relate, he had been \"generous and enthusiastic\" in his support of Copland. His frequent programming of Copland's works during his tenure with the New York Philharmonic might, Adams suggests, have been partly in reaction against works of the twelve-tone school. Now he was confronted with what American composer John Adams terms a \"stridently dissonant, piss-n-vinegar\" work \"written in an idiom so alien to his own sensibilities,\" the first performance of which he would not only conduct but would also be televised to a national audience. Pollack claims Bernstein might have found \"Connotations \" \"boring\" and kept it on the program solely out of duty to his old friend.\n\nDespite Bernstein's own musical antipathies, Adams claims the conductor generally remained open-minded and curious enough \"to try something at least once.\" Among the world premieres of \"difficult\" works he led were Olivier Messiaen's \"Turangalîla-Symphonie\" in Boston in 1949 and Carter's \"Concerto for Orchestra\" in New York in 1970; and despite his apparent lack of identification with Carter's music, he described the composer in 1975 as \"a brilliant mind and a supremely intelligent musician.\" Bernstein conducted \"Connotations\" again during the first week of regular Philharmonic concerts in 1963 and included it among the pieces the orchestra played on its European tour in February 1963. He would also commission a subsequent orchestral work from Copland, which became \"Inscape\", and conduct \"Connotations\" again in an all-Copland concert with the New York Philharmonic in 1989. Even with this advocacy and the chance to familiarize himself at length, \"Connotations\" apparently remained a work that Bernstein did not conduct well. Critic Peter Davis, in his review of the 1989 performance, writes that while \"Connotations\" remained \"admittedly not a very lovable piece,\" in Bernstein's hands it \"sounded more fulsome than portentous.\"\n\nCopland acknowledged that the acoustics at the premiere were \"shrill.\" While Philharmonic Hall was being renovated in 1976 in an attempt to improve its sound, Harold C. Schonberg wrote, \"For all we know, \"Connotations\" is a masterpiece. But one thing is certain—it did not make many friends for Lincoln Center in 1962.\" While admitting the work was \"written in Copland's austere, objective, abstract style,\" he suggested that bad acoustics might have also played a part in the work's failure at the premiere. The orchestra that night had been augmented by a large chorus to perform the first movement of Gustav Mahler's Eighth Symphony, which pushed the orchestra forward, \"out of its normal playing position ... The sound was bad, bad. The bass response was sorely deficient, the hall was plagued with echoes, the musicians on stage reported that they could not hear each other very well (just great for ensemble) and in general Philharmonic Hall sounded like a cheap hi-fi set with the bass speakers out of the circuit.\n\nCopland conducted \"Connotations\" in 1966, 1967 and 1968 around the United States. This included an engagement at the Musica Viva series in San Francisco and concerts with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington D.C. and the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra. \"I spoke to the audiences,\" Copland writes, \"with humorous accounts of the work's adverse effect on droves of letter writers, who had heard the original performance, in person or on TV. Then I asked the brass section to illustrate the opening chords, and the strings how they sounded. Before they knew it, the audience was sympathetic. My purpose was not to sell the work but to demonstrate it.\"\n\nA decade after Bernstein premiered the work, Pierre Boulez, who had succeeded Bernstein as music director of the New York Philharmonic in 1971, conducted \"Connotations\" with the orchestra for the ten-year anniversary of Philharmonic Hall (subsequently renamed Avery Fisher Hall; later David Geffen Hall). According to Copland, ten years had allowed enough time to change audience perceptions for the better. In his review for \"The New York Times\" Harold C. Schonberg wrote that this time, the audience \"did not rise in revolt\" as it had in 1962. He added, \"The composer's cause was helped by, if memory serves, a better performance than had been given in 1962. Mr. Boulez revels in this kind of music, and he brought drama to it as well as a synthesizing quality.\"\n\n\"Connotations\" was the first orchestral work in which Copland used serial principles of composition. Serial or twelve-tone music, Copland stated, carried \"a built-in tenseness ... a certain drama ... a sense of strain or tension\" inherent in its extended use of chromaticism. \"These are new tensions,\" he continued, \"different from what I would have dreamt up if I had been thinking tonally.\" To composer John Adams, Copland's embrace of serial technique was not really such a stretch \"because ever since the 1920s, he'd already a piss-'n-vinegar penchant for sour intervals, like he did in the \"Piano Variations\".\" Contrary to the charge that would be made after \"Connotations\"' premiere that Copland wrote a twelve-tone work to impress younger composers, he had actually begun using the method at a time when few other American composers were doing so. While Copland's first expressly serial works were his Piano Quartet of 1950 and \"Piano Fantasy\" and he noted that some critics (whom he did not name) had traced a similarity in those pieces to his \"Piano Variations\" of 1930, he claimed in his 1967 \"conversation\" with Edward T. Cone that the \"Variations\" were \"the start of my interest in serial writing ... Although it doesn't use all twelve tones, it does use seven of them in what I hope is a consistently logical way.\" Prior to that interview, few had related Copland's early work to that of the founder of twelve-tone composition, Arnold Schoenberg.\nBy the time he wrote \"Connotations\", Copland had come to the view that serial composition was \"like looking at a picture from a different point of view\" and used it \"with the hope that it would freshen and enrich my [compositional] technique.\" Part of that changed viewpoint, Copland said, \"was that I began to hear chords that I wouldn't have heard otherwise. Heretofore, I had been thinking tonally, but this was a new way of moving tones about.\" Serialism also allowed Copland a synthesis of serial and non-serial practices that had long concerned Copland and he had previously felt impossible to attain. One challenge Copland said he faced while he composed \"Connotations\" was \"to construct an overall line that had continuity, dramatic force and an inherent unity.\" He stated that he had faced a similar challenge in his \"Orchestral Variations\" (his orchestration of the \"Piano Variations\"). He added that while dodecaphonic techniques supplied \"the building blocks\" for \"Connotations\", it was up to him to supply \"the edifice\" that these blocks would eventually form.\n\nCritic Paul Henry Lang, among others, lamented Copland's \"yield to the conformism of 12-tone music.\" As serial and serial-inspired music was considered more academically viable than music utilizing common practice tonality (especially in Europe), some contemporary critics felt that Copland was trying to retain his place at the apex of the American classical music scene by conforming to \"academic standards.\" Taruskin suggests that it might have appeared to these critics that Copland \"had sacrificed his hard-won, well-nigh unique public appeal for what seemed ... an 'alienated' modernist stance.\" As the composer had been one of the first American composers to import the style from Europe—in the mid twenties—these critics may have overlooked the possibility that his \"populist period\" may have represented the more jarring deviation in his compositional style.\n\nIt had also been some time since a Copland piece had been appreciated widely by audiences. His opera \"The Tender Land\" had not fared well, either in its original or revised forms. Choreographer Jerome Robbins never produced Copland's ballet \"Dance Panels\", despite the fact that he had commissioned it. None of his major orchestral works from the 1960s—\"Connotations\", \"Music for a Great City\", \"Emblems\" and \"Inscape\"—made much of an impact with audiences. Nor do they fit in either the populist or modernist parts of Copland's compositional output. Copland was aware that dodecaphonism did not hold as high a place as it had previously and writes, \"By the sixties, serialism had been around for over fifty years; young composers were not so fascinated with it anymore.\" Nonetheless, he did not want to be pigeonholed. He told American composer Walter Piston in 1963, \"People always want to shove me into the American idea more than I really want. Nobody wants to be an 'American' composer now as they did.\" He told another friend, \"Young composers today wouldn't be caught dead with a folk tune!\" He heard a considerable amount of new music through his association with Tanglewood and might not have wanted to be left behind. At the same time, he might not have become totally at home with serialism. He confided to Verna Fine, \"I don't feel comfortable with the twelve-tone system, but I don't want to keep repeating myself.\"\n\nChoreographer John Neumier, noted for his ballets based on literary themes, received permission from Copland to use music from \"Connotations\", the \"Piano Variations\" and \"Piano Fantasy\" for a ballet, \"The Fall Hamlet (The Hamlet Affair).\" Staged by the American Ballet Theatre on January 6, 1976, the title role was danced by Mikhail Barishnikov, Ophelia by Gelsie Kirkland, Gertrude by Marcia Haydée and Claudius by Erik Bruhn. The ballet was received poorly, due to ineffective choreography. Critic Bob Micklin noted, however, that Copland's \"prickly, restless music\" reflected the ballet's story very well.\n\nDespite its initial reception, \"Connotations\" was listed in 1979 by \"Billboard\" magazine among Copland works that continued to be programmed by orchestras, with subsequent performances by Pierre Boulez, Edo de Waart and Sixten Ehrling received positively. Reaction to the work itself remains mixed. Ross dismisses \"Connotations\" as a \"barbaric yawp of a piece.\" Morin calls it a \"thorny, riveting patchwork\" and listening to it \"like the unrelenting pummeling of a prizefighter at times.\" Adams calls its style \"very simplistic ... strident\" and \"generally unpleasant sounding\" and adds that \"the rigor [of twelve-tone composition] seemed more to cramp [Copland's] natural spontaneity than to aid it.\" Composer Kyle Gann calls \"Connotations\" \"big, unwieldy ... and [not] that good ... Copland's imagination seemed constrained by the technique. On a more positive note, Davis wrote after a performance of the work under Ehrling by The Juilliard Orchestra that while \"Connotations\" remains a \"spiky\" composition, Copland \"adopts Schoenberg's serial procedures to produce a sequence of typically pungent and exhilarating Coplandesque sonorities.\" Desmond Shawe-Taylor called the work \"beautifully put together: full of energy, variety, thought\" after he had heard Boulez conduct the piece. Michael Andrews wrote of Copland's \"mammoth, anxious and angry vision\" and Barlett Naylor of \"a majesty hidden in this dark piece\" after both had heard de Waart's performance.\n\nAlong with Bernstein's two performances, Copland recorded \"Connotations\" with the Orchestre National de France (no longer available). More recently, The Juilliard Orchestra recorded the work under the direction of Sixten Ehrling for New World Records.\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

Among the dead was the cousin of comedian Denis Leary, Firefighter Jerry Lucey, and his close childhood friend, Lt. Tommy Spencer. In response, the comedian founded the Leary Firefighters Foundation, which has since distributed over $2.5 million (USD) to fire departments in the Worcester, Boston, and New York City areas for equipment, training materials, and new vehicles and facilities, since its creation in 2000. As of 2006, the LFF has donated $425,000 to the Boston Fire Department, including a fireboat.\n\nAs the foundation's president, Leary has been active in all of the fundraising, and usually presents large checks and donated equipment personally. The close relationship he has developed with the FDNY, as well as individual firefighters across the New York/New England area, has resulted in Leary's most recent television show, \"Rescue Me\", a drama-comedy on FX about firefighters. In the pilot episode of the show, he is seen wearing a Leary Firefighter Foundation 9-11 memorial T-shirt.\n\nA separate fund run by Leary's foundation, the Fund for New York's Bravest, has distributed over $2 million (USD) to the families of the 343 firemen killed in the September 11, 2001 attacks, as well as provided funding for necessities such as a new mobile command center, first responder training, and a high-rise simulator for the New York City Fire Department's training campus.\n\nAfter Leary learned that the New Orleans Fire Department members rescued 18,000 people from Katrina waters using NOFD members' personal boats, the Leary Foundation committed money to help purchase rescue boats for the NOFD. Of the 33 firehouses in New Orleans before the hurricane, at least 20 were so damaged by the disaster that they were unusable—yet firefighters stayed on the job—even when they had to sleep in their rigs, because their own homes were also damaged. The Leary Foundation is committing more money and resources to further address some of the myriad needs of the NOFD and the people they serve.\n"}

The event, held at the Russian Army Theatre in Moscow, included the soldiers walking down the catwalk in uniform and singing songs while accompanied by guitarists (a memorable lyric included the phrases, \"Since we're soldiers, our first concern is automatic weapons; boys come second\"). A children's choir sang a song called \"Our Army Is the Strongest\". Other events, shown on film, saw the contestants competing in drills, crawling in combat uniform, entering tanks, and running with automatic weapons.

The show, which mixed celebrity interviews, chatty everyday observations, scripted sketches, and phone conversations with viewers (often canned), premiered on August 8, 2005 in the 11:30 p.m. time slot on Comedy Central. The show struggled to find an audience, averaging fewer than 700,000 viewers, a poor performance that Carolla jokingly acknowledged on air. On September 20, the show was moved to 12:00 and the live audience was dropped. The show got its highest ratings when Steve-O of \"Jackass\" and \"Wildboyz\" fame came onto the show intoxicated and tackled Adam while yelling obscenities. The last episode aired in November 2005.\n\nWhen Carolla takes calls from the home audience, this title card is shown on the monitor and the announcer stops the show to ask \"\"Who's on the Blower?\"\" sometimes to Carolla's impatience. When Carlos Mencia was the guest, the segment was retitled \"\"¿Quién está en el Teléfono?\"\"\n\nCarolla walks in the woods with a guy who looks somewhat like Benjamin Franklin, and plays straight man as the \"1780s guy\" questions current phenomena such as metrosexuals (\"We call them homosexuals\") and Oprah Winfrey (\"Nubian sorceress\").\n\nCarolla explains his theory that all extremely strange news stories happen either in Germany or Florida, and challenges himself and his guest to guess in which of these places a given news story occurred. Andy Milonakis played a special version of this game, Super Germany or Florida? This bit originated as an idea for \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", and when the writers vetoed it, Carolla took it to \"Loveline\". Callers would often call in with a bizarre news story and Carolla and Dr. Drew would attempt to guess whether it was from Germany or Florida. The game also appeared during Carolla's guest host stint on \"The Late Late Show\" and subsequently to \"Too Late\".\n\nIn some early episodes, Carolla got so carried away with his rants that he forgot to take any phone calls from home viewers, and so the show's producers invented this segment in which Carolla attempts to answer 10 calls in three minutes.\n\nCarolla originally developed \"The Lightning Round\" on \"Loveline\" when, after the last commercial break in the show, he would take as many phone calls as possible as his alter ego Ace Rockolla, giving quick answers to each caller, regardless of their question. It used the frequent sound effects of a thunder clap and a cow bell, along with Carolla's insistence of repeating the time (\"It's 11:56 and 38 seconds, three minutes and 22 seconds before the top of the hour!\") and temperature (\"86 in LA, 84 in Culver City, 88 in Monterey Park, 83 in Whittier and 79 in Gardena!\").\n\nIn another game that is \"sweeping the nation\", Adam and guests attempt to predict whether or not Ray Oldhafer, Adam's childhood friend who appeared on \"The Adam Carolla Project\", can break certain objects.\n\nA buffer segment in between commercial breaks that is a tape of a message left by listeners who are \"drunk, high, pissed off, crazy and/or have a great accent\" This segment seemed to have been picked up by \"The Adam Carolla Show\" on the radio.\n\n"}

It is not entirely clear, however, for which Kennedy he named the channel. Kane may have had his fellow explorer William Kennedy in mind, whom he had met a few years previously while both were involved in earlier searches for Franklin's expedition. However, most historians believe it was named for John Pendleton Kennedy, the United States Secretary of the Navy during 1852 to 1853, under whose direction Kane's second Arctic voyage took place.\n\nIt forms part of Nares Strait, linking Kane Basin with Hall Basin. From the south, its beginning is marked by Capes Lawrence and Jackson; its junction with Hall Basin is marked by Capes Baird and Morton. It is about 130 kilometres in length, between 24 and 32 kilometres in width and averages water depths between 180 and 340 metres.\n\nIt contains Hans Island, which is claimed by both Canada and Denmark, because it is located close to the middle between the two coastlines, but about 1000 meters closer to Greenland's coast. The channel also contains two more islands, Franklin Island and Crozier Island which are located much closer to the Greenland coast and therefore belong to Greenland. Hannah Island is located at the mouth of the Bessel Fjord, northeast of Cape Bryan.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2320489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320489", "title": "Lincoln Sea", "text": "Lincoln Sea\n\nLincoln Sea (; ) is a body of water in the Arctic Ocean, stretching from Cape Columbia, Canada, in the west to Cape Morris Jesup, Greenland, in the east. The northern limit is defined as the great circle line between those two headlands. It is covered with sea ice throughout the year, the thickest sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, which can be up to thick. Water depths range from to . Water and ice from Lincoln Sea empty into Robeson Channel, the northernmost part of Nares Strait, most of the time.\n\nThe sea was named after Robert Todd Lincoln, then United States Secretary of War, on Adolphus W. Greely's 1881–1884 Arctic expedition into Lady Franklin Bay.\n\nAlert, the northernmost station of Canada, is the only populated place on the shore of Lincoln Sea.\n\nThe body of water to the east of Lincoln Sea (east of Cape Morris Jesup) is the Wandel Sea.\n\nBecause of the severe ice conditions that last year-round, oceanographic measurements of the Lincoln Sea have been all but impossible. Before the 1980s, only low-flying aircraft samplings and ground observations from ice islands could be attempted; these did not stray far from the shores of Greenland and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago due to the harsh environment. Between 1989 and 1994, the field experiments in Project Spinnaker were underway, implementing instrumentation that captured temperature and salinity profiles well into the heart of the Lincoln Sea. Taken just east of where the North American continent intersects the Lomonosov Ridge, these observations revealed the oceanographic features and current formations within and surrounding the Lincoln Sea.\n\nAlong the continental margins of the Arctic Ocean basin, narrow boundary currents are hypothesized to house intense large-scale advection that is critical in the general circulation of Arctic waters. From the Bering Strait, Pacific Ocean waters flow counterclockwise (cyclonically) along the northern shores of Canada, passing through the Lincoln Sea. Atlantic Ocean waters cyclonically flow in from and return to the Eurasian basin along the Greenland Sea continental slope. The waters of these basins converge at the Lincoln Sea, creating unique vertical temperature and salinity profiles here. Measurements detail that both the Pacific and Eurasian Ocean water profiles are clearly offset from one another, an important facet of the hydrography of the Lincoln Sea.\n\nThe Lincoln Sea has been found to contain water with three distinct properties. The first concerns the water in the inner part of the Lincoln Sea shelf, where the temperature and salinity profiles increase from the surface to the seafloor. The second involves the water covering the outer part of the shelf, including the slope; the waters here hold attributes similar to those in the Canadian basin and thus not unlike those from the Pacific. The third includes the waters north of the shelf’s slope. These waters protrude into the Arctic basin’s large-scale circulation, and so their characteristics appear to change over to those found in the Eurasian basin.\n\nAlong the continental margins of the Arctic Ocean basin, narrow boundary currents are hypothesized to house intense large-scale advection that is critical in the general circulation of Arctic waters. One of these boundary currents resides along the sloping edge of the Lincoln Sea shelf, between the base and the shelf break at approximately 1600 m. The current’s strength is 5–6 cm/s, according to long-term measurements. Assuming an undercurrent with an average strength of 4 cm/s and dimensions of 50 km in length and 1000 m in depth, the transport delivered over the slope of the Lincoln Sea shelf would be 2 Sverdrups, where 1 Sverdrup equals 10^6 m^3/s. Measurements reveal that this undercurrent shares comparable features to that found in the Beaufort Sea, whose boundary currents are responsible for large-scale advection within the Arctic circulation. Because of this mutual oceanographic behavior, it has been determined that the Lincoln Sea undercurrent continuously flows and is a component of the boundary current system that spans between Alaska and Greenland along the northern shores of the Canadian archipelago.\n\nIn May 2004 and 2005, electromagnetic measurements from helicopters revealed insights into the thickness of the sea ice in the Lincoln Sea and surrounding waters. With thicknesses ranging between 3.9 and 4.2 m, multi-year ice dominates south of 84°N. First-year ice, with thicknesses ranging between 0.9 and 2.2 m, denotes the refreezing of the Lincoln Polynya ice. These helicopter measurements concur with satellite-based radar imagery as well as ground-based electromagnetic observations. Drifting buoys have exposed a southward drift of sea ice toward Ellesmere Island and Nares Strait. It has been concluded that shear in the Lincoln Sea narrow boundary current plays an important role in shifting and thus removing sea ice from the Arctic region.\n\nThe majority of sea ice export takes place on the eastern edges of the Arctic Ocean circulation near Greenland through the Fram Strait. Sea ice export through the Canadian archipelago was originally assumed to be zero, but that is not the case. The Lincoln Sea contains very thick multi-year sea ice, and so was thought to be stationary because of the apparent lack of oceanic outlets. However, according to a Canadian sea ice study, an area of approximately 22500 km of multi-year sea ice is drained through the Nares Strait each year. During the Northern Hemisphere winter, an area of about 225 km of ice reforms, resulting in 335 km of total sea ice drainage. Although this represents only one of the many pathways from the Arctic Ocean basin through the Canadian archipelago, \"…this [total drainage] is an order of magnitude less than the flux of sea ice out of [the] Fram Strait.\"\n\nA disagreement over a 200-square-kilometre section of the Lincoln Sea emerged after 1973 when Canada and Denmark signed a treaty establishing the offshore boundary north of Canada's Ellesmere Island and Danish-controlled Greenland but left portions of it undefined.\n\nFrom Canada's point of view, the point of focus in the Lincoln Sea dispute has been Denmark's inclusion of Beaumont Island (Greenland) (not to be confused with Beaumont Island off the west coast of Graham Land, Antarctica) off Greenland's northwest coast in calculating the boundary. The boundary is determined in that region by an \"equidistance\" principle that draws the line halfway between points along each country's coastline. Canada has basically argued that Beaumont Island is too insignificant to be used by Greenland to help determine the international boundary.\n\nThis issue however has remained a low-profile irritant in Canadian-Danish relations.\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Lincoln Sea as follows:\n\n\"On the North.\" Cape Columbia to Cape Morris Jesup (Greenland).\n\n\"On the South.\" Cape Columbia through Northeastern shore of Ellesmere Island to Cape Sheridan to Cape Bryant (Greenland) through Greenland to Cape Morris Jesup.\n"}

The promotion initially established as Wrestle and Romance in 1992, had very few regular contracted workers, instead most of the workers were either freelance or employed in other promotions. Because of this WAR ran many all-star cards. It had inter-promotional feuds against New Japan Pro Wrestling, Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, the new Tokyo Pro Wrestling, and UWF International. WAR also continued, albeit in a loose fashion, SWS's old working agreement with the World Wrestling Federation, when they backed the WWF's first Japanese tour, in 1994.\n\nOn July 28, 1995, WAR was renamed \"Wrestle Association R\" at a show held in the Korakuen Hall. In 1998, WAR cancelled contracts to the roster and began running less and less cards due to Tenryu's comeback in New Japan, and in July 2000, it promoted a farewell show that served as the prelude to Tenryu's return to All Japan Pro Wrestling (many wrestlers from WAR also joined AJPW to fill the void by those who joined Mitsuharu Misawa in forming Pro Wrestling Noah). The WAR name was kept for the use of a stable led by Tenryu during brief angles in All Japan and FMW in 2001.\n\nOn July 27, 2006, WAR staged a reunion show at Tokyo Korakuen Hall. The show was supported by various Japanese wrestling promotions including New Japan, All Japan Pro Wrestling and Dragon Gate. This was also the final card promoted under the WAR banner.\n\nWAR was the first promotion to create a steady junior heavyweight tag team title long before New Japan Pro Wrestling, WCW, and Pro Wrestling Noah hit upon the idea.\n\nIn 2010, the Tenryu Project was organised, and is somewhat of a successor to WAR.\n\nThis title used the championship belt originally used in the 1950s by the old Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance for their JWA Japanese Heavyweight Championship, held throughout its existence by Rikidōzan.\nThese are not exhaustive lists. Guest Japanese wrestlers from other promotions, such as Nobuhiko Takada from UWF International and The Great Sasuke from Michinoku Pro Wrestling, are not listed.\nAn inter-promotional show between WAR and the World Wrestling Federation was held on September 15, 1992 at the Yokohama Arena in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.\n\nWAR Anniversary Show was the flagship event of WAR which was used to celebrate the anniversary of the promotion. The event was held between 1993 and 2000, when the promotion was discontinued.\n\nAn inter-promotional event featuring talent from WAR and Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling was held on November 28, 1993 at the Sumo Hall in Tokyo, Japan.\nRevolution was a special event held on December 15, 1993 at the Sumo Hall in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nRevolution Rumble '94 In Ryogoku Kokugikan was a special event held on March 2, 1994 at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo, Japan. The event was notable for an inter-promotional tag team main event match in which Genichiro Tenryu and Ashura Hara represented WAR against Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling's Atsushi Onita and Tarzan Goto. Onita pinned Tenryu and the match set up a major main event between Tenryu and Onita for FMW's 5th Anniversary Show at the Kawasaki Stadium on May 5, 1994.\n\nSuper J-Cup is a professional wrestling tournament featuring junior heavyweight wrestlers from all over the world. The tournament was originally conceived by Japanese wrestler Jushin Thunder Liger as a showcase for junior heavyweights from promotions from Asia and North America on a national level. WAR hosted the second edition of the tournament on December 13, 1995, at the Sumo Hall in Tokyo, Japan.\nAn inter-promotional event featuring wrestlers from WAR and UWFI, among other promotions as well. The event took place a day after the 4th Anniversary Show on July 21, 1996 at the Sumo Hall in Tokyo, Japan.\nFinal - Reborn to Future was a reunion event of WAR after the promotion had closed down in 2000 and marked the final event ever in WAR history. The event took place on July 27, 2006 at the Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, Japan. The event aired via tape delay on Gaora TV on August 17. The event featured a title defense of the WAR International Junior Heavyweight Championship which had been in possession of Masaaki Mochizuki since WAR closed in 2000 and the main event was an eight-man tag team match, in which WAR wrestlers took on Heisei Ishingun.\n\n\n"}

Organizations such as the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have set guidelines for noise level decibel limits for rapid transit.\n\n\nDiesel-electric locomotives have various sounds associated with them, although in more recent years newer locomotives have become much quieter due to Federally-mandated noise regulations. However, there are still times that a locomotive may develop a defect in its turbocharger, which produces a whine that can be heard for many miles. While this is rare, and usually the said locomotive gets put into the shop quickly, the noise has been compared to an air raid siren, a UFO, or just a very large leaf blower. It appears to be the most common on EMD units equipped with the 710 prime mover, although any turbocharged locomotive may develop this problem.\n\n\n__notoc__\n"}

{"id": "2320508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320508", "title": "DC: The New Frontier", "text": "DC: The New Frontier\n\nDC: The New Frontier is an Eisner, Harvey and Shuster Award-winning six-issue comic book limited series written and drawn by Darwyn Cooke, and published by DC Comics in 2004. The series was collected into two trade paperback volumes in 2004 and 2005, an Absolute Edition in 2006 and a deluxe edition in 2015. The story was adapted into an animated film, \"\", which was released on February 26, 2008.\n\nThe series was influenced by \"Kingdom Come\", \"The Golden Age\", \"Watchmen\" and \"The Dark Knight Returns\". Much like \"The Golden Age\", \"New Frontier\" is set primarily in the 1950s and depicts Golden Age superheroes Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman meeting Silver Age characters The Flash, Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter. The story bridges the gap between the end of the Golden Age and the beginning of the Silver Age in the DC Universe.\n\n\"The New Frontier\" is set between 1945 and 1960, tracing the decline of the so-called Golden Age and the beginning of the Silver Age of comic books. Golden Age characters such as Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman meet Silver Age characters, such as Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern and The Flash. Cameo appearances by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Vice President Richard Nixon and references to the Korean War, atomic testing, the civil rights movement and the Soviet Union provide historical context. The storyline is inspired by comic books and films of the period, including the novel and film versions of Tom Wolfe's \"The Right Stuff\". The series attempts to re-imagine and pay homage to the era of culture and political turmoil which ushered in the presidency of John F. Kennedy. The title of the comic evokes the Kennedy's iconic \"New Frontier\" speech.\n\nThe story begins in 1945. A military unit known as The Losers – made up of Captain William Storm, Johnny Cloud, Sarge Clay, Gunner Mackey and the unit's dog \"Pooch\" – is sent to a remote island in The Pacific to retrieve Richard Flagg and the ex-Nazi scientist his unit was transporting. As The Losers are approaching the island, their boat is capsized by a mysterious tidal wave, and they are attacked by an enormous tyrannosaurus rex. Though the t-rex is heavily injured, it survives the heavy bombardment, losing only an arm, and killing Mackey before its retreat. The remaining Losers hole up in a fortified cave. The following day, Sarge - grief-stricken by Mackey's death - ventures out alone to kill the t-rex, while Storm and Cloud go in search of Flagg and his men. Storm is carried off by a pterodactyl, leaving Cloud to return to the cave, where he discovers Pooch and Flagg, who informs him that Sarge has been killed. Cloud helps Flagg to escape the island, but stays behind with Pooch to finish off the T-Rex that killed his comrades, writing an account of the mission in charcoal on the cave walls. The following morning, Pooch is killed and Cloud is heavily injured by a booby trap set by Flagg. Accepting his fate, Cloud attracts the attention of the t-rex and jumps into its mouth, armed with two live hand grenades.\n\nFollowing the end of the Second World War, the world has entered the Atomic Era, and the Cold War has commenced. Superheroes' inability to intervene in World War II, due to Adolf Hitler's command of The Spear of Destiny, coupled with strong anti-Communist sentiments perpetuated by Joseph McCarthy, has led to a vast condemnation of masked vigilantism. In the face of colossal public outcry, the Justice Society of America have disbanded, and the vast majority of costumed heroes have either retired or been arrested, while magical and godlike figures such as The Spectre, Doctor Fate and Captain Marvel have left the planet. Only government-sanctioned superheroes, Superman and Wonder Woman, and a small handful of vigilantes able to evade arrest, including Batman and Hourman (who is chased off a rooftop at the beginning of the comic by armed police), remain active.\n\nIn the first hours of armistice immediately following the Korean War, fighter pilots Hal Jordan and Kyle \"Ace\" Morgan are shot down by Korean planes. Ace saves Jordan, who lands in North Korean territory, where he is saved by reporters Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen, but not before Jordan is forced to kill a North Korean soldier who is apparently unaware that the conflict is over. Jordan, who has a strict moral and ethical opposition to murder, chastises himself for not remembering the Korean words that would have potentially saved the man's life. Meanwhile, in the early years of the Vietnam War, Superman meets with Wonder Woman, who has just rescued a village of women kept in slavery by the Viet Cong. Superman criticises Wonder Woman for allowing the women to slaughter their captors, thereby defying international law, and threatens to report her for her actions. Angered, Wonder Woman shows him the door.\n\nIn 1955, the last surviving member of a Martian race, J'onn J'onzz, arrives on Earth in Gotham City in response to an astronomer's signal. The shock of J'onzz's arrival causes the astronomer to suffer a fatal heart attack, but not before warning J'onzz of humanity's capacity for violence and distrust. Taking note, J'onzz – capable of shape-shifting – assumes the astronomer's identity and later creates the identity of GCPD Detective John Jones, based on what he has learned of human nature through television. He declares that he wishes to be one of the \"good guys\". In 1956, police scientist Barry Allen is struck by lightning, giving him superhuman speed. In 1957, J'onzz (now using his John Jones persona) intercepts a struggle between Batman and a group of cultists who worship something referred to by their leader as \"the Centre\", as they attempt to sacrifice the son of a wealthy Gotham magnate. J'onzz is briefly incapacitated by his crippling fear of fire, but Batman is able to save the child, brutally assaulting the cult leader. The leader chuckles to himself that they will all be judged.\n\nTed \"Wildcat\" Grant fights Cassius Clay in the World Heavyweight Championship in Las Vegas, attended by Jordan, Ace, Bruce Wayne, Selina Kyle, Oliver Queen, Lane, Flagg, Carol Ferris, Iris West and several former JSA members. Clay initially staggers Grant, who is saved from a knockout only by the bell, but Grant is eventually able to win the match and is declared Heavyweight Champion of the World. The celebration of Grant's victory is short-lived, however, as Captain Cold arrives to rob the casino where the party is being held. Iris, who is calling Barry Allen at the moment of the attack, is injured. Allen, as The Flash, runs from Central City to Vegas, disarming Captain Cold's cold-fusion devices and incapacitating him with his own weapon. Jordan and Morgan drive to a nearby military base, where Ace shows Jordan a plane he is going to fly from Vegas to New York as part of a new television program. He tells Jordan about a job interview that he has arranged for him with Carol Ferris and her father, the owner of a large aircraft company who flew with Jordan's father during World War II, before leaving for New York. Jordan accepts the position offered by Carol, and the two begin a relationship. \n\nIn Montreal, 1957, Matthew Ryan, the survivor of a devastating plane crash, wakes up from a recurring nightmare of the crash and leaves the amusement park where he is working. He returns to the crash site to try and overcome his trauma and encounters the fellow survivors, Morgan, Leslie \"Rocky\" Davis and Walter Mark \"Prof\" Haley. They each express surprise that they were all compelled to return to the crash site on the same night, and question why they all survived. They resolve to reunite as the Challengers of the Unknown. In Knoxville, a black man named John Wilson is lynched by the Ku Klux Klan while his wife and daughter are burned inside his house. Wilson survives and decides to take revenge on the Klansmen. He takes the name \"John Henry\" and forges two sledgehammers to wield as weapons. \n\nIn New York, Flagg and the fellow members of Task Force X, Karin Grace, Jess Bright and Dr. Hugh Evans, fend off an attack from another giant pterodactyl; revealed to be one of many attacks that America has been facing along the East and West coasts. Evans is snatched by the pterodactyl, and the two perish above the Statue of Liberty after the creature chews through a round of thermite in Evans' belt. Flagg recognises that the pterodactyl came from the same island he was stranded on with The Losers, and the government sends Task Force X, along with Ace, Ryan, Rocky and Prof to investigate and begin containing any potential threats. Task Grace begins to sense a colossal presence, eventually overcome by its enormity, suffering a brief seizure. Flagg returns to the cave and discovers Cloud's entire message: he predicted that Flagg would eventually return and finished the message warning of a vast spirit with no apparent beginning or end, described as \"an all-consuming circle\", proclaiming that the island is \"a living thing\". Suddenly, Flagg's party are attacked by a mutated dinosaur, forcing them to flee the island. Just as it emerged, the dinosaur is seemingly swallowed up by the ground.\n\nWith Ferris' company, Jordan is subjected to a gruelling series of tests in the hopes that these will help him qualify as an astronaut. Eventually, he is selected by Carol and Flagg, also working with Ferris, to take part in their top-secret space program. Meanwhile, in Tennessee, a hooded John Henry – wearing the severed noose he was hanged with – murders several Klansmen who have just murdered a black congregation and burned their church.\n\n\"New Frontier\" includes elements of the Golden and Silver Ages which did not appear until the 1970s. Many characters appeared as they did when they were created, and were not retconned to fit the era and story. Barry Allen becomes the Flash in 1956 (the year of his first appearance in the comics) and Hal Jordan acquires the power ring and becomes Green Lantern in 1959, the same year that story was published.\n\nAlthough Cooke said that \"New Frontier\" took place in the pre-\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" continuity, he did not use the period-accurate Earth-One and Earth-Two Multiverse concepts; he used a post-\"Crisis\" continuity variant, where Golden and Silver Age heroes exist in a unified timeline rather than separate realities. The \"New Frontier\" universe was one of the 52 Earths in the DC multiverse (Earth-21).\n\n\"The New Frontier's\" style has several influences: Jack Kirby's squared fingers, muscles and jaws; the clean lines of Golden Age-era comics; the Fleischer Superman cartoons; \"\", and other shows in the DC animated universe; Cooke was an artist on many of the latter. His style resembles that of Bruce Timm.\n\nThe series received Eisner Awards for Best Limited Series, Best Coloring and Best Publication Design, Harvey Awards for Best Artist, Best Colorist and Best Continuing or Limited Series and received the Shuster Award for Outstanding Canadian Comic Book Cartoonist (Writer-Artist). In 2007, when the series was released as an Absolute Edition, it received an Eisner Award for Best Graphic Album (Reprint) and a Harvey Award for Best Graphic Album of Previously Published Work.\n\nIt was adapted as a direct-to-video animated film, written by Stan Berkowitz and produced by Bruce Timm with Darwyn Cooke a story and visual consultant. Rated PG-13, it was released in the United States on February 26, 2008 on DVD, HD DVD, Blu-ray and pay-per-view.\n\nAs of February 2019, the series has been collected in two softcover collections, an Absolute Edition, a deluxe edition, and a DC Black Label Edition:\n\nDC Direct first released a line of action figures based on the series in July 2006:\n\nA box set of Batman, Superman, Green Lantern and Wonder Woman (with a new head), including a reprint of \"Justice League: The New Frontier Special\", was released in April, 2009.\n\n\"Solo\" #5 (2005), written and drawn by Darwyn Cooke, included a short story (\"Triangulation: A New Frontier Thriller\") with King Faraday set in pre-revolutionary Cuba. \"Justice League: The New Frontier Special\" was released in May 2008 as a follow-up to the \"Justice League: The New Frontier\" DVD. Stories included Batman vs. Superman, a post-\"New Frontier\" story where Robin teams up with Kid Flash for the first time and a \"Mad Magazine\"-style story with Wonder Woman and Black Canary.\n\n"}

{"id": "2320524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320524", "title": "Black or White", "text": "Black or White\n\n\"Black or White\" is a single by American singer Michael Jackson. The song was released by Epic Records on November 11, 1991, as the first single from his eighth studio album, \"Dangerous\". He co-wrote, composed, and produced it with Bill Bottrell. The song is a fusion of pop rock, dance and hip hop. Epic Records described the song as \"a rock 'n' roll dance song about racial harmony\".\n\n\"Black or White\" peaked at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on December 7, 1991, making it the fastest chart topper since The Beatles' \"Get Back\". It stayed there for a total of seven weeks. Jackson became the first artist to have number one hits in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s with the song. It is certified 2x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Around the world, \"Black or White\" hit number one in 20 countries, including the US, the UK, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Turkey, Zimbabwe, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Eurochart Hot 100. It was the best-selling single worldwide of 1992.\n\nThe music video for \"Black or White\" premiered on MTV, BET, VH1, and Fox, which gave them their highest Nielsen ratings ever at the time, as well as the BBC's \"Top of the Pops\" in the UK on November 14, 1991. The video was directed by John Landis, who previously directed \"Thriller\". It was co-choreographed by Jackson and Vincent Paterson. It premiered simultaneously in 27 countries, with an audience of 500 million viewers, the most ever for a music video.\n\n\"Black or White\" was honored with the first and only \"Billboard\" No. 1 World Single. The music video of the song appears on the video albums: \"\" (long version), \"Video Greatest Hits – HIStory\" (long version, without graffiti on VHS version but with graffiti on DVD version), \"Number Ones\" (short version), and \"Michael Jackson's Vision\" (long version without graffiti). In 2003, \"Q\" magazine ranked \"Black or White\" at number 84 in their list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\".\n\n\"Black or White\" was written, composed and produced by Michael Jackson and Bill Bottrell, and was picked as the first single from the album \"Dangerous\". An alternate version was first heard by Sony executives on a plane trip to Neverland, as the third track of the promotional CD acetate. It began to be promoted on radio stations the first week of November 1991 in New York and Los Angeles. \"Black or White\" was officially released one week later, on November 5, 1991.\n\nThe song has elements of dance, hip hop and hard rock music such as Bill Bottrell's guitars and Jackson's vocal style. This song is played in the key of E major, with Jackson's vocal spanning from E3 to B4, and its tempo is measured at 115 BPM.\n\nThe song's main riff, played by Bill Bottrell, is often incorrectly attributed to Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash. Slash's guitar playing is actually heard in the skit that precedes the album version of the song and he did play the main riff during \"live\" performances of the song.\n\nTo prepare the audience for the special occasion of the televised premiere of the \"Black or White\" video, Epic records released the song (without the accompanying images) to radio stations just two days in advance. In a period of 24 hours, \"Black or White\", described by the record company as \"a rock 'n' roll dance song about racial harmony\", had been added to the playlists of 96 percent of 237 of the United States' Top 40 radio stations.\n\n\"Black or White\" entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 35. A week later it shot up to number three and in its third week, December 7, 1991, it ascended to number one, making it the fastest chart topper since The Beatles' \"Get Back\", which also won the Hot 100 in just three weeks in 1969 and also his twelfth number-one entry. It closed the year at number one, and remained at the top of the singles chart into 1992 for a total of seven weeks, making Michael Jackson the first artist to have number one popular hits in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. In the UK, the single became the first single by an American to go into the singles chart at number one since 1960, when \"It's Now or Never\" by Elvis Presley did in the same manner. Around the world, \"Black or White\" hit number one in 20 countries, including the US, the UK, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Turkey, Zimbabwe, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Eurochart Hot 100, number two in Germany and Austria and number three in the Netherlands. The single was certified platinum in the US, selling over one million copies and became the second best selling single of the year. As of August 2018 the song further certified two time platinum for the digital sales.\n\nReviews of the song were generally favorable. \"Billboard\" described the song as a \"surprisingly sparse, but instantly gratifying pop/rocker that reveals his grittiest and most affecting performance in years.\" They noted further that the guitar appearance by Slash and rap cameo by Bill Bottrell is \"purely incidental\". David Browne praised: \"He still knows how to fashion a hook that will take up permanent residence in your brain (away from its video, \"Black or White\" is spare and effortless)\" \"Rolling Stone\"s Allan Light in his \"Dangerous\" review, compares the song unfavourably to \"Beat It\": \"Neither this slow-burn solo nor the Stones-derived riff on 'Black or White' offers the catharsis of Eddie Van Halen's blazing break on 'Beat It'\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic highlighted the song. The Pazz & Jop critics' poll ranked \"Black or White\" at number 19.\n\nThe Clivillés & Cole remixes for \"Black or White\", released as a promotional single in 1992, also charted on many European countries. In the UK, it reached number 14, and in Ireland, number 11. The promotional single also surprisingly peaked at number 18 in Australia. Despite the favourable European response to this remix, it was never included on a Michael Jackson album or compilation, except on the third disc of the French & UK versions of Jackson's greatest hits album \"King of Pop\".\n\nThe music video for \"Black or White\" premiered on MTV, BET, VH1, and Fox (giving them their highest Nielsen ratings ever at the time) as well as the BBC's \"Top of the Pops\" in the UK on November 14, 1991. Along with Jackson, it featured Macaulay Culkin, Tess Harper, Tyra Banks, and George Wendt. The video was directed by John Landis, who previously directed \"Thriller\". The music video was filmed from late September to early October 1991. The dance scene with the Native Americans shown in the video was filmed at Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park in Agua Dulce, California. The scene where Michael Jackson and the dancer appear on the freeway was filmed at 11779 Sheldon Street in Sun Valley, Los Angeles.\n\nIt was co-choreographed by Jackson and Vincent Paterson. It premiered simultaneously in 27 countries, with an audience of 500 million viewers, the most ever for a music video.\n\nThe first few minutes of the video feature an extended version of the song's intro. During this interlude (sometimes similar to Marty Callner's 1984 \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" video for Twisted Sister) an 11-year-old boy (Macaulay Culkin) is dancing to rock music in his bedroom at night, causing four baseball team bobbleheads (from left to right, the Giants, the Pirates, the Dodgers, and the Rangers) to bobble. This attracts the attention of his bad-tempered father (George Wendt), who furiously remonstrates him to stop playing the music and go to bed. After his father exits out and slams the door behind him (causing a Michael Jackson poster on the door to fall off and its glass frame to smash), the boy retaliates by setting up large speaker cabinets hooked up to an amplifier (with levels of \"LOUD\", \"LOUDER\", and \"ARE YOU NUTS!?!\", respectively; with the dial turned up all the way to \"ARE YOU NUTS!?!\") behind his father's reclining chair, wearing leather gloves and sunglasses, strapping on an Ernie Ball Music Man EVH signature model guitar and playing a power chord, and telling the father to \"Eat this!\". The sound then shatters and destroys the house windows and sends his father (seated in the chair) through the roof and halfway around the world, where the actual song begins. The boy's mother (Tess Harper), suggests that his father will be very upset when he gets back. The album version of the song does not feature Culkin's nor Wendt's voice; they are replaced by voiceover artists performing a similar intro. The boy's father crashes in Africa, and Jackson sings \"Black or White\", surrounded by different cultures scene-by-scene.\n\nThe video shows scenes in which African Zulu hunters begin dancing by using moves from Southern African dance, with Jackson following their moves and them mirroring his; as do, in sequence, traditional Thai dancers, Plains Native Americans (located at the Vasquez Rocks formation in California), a Sri Lankan Odissi dancer and a group of Russians (wearing Ukrainian clothing and dancing Hopak), the final scene of which is contained in a snowglobe, two babies (one white and one black) are playing with. Jackson walks through visual collages of fire (defiantly declaring \"I ain't scared of no sheets; I ain't scared of nobody\"), referring to KKK torch ceremonies before a mock rap scene joined with Culkin and other children (including Jackson's niece Brandi and Wade Robson; as well as Mark Pugh and David Shelton of Another Bad Creation). The group collectively states, \"I'm not gonna spend my life being a color.\" The final verse is performed by Jackson on a large sculpted torch, which the camera pans out to reveal as the Statue of Liberty (New York). Jackson is seen singing on Lady Liberty's torch surrounded by other famous world structures including The Giza Sphinx (Egypt), Hagia Sophia (Turkey), Pamukkale (Turkey), The Parthenon (Greece), Taj Mahal (India), St. Basil's Cathedral (Moscow), Pyramids of Giza (Egypt), Golden Gate Bridge (San Francisco), Big Ben (London) and the Eiffel Tower (Paris).\n\nAt the end of the video, different people of different ethnicities and nationalities, including actor Glen Chin, voice actress Cree Summer, model Tyra Banks, actress Khrystyne Haje, and actor Jeffrey Anderson-Gunter, dance as they morph into one another (shown as \"talking heads\"). This technique, previously executed without digital assistance in the Godley & Creme video for \"Cry\", known as morphing, had been previously used only in movies such as \"Willow\" and \"\". The morphing visual effects were created by Pacific Data Images. In the extended version of the music video, after the song, a black panther walks out of the studio and emerges into Jackson, as he dances and destroys a glass bottle, a building window, and a parked car labeled with spray-painted racist words in a city street. After his damage, he re-emerges into the black panther. Finally, Bart Simpson from \"The Simpsons\" dances to the song while watching it on the TV. Homer yells at him to \"Turn off that noise!\" Bart replies, \"Chill out, Homeboy.\" Then, Homer angrily turns the TV off.\n\nThe music video of the song appears on the video albums: \"\" (long version), \"Video Greatest Hits – HIStory\" (long version, without graffiti on VHS version but with graffiti on DVD version), \"Number Ones\" (short version), and \"Michael Jackson's Vision\" (long version without graffiti).\n\nControversy was generated concerning the last four minutes of the original music video. Jackson walks out of the studio as a black panther and then morphs into himself. Then he walks outside to perform some of his most physically complicated dance techniques, in a similar way to \"Billie Jean\". The scene is also very similar to that of a commercial Jackson appeared in for L.A. Gear in 1989. This part contained sexually suggestive scenes when Jackson starts to grab his crotch, and then zips his pants up. In the original version, Jackson is seen smashing windows, destroying a car and causing an inn (called the \"Royal Arms\") to explode. Jackson later apologized saying that the violent and suggestive behavior was an interpretation of the animal instinct of a black panther, and MTV and other music video networks removed the last four minutes from subsequent broadcasts. To make the vandalism and violence more understandable to viewers, an altered version was produced, with racial messages added via CGI graffiti to the windows Jackson breaks. The version included in the boxed set \"Michael Jackson's Vision\" is the aired, televised version without the graffiti, and does not include the \"prejudice is ignorance\" title card.\n\nTo date, the uncut version has generally been seen in the United States on MTV2 only between the hours of 1:00 and 4:00, as part of their special uncut airing of the \"Most Controversial Music Videos\" of all time. The extended version is also available on Jackson's DVDs. The original version (without graffiti) is available on the DVD releases of \"Video Greatest Hits – HIStory\" with the VHS and Laserdisc release containing the aired version, and online at MTVMusic.com. It was still shown in its entirety for some years in Europe. Indeed, UK channel MTV Classic aired the full video at 14:00 on April 11, 2010, including the cameo appearance by Bart Simpson and Homer Simpson before the \"prejudice is ignorance\" image. MTV Classic have continued to air the full video post-watershed and recently aired in September 2012.\n\nThe uncut version was also shown in Australia at 11:45 pm AEST on Saturday June 2, 2012 as the first song on the weekly late night, guest-programmed music video show \"Rage\", on ABC1 and in Europe (except Italy, San Marino and the United Kingdom), on VH1 Classic at 21:30 CET on Saturday, September 29, 2018.\n\nThe first version made available in the iTunes Store contains neither the panther scene nor \"The Simpsons\" cameo, and is cut after the morphing sequence. Since then, a new version has been released with the graffiti and The Simpsons cameo called \"Black or White (Michael Jackson's Vision).\"\n\nStarting in 1992, Nocturne Video Productions began playing the \"Panther Segment\" of the video as an interlude during Michael's \"Dangerous\" world tour. The clip is 20 seconds shorter than the original, omitting all the violence and the sexually suggestive scenes. The scene of the pants re-zipping was retained. In predominantly Muslim countries during the HIStory Tour, the scene was replaced with the Carmina Burana \"Brace Yourself\" montage originally used as the intro in the previous Dangerous Tour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Black or White\" has been covered by some artists since its release.\n\n\nThe music video, particularly the \"Panther Segment\", have been referenced or parodied by television shows and artists.\n\n"}

It is a reimplementation of his 1998 game \"Keydom\".\n\nEach player controls a number of servants. The objective of the game is for each player to obtain as many artifacts as possible by buying them from the Caliph. In addition to being required to win, artifacts have magical powers which the player owning them can use to their advantage. In order to pay the Caliph for artifacts, the players must send servants to search for treasure.\n\nThe game board is divided into thirteen squares, each with a different effect. These in turn are divided into three areas: the bottom four squares represent the dragon caves, the middle four represent the town, and the top five represent the Caliph's palace. Each player has a set of servant tokens; each token is marked with a different number representing the power or skill of that servant. All players take turns placing servants (face down) in different squares on the board.

It was first published in 1901 by Eemil Nestor Setälä, a Finnish linguist.\n\nUnlike the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) notational standard which concentrates on accurately and uniquely transcribing the phonemes of a language, as well as their phonetic quality. For this reason, it is not possible to automatically convert a UPA transcription into an IPA one.\n\nThe basic UPA characters are based on the Finnish alphabet where possible, with extensions taken from Cyrillic and Greek orthographies. Small-capital letters and some novel diacritics are also used.\n\nUnlike the IPA, which is usually transcribed with upright characters, the UPA is usually transcribed with italic characters. Although many of its characters are also used in standard Latin, Greek, Cyrillic orthographies or the IPA, and are found in the corresponding Unicode blocks, many are not. These have been encoded in the \"Phonetic Extensions\" and \"Phonetic Extensions Supplement\" blocks. Font support for these extended characters is very rare; Code2000 and Fixedsys Excelsior are two fonts that do support them. A professional font containing them is Andron Mega; it supports UPA characters in Regular and Italics.\n\nA vowel to the left of a dot is illabial (unrounded); to the right is labial (rounded).\n\nOther vowels are denoted using diacritics.\n\nThe UPA also uses three characters to denote a vowel of uncertain quality:\n\nIf a distinction between close-mid vowels and open-mid vowels is needed, the IPA symbols for the open-mid basic front illabial and back labial vowels, and , can be used. However, in keeping with the principles of the UPA, the open-mid front labial and back illabial vowels are still transcribed with the addition of diacritics, as and .\n\nThe following table describes the consonants of the UPA. Note that the UPA does not distinguish voiced fricatives from approximants, and does not contain many characters of the IPA such as .\n\nWhen there are two or more consonants in a column, the rightmost one is voiced; when there are three, the centre one is partially devoiced.\nʔ denotes a voiced velar spirant.\n\nᴤ denotes a voiced laryngeal spirant.\n\nFor diphthongs, triphthongs and prosody, the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet uses several forms of the tie or double breve:\n\nA major difference is that IPA notation distinguishes between phonetic and phonemic transcription by enclosing the transcription between either brackets or slashes . UPA instead used italics for the former and half bold font for the latter.\n\nFor phonetic transcription, numerous small differences from IPA come into relevance:\n\nExamples:\nThis section contains some sample words from both Uralic languages and English (using Australian English) along with comparisons to the IPA transcription.\n\n"}

It is down the East Coast Main Line from .\n\nThe station is a major interchange serving both the north-south ECML, as well as long-distance and local east-west services. The station is managed by London North Eastern Railway. Ticket gates came into use at the station in 2012.\n\nThere have been a number of railway stations in Peterborough: Peterborough East (1845–1966), the current station which opened in 1850 (previously known by various names including Peterborough North); and briefly Peterborough Crescent (1858–1866).\n\nPeterborough was the site of the first mast to be installed as part of the ECML electrification project to Edinburgh. This can be found behind platform 1.\n\nPeterborough East opened on 2 June 1845 along with the Ely to Peterborough Line built by Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) and the Northampton and Peterborough Railway built by the London and Birmingham Railway, both of which provided routes to London. The Syston and Peterborough Railway by Midland Railway was opened in 1846. On 7 August 1862, the ECR became part of the Great Eastern Railway (GER).\n\nThe Great Northern Railway (GNR) arrived in Peterborough with the opening of the major portion of its \"loop line\" between Peterborough, Spalding, Boston and Lincoln, which opened on 17 October 1848; at first GNR trains used the ECR station at Peterborough East. During the construction of the GNR line south to London, it was decided that the GNR would need their own station at Peterborough; this was decided upon in December 1849, and opened on 7 August 1850 together with the new line, which originally terminated at Maiden Lane, the permanent London terminus at King's Cross not being ready until 14 October 1852. The GNR's Peterborough station is the current station, but it has had several names: originally simply \"Peterborough\", it later became \"Peterborough Priestgate\", then \"Peterborough Cowgate\" in 1902, reverting to \"Peterborough\" in 1911.\n\nOn 1 January 1923 the GER and GNR became constituents of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), which found itself with two similarly named stations in Peterborough; to distinguish them, they were given new names on 1 July 1923: the ex-GER station became \"Peterborough East\", and the ex-GNR station \"Peterborough North\". After Peterborough East closed on 6 June 1966, Peterborough North once again became \"Peterborough\", the name by which it is still known.\n\nThe Great Northern Railway heading north to Grantham and Doncaster (the Towns Line) opened in 1853 using the GNR station. This line was built alongside the Midland Railway as far as Helpston, resulting in adjacent but separate level crossings at various places, including the Crescent level crossings in Peterborough city centre.\n\nInterchange between Peterborough East and the GNR station was inconvenient, so on 1 February 1858 the Midland Railway opened Peterborough Crescent station, a short distance from the GNR station and close to the level crossing of the same name. Some GER trains were working through to the GNR Station by 1863. and the Crescent station closed on 1 August 1866 when Midland Railway trains began using the GNR station instead.\n\nThe Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway (M&GNR) branch to Wisbech and Sutton Bridge opened in 1866. To access this line trains headed north and diverged left at Westwood junction, then continued north adjacent to the Midland Railway line but gaining height, then curved east and bridged over the Midland line, the GNR line and Lincoln Road and headed off towards Eye Green along approximately the route of the current A47 Soke Parkway.\n\nServices to Rugby (by the London and North Western Railway from Peterborough East) and to Leicester (by the GNR from their Station) started in 1879 when the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) built a line from Yarwell junction near Wansford and Seaton linking the Northampton and Peterborough Railway and the Rugby and Stamford Railway. Also the Fletton curve via Woodston to Orton Waterville by the GNR.\n\nIn 1913 the two troublesome Crescent level crossings were finally abolished when Crescent Bridge was opened.\n\nRail services from the station were at their peak in 1910, before economies were made during World War I, most of which were never reversed.\n\nThe express services calling at Peterborough were mainly those between London and Leeds or York, but there were also through coaches to Grimsby via Spalding and Boston, to Cromer via the M&GNR line, to Sheffield Victoria and Manchester London Road via Retford and the Great Central line, and to Hull, Halifax, Blackburn, Harrogate and Bradford via Doncaster.\n\nBradford trains used a direct route either using the GNR line via Morley Top, or the LYR line via Thornhill.\n\nMost trains between London and Newcastle, and further north, passed through Peterborough without stopping, so it was usually necessary to change at Doncaster or York.\n\nIn 1910, the GNR were still running trains to Leicester via Wansford and Seaton, in direct competition with the Midland Railway which ran via Stamford. The GNR route and times were competitive but in 1910 they offered only three trains compared to six by the Midland Railway, and they did not serve any significant population centres en route.\n\nServices to Northampton and Rugby ran from the East station.\n\nGNR service to Leicester ended in 1916 during World War I. In March 1959 the line to Wisbech and to Sutton Bridge closed along with most of the rest of the M&GNR and local services on the GNR main line ended with a number of minor stations including Yaxley and Farcet and Tallington being closed.\n\nThe Northampton and Peterborough Railway closed in May 1964, followed 2 years later by the closure of Peterborough East station and the passenger services to Rugby in June 1966 (part of this line was eventually reopened as the Nene Valley Railway heritage line). The local services on the Syston and Peterborough Railway ceased in the same year with the closure of the remaining village stations including Helpston and Ketton & Collyweston.\n\nThe final closure came in October 1970 when the lines to Spalding, Boston and Grimsby were closed, although the Peterborough to Lincoln Line to Spalding was reopened on 7 June 1971 with a shuttle service of 3 trains each way per day. This service was improved in 1982 with the closure of the March to Spalding section of the former Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway when the Lincoln to Cambridge service became the Lincoln to Peterborough service.\n\nIn the 1970s major alterations occurred under British Rail to the former North station. In 1972 the track layout was remodelled, to provide high speed through lines and two new platforms. GNR bay platforms 4 and 5 (redundant since the withdrawal of East Lincolnshire line services) and through platform 6 were removed, together with all of the buildings between platforms 3 and 6, the new through lines scything through the site of the latter. New platforms 4 and 5, an island to the west of the fast lines, on the site of the former Midland Railway lines, were opened.\n\nIn 1976, the life-expired GNR booking hall and east side buildings were demolished, due to their condition, and were replaced by Portakabins. A contract was awarded to local company, Bernard Stokeley Ltd., to provide replacement buildings (which, with alterations, are those in use today) and these were opened a couple of years later.\n\nFurther new facilities were provided, post privatisation, as part of Great North Eastern Railway's £10 million station improvement programme to modernise facilities at key stations along the ECML. The modern travel centre is part of a £1 million upgrade which includes new passenger lounges on platforms 2 and 3 (since renumbered 1 and 2, following the closure of the original bay platform at the south end of the former platform 2), new toilet facilities on platforms 2 (now 1), 4 and 5, new customer information screens and improved security including the installation of CCTV cameras within the station and car park.\n\nA further major remodeling occurred in 2013, when three new platforms were opened and the original platform 1 bay was removed. Original platforms 2 and 3 were renumbered 1 and 2. A new platform face on the southbound through line was opened and numbered 3, together with a new island platform to the west of the station, on the site of the former fly-ash sidings and reversible freight line, these being numbered 6 and 7. Both the passenger footbridge and the former parcels bridge at the north end of the station were extended to the new island, lifts being added to the passenger footbridge.\n\nNetwork Rail spent a reported £2.5 million on Peterborough station and its surroundings, in a move that is intended to increase passenger capacity on trains and ease freight movements through the station. This upgrade has seen changes to the booking office and station concourse building along with the introduction of ticket gates. In addition some refurbishment work and changes have been made to the waiting rooms and other facilities on platform 4/5.\n\n\nThe station has a concourse and ticket office area which was internally redesigned and reopened in mid-2012. The concourse features both a newsagents and a cafe. \nFor general assistance there is a customer information point located on platform 1 by the concourse, as well as customer service offices on platform 5 and near the toilets on platform 2. All platforms are accessible by means of a passenger footbridge with lifts and also by a ramp bridge at the north end of the station.\n\nThere is on site car parking. Within a few minutes walk is Peterborough city centre, and the Queensgate shopping centre. As of March 2013, there is an automated cycle hire scheme outside the south end of the station building.\n\nThere are regular services to and from , operated by London North Eastern Railway and by Great Northern. Southbound EC services run either non-stop to the capital or call only at : northbound destinations include Edinburgh Waverley , , , , and (though many Scottish services now run non-stop from London to ).\n\nGreat Northern trains start and terminate at Peterborough (twice each hour with peak period extras Mon-Sat) and serve the intermediate stations southwards. This has now become a Thameslink service largely to and from Horsham.\n\nCrossCountry regional services run hourly between Birmingham via Leicester and Stansted Airport via .\n\nEast Midlands Railway are also hourly, between Norwich and Liverpool via , and Manchester Piccadilly. EMR also operate local services to Spalding, and Lincoln on an approximately hourly frequency (though morning peak and evening services only run as far as Spalding).\n\nGreater Anglia operate a two-hourly service to via Ely and .\n\nSunday services run less frequently on the ECML, but on similar frequencies on the regional routes other than the Spalding Line, which has no service.\n\n\nBelow are the routes that Peterborough is currently on, as well as those that it has been on in the past:\n\n\n"}

Jewett called Galatians 3:28 the \"Magna Carta of humanity\".\n\nJewett was an extremely controversial figure in evangelicalism beginning with his book \"Man as Male and Female\" which reconsidered traditional theology on the male/female relationship going so far as to suggest Paul was at times a chauvinistic and uninspired in some areas of the New Testament epistles.

It is down the line from and is situated between and on the main line.\n\nIt has four platforms, two of which serve the main line and the other two, located at a lower level and at right angles to the first pair, serve the Sheffield to Lincoln Line.\n\nThe first railway into Retford was the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway which opened on 16 July 1849 on their line between Sheffield (Bridgehouses) and Gainsborough. The Great Northern Railway line from Doncaster arrived on 4 September 1849 crossing the S&LJR on the level. It used the latter's station until its own was completed (on the site of today's higher-level platforms) on 1 August 1852. On 1 July 1859, the S&LJR (now the Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Railway) began using the GNR station via a short connecting curve, and closed its original station.\n\nThe higher-level platforms (numbered 1 and 2) respectively serve southbound and northbound East Coast Main Line trains operated by London North Eastern Railway which call at Retford. Platform 1 (on the eastern side of the layout) adjoins the main station building. Between the two platforms tracks there are two further lines, used by fast trains not booked to call here.\n\nPrior to the remodelling of the station, the two lines crossed at a flat crossing with a curve connecting the northern and eastern tracks, allowing trains on the Sheffield-Gainsborough line to call at the station. There were two northbound platforms - platform 2 (now closed) was on the eastern side of an island platform and platform 3 on the opposite side (still in use, now renumbered 2). Platform 1 handled southbound and eastbound trains. In addition, there was a single southbound line which passed in between platforms 1 and 2, rather than the two lines in place today. To relieve congestion on platform 1, there was a timber-built extension on the south curve (platform 1A) to allow Lincoln-bound trains to clear platform 1 proper.\n\nThe new lower-level platforms (originally numbered 4 and 5, now re-numbered 3 and 4) were added when the flat crossing between the two lines was removed and replaced with a bridge in 1965 and the Sheffield-Gainsborough tracks lowered to pass beneath the main line. These works also necessitated the removal of the direct north-to-east curve, meaning that trains between Sheffield and Lincoln could no longer call at the original platforms without a reversal.\n\nThe former Buffet and First Class Dining room on platform 1 are currently used as clubrooms by The Bassetlaw (North Notts) Railway Society. The club has installed an interesting display of local railway images in the windows of the rooms.\n\nThe station is staffed throughout the week, with most amenities (booking office, toilets, coffee shop and vending machine) in the main building on platforms 1. The ticket office is manned Monday - Friday 05:35 - 18:00, Saturday 05:35 - 16:10 and Sunday 08:20 - 16:10. A self-service ticket machine is also provided for use when the booking office is closed and for collecting pre-paid tickets. Train running information is offered via automated announcements, CIS displays and timetable posters. There are also customer help points on both low-level platforms, along with waiting shelters. All platforms are fully accessible for disabled passengers via lifts and a subway, although platform 3 (for Sheffield) can only be reached via a barrow crossing and requires staff assistance.\n\n\nBill Bryson comments of Retford station, in his book \"Notes from a Small Island\", that it is shown on railway maps in a typeface (and large filled circle graphic) marking it as equivalent to much more notable cities in northern England, and he therefore deemed it worth a visit.\n\nMichael Palin of Monty Python fame recalls frequently visiting Retford Station as a youngster for train spotting, as it was in easy reach of his home city of Sheffield and provided access to legendary locomotives like the \"Flying Scotsman\" running on the East Coast Main Line.\n\nThe station's High Level platforms are served by London North Eastern Railway on a basic two-hourly frequency each way Mon-Fri, northbound to and southbound to London King's Cross. Additional peak period services run to/from , Edinburgh and . A similar basic frequency also operates on Saturdays, but trains run through to Edinburgh or Leeds. Most services run by open access operator Hull Trains also call here.\n\nThe new Northern franchise agreement came into effect in April 2016 and significant improvements were made on the Sheffield to Lincoln Line with effect from the May 2019 timetable change. The service frequency to and from Sheffield has been doubled to 2 trains per hour on weekdays (hourly on Sundays). A new hourly stopping service to and from runs six days per week until early evening (giving that station its first regular daily service since October 1993), whilst the hourly service from Lincoln to (which are being rebranded as part of the \"Northern Connect\" network) now runs fast between Worksop and Sheffield during the daytime.\n\nOn Saturdays only, there are also three trains to and via .\n\nA small number of trains from Sheffield start/terminate here, including two that use the surviving connection via \"Whisker Hill Junction\" to reach platform 2 at High Level (a practice that was much more common in the 1970s when the Lincoln route had fewer through trains).\n\n"}

The collection focused on traditional African art and an educational mission to teach black cultural heritage. To ensure the museum's longevity, the founder lobbied the national legislature to adopt the museum under the Smithsonian's auspices. It joined the Smithsonian in 1979 and became the National Museum of African Art two years later. A new, mostly underground museum building was completed in 1987, just off the National Mall and adjacent to other Smithsonian museums. It is among the Smithsonian's smallest museums.\n\nThe African art museum took a scholarly direction over the next twenty years, with less social programming. It collected traditional and contemporary works of historical importance. Exhibitions include works both internal and borrowed, and have ranged from solo artist to broad, survey shows. The museum hosts two to three temporary exhibitions and ten special events annually. Reviewers criticized the National Mall building's architecture, particularly its lack of natural light. The museum is scheduled for remodeling as part of the Smithsonian's upcoming South Mall project.\n\nIn the 1950s, American Foreign Service officer Warren M. Robbins collected African figures, masks, books, and textiles from German antique shops. Upon returning to Washington, D.C., in 1960, he purchased a house on Capitol Hill and opened his collection for viewing. Robbins, without museum, arts, or fundraising experience, believed that the collection could advance interracial civil rights and improve national respect for a major component of black cultural heritage. Starting in 1963, he expanded his Capitol Hill house museum into adjacent townhouses, including the former house of abolitionist Frederick Douglass. The collections eventually occupied nine townhouses and over a dozen other properties near the Supreme Court Building.\n\nThe museum was formally founded in 1964 as the Museum of African Art, and its first show consisted of the collection and two outside pieces. Under Robbins's tenure, the museum focused on traditional African art and its educational mission to teach black cultural heritage. It also served as a convivial meeting place for individuals interested in American racial politics, in keeping with the 1960s and '70s Black Arts Movement effort to change American perceptions towards African cultures. Robbins referred to his museum as \"an education department with a museum attached\". By 1976, the African art museum had a 20-person staff, 6,000-object collection, and Robbins had visited Africa for the first time.\n\nTo ensure the museum's longevity, Robbins lobbied the national legislature (Congress) to absorb his museum into the Smithsonian Institution, a federal group of museums and research centers. The House of Representatives approved this plan in 1978 with backing from Representatives John Brademas, Lindy Boggs, Ron Dellums, the Congressional Black Caucus, and former Vice President Hubert Humphrey. The Smithsonian directors adopted the museum the next year and began plans to move the collection from the townhouses into a proper museum. In 1981, the museum was renamed the National Museum of African Art.\n\nIn early 1983, Sylvia Williams became the museum's director. Later that year, the Smithsonian broke ground on a new, dedicated building for the African art museum on the National Mall. The complex was situated mostly underground, and expanded the museum's exhibition space upon its September 1987 opening. Over time, perspectives towards African art shifted from ethnographic interest to the study of traditional objects for their craftsmanship and aesthetic properties. Williams took a scholarly, art historian approach to the museum, and pursued risky, high-cost pieces before their ultimate values were settled. The collection expanded into contemporary works and works from Arab North Africa, beyond the traditional Sub-Saharan. The museum's founder criticized this direction and felt that the institution was neglecting its public role for \"esoteric scholarship\".\n\nFollowing Williams's death in 1996, curator Roslyn Walker, served as director from 1997 through her 2002 retirement. Walker continued the direction of her predecessor and added a dedicated contemporary art gallery and curator. She also created a development office, which raised money for an early 2000s renovation of the museum's pavilion. Sharon Patton, former director of Oberlin College's Allen Memorial Art Museum, served as director between 2003 and 2008. Her tenure included more shows targeting children and an advisory board mass resignation over Smithsonian leadership.\n\nJohnnetta Cole, an anthropologist and former president of Spelman and Bennett College, became the museum's director in 2009. Her tenure became associated with a controversial 2015 exhibit that featured works from comedian Bill Cosby's private collection just as allegations of sexual assault against him became public. Two years earlier, the 2013 federal budget sequestration closed one of the museum's permanent exhibitions. Cole retired in March 2017 and was succeeded by British filmmaker and curator Gus Casely-Hayford in February 2018.\n\nAs of the late 2000s, \"The Washington Post\" wrote that the museum struggled with low attendance, modest budget, concealed location, and leadership turnovers. Thirty years after joining the Smithsonian, the museum remains one of the smallest museums in the complex, with 213,000 visitors in 2016about half of the 2009 count and less than one percent of the 28 million annual Smithsonian visitors. This is due, in part, to its location, which is hidden from the National Mall by the original Smithsonian Institution Building, known as the Castle. Visitor numbers have fluctuated between 200,000 and 400,000 since the 2000s, and in the mid-2000s were comparable with its underground neighbor museum, the Sackler Gallery. The museum's annual budget has fluctuated from $4.3 million (late 1990s) to $6 million (mid-2000s), and was $5 million in 2016. By comparison, the museum had a 34-person staff in 2016, down from 48 in the late 1990s. Like many other museums in the 2000s, the institute has sought private funding and endowments. It trailed behind other Smithsonian entities in fundraising campaigns, into which the museum was expected to pay about $2.1 million. In late 2016, the museum held its first annual African Arts Awards Dinner for over 500 guests.\n\nThe museum's National Mall building construction began in mid-1983. The project, which also included the Sackler Gallery for the Smithsonian's Asian art, created 368,000 square feet of exhibition space at a cost of $73.2 million, half of which from the federal government. Almost all of this room was created underground so as not to affect the quadrangle's landmark Smithsonian Institution Building (the Castle), its greenery, or its view. The Smithsonian Castle hides the museum and South Quadrangle from the National Mall, which has contributed to the museum's lower attendance compared with other Mall attractions. The quadrangle project's design architect was Jean-Paul Carlhian of Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson & Abbott, based on a concept by Junzō Yoshimura. The two new museums had little involvement in the architectural designs, which were drawn in the 1970s prior to their arrival.\n\nThe African art and Sackler buildings were built as twin pavilions, each one story above ground and with similar display space: five galleries each, and only one with natural light. They are differentiated by their roof adornments: domes on the African art building and pyramids on the Sackler. The African art pavilion was built in red granite and uses the circle shape as its architectural theme, with round windows, rounded entrance staircase, and six, round domes on its roof. Inside, a limestone foyer overlooks the gardens and a curving stair hall leads visitors down curving stairs to the galleries. The galleries are large and customized by exhibition designers into smaller rooms to better suit small objects. The buildings are visible from Independence Avenue, and the new Enid A. Haupt Garden runs between them and the Smithsonian Institution Building. Underground, the museum and offices occupy the first two levels, and a third level hosts exhibition and educational rooms. Its levels are connected by a three-story enclosed arcade with large skylights set into the gardens above, through several feet of dirt. The pavilion was renovated in the early 2000s with a major donation from Eastman Kodak.\n\nThe museum is scheduled for remodeling as part of the $2 billion Smithsonian South Mall project. Plans from the Danish architects, Bjarke Ingels Group, would replace the above-ground pavilion with new mall-facing entrances. The renovation is supported by private and federal investment, and was expected to begin in 2016 and finish in 10 to 20 years. Yinka Shonibare's \"Wind Sculpture VII\" was put on permanent display outside the museum in late 2016.\n\nThe National Museum of African Art was the first institution dedicated to African art in the United States, followed by the New York-based Center for African Art (now The African Center) in 1984. The National Museum's collection is larger. As of 2008, it consisted of 9,000 objects and 300,000 photographs. The objects range from 15th-century sculptures and masks to multi-media contemporary art, and the photographs include major contributions from photojournalists Eliot Elisofon and Constance Stuart Larrabee. Elisofon covered major 20th century events for \"Life\", and Larrabee covered World War II and South African life. As of 2004, the museum had 400 contemporary artworks. The museum collects items for both their traditional uses and aesthetic values, and receives an average of 67 gifts annually. The breadth of its collections and special exhibitions made the museum \"a solid force in the international art world\" and the main venue for contemporary African art in the United States, according to \"The Washington Post\".\n\nAs the museum moved to the National Mall in the mid 1980s, its permanent collection consisted of more than 6,000 art objects (e.g., sculpture, artifacts, textiles) and the large Elisofon photography collection. This original collection focused on Sub-Saharan Africa, with better representation of the Guinea coast and Western Sudan than the Central African region. The collection is idiosyncratic, reflecting the relative lack of colonial era African art acquisitions in American donor collections. Some early highlights of the museum's collection include an Edo–Portuguese ivory spoon and an Akan gold pendant bequeathed by the Robert Woods Bliss estate. The museum's first acquisitions budget came with joining the Smithsonian.\n\nWithin a decade, the collection had expanded to 7,000 traditional and modern objects from across all of Africa. Under Walker's tenure, the museum expanded its contemporary art collection, opening a permanent gallery in 1997. That year, photographer Constance Stuart Larrabee gave the museum 3,000 photographs from South Africa. In 2005, the museum received the Walt Disney-Tishman Collection of 525 works spanning most major African art styles and 75 cultures. The acquisition was a validation of the museum's status, given the other institutions who vied for the collection. The museum's library also grew upon joining the Smithsonian, from 3,000 to 30,000 volumes in visual arts, anthropology, cooking, history, religion, and travel, especially works published in Africa. It now contains 50,000 volumes.\n\nThe museum hosted 130 special exhibitions in its first 25 years, and since joining the Smithsonian, hosts two to three temporary exhibitions annually. In its pre-Smithsonian years, the museum's exhibitions were often loaned, such as from the Renee and Chaim Gross Foundation. In the early '80s, its curators organized \"focus\" exhibitions centered around a single object from the collection. The museum hosted outside curators and traveling exhibitions. Its shows became more ambitious as its museum relations and budget grew. At the opening of the National Mall building, the museum showed 375 works in five small- and mid-sized exhibits with survey and single-theme scopes. The central exhibit, \"African Art in the Cycle of Life\", exhibited 88 items in seven sections following seven phases of African tribal life so as to provide social context for their use. For example, sections such as \"Continuity\" displayed hand-carved maternity figures, \"Transition\" displayed coming-of-age ceremonial masks, and \"Towards a Secure World\" displayed priest and healer items. Many of the pieces were masterpieces borrowed from American and European museums and private collections. Another exhibit showed 100 items from the museum's own collection. The remaining three exhibits were smaller: West African textiles, Benin sculptures and copper reliefs, and useful objects like baskets, hairpins, and snuff boxes. The exhibitions were chosen to confront stereotypes of African art as overly \"expressive, ritualistic, and ... undocumented\", and instead show perspectives overlooked in Western views on African art.\n\nDuring the Walker yearsthe late '90s and early 2000sthe museum hosted shows on Egyptian contemporary art and Malagasy textiles. A 1997 gift from photographer Constance Stuart Larrabee led to an in-house and traveling exhibition. Walker organized a 1998 retrospective of Yoruba sculptor Olowe of Ise, a rare example of a single-person African art show. The exhibition's accompanying catalogue raisonne was the first such scholarly publication for a traditional African artist. The museum has also held solo exhibitions for artists including Sokari Douglas Camp (1989) and Yinka Shonibare (2010). Exhibitions aimed towards children, such as \"Playful Performers\", drew crowds under Patton's directorship in the mid-2000s, as did \"Treasures\" shows from the museum's collection and artist visits. A 2004 show, \"Insights\", highlighted 30 works about Apartheid South Africa from its collection. In 2013, the museum received its largest gift, $1.8 million from Oman, towards a series that focuses on arts from the country and its links to cultures in the Near East.\n\nThe 2015 \"Conversations: African and African-American Artworks in Dialogue\", featuring works from the private collection of Bill and Camille Cosby, became controversial for opening just as allegations of sexual assault against him became public. The museum's director had a long friendship with the CosbysCamille also sat on the museum's advisory board. The exhibition was funded by a $716,000 donation from the Cosbys and had been planned to bring attention to the museum for its 50th anniversary. As the number of allegations increased, the museum recognized public outcry against the exhibition by creating a sign that acknowledged the allegations and refocused attention on the show's artists and artworks, which remained on view. \"The Washington Post\" art and architecture critic Philip Kennicott wrote that the museum violated ethics and hurt its reputation by showcasing a private collection that had not been pledged to the museum. Kennicott challenged whether the painters of Cosby's blue chip collection would have been \"silenced\" by ending the exhibition early.\n\nThe museum prioritized education in its early, pre-Smithsonian years. Its founder referred to the institution as \"an education department with a museum attached\". The museum had an intimate atmosphere and emphasized programs that taught black cultural heritage. Many children from local schools attended the museum, which hosted exhibits including an exercise on \"how to look at art\" in comparing traditional African and modern art. Through the '90s, school groups took guided tours with trained docents. The new location on the National Mall increased the museum's unguided visits.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Smithsonian found that few of its 20 million annual visitors were of a racial minority despite the city's large black population, and created a committee to address the disparity. As the African art museum had not yet moved to the National Mall, it served a black constituency in a racially mixed neighborhood, with racially integrated staff and programming popular among local school groups with its regular films, folk stories, and lectures. The museum also offered workshops on African stripweave and talking drum. Patton, museum director in the mid-2000s, said that the museum was not well known in Washington, as only half of taxi drivers knew its location. Patton's tenure included shows targeted towards children. As a result, the museum briefly served more children than adults. Around this time, the museum held about 10 special events a year. \"The Washington Post\" wrote that the museum \"struggled ... to attract visitors and donations\" in 2016, which was exacerbated by the Cosby controversy.\n\nAt the National Mall building's opening, three \"New York Times\" reviewers criticized elements of its design, namely the architect's choice of materials and lack of natural light underground. Architecture critic Paul Goldberger considered the above-ground elements a \"clunky ... pavilion of granite\" whose elements were \"woefully simplistic\", unsubtle, and awkward compared to the Smithsonian castle in the distance. He mildly praised the complex's \"clever\" layout and its maximized underground utility with minimal above-ground changes. Goldberger admired the building's craftsmanship, interiors, and responsive gallery spaces. The other two \"Times\" reviewers, in turn, were unsettled to see works once associated with the outdoors instead displayed with no natural light, and feared the precedent for other museums, adding that the lack of light was unaccommodating to both viewers and the works. The museum's director, however, noted that natural light would cause conservation issues for their wood sculptures. The museum felt restrained as part of the larger complex, one critic wrote, and deficient in style.\n\nOf the opening exhibition, the \"New York Times\" critic described the exhibits as often austere and understated in irregularly sized rooms that sometimes overwhelmed its contents. She was fondest of the small exhibits and the works imported from other museums. The other \"Times\" reviewer found the museum's collection larger but \"less spectacular\" than that of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, though the latter had more works available when it began its collection. The opening exhibits, overall, piqued viewer curiosity in the subject and underscored the importance of religious belief and craftsmanship in the displayed works. The opening's reviewer struggled to generalize the African works, which ranged from face- and figure-focused to the elegant, geometric abstraction of West African strip weaving. The other reviewer added that the museum's textiles exhibition overemphasized the connection between African art and everyday life, as the textiles had comparatively weaker \"imaginative ... impact\".\n\n\"It's impossible\", a reviewer wrote in \"The Washington Times\", \"not to be profoundly moved\" by the museum's 2004 Apartheid exhibition. She praised the museum's contemporary collection but said that the works fought against their surroundingsthe dedicated contemporary gallery was a good space with a poor ambiance.\n\n"}

It is down the line from and is situated on the main line between to the south and to the north.\n\nTwo secondary lines diverge from the main line north of Grantham: the \"Poacher Line\" to and a branch line to .\n\nIts three-letter station code is GRA.\n\nThe original station at Grantham (Old Wharf) was opened when the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston & Eastern Junction Railway opened its line from Nottingham on 15 July 1850. This line was taken over by the Great Northern Railway in 1854. This was replaced by the present station which opened on 1 August 1852; the Old Wharf station closed the following day.\n\nThe new station was on the GNR's direct line between Peterborough and Retford (the Towns Line), which was completed in 1852. The alternative route via Boston and Lincoln (the Fens Loop Line) had already opened in 1850. The Boston, Sleaford and Midland Counties Railway opened their line from Barkston Junction, 2 miles north of Grantham, to Sleaford in 1857, and on to Boston in 1859. This railway was taken over by the GNR in 1864. The Grantham to Lincoln line, which branched off the Sleaford line at , was opened in 1867. Finally, the Great Northern and London and North Western Joint Railway was opened in 1879. This ran from and in the south, through Melton Mowbray to and Newark in the north, crossing the Grantham to Nottingham line near . The GNR operated a Grantham to Leicester service via this route.\n\nThe early life of the station was marred by some unfortunate accidents. On 25 July 1868, William Collins, a GNR cleaner, was run over by a guard’s van and killed. On 4 November 1868, John Boswell, aged 80, was wandering along the line near the station when he was killed by a down train. On 23 May 1873, Thomas Robinson, a GNR engine driver, was struck fatally by a ballast-engine whilst crossing the yard at the station. On 12 March 1887, Eli Addlesee, a driver, was killed by some wagons being shunted in the station On 27 November 1898, John William Frisby, a GNR shunter, was killed whilst crossing the line near the station.\n\nIn 1937, the LNER announced that they planned to lengthen the down platform. At long it was too short to accommodate the increasing length of the main line express trains, and the work would extend it to . At the same time the whole platform length was to be raised to a standard height of and a new awning over the platform opposite the station buildings would be added.\n\n\nJunctions near the town also connect to branches to Nottingham, and to Sleaford and Skegness. The station was built close to the factory of Richard Hornsby & Sons.\n\nIt is composed of four platforms; platforms 1 and 2 are on the East Coast Main Line and are responsible for express services between London and Scotland. Platform 1 serves exclusively London King's Cross via Peterborough and Stevenage; Platform 2 serves cities of northern England and Edinburgh. Platform 2, 3 and 4 are formed from a large island platform structure. Platform 3 is a bay platform at the northern end of the station that is used to allow local trains to reverse, while Platform 4 is a two-way platform that is used by East Midlands Railway. Only Platform 1 has amenities, including toilets, refreshments and a buffet.\n\nPrior to the reopening of the Allington Chord in 2006, trains for Nottingham – Grantham – Skegness reversed in the station and travelled along the ECML, crossing the ECML via a flat junction, adding to congestion on the main line. Since the opening of the chord they reverse and travel whence they came using the chord, crossing under the ECML using existing tracks.\n\nThe journey to London King's Cross takes a little over an hour, with trains provided by London North Eastern Railway and Hull Trains\n\nIn May 2009 National Express East Coast installed ticket barriers. These have since been removed however.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2320647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320647", "title": "Adam Elsheimer", "text": "Adam Elsheimer\n\nAdam Elsheimer (18 March 1578 – 11 December 1610) was a German artist working in Rome who died at only thirty-two, but was very influential in the early 17th century in the field of Baroque paintings. His relatively few paintings were small scale, nearly all painted on copper plates, of the type often known as cabinet paintings. They include a variety of light effects, and an innovative treatment of landscape. He was an influence on many other artists, including Rembrandt and Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nElsheimer was born in Frankfurt am Main, one of ten children and the son of a master-tailor. His father's house (which survived until destroyed by Allied bombs in 1944) was a few metres from the church where Albrecht Dürer's \"Heller Altarpiece\" was then displayed. He was apprenticed to the artist Philipp Uffenbach. He probably visited Strasbourg in 1596. At the age of twenty, he travelled to Italy via Munich, where he is documented in 1598.\n\nHis stay in Venice is undocumented, but the influence on his style is clear. He probably worked as an assistant to Johann Rottenhammer, some of whose drawings he owned. Rottenhammer was a German who had been living in Italy for some years, and was the first German painter to specialize in cabinet paintings. Uffenbach had specialized in large altarpieces, and although Elsheimer's earliest small paintings on copper seem to date from before he arrived in Italy, Rottenhammer's influence is clear on his mature work.\n\nElsheimer is believed to have produced some significant works in Venice, such as \"The Baptism of Christ \"(National Gallery, London) and \"The Holy Family\" (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin) which show the influence of the Venetian painters Tintoretto and Paolo Veronese, as well as Rottenhammer.\nIn early 1600, Elsheimer arrived in Rome and quickly made friends with contacts of Rottenhammer, notably Giovanni Faber, a Papal doctor, botanist and collector originally from Bamberg. He was Curator of the Vatican Botanical Garden, and a member of the Accademia dei Lincei, a small intellectual coterie founded in 1603, and mainly concerned with the natural sciences.\n\nAnother friend of Rottenhammer was the Flemish landscape painter Paul Bril, already established in Rome, who was (with Faber) a witness at Elsheimer's marriage, painted a picture together with him (now Chatsworth House), and was owed money by him at his death. Like Faber, Bril was a long-term resident in Rome who had converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism, as Elsheimer did later.\n\nBoth Faber and Bril knew Rubens, who was in Rome in 1601, and who became another friend, later reproaching Elsheimer for not producing more work. He knew David Teniers the Elder, recently Rubens' pupil, and there is evidence that they lodged together. In 1604 Karel van Mander, a Dutchman recently returned from Rome, published his \"Schilder-Boeck\" which praised Elsheimer's work, and described him as slow-working and making few drawings. He also spent much time in churches, studying the works of the masters. Other writers mention his exceptional visual memory, his melancholy and his kind-heartedness. In a letter after his death, Rubens wrote: \"he had no equal in small figures, landscapes, and in many other subjects. ...one could have expected things from him that one has never seen before and never will see.\" \n\nIn 1606, Elsheimer married Carola Antonia Stuarda da Francoforte (i.e. Stuart of Frankfurt- she was of Scottish ancestry and a fellow Frankfurter), and in 1609 they had a son. The son was not mentioned in a census a year later, possibly (Klessman says optimistically) because he had been put out to a wet-nurse. She was the recent widow of the artist Nicolas de Breul (born in Verdun) and after Elsheimer's death remarried an Italian artist, Ascanio Quercia, within a year of his death. Elsheimer converted to Catholicism by 1608 (possibly 1606). He was admitted to the Accademia di San Luca, the Roman painters' Guild, in 1606, giving them a self-portrait (his only portrait, and only painting on canvas) now in the Uffizi. In spite of his fame and talents, he appears to have both lived and died in difficult financial circumstances.\n\nElsheimer's painting of \"Tobias and the Angel\" (1602–1603) (the \"small\" Tobias - now at Frankfurt) was especially well received because of its new conception of landscape. This picture was engraved by Count Hendrick Goudt and as a result was published across Europe. However, his association with Goudt, who lodged and trained with him for several years, was difficult. Elsheimer seems to have borrowed money from Goudt, which according to one account resulted in his brief incarceration in Debtor's prison. After Elsheimer's early death in 1610 in Rome, Goudt owned several of his pictures. Goudt made seven engravings of Elsheimer's paintings, which were crucial in spreading his influence, as very few of his paintings were viewable even by artists; as cabinet paintings they were mostly kept in small and very private rooms.\n\nElsheimer had a definite preference for choosing rare or original subjects, both for his mythological and religious paintings. \"Jupiter and Mercury in the house of Philemon and Baucis\", (c. 1608, now Dresden) is based on an episode in Ovid, and had never been painted before. \"The Mocking of Ceres \"(Kingston, Ontario, a copy exists in the Prado), \"Apollo and Coronis\" (Liverpool), and \"Il Contento\" (Edinburgh) were equally new. Some of his religious scenes were more conventional, but his selection of the moment to depict, as in \"St Lawrence prepared for Martyrdom\" (London), is often unusual.\n\nHis perfectionism, and an apparent tendency to depression, resulted in a small total output, despite the small size of all his pictures. In all about forty paintings are now generally agreed to be by him (see Kressmann below). He made a few etchings, not very successfully. However, his work was highly regarded by other artists and a few important collectors for its quality. He had a clear and direct influence on other Northern artists who were in Rome such as Paul Bril, Jan Pynas, Leonaert Bramer and Pieter Lastman, later Rembrandt's master, who was probably in Rome by 1605. Rembrandt's first dated work is a \"Stoning of St Stephen\" which appears to be a response to Elsheimer's painting of the subject, now in Edinburgh. Some works by Italian artists, such as the six pictures from Ovid by Carlo Saraceni now in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples, also show Elsheimer's clear influence. Rubens, who owned at least four of his works, knew Elsheimer in Rome, and praised him highly in a letter after his death.\n\nIn a wider sense, he was influential in three respects. Firstly his night scenes were highly original. His lighting effects in general were very subtle, and very different from those of Caravaggio. He often uses as many as five different sources of light, and graduates the light relatively gently, with the less well-lit parts of the composition often containing important parts of it.\n\nSecondly, his combination of poetic landscape with large foreground figures gives the landscape a prominence that had rarely been seen since the Early Renaissance. His landscapes do not always feature an extensive view; often the lushness of the vegetation closes it off. They are more realistic, but no less poetic, than those of Bril or Jan Brueghel, and play a part in the formation of those of Poussin and Claude. His treatment of large figures with a landscape backdrop looks forward, through Rubens and van Dyck, to the English portrait in the eighteenth century. Soon after his death he became very popular with English collectors, notably King Charles I of England, the Earl of Arundel, and George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and over half his paintings have been in English collections at some time (nearly one third are still in the UK).\n\nThirdly, his integration of Italian styles with the German tradition he was trained in is perhaps more effective than that of any Northern painter since Dürer (with the exception of his friend Rubens). His compositions tend to underplay the drama of the events they depict (in noticeable contrast to those of Rubens), but often show the start of moments of transformation. His figures are relatively short and stocky, and reflect little of classical ideals. Their poses and gestures are unflamboyant, and their facial expressions resemble those in Early Netherlandish painting rather than the \"bella figura\" of most Italian Renaissance work.\n\nThe largest collection of his work is in Frankfurt.

Pleasant, Texas to Greenville, Texas. In 2010, Blacklands Railroad expanded to operate another shortline, The Henderson-Overton Branch (HOB), that stretched from Overton, Texas to Henderson, Texas. Blacklands Railroad further diversified in 2014 by creating a subsidiary, Black Gold Terminals, that specializes in transloading, contract switching, and industrial rail parks. Blacklands Railroad was awarded the Short Line Railroad of the Year in 2011 by Railway Age.\n\nThe St. Louis, Arkansas, & Texas Railroad was built through Sulphur Springs, Texas, in 1887 on its way to Commerce and Sherman . The next year the line was completed to Fort Worth. In 1891, the bankrupt railroad was sold to Jay Gould Interests and renamed the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, also known as the Cotton Belt. This line became the basis of Blacklands Railroad, but not before portions of it were owned by Southern Pacific and Union Pacific.\n\nThe Northeast Texas Rural Rail Transportation District (NETEX) purchased the segment between Greenville, Texas and Sulphur Springs in 1995 (from the Southern Pacific), and the remainder of the line in 2000 (from Union Pacific) . In 1999, Blacklands Railroad was awarded the contract to operate the 65.6 mile line, from Greenville where it interchanges with Kansas City Southern to Sulphur Springs (another KCS interchange) and finally Mount Vernon, Texas near the Franklin/Titus county line; from this point Blacklands Railroad operates via Union Pacific trackage rights to Mount Pleasant, Texas where it interchanges with Union Pacific.\n\nOver the years, Blacklands Railroad traffic has included a host of commodities including forest products, scrap materials, plastic, grain, chemicals, and steel.\n\nOriginally chartered in 1874, the Henderson-Overton Branch was completed in 1877. The line ran 15 miles from a connection with the International and Great Northern Railway in Overton, Texas to Henderson, Texas, with various industries along the way. The Henderson-Overton Branch was acquired by the International and Great Northern on September 27, 1880, and was operated by the latter company until it was consolidated with the newly reorganized International and Great Northern Railway Company on August 31, 1911. Through mergers and acquisitions, the branch was owned by a number of railroads, including the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad, before finally landing with Union Pacific Railroad.\n\nUnion Pacific provided notice to abandon the line in 2008, citing lack of traffic on the branch . The Henderson-Overton Branch was subsequently purchased by Rusk County Rail District in 2010. Blacklands Railroad was chosen by Rusk County Rail District to operate the line for the benefit of existing customers, primarily a lumber mill in Henderson, and new businesses which may be interested in locating along the line. \n\nIn 2017, Blacklands Railroad established a transload site in Henderson under its Black Gold Terminals subsidiary to help customers in the area gain access to the rail network even if they were not located on the railroad.\n\nHOB commodities include asphalt, steel, lumber, and chemicals. \n\nBlack Gold Terminals was created in 2017 as a subsidiary of Blacklands Railroad. Blacklands Railroad leveraged its knowledge and experience in the rail industry to provide an additional service to shippers looking to move goods by rail, regardless of whether they have direct rail access. Specializing in transloading, contract switching, and industrial rail parks, Black Gold Terminals operates transload facilities in Henderson, Texas; Odessa, Texas; Reno, Nevada; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. \n\n"}

It is most commonly used in the acute treatment of convulsive status epilepticus.\nFosphenytoin was developed in 1996. On 18 November 2004, Sicor (a subsidiary of Teva) received a tentative approval letter from the United States Food and Drug Administration for a generic version of fosphenytoin.\n\nFosphenytoin is approved in the United States for the short term (five days or fewer) treatment of epilepsy when more widely used means of phenytoin administration are not possible or are ill-advised, such as endotracheal intubation, status epilepticus or some other type of repeated seizures; vomiting, and/or the patient is unalert or not awake or both.\n\nIn 2003, it was reported that even though anticonvulsants are often very effective in mania, and acute mania requires rapid treatment, fosphenytoin had no antimanic effect.\n\nOne millimole of phenytoin is produced for every millimole of fosphenytoin administered; the hydrolysis of fosphenytoin also yields phosphate and formaldehyde, the latter of which is subsequently metabolized to formate, which is in turn metabolized by a folate dependent mechanism.\n\nSide effects are similar to intravenous phenytoin and include hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, CNS adverse events (nystagmus, dizziness, sedation/somnolence, ataxia and stupor), and local dermatological reactions. Purple glove syndrome probably occurs with fosphenytoin but possibly at lower frequency than with intravenous phenytoin. Fosphenytoin can cause hyperphosphatemia in end-stage renal failure patients.\n\nPhenytoin, in both its acidic and sodium salt forms, is erratically bioavailable whether it is injected or taken orally due to its high melting point, weak acidity, and its being only sparingly soluble in water. Simply putting patients on other drugs is not always an option; this was especially true before 1993, when the number of anticonvulsants available was much more limited. One solution was to develop a prodrug that did not have these drawbacks.\n\nFosphenytoin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 5, 1996 for use in epilepsy.\n\n"}

The station is north of London King's Cross on the East Coast Main Line. Stevenage is managed and served by Great Northern. It is also served by Hull Trains and London North Eastern Railway.\n\nThe present station was opened for trains on 23 July 1973 It was officially opened on 26 September 1973 by Shirley Williams, then MP for Stevenage, replacing the previous station, which was to the north, and further away from the centre of the new town. The station was built by British Rail.\n\nThe original Stevenage railway station was built in 1850 by the Great Northern Railway, despite the apparent hostility towards the railway being built there at that time due to the inevitable decline it would cause to local coach businesses, which all ended shortly after the station was opened.\n\nIn 1946, Stevenage became one of the first New Towns, which resulted in a new town centre. In 1973, the railway station was relocated south, within walking distance () of the new town centre.\n\nThe station has two separate ticket offices (Great Northern and London North Eastern Railway), but in practice, each sell each other's tickets. There are also seven ticket machines. There are toilets at street level (but not on the platforms) and lifts from the station building to both platforms.\nThe station also has automatic ticket barriers, which were installed by First Capital Connect (the previous train operator) shortly after it took over the route, as a revenue protection exercise, and to improve security at the station. There is a snack bar, at street level, and two coffee bars at platform level, with one per platform. The newsagent previously at street level closed in March 2014, pending the redevelopment of the station which has since been completed.\nSince December 2013, the previous train operator, First Capital Connect started refurbishing the station completely, introducing passenger lifts between platform and street level, and refurbishing the concourse area plus retail units. The works were due to be completed by April 2014, but were delayed. Since Great Northern took over the franchise in September 2014, these works have been completed.\n\nBoth island platforms have indoor waiting rooms that were refurbished in May 2012 as part of a wider scheme to refurbish and add waiting rooms across the Great Northern Route, and there is also outdoor seating along the length of the platforms.\n\nThe station is a short walk on a walkway from Stevenage Bus Station and is opposite a leisure complex that includes the Gordon Craig Theatre.\n\nBefore May 2018, most of the trains serving Stevenage station were operated by Great Northern, lying on its Great Northern Route from London King's Cross to Peterborough and Cambridge. It was served by trains between London and Letchworth via Hertford North; these trains use Moorgate station in London. In May 2018 however, most Great Northern services were swapped with Thameslink services, and now the only Great Northern train is one southbound departure per hour to Moorgate at weekends only calling at all stations via Hertford North, and some weekday peak-hour trains between London King's Cross and . On weekdays, services to (hourly) and (2 per hour) are replaced by buses whilst construction work on the extra platform at the station is ongoing (see below).\n\nThe Saturday and Sunday service is:\n\nStevenage is also served by some London North Eastern Railway services on the East Coast Main Line. During the day, there is an hourly service between London King's Cross and Leeds and an hourly service between King's Cross and Newark North Gate (extended to every 2 hours); at other times there are also services to Edinburgh Waverley and Newcastle. These services use platform 2 southbound and platform 3 northbound.\n\nHull Trains offer a very limited service, only calling at Stevenage on Sunday afternoons, 1 train northbound and 2 trains southbound. This service runs between King's Cross and Hull.\n\nNew services were rolled out in 2018 under the Thameslink Programme. The East Coast Mainline/Great Northern routes, from Peterborough and Cambridge and stations in between, including Stevenage, became connected to Thameslink via the Canal Tunnels and destinations south of central London.\n\n\nGovia Thameslink Railway (the operator of Great Northern services) has long aspired to terminate all services on the Hertford Loop Line at Stevenage, rather than have them continue through to Letchworth Garden City. Currently, services on the line terminate here at weekends, but on weekdays most were extended to Letchworth due to insufficient capacity to accommodate terminating trains at Stevenage. To help alleviate this problem, construction of an additional south-facing bay platform at Stevenage is currently in progress; this platform will allow Great Northern trains on the Hertford Loop Line to terminate here - similar to the arrangement at Welwyn Garden City - increasing capacity on both the Hertford Loop and the East Coast Main Line, and allow for an enhanced service frequency on both routes. Work on this new platform commenced during February 2019 and it is due for completion and commissioning in May 2020.\n\nIn May 2016 ORR gave the green light to a new open-access operator called East Coast Trains, which would operate services to Edinburgh Waverley via Stevenage, Newcastle and Morpeth. Services are planned to begin in 2021.\n"}

It is north of and on the main line it is situated between to the south and to the north. Its three-letter station code is DAR.\n\nThe station is well served, since it is an important stop for main line services, with trains being operated by London North Eastern Railway, CrossCountry and TransPennine Express, and it is the interchange for Northern services to Bishop Auckland, and Saltburn.\nDarlington is the location of the first commercial steam railway: the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The station building is a Grade II* listed Victorian structure and winner of the \"Large Station of the Year\" award in 2005.\n\nThe first railway to pass through the area now occupied by the station was built by the Stockton and Darlington Railway, who opened their mineral branch from \"Albert Hill Junction\" on their main line to Croft-on-Tees on 27 October 1829. This branch line was subsequently purchased by the Great North of England Railway a decade later to incorporate into their new main line from York which reached the town on 30 March 1841. A separate company, the \"Newcastle & Darlington Junction Railway\" continued the new main line northwards towards Ferryhill and Newcastle, opening its route three years later on 19 June 1844. This crossed the S&D at \"Parkgate Junction\" by means of a flat crossing which would in future years become something of an operational headache for the North Eastern Railway and LNER. The original \"Bank Top\" station where the two routes met was a modest affair, which was rebuilt in 1860 to accommodate the expanding levels of traffic on the main line. By the mid-1880s even this replacement structure was deemed inadequate and so the NER embarked on a major upgrade to facilities in the area. This included an ornate new station with an impressive three-span overall roof on the Bank Top site, new sidings and goods lines alongside it and a new connecting line from the south end of the station (\"Polam Junction\") to meet the original S&D line towards Middlesbrough at \"Oak Tree Junction\" near . These improvements were completed on 1 July 1887, when the old route west of Oak Tree closed to passengers (although it remained in use for freight until 1967). \n\nThe new station, with its broad island platform was designed by T.E. Harrison chief engineer, and William Bell, the architect of the North Eastern Railway. and cost £81,000 () to construct and soon became a busy interchange on the main East Coast route, thanks to its rail links to Richmond (opened in 1846), and (1862/5) and the Tees Valley Line to (1842) and (1861).\n\nThe lines to Penrith (closed in 1962), Barnard Castle (1964) and Richmond (1969) have now gone (along with the bays at the northern end of the station, now used for car parking), but the main line (electrified in 1991) and the Tees Valley route remain busy. It is also still possible to travel to Catterick Garrison and Richmond from here, by means of the Arriva North East-operated X26 and X27 buses (which have through National Rail ticketing arrangements). The same company also operated the \"Sky Express\" bus service to Durham Tees Valley Airport from the station, but this was withdrawn in January 2009 due to declining demand.\n\nIn the 1980s a replica set of Darlington Railway Station was built for an episode of Noel's Saturday Roadshow for the BBC.\n\n\n\nAs noted previous, the station is fully staffed; the ticket office is open throughout the week (06:00-20:00/21:00 weekdays, 06:30-19:45 Saturdays, 07:45-20:00 Sundays). There is a waiting room and a first class Lounge on the platform, with the lounge open between 06:00 and 20:00 each day (except Sundays, when it opens at 08:00). Self-service ticket machines are also provided for use outside the opening hours for the booking office and for collecting pre-paid tickets. Various retail outlets are located in the main buildings, including a coffee shop, grocers and newsagents. Vending machines, toilets, a photo booth, payphone and cash machines are also provided. Train running information is offered via digital CIS displays, announcements and timetable posters. Step-free access to all platforms is via ramps from the subway linking the platforms with the main entrance and car park.\n\nDarlington is well served by trains on the East Coast Main Line, with regular trains southbound to London King's Cross via and northbound to Newcastle and Edinburgh Waverley operated by London North Eastern Railway. Two trains per hour run south to London and north to Newcastle for much of the day with hourly services to Edinburgh Waverley. There are also several daily services to and also daily direct services to Stirling (two) and (one). \nDue to the introduction of the new ECML timetable on 22 May 2011, LNER only now provide one daily direct service each way between London King's Cross and Glasgow Central which calls at Darlington. The northbound service to Glasgow departs Darlington at 18:09 and the southbound service from Glasgow arrives into Darlington at 10:00.\n\nCrossCountry services between Edinburgh, Newcastle and Birmingham New Street and beyond to ( and and to Bristol Temple Meads, , and ) also call here twice each hour. Certain CrossCountry trains extend beyond Edinburgh to Glasgow Central, Dundee or Aberdeen.\n\nTransPennine Express run two trains per hour in each direction. Northbound; one service runs to Newcastle with a second extending to Edinburgh Waverley. Southbound; one service runs to Liverpool Lime Street via York, Leeds, Huddersfield, Manchester Victoria and Newton Le Willows with the second running to Manchester Airport via the Ordsall Chord. There is also one train early morning service to Redcar Central via Middlesbrough.\n\nNorthern run their Tees Valley line trains twice hourly to , Redcar and Saltburn (hourly on Sundays), whilst the branch has a service every hour (including Sundays). The company also operates two Sundays-only direct trains to/from Stockton and .\n\nDarlington railway station has five main platforms:\n\nAs part of the Tees Valley Metro, two new platforms were to be built on the eastern edge of the main station. There were to be a total of four trains per hour, to and Saltburn via the Tees Valley Line, and trains would not have to cross the East Coast Main Line when the new platforms would have been built. The Tees Valley Metro project was, however, cancelled.\n\nServices on the Bishop Auckland branch are also to be improved to hourly throughout the day, as part of the new Northern franchise (awarded to Arriva Rail North in December 2015) from the December 2017 timetable change.\n\nThe new high speed rail project in the UK, High Speed 2, is planned to run through Darlington once Phase 2b is complete and will run on the existing East Coast Main Line from York and Newcastle. Darlington Station will have two new platforms built for the HS2 trains on the Main Line, as the station is built just off the ECML to allow for freight services to pass through.\n\nHS2 Phase 2b is scheduled to start running in late 2033.\n\n"}

De Dodes Fjord and Sidebriksfjord are located north of the cape itself, and the Crimson Cliffs to the west.\n\nA chain of small coastal islands stretches between Cape York and Cape Melville to the east, the largest of which is Meteorite Island. The cape is located west-south-west of the Savissivik settlement on Meteorite Island. \n\nThere are not any permanent settlements near Cape York. There was one settlement, \"Perlernerit\", approximately 2 km (1 mi) northeast of the cape, but it is now permanently abandoned.\n\nThe cape was the one of many places visited in 1894 by Admiral Robert Peary during his second expedition to the Arctic. The area of Cape York was the site of discovery of the Cape York Meteorite. In the Greenlandic language, the name of the settlement \"Savissivik\" on the island close to the cape means 'place of meteorite iron' (\"savik\" = iron/knife), alluding to the numerous meteorites from 10,000 years ago that have been found in the area. The meteorite is estimated to have weighed 100 tonnes before it exploded. The iron from the meteorite attracted migrating Inuit from Arctic Canada.\n\n"}
{"id": "2320679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320679", "title": "Thomas Garrett", "text": "Thomas Garrett\n\nThomas Garrett (August 21, 1789January 25, 1871) was an American abolitionist and leader in the Underground Railroad movement before the American Civil War.\n\nGarrett was born into a prosperous landowning Quaker family on their homestead called \"Riverview Farm\" in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. When Thomas was a boy, one of the family's free black female servants was kidnapped by men who intended to sell her into slavery in the South. The Garretts rescued her, but this incident confirmed them in their abolitionist views, and all the sons would later become involved in abolitionism, and Thomas on a very large scale.\n\nWhen their father died in 1839, the original farm was split between Thomas' brothers' Issac and Edward, who renamed their farms \"Fernleaf Farm\" and \"Cleveland Farm\", but much is preserved today as Arlington Cemetery. Thomas's house, \"Thornfield\" built around 1800 and in which he lived until 1822, still stands today (as a private residence) in what is now the Drexel Hill neighborhood in Upper Darby Township.\n\nIn the schism between Orthodox and Hicksite Quakers, Garrett split with his Orthodox family and moved to Wilmington in the neighboring slave state of Delaware to strike out on his own and pursue his struggle against slavery. He established an iron and hardware business and made it prosper.\n\nIn 1827 Society of the State of Delaware was reorganized as the Delaware Abolition Society, whose officers and directors included Garrett, William Chandler, president John Wales, vice-president Edward Worrell, and others. Later that year, Wales and Garrett represented the group at the National Convention of Abolitionists. \n\nIn 1835, Garrett became a director of the new Wilmington Gas Company, which made gas \"made from rosin, at $7 per 1,000 cubic feet\" for lighting lamps.\nIn 1836, he, Chandler, Joseph Whitaker, and other partners invested and revived the Principio Furnace in Perryville, Maryland, near an important crossing of the Susquehanna River at the top of Chesapeake Bay.\n\nGarrett openly worked as a stationmaster on the Underground Railroad in Delaware, working with William Still in Philadelphia and John Hunn further down the Delmarva Peninsula. Among those he helped was the family of Henry Highland Garnet. Because he openly defied slave hunters as well as the slave system, Garrett had no need of secret rooms in his house at 227 Shipley Street. The authorities were aware of his activities, but he was never arrested.\n\nIn 1848, however, he and fellow Quaker John Hunn were sued in federal court for helping a family of eight slaves owned by two owners escape, although their lawyer colleague John Wales had managed to free them from imprisonment the previous year when a magistrate granted a writ of habeas corpus. However, the two slaveowners sued Hunn and Garrett. U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney presided at the trial in the New Castle Court House, and James A. Bayard, Jr. acted as prosecutor. Garrett and Hunn were found guilty of violating the Fugitive Slave Act by helping a family of slaves escape. As the \"architect\" of the escape, Garrett received a $4,500 fine, later reduced to $1500. According to Kathleen Lonsdale, referencing the American Friends Service Committee, \"The fine was so heavy that it left him financially ruined, yet Thomas Garrett stood up in Court and said \"Judge thou has left me not a dollar, but I wish to say to thee and to all in this courtroom that if anyone knows a fugitive who wants a shelter and a friend, send him to Thomas Garrett and he will befriend him\".\" A lien was put on his house until the fine was paid, and although Hunn ended up losing his house in a sheriff's sale, with the aid of friends Garrett continued in his iron and hardware business and helping runaway slaves to freedom. By 1855, traffic through Garrett's station had increased, and Sydney Howard Gay noted that in 1855-1856 nearly 50 fugitives whom Garrett had helped arrived in New York. \n\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, whom Garrett admired greatly, once visited him. However, they held different views regarding the opposition to slavery. Garrison was willing to be a martyr to the abolition of slavery and would not defend himself if attacked physically. Garrett, on the other hand, believed slavery could only be abolished through a civil war and, when attacked physically, defended himself by subduing his attackers.\n\nGarrett was also a friend and benefactor to the noted Underground Railroad Conductor Harriet Tubman, who passed through his station many times. In addition to lodging and meals, Garrett frequently provided her with money and shoes to continue her missions conducting runaways from slavery to freedom. Garrett also provided Tubman with the money and the means for her parents to escape from the South. (Both were free people at the time Tubman rescued them, but Tubman's father faced arrest for secreting runaway slaves in his cabin.)\nThe number of runaways Garrett assisted has sometimes been exaggerated. He said he \"only helped 2,700\" before the Civil War put an end to slavery.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, the free African Americans of Wilmington guarded Garrett's house. When the 15th Amendment passed, giving black men the right to vote, Wilmington's African Americans carried Garrett through the streets in an open barouche with a sign: \"Our Moses.\"\n\nGarrett died on January 25, 1871, at the age of 81. Freed blacks carried his bier on their shoulders to the Quaker Meeting House on West 4th Street in Wilmington, where he was interred.\n\nIn 1993, Wilmington named Tubman-Garrett Riverfront Park after the two Underground Railroad agents and friends. Pennsylvania and Delaware have also erected historical markers at sites associated with Garrett, in Drexel Hill and Wilmington, respectively. His house, Thornfield, remains private property near the historic marker on Garrett Road in Upper Darby.\n\n\n\n"}

The station is on one of the fastest parts of the East Coast Main Line. LNER and CrossCountry express services pass through the station at speeds of up to .\n\nIn 2014 the Wensleydale Railway opened a temporary station at . The heritage railway aims to run trains into the station from and eventually on the Settle–Carlisle line.\n\nThe station was opened by the Great North of England Railway on 30 March 1841. Eleven years later the Leeds Northern Railway's line from Leeds to Stockton passed through the town, but did not initially connect with the main line. Instead trains called at nearby \"Northallerton Town\" station near where it passed beneath the line to Darlington. By 1854 the GNoE and the LN had become part of the North Eastern Railway which began running through trains on the LN route via Thirsk. These rejoined the line towards Eaglescliffe ona new link from the main line at High Junction that opened in 1856. The original LN route southwards towards Melmerby was then operated as a branch line until 1901, when the NER connected it to the main line via another junction at the southern end of the station and used it as the primary route from West Yorkshire to Teesside.\n\nThe Wensleydale branch line to , Leyburn and opened in stages between 1848 and 1878. It joined the main line immediately north of the station and its trains used a bay at the northern end of the northbound island platform. Passenger trains on the branch were withdrawn from 26 April 1954, although it remains open for occasional M.o.D trains to and heritage trains operated by the Wensleydale Railway. The old down passenger loop platform and Hawes bay were removed in the early 1970s and there is no direct route to the branch from the station as its junction faces north; trains must access it by means of a reversing siding off the northbound main line. The defunct south to west curve will need to be reinstated and a new platform constructed before Wensleydale trains can run to and from the station. The link to Leeming Bar was by bus until late 2014 until a temporary terminus was constructed approximately one mile (1.6 km) away.\n\nServices were withdrawn on the line towards Ripon on 6 March 1967, after the route was earmarked for closure in the Beeching Report. The line north-eastwards towards Stockton had lost its local passenger services by this time, but it was retained for freight traffic to and from Teesside and occasional longer distance passenger trains. It now carries a regular service to and from Middlesbrough.\n\n\nThe station is staffed, its ticket hall opens from 05:30 each day (except Sundays, when it opens at 08:45) until 20:00. Self-service ticket machines are available for the collecting advance purchase/pre-paid tickets. Toilets and a newsagents are provided on the concourse, along with heated waiting rooms on both platforms. Train running information is offered via digital CIS displays, timetable posters, customer help points and automated announcements. Step-free access is available to both platforms via ramps from the subway.\n\nTransPennine Express is the main train operator at the station: on weekdays and Saturdays the company serves Northallerton with three trains an hour each way. In the southbound direction, trains generally run to via , and ; of the three hourly services, two continue to (via ) and one runs further to .

All are activated when freight trains to and from Teesside pass through and Low Gates is activated by passenger train to and from Middlesbrough. Low Gates, on the road to Darlington, causes most traffic congestion as the barriers are down for 30 minutes in each hour. Freight trains are held at the red signal but passenger trains leave the station because the passenger lines cross the freight avoiding line and passenger trains have priority. Freight trains block Low Gates crossing until they are given a green light to proceed. Motorists have launched a petition to have a study into how the problem could be managed.\n\nElectrification of the railway through the station was carried out by British Rail.\n\nOn 29 November 1979, a Kings Cross to Edinburgh Service (1S28) was derailed just south of the station. The train completely left the tracks, but stayed upright and came to a halt 550 metres north of where it hit the trailing points that caused the derailment. Although the complement of passengers was in excess of 440, only one person was kept in hospital overnight.\n\nThe leading power car of the High Speed Train (E43110) had a seized front axle because of a gearbox failure and confusion over maintenance schedules and it caused an out of gauge wheelset that derailed on the points.\n\nThe city was previously served by Ripon railway station on the Leeds–Northallerton line that ran between Leeds and Northallerton. It was once part of the North Eastern Railway and then LNER.\n\nThe Ripon line was closed to passengers on 6 March 1967 and to freight on 5 September 1969 as part of the wider Beeching Axe, despite a vigorous campaign by local campaigners, including the city's MP. Today much of the route of the line through the city is now a relief road and although the former station still stands, it is now surrounded by a new housing development. The issue remains a significant one in local politics and there are movements wanting to restore the line. Reports suggest the reopening of a line between Ripon railway station and Harrogate railway station would be economically viable, costing £40 million and could initially attract 1,200 passengers a day, rising to 2,700. Campaigners call on MPs to restore Ripon railway link.\n\n\n"}

The maximum-security facility is used to hold detainees in solitary confinement, as well as for interrogations by the military.\n\nHoused here are also detainees scheduled for Military Commissions, and those considered \"high value detainees\" by the Defense Department. In addition, detainees are brought here for private consultation with their attorneys.\n\nAs of May 2011, most of the detainees at Camp Echo were so-called \"detainees of interest.\" That month, one of them, Inayatullah (also known as Haji Naseem, ISN 10028) was found dead in the small recreation yard outside his cell at approximately 3:50 am. According to Army investigators, Naseem was allowed to go back and forth to the recreation yard without having the door to his cell locked. In the middle of the night, guards found Naseem hanging from a pole in the fence of the recreation yard, in a noose improvised from one of his bedsheets. Guards were on record as complaining to their superiors about \"special privileges\" allotted the prisoners at Camp Echo. Naseem was perhaps special because of his psychiatric history and previous suicide attempts, or possibly was special (\"of interest\") because he was, at least some of the time, cooperating with interrogators.\n\nCamp Echo consists of separate one-story buildings, each a cell divided into two rooms by mesh grates. This division allows lawyers to consult with detainees in the area of their cells. Military officials also use the facilities to interrogate detainees, shackling them to the floor. The eight feet by ten feet (2.4 m by 3 m) concrete buildings have narrow, slotted translucent plastic in the doors but no real windows; they are air-conditioned and heated. The cell side contains a toilet and a cot. The visitor side contains a table and chairs.\n\nMartin Mubanga, a British resident who was released without charges in January 2005 after being held for nearly three years, described being subjected to extremes of heat and cold during interrogation, which during one period happened on a daily basis. He and other former prisoners have described other abuses and torture at the hands of American interrogators.\n\nOutside visitors to Camp Echo, such as attorneys for detainees, must pass through several guarded checkpoint gates. The camp is surrounded by high razor wire fences and is shrouded behind a thick green mesh. Walkways are drawn in the crushed white rock on the ground of the camp, and visitors are instructed to stay within these boundaries.\n\nCamp Echo is under 24-hour guard by U.S. military police. Air patrol is provided by the Federal Air Marshals, and coastal protection is provided by the U.S. Coast Guard, both of which are part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nCamp Delta is composed of detention camps 1, 2, 3, 4. Camp Echo is near it.\n\nAccording to an article by Carol Rosenberg, published in \"The New York Times\", on September 17, 2019, Camp Echo had been a CIA black site, until 2004. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2320693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320693", "title": "WKBF-TV", "text": "WKBF-TV\n\nWKBF-TV, UHF analog channel 61, was an independent television station licensed to Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The station was owned as a joint venture between Kaiser Broadcasting, Frank V. Mavec and Associates and, later, Field Communications (the latter owned a minority stake in the station from 1972 to 1975). WKBF is perhaps the least remembered for its position in television history, although many nationally recognized broadcast professionals began their career at the station. WKBF-TV's studios were located on St. Clair Avenue in Euclid. Its microwave studio-transmitter link (STL) was assigned the microwave license of KZM-32.\n\nAs the newest member of the Kaiser Broadcasting chain of independent stations (which included WKBD-TV in Detroit, WKBS-TV (frequency now occupied by WGTW-TV) in Philadelphia, WKBG-TV (now WLVI) in Boston, WFLD-TV in Chicago, KBHK-TV (now known as KBCW) in San Francisco, and KBSC-TV (now KVEA) in Los Angeles), WKBF-TV first signed on the air on January 19, 1968; when the station began operation, its first day of broadcast was delayed due to one of the worst snowstorms to hit the area that winter.\n\nWKBF was the first commercial UHF television station to sign on the air in Cuyahoga County, and it paved the way for other commercial UHF stations that would debut later, such as WUAB (channel 43, with whom it later merged) and WOIO (channel 19). The first video footage transmitted on the station was a simple sentence on a hand-lettered message board reading, \"We made it Cleveland\", accompanied by a 1,000 hertz tone (normally used for system calibration).\nIn a bold move for that point in time, WKBF attempted to bring in unique programs to the Greater Cleveland television market in order to gain profitability. In another ahead-of-its-time programming move, news director Matt Quinn, began one of the first 10 p.m. newscasts on the Eastern United States, simply called \"The 10 O'Clock News\", which aired an hour earlier than the late evening newscasts on the market's network-affiliated stations. The program lasted until its cancellation in November 1970, with its anchor, John Herrington, later moving to WKYC (channel 3), where he enjoyed a long career before passing away in 2007.\n\nThe station was also Northeastern Ohio's first affiliate of the Muscular Dystrophy Association's \"Love Network\", broadcasting the annual Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon, within which the local inserts were hosted by notable children's host Linn Sheldon (famous for \"The Barnaby Show\"). A soon-to-be famous children's program called \"Captain Cleveland\" also aired on WKBF, even though the actual Captain was never actually seen on-camera by viewers. In a sort of local nod to Charlie McCarthy and Edgar Bergen, the characters on the show included John, played by local Cleveland ventriloquist John Slowey, and his puppet buddy Clem, who performed on the station from 1969 to 1974.\n\nOther programming on WKBF included a late-night weekend horror movie showcase hosted by Ron Sweed, whose on-air character was named \"The Ghoul\". The Ghoul character was essentially a beatnik vampire, outfitted in a fright wig, goatee, lab coat, and a pair of sunglasses with one lens missing. It was patterned after the Ghoulardi character that was created by Ernie Anderson (with his permission), who was later to become the voice of the ABC network in the 1970s. While Anderson had no interest in doing so, he granted Sweed permission to don the costume. As WJW owned the rights to the name \"Ghoulardi\", the younger performer adopted the name \"The Ghoul.\" Although WKBF has long since passed into broadcasting history, Sweed continued to make personal appearances on a fee-for-service basis in this guise until very late in life. WKBF also featured sports programming such as game telecasts from the World Football League and Cincinnati Royals NBA basketball, and harness racing.\n\nAlthough it had a large array of local programming, the most popular and most profitable program on WKBF were syndicated reruns of the original \"\". It was well known that WKBF had rebroadcast the entire 79-episode original series in the exact order of play that had been originally shown on NBC when it aired on that network, and had also paid out of its own pocket for the special high-contrast black-and-white prints of the show in order to do so. In another bold move for the times, the show also ran in its original length, without additional editing for commercials.\n\nThe station was also one of only two commercial independent stations in the immediate Cleveland area back in the early 1970s, along with WUAB. A third UHF station also existed – non-commercial educational station WVIZ (channel 25). Other UHF stations in the market, with varying coverage, included ABC affiliate WAKR-TV in Akron (channel 23, now Ion Television station WVPX-TV) and WJAN-TV in Canton (channel 17, now TBN station WDLI-TV).\n\nBy 1973, Kaiser Broadcasting had sold a 22.5% share of WKBF to Field Communications, but Kaiser retained a majority share of the station, even though two years later in April 1975, WUAB owner United Artists sold another partial stake in that station to the Kaiser/Field group, the station continued to draw its share of viewers. However, in 1975, because FCC rules at the time did not allow for ownership of more than one station in any market by the same owner or group owner, Kaiser/Field opted to shut down WKBF. Kaiser then chose to augment the programming of sister station WUAB with the best content from WKBF after the station went dark. Even though Kaiser, partnered (as a minority shareholder) with United Artists operations in the spring of 1975 after shutting down WKBF, at no time did WUAB operate under full or partial Kaiser ownership.\n\nThe station's final scheduled program on April 25, 1975 was an episode of \"Perry Mason\"; this was followed by highlights of the previous seven years of the station's existence; and then by station vice president and general manager Alan B. Bennett thanking the community for its support, attributing Kaiser's decision to fold the WKBF operation into WUAB as a result of \"static market growth\" along with \"the creation of a second (commercial UHF) station in less than a year\". Despite merging WKBF-TV into WUAB-TV, the channel 61 license was fully returned to the FCC, which closed the opportunity to transfer the license to another owner.\n\nRumors abounded concerning potential companies that could file for the Channel 61 license in Cleveland, yet none came forward right away. In 1980, Balaban Communications purchased a new, separate license using the UHF channel 61 allocation. The company signed on the new station later that year under the call letters WCLQ-TV (which would later change to WQHS-TV). The station now operates as an owned-and-operated station of Spanish-language network, Univision, as WQHS-DT.\n\n \n"}

It is down the line from and is situated between to the south and to the north.\n\nIt is the most northerly railway station in England, being less than three miles from the border with Scotland. The station, with its long single island platform, lies immediately to the north of the Royal Border Bridge.\n\nIn 1847, the Great Hall of Berwick Castle had to be demolished to make way for the new station (the former West Wall of the castle still marks the boundary of the now-defunct station goods yard), which opened the following year. This replaced an initial structure erected by the North British Railway, whose line from the north first reached the town in 1846. The \"Newcastle and Berwick Railway\" meanwhile reached the southern bank of the River Tweed in March 1847, but it was another eighteen months before a temporary viaduct across the river was commissioned to allow through running between Edinburgh and Newcastle. This in turn was replaced by the current Royal Border Bridge in July 1850. The station was rebuilt by the London and North Eastern Railway in 1927 and the buildings are Grade-II listed.\n\nThe station was also at one time served by local stopping trains between Newcastle and Edinburgh and the branch line from Newtown St Boswells via Kelso (which joined the main line at Tweedmouth, on the other side of the river) from 1851 until closure in 1964.\n\nFor approximately 5 months in 1979, this was the terminus for services from London King's Cross after the East Coast Main Line was blocked by the collapse of Penmanshiel Tunnel.

It is located on the East Coast Main Line and is a two platform station. The main platform (One) is located on a loop adjacent to the main through lines. The second platform is on the main northbound line which has officially operated trains stopping there since 15 December 2019. It is from and from . Prior to December 2019, the line on which the main platform is located was bi-directional (meaning that trains travelling to/from London or Edinburgh Waverley had to take it in turns to use the station if they were scheduled to stop there). With all Northbound services now using the second platform and no longer using the main platform loop (with the exception of the 0700 Cross Country to Glasgow and all terminating Scotrail Services from Edinburgh), this now leaves Syston station in Leicester as the only rare example of a single platformed main line railway station used on a major route.\n\nThe station, which was first opened by the North British Railway in June 1846, used to have two platforms and an overall roof. Both features no longer exist - the northbound platform loop line was taken out of use and lifted in the early 1970s, whilst the platform itself and the station roof were both removed during the modernisation and electrification by British Rail of the northern end of the East Coast Main Line in 1987-88.\n\nFor approximately five months in 1979, this was the terminal station for a shuttle service to Edinburgh Waverley. The shuttle service was provided after the East Coast Main Line was blocked due to the collapse of Penmanshiel Tunnel. Buses linked Dunbar with Berwick-upon-Tweed, from where rail services to London King's Cross resumed.\n\n\nThe station is fully staffed, with the ticket office open throughout the week (Monday - Friday 05:55 - 21:30, Saturday 06:25 - 20:40 and Sunday 11:15 - 21:30). Self-service ticket machines are also provided for use outside these times and for collecting pre-paid tickets. There are toilets, a payphone and vending machines on the concourse. Train running information is provided by manual announcements, digital CIS displays, a customer help point and timetable posters. Level access is available from the entrance and concourse to the platform.\n\nInfrastructure operator Network Rail and East Lothian council have engaged in discussions to reinstate a second platform. This would be located on the main lines to the south of the present station and would need a new bridge constructing to link it to the existing station building and platform. In December 2018, Network Rail announced (via press release) that Amco has been appointed the contractors in the construction of the second platform which started in Summer 2019 and have the works completed by early 2020. However, the works completed and the new platform opened in December 2019.\n\nThe station is served by Abellio ScotRail, CrossCountry, London North Eastern Railway and TransPennine Express. It was managed by the InterCity East Coast franchise holder until June 2015 when responsibility was transferred from Virgin Trains East Coast to Abellio ScotRail.\n\nThe station is served mainly by CrossCountry trains on the to Edinburgh route with projections to/from (2 Services Monday-Saturday and 1 on Sundays), (1 service per day) or (07:00 service weekdays) in the north and (1 service per day Monday-Saturday with an occasional Sunday) in the south. These trains serve Dunbar at roughly two-hourly intervals throughout the day. Some London North Eastern Railway services between London King's Cross/Leeds and Edinburgh Waverley call at Dunbar.\n\nAbellio ScotRail also provides some Monday to Saturday services to Edinburgh. The weekday ScotRail services were introduced in the May 2010 timetable (marking the first time in 20 years since Scottish local services used Dunbar). A year later in May 2011, all ScotRail services between Dunbar and Edinburgh introduced a one intermediate stop at Musselburgh to allow the connection of Dunbar students to Queen Margaret University. From the beginning of the December 2011 timetable, a late Saturday night service to Dunbar from Edinburgh was introduced. The Saturday daytime services were introduced in the December 2012 timetable. The Abellio ScotRail services enhance Dunbar every two hours during the day making the daytime services hourly on Mondays-Saturdays. Abellio ScotRail does not serve Dunbar on Sundays. Train services on Sundays are two hourly throughout the day except for the evenings where these services are hourly until mid/late evening.\n\nFrom December 2019, one southbound TransPennine Express service began to call at Dunbar.\n\n\n"}

One is a superheroine, the other a superhero. Michiko \"Mickey\" Musashi debuted in \"New Warriors\" #28 (Oct 1992) and her ally Michael \"Mike\" Jeffries in \"New Warriors\" #33.\n\nThe Torpedo armor was a creation of the Dire Wraiths, their attempt to counter the cybernetic armor of the Spaceknights. They employed a human scientist to develop it, combining both Wraith and human technology. It had collapsible turbines mounted around the wrists and ankles, allowing the user to fly and fire powerful blasts of air. Upon discovering that the suit was going to be used for criminal purposes, its inventor stole it but died while escaping, and he gave it to the first person he stumbled onto, a man called Brock Jones, who used it to battle crime as the superhero the Torpedo.\n\nHowever, Jones eventually decided to hide himself and his family from the people seeking the armor, and went to live in the town of Clairton, West Virginia, where he encountered Rom the Spaceknight and learned about the Wraiths. Jones agreed to help Rom protect the town from the Wraiths, and Rom altered the costume so its lenses would allow the user to see a Dire Wraith's true form.\n\nHowever, Jones was eventually found and killed by the Wraiths anyway. Some of Jones' effects were passed on to his relative Phillip Jeffries, whose son Michael found the armor and gave it to his friend Michiko so she could use it as a Halloween costume. When Michiko donned the armor, it began broadcasting on a wavelength that allowed human scientists from the lab that developed the armor to track it and they attacked Michiko and Mike at a college costume party, where Michiko discovered the suit's abilities and fought off her attackers.\n\nMickey and Mike began sharing the armor, Mike wishing to be a superhero, while Mickey used it to travel the world. Although she considered heroism as a \"ridiculous calling\", Mickey did not wish to see innocent people hurt when she could have prevented it. This is one of the reasons which got her mixed up with the New Warriors: after a gang of weapon smugglers under the command of the mercenary Sea Urchin involved an innocent in their dealings, she set out to stop them and ran into the team, who were also tailing the criminals. Mickey helped the Warriors to bring them down, capturing the Sea Urchin.\n\nMike encountered the Warriors as Turbo when Darkling put Manhattan under siege with the energies of the Darkforce Dimension, and the two Turbos were attacked by the Air Force when they trained with Nova. Mickey became a reserve Warrior, helping rescue the team twice alongside other back-up heroes, before being offered a full-time membership by the team. Mickey continued to share the armor with Mike, but often had to borrow it for missions with the Warriors.\n\nOn one mission, the Warriors fought Volx, the queen of the Dire Wraiths, who recognized the Torpedo armor and desired it for the power-boost it would give her. She tracked the armor to Mike and killed him, absorbing his memories. Posing as Mike, she tricked the Warriors into giving her the armor, which she used in a plot to depower Earth's superhuman population, before she was ultimately killed by Night Thrasher. Mickey pledged to be the sort of hero that Mike wanted to be in order to honor him.\n\nMickey later met and fell in love with a young man named Dalton Beck, who unfortunately turned out to be Firestrike, a member of the armored criminal team Heavy Mettle. When the Warriors clashed with Heavy Mettle, Firestrike turned on his allies and employer to protect Turbo. Beck was subsequently put in the Federal Witness Protection Program, preventing the two of them from continuing their relationship.\n\nDeciding that she would do more good with her education in journalism than adventuring, Mickey retired the Torpedo armor. With the help of Phil Urich, she got a job at the Los Angeles Times newspaper (though she would later quit this job to relocate to New York for reasons unexplained). She founded the group called Excelsior, a support group for retired teenage superheroes; their lives were briefly the focus of the short-lived \"Loners\" miniseries.\n\nWithin the first issue of \"Loners\"; Mickey was talking with Phil regarding Julie Power's recent lapse in using her flying powers. And in the second issue, Mickey was going on a date with Chris Powell after their latest support group meeting.\n\nWithin the third issue; Mickey learns about Chris, Mattie and Johnny's involvement about the MGH Ring and the events leading to where Julie was stabbed by Hollow (originally known as Penance from Generation X). Mickey also prevented Hollow's recapture by the group responsible for her imprisonment by talking to their leader - a CEO named Fuyumi Fujiwaka - in she and Mickey's 'native' Japanese language - though Mickey is an American citizen by birth and why she would refer to the Japanese language as her 'native' tongue is not addressed. The fourth issue has Mickey talking with Chris about her concerns with Mattie within the support group, as well as making up for the recent tensions between them afterwards.\n\nWithin the fifth issue; Mickey was almost strangled by Nekra when she was saved by a mysterious girl who called herself \"Namie\". And although she was terrified of dying (since she was not wearing the Turbo suit at the time); Mickey was also angered by the facts that Julie revealed the truth that she was not a registered hero and that Chris refused to remove the Darkhawk amulet from himself. She was also surprised to learn that Phil harbored feelings for her and witnessing his attack on Chris, in which he grabbed the amulet and transformed into an alternate version of Darkhawk.\n\nAlongside Julie and the other members of the Loners, Mickey is eventually inducted into the Avengers Academy by Hawkeye after the school moves into the former headquarters of the West Coast Avengers.\n\nMickey Mushashi and Mike Jeffries are both normal humans with no superhuman powers. As Turbo, they both wear a helmet and battle suit previously worn by the Torpedo, and invented by the second Torpedo, Michael Stivak, employing both Earth and Dire Wraith technology.\n\nThe Torpedo battle suit is commanded via cybernetic circuitry built into the cowl/headpiece and bonds to its wearer allowing for greater degrees of control depending on the wearer's individual body chemistry compatibility and skill in manipulating the cybernetic bond, determined by the degree to which his or her brain pattern interacts with its technology. Brock Jones, the suit's first heroic user and the third Torpedo, had a sufficient degree of compatibility and skill to access most functions of the suit. Mickey, however, possesses a far greater natural compatibility and this, combined with her greater length of time using the suit, has enabled her to access functions that Brock could not, such as the suit's limited ability to reconfigure itself cosmetically according to the wearer's wishes. The helmet and suit are both useless without one another.\n\nThe Torpedo battle suit allows Mickey to fly at speeds up to, and including, supersonic levels; the exact top speed of the armor has yet to be classified. While in flight, the suit generates a low-level force field to protect her from the adverse physical stress of moving at such speeds; it also provides a great deal of durability for combat applications, and can disperse radiation directed against it.\n\nUsing the small nuclear-powered turbines built into the gauntlets and boots of the suit, Mickey is able to project a pulsed concussive force blast nicknamed a \"Turbo Punch\" which is essentially a jet-powered punch, enabling her to strike opponents or objects with a tremendous amount of force. Using a dual-fisted double Turbo Punch delivers force equal to a full-powered punch from a superhuman with Class 100 strength. The wearer can regulate these hyper-punches so as to strike a person without causing serious injury. The wearer can also use these turbines to create blasts of high-speed air, projecting both wide wind gusts and narrow gusts and simulating concussive force.\n\nAssisted by the power of the turbo jets, the suit is capable of providing the wearer with superhuman strength, as well. The level of superhuman strength conferred is again based on the wearer's compatibility with the suit and familiarity with its functions. Brock Jones was capable of lifting (pressing) approximately 1 ton; Mickey is able to optimally lift (press) 20 tons.\n\nBuilt into the suit's visor is a device able to detect Dire Wraiths (a divergent branch of the Skrulls), no matter what form they take, that was given to Brock Jones by Rom the Spaceknight in order to better protect the town of Clairton, West Virginia during the Wraiths' attempted conquest of the Earth. It is possible that it may be able to detect Skrulls, as well.\n\nMickey appears as a member of the Wolfpack; along with Speedball, Rage, Zero-G, Lightspeed and Darkhawk.\n\n"}

Population: 21,000 (1968).\n\nA settlement called Alexandrovskaya on the present site of the town was first recorded in 1862. In 1869, an agricultural farm was established there, which later grew into the village of Alexandrovka. At the time, it was known as among Japanese.\n\nIn 1881, a military post was established and became known as Alexandrovsky. The outpost served as the administrative center for managing \"katorga\", prisons, exile settlements, and the whole island until the October Revolution. Anton Chekhov lived here in 1890 while gathering material for his book \"The Sakhalin Island\".\n\nTown status was granted to Alexandrovsky in 1917. During the Russian Civil War, the town was under the control of Admiral Alexander Kolchak in 1918–1920, before being occupied by the Japanese until 1925. It was known as \"Street of Port Alexander\" during Japanese occupation between 1918 and 1925.\n\nIn 1926, the town was renamed Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky to distinguish it from other places of the same name.\n\nAlexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky was the administrative center of Sakhalin Oblast between 1932 and 1947. It was also known as the coal mining center of the island during Soviet times.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky serves as the administrative center of Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky District and is subordinated to it. As a municipal division, the town of Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky and thirteen rural localities of Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky District are incorporated as Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky Urban Okrug.\n\nThe economy of Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky is mainly reliant on its harbor, the oldest and previously most important on Sakhalin, and the mining of black coal in the local area.\n\nAlexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification \"Dfb\") with short mild to warm summers and long, cold winters.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2320741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320741", "title": "Diplomatic correspondence", "text": "Diplomatic correspondence\n\nDiplomatic correspondence is correspondence between one state and another and is usually of a formal character. It follows several widely observed customs and style in composition, substance, presentation, and delivery and can generally be categorized into letters and notes.\n\nLetters are correspondence between heads of state, typically used for the appointment and recall of ambassadors; for the announcement of the death of a sovereign or an accession to the throne; or for expressions of congratulations or condolence. \n\nLetters between two monarchs of equal rank will typically begin with the salutation \"Sir My Brother\" (or \"Madame My Sister\", in the case of a female monarch) and close with the valediction \"Your Good Brother\" (or Sister, in the case of a female monarch). In the case where one monarch is of inferior rank to the other (for instance, if the Grand Duke of Luxembourg were to correspond with the Queen of the United Kingdom), the inferior monarch will use the salutation \"Sire\" (or \"Madame\"), while the superior monarch may refer to the other as \"Cousin\" instead of \"Brother\". If either the sender or the recipient is the head-of-state of a republic, letters may begin with the salutation \"My Great and Good Friend\" and close with the valediction \"Your Good Friend\"; beneath the signature line will be inscribed \"To Our Great and Good Friend [Name and Title of Recipient]\".\n\nA letter of credence (\"lettres de créance\") is the instrument by which a head of state appoints (\"accredits\") ambassadors to foreign countries. Also known as credentials, the letter closes with a phrase \"asking that credit may be given to all that the ambassador may say in the name of his sovereign or Government.\" The credentials are presented personally to the receiving country's head of state or viceroy in a formal ceremony. Letters of credence are worded carefully, as the sending or acceptance of a letter implies diplomatic recognition of the other government. Letters of credence date to the thirteenth century.\n\nA letter of recall is formal correspondence from one head-of-state notifying a second head-of-state that he or she is recalling his state's ambassador.\n\nIn cases where an envoy is entrusted with unusually extensive tasks that would not be covered by an ordinary permanent legation (such as the negotiation of a special treaty or convention, or representation at a diplomatic congress), an envoy may be given full powers (\"pleins pouvoirs\") \"in letters patent signed by the head of the State\" designing \"either limited or unlimited full powers, according to the requirements of the case.\"\n\nAccording to \"Satow's Diplomatic Practice\", the bestowal of full powers traces its history to the Roman \"plena potestas\"; its purpose was to be able to dispense, as far as possible, with the long delays needed in earlier times for referring problems back to higher authority. Their use at the present day is a formal recognition of the necessity of absolute confidence in the authority and standing of the negotiator.\n\nA \"note verbale\" () is a formal form of note and is so named by originally representing a formal record of information delivered orally. It is less formal than a note (also called a letter of protest) but more formal than an aide-mémoire. A \"note verbale\" can also be referred to as a third person note (TPN). Notes verbale are written in the third person and printed on official letterhead; they are typically sealed with an embosser or, in some cases, a stamp. All notes verbale begin with a formal salutation, typically:\n\nNotes verbales will also close with a formal valediction, typically:\n\nNotes verbales composed by the British Foreign Office are written on blue paper.\n\nUkrainian protest of the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation.\nThe Ukrainian party categorically denies extension of sovereignty of the Russian Federation on Ukrainian territory, and reserves the right to exercise measures in accordance with international law and the laws of Ukraine.\n\nA collective note is a letter delivered from multiple states to a single recipient state. It is always written in the third person. The collective note has been a rarely used form of diplomatic communication due to the difficulty in obtaining agreements among multiple states to the exact wording of a letter.\n\nAn identic note is a letter delivered from a single state to multiple recipient states. Examples include the identic note sent by Thomas Jefferson regarding action against the Barbary Pirates and that from the United States to China and the Soviet Union in 1929. In it, the United States called on the other two powers to resolve their differences over the Eastern China Railway peacefully.\n\nA \"bout de papier\" (speaking note) may be presented by a visiting official when meeting with an official from another state at the conclusion of the meeting. Prepared in advance, it contains a short summary of the main points addressed by the visiting official during the meeting and, firstly, serves as a memory aid for the visiting official when speaking. It, secondly, removes ambiguity about the subject of the meeting occasioned by verbal miscues by the visiting official. Bouts de papier are always presented without credit or attribution so as to preserve the confidentiality of the meeting in case the document is later disclosed.\n\nA \"démarche\" (non-paper) is considered less formal than the already informal bout de papier. Officially described as \"a request or intercession with a foreign official\" it is a written request that is presented without attribution from the composing state and is, therefore, delivered in-person.\n\nSimilar to a démarche, an \"aide-mémoire\" is a proposed agreement or negotiating text circulated informally among multiple states for discussion without committing the originating delegation's country to the contents. It has no identified source, title, or attribution and no standing in the relationship involved.\n\nStandard diplomatic protocol varies from country to country, but generally requires clear yet concise translation between both parties.\n\nThe earliest forms of diplomatic correspondence were, out of necessity, written in Latin, Latin being a common language among states of a linguistically diverse Europe. By the early 19th century French had firmly supplanted Latin as the language of diplomacy; on one occasion, in 1817, the British attempted to correspond with the Austrian Imperial Court in English, prompting Klemens von Metternich to threaten retaliatory correspondence in Weanarisch. In modern times, French has largely been replaced by English as a diplomatic lingua franca in correspondence between two states that do not share a common tongue.\n\nStates may sometimes reject diplomatic correspondence addressed to them by returning the original copy to the sending state. This is done as a rebuff of the contents of the correspondence and is typically reserved for cases where the receiving state feels the language used by the sending state is rude, or the subject matter represents an inappropriate intercession into the receiving state's internal affairs.\n\n"}

{"id": "2320755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320755", "title": "Political decoy", "text": "Political decoy\n\nA political decoy is a person employed to impersonate a politician, to draw attention away from the real person or to take risks on that person's behalf. This can also apply to military figures, or civilians impersonated for political or espionage purposes.\n\nThe political decoy is an individual who has been selected because of strong physical resemblance to the person being impersonated. This resemblance can be strengthened by plastic surgery. Often, such decoys are trained to speak and behave like the \"target\".\n\nThe practice of decoying is essentially little different from the profession of celebrity lookalike, in which people mimic famous entertainers whom they resemble. The only difference is that the \"lookalike\" presents an acknowledged artifice. The decoy must conceal his or her imposture from the \"audience\".\n\nIn 2001, Poland hosted the first-ever doppelganger convention, to which lookalikes from across the country turned up, offering the unlikely spectacle of Joseph Stalin hobnobbing with Elizabeth Taylor. Nearly all the doppelgangers at the event had complemented their resemblance to a famous person by costume.\n\nSome \"lookalikes\" actually stop mimicking their targets and start pretending to \"be\" them. Comedian Robin Williams was one such victim, whose identity was allegedly \"stolen\" by professional look-alike Michael Clayton, for financial reasons.\n\nSince deception is the whole purpose of employing a political decoy, there are many instances of alleged decoying which remain uncertain.\n\nJoe R. Reeder, an undersecretary for the U.S. Army from 1993 to 1997, has gone on record with claims that a number of figures around the world have or have had decoys, including Manuel Noriega, Raoul Cédras, Enver Hoxha, Fidel Castro, George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden.\n\nOf Noriega's alleged four decoys, Reeder said, \"They were good. They practiced his gait, his manner of speech and his modus operandi – what he did during the day and night.\"\n\nInformation on these instances of decoying is hard to come by. And falsely accusing an enemy of using a decoy can be an effective psychological operations tactic (making an enemy seem like a coward who dare not appear in person, for example).\n\nThis means that the confusion generated by the existence of real decoys is deepened by counterclaims of decoys where there may be none.\n\nThe case of Osama bin Laden is instructive. In the absence of confirmed sightings of the terrorist figurehead, many sources openly speculated that videotaped messages from bin Laden were in fact recordings of a double - either as part of a \"frame-up\" operation, or as part of a strategy of deception on bin Laden's part.\n\nSpeculation in such situations is naturally liable to run high. For the purposes of this entry, only well-documented allegations or confirmed cases of political decoying are discussed. Instances which are still under debate will have section headings below in quotes.\n\nSoldier M. E. Clifton James successfully impersonated General Bernard Montgomery (\"Monty\") for intelligence purposes during World War II.\nIn 1940, James acted in an Army production called \"When Knights Were Bold\" and his photograph appeared in an Army newspaper with a remark about how much he resembled General Montgomery.\n\nAs a result, he was approached by actor David Niven in May 1944. Niven, then a Colonel in the Army Kinematograph Section, told James he was wanted to impersonate \"Monty\", as this would allow Montgomery to be somewhere else, thus confusing the Germans.\n\nJames had to learn Montgomery's gestures, mannerisms, gait and voice and had to give up smoking.\n\nBecause James had lost his right-hand middle finger in the First World War, a realistic replacement was made.\n\nEven his wife had to be deceived and was both kept in the dark and sent back to Leicester. Once he was trained, his trip as \"Monty\" was to Gibraltar and from there to Algiers. \"Monty's\" presence succeeded in confusing the Germans in regard to the invasion plans.\n\nJames was later the subject of a biopic called \"I Was Monty's Double\" starring James himself in the double role as Monty and himself.\n\nThe second (and less famous) \"Monty's Double\", Keith Deamer Banwell, was serving with the land-based Long Range Desert Group.\n\nBanwell was captured in a raid on Tobruk, but with a friend managed to steal a German vehicle and escape. During a subsequent raid on Crete he was taken prisoner at Heraklion and put under the personal supervision of former world heavyweight boxing champion Max Schmeling, who was serving in the German Army.\n\nBanwell and a few of his comrades managed to slip away from their captors and then acquired an assault landing craft. With the help of some Cretan fishermen they made their getaway, but the craft ran out of fuel and drifted for nine days before reaching the North African coast. The privations of this voyage put Banwell in hospital for 12 weeks.\n\nWhen he had recovered, someone noticed that he bore a resemblance to General Montgomery. It was decided that he participate in deception ploys, and so Banwell was sent to Cairo to meet Montgomery, given the appropriate clothing, insignia and General's badges and sent on trips around the Middle East to confuse enemy spies.\n\nHowever, as he was considerably taller than Montgomery, he was told that on no account should he get out of the car. Banwell, finding the assignment boring, sought a return to the infantry.\n\nAdolf Hitler is known to have employed at least one double, Gustav Weler. British surgeon and historical writer W. Hugh Thomas reported in his 1996 book \"Doppelgangers\" that Gustav Weler was found alive after the war and that Allied troops interviewed Weler following Hitler's death.\n\nHugh Thomas claims that the man who committed suicide after his capture in Lüneburg in May 1945, was not in fact Heinrich Himmler. Thomas's book on this subject, \"SS-1: The Unlikely Death of Heinrich Himmler\", sets out the alleged deception in great detail.\n\nThis theory is not generally accepted by historians.\n\nSoviet leader Joseph Stalin is alleged to have had a double, identified only as \"Rashid\". Officials at the KGB allegedly learned that Rashid was a \"double\" for Stalin and employed him to replace Stalin for some public functions after World War II. Rashid spent two years studying with Alexei Dikiy, an actor who played the role of Stalin in propaganda films. Rashid claimed there were other Stalin lookalikes employed by the KGB, although he never met any. He claimed to have heard of another Stalin double who was hired to live in the leader's dacha outside of Moscow in the late 1940s and 1950s when Stalin was dying. This double filled in for Stalin for media events and at times when Stalin had to meet government functionaries and others. Rashid died in 1991, aged 93.\n\nIn 2008 another one of Stalin's doubles, Felix Dadaev, came forward, having written a book about his adventures as a political decoy. The Putin government gave him permission to tell his story at age 88.\nHe appeared in a 2014 documentary about Stalin's last days on German television.\n\nThe U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had planned to bring down Indonesia's first president Sukarno by portraying him in a pornographic film in the late 1950s.\n\nThe agency put together a pornographic film starring a Sukarno look-alike in bed with a blonde playing a Soviet agent. The humiliation caused by circulating the film was supposed to drive Sukarno from office, but the plan was unsuccessful.\n\nA former aide to Henry Kissinger has gone on the record with claims that Kissinger was impersonated at least once during his secret visit to China in 1971. Since no one was allowed to examine 'Kissinger' at close quarters, the resemblance of the impersonator to his 'target' must remain under some doubt.\n\nIn 1998, Duma deputy Aleksandr Salii asked the office of the Russian Prosecutor-General to investigate claims that a double had been impersonating Boris Yeltsin for official purposes since the real Yeltsin's heart surgery in November 1996. Salii told journalists that he and colleagues had examined some 1,500 photographs and gathered evidence showing that a \"New Yeltsin\" had appeared after 1996, with the supposed decoy frequently displaying his injured hand, whereas the real Yeltsin had always tried to conceal that hand. Yeltsin had frequently disappeared from public view in preceding years, sometimes in circumstances that aroused widespread suspicion. In July 1995, Yeltsin disappeared from public view for weeks following a heart operation. A photograph of Yeltsin was released to dispel rumours about his health, which actually inflamed the situation when it emerged that it appeared to be a staged photograph based on a photograph taken some months earlier.\n\nIn 2003, German television network ZDF broadcast claimed that Iraq's former president Saddam Hussein was frequently replaced with doubles for TV appearances. This analysis was based on sophisticated measuring techniques, which detected discrepancies in the position of Hussein's facial features and blemishes from appearance to appearance. It was supported by the opinion of Jerrold Post, the man who created the CIA's Psychological Profile Unit. It was also alleged that Austrian politician Jörg Haider had actually met a double when he thought he was meeting Hussein.\n\nThis claim is however disputed. Ala Bashir, Saddam Hussein's former personal physician, stated, \"The stories about Saddam Hussein having body doubles, to foster the impression that the Iraqi dictator was everywhere, are nonsense.\"\n\nThese are generally exceptionally good impersonators, who are used to give the impression that their \"target\" is conducting a radio interview, telephone call or other vocal assignment.\n\nA recurring rumour holds that some of Winston Churchill's most famous speeches to Parliament during World War II were subsequently recorded for radio broadcast not by Churchill, but by Norman Shelley impersonating Churchill. Churchill is known to have commented that Shelley's impersonations were excellent. Although the rumour has been promoted by some historians, there is a lack of supporting evidence, and it is best classified as an urban legend. Shelley did however record a performance of Churchill's \"We shall fight on the beaches\" speech, but that was several years after the speech was originally made.\n\nEdwin Wright served the U.S. federal government under President Harry S. Truman as General staff G-2 and Middle East specialist, Washington (1945–46); on the Bureau of Near East-South Asian-African Affairs, Department of State (1946 onwards); country specialist (1946–47); advisor U.N. affairs (1947–50); and advisor on intelligence (1950–55).\n\nAccording to Wright, an unknown individual impersonated President Truman's voice on the telephone in order to sway foreign leaders into voting in particular ways at the United Nations.\n\nThere are two documents from Truman himself alleging this, both currently lodged at the Truman Presidential Library.\n\nIn the first, Truman wrote:\nWright comments, \"In other words, somebody impersonated President Truman and threatened the President of Haiti. There were people who used President Truman's voice and name and he didn't know who they were.\"\n\nIn a cross-gender voice impersonation in 1971, a former captain of the Indian Army named Rustom Sohrab Nagarwala (male) was able to take out 6 million rupees from the State Bank of India by mimicking the voice of prime minister Indira Gandhi to chief cashier Ved Prakash Malhotra. Nagarwala was arrested, however, after Malhotra went in person to collect a receipt from P. N. Haksar, Indira Gandhi's personal secretary, informing him that the requested payment was done. A stunned Haksar informed Malhotra that Mrs Gandhi had instructed nothing of the sort and urged him to inform the police immediately. Later that year, Nagarwala died of a heart attack in prison.\n\nFor many years, the story of the Bisley Boy tempted people into believing that Queen Elizabeth I of England was really a man. According to the legend, Elizabeth (then a princess) had died aged 10 while staying at Berkeley Castle, Gloucestershire. Her minders, terrified of the retribution of her father, Henry VIII, made a substitution. A lookalike boy from the nearby village of Bisley was put in her place and sworn to secrecy. This legend \"explained\" why Elizabeth never married or had children. Proponents of the \"Bisley Boy\" story included Bram Stoker in his 1910 nonfiction book \"Famous Impostors\".\n\nIt is possible that the tale was invented as a joke by a local clergyman in the 19th century.\n\n"}

There are two churches dedicated to him in England, at Grantham, Lincolnshire, and Ovingdean, Sussex, and two in France, one at Abbeville, in the \"département\" of Somme, the other in Butot, in the département of the Seine Maritime. As a patron saint, he protects against the dangers of the sea.\n\nWulfram was born in the diocese of Meaux, at \"Mauraliacus\", an insecurely identified place near Fontainebleau, probably Milly-la-Forêt, Essonne. He was the son of a certain Fulbert, a knight attached to the court of Dagobert I, king of the Franks. King Dagobert's kingdom was divided on his death, and it was close to the court of his partial successor, Clovis II, king of Neustria and Burgundy that Wulfram is likely to have been born a little after Dagobert had died in 639.\n\nWulfram was educated at Clovis' court and showed a gift for academic learning. He took holy orders and seems to have intended a quiet life but was called to the court of Theodoric III (Thierry III) of Neustria. This seems to have propelled him into greater prominence since, in 692, he was elected Archbishop of Sens. There are various versions of the date for this, the earliest being in 682. However, by 693 he was in the post as he attended an assembly of bishops at Valenciennes.\n\nIn 695, he resigned the archbishopric in favor of Saint Amatus, who, it seems, he thought would be better at that sort of work, and retired to the Benedictine abbey called \"Fontenelle\". There are several places called Fontenelle, but this was probably at St-Wandrille, near Caudebec-en-Caux on the lower Seine, in the Diocese of Rouen. However, Johannes Madey places it at Fontenelle in the extreme north of the département of Aisne.\n\nIt is said } that when Saint Boniface withdrew from his missionary work in Friesland, in order to visit Rome for the second time, St. Wulfram stood in for him in Friesland. However, Boniface was a younger contemporary, his first and abortive mission in Frisia began in 716 or so, probably after Wulfram had died.\n\nWhatever the order of these events, in Frisia, St. Wulfram converted the son of King Radbod and was allowed to preach. The custom was that people, including children, were sacrificed to the local gods having been selected by a form of lottery. Wulfram, having remonstrated with Radbod on the subject, was told that the king was unable to change the custom but Wulfram was invited to save them if he could. The saint then waded into the sea to save two children who had been tied to posts and left to drown as the tide rose. According to the story, the turning point came with the rescue of a man, Ovon, who had been chosen by lot to be sacrificed by hanging. Wulfram begged King Radbod to stop the killing, but the people were outraged at the sacrilege proposed. In the end, they agreed that Wulfram's God could have a chance to save Ovon's life, and if he did, Wulfram and the God could have him. Ovon was hanged, and left for a couple of hours, while Wulfram prayed. When the Frisians decided to leave Ovon for dead, the rope broke, Ovon fell and was still alive. Ovon became Wulfram's slave, his follower, a monk, and then a priest at Fontenelle Abbey. The faith of the missionaries (and their power to work miracles) frightened and awed the people, who were baptized and turned away from paganism.\n\nEven Radbod seemed ready for conversion, but just before his baptism, he asked where his ancestors were. Wulfram told him that idolaters went to Hell. Rather than be apart from his ancestors, he chose to stay as he was.\n\nHe retired to Fontenelle, where he died in 703. The saint’s year of death is sometimes given as 720, but his interred body is said to have been moved in 704. Regardless of the exact year, St. Wulfram's feast day is kept on 20 March. He was buried in St. Paul’s chapel in the abbey, but in 704, he was re-buried in the main church. The body was again moved in 1058, this time to the collegiate church of Our Lady in Abbeville, which was then re-dedicated in Wulfram’s name. The translation of his body to Abbeville is commemorated on 15 October.\n\nAt about this time or later, perhaps when his body was again moved, this time to Rouen, his arm was taken as a relic to Croyland Abbey, Lincolnshire. The interest in him there may have arisen from Ingulph, the abbot being a former monk of Fontenelle. Also, everyone concerned was a Benedictine. Ingulph, who died in 1109, was secretary to William I, who made him Abbot of Crowland in 1086.\n\nA hagiographical account of his miracles was produced at the Abbey of Saint Wandrille before 1066. Among the miracles are two pertaining to childbirth and children. In one, Wulfram is credited with the miraculous delivery of a stillborn baby, the mother having commenced labor on 20 January (the feast day of Saint Sebastian). A week after Easter, prayers to Wulfram caused her belly to split open so the dead child could be delivered, after which the wound healed as if it had never been, leaving only a \"token of the cut\". In the other, Wulfram is credited with the safe passage of an accidentally swallowed clothespin, which left the body of a two-year-old boy after three days without having injured it: \"Is it not miraculous how through all the twists of the boy's intestines, as if through fine small round tubes, the copper sharp object, now going up high, now going down low, could travel without getting stuck anywhere or causing wounds, and so at last through Nature's lower parts find a way out all in one piece?\"\n\nAfter the building at Crowland was damaged by fire, there was no longer a suitable place for keeping the relic, so it went to Grantham for safe-keeping. For two or three hundred years, it was kept in the crypt chapel below the Lady Chapel, where the pilgrims helped to wear the hollow, now to be seen in stone step before the altar. Later, towards 1350, the arm went to the specially added chapel above the north porch. At some stage in the long process of the English Reformation, this relic was lost.\n\n\nMuch comes from the websites listed below but also:\n\n"}

{"id": "2320784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320784", "title": "HMS Naiad (1797)", "text": "HMS Naiad (1797)\n\nHMS \"Naiad\" was a Royal Navy fifth-rate frigate that served in the Napoleonic Wars. She was built by Hall and Co. at Limehouse on the Thames, launched in 1797, and commissioned in 1798. She served in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and her last actions occurred in 1824-5. She was paid off in 1826. She then served for many years in Latin America as a coal depot, first for the Royal Navy and then for the Pacific Steam Navigation Company. She was broken up in 1898, 101 years after her launching.\n\n\"Naiad\" was built to a design by Sir William Rule. She was an expanded version of his \"Amazon\"-class frigates.\n\nCaptain William Pierrepoint took command of \"Naiad\" in April 1797.\n\nOn 3 April 1798 \"Naiad\" captured \"Mary and Elizabeth\". Sixteen days later, \"Naiad\", and were in sight when captured the French gun-brig \"Arrogante\". \"Arrogante\" was armed with six long 24-pounder guns and had a crew of 92 men. The British took her into service as HMS \"Arrogante\", but then renamed her HMS \"Insolent\" in August. Next, \"Naiad\" and took \"Vriendfchap Beerens\" on 16 May.\n\nOn 11 August, some 42 leagues from Cape Finisterre, and after a chase of four hours, \"Naiad\" captured the French privateer \"Tigre\", which was under the command of Stephen Bonaventure Aggaret. \"Tigre\" was armed with eight 4-pounder guns and eight swivels. She had a crew of 31 men, having put another 22 men aboard the prizes that she had taken in the eight days since she had left Groire.\n\nNext, on 24 August, \"Naiad\" was chasing a French frigate, which chase joined. After about three hours the two British ships had caught up with their quarry, which proceeded for the next hour to fire on them with her stern chasers. She then struck. The French ship was the frigate \"Décade\", with a crew of 336 men under the command of Citoyen Villeneau. \"Décade\" was pierced for 44 guns, but she had landed ten in Cayenne, from where she was sailing. In all, \"Naiad\" had chased \"Décade\" for 36 hours. The British took \"Décade\" into service.\n\n\"Naiad\"s success in prize-taking continued. On 5 March 1799 she captured the French privateer \"Hereux Hazard\", off the Loire. \"Heureux Hazard\" was armed with sixteen 6 and 9-pounder guns, but was pierced for 20 guns. She had a crew of 94 men and had left Nantes the previous day, provisioned for a three-month cruise. At the time of the capture and were in sight, and so entitled to share in the prize money.\n\nThe next day \"Naiad\" met up with \"Ethalion\", which had just that day too captured the privateer \"Indefatigable\", of 18 guns and 120 men. \"Indefatigable\" too was just one day out of Nantes and provisioned for a long cruise. On 12 March \"Naiad\", , , and were in company when \"Triton\" captured the French merchant brig \"Victoire\".\n\nIn September \"Naiad\" recaptured the ship \"Princess Royal\". However, \"Naiad\"s biggest prize was yet to come.\n\nOn 15 October 1799 \"Naiad\" sighted two Spanish frigates. Pierrepont gave chase and before dawn spotted them and joined the pursuit. At 7.00 am the two Spaniards parted company so Pierrepont followed one frigate, together with and \"Triton\", which too had joined the chase, while directing \"Ethalion\", to pursue the other frigate. By 11.30 am, \"Ethalion\" had caught up with her quarry and after a short engagement the Spanish vessel struck her colours. \"Ethalion\" had no casualties though the Spaniard had one man killed and nine wounded.\n\n\"Triton\", the fastest of the three British frigates, led the chase of the first frigate. The next morning \"Triton\" struck some rocks as she tried to prevent her quarry from reaching port. \"Triton\" got off the rocks and resumed the chase despite taking on water. She and \"Alcmene\" then exchanged fire with the Spanish frigate, which surrendered before \"Naiad\" could catch up. Four large Spanish ships came out from Vigo but then retreated when the three British frigates made ready to receive them. \"Alcmene\" had one man killed and nine wounded, and \"Triton\" had one man wounded; had two men killed and eight men wounded.\n\nThe vessel that \"Ethalion\" had captured turned out to be \"Thetis\", under the command of Captain Don Juan de Mendoza. She was homeward-bound from Vera Cruz (Mexico) with a cargo of cocoa, cochineal and sugar, and more importantly, specie worth 1,385,292 Spanish dollars (£312,000). The vessel that \"Triton\", \"Alcmene\", and \"Naiad\" had captured was \"Santa Brigada\", under the command of Captain Don Antonio Pillon. She was carrying a cargo of drugs, annatto, cochineal, indigo and sugar, and some 1,500,000 dollars. Prize money was paid on 14 January 1800.\n\nAt some point \"Triton\", with \"Naiad\", \"Alcmene\", and \"Ethalion\" in company, recaptured the American ship \"Abigail\".\n\nOn 12 September 1800 the hired armed cutter \"Suwarrow\" cut out the French brig \"Providence\" from under two batteries near Camaret Point. She was carrying wine, soap and brandy for the Brest fleet; the capture took place under heavy fire but \"Suworow\" suffered no casualties. Although the third rate and \"Naiad\" were in sight, they voluntarily relinquished their share of the prize money to \"Suwarrow\".\n\nIn December Captain the Honorable John Murray replaced Pierrepont, who was ill. \"Naiad\" spent the following year cruising out of Plymouth.\n\nIn December 1800, Captain William H. Rickets replaced Murray of \"Naiad\". At the beginning of May 1801 she recaptured, some 500 miles west of Cape Finisterre, the packet \"Phoenix\", Captain Thompson. \"Phoenix\" had sailed from Falmouth on 15 April for New York and had the misfortune to encounter a French 40-gun privateer on 21 April. Although he could not escape capture, Thompson was able to sink his mails before being boarded. While still a French prize, \"Phoenix\" also encountered \"Concarde\" and \"Corneille\", two large French frigates taking troops and stores from Nantes to Egypt. After her recapture, \"Phoenix\" arrived safely in Plymouth on 11 May. The hired armed cutter \"Earl St Vincent\" shared in the capture.\n\nOn the night of 16 May 1801, boats from \"Naiad\" and , under the direction of \"Naiad\"s First lieutenant, entered the port of Marín, Pontevedra, in Galicia in north-west Spain. There they captured the Spanish corvette \"Alcudia\" and destroyed the armed packet \"Raposo\", both under the protection of a battery of five 24-pounders. \"Alcudia\", commanded by Don Jean Antonio Barbuto, was moored stem and stern close to the fort. Her sails had previously been taken ashore so the boats had to tow her out but soon after a strong south-west wind set in and Rickets thought it necessary to set her on fire. \"Naiad\" and \"Phaeton\" suffered only four men wounded.\n\n\"Naiad\" returned to Plymouth on 25 May 1801 and now under the command of Captain Phillip Wilkinson sailed again on 6 June with bullocks and vegetables for the Channel fleet. She was back in Plymouth for two days at the end of August.\n\nAt the end of October a violent gale almost wrecked \"Naiad\" near the Île de Ré. She sat for two days on shore under the guns of a French battery, which, much to the mystification of her captain and crew, did not fire on them. On the second day the French commander sent boats with spare cables and anchors and informed Wilkinson that England had signed the preliminaries of a peace treaty with France. \"Naiad\" returned to Plymouth on 1 November.\n\nThroughout most of 1802 \"Naiad\" was in ordinary but on 9 September orders came down for her to be commissioned in place of , which was to be paid off. Captain James Wallis and the crew of \"Fisgard\" were to transfer to \"Naiad\" when she was ready for commissioning. On 18 December it was announced that \"Naiad\" would have to supply men to , then fitting out for foreign service, if \"Belleisle\" was still short crew. Apparently they were not needed.\n\nIn early 1803, \"Naiad\" succeeded in taking several prizes. Her boats, with those from , cut out a new brig from among the Penmarks off Brest while under fire from French batteries. They also cut out and sank a chasse-maree. These were probably the French brig \"Jeanne\" and the galiot \"Balier\", which they captured on 10 May. On 19 May \"Naiad\" and \"Hazard\" also captured \"Frauen Brigitta\".\n\nOn 29 May, in the Bay of Biscay, \"Naiad\" captured the French corvette \"Impatiente\", which was under the command of Citizen Hypolite Arnous, \"lieutenant de vaisseau\". \"Impatient\" was armed with 20 guns, some of which she had thrown overboard during the chase. She and her crew were sailing from Senegal to Rochefort when \"Naiad\" captured her. Two days later \"Naiad\" captured the French merchant ship \"Chasseur\", of 359 tons burthen. She was under the command of Citizen Lamar, Lieutenant de Vaisseau, and was carrying sugar, cotton and coffee from San Domingo to Lorient.\n\nNext, \"Naiad\" and captured a French brig from the Straits and a Dutch sloop, also from the Straits, carrying drugs and medicines. \"Naiad\" and \"Doris\" also took a French corvette from Gorée laden with gum and ivory. These vessels came into Plymouth on 4 June. That same day \"Naiad\" arrived with two French ships and two Dutch ships that she and \"Doris\" had also captured.\n\nThen 2 June, \"Naiad\" captured \"Napoleon\", a French brig from Guadeloupe bound for Nantes with sugar and coffee. On 5 July she captured \"Providence\". On 8 July she captured the brig \"Prudente\", and on 8 August the brig \"Anne Marie\".\n\nOn 4 July Wallis sent \"Naiad\"s boats to cut out a French schooner lying at anchor at the Saints. Next morning, in spite of the strong tides and the many rocks and shoals in the area, they brought the schooner out without loss as almost the entire crew, including the commander, Citizen Martres Preville, \"lieutenant de vaisseau\", had fled at their approach. The prize was \"Providence\", which had only two guns mounted but was laden with 36, 24 and 18-pounder cannon she was taking to Brest from a foundry near Nantes. Her cargo also included some choice timber.\n\n\"Naiad\" returned to Plymouth from her cruise on 7 September and went in for a refit. This was completed on 2 October when she went from Barnpool out into the Sound to await orders. On 5 October she received six months of wages, and sailed the next day down the Channel, before anyone could spend any of their accumulated pay.\n\nDuring the following fifteen weeks \"Naiad\" cruised off Ferrol and Corunna with Sir Edward Pellew's squadron. The squadron experienced severe gales but in spite of the weather blowing them off station on several occasions, the squadron succeeded in preventing the French squadrons from Ferrol and Corunna linking up. On 29 November forced the French frigate \"Bayonnaise\" aground in Finisterre Bay where her crew set fire to her so that she blew up. \"Naiad\" was among the vessels in Pellew's squadron sharing, by agreement, in the head money.\n\n\"Naiad\" left the squadron on 8 January 1804 when they were close in to Ferrol, to carry dispatches to Admiral William Cornwallis off Ushant. She left the Admiral on 10 January and arrived back in Plymouth four days later.\n\nOn 31 January 1804 Captain J. Pellew was appointed to command \"Naiad\" while Wallis was dangerously ill at home in Storehouse. At some point in 1804 Captain Thomas Dundas took command of \"Naiad\".\n\nHer next station was with the squadron off Brest and she brought back dispatches for the Admiralty on 10 May.\n\nOn 15 June a court martial ordered the Honorable Alexander Jones, then a lieutenant in \"Naiad\", to be shot for striking Lieutenant William Dean, the senior lieutenant, during a quarrel. Dean was dismissed from the service for ungentlemanly conduct. The court recommended clemency for Jones; ten days later he received a pardon and was restored to his former rank. (Jones was promoted to Commander on 22 January 1806. Dean was restored to his former rank in 1821 but died five years later.) \"Naiad\" sailed for a cruise off the coast of Spain on 24 September.\n\nOn 27 November, while \"Naiad\" was off Brest, Thomas saw some small vessels open musket fire on boats belonging to and wound two seamen. \"Naiad\" captured Gun-boats Nos. 361 and 369. Each mounted one long brass 4-pounder and one short 12-pounder and had on board a lieutenant from the 63rd Infantry Regiment, 36 privates and six seamen. They had sailed with fourteen others from Dandiorne to Brest. Thomas sent the gunboats back to Britain under the escort of .\n\n\"Naiad\" returned to Plymouth on 7 January 1805 from a cruise off the coast of Spain. She brought with her a large Spanish ship with 200,000 dollars on board plus a valuable cargo of dry goods. This was \"Nuestra Senora de los Dolores\", which \"Naiad\" had captured on five days earlier. \"Naiad\" sailed again on 8 January on a cruise to the westward. She sent in a neutral ship flying Papenburg colours, suspected of carrying Spanish property.\n\nOn 15 February \"Naiad\" was in sight when \"Hazard\" captured the Dutch schooner \"Der Vriede\". Next, \"Naiad\" capture \"Mars\" on 25 June. \"Naiad\" was in company with on 9 July 1805 when they captured the brig \"Argo\" and the sloop \"Nelly\". Then on 10 September \"Naiad\" detained the American ship \"Wells\", of eleven men and 205 tons (bm). \"Wells\" was sailing from Salem to Marseilles with a cargo of sugar and coffee.\n\nCirca 1 October, the arrival of the frigates \"Naiad\", , , , and off Cadiz allowed Nelson to detach them to disrupt local shipping supplying provisions for the joint fleet in Cadiz. By 10 October \"Naiad\" was engaged in the tactical preparations etc. for the forthcoming battle. On 20 October the combined fleet departed Cadiz.\n\nDuring the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October, \"Naiad\" was too small to take part in the battle itself. Instead, she lay to windward of the action. After the battle she destroyed the grounded \"Monarca\" and towed to Gibraltar.\n\nIn September 1806 Parliament voted a grant of £300,000 to the participants in the battle, with the crew of \"Naiad\" being among the beneficiaries. In 1847, the Admiralty issued the NGSM with clasp \"Trafalgar\" to all surviving claimants from the battle.\n\n\"Naiad\" was in company with and the gun-brigs and when they captured the ship \"William Little\", John J. P. Cbamptin, master, on 17 October 1806.\n\nOn 13 August 1807, brought dispatches from England to \"Naiad\", which was with the squadron blockading Bordeaux. Lieutenant Le Blanc, captain of \"Cassandra\", left her to take the dispatches to \"Naiad\". Two sudden squalls rolled \"Cassandra\" over on her beam ends, capsizing her. She sank stern first. Eleven men, and one woman and her child drowned.\n\nThree months later, on 10 October 1807, \"Naiad\" captured the Kniphausen galliot \"Vigilante\". At the time of the capture, and were in sight.\n\nIn 1808 \"Naiad\" participated in the blockade of Brest. On 23 May was in company with \"Naiad\" when they captured the American packet ship \"Margaret Tingey\".\n\nBetween June and August \"Naiad\" was in Plymouth making good defects. Then \"Naiad\" was in company when captured the French schooner \"Louise\" on 9 November. On 16 December \"Naiad\" was still in company with \"Narcissus\", when they captured two French privateers, \"Fanny\" and \"Superb\" while on the Home station. \"Fanny\" carried 16 guns and a crew of 80 men. She was under the command of Charles Hamon, who as captain of the privateer \"Venus\", had captured numerous British vessels. \"Fanny\" was only a few hours out of Nantes on her way to the Irish coast and had made no captures. Then at midnight \"Naiad\" and \"Narcissus\" captured the French letter of marque sloop \"Superb\". \"Superb\" was armed with four guns, had a crew of 20 men, and was sailing to Martinique with a cargo of sundries.\n\nOn 7 February 1809 \"Naiad\" was in the squadron under the command of Commodore William Hotham and so shared in the proceeds of the capture of the French vessel \"Prudent\". Then on 23 February \"Naiad\" was at anchor to the north-west of the Chassiron lighthouse with , and \"Emerald\", the squadron now being under the command of Rear Admiral Robert Stopford in . The next day they saw eight sail-of-the-line and two frigates flying French colours and standing into the Pertuis d'Antioche.\n\nStopford immediately sent \"Naiad\" to warn Admiral Lord Gambier that the French squadron from Brest had arrived but, before she had gone a few miles, \"Naiad\" sighted three French frigates heading for Les Sables-d'Olonne and signalled Stopford. Stopford left and \"Emerald\" to watch the enemy and went in chase of the frigates with the rest of his squadron, now strengthened by the arrival of and . The French anchored under the protection of batteries but the fire from the British ships soon drove them ashore. By 2 March her crew had abandoned one of the French frigates. The other two were afloat at high water but on their beam ends at low water; a westerly swell was expected to destroy them. Stopford returned to blockade the main French force at the Ile d'Aix until 7 March when Gambier arrived to take command.\n\nFrom March to October \"Naiad\" was under the command of Captain George Cocks (acting). Captain Henry Hill then assumed command. On 22 March \"Naiad\", under the command of Cocks, and in company with , captured the \"Josephine\". Next, on 14 April, \"Naiad\" recaptured \"Renomée\". A week later she captured \"Speculation\". Then on 25 April she captured \"Maria Dorothea\". On 19 July \"Naiad\" was in company with when they captured the schooner \"Eugenie\".\n\nOn 8 August three Danish vessels arrived at Leith. They were prizes to , \"Naiad\", and .\n\nOn 21 October \"Naiad\", now under the command of Hill, recaptured the ship \"Minerva\". \"Naiad\" was among the vessels in sight when the schooner captured the French brig \"Modeste\".\n\nOn 21 January 1810, \"Naiad\" captured the French chasse maree \"St. Anne\".\n\nA court martial was held on board \"Salvador del Mundo\" in the Hamoaze On 26 and 27 March. The accused were eight petty officers and seamen from \"Naiad\". The charge was that they had written mutinous letters to the Admiralty, complaining of tyrannical treatment by Hill, and had tried to induce the ship's company to request that they be drafted from \"Naiad\". Three crew members were sentenced be hanged. One received a sentence of 150 lashes; one of 100; and two of 50 lashes each around the fleet. In June Captain Wolley read a pardon to the men sentenced to death, and delivered a suitable admonition. Most of the rest of the men were also pardoned. On 23 May 1810, \"Naiad\" recaptured . \n\nIn 1811 Hill left \"Naiad\"; being too senior to command a frigate, he was not employed again.\n\nHill's replacement in July 1811 was Captain Philip Carteret. On 19 August , with \"Naiad\" in company, captured \"Woodman\". Under Carteret \"Naiad\" participated in an action with gunboats off Boulogne on 20 September. The French flotilla consisted of seven praams of twelve 24-pounder guns each, ten brigs of four long 24-pounders guns each, and one sloop with two long 24-pounders. The praams' crews totalled about 120 men, and they were under the command of Rear-Admiral Baste. The praams cannonaded \"Naiad\" for about three-quarters of an hour before the other vessels came up and added desultory fire for another two hours. Eventually the French vessels gave up their attack and returned to the safety of anchorages under the protection of batteries. In all this \"Naiad\" suffered no casualties.\n\nOn 20 September \"Naiad\" captured the 16-gun vessel \"Ville de Lyon\". \"Ville de Lyon\" was a praam belonging to the Boulogne Flotilla, under the command of Commodore Jean Baptiste Coupe and Captain Jean Barbaud. She was armed with twelve long 24-pounder guns and a complement of 112 men, 60 of them soldiers from the 72 Regiment. The seven praams came out again to attack \"Naiad\" and the three brigs in company with her: , and . The British squadron moved to engage and \"Naiad\" was able to separate \"Ville de Lyons\" from her consorts and capture her. The brigs drove off the other praams but were unable to capture any before they again took refuge under the protection of the shore batteries. In the engagement \"Naiad\" suffered two men killed and 14 wounded. Carteret estimated that the French had lost 30 to 40 men killed and wounded. \"Redpole\" had no casualties, \"Castilian\" lost her first lieutenant killed and one man wounded, and \"Rinaldo\" had her pilot wounded.\n\n\"Naiad\" left Deal on 29 September 1811 to cruise off Boulogne. This cruise yielded two prizes. On 6 October she captured the French privateer lugger \"Milan\" in the Channel. \"Milan\" was armed with 16 guns, though only two were mounted, and had a crew of 42 men. She had left that morning from Dieppe.\n\nA week later \"Naiad\" returned with the privateer \"Reinarde\", which she had captured off Dieppe. On 27 October \"Naiad\" sailed again and by 6 November she had captured the French privateer lugger \"Requin\", which she brought in a few days later. \"Requin\" was armed with two guns, and had 14 stowed in the hold. She had a crew of 58 men and was out of Boulogne.\n\nOn 12 April 1812, Carteret was in his boat sailing from Portsmouth to Lymington when it upset off Cowes. Three crewmen drowned but Carteret was picked up, exhausted, and taken to Cowes.\n\n\"Naiad\" was paid off in Portsmouth in 1813. She was then fitted there to raise the wreck of the merchantman \"Queen Charlotte\".\n\nFrom July 1814 to April 1815 \"Naiad\" underwent major repairs at Portsmouth. Captain Robert C. Spencer commissioned her in April 1823 for the Channel and the Mediterranean and until August she underwent fitting for sea.\n\nIn January 1824, \"Naiad\" and visited Algiers, following a violation of the British consul's offices, in order to demand satisfaction from the Dey. By 31 January it was apparent that British citizens living in Algiers were no longer safe so they were taken on board. On departing from the harbour, \"Naiad\" sighted the Algerine corvette \"Tripoli\", which had recently committed depredations on Spanish trade, in contravention of the Treaty of 1816. Fire from \"Naiad\" reduced \"Tripoli\" to a wreck. A party from \"Cameleon\" boarded \"Tripoli\" before \"Naiad\" ordered them to abandon the vessel. Captain Spencer of \"Naiad\" was particularly pleased to discover that by capturing the Algerine he had liberated 17 Spaniards that were being carried into slavery.\n\nOn 18 March \"Naiad\" captured \"Quattro Fratelli\". shared the prize money.\n\nThen on 23 May at Boma \"Naiad\"s boats burnt an Algerine brig of war that had sought refuge under the guns of the fortress there. The brig was armed with 16 guns, some of which had been transferred to the fort. The letter reporting the action makes no mention of casualties.\n\nOn 23 February 1825 \"Naiad\" captured \"Muni\". shared in the prize money.\n\nOn 28 May four seamen from \"Naiad\" were drowned off the coast of Italy. \"Naiad\"s captain had a monument erected for them in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome.\n\nIn March 1826 Spencer and \"Naiad\" conducted a mission to Ibrahim Pasha, the general in command of the Ottoman forces besieging Missolonghi on the Gulf of Patras.

{"id": "2320803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320803", "title": "Heroic drama", "text": "Heroic drama\n\nHeroic drama is a type of play popular during the Restoration era in England, distinguished by both its verse structure and its subject matter. The subgenre of heroic drama evolved through several works of the middle to later 1660s; John Dryden's \"The Indian Emperour\" (1665) and Roger Boyle's \"The Black Prince\" (1667) were key developments.\n\nThe term \"heroic drama\" was invented by Dryden for his play, \"The Conquest of Granada\" (1670). For the \"Preface\" to the printed version of the play, Dryden argued that the drama was a species of \"epic poetry\" for the stage, that, as the epic was to other poetry, so the heroic drama was to other plays. Consequently, Dryden derived a series of rules for this type of play.\n\nFirst, the play should be composed in heroic verse (closed couplets in iambic pentameter). Second, the play must focus on a subject that pertains to national foundations, mythological events, or important and grand matters. Third, the hero of the heroic drama must be powerful, decisive, and, like Achilles, dominating even when wrong. \"The Conquest of Granada\" followed all of these rules. The story was that of the national foundation of Spain (and King Charles II was known to be fond of Spanish plays), and the hero, Almanzor, was a man of great martial prowess and temperament.\n\nDryden's \"Conquest of Granada\" is often considered one of the better heroic tragedies, but his highest achievement is his adaptation (which he called \"All for Love\", 1678) of Shakespeare's \"Anthony and Cleopatra\" to the heroic formula. Other heroic dramatists were Nathaniel Lee (\"The Rival Queens\") and Thomas Otway, whose \"Venice Preserved\" is a fine tragedy that transcends the usual limitations of the form. We also owe indirectly to heroic tragedy two very amusing parodies of the type: the Duke of Buckingham's \"The Rehearsal\" and Henry Fielding's \"The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great\"\n\n\"Those who associate 'heroic drama' primarily with the use of the 'heroic couplet' usually set as its extent the years from 1664 to 1678. This, certainly, is its period of fullest development and authority. Those who prefer to accentuate the elements suggested by the very term 'heroic' rather than the strict rhymed verse form are willing to admit wider limits.\" Restoration plays by Sir William Davenant, Thomas Otway, Nathaniel Lee, John Crowne, Elkanah Settle, and John Banks, and later works by Nicholas Rowe and Joseph Addison, have been included in tighter or looser definitions of heroic drama.\n\nToday, drama is divided up into numerous subgenres; Dryden, however, worked from Classical critics. There was little dramatic critical theory for him to appeal to, and the new rules brought over from France (particularly those of Corneille and Boileau) did not match English theatrical history or practice. The emphasis on unities and on maintaining only Classically proscribed dramatic forms also came from Thomas Rymer, who condemned the heterogeneity of the stage. Aristotle had only spoken of satire, epic, and tragedy, and Horace also wrote only of comedy, tragedy and satire, and so Dryden was seeking to square actual theatrical practice with an ancient framework for literature. He was attempting his own neo-classicism. The First Folio of Shakespeare had divided Shakespeare's plays into \"history,\" \"tragedy,\" and \"comedy,\" but these terms were stretched. Dryden, therefore, implicitly recognizes that drama had moved into the territory of other types of poetry, but he strives to restrain that freedom by reforming the stage to a true and epic subject matter. \n\nGeorge Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and others satirized heroic drama in \"The Rehearsal\". The satire was successful enough that heroic drama largely disappeared afterward. Buckingham attacked the stupidity of blustering, military heroes, as well as the apparent self-importance of attempting a dramatic entertainment about the serious subjects of military and national history.\n\nBuckingham's criticism of Dryden in \"The Rehearsal\" is partly Dryden's bombastic verse but, more pointedly, Dryden's \"personal\" interest in creating a \"pure\" drama. The character of Bayes is ludicrous more for his hubris in damning actual plays in favor of imagined ones than he is for being a poetaster.\n"}

{"id": "2320823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320823", "title": "National Liberal Club", "text": "National Liberal Club\n\nThe National Liberal Club (NLC) is a London private members' club, open to both men and women. It was established by William Ewart Gladstone in 1882 to provide club facilities for Liberal Party campaigners among the newly enlarged electorate following the Third Reform Act in 1884. The club's Italianate building on the Embankment of the river Thames is the second-largest club-house ever built. Designed by Alfred Waterhouse, it was completed in 1887. Its facilities include a dining room, a bar, function rooms, a billiards room, a smoking room, a library and an outdoor riverside terrace. It is located at Whitehall Place, close to the Houses of Parliament, the Thames Embankment and Trafalgar Square.\n\nThe genesis of the club lay with Liberal party activist (and later MP) Arthur John Williams, who proposed the creation of such a club at a Special General Meeting of the short-lived Century Club on 14 May 1882, so as to provide \"a home for democracy, void of the class distinction associated with the Devonshire and Reform Clubs\". The first full meeting of the new club was held on 16 November 1882, at the Westminster Palace Hotel on Victoria Street. The Century Club itself then merged into the NLC at the end of the year. In its early years, the club declared its objects to be: \nAn initial circular for subscribers meant that by the end of 1882, 2,500 men from over 500 towns and districts had already signed up for the new club, and membership would reach 6,500 by the time the clubhouse opened in 1887.\nThe club's foundation stone was laid by Gladstone on 9 November 1884, when he declared \"Speaking generally, I should say there could not be a less interesting occasion than the laying of the foundation-stone of a Club in London. For, after all, what are the Clubs of London? I am afraid little else than temples of luxury and ease. This, however, is a club of a very different character\", and envisioned the club as a popular institution for the mass electorate. However, another of the club's founders, G. W. E. Russell, noted \"We certainly never foresaw the palatial pile of terra-cotta and glazed tiles which now bears that name. Our modest object was to provide a central meeting-place for Metropolitan and provincial Liberals, where all the comforts of life should be attainable at what are called 'popular prices'\", but added \"at the least, we meant our Club to be a place of \"ease\" to the Radical toiler. But Gladstone insisted that it was to be a workshop dedicated to strenuous labour.\" Funds for the clubhouse were raised by selling 40,000 shares of £5 each, in a Limited Liability Company, with the unusual stipulation that \"No shareholder should have more than \"ten\" votes\", so as to prevent a few wealthy men from dominating the club. However, this only raised £70,000, and so an additional £52,400 was raised for the construction of the clubhouse by the Liberal Central Association. The remaining £30,000 necessary was raised by mortgage debentures.\n\nIn the five years between the club's establishment and completion of the building in 1887, it occupied temporary premises on the corner of Northumberland Avenue and Trafalgar Square. During this time, a parliamentary question was asked in the House of Commons about the White Ensign being raised on the club's flagpole as part of a prank.\n\nThe clubhouse was still unfinished when it opened its doors in 1887, but it was opened early on 20 June to allow members to watch that year's Jubilee processions from the club terrace. (The opening was marked by an inaugural banquet for 1,900 people at the Royal Aquarium off Parliament Square, which \"Punch\" reported saw the consumption of 200 dozen bottles of Pommery champagne.) It was when the club had only recently moved to its present address that \"Bloody Sunday\" ensued on its doorstep during the Trafalgar Square riot of 13 November 1887. NLC members flocked to the windows to watch George Bernard Shaw (a member of the club) address the demonstration, and later in the day, witnessed the bloodshed which ensued.\n\nIn its late-19th-century heyday, its membership was primarily political, but had a strong journalistic and even bohemian character. Members were known to finish an evening's dining by diving into the Thames. Of the club's political character, George Bernard Shaw remarked at a debate in the club, \"I have never yet met a member of the National Liberal Club who did not intend to get into Parliament at some time, except those who, like our chairman Lord Carrington, are there already.\"\n\nOn the club's launch, it represented all factions of liberalism, but within four years it was rocked by the Home Rule Crisis of 1886, which saw the Liberal Unionists led by Joseph Chamberlain and the Marquess of Hartington (both of whom had been founder members of the NLC) secede from the party and eventually go into alliance with the Conservatives. Indeed, Chamberlain had been one of the NLC's most enthusiastic promoters upon its launch. At the 1884 ceremony of Gladstone's foundation-stone-laying for the club, Hartington had argued that the club would be the future home of Chamberlain's Radical Birmingham Caucus, and Chamberlain pointedly refused to contradict him. Chamberlain himself resigned in 1886, shortly after the Home Rule split, Hartington and other prominent Liberal Unionists followed early in 1887, and when a further 130 Unionists simultaneously seceded from the club in 1889, the \"Scots Observer\" called it \"one of the most important events that has recently occurred in home politics\", due to its ramifications for the Liberal Party breaking in two.\n\nThe club enjoyed a reputation for radicalism, and H. V. Emy records that Radicals secured \nThis reputation for radicalism was underlined when former Liberal Prime Minister Lord Rosebery resigned from the club in September 1909, denouncing it as \"a hotbed of socialism.\"\n\nSeveral discussion groups met at the club, including the Rainbow Circle in the 1890s, an influential group of Liberal, Fabian and socialist thinkers who came to be identified with the Bloomsbury Group.\n\nIt was also the site of much intrigue in the Liberal Party over the years, rivalling the Reform Club as a social centre for Liberals by the advent of World War I, although its membership was largely based on Liberal activists in the country at large; it was built on such a large scale to provide London club facilities for Liberal activists from around the country, justifying its use of the description 'national'.\n\nOn 22 March 1893, during the Second Reading of the Clubs Registration Bill, the Conservative MP (and later Liberal defector) Thomas Gibson Bowles told the House of Commons \"I am informed there is an establishment not far from the House frequented by Radical millionaires and released prisoners, the National Liberal Club, where an enormous quantity of whisky is consumed.\" Despite this remark, it seems that the club accounted for relatively little alcohol consumption by the standards of the day – Herbert Samuel commented in 1909 that the average annual consumption of alcoholic liquor per NLC member was 31s. 4d. per annum, which compared very favourably with equivalent Conservative clubs, including 33s. 5d. for the nearby Constitutional Club, 48s. for the City Carlton Club, and 77s. for the Junior Carlton Club. One possible explanation is the strength of the Temperance movement in the Liberal party at the time.\n\nOn 3 December 1909, Liberal Chancellor David Lloyd George used the club to make a speech fiercely denouncing the House of Lords, in what was seen as a \"de facto\" launch of the \"People's Budget\" general election of January 1910.\n\nOn 21 November 1911, the club was one of a number of buildings to have their windows smashed in by the suffragette Women's Social and Political Union, in protest at the Liberal government's inaction over votes for women.\n\nDuring the Marconi scandal of 1912, Winston Churchill used a speech to the club to mount an impassioned defence of embattled ministers David Lloyd George and Rufus Isaacs, asserting that there was \"no stain of any kind\" upon their characters.\n\n From late 1916 to December 1919, the clubhouse was requisitioned by the British government for use as a billet for Canadian troops, the club relocating to nearby Northumberland Avenue in the meantime. Many of these troops were offered heavily discounted temporary club membership during their stay, although it appears that some overstayed their welcome – a \"farewell dinner\" by the club on 19 March 1919 attempted to hint that their departure was imminently expected. At the end of the First World War, the Canadian soldiers who had stayed there presented the club with a moose head as a gift of thanks, which was hung in the billiards room for many years. After the troops finally left in December 1919, the club was closed for a year for renovations (partly necessitated by the damage done by the troops), and did not re-open until 19 December 1920.\n\nAs H. H. Asquith was deposed as Prime Minister by David Lloyd George, he spent his last full evening as Prime Minister on 8 December 1916 reporting to a full meeting of the Liberal Party at the club. It provided an overwhelming vote of confidence in his leadership.\n\nDuring the party's 1916–23 split, the Asquith wing of the party was in the ascendant in the club, while Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George (who had been a regular by the Smoking Room in previous years, often found warming his bottom by the fireplace where his portrait now hangs) was personally shunned by many NLC members. This was a highly acrimonious time within the Liberal party, with both the Asquithian and Lloyd Georgeite factions believing themselves to be the 'true' Liberal party, and viewing the other faction as 'traitors'. Michael Bentley has written of this period that \"The \"Lloyd George Liberal Magazine\", which appeared monthly between October 1920 and December 1923, spent much space attacking the National Liberal Club for its continued Asquithian partisanship – in particular for its refusal to hang portraits of Lloyd George and Churchill in the main club rooms, or to accept nominations for membership from Coalition Liberals. The creation of a separate '1920 Club' in neighbouring Whitehall Court was one reaction to this treatment.\" The Lloyd George and Churchill portraits were removed in 1921 and put into the club's cellar. At the time, the Asquithians were popularly known as \"Wee Frees\", and historian Cameron Hazlehurst wrote that, \"the civilities of social life at the National Liberal Club were increasingly reserved by 'Wee Frees' for 'Wee Frees.'\"\n\nThe reunion of the two branches of the Liberal Party in the run-up to the December 1923 general election meant that the neighbouring 1920 Club for Lloyd George supporters was disbanded, and \"the portraits of Lloyd George and [fellow Lloyd George Liberal] Churchill, long consigned to the cellar, were recovered and reinstated in the places of honour in the smoking room\", although Churchill's defection back to the Conservatives within less than a year meant that his portrait was just as swiftly returned to the basement, and would not re-emerge for 16 years.\n\nThere is a well-known story told of the NLC, that the Conservative politician F. E. Smith would stop off there every day on his way to Parliament, to use the club's lavatories. One day the hall porter apprehended Smith and asked him if he was actually a member of the club, to which Smith replied \"Good god! You mean it's a club as well?\". This story, and apocryphal variations thereof (usually substituting Smith with Churchill), are told of many different clubs. The original related to the NLC, at the half-way point between Parliament and Smith's chambers in Elm Court, Temple. The comment was a jibe at the brown tiles in some of the NLC's late-Victorian architecture.\n\nDuring the hung parliament of 1923–24, it was at the club that Asquith – as Leader of the reunited Liberal Party – announced on 6 December 1923 that the Liberals would support Ramsay MacDonald in forming Britain's first ever Labour government.\n\nThe club continued to be a venue for large-scale meetings of Liberals. On Armistice Day 1924, over one hundred defeated Liberal candidates met at the club to express their anger at Lloyd George's failure to use his infamous \"Lloyd George fund\" to help the Liberals in the disastrous general election campaign one month earlier. After the 1929 general election, the first meeting of the newly expanded Parliamentary Liberal Party was held at the club, with all MPs except one (the independently minded Rhys Hopkin Morris) re-electing Lloyd George as Liberal Party Leader.\n\nIn 1932, the club first introduced non-political membership (now called Ordinary Membership). Michael Meadowcroft explains that this was done to provide, \"membership for Liberals who, by reason of their employment, such as judges, military officers or senior civil servants, were not permitted to divulge their politics\", and so who had been previously debarred by the club's insistence on all members signing a declaration of Liberal politics. This continues to this day, with Ordinary Members signing a pledge that they will \"not use the club or...membership thereof for political activities adverse to Liberalism\", and not having full voting rights at Annual General Meetings, but otherwise enjoying the full benefits of club membership.\n\nOn 11 May 1941 the club suffered a direct hit by a Luftwaffe bomb during the Blitz, which utterly destroyed the central staircase and caused considerable damage elsewhere. The £150,000 cost of reconstructing the staircase in 1950 placed a considerable strain on the club's finances, although generous support from the War Damage Commission helped to fund the new staircase. In the nine-year interim between the bomb blast and the rebuilding of the staircase, members had to use the stairs of the club's turret tower, often taking highly circuitous routes around the vast clubhouse.\n\nOne of the items damaged in the blast was the 1915 portrait of Winston Churchill (a member of the club), by Ernest Townsend. Ironically, after 25 years of being hidden from sight, it had only just been put on display the year before. Painted in the year of the Dardanelles Campaign, Churchill was soon unavailable for unveiling the portrait as he went into exile in the trenches. After his return, his strong support for the Lloyd George coalition meant that from 1916 he proved to be \"persona non-grata\" at the club, and this only increased after he left the Liberal Party in 1924. Thus from 1915 to 1940, the painting was held by the club in storage. When Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940, the club rushed out the painting and put it on display in the main lobby (where it still hangs today). It was bombed after one year, suffering a diagonal gash down the middle. The painting was then painstakingly restored, and Churchill re-unveiled it himself on 22 July 1943, at a ceremony also attended by his wife (a lifelong Liberal), Liberal Leader Sir Archibald Sinclair (a friend and colleague of over 30 years, then serving in Churchill's cabinet), lifelong friend Lady Violet Bonham Carter, Club chairman Lord Meston and cartoonist David Low.\n\nThe fortunes of the NLC have mirrored those of the Liberal Party – as the Liberals declined as a national force in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, so did the NLC. However, despite the Liberals' national decline, the NLC remained a focus for debate.\n\nIn the early 1950s, it was a centre of anti-ID card sentiment, and Harry Willcock, a member who successfully campaigned for the abolition of ID cards, tore his up in front of the club as a publicity stunt in 1951. He also died in the club during a debate held there on 12 December 1952, with his last word being \"Freedom.\"\n\nIt was at a debate at the club in 1971 that Yale professor James Tobin first publicly voiced his proposal for a \"Tobin tax\" on financial transactions.\n\nIn addition to the Blitz bombing in 1941, the club also sustained an attack from an IRA bomb at 12 past midnight on 22 December 1973 (as part of a concerted Christmas bombing campaign) which blew open the front door and gashed the duty manager's arm, while on 10 January 1992 an IRA briefcase bomb exploded outside the club, shattering many of its windows.\n\nDuring the February 1974 general election campaign, Liberal Leader Jeremy Thorpe was defending a wafer-thin majority of 369 votes in his Devon constituency. Instead of fighting a \"typical\" party leader's election campaign based in London and focusing on the London-based media, Thorpe spent almost the entire election in his constituency, keeping in contact with the national press via a live closed-circuit television link-up to daily press conferences at the National Liberal Club. Thorpe later credited this system with giving him more time to think of answers to questions, and it helped to keep the Liberal campaign both distinctive and modern. Further Liberal election campaigns of the 1970s and 1980s would retain the idea of a daily press conference at the NLC, but with live participants rather than a TV link-up to the party leader.\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, all London clubs were in serious decline, and the NLC was no exception. By the 1970s the club was in a serious state of disrepair, its membership dwindling, and its finances losing almost a thousand pounds a week. In 1976 Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe handed over the club to Canadian businessman George Marks, styling himself George de Chabris (and, more improbably, \"His Serene Holiness the Prince de Chabris\", which he claimed was \"a Catholic title\"), who, unknown to Thorpe, was a confidence trickster. \"De Chabris\" claimed to be a multi-millionaire willing to funnel money into the club (although both his wealth and his willingness to finance the club turned out to be untrue), and he spent nine months running the club, relaxing membership rules and bringing in more income, but also moving his family in rent-free, running several fraudulent businesses from its premises, paying for a sports car and his children's private school fees from the club's accounts, and he eventually left in a hurry owing the club £60,000, even emptying out the cash till of the day's takings as he went. He eventually agreed to pay back half of that sum in instalments. In his time at the club he also sold it a painting for £10,000, when it was valued at less than £1,000. One of his more controversial reforms was to sell the National Liberal Club's Gladstone Library (which contained the largest library of 17th- to 20th-century political material in the country, including 35,000 books and over 30,000 pamphlets) to the University of Bristol for £40,000. The pretext given was that the club could no longer afford to pay the Librarian's wages, and that it did not want to leave such valuable material unguarded. Ian Bradley described it as \"a derisory sum\" for the sale, particularly in light of the unique collection of accumulated candidates' manifestos from 19th-century general elections. Until its sale, it had been, as Peter Harris observed, \"The most extensive of the Club libraries of London.\" The collection is still housed at Bristol today. However, the papers referring to the history of the club itself were returned to the NLC in the 1990s, as they had not been included in the sale, and had been sent to Bristol by accident.\n\nAfter the 1977 dismissal of de Chabris, a 1978 rescue package by Sir Lawrence Robson (a former Liberal Party President and parliamentary candidate, co-founder and partner of Robson Rhodes, and husband of Liberal peer Baroness Robson) did much to stabilise the club and secure its future – to this day the club honours Sir Lawrence with a portrait in the Smoking Room, and one of its function rooms has been renamed the Lawrence Robson Room.\n\nAs the Liberal Party's lease on its headquarters expired in 1977, the party organisation moved to the upper floors of the NLC, the negotiations being arranged by \"de Chabris\". The Liberals occupied a suite of rooms on the second floor, and a series of offices converted from bedrooms on the upper floors. The party continued to operate from the NLC until 1988, when it merged with the Social Democratic Party to form the Liberal Democrats, and moved to occupy the SDP's old headquarters in Cowley Street. During this time, party workers were known to avail themselves of the club downstairs, and the NLC bar became known as the \"Liberal Party's 'local'\" and a Liberal Party song \"Down at the Old NLC\" was written in response to this:\n\nIn the autumn of 1980, former Liberal Leader Jo Grimond delivered the inaugural 'Eighty Club' lecture to the Association of Liberal Lawyers at the club, drawing press attention for his scathing criticism of those Liberals who believed that their future lay in some form of social democracy, or what he termed, \"a better yesterday\".\n\nIn 1985, the club undertook a two-year negotiation to sell off its second-floor and basement function rooms, and the 140 bedrooms from the third floor to the eighth floor (including two vast ballrooms and the Gladstone Library, which had contained 35,000 volumes before their sale in 1977, and was standing empty by the 1980s) to the adjoining Royal Horseguards Hotel, which is approached from a different entrance, and which has operated as a hotel since 1971. This was not without some dissent among the membership, but the sale ensured that the club's financial future was secure, and the remaining part of the club still operating, mainly on the ground and first floors of the vast building, still remains one of the largest clubhouses in the world. Originally built for 6,000 members, the club still provides facilities for around 2,000.\n\nThe club's calendar includes an Annual Whitebait Supper, where members depart by river from Embankment Pier, downstream to The Trafalgar, the Greenwich tavern which Gladstone used to take his cabinet ministers to by boat; as well as the Political and Economic Circle, which was founded by Gladstone in the 1890s.\n\nOn 17 July 2002, Jeremy Paxman gave a well-publicised interview with Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy in the club's Smoking Room for an edition of \"Newsnight\". The interview generated much controversy over Paxman's querying Kennedy's alcohol intake, including his asking, \"Does it trouble you that every single politician to whom we've spoken in preparing for this interview said the same thing – 'You're interviewing Charles Kennedy, I hope he's sober'?\" It was the first time a major television interview had raised the topic with the Lib Dem leader, who would resign three and half years later after admitting to suffering from alcoholism.\n\nIn the 2006 Liberal Democrats leadership election, Chris Huhne launched his leadership campaign from the main staircase of the club, while in the 2007 Liberal Democrats leadership election, frontrunner and eventual winner Nick Clegg launched his successful leadership bid from the club's David Lloyd George Room, praising \"the elegance of the National Liberal Club\". As party leader, Clegg has delivered further landmark addresses at the club, such as his \"muscular liberalism\" speech of 11 May 2011, marking one year of the Liberal Democrats in power as part of the Conservative-led coalition government.\n\nDesigned by leading Victorian architect Alfred Waterhouse using the Renaissance Revival architecture style, the clubhouse was constructed at a cost of some £165,950; a substantial sum in 1884, worth a little over £15 million in 2014. An earlier design by architect John Carr was rejected by members.\n\nThe NLC was described by \"Munsey's Magazine\" in 1902 as possessing, \"The most imposing clubhouse in the British metropolis\", and at the time of its construction, it was the largest clubhouse ever built; only the subsequent Royal Automobile Club building from 1910 was larger. The NLC's building once hosted its own branch of the Post Office, something which the Royal Automobile Club still does. Waterhouse's design blended French, Gothic and Italianate elements, with heavy use of Victorian Leeds Burmantofts Pottery tilework manufactured by Wilcox and Co. The clubhouse is built around load-bearing steelwork concealed throughout the structure, including steel columns inside the tiled pillars found throughout the club. (It was this resilient structure which enabled the building to survive a direct hit in the Blitz.) Waterhouse's work extended to designing the club's furnishings, down to the Dining Room chairs.\n\nIt was the first London building to incorporate a lift, and the first to be entirely lit throughout by electric lighting. To provide its electricity, the Whitehall Supply Co. Ltd. was incorporated in 1887, being based underneath the club's raised terrace. By the time the supply opened in 1888, it had been bought by the expanding Metropolitan Electricity Supply Co. NLC members were so enamoured with the modern wonder of electric lighting that the original chandeliers featured bare light bulbs, whose distinctive hue was much prized at the time.\n\nThe club's wine cellar was converted from a trench dug in 1865, intended to be the Waterloo and Whitehall Railway, stretching from Scotland Yard to Waterloo station, which planned to carry freight that would have been powered by air pressure; digging was abandoned in 1868, and when the company wound up in 1882, the National Liberal Club adapted the tunnel to its present use.\n\nOver the years, numerous Liberal and Liberal Democrat MPs have lived at the club, including David Lloyd George in the 1890s, Cyril Smith in the 1970s and Menzies Campbell in the late 1980s.\n\nThe club has had a number of members who were notable authors, including Rupert Brooke, G. K. Chesterton, Jerome K. Jerome, George Bernard Shaw, Bram Stoker, Dylan Thomas, H. G. Wells and Leonard Woolf; several of whom featured the club in some of their works of literature.\n\nAdditionally, the Authors' Club, founded in 1891 in neighbouring Whitehall Court, lodged with the National Liberal Club between 1966 and 1976, and has done so again since 2014.\n\n\n\nThe NLC is a private members' club, with membership needing the nomination of an existing member, and a waiting period of at least one month. Members are in one of two categories: either Members, who sign a declaration that they shall not use the club's facilities or their membership for 'political activities adverse to Liberalism', or Political Members, who sign the same declaration, plus an additional declaration that they are a Liberal in their politics, in exchange for additional voting rights within the club. Non-political Membership was first introduced in 1932, to allow Liberals to join when they had been barred up until that point, as several occupations such as judges, army officers and senior civil servants specifically forbade political declarations.\n\nIt is one of the few London clubs to contain another club within—since 1990, the NLC has also been home to the Savage Club, which lodges in some rooms on the ground floor.\n\nIn return for a collective subscription, members of the Old Millhillian's Club (OMC) have also been allowed to use the NLC clubhouse since 1968, when their own neighbouring Whitehall Court clubhouse closed down.\n\nIn keeping with its liberal roots, it was one of the first gentlemen's club to allow ethnic minorities as members (a handful of other clubs did so as well, including the East India Club whose members included Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy). The first recorded ethnic minority member of the NLC, Dadabhai Naoroji was admitted in 1885, when the club was less than three years old, and spurred on by Club Secretary William Digby, by the late 1880s, the club had a large overseas membership, particularly concentrated in India and among Indian nationals resident in London. Henry Sylvester Williams, the Trinidadian lawyer, pan-Africanist, and Progressive Party Marylebone councillor, was a member Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the first Governor General of Pakistan, and a successful barrister, was a member of the National Liberal Club.\n\nSince the club's 1882 foundation, women had always been allowed to use the club as visitors, but remained barred from membership until the 1960s, when it became one of the first \"gentlemen's clubs\" to admit women members. It offered women an 'associate membership' category from 1967 until 1976. The Lady Associate membership referendum was submitted for adoption by the General Committee in June 1967. The first five applications for Lady Associate Members were approved by the Membership Committee in November 1967. \"Number of lady associate members elected, or applying, at 19 January 1968\" was 34. One of the early Lady Associate Members was Miss. V.E. Wilcox, approved by the Membership Committee in March 1968. Lady Associate members initially had to be the wife or widow of a member of NLC. In 1969, women who were not related by family relationships to a male member could be nominated as Lady Associate Member, paying a higher membership fee to a Lady Associate member who is a wife or widow of a member. Both types of Lady Associate member fees were still lower than male members' membership fees because of restricted privileges of Lady Associate members. Other early Lady Associate members included Violet Bonham Carter and Nancy Seear.\n\nIt did not admit women as full members until 1976, although this did still make it the first major London club to admit women, while many other such clubs did not admit women until the 1990s or 2000s (and several still do not). The next major London club to admit women was the Reform Club, in 1981. The club's first full women members in 1976 were Christina Baron and Joyce Arram.\n\nWhen the club was originally launched in 1882, like every other London club of the era it had no prescriptive dress code. In 1888, a simple requirement was introduced that \"No member shall appear in any public rooms of the Club in a dressing gown, slippers, or other \"deshabille\".\" Beyond that, the club's only dress code was a request in the Regulations that members \"dress and conduct themselves in a manner consistent with civilised standards\", but precisely how members chose to observe that remained a matter of considerable personal interpretation. Indeed, the club's first official history, in 1925, noted that an unusual feature of the NLC was the way in which it enjoyed far more casual dress than other London clubs, with members turning up in their working clothes, and it singled out, \"the practical tabooing of evening dress, which assisted in securing the attendance of the House of Commons and Press Gallery men for at least part of the social evening.\" This absence of any prescriptive dress code remained the club's \"modus operandi\" from 1882 until 1979, when the Club's flurry of recent scandals led the General Committee to impose a strict jacket-and-tie dress code for men, emulating the jacket-and-tie dress codes introduced in other London clubs in the 1950s, which the NLC had previously held out against. No vote of the membership was held on the new dress code.\n\nThis strict jacket-and-tie dress code remained in place for 40 years after the General Committee's 1979 decision, although a 2005 review led the club to permit men to remove their jackets on the club's terrace.\n\nIn May 2018, the Club's Annual General Meeting voted by 49 to 36 in favour of a trial relaxation of the dress code in July and August of that year, removing the jacket-and-tie requirement from every part of the club except the Dining Room. It was the first time in 39 years that members had been permitted a formal vote on the dress code. At the following AGM in May 2019, the dress code was more permanently relaxed, by 80 votes to 19. \nThe club has been used as a location in numerous films and television programmes, including:\n\n\nOver the years the NLC has contained a large number of notable members. In addition to many politicians, including seven Prime Ministers – five Liberals from Gladstone to Lloyd George, one Labour (Ramsay MacDonald) and one Conservative (Winston Churchill), its membership has also contained a sizeable literary element, with writers including Rupert Brooke, G. K. Chesterton, John Creasey, Jerome K. Jerome, George Newnes, C. P. Scott, George Bernard Shaw, Bram Stoker, Edgar Wallace, H. G. Wells and Leonard Woolf.\n\nBesides the members, famous guests who have signed the Visitors' Book over the years have included Tony Benn, Mahatma Gandhi, Field Marshal Montgomery, and Harold Wilson.\n\n\n\n\nThe club is open to members from Mondays to Fridays, 8:00am–11:30 pm. During the weekend members may use either the Oxford and Cambridge Club in Pall Mall, or the Naval and Military Club and the East India Club in St. James's Square. The club's link with the latter relates to the East India incorporating the now-defunct Devonshire Club, which was another Liberal-affiliated club of the 19th century. There are also reciprocal arrangements with over 160 other clubs worldwide, granting members a comfortable place to stay and to entertain when abroad. The club does not affiliate with the NULC (National Union of Liberal Clubs), which represents the interests of Liberal Working Men's Clubs in the country nationwide.\n\nAs of 2020, the NLC's reciprocal clubs around the world are as follows (club foundation dates are provided in brackets):\n\n†=died in office\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2320828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320828", "title": "Superlópez", "text": "Superlópez\n\nSuperlópez is a Spanish comic book character created by Jan. Created in 1973, Superlópez is a parody of Superman. Born \"Jo-Con-Él\" (translated as \"Damn-with-him\") on the planet \"Chitón\" (Spanish slang meaning something like \"Shut up!\") much like Superman's home planet of Krypton, he leaves his planet when he enters a spaceship and presses a button, an accident that sends him to Earth. He was raised by adoptive parents in Barcelona and concealed himself under the identity of office-worker \"Juan López\" (which is actually author Jan's real name). He works with his girlfriend, the bad-tempered \"Luisa Lanas\", the not-so-pally \"Jaime González Lidenbrock\"; and his demanding, unnamed boss.\n\nThis was revealed in the 8-page origin story in the first issue of his magazine. Other stories in the first issue reveal his \"Fortress of Solitude\", the \"Villa Soledad\" in the Arctic and have him fighting a rubber robot, the Galactic Gladiator, a sorceress from another dimension, La Incredible Maza (The Incredible Hulk), an atomic monster and a metal robot.\nOther recurring characters include \"Inspector Hólmez\" (a reference to Sherlock Holmes), an excessively bureaucratic police officer who suspects everyone; \"Martha Hólmez\", the Inspector's daughter, and computer geek \"Chico Humitsec\".\n\nIn 1973, cartoonist Juan López Fernández \"Jan\" was commissioned to produce a book of very short comic strips parodying Superman. Antonio Martín, then editorial director of the comic book area of the Barcelona publisher Euredit and responsible for the commission, had to convince Jan -who did not consider himself a comedian- to do the job, and he did it quickly, without much faith. The work was included in the collection Humor siglo XX, edicated to the satire of characters from comic books, literature and American cinema, such as King Kong, Tarzan or Frankenstein. The comics had to be silent, printed in black and white and in a 48-page landscape format, so, to overcome these creative restrictions, the author resorted to all kinds of graphic resources, such as thought snacks, kinetic signs or accentuation of expressions, with which he achieved great expressiveness in his drawings.\n\nJan conceived his parody of Superman in the manner of an ordinary Spaniard, \"in the key of a tacky marriage\" because it seemed to him to be the closest thing to the public at the time. This character, faced with the daily difficulties that he cannot solve and which frustrate him, adopts as an escape valve the tactic of imagining that he is a superhero. The jokes corresponding to this volume, traced with rotring lines on sheets of folio paper and with an extension of up to four vignettes, have a simple and expressive line drawing, and present -despite the limitations of the format and the fact that they maintain little connection or continuity between them- effect gags on Superman, rather \"domestic\" mute jokes, which have little to do with the character later developed in the Superlópez comics of Ediciones B.\nRecurring villains include the evil professor \"Escariano Avieso\"; \"Lady Araña\" (“Lady Spider”); the gangster \"Al Trapone\" (a reference to Al Capone; he is accompanied by goons like \"Carasucia\", \"Caracortada\", \"Carapincho\", gun-wielding \"Pistolet\", etc.); and the mob boss \"Refuller D'Abastos\".\n\nIn Issue No. 2 and 3 (“El Supergrupo”), Superlópez served as a member of a group of superheroes, all of which were Jan's creations. These included \"El Mago\" (\"The Wizard\", a parody of Dr. Strange); \"Capitán Hispania\" (\"Captain Spain\", a parody of Captain America); \"Latas\" (\"Tin-guy\", a parody of Iron Man); \"Bruto\" (\"The Brute\", a parody of The Thing); and \"la Chica Increíble\" (\"Incredible Girl\", a parody of the token generic superheroine). These spent more time fighting one another over the leadership of the Supergrupo than fighting evil (a parody or reference from the internecine strife that is part of Spain's history). They also made a short appearance in issue 6 where instead of going after the outlawed Superlopez, they argue then fight each other. The Supergroup come back in book 63, where a scientist is altering reality. In book 69, the Supergrupo meet Los Ligiones Justicieros, DC's JLA, featuring parodies of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and Aquaman.\n\nSuperlópez began his career as a half-page comic strip without text then whole page strips with text where things for López normally ended up badly (reprinted in issue 13, The Genesis of Superlópez), before expanding into full albums which were later put together into annuals holding a number of issues, with adventures involving supervillains and criminal organizations, later evolving into longer, more complex stories concerning social topics affecting contemporary Spain (drug dealing and youth, political issues, pollution and environmental threats, etc.). Original writer \"Efepé\" (pseudonym of Francisco Pérez Navarro) left the character after the early issues and, from that point on, artist Jan took over the writing as well.\n\nJuan travels around the world after stories with Luisa and Jaime and encounters lost races, treasures and so on. He also encountered assorted aliens, monsters, robots, mad scientists, wars, Aztec gods and even had a trip to Hell. The stories are full of gags with him burning his large nose whenever he uses heat vision, of him getting a bump on the head when Luisa hits him, of him hurting his fist when he hits a metal robot. As well as bees, odd-looking little yellow creatures feature in the background in some panels and are revealed as ectoplasms in the \"Los Petisos Carambanales\" story. He even becomes a popstar and meets the ghost of the Prado Museum. Nothing was too way out for the strips as the characters went from one crazy scenario to another.\n\nOften Superlópez not only parodies Superman but also popular literature. This is the case in \"El Señor de los Chupetes\" (\"Lord of the Pacifiers\", a parody for Lord of the Rings) or \"Al centro de la Tierra\" (after Jules Verne's A Journey to the Center of the Earth)\n\nFrom the 1990s Superlópez adventures take place in real scenarios that are drawn using a realistic style. Famous buildings and monuments in Barcelona are often portrayed in detail, as well as those in other cities of Catalonia (Camprodon), Europe (Andorra, Grenoble, Bulgaria) or Japan. As an internal joke, Superlópez says once that his adventures are evolving into simple traveling guides.\n\nSuperlópez later often had science fiction stories like \"Tú, robot...\" (53) where an intelligent robot is created which then travels the world, unintentionally doing good and bad as it seeks to find out what it means to be human. Confronting the robot in the icy wastes, like in the original Frankenstein story, Superlópez is not sure what humanity is either. In \"El virus Frankenstein\" (56) a virus changes a young boy into a horrible monster while the \"El mundo de al lado\" (57) features a door to another dimension where maybe based on a Little Prince story, the people are enslaved into pulling huge wagons around the planet and \"Elecciones en Kaxim\" (58) feature him interfering in elections on a strange alien world. In book 62, Superlópez goes near a beam giant aliens use to cut planets up and his left arm is cut off at the elbow. It suddenly reattaches itself a few pages later and is normal again.\n\nIn book 64, \"The Time Thief\", Superlópez meets Doctor Who with his Tardis, the Daleks and the Cybermen. In book 66, the \"super group\" go to the Skroll (Marvel Skrulls) planet and also borrowed some of the story line from Fantastic Four 24 (March 1964). The book deals with hospital overcrowding too.\n\nLater Superlópez books leave the caricaturesque tone of his first adventures to deal with current social issues: illegal drug trade, smuggling, tax haven, gunrunning in Africa, dictatorships, or illegal immigration in Europe are some later themes. Book 69 deals with the illegally built Algarrobico hotel in Almeria, southern Spain. Book 70 deals with Muslim radicalisation of youngsters and extremism, a subject few others dare to touch.\n\n\n\nThere is a 2003 short animation film named \"Superlópez contra el robot de bolsillo\" by Enrique Gato, the creator of \"Tadeo Jones\". A feature length Spanish film \"Superlópez\" was released on November 23, 2018 \n\n\n"}

He played the voice of Nightscream in \"Beast Machines\", he was also the voice of Julian in \"Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper\", a Barbie movie based on the Mark Twain story \"The Prince and the Pauper\", in which he also performed his own singing; he also voiced the merman prince Nalu in \"\" and \"\", and most recently did both the speaking and singing role of Prince Antonio in \"Barbie as the Island Princess\". He was also in the movie \"Barbie Mariposa\" as \"Prince Carlos\" and \"\" as River. He also voices the character Koji in the English version of \"Ōban Star-Racers\". Made his TV debut at age 11 in the MacGyver episode \"The Madonna. He also played two minor roles in \"Stargate SG-1\" as Eliam in the Season 4 episode \"Scorched Earth\" and Katep in Season 8's finale episodes \"Moebius: Part 1 and 2\". He voices the character L in the anime series \"Death Note\" and its dubbed live action counterpart. He was also in the two-night Syfy event \"Alice\" as the 9 of Clubs. He appeared in the web series \"Riese\" as Garin. He played a small role as \"Druid\" in the TV series \"Dark Angel\".\n\nIn addition to his television and film work, Juliani frequently appears on stage, both in Vancouver (where he has earned multiple nominations and wins for Vancouver theatre's Jessie Awards) and elsewhere. In Vancouver, he has been in productions staged by Bard on the Beach, Vancouver Playhouse, and the Vancouver Opera. Further afield, he has appeared in the Aldeburgh Festival in England and the Orlando Shakespeare Festival.\n\nIn 2003, the 1978 television series, \"Battlestar Galactica\" was brought back to the small screen in what was termed a \"reimagined\" form, as a three-hour miniseries. The project was written and produced by Ronald D. Moore and directed by Michael Rymer. Alessandro Juliani starred as Felix Gaeta, a lieutenant in the Colonial Fleet. The miniseries effectively served as pilot for a potential TV series which was later commissioned in a collaborative effort between the Sci Fi Channel and Sky TV (the British broadcaster). \"Battlestar Galactica\" (2004–2009) was filmed mostly in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nIn the episode \"Guess What's Coming to Dinner?\", Alessandro's vocal skills were featured prominently. His character's singing is explained as a method of dealing with the pain of a severe physical injury. His voice is heard often when flashing through other scenes and characters.\n\nIn March 2009, Juliani won the Streamy Award for Best Male Actor in a Dramatic Web Series for his work in the webisode, \"\".\n\nJuliani sings in \"Gaeta's Lament\", the first track of the \"Battlestar Galactica\" Season 4 soundtrack.\n\nJuliani had a small part in the 2009 movie \"Watchmen\", as a Rockefeller Military Base Technician.

The species is endemic to the Western Palearctic.\n\nThe following 14 subspecies are recognized as being valid.\n\n\nA trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than \"Emys\".\n\nThe subspecific name \"eiselti\" is in honor of Viennese herpetologist Josef Eiselt (1912–2001).\n\nThe subspecific name \"fritzjuergenobsti\" is in honor of German herpetologist Fritz Jürgen Obst (1939–2018).\n\nThe subspecific name \"lanzai\" is in honor of Italian herpetologist .\n\n\"E. orbicularis\" is found in southern and central Europe, West Asia and North Africa. In the early post-glacial period, the European pond turtle had a much wider distribution, being found as far north as southern Sweden. It became extinct in Great Britain due to climate change.\n\nIn France, there are six large remaining populations, all deteriorating; it is the most endangered reptile of the country.\n\nIn Switzerland, the European pond turtle was extinct at the beginning of the twentieth century and reintroduced since 2010.\n\n\"E. orbicularis\" prefers to live in wetlands surrounded by a large proportion of natural, wooded, landscape. It also feeds in upland environments. It is usually considered semi-aquatic, as its terrestrial movements can span , and it is occasionally found travelling up to , away from the water.\n\nHistorically, \"E. orbicularis\" had been maintained as pets; however, this practice has been restricted due to protection laws. Ownership of wild caught specimens is prohibited. Only registered captive bred specimens may be owned by private individuals. Due to human impact, the European pond turtle has been found to be relocated in areas distant from its origin. However, it is possible to localize and indicate a region of origin with genetic testing.\n\nThe European pond turtle is a medium-sized turtle, and its straight carapace length varies quite a bit across its geographic range, from . The carapace is dark brown to blackish, with a hint of green. The head and legs are spotted with yellow. The plastron is yellowish.\n\nAn important factor that affects the development of \"E. orbicularis\" is temperature and thermal conditions. It has been reported that differential growth rates of the same species occur, including variation of body size and clutch size, because of varying temperatures in certain areas. Due to evident patterns of sexual dimorphism, \"E. orbicularis\" adult males are always found to be smaller than females. In males, smaller plastra offer them a wider mobility compared to females. In females, due to their differential diet and foraging habits, there may be a correlation to an adaptive effect on their skull and head morphology.\n\n\"E. orbicularis\" eats a mixed diet of plants and animal matter that can increase the efficiency of its digestive process. It has been reported that an adult's diet starts from a carnivorous diet and progresses to a more herbivorous diet as it ages and grows in size. This is similar to other omnivore emydid turtles. As \"E. orbicularis\" grows in age and becomes an adult, the amount of plant material consumption increases during the post breeding period. \"E. orbicularis\" may prefer less energetic food after the breeding season, a period of time where most of its energy is spent to recover from reproduction.\n\nMost freshwater turtles lay their eggs on land, typically near a water body, but some species of \"Emys\" have been found to lay their eggs distances less than from water. The search of a nesting areas by adult females can last several hours to more than one day. Once the location of the nest is established, females spend time for the construction of the nest, laying of the eggs, and closing the nest which can take up to another 4 hours.\n\nNest fidelity is a characteristic that female European pond turtles carry out by selecting a nesting site based on its ecological characteristics and then return there for future expeditions so long as the site has not changed. \"E. orbicularis\" females tend to change to another nesting site if there are visible changes to the present environment or because of dietary changes. If an \"E. orbicularis\" female must change from nest to nest, it will typically select a site in close proximity. In addition, females can also lay eggs in an abandoned nesting site if the conditions change to become better suited for egg survival. If the ecological characteristics of the nesting site changes, this may influence the survival of the hatchlings and their sex ratio. Due to ecological changes such as trees growing to shade the nest, this can change the environment into an inadequate location for egg incubation. Females that do not exhibit nesting fidelity and lay eggs in the same area for long periods of time, even with the ecological changes, may produce large proportions of males as vegetation grows and nesting areas become more shaded. Since the sex of these turtles is temperature-dependent, a change in temperature may produce a larger number of males or females which may upset the sex ratio.\n\nClimate has an effect on the survival of \"E. orbicularis\" hatchlings. Hatchlings are only able to survive under favorable weather conditions, but due to regular annual clutch sizes and long lifespan, \"E. orbicularis\" adults, along with many freshwater turtles, balance out loss of hatchlings due to climate.\n\nThe species \"E. orbicularis\" has become rare in most countries even though it is widely distributed in Europe. The building of roads and driving of cars through natural habitats is a possible factor that threatens the populations of the European pond turtle. Road networks and traffic often carry complex ecological effects to animal populations such as fragmenting natural habitats and creating barriers for animal movement. Mortality on the road is most likely due to females selecting nests near roads which places a potential danger for the hatchlings as well. Hatchlings that wander too closely to roads are more likely to be killed and put the future population in danger. Although the possibility of roads being a major causation for the mortality of \"E. orbicularis\" is a rare phenomenon, long-term monitoring is necessary.\n\nIntroduced exotic species such as \"Trachemys scripta scripta\" and \"T. s. elegans\", known commonly as Florida turtles, also put in danger the native \"Emys\" species in many parts of Spain (and possibly in other parts of southern Europe), since these exotic turtles are bigger and heavier than the native pond turtles. The usual life span of \"E. orbicularis\" is 40–60 years. It can live over 100 years, but such longevity is very rare and unusual.\n\n\"E. orbicularis\" hosts several species of parasites, including \"Haemogregarina stepanovi\", monogeneans of the genus \"Polystomoides\", vascular trematodes of the genus \"Spirhapalum\", and many nematode species.\n\n\n\n"}

Unlike most lettuces, it is tolerant of heat. In North America, romaine is sold as whole heads or as “hearts” that have had the outer leaves removed and are often packaged together. \n\nCommercially sold romaine lettuce has occasionally been the subject of product warnings by both U.S. and Canadian health authorities warning that consumer supplies can become contaminated with or host bacteria. Cattle can harbor the bacteria without ill effects, and be asymptomatic carriers of the bacterium. Lettuce becomes contaminated with the bacterium as the result of cattle manure being used to fertilize crop fields, or the proximity of cattle pastures and feedlots to water sources used to irrigate crops. \n\nIn British English, it is commonly known as “cos” lettuce, and in North American English as “romaine” lettuce. Many dictionaries trace the word \"cos\" to the name of the Greek island of Cos, from which the lettuce was presumably introduced. Other authorities trace \"cos\" to the Arabic word for lettuce, \"\" .\n\nIt apparently reached Western Europe via Rome, as it is called \"lattuga romana\" in Italian and \"\" in French, both meaning “Roman lettuce”. Hence the name “romaine”, the common term in North America.\n\nFor 3000 years (from at least 2700 BC), lettuce was associated with the ancient Egyptian god of fertility, Min, for its resemblance to the phallus.\n\nRomaine lettuce may be used in the Passover Seder as a type of bitter herb. It symbolises the bitterness inflicted by the Egyptians while the Israelites were slaves in Egypt.\n\nRomaine is a common salad green, and is the usual lettuce used in Caesar salad. Romaine lettuce is commonly used in Middle Eastern cuisine. Romaine, like other lettuces, may also be cooked. For example, it can be braised or made into soup. The thick ribs, especially on the older outer leaves, should have a milky fluid that gives the romaine its typically bitter herb taste.\n\nIn North American supermarkets, romaine is widely available year-round.\n\nAs with other dark leafy greens, the antioxidants found in romaine lettuce are believed to help prevent cancer.\n\nFrom November 2017 through January 2018, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHA) identified romaine as being linked to illness in 41 persons in Canada. A probably related outbreak affected 25 people in 15 states of the U.S. who ate leafy greens, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were unable to confirm that it was romaine in particular. There was one death. The disease agent was Shiga toxin-producing . The most recent illness started on December 12, 2017; the PHA declared the outbreak over on January 10, 2018, and the CDC declared it over on January 25.\n\nIn response to another \"E. coli\" O157:H7 outbreak, which probably began in mid-March 2018, the CDC recommended in April 2018 that consumers not buy or eat romaine lettuce unless they could confirm it was not from the Yuma, Arizona, growing region. On May 22, 2018, after a month-long warning, the CDC announced it was now safe to consume romaine again. The outbreak killed five people and caused 89 hospitalizations across 32 states.\n\nIn June 2018, the FDA traced the source of the latest \"E. coli\" outbreak to water from a canal located in Yuma, Arizona.\n\nIn November 2018, the US CDC and the PHA of Canada issued a warning to consumers that romaine lettuce should not be consumed in any form, and that they should dispose of any currently on hand. The same strain of \"E. coli\" identified in the 2017-2018 outbreak was implicated. At least 43 people became ill in this outbreak, which the FDA traced to one of six counties in Central California: Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz and Ventura. As of January 9, 2019, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has declared the most recent \"Escherichia coli\" O157:H7 outbreak linked to California grown romaine lettuce over. \n\nMany US growers of romaine lettuce farm in Salinas in the summer and the Imperial Valley and Yuma in the winter, relying on day laborers crossing the border from Mexico.\n\nThe day of 22 Germinal in the French Republican Calendar was dedicated to this lettuce, as \"\".\n"}
{"id": "2320941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320941", "title": "Paul Winter Consort", "text": "Paul Winter Consort\n\nThe Paul Winter Consort is an American musical group, led by soprano saxophonist Paul Winter. Founded in 1967, the group mixes elements of jazz, classical music, world music, and the sounds of animals and nature. They are often classified as \"new age\" or \"ecological jazz\", and their musical style is often called \"Earth Music\". The group has had many lineup changes since it was founded. Long-standing members currently in the group include Paul Winter, cellist Eugene Friesen, bassist Eliot Wadiopan, jazz oboist Paul McCandless, and percussionist and frame drum specialist Glen Velez. Past members who were part of the group for a considerable length of time include Paul Halley, Susan Osborn, Oscar Castro-Neves, Russ Landau, David Darling, Jim Scott, Dorothy Papadakos, and Rhonda Larson.\n\nThe Paul Winter Consort was founded in 1967 by Paul Winter, who had already begun a promising career as a jazz saxophonist in the early sixties. After hearing the songs of humpback whales, he was inspired to create a new form of music which would bring together elements of music from around the world as well as animal songs, thus creating an “orchestra of the entire world”. This artistic message was in line with Winter's growing interest in environmentalism, animal rights, and pacifism. Winter got the name “consort” from musical groups of the middle ages and the Renaissance which combined the sounds of wind instruments, string instruments, and percussion – the same instruments Winter was interested in using.\n\nThe original lineup included Winter on alto and soprano saxophones, cellist Richard Bock, guitarists Karl Herreshoff and Gene Bertoncini, flautist Virgil Scott, double reed player Gene Murrow, and percussionist Ruth Ben-Zvi. The group was initially unsatisfied with recording in the stressful environment of a recording studio, and felt rushed to release albums due to the studio's schedules. The original band released their first and only album, \"The Winter Consort\", in 1968. The group suffered numerous lineup changes in its early stages. Its next album, \"Something In The Wind\", was released in 1969, and replaced Gene Murrow and Ruth Ben-Zvi with Paul McCandless and Steve Booker. Another new addition to the group was bassist John Beal. Karl Herreshoff and Gene Bertoncini only appeared on \"Something In The Wind\" as guests, along with five other musicians. The group's third album, \"Road\", was released in 1970, and saw further lineup changes. Winter and Paul McCandless were the only remaining members of the previous lineup, with Bock being replaced by David Darling, and Beal being replaced by Glen Moore. Other new additions were classical guitarist Ralph Towner and multi-instrumentalist Colin Walcott. This third album was of greater success than the first two, and had the unique honor of being brought to the moon by the astronauts on Apollo 15, who named two craters after the tracks \"Ghost Beads\" and \"Icarus.\" The bossa-nova flavored tune \"Icarus\" was written by Ralph Towner, and is arguably the Paul Winter Consort's most successful song. It has become the signature piece of both The Winter Consort and Ralph Towner, and was included in the standard lead sheet book known as \"The Real Book\".\n\n1971 saw the group have considerable success, and after replacing bassist Glen Moore with Herb Bushler, got the opportunity to create a new album and have it produced by George Martin, who had gained considerable fame from being the longtime producer of The Beatles. Martin gave the group many luxuries they were previously not used to. They were no longer rushed in and out of recording studios, stuck to the studio's schedules. They also didn't have to deal with the cramped space of the studio, with Martin suggesting they create the album in a rented house near the ocean. The Consort was encouraged to nourish its music and sense of community, and the end result was the landmark album \"Icarus\", which was released in 1972, which George Martin described as “the finest album I've ever made”. 1972 also saw the departure of many important members of the group: Towner, McCandless, and Walcott all left to focus on their own new group with former Consort bassist Glen Moore, called Oregon.\n\nThe group took a long hiatus from recording, and Winter spent much of his time further researching the idea of creating music with animals. These experiments culminated in his experimental 1978 solo album \"Common Ground\", which featured many members of the Consorts past, as well as many of the musicians that would shape the Paul Winter Consort in the future.\n\nAfter the release of the ground-breaking album \"Common Ground\", Winter founded Living Music, his own personal record label. Almost all of Winter's musical endeavors have since been released on the Living Music label. Having his own record label allowed him to take the time he desired to create his albums, and allowed him to create them using naturally acoustic spaces as opposed to the artificial acoustics of a recording studio.\n\nAnother new change came in 1979 when Winter and the Paul Winter Consort agreed to be the artists-in-residence at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. There, Winter met pianist and organist Paul Halley, who would become a performer and composer for the Paul Winter Consort for 20 years. Winter and his Consort began organizing many different events at the Cathedral, and in turn, the Cathedral allowed the use of its very reverberant sanctuary (with a measured seven seconds of reverberation time) and its organ for the creation of new albums. When Dorothy Papadakos succeeded Halley as Cathedral Organist in 1990, she teamed with the Paul Winter Concert for the Cathedral's festive Easter and Christmas services, \n\nThe Consort appeared on many of Winter's projects throughout the 1980s. With their new lineup of Paul Winter on soprano saxophone, Nancy Rumbel on oboe and English horn, Paul Halley on piano and organ, ground-breaking jazz cellist Eugene Friesen, Jim Scott on guitars, and world percussionist Ted Moore, the Consort recorded Winter's album \"Callings\", which further examined the possibility of creating music with wildlife. As a result of this album, March 1 was designated as the International Day of the Seal. It was also in 1980 that the first Summer Solstice and Winter Solstice celebrations were planned at the Cathedral, which have been an annual event since their creation. Another project taken on as a result of their position as artists-in-residence was the \"Missa Gaia/Earth Mass\", a contemporary mass which includes music from around the world and the use of the sounds of wolves, whales, and loons to create the melodies for each of the movements. The mass was completed and premiered in 1982, and featured a choir of 300, and vocalist Susan Osborn, a former member of the Consort.\n\nAnother first for Winter and his Consort came in 1985. Now including guitarist Oscar Castro-Neves and percussionist Glen Velez, the Consort took a number of rafting expeditions down the Colorado River, eventually recording the Paul Winter album \"Canyon\" in the inlets and side canyons of the Grand Canyon. The album was a new experiment, with Winter playing with the natural acoustics of the Grand Canyon. 1985 also marked the first release by the Paul Winter Consort since 1972: a live album recorded at the United Nations titled \"Concert For The Earth\". The concert was part of the 40th birthday celebration of the UN, and also was a landmark accomplishment for Winter. The concert featured a reunion consort of 12 musicians, with the addition of new Consort bassist Russ Landau, former member Susan Osborn, and guest musicians, including a 90 piece choir.\n\nBy 1987, the Consort had had another lineup change: Jim Scott had left the group, flautist Rhonda Larson became part of the group, and Neil Clark had joined as a percussionist. It was during this time that the group made a new connection: The Dmitri Pokrovsky Ensemble, a vocal group from Russia that was dedicated to the performance of traditional Russian folk music, had agreed to create an album with Winter. The milestone album, Earthbeat, was recorded in both New York City and Moscow, and was the first album of original music created by Americans and Russians together. This achievement came only a few years before the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the end of the Cold War.\n\nAn extended Paul Winter Consort of 18 musicians was also featured on Winter's 1990 album \"\". The album was a commissioned work to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, and was premiered in Times Square. 1990 also saw the group record a new album: \"The Man Who Planted Trees\". The album was a companion to the narration of the story of the same name by Jean Giono. The album featured Mark Perchanok on heckelphone. Another Paul Winter Consort album came in 1991: a live recording from the 1978 Paul Winter Consort and guests called \"Turtle Island\". This large piece also featured the poetry of Gary Snyder. Also in 1991, the Consort was featured as a backing band on Paul Halley's solo album \"Angel On A Stone Wall\".\n\nThe next record featured a lineup change once again, with Russ Landau replaced by bassist Eliot Wadiopan. The 1993 \"Spanish Angel\" was the group's first Grammy award-winning album (although some of Winter's albums which the Consort was featured on had won Grammy awards in the past decade). The album was the group's third live album, recorded during their 1992 tour of Spain.\n\nThe Consort took another long break from recording after their 1993 album \"Spanish Angel\". They still performed regularly in concert, and annually participated in Winter's annual Summer and Winter Solstice Celebrations. Many members of the Consort were featured as members of Paul Winter's Earth Band or appeared on other Winter solo albums. It was during this time that the Consort saw changes in a membership that had been stable for quite some time. Rhonda Larson left to concentrate on a solo career in 1993. Oscar Castro-Neves also chose to leave the group, still appearing as a guest artist on a regular basis. In 1998 an anthology album was released, \"Anthems\". Paul Halley left the group in 2000 to concentrate on his career as a choir director, organist, and composer. His successor, Dorothy Papadakos, teamed with the Paul Winter Consort for the Grammy award-winning album \"Silver Solstice\", released in 2005. The album was a two disc album of the live performance of the 25th Winter Solstice Celebration. As all Winter Solstice Celebrations do, it includes a large number of guest musicians, many of which had collaborated with Winter or his Consort in the past.\n\nAn album of new material from the Consort came in 2007: The Grammy award-winning album \"Crestone\". The album was recorded up in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, near the town of Crestone. It was another example of the group's interest in natural, and in some cases, challenging acoustic spaces. The album also marked the return of Consort veteran Paul McCandless. Also joining the group was Don Grusin. The newest album of music from the Consort was released in October 2010. The album, \"\", was commissioned by the Miho Museum in Japan. The album was recorded inside the corridors of the museum. It won the 2011 Grammy Award for Best New Age Album, the Consort's fourth Grammy win.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2320944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320944", "title": "Martial race", "text": "Martial race\n\nMartial race was a designation created by army officials of British India after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, where they classified each caste into one of two categories, 'martial' and 'non-martial'. The ostensible reason was that a 'martial race' was typically brave and well-built for fighting, while the 'non-martial races' were those whom the British believed to be unfit for battle because of their sedentary lifestyles. However, an alternative hypothesis is that British-trained Indian soldiers were among those who rebelled in 1857 and thereafter recruitment policy favoured castes which had remained loyal to the British and diminished or abandoned recruitment from the catchment area of the Bengal Army. The concept already had a precedent in Indian culture as one of the four orders (varnas) in the Vedic social system of Hinduism is known as the Kshatriya, literally \"warriors\". Brahmins were described as 'the oldest martial community', in the past having two of the oldest regiments, the 1st Brahmans and 3rd Brahmans.\n\nFollowing Indian independence, the Indian government in February 1949 abolished the official application of \"martial race\" principles with regard to military recruitment.\n\nPrior to 1857, the British were indifferent to many of the martial races such as the Gurkhas, who were of shorter stature in comparison to the more imposing upper-caste recruits of Awadh and Bihar. After the Rebellion of 1857, the previously separate Presidency armies, including the Bengal Army, were merged and the British attempted to search for whatever loyal factions remained. They found this in many of the groups that would be termed as \"martial races\".\nIn their attempts to assert control in India, the British faced fierce resistance in some regions while easily conquering others. British officials sought 'martial races' accustomed to hunting, or from agricultural cultures from hilly or mountainous regions with a history of conflict. Others were excluded due to their 'ease of living' or branded as seditious agitators. The doctrine of 'martial races' postulated that the qualities that make a useful soldier are inherited and that most Indians, with the exception of the specified groups, did not have the requisite traits that would make them warriors.\n\nThe British recruited heavily from the 'martial races' for service in the colonial army. Sensing the inequalities and fierce loyalty to one's tribe or group of the diverse native peoples of the subcontinent, the British found opportunities to use it to their own great advantage. These already wide divides were a fertile breeding ground to inculcate pride in one's identity based on 'race'. This served the British in two ways. On the one hand it made sure that there was no repetition of the rebellion of 1857 by ensuring there was no unity among the different subjects of the Raj. On the other hand, it encouraged a sense of competition among the different 'races'.\n\nBritish general and scholar Lieutenant-General Sir George MacMunn (1869–1952) noted in his writings \"It is only necessary for a feeling to arise that it is impious and disgraceful to serve the British, for the whole of our fabric to tumble like a house of cards without a shot being fired or a sword unsheathed\". To this end, it became British policy to recruit only from those tribes whom they classified as members of the 'martial races', and the practice became an integral part of the recruitment manuals for the Army in the British Raj. According to Jeffrey Greenhut, \"The Martial Race theory had an elegant symmetry. Indians who were intelligent and educated were defined as cowards, while those defined as brave were uneducated and backward.\"\n\nThe British regarded the 'martial races' as valiant and strong but also intellectually inferior, lacking the initiative or leadership qualities to command large military formations. They were also regarded as politically subservient or docile to authority. For these reasons, the martial races theory did not lead to officers being recruited from them; recruitment was based on social class and loyalty to the British Raj. One source calls this a \"pseudo-ethnological\" construction, which was popularised by Frederick Sleigh Roberts, and created serious deficiencies in troop levels during the World Wars, compelling them to recruit from 'non-martial races'. Winston Churchill was reportedly concerned that the theory was abandoned during the war and wrote to the Commander-in-Chief, India that he must, \"rely as much as possible on the martial races\". After Indian Independence, the Indian Army abandoned this theory and recruitment took place without discrimination.\n\nCritics of the theory state that the Indian rebellion of 1857 may have played a role in reinforcing the British belief in it. During this event the troops from the Bengal Native Infantry led by sepoy Mangal Pandey mutinied against the British. However, the loyal Pashtuns, Punjabis, Gurkhas, Kumaunis and Garhwalis did not join the mutiny, and fought on the side of the British Army. From then on, this theory was used to the hilt to accelerate recruitment from among these 'races', whilst discouraging enlistment of 'disloyal' troops and high-caste Hindus who had sided with the rebel army during the war.\n\nSome authors, such as Heather Streets, argue that the military authorities puffed up the images of the martial soldiers by writing regimental histories, and by extolling the kilted Scots, kukri-wielding Gurkhas and turbaned Sikhs in numerous paintings. Richard Schultz, an American author, has claimed the martial race concept as a supposedly clever British effort to divide and rule the people of India for their own political ends.\n\nThe hillmen—Kumaonis, Garhwalis, Dogras and Gorkhas—were initially a great impediment to the establishment of the British Empire, but once they gave their loyalty to the British they helped them greatly in their administration and were thus given the status of martial race. Kumaonis had helped the British in their efforts against the Gurkhas in the Nepal War. When they were observed by the British to be fighting on both sides—the British as well as the Gorkha side—their valour was given recognition by the British and they were included in the British Army. The 3rd Gorkha Rifles was known as the Kumaon battalion when it was formed, and included Kumaonis and Garhwalis along with the Gorkhas. The Kumaonis, once accepted as a martial race, were themselves to be recruited in the Hyderabad regiment and displace the native troops, ultimately becoming the Kumaon Regiment after the independence of India.\n\nBritish-declared martial races in the Indian subcontinent included some groups that were officially designated instead as \"agricultural tribes\" under the provisions of the Punjab Land Alienation Act of 1900. These terms were considered to be synonymous when the administration compiled a list in 1925. Among the communities listed as martial were:\n\n\nCommunities that were at various times classified as martial races include:\n\n\n\nThe recruitment of 'Madrassis' for infantry only took place during the Second World War when large numbers of troops were required to defend the British Empire in the form of a newly raised Madras Regiment. The Nairs of Kerala were initially included in the list, however after the Nairs of Travancore rebelled against the British under Velu Thampi Dalawa, they were recruited in lower numbers.\n\nThough seldom used in today's context, it has been alleged that the Pakistan Military believed in the concept of martial races, and thought that they would easily defeat India in a war, especially prior to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Based on this belief in martial supremacy. and thus numerical superiority of the foe could be overcome.\n\nThe Pakistan Army was also accused of bias and racism by the Bengalis of East Pakistan who felt humiliated by this dubious theory that was being floated in West Pakistan, that they were not 'martially inclined' compared to the Punjabis and Pashtuns. Pakistani author Hasan-Askari Rizvi notes that the limited recruitment of Bengali personnel in the Pakistan Army was because the West Pakistanis \"could not overcome the hangover of the martial race theory\".\n\nDefence writers in Pakistan have noted that the 1971 defeat was partially attributable to the flawed 'martial races' theory which led to wishful thinking that it was possible to defeat the Indian Army based on the theory alone. Author Stephen P. Cohen notes that \"Elevating the 'martial races' theory to the level of an absolute truth had domestic implications for Pakistani politics and contributed to the neglect of other aspects of security.\" Since then, the 'martial race' theory has rarely, if ever, been used by Pakistan.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "2320946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320946", "title": "Clumsy (Our Lady Peace album)", "text": "Clumsy (Our Lady Peace album)\n\nClumsy is the second studio album by the Canadian rock band Our Lady Peace, released on January 23, 1997 by Columbia Records. The album is the band's most successful to date, achieving diamond status in Canada (1 million units sold) and strong sales in other countries, including platinum status in the U.S. for another 1 million sales. In 2007, it ranked No. 76 on \"The Top 100 Canadian Albums\" by Bob Mersereau and No. 33 on The Top 102 New Rock Albums of All Time by 102.1 The Edge (in 2009). The album features five hit singles: \"Superman's Dead\", \"Automatic Flowers\", \"Clumsy\", \"4am\" and \"Carnival\". Each single has its own music video, with the exception of \"Carnival\".\n\nWhile on tour in support of \"Naveed\" the band attempted to begin writing for their next album. Like most bands, the challenges of writing a successful follow-up album was found to be difficult as each member now approached the writing process from a different set of experiences, personal goals, and influences from their time spent touring. Collaborations between band members and the co-writing producer broke down and writing sessions at the producer's studio resulted in nothing of use. The decision was made by Raine Maida that the way to resolve the situation was to change the line-up. It was either Mike Turner or Chris Eacrett. The concern then turned to what challenges would be faced with the task of replacing either. With Turner threatening legal recourse and Maida's school friend Duncan Coutts a bass player in his own band, the choice was simple. Immediately following the band's opening stint with Van Halen, Coutts was asked to join the band to be its new permanent bass player. \"I don't want to call our old bass player Chris a weak link...I think he's a talented musician, just different from us.\" claimed Maida at the time of the announcement. Turner would be later fired from the group in the first week of writing with producer Bob Rock (Aerosmith, Metallica, Bon Jovi, Motley Crue) on a subsequent album.\n\nAs touring continued, the band began writing again with Duncan. One of the first songs they wrote was the eventual concert favorite \"Trapeze\", which they played live along with two other newly written songs \"Home\" and \"Disgusted\". \"Disgusted\" would evolve into \"Spider Gun\" and eventually became the track \"Big Dumb Rocket\". In December 1995 the band began intensive writing and demoing sessions in a rented rehearsal space. Despite coming up with several new ideas, the band found that writing while on tour was very difficult because they couldn't give the songs their undivided attention and most of their early ideas were scrapped because the band wasn't satisfied with them. \"Trapeze\" would make it to recording but the track was eventually cut and has yet to be released.\n\nPre-production for the album was set to begin in January 1996. Producer Arnold Lanni noticed the band's discontent with the songs they were writing. \"I went down to see them and knew it wasn't happening\", he recalled. \"All their friends and family were calling them up. You sell that many records, you're on everybody's A-list, everybody blows sunshine up your butt and sometimes you believe the hype. We had to pull the plug on that scenario.\" At Lanni's suggestion, the band and him traveled to Duncan's rural lakeside cottage near Muskoka, Ontario, in order to concentrate on writing and recording demos for the album without distractions from family, friends or the media. While there, the band lived together in the cottage surrounded by instruments. A tape recorder was left on in the house all day to pick up any ideas being played. Lanni and the band members would usually play ice hockey in the afternoon and collaborate on songs in the evening and into the night. By the end of their stay, around 20 songs had been written. When they returned to the Toronto studio in February, according to Mike Turner, \"When we came back to record, it just came together\".\n\nRecording sessions for the yet untitled album began on February 8, 1996. The band was asked to record the Beatles song \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" for the soundtrack to the upcoming movie \"The Craft\" after several bands they had played with on tour knew them to play it well live. The song was recorded on the very first day of recording with Arnold Lanni and was mixed by Ralph Sall for the soundtrack. They then proceeded to pare down the twenty tracks they had written to the twelve they wanted to record. \"The Story of 100 Aisles\", originally called \"Anacin\", was the first song recorded and has a sound closer to \"Naveed\" than any other song on the album. \"We just wanted to go in and give all these songs ideas their own life and play with them and rearrange them and all that until we're completely happy with it.\" said Duncan Coutts, \"If they sound just like \"Naveed\" or if they don't, it wasn't a huge concern. We just wanted to make each song the best it could be.\"\n\nThe album was recorded in two parts. Five or six tracks were recorded and finished by April 1996 so the band could review them. These included the base tracks for \"Clumsy\", \"Hello Oskar\", \"Carnival\", \"Shaking\", \"Let You Down\" and \"Sleeping In\", which didn't make the album. The band's feedback directed the next set of songs recorded around June, which included \"Superman's Dead\" and a re-recording of \"Hello Oscar\". Raine Maida said in an interview, \"We took a lot of time experimenting. The album was really done in three months. We took another two months to really go back over stuff and re-record. It's neat to look back and know the extra time we took was important to the record.\" Around this time (April), the working title of the album was \"Propeller\", as Raine explained, \"as in, that which causes forward movement.\" This was probably as a testament to the band's evolution since their debut album. Another working title was \"Trapeze\", named after the song that didn't make the album. The cover art proves that this title came close to being chosen. The name was changed to \"Clumsy\" in early September. Recording wrapped up by the end of that month. The album was mastered at Gateway Studios in Portland, Maine by Bob Ludwig.\n\nRaine stated that there was a kind of \"Carnival atmosphere\" to the whole album and that many of the lyrics he wrote were set at the circus or a carnival. \n\"Clumsy\"'s songs feature the striking vocals of lead vocalist Raine Maida, who utilizes an often jarring falsetto technique: Maida jumps from lower octaves in his vocal range to higher ones. Raine's vocals provide most of the melody of the songs, with guitars quieted down in this album compared to \"Naveed\", their previous album. This aspect of singing has become the staple sound of the band, continuing with this fashion in their next studio album \"Happiness...Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch,\" and since lost on their 2005 album \"Healthy in Paranoid Times.\". In a January 1997 interview, the band stated that then new bassist Duncan Coutts, who also plays cello, keyboards and sings background vocals, influenced the sound on \"Clumsy\" even though he doesn't have any songwriting credits. He broadened the band's palette of sounds. Given those new parameters, the band couldn't help but change their sound.\n\nIn early 1996, Our Lady Peace's American label, Relativity Records, in a decision to switch to an urban format, eliminated ten label positions in their Rock category, including OLP. They moved to another Sony-owned label, Columbia Records for the release of \"Clumsy\"'s first single in Canada, \"Superman's Dead\". Columbia would handle all of the band's releases in both Canada and the United States.\n\n\"Clumsy\" debuted at #1 in Canada, selling 26,000 copies in Canada during its first week. It would go on to become Our Lady Peace's best-selling album. On February 28, 2001, the album was certified Diamond in Canada. On July 12, 2004, \"Clumsy\" was certified Platinum in the United States. Between 1996 and 2016, \"Clumsy\" was the best-selling album by a Canadian band in Canada and the eight best-selling album by a Canadian artist overall in Canada.\n\nOur Lady Peace toured in support of \"Clumsy\" from a month before the album's release in early 1997 and into 1998. The first leg of the tour, focusing on Canadian colleges, kicked off at Loyalist College in Belleville, Ontario on January 13, 1997 where eight of the album's eleven tracks were premiered including \"Superman's Dead\", \"4 AM\" and others. This leg of the tour continued until March 1997, ending with a private music industry show at the Elbow Room in New York City.\n\nThe tour's second leg began on May 2, with the band playing two shows in Michigan before going off to Europe to promote the album's recent release there. The band returned and toured across the United States, only dipping into Canada to play at the very first Summersault festival. The North American tour continued until the end of September 1997 when Our Lady Peace joined Everclear as an opening act with whom they would tour until the end of 1997.\n\nIn January 1998, the band embarked on a 22-date headlining tour across Canada which included several shows opening for \"The Rolling Stones\". On February 26, Our Lady Peace began their first headlining tour in the United States with Headswim and Black Lab opening. Following this they returned to Europe again for a 14-show tour across Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany. Further touring in the U.S. with Third Eye Blind and Eve 6 lasted into September 1998. The year of touring was concluded with the second Summersault festival being held. Our Lady Peace would spend the rest of the year working on their third studio album, \"Happiness... Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch\".\n\nIn December 2009, the band announced that they would be \"recreating\" both \"Clumsy\" and their 2000 record \"Spiritual Machines\" by performing them live in their entireties throughout a new tour that began in March 2010; only nine months before the 10-year anniversary of the release of \"Spiritual Machines\".\n\nAs listed in liner notes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2320958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320958", "title": "Sundgau", "text": "Sundgau\n\nSundgau (, ) is a geographical territory in the southern Alsace region (Haut Rhin and Belfort), on the eastern edge of France. The name is derived from Alemannic German \"Sunt-gowe\" (\"South shire\"), denoting an Alemannic county in the Old High German period. The principal city and historical capital is Altkirch.\n\nThe considerably smaller French pays of Sundgau, implemented by the 1999 Loi Voynet, roughly corresponds to the arrondissement of Altkirch, comprising four cantons and 112 communes in the south of the larger Sundgau region.\n\nThe hilly region is bounded on the south by the Swiss border and the foothills of the Jura, in the east by the valley of the Rhine in the vicinity of Basel, to the north by Mulhouse and the potassium-rich basin of Alsace, and to the west by the Belfort Gap. It comprises parts of the modern Department of Haut-Rhin and the Territory of Belfort in the regions of Alsace and the Franche-Comté.\n\nThe fertile loess soil has traditionally favoured a non-specialised agriculture, with crop production being largely organised into strips. The main crops are maize, wheat and colza.\n\nThe Ill, the most important river in Alsace, crosses Sundgau from south to north before flowing into the Rhine. Its source is at Winkel in the foothills of the Jura. Other rivers define the region's valleys, such as the Largue, which rises near Courtavon, passes through Dannemarie, and meets the Ill at Illfurth.\n\nIn medieval times, monks raised carp in the small valley ponds and \"carpe frite\" (\"fried carp\") remains a regional speciality. The images of two carp also appear in the coat of arms of Sundgau.\n\nArchaeological digs have revealed vestiges of palaeolithic and Neolithic settlements. Traces of Bronze Age cremation pyres have also been found. Excavations at Illfurth date from the Iron Age (650 BC to 430 BC).\n\nIn the 1st century BC, the Sequani tribe (the most \"Gaulish of Gauls\" according to historian Henri Martin), which was centered around Besançon, settled in Sundgau. From 70 BC, they waged perpetual warfare with their neighbours, the Aedui, calling upon German mercenaries, led by Ariovistus. When the conflict finished, the Germans settled into the region, and the Sequani, to remove them appealed to the Romans. Julius Caesar defeated Ariovistus in 58 BC near Cernay, and a long domination by the Romans commenced. This ended suddenly in 405, when the Alamani crossed the Rhine and occupied Sundgau. They, in turn, were followed by the Franks following their victory at the Battle of Tolbiac in 496. Sundgau was incorporated into the kingdom of Austrasia and Christianity was introduced under the Merovingians.\n\nAbout 750, the Duchy of Alsace was divided into two counties, Nordgau (\"Unterelsass\") and Sundgau, the latter being mentioned in the Treaty of Mersen in 870. Historically then, Sundgau coincides with the lands of the counts of Ferrette and Habsburg, excepting the town of Mulhouse and its territories of Illzach and . Geographically, Sundgau denotes a more restricted area comprising the hilly country to the south of Mulhouse and reaching to the valley of Lucelle.\n\nDuring the 9th century and the 10th century Sundgau was administered by the Lieutfried family. Following the breakup of Charlemagne's empire, the region entered a period of instability, culminating in the emergence of feudalism. From 925 on, the Sundgau belonged to the Duchy of Swabia; it remained a part of Swabia until the Duchy disintegrated in the 13th century.\n\nIn 1125, Frederic, son of Theodoric I of Montbéliard, inherited the south of Alsace and became count of Ferrette. So, from 1125 to 1324, a large part of the Sundgau was administered by the counts of Ferrette. Ulrich III (1310–1324) conquered the valley of Saint-Amarin but died with no male issue. His daughter Jeanne married Albert II, Duke of Austria in 1324, and the County of Ferrette fell to Austria and was integrated with the other Habsburg possessions in the area.\n\nThe Landgraviate of Sundgau (also known as Landgraviate of Upper Alsace), the successor of the Carolingian county, had been administered by the counts of Habsburg since 1135. They had owned the adjacent County of Sundgau even earlier. The Habsburgs enlarged their possessions in the area with numerous acquisitions in the following centuries, until by the mid-14th century almost all of the former Carolingian county was in the possession of Habsburg. Their consolidated territories in the area became known simply as the Sundgau, and belonged to the Austrian Circle of the Empire after 1512. The Habsburgian Sundgau was administered from Ensisheim by a \"bailli\" (bailiff or seneschal) and divided into four bailiwicks (Landser, Thann, Altkirch and Ferrette). Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy tried unsuccessfully to claim the Sundgau during the Gugler War of 1375.\n\nAs of 1500, the Austrian Sundgau encompassed most of the southern Alsace and was bordered by the following states (from the north, clockwise): Imperial City of Colmar, County of Württemberg, the Austrian Breisgau, the Margraviate of Baden, the Imperial City of Basel, the Bishopric of Basel, the County of Württemberg (County of Montbéliard), the Duchy of Lorraine, the Abbacy of Murbach, and the Bishopric of Strasbourg (the \"Mundat\"). The Imperial City of Mulhouse formed an enclave surrounded by the Sundgau.\nThe Reformation did not trouble Sundgau, despite the proximity of Basle and Mulhouse. The country maintained its fidelity to the religion of the Habsburgs, Catholicism.\n\nCommencing in 1632, the Thirty Years' War broke upon Sundgau, with a violence unprecedented in the history of the region. The Swedish, supported by France, invaded the country, pillaging and burning all in their path. In reaction, the inhabitants of the countryside revolted. But the rebellion was subdued, and the Swedes hanged the ringleaders from roadside trees. From 1634, the Swedes ceded their fortresses to the French, and in 1648 the war ended with the Treaty of Westphalia. The butcher's bill was disastrous – some parts of Sundgau had lost up to 80% of their population. The country, only German speaking at that time, was conquered and annexed by France, and in 1659, the counthood of Ferrette was granted to cardinal Mazarin (nominally by the then 21-year-old Louis XIV).\n\nThe beginning of the 18th century was a period of prosperity with the development of agriculture and the development of the textile industry. But economic and social conditions deteriorated in the second half of the century, with overpowering taxation, and occasional famines.\n\nIn 1789, the repercussions of the French Revolution reached Sundgau, and many conflicts arose in the townships, mainly due to the unpopularity of the ruling classes. In 1790, Sundgau was included into the département of Haut-Rhin, and Altkirch became its principal town.\n\nOrder was restored during the Consulate and the Empire. Little changed during the 19th century, agriculture remaining the principal economic activity, despite the establishment of industries such as the Gilardoni tileworks in 1835 and the construction of Xavier Jourdains' looms in Altkirch.\nAs a result of the 1870 war, Sundgau returned to Germany. Economic development picked up, and the region opened up to the rest of Alsace, for want of trade with France.\n\nThe battles of the First World War commenced in Sundgau in August 1914. The French blew up the viaduct of Dannemarie, and the front stabilised and extended from the Vosges to the Swiss frontier. The population suffered artillery bombardments and, for fear of spying, many were evacuated into those communes untouched by war.\n\nSundgau reverted to France in 1918, but its reintegration posed several problems; since Alsace was German speaking, they now saw themselves obliged to express themselves in French. By way of derogation, German was taught in schools for three hours a week. The administration was only in French and the mayor was appointed by the French government.\n\nBetween the wars, 56% of the population worked in agriculture, 28% in industry and only 7% in services.\n\nIn the Second World War after the declaration of war, the communes bordering on the Rhine were evacuated. The German army crossed the river on June 15, 1940. Following the Armistice of June 22, Sundgau was once again in German hands. Jews, North Africans and French-speakers were expelled to the \"free zone\" between it and Vichy France, while school children were forced to speak German and absolutely forbidden to express themselves in French. Communes were renamed, and youngsters enrolled in Hitler Youth from 1942.\nFrom then also, men born between 1914 and 1925 were drafted in the Wehrmacht.\n\nGeneral Jean de Lattre de Tassigny's troops reached the Sundgau in November 1944, with Seppois-le-Bas being the first. As after the first World War, language issues arose. From 1945 to 1984 the use of German in newspapers was restricted to a maximum of 25%.\n\nPost-war, there was a period of reconstruction and economic growth. Jean Fourastié's \"Trente Glorieuses\", the thirty years of economic growth 1945 to 1973, ended by the first Oil Crisis, and the number of agricultural workers dropped year by year. More than 35% of the population currently work in services.\n\nSundgau is an arrondissement (the arrondissement of Altkirch) and is divided into 4 cantons: Dannemarie, Altkirch, Hirsingue and Ferrette. These run roughly along a North/South axis (see map) and consist of 112 communes. These communes are in turn grouped into 8 communities and one village (Bernwiller) for economic and tourism promotion purposes.\n\nThe population reached 61,841 inhabitants in 1999 (up from 57,112 in 1990), an increase of 8.3%. Thus it paralleled the demographic growth both of Haut-Rhin (which showed an increase of 5.3% in the same period), and, more broadly, that of Alsace itself, (which showed an increase of 6.8%).\n\nAltkirch is the most populous of Sundgauvien communes, with 5,386 inhabitants (1999). This is followed by Hirsingue (2,057 inhabitants), then Dannemarie (2,011 inhabitants).\nNotably, 70% of the population is spread out among 103 communes of less than 1,000 inhabitants each. Finally, 19.2% of the inhabitants are aged under 15, while 19.3% are over 60. As in the remainder of France, the proportion of over-60s is growing.\n\nSundgau remains primarily an agricultural region with traditional activities. Important urban centres such as the tri-national conurbation of Basle, the urbanised area of Belfort-Montbéliard-Sochaux, the Mulhouse conurbation, are nearby and are attractive as providers of goods and services. Qualifications are lower and revenues higher as a result of border area employment and its economic and social impact.\n\nNevertheless, Sundgau remains underequipped, notably for company startups. Although several enterprises have started during the last ten years, it is not sufficiently attractive as an employment basin because of the counterattractions of the nearby conurbations.\n\nSundgau is ringed by major roads, such as the A36 motorway between Belfort and Mulhouse, and the A35 toll-road, between Mulhouse and Basle; nevertheless, the elected representatives agree that the road network is outdated. Other important roadways are the D419, crossing the region from east to west between Belfort and Basle and passing through Dannemarie and Altkirch, and the North-South D432, passing through Illfurth, Altkirch, Hirsingue and Ferrette.\n\nSeveral current projects aim at improving the road network and bypassing villages. These include diversions at Retzwiller and Dannemarie, and the Spechbach-le-Bas and Hochstatt bypasses. Another large project, the extension of the rapid road from Dornach as far as Altkirch, is under discussion.\n\nThe Paris-Bâle line serves the towns of Dannemarie, Altkirch and Illfurth. Regional trains are relatively frequent, and useful for Sundgauviens working in Mulhouse or Belfort.\nWork on a Dijon-Mulhouse line of the TGV Rhine-Rhône is planned to start in 2006.\n\nThe canal from the Rhône to the Rhine crosses Sundgau by Montreux-Vieux, Dannemarie and Illfurth. It has existed since 1824 and was conceived by Freycinet. Nowadays, it is too narrow for large barges and serves mainly for pleasure craft.\n\nA large project for the construction of a canal linking the Rhine to the Saône, passing along the Doubs, has been abandoned. Indirectly, it would have linked central Europe (Rhine, Danube, North Sea and Baltic Sea) to the Mediterranean without having to ship merchandise through the Straits of Gibraltar. But the anger of agriculturalists and environmentalists influenced the Minister of the Environment to abandon the project in 1998.\n\nThe General Council of Haut-Rhin has taken an interest in Sundgau and in developing tourism in the region since 2000, along the lines of the management of the source of the Ill or the construction of a rest area on the route D419 near Chavannes-sur-l'étang. Sundgau is a region where the lifestyle permits the development of \"Green Tourism\" (i.e. where the visitor seeks calm, wishes to be in direct contact with nature, and has activities such as countryside walks and drives available).\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in Rottweil, Württemberg (afterwards part of Germany). \n\nWernz was the first of the eight children of parents with deep faith and piety. From an early age he had expressed his desire to be a Jesuit, perhaps influenced by the fact that his parish church in Rottweil had been a Jesuit church before the suppression and still retained many reminders of the Society. The paintings of many Jesuit saints and the fact that the yearly parish mission was given by Jesuits had probably helped him to make the decision. \n\nHe entered the society on December 5, 1857, made his novitiate at Gorheim near Sigmaringen, and took his first vows on December 8, 1859. From 1864-1868 and from 1872-1873 he was educator and teacher at Stella Matutina (Jesuit School) in Feldkirch, Austria. He studied theology and philosophy at the Maria Laach and Aachen abbeys. When the Kulturkampf of Chancellor Bismarck expelled the Jesuits from Germany, the exiled scholastics, after a short stay at Stella Matutina, found refuge in a Jesuit college, Ditton Hall in Lancashire in England and, finally, in 1881 moved to St Beuno's in Wales. After a year of private study he became Professor of Canon Law at Ditton Hall and later at St Beuno's. Between 1882 and 1906 he taught canon law at the Gregorian University, the last two years spent there he also served as its rector.\n\nAfter the death of Luis Martín, the vicar general summoned a congregation for August 31, 1906, but it began after a day's postponement on September 1 and would last until October 18. On the third ballot taken on September 8, the 64-year-old Wernz was elected general.\n\nDuring his generalate he vigorously promoted the spiritual life, opened missions and created provinces in all parts of the world. The whole continent of North America was one of his special interests and he approved the setting up of provinces, houses, and colleges the length and breadth of that vast territory. Father Martín had set up the famous \"Monumenta Historica\" and Wernz continued his support and encouraged Jesuit writers to take up this important work, which they did with enthusiasm. He was instrumental in the founding of the Jesuit periodicals \"Voces e Maria ad Lacum\" which became \"Stimmen der Zeit\" in Germany and another, \"Przeglad Powszechny\", in Poland.\n\nOne of his last letters written on December 25, 1913, to the Society was on the celebration of the centenary of the society's restitution, to take place the following year.\n\nWernz had been General for seven years and eleven months, from September 8, 1906, until he died on August 19, 1914. His death occurred only a few hours before that of Pope Pius X and a mere three weeks after the outbreak of the First World War. It would be a difficult time for his successor to begin leading an international Society in a world internationally shattered.\n\nHis tomb can be found in the Jesuit Mausoleum at the Roman Campo Verano cemetery.\n"}

{"id": "2320992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320992", "title": "Vinci (board game)", "text": "Vinci (board game)\n\nVinci is a board game designed by Philippe Keyaerts. It resembles a diceless variant of \"Risk\" with variable special abilities and an original decline mechanic, and is also similar in some ways to \"History of the World\". The game's name, pronounced \"Vinchi\", means \"to be conquered\" in Latin. In 2009, the game's mechanics were re-implemented with several changes and a fantasy-oriented theme as \"Small World\", also credited to Keyaerts, and published by Days of Wonder.\nEach player begins the game by selecting one of several available civilizations. Each civilization is defined by two tokens, each offering a special ability or special scoring opportunity. Each token also provides the civilization with a number of playing \"pawns\", to which an extra number is added based on the number of players in the game.\n\nThe player then makes use of these pawns to capture territory. This is done in a diceless manner: to capture a territory, a player must place a particular number of pawns in it, based on the location of the territory, the number of defending pawns, and any special abilities of the player's civilization. If the player can place a sufficient number of pawns, the capture is guaranteed to succeed; if they cannot, the move is illegal. If enemy pawns are defeated in a captured territory, one of them is removed from the game entirely and the remainder are returned to the owning player to replace in their own territories. At the end of each turn, a player scores points based on the number of territories they own, with some civilization abilities providing bonuses.\n\nSince the number of pawns in a civilization is (usually) fixed, and can only go down as other civilizations capture territories, eventually a civilization will reach a maximum number of territories that it can support. At the beginning of any turn, the player owning that civilization can declare that it is going into \"decline\". This allows the player to select a new civilization and bring that onto the board while the pawns of the former civilization remain in place, no longer movable but continuing to gather points until their territories are captured.\n\nThe game continues until a certain number of points is reached, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.\n\nKevin Wilson comments: \"\"Vinci\" is a tremendous light strategy game that captures the feel of conquering your way across Europe at the head of a marauding band of Gauls without having to deal with the minutiae of where to build your new aqueduct and how many archers to train this turn. It is highly recommended for gamers who enjoy titles such as \"Civilization\", but who simply don't have as much energy or free time as they once had to invest in them.\"\n"}

Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch\n\nHappiness... Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch (written as simply Happiness... on the cover) is the third studio album by Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace. It was released on September 21, 1999 by Columbia Records. The album was very successful in Canada, debuting at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart. The album was certified 3x Platinum in July 2001. Hit singles from the album include \"One Man Army\", \"Is Anybody Home?\", and \"Thief\". The final track on the CD, \"Stealing Babies\", features Elvin Jones, a prominent post-bop jazz drummer. The photo shoot for this album took place around Staten Island in New York State.\n\nBy early 1998, while touring for \"Clumsy\", the members of Our Lady Peace were already eager to get back into the studio. \"We're all starting to get that itch,\" bass player Duncan Coutts said in a March 1998 interview. \"We're all writing collectively and individually. Everyone's hovered over their four-track machines, if we're not trying to work things out in sound checks.\"\n\nMike Turner and Raine Maida say they wanted to make an album that didn't sound derivative, an accusation that had stung them in the past. Smashing Pumpkins leader Billy Corgan infamously accused them of ripping off his band. They tried to counter the remark for their new album. \"We've toured so much for the last five years throughout the U.S. and Canada and with all the bands we've played with . . . music became so diluted and so disposable we said: `If we're going to make a record, let's put out something that maybe challenges people.'\" \n\nAccording to Raine Maida, the overall idea of the album is human obsession, \"A lot of this record came from obsessions: Definitely seeing those obsessions in the States, the guns, the Gap ads and how the media determines who you are these days... During the recording of this record, we talked a lot about death, for whatever reason. There's definitely an obsession with death and a huge fear. But in knowing that, it makes you hate these other things more, because it's not what life's about. Buying Tommy Hilfinger (sic) because it's cool has nothing to do with any kind of emotional value or content, and music for me does. So when they hit each other, I get pretty emotional about it.\"\n\nFor their third studio album, Our Lady Peace chose again to work with producer Arnold Lanni in Toronto. The band began writing, demoing and general jamming for \"Happiness...\" in late November soon after their appearance at the 1998 Summersault festival. Raine brought in many of the songs he had written in demo form already recorded and the rest of the band expanded upon those. Unlike previous albums, Mike Turner took little part in writing the album. Recording began in mid-January 1999. The band isolated themselves in the studio with little outside contact. They spent one and a half months recording the bed tracks of vocals and guitar and a week and a half each for drum and bass parts. The album took four months to record in all. For the first time, this album was recorded entirely on digital equipment using ProTools to edit. \"It's the best thing for us because you don't have to wait between takes like if I'm doing a vocal take or Jeremy's doing drum stuff, if you want to do it again, you can do it instantaneously.\" Other new effects the band used included filtering percussion through a distortion box and recording guitar parts through antique microphones, including one used by Stevie Wonder.\n\nFormer drummer for John Coltrane, Elvin Jones makes a guest appearance on the final track of the album \"Stealing Babies\". Jeremy Taggart was a big fan of Jones' and was able to meet him through his drum technician while at a show in Seattle. He invited Jones' into the Toronto studio early into the recording sessions to record drums for the song, which were recorded in one take.\n\nHalfway through recording, the band realized that the music they were recording would be very hard to recreate live, especially for Mike Turner. They decided to hire Boston area multi-instrumentalist Jamie Edwards, who had formerly played with Blue Man Group and that Jeremy knew through a mutual friend, to augment their live shows. \"The turning point was when we decided to take off the table our usual constraint, which is that if we can't pull it off as a three-piece instrumental then we shouldn't be doing it,\" said Mike Turner. \"Now we're like, we'll get another guy, we'll do whatever we have to, let's just make a great record. So we indulged ourselves with a lot of textures, a lot of other sounds.\" Jamie provided extra guitar as well as Keyboards and other special effects and ended up recording for the album. The band was looking to make a sonic leap forward from their previous albums. \"We took the things we thought were original from 'Clumsy' and 'Naveed' and tried to overdo them.\" said Raine Maida, \"As well, our songwriting really improved.\"\n\nRaine Maida has stated that the album is so tight and so well executed because the band only recorded 12 songs during the Happiness sessions, instead of recording 20 or more like they did with their previous two albums. They strove to achieve a much simpler method of songwriting than on the previous albums which included tightening up songs and forming more cohesive tracks. This allowed each song to have the utmost attention given to it while being written and it sometimes took one week or more to record one song. \"Annie\" for example, took over two weeks of jam sessions to become a fully realized song.\n\nThis was the first album of theirs to not be \"mixed\" by their producer Arnold Lanni. It was instead sent to Kevin Shirley at Avatar Studios in New York City. The mixing of the album was completed by late June 1999 when they played many of the songs for the first time for a large audience at Woodstock 1999.\n\nTo promote the upcoming release of their album in September, Our Lady Peace performed a live in-studio concert and Q&A which was aired to 12 Canadian radio stations simultaneously utilizing satellite and ISDN technology. Listeners to any of the stations could call in and ask the band members questions. On September 13, 1999 a special listening party was held on a newly redesigned ourladypeace.com where fans could listen to the entire album via streamlink. The band also held an online chat with fans for a Q & A session.\n\n\"Happiness...\" was released in Canada on September 21, 1999. The album was very successful in its first week, selling 40,090 copies and debuting at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart.\nUpon its release, \"Happiness...\" was panned by many critics who cited it as being over-ambitious and too dour in subject manner. In the band's hometown, Ben Rayner, the reviewer of \"The Toronto Star\" said, \"...there's something curiously unmoving and dispassionate about it - it's canned angst ordered from some overstocked and increasingly disused alt-rock warehouse outside of Seattle, too studious and sterile to ever really hit you the way rock 'n' roll is supposed to.\" Leigh Buckley Fountain of the \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\" gave the album a B- and positively noted that, \"The same catchy melodies, same distracted off-kilter rhythms dominate this album that dominated 1998's \"Clumsy\". but went on to criticize Maida's vocal performance as being \"too experimental\". He also had to say about the lyrical content, \"One problem with the album is its typically vague, tangential lyrics. Critics have called Maida a \"philosopher,\" but I'm not so sure I'd go all that far. I like what he does, but snippets out of the blue like \"Nazis breast feeding\" don't do much for me.\"\n\nDavid Gerard of the \"Boston Globe\" praised the guitar playing from the album, especially on the song \"Blister\" and also noted how the band had expanded its musical turf. Melissa Maino of \"The Buffalo News\" also reviewed the album positively, citing \"Thief\" as a stand-out track and saying that, \"Our Lady Peace's music may be a little predictable, but if it's not broke, don't fix it.\" In a 2.5 star review, the \"San Antonio Express-News\" praised the album for its high energy and subtle textures but criticized the vocals, saying \"Raine Maida's overexposed falsetto is grating enough to send borderline psychotics over the edge.\"\n\nThe songs on \"Happiness...\" focus on a lighter melody, often following vocalist Raine Maida's extreme range of octaves sung in a falsetto-like manner. He could travel from one octave to another with ease and very smoothly. This created a very surreal effect to the songs, best shown on songs like \"Happiness & the Fish\", \"Blister\" and \"Lying Awake\", much like \"Big Dumb Rocket\" from \"Clumsy\". The overall sound was quite a departure from their first album, \"Naveed\", featuring very toned-down guitars and the addition of synthesizers and other instruments, typical in most alternative rock albums.\n\nRaine explained the album's overall concept in an early 2000 interview with \"Vue Weekly\":\n\nThe lyrics on the album are mostly written in the first-person. The lyrics are usually about unusual themes—laziness, isolation, loneliness and happiness, most explained in a metaphorical manner. The track \"Lying Awake\" was said to be about Benny Hinn, and how Raine Maida viewed him as a con-artist, trying to scam people into religion. \"Annie\" is said to be about a girl who is made an outcast, and ends up killing everybody in the end, similar to Pearl Jam's song \"Jeremy\" on their début album \"Ten\".\n\nIn an online chat in March 2001, Mike Turner revealed the inspiration for this song. \"The song was inspired by a PBS documentary about a little girl named Eve that was diagnosed with AIDS when she was 6 years old. She went around the world and visited other kids with AIDS. Raine was so inspired. The song features John Coltrane’s drummer, Elvin Jones, who played on the album \"A Love Supreme\".\n\nBefore their show at Woodstock in June, Our Lady Peace played a set of secret gigs in Muskoka and Toronto under the pseudonym Belly Flop Communist, at Jamie Edwards' suggestion. T-shirts were even made up and sold at the shows. While the shows were secret, the band divulged their true identity over the radio causing the shows to soon sell out. Here, the band played many of the songs from \"Happiness\" for the very first time live. They played at Woodstock on July 25, 1999 where they played a 12 song set including six songs from the new album.\n\nSoon after the release of \"Happiness...\" in September 1999 the band set off on a tour across the United States opening with Oleander for Creed. They did a short tour in Europe opening for The Stereophonics in December as well as in February 2000 back in Canada. The cross-America tour continued into January 2000 before the band began their cross-Canadian headline tour dubbed \"The World's a Blister Tour\". They returned to the United States in the Spring to participate in multiple music festivals such as Pointfest in St. Louis, Missouri and SpringFest in Pensacola, Florida.\n\nDuring August 2000, the members of OLP organized the second Summersault tour, where them and other Canadian and American bands including The Smashing Pumpkins and Foo Fighters toured together across Canada. Touring effectively ended after Summersault as the band had announced work for a brand new studio album, \"Spiritual Machines\" which they had been working on since before the festival and which would be completed and released in Canada before the end of the year.\n\n\n\n"}

It was also the third number-one hit of the 1980s, a decade whose pop singles chart would soon be dominated by Jackson.\n\nIt reached number one on both the US pop (Jackson's third number-one on this chart) and R&B charts (Jackson's second number one on that chart). It spent a total of four weeks at the top position on the former chart from January 19 to February 9, 1980, and six weeks (from January 5 to February 9, 1980) on the latter chart. According to \"Billboard\", the song was the fourth biggest single of 1980. It is also considered one of the last hits of the disco era.\n\nIt was re-released as a single on February 27, 2006, as part of the \"\" box set.\n\nThis song is written in the key of E minor. Meter is 4/4 at 114 bpm.\n\nThe track received generally positive reviews from music critics. J. Edward Keyes of \"Rolling Stone\" said \"What's remarkable about 'Rock With You' is how unobtrusive it is: a silky string section and barely-there twitch of guitar — Michael doesn't even hit the word 'Rock' all that hard — he just glides over it, preferring to charm with a wink and a smile rather than with aggression or ferocity.\" Steven Hyden called it his \"favorite song\", and noted the line \"Girrrrrrl, when you dance, there's a magic that must be love\" as being \"the most purely joyful moment [Hyden] has ever heard in a pop song\".\nAllMusic highlighted the song on the album itself. Robert Christgau called it a \"smooth ballad\".\n\nA music video was released for the song, using the shorter single version. It features Michael in a sparkly sequined suit singing the song with a bright laser behind him. The video was directed by Bruce Gowers.\n\nThe music video was included on the video albums: \"Video Greatest Hits - HIStory\", \"Number Ones\" and \"Michael Jackson's Vision\".\n\nMichael first performed the song on the Jacksons' Destiny World Tour on the second leg. He performed the song on the Jacksons' Triumph Tour and Victory Tour. He performed the song on his solo tour the Bad World Tour. He also performed the song during the HIStory World Tour, as a part of the \"Off the Wall\" medley (Also featuring Off the Wall and Don't Stop Til' You Get Enough) in certain concerts. \"Rock with You\" was rehearsed for the Dangerous World Tour, but was not performed. Jackson also would have performed it for the This Is It concert series, but the shows were canceled, due to his sudden death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The garden is located at 178 Northeast Street (东北街178号), Gusu District.\nAt 78 mu () (), it is the largest garden in Suzhou and is considered by some to be the finest garden in all of southern China.\n\nOn the garden's site was first built a garden during the Shaoxing period (1131-1162) of the Southern Song Dynasty. Afterwards it changed ownership, and was destroyed or modified continually. It was the residence and garden of Lu Guimeng, a Tang Dynasty scholar. Later in the Yuan Dynasty it became the Dahong Temple's garden.\n\nIn 1513, Wang Xiancheng, an Imperial Envoy and poet of the Ming Dynasty, created a garden on the site of the dilapidated Dahong Temple which had been burnt during the Ming conquest. In 1510, he retired to his native home of Suzhou on the occasion of his father's death. He had experienced a tumultuous official life punctuated by various demotions and promotions, and gave up his last official post as magistrate of Yongjia county in Zhejiang province, and began to work on the garden. This garden, meant to express his fine taste, received close attention from the renowned artist, Suzhou native, and friend, Wen Zhengming. The garden was named (first evidence around 1517) after a verse by the famous scholar official of the Jin Dynasty, Pan Yue, in his prose, \"An Idle Life\", \"I enjoy a carefree life by planting trees and building my own house...I irrigate my garden and grow vegetables for me to eat...such a life suits a retired official like me well\". This verse symbolized Wang's desire to retire from politics and adopt a hermit's life in the manner of Tao Yuanming. In the Xianju rhyme-prose, he writes 'This is the way of ruling for an unsuccessful politician'. It took 16 years until 1526 to complete. Wen Zhenming wrote an essay \"Notes of Wang's Humble Administrator's Garden\", and painted \"Landscapes of the Humble Administrator's Garden\" in 1533 including 31 paintings and poems to commemorate the garden. Wen produced a second album of eight leaves showing sites in the garden in 1551, with different views but the same poems as in 1533.\nWang's son lost the garden to pay gambling debts, and it has changed hands many times since. In 1631 the eastern garden was divided from the rest and purchased by Wang Xinyi, Vice Minister of the Justice Board. He added many modifications over the next four years, finishing work in 1635. After completion it was renamed \"Dwelling Upon Return to the Countryside\" (). The central garden was purchased by Jiang Qi, Governor of Jiangsu in 1738. After extensive renovations he renamed it Garden Rebuilt. In 1860, it became the residence of a Taiping prince, Li Xiucheng, and it was remodelled, and the current aspect of the garden is said to be inherited from this period. Also in 1738 the Western Garden was purchased by Ye Shikuan Chief Histographer, and renamed The Garden of Books. The Garden of Books was purchased by a Suzhou merchant, Zhang Lüqian, in 1877 and renamed The Subsidiary Garden. In 1949 all three parts of the garden were rejoined by the Chinese government and subsequently opened to the public, then restored in 1952. In 1997 the garden was given UNESCO World Heritage status.\n\nCao Xueqin, author of the \"Dream of the Red Chamber\", is supposed to have lived at the garden during his teenage years – around 1735. Among Chinese scholars, it is believed that much of the garden in his novel \"Dream of the Red Chamber\" was inspired by the scenery of the Humble Administrator's Garden.\n\nThe garden contains numerous pavilions and bridges set among a maze of connected pools and islands. It consists of three major parts set about a large lake: the central part (Zhuozheng Yuan), the eastern part (once called Guitianyuanju, Dwelling Upon Return to the Countryside), and a western part (the Supplementary Garden). The house lies in the south of the garden. In total, the garden contains 48 different buildings with 101 tablets, 40 steles, 21 precious old trees, and over 700 Suzhou-style penjing/penzai. According to , compared with the layout from the Zhenghe Period in the Ming Dynasty, the garden \"now has more buildings and islets\", and although lacks a \"lofty\" feeling, it is \"still a masterpiece of meticulous work\". Liu Dunzhen judged that the arrangement of rocks and water in the ponds of the central third may have its origins in the early Qing. The western third retains the late nineteenth-century layout, while the eastern third has seen several renovation since. But Clunas believes that even this is unreasonably optimistic, and he underlines that Liu Dunzhen and others tend to imply that, \"despite the vicissitudes of history, there is continuity at the much more important level of essence\".\n\nXue Zhijian, the curator of the garden and of the Suzhou Garden Museum, explained the exquisite design and aesthetic value of the Humble Administrator's Garden, the largest of Suzhou's gardens. \"This style of Suzhou old style garden has numerous layers,\" Xue says. \"There are four particular components: the stone, the plant, the architecture and the water.\" And these are woven together in endless combinations. \nAt one corner in the Humble Administrator's Garden, rocks cutthrough the wall, making viewers feel like they are exploring a mountain, despite the fact that they are in the middle of the city. The plants here represent various seasons, peonies for spring, lotus for summer, osmanthus in the winter time and plum blooms in winter.\n\nEastern Garden: Composed of a few buildings around a central great lawn and pond combination. The lawn is ringed by a grove of crape myrtle trees in allusion to the Tang Dynasty State Secretariat which was nicknamed the Crape Myrtle Department.\n\nCentral Garden: This section is composed of many scenes arranged around the \"Surging Wave\" Pond. Within the pond three islands recreate the scenery of the fairy islands of the east sea (see Penglai).\n\nWestern Garden: This part is only half the size of the central part, and is also mainly dominated by water. The pond runs from north to south, and at the central part rises an islet. Although small, it is planned with meticulous care and precision. The buildings, though numerous, do not clutter, small mountains and ponds do not give a cramped impression.\n\n\n"}

The stretch of South Street between Front Street and Seventh Street is known for its \"bohemian\", \"punk\", and generally \"alternative\" atmosphere and its diverse urban mix of shops, bars, and eateries. It is one of Philadelphia's largest tourist attractions.\n\nFrom west to east, South Street traverses the following neighborhoods:\n\nSouth Street begins at 33rd and Spruce Streets in University City, heading east-southeast past the University of Pennsylvania's Franklin Field and the University Museum. It crosses the Schuylkill River on the South Street Bridge, a fixed bridge built in 2010 to replace a former double bascule bridge dating from 1923. South Street then heads east (relative to the city grid), and becomes one-way eastbound from 27th Street all the way to Front Street.\n\nSouth Street marks the 600 South block (from Market Street) in the city's gridiron street system. In West Philadelphia, the 600 South is delineated between 45th and 63rd Streets by Cedar Avenue, the name being a relic of the original name for South Street (Cedar Street) in the original plan for Philadelphia as drafted by William Penn. South Street and Cedar Avenue are discontinuous with each other due to Woodland Cemetery, the University of Pennsylvania (the former Blockley Township), and the Schuylkill River.\n\nNamed Cedar Street in William Penn's plan of Philadelphia, South Street was the traditional southern boundary of Philadelphia's city limits before the city annexed the townships of Passyunk, Moyamensing and Southwark.\n\nUntil the 1950s, South Street was known mainly as a garment district, with stores for men's suits and other clothing, while the more western areas around South Street served as a cultural and commercial center for South Philadelphia's African American community. Real estate values plummeted after city planner Edmund Bacon and others proposed the Crosstown Expressway, a short limited-access expressway connecting the Schuylkill Expressway and I-95 that would have required the demolition of many buildings on South Street and Bainbridge Street (an east-west street one block south of South Street). The suddenly cheap property attracted artists and counterculture-types. The proposed expressway was never built due to public opposition.\n\nSouth Street is traversed over its entire length by SEPTA's Route 40 bus, running eastbound on South and westbound on Lombard Street through Center City. During evenings and weekends, the 40 bus avoids the pedestrian congestion east of Broad Street by turning north on Broad and then turning east on Pine Street all the way to Front Street. Several other transit routes cross South Street, most important being the subsurface Broad Street Line with its station at Lombard-South.\n\n\n"}

In this episode a sinister criminal is hiding in the mind of someone on Deep Space Nine, a space station in the 24th century of the \"Star Trek\" science fiction universe.\n\nEn route back to the station in a runabout, Kira and Bashir respond to a distress call from a Kobliad freighter and find Ty Kajada, a security guard, and her prisoner, Rao Vantika. Kajada tells them Vantika started a fire on the ship in an effort to escape. Vantika dies and Bashir and Kira take Kajada back to Deep Space Nine, where she becomes convinced that he is still alive. He has faked his death many times before and Kajada has spent most of her adult life tracking him.\n\nBashir and Dax come to believe that Vantika's consciousness may be hiding in Kajada's brain without her knowledge. Vantika has indeed taken on another body, and he contacts Quark to hire Ferengi mercenaries to hijack an upcoming shipment of deuridium — a compound Kobliads desperately need to survive. Later, when Quark meets with the mercenaries, they are interrupted as Kajada falls from the second floor of Quark's bar while eavesdropping on them.\n\nIn the infirmary, Kajada reveals that the real Vantika pushed her. Dax finds a device under the dead Vantika's fingernails that he used to transfer his consciousness to someone else and tests Kajada for signs of the device's usage. Meanwhile, Quark and the mercenaries meet with the real Vantika, in the body of Bashir.\n\nOne step ahead of the crew's investigation, Vantika and the mercenaries manage to gain control of the freighter carrying the deuridium. The station traps the freighter in a tractor beam but Vantika threatens to destroy the freighter, along with Bashir's body. One of the mercenaries objects to such a plan, prompting Vantika to shoot him. Dax is able to disrupt Vantika's control of Bashir's body long enough for a confused Bashir to lower the freighter's shields and allow himself to be transported to the Infirmary. Once Vantika's consciousness is removed from Bashir's brain, Kajada destroys Vantika's stored consciousness and rids herself of him once and for all.\n\nIn 2016, \"Atlantic Classic Comics\" ranked \"The Passenger\" dead last in a ranking of all 173 episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\n\nIn 2019, ScreenRant ranked this episode one of the ten worst episodes of \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nin\"e.\n\n\n"}

Eventually her story was highlighted by noted writer-activist Mahasweta Devi in her book in Bengali, \"Byadhkhanda\" in (1994), ( \"The Book of the Hunter\" (2002)) \n\nBorn in 1965, in village Gohaldohi, in Paschim Medinipur district, West Bengal, into a poor Lodha family, Chuni Kotal survived a childhood of impoverishment to become the first woman from a 'primitive' tribe to complete High School. Thereafter, she got her first job as a Lodha Social worker in 1983 at Jhargram ITDP office, surveying local villages.\n\nEventually she graduated in anthropology from Vidyasagar University, in 1985. Two years after graduating, she was appointed as a Hostel superintendent at 'Rani Shiromoni SC and ST Girls' Hostel' at Medinipur, here again she had to face the social stigma attached with her tribe.\n\nTrouble really began for her when she joined the Masters course (M.Sc.) at the local Vidyasagar University. Here she was allegedly discriminated against university administrators, who refused to give her the requisite pass grades, despite her having fulfilled the criteria, who opined that a low-born person coming from a \"criminal tribe\", a Denotified tribe of India, hence did not have the social privilege and pre-ordained destiny to study \"higher discourse\" like the social sciences. In 1991, after losing two years at the course, she complained, and a high level enquiry commission was set up by the state Education minister to no avail, once the fact that she belonged to a former criminal tribe came to light.\n\nOn 14 August 1992, frustrated by years casteist and racist harassment at Medinipur, she left Medinipur and went to meet her husband, Manmatha Savar, who had been working at Railway workshop at Kharagpur. They had known each other since 1981 and later married in 1990 through a court marriage; Manmatha was a high school graduate himself. It was here that she committed suicide on 16 August 1992, at the age of 27.\n\nHer death became the focal point of immense political, human rights and social controversy in the media in West Bengal, and eastern India, where the discourse is traditionally Brahmin-Baniya dominated. However, her death did not receive the attention of Indian American social science professors as it did among Western social scientists who were studying the Indian caste system, like Professor Nicholas B. Dirks at Columbia University and Professor Jan Breman at the University of Amsterdam.\n\nUpon her death, Bangla Dalit Sahitya Sanstha, Kolkata, organized a mass movement through different seminars and street corners, street play protesting against university teachers, on the street of Kolkata. Since 1993, it organizes the Annual \"Chuni Kotal Memorial Lecture\" in Kolkata every year.

It covers the city of York, the eastern part of North Yorkshire, and most of the East Riding of Yorkshire.\n\nThe diocese is headed by the Archbishop of York and its cathedral is York Minster. The diocese is divided into three archdeaconries of Cleveland in the north (with a Bishop of Whitby), the East Riding (with a Bishop of Hull), and in the south-west the Archdeaconry of York (with a Bishop of Selby).\n\nThe diocese was once much larger, covering Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire and parts of Northumberland, Lancashire, Cumberland and Westmorland.\n\nThe diocesan Archbishop of York is primarily supported by three suffragan bishops: the Bishops of Hull (founded 1891), of Whitby (founded 1923) and of Selby (founded 1939). While not operating a formal area scheme, each suffragan takes informal responsibility for one archdeaconry (East Riding, Cleveland and York respectively). Alternative episcopal oversight (for parishes in the diocese who reject the ministry of priests who are women) is provided by the provincial episcopal visitor (PEV) the Bishop suffragan of Beverley; unlike in most dioceses, Beverley does not need to be licensed as an honorary assistant bishop since he is a suffragan in the diocese. Jonathan Frost, Dean of York and former Bishop of Southampton was licensed an honorary assistant bishop of the diocese with membership of the diocesan House of Bishops in March 2019.\n\nThere are six retired honorary assistant bishops licensed in the diocese:\n\nDavid James, retired Bishop of Bradford and Martin Wallace, retired Bishop suffragan of Selby, live in Beverley and Bridlington respectively, but there is no evidence that either has been licensed as an honorary assistant bishop.\n\nIn 1541, the archdeanery of Richmond, North Yorkshire, which included part of the Yorkshire Dales, North Lancashire (including Furness), the southern part of Westmorland and the ward of Allerdale above Derwent in Cumberland, became part of the new Diocese of Chester. (These areas later became parts of other dioceses.)\n\nIn 1836 the western part (corresponding broadly to the West Riding) was split into the Ripon diocese, which was later subdivided into the dioceses of Ripon and Leeds, Bradford, and Wakefield and now constitutes most of the Diocese of Leeds. In 1884 Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire became part of the new Diocese of Southwell, from which Derbyshire was split off again in 1927 to form the Diocese of Derby. In 1914 the Diocese of Sheffield, (covering South Yorkshire), was split off as an independent diocese.\n\nDavid Butterfield resigned as Archdeacon of the East Riding on 26 May 2014 in order to be collated as \"Archdeacon for Generous Giving and Stewardship\" that 23 June, a position he held until he retired on 1 July 2017.\n\nFrom 1972 to 2017 the Deanery of Hull was sub-divided into three Area Deaneries of Central and North Hull, East Hull, and West Hull.\n\n\n"}

For example, WiMAX uses a rate adaptation algorithm that adapts the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) according to the quality of the radio channel, and thus the bit rate and robustness of data transmission. The process of link adaptation is a dynamic one and the signal and protocol parameters change as the radio link conditions change—for example in High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) this can take place every 2 ms.\n\nAdaptive modulation systems invariably require some channel state information at the transmitter. This could be acquired in time division duplex systems by assuming the channel from the transmitter to the receiver is approximately the same as the channel from the receiver to the transmitter. Alternatively, the channel knowledge can also be directly measured at the receiver, and fed back to the transmitter. Adaptive modulation systems improve rate of transmission, and/or bit error rates, by exploiting the channel state information that is present at the transmitter. Especially over fading channels which model wireless propagation environments, adaptive modulation systems exhibit great performance enhancements compared to systems that do not exploit channel knowledge at the transmitter.\n\nIn HSDPA link adaptation is performed by:\n\nThus HSDPA adapts to achieve very high bit rates, of the order of 14 megabit/sec, on clear channels using 16-QAM and close to 1/1 coding rate. On noisy channels HSDPA adapts to provide reliable communications using QPSK and 1/3 coding rate but the information bit rate drops to about 2.4 megabit/sec.

Goff\n\nJohn William Goff, Sr. (January 1, 1848 – November 9, 1924) was an American lawyer and politician from New York.\n\nBorn in County Wexford, Goff emigrated with his family to the United States while still a child. The family settled in New York City, where Goff worked for ten years as a clerk in a dry goods store while attending night classes at Cooper Union. In 1865, he took a job as a junior clerk in an attorney's office and eventually was admitted to the bar.\n\nGoff was a committed Irish nationalist and in 1875 he played a prominent part in arranging for the rescue of six Fenian rebels imprisoned in a British penal colony in Western Australia. The seaborne expedition, which successfully evaded Royal Navy patrols, involving the New Bedford whaler \"Catalpa\", was popularly known as 'Goff's Irish Rescue Party'.\nIn 1888, Goff was appointed as Assistant New York County District Attorney by D.A. John R. Fellows. In November 1890, Goff ran on the County Democracy (the Anti-Tammany Democrats at the time) ticket to succeed Fellows, but was defeated by Tammany man De Lancey Nicoll.\n\nGoff became involved with work for the Society for the Prevention of Crime. There he made the acquaintance of the reforming clergyman Charles Henry Parkhurst, and as a result became prominent among the ranks of those critical of vice and police corruption in Manhattan. When Republican boss Thomas Platt, seeking political advantage over his enemies at Tammany Hall, arranged for the establishment of the Lexow Committee to investigate corruption in the Police Department (NYPD), Goff was appointed Chief Counsel to the committee. He interrogated corrupt police Commissioner John McClave, the notoriously brutal Inspector Alexander S. Williams and Superintendent Thomas F. Byrnes, the former head of the New York City Detective Bureau noted for giving his prisoners the \"Third Degree.\"\n\nThis led to his nomination by several Anti-Tammany organizations for Mayor of New York City in October 1894, but Goff declined to run for the office. He took the second place on the Anti-Tammany fusion ticket instead, and in November was elected Recorder of New York City. In November 1906, Goff was elected to the New York Supreme Court (1st D.) on the fusion ticket nominated jointly by Democrats and the Independence League, headed by Randolph Hearst for Governor. Goff remained on the bench until the end of 1918 when he reached the constitutional age limit.\n\nIn the course of his career on the New York bench, Goff presided over the first trial of Charles Becker, a police lieutenant charged with arranging the murder of a gambler named Herman Rosenthal (gambler). The trial, held in October 1912, was notable for the extreme speed at which Goff ran the proceedings, both the prosecution and the defence being heard in less than two weeks. Becker was found guilty, but the verdict was later reversed on appeal on the grounds that Goff had heavily favoured the prosecution. The verdict of the Court of Appeals, one of the most strongly worded in New York's history, went 6 to 1 against Goff and charged that 'haste seemed to become the essence of the trial'. Goff was also reprimanded for repeatedly denying the defence's requests for adjournments.\n\nIn retirement, Goff lived on a farm in upstate New York, where he raised herons. He was never a learned man - his politely-worded entry in the \"Dictionary of American Biography\" admits that \"he could never be described as a scholar\" - but was widely regarded, among his contemporaries, as the great terror of the New York City Bar Association. The criminal lawyer and Assistant District Attorney Newman Levy described him as \"the cruelest, most sadistic judge we have had in New York this century\" and, according to Andy Logan, the chronicler of the Becker case, \"distinguished members of the bar at the height of their careers confessed to waking up in their beds in a cold sweat, having heard in nightmares the sound of that low, sibilant voice saying 'Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, \"guilty\"!' - a verdict he pronounced, it seemed to them, with joy.\"\n\n\n"}

The shape is determined partly by aerodynamics; a capsule is aerodynamically stable falling blunt end first, which allows only the blunt end to require a heat shield for atmospheric entry. Its shape has also been compared to that of an old-fashioned automobile's headlight. A manned capsule contains the spacecraft's instrument panel, limited storage space, and seats for crew members. Because a capsule shape has little aerodynamic lift, the final descent is via parachute, either coming to rest on land, at sea, or by active capture by an aircraft. In contrast, the development of spaceplane reentry vehicles attempts to provide a more flexible reentry profile.\n\nReentry capsules have typically been smaller than in diameter due to launch vehicle aerodynamic requirements. The capsule design is both volumetrically efficient and structurally strong, so it is typically possible to construct small capsules of performance comparable to lifting body or spaceplane designs in all but lift-to-drag ratio for less cost. The Soyuz spacecraft is an example. Most capsules have used an ablative heat shield for reentry and been non-reusable. The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle appears likely, as of December 2005, to use a ten-times reusable capsule with a replaceable heat shield. There is no limit, save for lack of engineering experience, on using high-temperature ceramic tiles or ultra-high temperature ceramic sheets on reentry capsules.\n\nMaterials for the capsule are designed in different ways, like the Apollo command module’s aluminum honeycomb structure. Aluminum is very light, and the structure gives the capsule extra strength. The early spacecraft had a coating of glass embedded with synthetic resin and put in very high temperatures. Carbon fiber, reinforced plastics and ceramic are new materials that are constantly being made better for use in space exploration.\n\nMost reentry capsules have used an ablative heat shield for reentry and been non-reusable. The early spacecraft had a coating of glass embedded with synthetic resin and put in very high temperatures.\n\nReentry capsules are well-suited to high energy reentries. Capsules reenter aft-end first with the occupants lying down, as this is the optimum position for the human body to withstand the g-forces induced as the capsule impacts the atmosphere. The rounded shape (blunt body) of a capsule forms a shock wave that keeps most of the heat away from the heat shield, but a thermal protection system is still necessary. The space capsule must be strong enough to withstand reentry forces such as drag, and must reenter at a precise angle of attack to prevent a skip off the surface of the atmosphere or destructively high accelerations.\n\nWhen the reentry capsule comes through the atmosphere the capsule compresses the air in front of it, which heats up to very high temperatures. The surface temperature of a capsule can reach as it descends through the Earth's atmosphere. To prevent this heat from reaching interior structures, capsules are typically equipped with an ablative heat shield that melts and then vaporizes, removing the heat.\n\nThe Apollo command module reentered with the center of mass offset from the center line; this caused the capsule to assume an angled attitude through the air, providing lift that could be used for directional control. Reaction control system thrusters were used to steer the capsule by rotating the lift vector.\n\nParachutes are used for the final descent, sometimes augmented by braking rockets if the capsule is designed to land on the Earth's surface. Examples of land landing capsules include Vostok, Voskhod, Soyuz, Shenzhou and the Boeing CST-100 Starliner. Other capsules, such as Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Orion, and Dragon, splash down in the ocean.\n\nCapsules are well-suited to high-temperature and dynamic loading reentries. Whereas delta-wing gliders such as the Space Shuttle can reenter from Low Earth Orbit, and lifting bodies are capable of entry from as far away as the Moon, it is rare to find designs for reentry vehicles from Mars that are not capsules. The current RKK Energia design for the Kliper, being capable of flights to Mars, is an exception.\n\nEngineers building a reentry capsule must take forces such as gravity and drag into consideration. The capsule must be strong enough to slow down quickly, must endure extremely high or low temperatures, and must survive the landing. When the capsule comes close to a planet's or moon's surface, it has to slow down at a very exact rate. If it slows down too quickly, everything in the capsule will be crushed. If it doesn’t slow down quickly enough, it will crash into the surface and be destroyed. There are additional requirements for atmospheric reentry. If the angle of attack is too shallow, the capsule may skip off the surface of the atmosphere. If the angle of attack is too steep, the deceleration forces may be too high or the heat of reentry may exceed the tolerances of the heat shield.\n\nCapsules reenter aft-end first with the occupants lying down, as this is the optimum position for the human body to withstand the decelerative g-force. The aft end is formed in a rounded shape (blunt body), as this forms a shock wave that doesn't touch the capsule, and the heat is deflected away rather than melting the vehicle.\n\nThe Apollo Command Module reentered with the center of mass offset from the center line; this caused the capsule to assume an angled attitude through the air, providing a sideways lift to be used for directional control. Rotational thrusters were used to steer the capsule under either automatic or manual control by changing the lift vector.\n\nAt lower altitudes and speeds parachutes are used to slow the capsule down by making more drag.\n\nCapsules also have to be able to withstand the impact when they reach the Earth's surface. All US crewed capsules (Mercury, Gemini, Apollo) would land on water; the Soviet/Russian Soyuz and Chinese Shenzhou (and planned US, Russian, Indian) creweded capsules uses small rockets to touch down on land. In the lighter gravity of Mars, airbags were sufficient to land some of the robotic missions safely.\n\nTwo of the biggest external forces that a reentry capsule experiences are gravity and drag.\n\nDrag is the capsule's resistance to it moving through air. Air is a mixture of different molecules, including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide. Anything falling through air hits these molecules and therefore slows down. The amount of drag on a capsule depends on many things, including the density of the air, and the shape, mass, diameter and roughness of the capsule. The speed of a spacecraft highly depends on the combined effect of the two forces — gravity, which can speed up a rocket, and drag, which will slow down the rocket. Capsules entering Earth's atmosphere will be considerably slowed because our atmosphere is so thick.\n\nWhen the capsule comes through the atmosphere, it compresses the air in front of it which heats up to very high temperatures (contrary to popular belief friction is not significant).\n\nA good example of this is a shooting star. A shooting star, which is usually tiny, creates so much heat coming through the atmosphere that the air around the meteorite glows white hot. So when a huge object like a capsule comes through, even more heat is created.\n\nAs the capsule slows down, the compression of the air molecules hitting the capsules surface creates a lot of heat. The surface of a capsule can get to 1480 °C (2700 F) as it descends through the Earth's atmosphere. All this heat has to be directed away. Reentry capsules are typically coated with a material that melts and then vaporizes (\"ablation\"). It may seem counterproductive, but the vaporization takes heat away from the capsule. This keeps the reentry heat from getting inside the capsule. Capsules see a more intense heating regime than spaceplanes and ceramics such as used on the Space Shuttle are usually less suitable, and all capsules have used ablation.\n\nIn practice, capsules do create a significant and useful amount of lift. This lift is used to control the trajectory of the capsule, allowing reduced g-forces on the crew, as well as reducing the peak heat transfer into the capsule. The longer the vehicle spends at high altitude, the thinner the air is and the less heat is conducted. For example, the Apollo CM had a lift to drag ratio of about 0.35. In the absence of any lift the Apollo capsule would have been subjected to about 20g deceleration (8g for low-Earth-orbiting spacecraft), but by using lift the trajectory was kept to around 4g.\n\nThe reentry capsule is the \"middle\" module of the three-part Soyuz or Shenzhou spacecraft – the orbital module is located at the front of the spacecraft, with the service or equipment module attached to the rear. A feature in the landing system allows the use of a single parachute and \"braking rocket\", thus the heatshield is dropped from the spacecraft similar to the landing bag deployment on the U.S. Mercury spacecraft. Like the Command Module of the Apollo spacecraft, the Shenzhou reentry capsule has no reusable capabilities; each spacecraft is flown once and then \"thrown away\" (usually sent to museums).\n\nFew details are known about the Shenzhou reentry capsule, except that it uses some technology from the Soyuz TM design. The new Soyuz TMA spacecraft, now used solely for International Space Station flights, had its couches modified to allow for taller crewmembers to fly, and features \"glass cockpit\" technology similar to that found on the Space Shuttle and newer commercial and military aircraft.\n\nThe former Soviet Union suffered two disasters, and one near-disaster, all three involving the capsule during the de-orbit and reentry. Soyuz 1 ended in disaster when the parachutes failed to deploy and the capsule smashed into the earth at speeds over , killing cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov. Soyuz 5 almost ended in disaster, when the reentry capsule entered the atmosphere nose first – attributed to a failure of the service module to separate similar to that on the Vostok 1 flight. Luckily, the service module was burned off and the capsule righted itself.\n\nSoyuz 11 ended in disaster in 1971 when an equalization valve, used to equalize air pressure during the Soyuz final descent, prematurely opened in the vacuum of space, killing the three crew members, who were not wearing spacesuits. Subsequent flights, from Soyuz 12 to Soyuz 40, utilized a two-man crew because the third seat had to be removed for the pressure suit controls. The Soyuz-T version restored the third seat.\n\n\n\n"}

It started when Johnny Ramone was confronted with the idea of a tribute album and was asked if he wanted to participate, to which he agreed, as long as he would have full control over the project. He was able to get Rob Zombie as a co-producer, and call upon different bands to participate. Rob Zombie also did the cover artwork, and Stephen King, a Ramones fan, wrote the liner notes.\n\nOne of the last things Johnny Ramone did was oversee the album.

{"id": "2321037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321037", "title": "Cox's sandpiper", "text": "Cox's sandpiper\n\nCox's sandpiper (\"Calidris\" × \"paramelanotos\") is a hybrid between a male pectoral sandpiper (\"Calidris melanotos\") and a female curlew sandpiper (\"Calidris ferruginea\"). First discovered in Australia in the 1950s, it was originally described as a species new to science and named after Australian ornithologist John B. Cox. However, it was later found to be a hybrid. Most if not all birds found to date are males, in accord with Haldane's rule.\n\nThe first Cox's sandpiper was recorded in Australia in 1955. Observers initially identified the birds as dunlins (\"Calidris alpina\"), but as additional birds were discovered — particularly in the period between 1968 and 1975 — doubts were cast on the initial identifications. By 1986, at least 20 such birds had been observed along the continent's southern and eastern coasts, though no consensus existed about their identity; among the theories postulated were that the birds were aberrant individuals or a previously undescribed subspecies of the dunlin, or that they were a stereotyped hybrid (meaning that all birds of some hybrid parentage appear near-identical). In order to help resolve the problem of the birds' identity John Cox collected two specimens, one in 1975 and another in 1977, and deposited them at the South Australian Museum. Thinking that the birds might be \"Cooper's sandpipers\" (see below), the two specimens were sent to the American Museum of Natural History in 1977 for comparison with the type specimen from which that form was named; replies indicated that the birds were not of the same species. A live bird was caught and photographed in 1981, and, in 1982, Shane Parker formally described the bird as a new species.\n\nFollowing Parker's description, the view that these birds represented a good species (as opposed to aberrant individuals or hybrids) gained some ground; the 'species' was listed in the Shorebirds volume of the Helm Identification Guides, for example, although with a note indicating that the possibility of hybrid origin could not be ruled out.\n\nCox's sandpipers are similar in size and shape to pectoral sandpipers and sharp-tailed sandpipers (\"Calidris acuminata\"). The bill is fairly long, blackish and slightly drooping, sometimes with a yellowish base; the legs are dull brownish-green in colour. The birds' wings at rest extend just slightly beyond the tail.\n\nCox's sandpiper has never been observed in breeding plumage. All mature specimens that have been observed have been in non-breeding plumage, although some have started to acquire a few breeding-plumage feathers. In non-breeding plumage, birds are brown-grey above and white below, with a brown-grey breast-band and no flank-streaks. When hints of a breeding plumage are acquired, a rusty tinge develops on the breast and ear-coverts, some flank streaks appear, and on the upper parts the non-breeding-plumaged feathers are replaced by feathers with black centres, grey tips and buff or pale chestnut fringes.\n\nJuvenile Cox's sandpipers are known from only two individuals, one from Massachusetts and one from Japan, both believed to be Cox's sandpiper based on their morphology, but not identified with certainty. These birds closely resembled juvenile pectoral sandpipers, but without a well-demarcated breast-band (although the Japanese bird showed strong streaking on the breast-sides). In this plumage, the birds also showed large amounts of white on the uppertail-coverts.\n\nCooper's sandpiper, \"\"Calidris\"\" × \"cooperi\" was described (as \"Tringa cooperi\") by Spencer Fullerton Baird in 1858 based on a specimen collected on Long Island, New York, in May 1833 and deposited at the American Museum of Natural History. It was named after the conchologist William Cooper, who collected the bird.\n\nWhen John Cox examined slides of the specimen in February 1988, he found a number of features in common with the Australian birds. The birds appeared to be of the same size and structure, with several plumage features in common including a heavily streaked head and neck with a rusty wash, a split supercilium, and identically-patterned upperparts feathers. Although the bill of the Cooper's specimen was straight (compared to the drooping bill of Cox's), this could be due to damage and distortion. The birds do differ insofar as that the Cooper's specimen has a spotted, not streaked breast. This could be accounted for by the plumage stage, given the differences in the times of year when the specimens were collected; also, some of the Cox's sandpipers seen in Australia have had similar underparts markings to the Cooper's specimen. Nonetheless, those that have directly compared the Cooper's and Cox's sandpipers feel that they are not identical.\n\nMost records to date have come from the more heavily populated south and south-east of Australia.\n\nA mysterious juvenile \"Calidris\" sandpiper was encountered on Duxbury Beach, Plymouth Bay, Massachusetts, United States, in September, 1987, and was tentatively identified as a Cox's sandpiper. The bird was observed in the field, and also trapped and examined in the hand as well as banded. Several accounts of this individual were published.\n\nIn late August, 2001, another juvenile \"Calidris\" showing features of both pectoral and curlew sandpipers was found at Shintone, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. An account of this bird, illustrated with photographs, was published in the British journal Birding World. This bird was believed to be another juvenile \"Cox's sandpiper\".\n\nThe birds were conclusively shown to be hybrids by Christidis \"et al.\" (1996). They analyzed 3 specimens of Cox's sandpiper and found that the mtDNA sequence of the cytochrome \"b\" gene was identical to that of Curlew sandpipers, while allozyme variation fit the pattern seen in curlew and pectoral sandpipers, but neither agreed with that of other proposed parent species (sharp-tailed sandpiper, white-rumped sandpiper, and ruff). Since mtDNA is inherited only from the mother, they concluded that the parentage of Cox's sandpipers was a male pectoral and a female curlew sandpiper.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2321039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321039", "title": "She's Out of My Life", "text": "She's Out of My Life\n\n\"She's Out of My Life\" is a song written by American songwriter Tom Bahler and performed by American singer Michael Jackson. The song was released as the fourth single from Jackson's 1979 album \"Off the Wall\" released on April 19, 1980. In 2004, the song appeared in \"The Ultimate Collection\". It peaked at No. 10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, marking the first time any solo artist had ever achieved four Top 10 hits from one album. In America, it earned a million-selling Gold 45. Unlike the album's previous singles, which were all uptempo dance-oriented funk and disco songs, \"She's Out of My Life\" was an emotional ballad. The song has a tempo of 66 beats per minute, making it one of Jackson's slowest songs.\n\nThe song is about a painful breakup. It has been claimed that Bahler wrote the song about Karen Carpenter, whom Bahler had briefly dated. However, he has stated, \"The fact is, I had already written that song by the time Karen and I became romantic. That song was written more about Rhonda Rivera... Rhonda and I had been together for two years, and it was after we broke up that I started dating Karen.\"\n\nThe demo version of the song, which features Jackson singing with a guitar, was released on the second disc of the 2009 album \"Michael Jackson's This Is It\". The song has also been covered by a variety of artists, including Patti LaBelle, Shirley Bassey, Ginuwine, 98°, S Club 7, Barbara Mandrell, Daniel Evans, Nina, Willie Nelson, Josh Groban, Gloria Lynne, and Karel Gott.\n\nJones had originally intended to save the song for Frank Sinatra. However, he wanted Jackson to record material with more mature themes and \"feel the full range of his voice,\" so he decided to bring the song to Jackson's attention.\n\nA poignant moment in the song occurs near the end when Jackson begins to break down in tears as he sings the word \"life\". Although he had attempted to record the song's last few moments with emotional restraint, after numerous tries he continued to end the rendition the same - by breaking down in tears. Producer Quincy Jones subsequently let Jackson's tearful recording stand:\n\"She's Out of My Life\", I'd been carrying around for about three years—you can feel the pain in it, you know. And I held on to it and finally something said 'this is the right moment to give it to Michael'.\n\nAnd when we recorded it with Michael, I know it was an experience he'd never even thought about to sing in a song, 'cause it's a very mature emotion. And he cried at the end of every take, you know. We recorded about—I don't know—8-11 takes, and every one at the end, he just cried, and I said 'hey - that's supposed to be, leave it on there.'\n\n—Quincy Jones, \"Off the Wall\" 2001 Special Edition, \"Quincy Jones Interview 3\"\nIn Jackson's autobiography, \"Moonwalk\", he wrote that the song is about knowing that barriers separating him from others are seemingly easy to overcome, yet they cause him to miss out on what he really desires. He said that he cried from the sudden effect of the words because \"I had been letting so much build up inside me.\" Particularly it reminded him of his feeling of being \"so rich in some experiences while being poor in moments of true joy.\" He worried about this feeling showing up on the song, but also felt \"if it touched people's heartstrings, knowing that would make me feel less lonely.\" He described making \"Off the Wall\" as \"one of the most difficult periods of my life...I had very few close friends at the time and felt very isolated.\" He would walk through his neighborhood, hoping to meet people who didn't know who he was, so he could meet \"somebody who would be my friend because they liked me and needed a friend too, not because I was who I am.\"\n\nThe song peaked at #10 in the United States on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The single was even more successful in the UK and peaked at number 3 on the charts (the equivalent position reached by \"Off the Wall's\" debut single \"Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough\").\n\nGiven the popular response to his emotional rendition, the song remained in Jackson's live set for many years.\n\nAllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the song an \"overwrought ballad\" but praised Jackson's \"blindingly gifted\" singing on the track. Rolling Stone editor Stephen Holden praised: \"The singer's ultradramatic phrasing, which takes huge emotional risks and wins every time, wrings the last drop of pathos from Tom Bahler's tear-jerker, \"She's Out of My Life.\"\n\nA music video was produced to promote the song, which showed Michael in a blue-green shirt, dark pants, and sitting on a barstool with a spotlight shining behind him. The video uses a split screen technique to simultaneously show Jackson from two different angles during the second and third verses. It was directed by Bruce Gowers, who also directed a similar video for Jackson's previous single \"Rock with You.\" The video is shown far less frequently than Jackson's later videos, but it is included on the DVD box set \"Michael Jackson's Vision\", marking its first DVD release. It was parodied in the Dr. PC Man video \"Three Minutes Hour Life\".\n\nThe song was performed during The Jacksons' Triumph Tour and Victory Tour. It was also performed on Jackson's Bad World Tour, the Dangerous World Tour, and the Royal Brunei concert, which also turned out to be the final live performance of the song, as whilst it was rehearsed for the History World Tour, it was removed from the setlist just before the tour began. The song was also rehearsed as a duet with a female backup vocalist for the first \"Michael Jackson & Friends\" charity concert in Seoul, South Korea, but cancelled for the final performance, which took place ten years to the day before Jackson's death.\n\nUsually during these performances, Jackson would bring a female audience member up on stage with him while performing the song. Before concluding the song, he would often pause briefly to physically display distress, which he amplified by shielding his face and acting as if he were crying.\n\nThe live performances of the song were featured on the \"\", \"\", and \"\" DVDs. Live audio is available in the \"Live at Wembley July 16, 1988\" CD, included as a bonus on \"Bad 25\", and the 1981 live album, \"The Jacksons Live!\"\n\n\n\n\nJohnny Duncan and Janie Fricke recorded a duet version reworked as \"He's Out Of My Life\", and in 1980 their version reached the top 20 of the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2321041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321041", "title": "Gravity (Our Lady Peace album)", "text": "Gravity (Our Lady Peace album)\n\nGravity is the fifth studio album by the Canadian rock band Our Lady Peace. It was released on June 18, 2002 by Columbia Records in North America. The album became a worldwide success, charting highly both in Canada and the United States with the hit singles \"Somewhere Out There\" and \"Innocent\".\n\nThe album title, \"Gravity\", was inspired by the chorus lyrics \"Falling back to me, defying gravity\" from the track \"Somewhere Out There\". At the time of the album's release, OLP drummer Jeremy Taggart said that \"Gravity\" was \"by far [their] best album\".\n\n\"Gravity\" was the first album to feature new guitarist, Steve Mazur, who replaced Mike Turner in 2002 after the latter's departure, due to the band feeling limited by Mike Turner's guitar abilities in the studio. Despite Turner's departure, he appears on half the tracks on the album, having recorded parts for several songs prior to his departure. This was also their last album with musician Jamie Edwards, who had performed on two prior albums and was briefly an official member, but left the band soon after the album's completion.\n\nIt is the band's first album not to be produced by their original producer, Arnold Lanni, who produced the band's previous four studio albums. The band originally wanted Lanni to produce their fifth album but he was busy working with Simple Plan and the band instead chose Bob Rock; he also produced their next album.\n\nThe album was originally to be a live album based on the Spiritual Machines tour with three new tracks, however, Bob Rock then asked the band if they would like to work on an entire full-length studio album which the band accepted.\n\nAfter wrapping up the \"Spiritual Machines\" Tour in late 2001, Our Lady Peace were becoming restless and close to breaking up. Lead singer Raine Maida in particular was feeling limited by guitarist Mike Turner's abilities in the studio. Raine would later state in an interview, \"I don't know if Mike was born to be a guitar player. The studio was a tough place for him and we were working too hard to make up for it – we felt like we were cheating ourselves. Four albums is way too fucking long to put up with that. I'm sure he'll do great things, just not with six-stringed instruments. They mutually decided to part ways following preliminary sessions for the album.\n\nThe band decided that they had gone as far as they could go musically with \"Spiritual Machines\". Looking to reinvigorate themselves and change directions musically, they sought a more stripped down sound as opposed to the multiple layers and textures of their previous albums. It was this idea of simplifying that inspired the title of \"Gravity\". Raine discussed the transition in a 2002 interview. \"’Spiritual Machines’ was so out there in talking about the future and trying to perceive man turning into machine, it was very heavy. With this record...it kind of felt like we were being pulled back down to earth, hence the title. It's such a simple life out there [Hawaii, where most of \"Gravity\" was recorded] and because of that the album was just based around living day to day rather than looking too far ahead. In that sense ‘Gravity’ is pretty much the opposite of ‘Spiritual Machines’. None of our other albums had been concept records, so it was the right time for us to get away from that whole philosophy. Because of that ‘Gravity’ is probably the most basic album we’ve made since our first.\"\n\nAlthough Raine Maida had begun living in Los Angeles, The band came together in Toronto to start writing new material towards the end of touring for \"Spiritual Machines\". They did it this time without the usual help of producer Arnold Lanni, who at the time was working with fellow Canadian band and management-mates Simple Plan on their debut album, \"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls\". Jamie Edwards was credited for the first and last time as a songwriter on this album. Three songs written by the band made the record but most were written by Maida during the 2001 holiday season. Steve Mazur's late official entry into the band meant he took no part in songwriting.\n\nFor this album, Our Lady Peace sought a new producer rather than long-time collaborator Arnold Lanni to help with their search for a new sound. According to the band, it was Lanni's idea for them to pursue a new venue lest they regret not trying other producers later on. After visiting with several producers in Los Angeles including Josh Abraham, the band seized the opportunity to work with Bob Rock because they liked his work with artists such as Metallica and American Hi-Fi as well as his general passion for music. Raine was particularly convinced he wanted to work with Rock after watching \"A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica\", the documentary about the making of the Black Album. In the studio, they would even record with the same guitars and amplifiers used by Metallica as well as Pete Townshend and The Cult. They first visited Rock's studio in September 2001 to meet him and even wrote and recorded a song while there.\n\nThey flew to Hawaii in November 2001 to Rock's studio in Maui after their last live show of the season at Music without Borders. They had initially booked ten days of studio time that month to record three tracks that would be included on a live album based on the \"Spiritual Machines\" tour. They began recording on the day of their arrival, laying down the initial tracks for \"A Story About a Girl\", which was written on the spot within 20 minutes after Raine heard Duncan and Jeremy tuning up in the next room. According to Taggart, the making of that song set the pace for the whole album. \"He saw us as a rock band as soon as we got there, and the way we recorded it was live off the floor as a rock band as opposed to layering things,\" Maida stated. \"He was a great leader who got the best out of us immediately\". Metallica was originally scheduled to begin work on a new album with Rock in the following months but this was postponed when front man James Hetfield checked himself into rehab for alcohol abuse. Rock then asked the band if they would like to work on an entire album, which they accepted.\n\nFollowing preliminary recording sessions in Maui, Mike Turner left the band in December 2001 after recording rhythm guitar parts for several songs that would appear on the album. Band members in interviews said that he and the band weren't seeing eye to eye anymore but according to official press releases the split was amicable. Duncan Coutts said of the split, \"We weren't allowing him to do what he really wanted to do, and he wasn't playing what we wanted to hear. ... This recording process magnified that, but it was a long time coming.\" The remaining band members then commenced a 2-month public search during which the band received thousands of demo tapes, videos and CDs from all over the world, including Australia and Japan. They chose Detroit native, Steve Mazur, who Coutts and Taggart knew through mutual friends in Los Angeles. After his inception into the band was announced in April, Raine Maida noted: \"[It] felt like a cohesive unit...It just felt incredible. It felt like a new band, totally fresh.\"\n\nDuring the band's holiday break from recording, Raine received a phone call from Rock on Christmas Eve, asking him if he had anymore song ideas to consider before they returned to the Maui studio in January. The call prompted him to write seven songs over the next ten days. Upon returning to the studio, sections from two of Maida's demos were combined to form the hit song, \"Somewhere Out There\" at Rock's suggestion. Maida explained \"It was like a last minute song done really quickly. I demoed a bunch of songs over Christmas, when we had a break for 10 days. I wrote, like, seven songs and brought them back. Bob listened to all seven songs and then listened to song number three halfway through and song number six halfway through and said, 'OK,' told the engineer to stop the CD, and got us to go put the verse from song three and the chorus from song six together and was like, 'That's the song.'\"\n\nFor the ten weeks they were in Maui recording (spread over 4 months), the band lived together and would surf and ride mountain bikes in the mornings then work on the album in the evening, usually recording one song in one day and only for a couple of hours before and after dinner. \"Leaving Toronto and holing up in a beach house in Maui was a very important step for us,\" explained Duncan Coutts. \"We lived, ate, and breathed music together away from all distractions.\" The band recorded most of the album at Rock's Plantation Studio in Haiku, Hawaii and finished recording and mixing with Randy Staub at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, B.C. in March 2002.\n\nThe track \"Made of Steel\" was recorded three separate times during the sessions with the last take being used. \"Do You Like It\" was not recorded until after most of the mixing had been completed in Vancouver. According to Raine, \"We had gone back to Maui to finish some small details on the last two songs to be mixed and 'lo and behold!' a new song was born and recorded.\"\n\nThe recording technique for this album began a trend of recording songs live in the studio together with minimal overdubs that continued on their later albums. According to the band, doing it live works to create a more realistic set of sounds, \"a vibe\" reminiscent of Led Zeppelin or early David Bowie, mistakes and all. In earlier albums, they would record each instrument separately and at different times. They began recording \"Bring Back the Sun\" before the lyrics were even finished. The final version as heard on the album is only the second take of the song, live to tape, with strings overdubbed.\n\nRaine stated his intent for the album's sound, \"Basically what he [Rock] did with Metallica on the 'black record', we talked and wanted to take that kind of approach. Let him simplify stuff. Let him take away... We always usually try add as many layers as we can to our music, and Bob said, 'Let's try to add not so many.'\" The goal was also to make the album's sound more akin to what the band sounded live and to make the songs easier to reproduce on stage. \"We'd record a song, sit back and ask, 'Why isn't this sounding like everyone is hearing it in their heads?' Bob would say 'let's simplify the drums,' or 'let's make that bass line simpler.' He was able to pull out why we didn't sound on albums like we do live.\"\n\nRaine said in an interview that most of the lyrics on \"Gravity\" were rewritten because producer Bob Rock felt that the songs would be stronger with simpler lyrics, so that listeners could understand what Raine was talking about. \"I was really open to him musically, but I wasn't ready to be challenged lyrically like he challenged me. He kept telling me to rewrite stuff because he didn't understand what I was trying to convey in my lyrics. He would say, 'Raine, I don't have a fucking clue what you're talking about. Convince me. Explain to me what you're trying to say in your lyrics better.' I would keep rewriting and rewriting, and sometimes I felt I would never please him. I would say, 'Jesus, I don't know what you're asking me to do here. I don't think I can do whatever it is you want.' He would say, 'Yes, you can, get back in there.' And I did it. Looking back now, I'm a better writer for it.\" The stress caused by this challenge eventually led to Raine having to go to a hospital; contracting shingles. Raine had also cited his and his wife Chantal Kreviazuk's recent trips to Iraq with War Child Canada as inspiration to simplify his lyrics and to 'get to the point'. The results were considered some of Raine's most personal lyrics to date while others lamented the loss of Maida's more ambiguous lyrical style.\n\nThe album was originally planned to be released on June 11 but was pushed to June 18 because the artwork was not ready in time.\n\n\"Gravity\" debuted at #2 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling close to 25,000 copies in Canada in its first week. The album debuted at #9 in the United States, making it the band's highest position in the United States yet. By October 2002, it had been certified Gold by the RIAA in the U.S. and on November 23 of that year won a CASBY Award for Best New Album. By November 2003, \"Gravity\" had been certified double-platinum in Canada (200,000 units).\n\nOn November 26, 2002 a deluxe limited edition version of the album was released as part of the Sound Plus Collector's Series. This version, with a different cover, came with a special bonus DVD of live tracks and the music videos for \"Somewhere Out There\" and \"Innocent\" (see below) as well as footage from the \"Gravity\" tour. The back cover states that the live tracks were recorded on the \"Spiritual Machines\" Tour of 2001. The following text is also included:\n\nDespite its success, reviews from critics were mixed to negative. They said the album developed a more extreme \"mainstream sound\" and was \"overproduced\" in order to appeal to the American market, this may have been partly due to new producer Bob Rock of Aerosmith and Metallica fame. Some reviewers went as far to call it a \"plea for mainstream American acceptance.\" On the other hand, one publication said the album was noteworthy for its simple, direct approach. A reviewer from \"Vue Weekly\" stated that \"It sounds like a brand new band, but the jury is out on whether it’s better.\" \"Gravity\" was a big change from their last successful album, \"Happiness... Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch\". Vocalist Raine Maida's signature falsetto is scarce on the album, with his overall tone changing as well or as a reviewer from \"Kludge\" put it, \"Gravity is almost completely void of Raine Maida’s urgent, almost-squaking, one-of-a-kind vocals and, save three tracks, almost any sense of creativity.\" Andrew Bonazelli of CMJ New Music Monthly criticized the album's \"soul-deadening production\" as well as string arrangements for several songs being a \"contrived lunge towards accessibility.\"\n\nIn the June 22 issue of \"Billboard\", Larry Flick wrote: \"Gravity is a giant leap forward...emerging with a crisp, highly commercial collection of guitar-driven jams.\" That sentiment was shared by \"Guitar World\"'s Gary Graff who praised the record in the magazine's August 2002 issue: \"...OLP have turned in an album more streamlined and punchy than their previous recordings. Most impressive is the wide assortment of styles here -- a tuneful anthem ('Innocent'), crunchy metal ('All for You') and spacey prog ('Bring Back the Sun') -- with which OLP defy the 'gravity' that personnel changes can have on a band.\"\n\nWith the mainstream success of \"Gravity\" and \"Somewhere Out There\", Our Lady Peace's fan base was split between fans of the new material and fans of the old material who, like several critics, cited the band's new direction as sell-out tactic. In 2010, online music magazine Popmatters looked back on the rift saying:\nRecently, \"Gravity\"`s single \"Innocent\" received widespread media attention when \"American Idol\" winner David Cook performed it on the program. Many, including \"American Idol\" judges, criticized both Cook's performance and song choice. Vocalist Raine Maida reportedly contacted Cook and they have since written some songs together.\n\nTwo songs from the \"Gravity\" sessions were used in World Wrestling Entertainment. The song \"Not Enough\" was used to make a WWE \"Desire\" tribute video to Jeff Hardy and Lita. \"Whatever\", a song not released on the album, was used as WWE wrestler Chris Benoit's entrance theme from 2002 until his death in 2007.\n\nThe lead single for \"Gravity\" was \"Somewhere Out There\", released on April 5, 2002. Four versions of the single were released. In the United States and Canada (SAMPCS11757), a one-track promotional CD was sent to radio stations only. In Australia and Europe, where the single was commercially released respectively on September 9 and 16, 2002 (Columbia 672965 2), three live bonus tracks, \"Starseed\", \"Whatever\", and \"4 AM\" were included. They were recorded in June 2001 in Syracuse, New York during the Spiritual Machines tour. \"4 AM\" is sung entirely by the audience. The fourth version (Columbia 79943) contains the live version of \"Bring Back the Sun\". \"Somewhere Out There\" became one of Our Lady Peace's most successful singles, generating the most chart activity of any of their songs released to radio. The song reached #7 on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart, their highest on that chart since \"Clumsy\" in 1998. The song also became their second number one in the Canadian Singles Chart peaking at number one and becoming a massive success in Canada.\n\nThe second single, \"Innocent\", was released to radio during August 2002. It was commercially released in Europe and Australia with the live tracks \"Naveed\", \"4 AM\" and a live cover of John Lennon's \"Imagine\" as well as the music video for \"Innocent\". Innocent was also a massive hit in Canada as well peaking at number 2 in the Canadian Singles Chart. The live tracks from this single and \"Somewhere out There\" were included on the limited edition releases of \"Gravity\". While not as successful as the first single, \"Innocent\" achieved minor success with its music video. The song received some attention in 2008 when American Idol contestant David Cook, who revealed himself to be a huge OLP fan, sang it on the show. Raine Maida and he have since written together.\n\nThe third and final single, \"Made of Steel\", was released only to radio on January 11, 2003. It made no appearance on any charts.\n\nThe band discussed the release of more singles from the album such as the popular \"Not Enough\" but single releases after \"Made of Steel\" were supplanted by those from the 2003 \"Live\" album, which included a live version of \"Not Enough\".\n\nOur Lady Peace embarked on one of their biggest tours in support of \"Gravity\" a month before the album's release. For most of the tour, Mike Eisenstein of the band Letters to Cleo joined the band as a stunt musician following Jamie Edwards' departure in April due to creative and personal differences. They opened on May 15, 2002 in Dayton, Ohio where many of the songs from \"Gravity\" were premiered.\n\nThey followed this up with appearances at various music festivals across the United States including Pointfest in St. Louis, Missouri. The tour continued through September 2002 dipping in and out of Canada with the bands Ash, Greenwheel and Audiovent opening for many shows. For most of November the band toured in Europe, their first visit to Europe since 1998. Touring resumed in January 2003 with a Canadian arena tour dubbed \"Fear of the Trailer Park\". Opening for Our Lady Peace were management-mates Finger Eleven as well as comedy troupe Trailer Park Boys and South African band Seether. The band's arena shows in Calgary and Edmonton would be recorded and released as their first official \"Live\" album later that year.\n\nThey returned to Europe in March as an opening act for Avril Lavigne. During this leg of the tour two new songs, \"Not Afraid\" and \"Talk is Cheap\" were premiered. \"Not Afraid\" would later be recorded for and rejected from their following studio album, \"Healthy in Paranoid Times\". Following the European tour, the band took off most of June 2003 to begin recording \"Healthy...\" and resumed touring throughout America for the rest of the year with 3 Doors Down opening for the majority of the shows. The tour concluded in September 2003.\n\nAll lyrics written by Raine Maida; all music written by Our Lady Peace.\nThe four live tracks were also released on a promo CD.\n\n\nAccording to Jeremy Taggart, twelve songs were completed (including mixing) for the album but two (\"Angelina's Song\" and \"Stop Screaming\") were cut off at the last minute. Duncan Coutts stated in an interview that six songs written by the band including Mike Turner and Jamie Edwards were recorded while only three (\"All For You\", \"Bring Back the Sun\" and \"A Story About a Girl\") made the final cut for the album.\n\nIn the midst of touring in October 2002, Our Lady Peace briefly returned to Bob Rock's studio in Maui to finish two songs left off of \"Gravity\" for an upcoming soundtrack. Maida mentioned on the band's website that they are both riff based songs that probably sound closer to \"Whatever\" than anything else. One of these songs was \"Our Time Is Fading\" a.k.a. \"The End Always Comes Last\", which was one of the last songs written with Mike Turner. The song never made the soundtrack and a studio version was never released but the song was played live multiple times and a live version was released on the \"Live\" album in 2003.\n\nAs listed in liner notes.\n\nMusicians\n\nAdditional string arrangements by Bob Buckley\n\nProduction\n\nAlbum\nCertifications\n\n"}

Published in 1956, it was recorded by Perry Como and went to #1 on the \"Billboard\" pop music chart in March of that year and reached #4 on the British charts in May.. The song's melody is almost identical in melody and triple-time rhythm to a portion of Emmanuel Chabrier's 1883 composition, \"España\".\n\nPerry Como's recording was done at Webster Hall in New York City. The conductor was Mitchell Ayres and the producer was Joe Carlton. The back-up vocals were provided by the Ray Charles Singers.\n\nThe nonsense phrase of the song's title, repeated throughout the song, is used as counterpoint to the lines it precedes in the lyrics, as in the following excerpt:\n\nAt the end of the song, Como exclaimed \"HOT DOG!!!!\" before the last two chords.\n\nThe phrase \"hot diggity dog!\" dates to at least 1928, when Al Jolson was recorded saying \"Hot diggity dog! Hot kitty! Hot pussycat! Didn't I tell you you'd love it?\" after a performance of the tune \"There's a Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder\".\n\nThe song is briefly heard in the extended DVD cut of the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Airport '07\", during \"Peter Griffin's Champagne Dance Party\" (a parody of \"The Lawrence Welk Show\"). It is also briefly heard in \"Call the Midwife\", Series 1 Episode 6, set in late 1957.\n\nIn the late 1970s a version with revised lyrics was used as a TV jingle for Oscar Mayer.\n\nIn the mid 1980s and early 1990s, respectively, the song was used in Wendy's and McDonald's advertising campaigns in Canada and the UK to promote their new range of hot dogs.\n\nIn the sixth episode of the first season of \"Doom Patrol\", the main antagonist of the series, Mr. Nobody, is shown to have orchestrated a plan in the 1950s which involved a giant balloon shaped like buttocks and playing the song on an attached jukebox repeatedly, sending people insane within 20 minutes.\n"}
{"id": "2321056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321056", "title": "Bandurria", "text": "Bandurria\n\nThe bandurria is a plucked chordophone from Spain, similar to the mandolin, primarily used in Spanish folk music, but also found in former Spanish colonies.\n\nPrior to the 18th century, the bandurria had a round back, similar or related to the mandore. It had become a flat-backed instrument by the 18th century, with five double courses of strings, tuned in fourths. The original bandurrias of the Medieval period had three strings. During the Renaissance they gained a fourth string. During the Baroque period the bandurria had 10 strings (5 pairs).\n\nThe modern bandurria has 12 strings (6 pairs). The strings are tuned in unison pairs, going up in fourths from the low G#. The lowest four strings are a major-third above those of a standard guitar and the highest two strings are a fourth above a standard guitar, i.e. G, c, f, b, e and a.\n\nJuan Ruiz first mentioned the term \"mandurria\" in the 14th century in his \"\"Libro De Buen Amor.\"\" After that, Juan Bermudo gave the description of the bandurria in his \"\"Comiença el libro llamado declaraciõ de instrumentos\"\" as a three-string instrument in 1555, but he also mentioned other types with four or even five strings. \nIn the early 1870s, a child's wake was accompanied with the bandurria music in Jijona, Alicante Province. The zapateo, a dance derived from the Spanish zapateado and introduced by tobacco cultivators from the Canary Islands, is accompanied with bandurria and other instruments before 1900.\n\nThe Philippine harp bandurria is a 14-string bandurria used in many Philippine folkloric songs, with 16 frets and a shorter neck than the 12-string bandurria. This instrument probably evolved in the Philippines during the Spanish period, from 1521 to 1898. The Filipino bandurria is used in an orchestra of plucked string instruments called rondalla. It is tuned a step lower than the Spanish version, that is, low to high: F# B E A D G.\n\nThere are also many different varieties of bandurria in South America, especially Peru and Bolivia. They have four courses, unlike the traditional Spanish six courses. The four courses are double, triple or quadruple, and the tuning is guitar-like, rather than the fourths tuning used on the Spanish type. In Lima, Peru, harp and bandurria duos were common in the early 20th century. Nowadays people there still play bandurria accompanying with the popular vals peruano, or vals criollo.\n\nAlthough generally little known in the UK, the bandurria was used by Roy Williamson of the Scottish folk-group The Corrie Folk Trio. When this group later (after the loss of one member) became the Corries, Williamson incorporated a bandurria into one of the two multi-instrument \"combolins\" that he constructed for himself and his partner.\n\n\n"}

Exercise and allergies can bring on the symptoms in an otherwise asymptomatic individual.\n\nWith emphysema the shortness of breath due to effective bronchoconstriction from excessive very thick mucus blockage (it is so thick that great difficulty is encountered in expelling it resulting in near exhaustion at times) can bring on panic attacks unless the individual expects this and has effectively learned pursed lip breathing to more quickly transfer oxygen to the blood via the damaged alveoli resulting from the disease. The most common cause of emphysema is smoking and smoking cessation is mandatory if this incurable disease is to be treated. Prevention of bronchoconstriction by this pathway is vital for emphysema sufferers and there are several anticholinergic medications that can greatly improve the quality of life for these individuals. In combination with mucous thinning agents such as Guaifenesin significant improvement in breathing can be accomplished.\n\nMore generally termed \"exercise-induced asthma\", the preferred and more accurate term \"exercise-induced bronchoconstriction\" better reflects underlying pathophysiology. It is also preferred due to the former term giving the false impression that asthma is caused by exercise.\n\nIn a patient with EIB, exercise initially follows the normal patterns of bronchodilation. However, by three minutes, the constriction sets in, which peaks at around 10–15 minutes, and usually resolves itself by an hour. During an episode of this type of bronchoconstriction, the levels of inflammatory mediators, particularly leukotrienes, histamine, and interleukin, increase. TH2-type lymphocytes are activated, with an increase in T cells expressing CD25 (IL-2R), and B cells expressing CD 23, causing increased production of IgE. After exercise, the conditions will fade within one to three minutes. In most sufferers of EIB, this is followed by a \"refractory period\", of generally less than four hours, during which if exercise is repeated, the bronchoconstriction is less emphasised. This is probably caused by the release of prostaglandins.\n\nThe underlying cause of this type of bronchoconstriction appear to be the large volume of cool, dry air inhaled during strenuous exercise. The condition appears to improve when the air inhaled is more fully humidified and closer to body temperature.\n\nThis specific condition, in the general population, can vary between 7 and 20 percent. This increases to around 80 percent in those with symptomatic asthma. In many cases, however, the constriction, even during or after strenuous exercise, is not clinically significant except in cases of severe to moderate emphysema.\n\nIn May 2013, the American Thoracic Society issued the first treatment guidelines for EIB.\n\nWhile a different cause, this has very similar symptoms, namely the immunological reaction involving release of inflammatory mediators.\n\nInhalation of allergens in sensitized subjects develops into bronchoconstriction within 10 minutes, reaches a maximum within 30 minutes, and usually resolves itself within one to three hours. In some subjects, the constriction does not return to normal, and recurs after three to four hours, which may last up to a day or more. The first is named the \"early asthmatic response\", and the latter the \"late asthmatic response\".\n\nBronchioconstriction can occur as a result of anaphylaxis, even when the allergen is not inhaled.\nBronchoconstriction is defined as the narrowing of the airways in the lungs (bronchi and bronchioles). Air flow in air passages can get restricted in three ways:\n\nThe bronchial spasm is due to the activation of parasympathetic nervous system. Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers will release acetylcholine causing the constriction of the smooth muscle layer surrounding the bronchi. These smooth muscle cells have muscarinic M receptors on their membrane. The activation of these receptors by acetylcholine will activate an intracellular G protein, that in turn will activate the phospholipase C pathway, that will end in an increase of intracellular calcium concentrations and therefore contraction of the smooth muscle cell. The muscle contraction will cause the diameter of the bronchus to decrease, therefore increasing its resistance to airflow.\n\nBronchoconstriction is common in people with respiratory problems, such as asthma, COPD, and cystic fibrosis.\n\nMedical management of transient bronchoconstriction or chronic bronchitis depends on the severity and etiology of the underlying disease and can be treated with combinations of the following medications:\n\n\n"}

On July 31, 2012, Brookhaven was approved in a referendum to become DeKalb County's 11th city. Incorporation officially took place on December 17, 2012, on which date municipal operations commenced. With a population of around 55,554 it is the largest city in DeKalb County. The new city stretches over .\n\nBrookhaven's first permanent European settler was John Evins, who started a plantation around 1810. Harris and Solomon Goodwin, who moved to Georgia from South Carolina, became owners of the land in the 1830s. The Goodwin home and the family graveyard have been preserved at the 3900 block of Peachtree Road, near Dresden Drive. A train station known as Goodwin's was constructed along the Atlanta and Richmond (later Atlanta and Charlotte) railway in 1873.\n\nThe settlement of Cross Keys, with a population of 250 in 1876, was located one mile (2 km) north along the rail line from Goodwin's. In 1879 Cross Keys was described:Nancy's Creek furnished power for operating a mill. The place has two churches—Methodist and Baptist—one common school, and steam cotton gins. Cotton and wood form the chief exports. About 140 bales of cotton shipped per annum, most of which is carried to Atlanta by wagon. Population within a radius of 2 miles [3 km], near 400. Mail daily… Depot and station [is] one and one-quarter miles [2.0 km] distant [from] this place.\n\nAtlanta residents began constructing summer cottages in the community around 1900. In 1910, on the north side of Peachtree Road were purchased for development as a planned community surrounding a golf course. The nine-hole golf course, designed by Herbert Barker, a golf pro from Garden City, Long Island, opened in 1912. Residences developed in three phases, with Brookhaven Estates designed in 1910, followed by Country Club Estates in 1929 and the Carleton Operating Company in 1936. Independently, Edwin P. Ansley sold lots in the area, calling it Oglethorpe Park. Construction of the historic neighborhood was largely complete by the end of World War II. The country club became part of the downtown Capital City Club in 1911, and its name was changed to the Capital City Country Club. The golf course was expanded from nine to eighteen holes in 1915. The clubhouse, designed by Preston Stevens in the French Provincial style, was completed in 1928.\n\nThe area was incorporated as the city of North Atlanta in 1924. In 1963, the North Atlanta's leaders asked the state legislature to allow a referendum on a new city charter. The legislature agreed, but also included an additional option in the referendum: disincorporation. The majority of voters chose disincorporation, and the city's charter was dissolved in 1965.\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, major commercial and residential development took place in Brookhaven, resulting in the area being largely built-out by 1980. The Brookhaven/Oglethorpe MARTA Station opened in 1984. In 1986, the Capital City Club and its surrounding estate homes were placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the neighborhood is now officially known as \"Historic Brookhaven.\"\n\nThe idea of incorporating Brookhaven as a city was first brought up in 2007, with the purpose of securing local community control over planning, zoning, land use, police, fire protection, and parks and recreation—rather than having those issues decided from Decatur. However, the idea failed to gain momentum. The proposed city would have included 53,000 people. In 2011, the incorporation of Brookhaven was revived when state Rep. Mike Jacobs announced plans to introduce legislation allowing the creation of a city of Brookhaven, over the objections of many residents of the neighborhood of Historic Brookhaven, which would not lie in the proposed city boundaries. On July 31, 2012, 55% of voters chose to incorporate the city of Brookhaven. In December of that same year J. Max Davis was elected as the city's first mayor.\n\nBrookhaven is located at (33.879722, -84.351667).

{"id": "2321080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321080", "title": "CNIB Foundation", "text": "CNIB Foundation\n\nThe CNIB Foundation () is a volunteer agency and charitable organization dedicated to assisting Canadians who are blind or living with vision loss, and to provide information about vision health for all Canadians. Founded in 1918 as the Canadian National Institute for the Blind () to assist soldiers who had been blinded in the First World War, CNIB originally offered sheltered care and specialized employment to people with vision loss. It has since expanded to include other programs and services, including research, public education, rehabilitation counselling and training, advocacy and an alternative-format library for people living with a print disability. It is a member of the Braille Authority of North America.\n\nThe Canadian National Institute for the Blind was incorporated on March 30, 1918 to provide food, clothing and sheltered residences for blind veterans returning from World War I as well as the 850 people blinded by the Halifax Explosion in 1917, the largest mass blinding in Canadian history. It began with 27 employees serving 1,521 people who were blind, primarily in Toronto, with two \"home teachers\" providing rehabilitation training in other parts of Canada.\n\nDuring the 1920s, CNIB operated a job placement program with limited success, also creating jobs through its own factories, broom shops and concession stands. The organization also appointed a special nurse responsible for vision health and sight preservation.\n\nIn 1923, a Dominion Charter was obtained to establish a Home Nursery Hospital and Kindergarten for the Blind under 6 years of age in Ottawa.\nMothers of blind babies from any Province in the Dominion, were encouraged to place their charges in the Canadian Blind Babies Home Association for proper care and education c. 1918 - 1939. It was to be similar to \"Sunshine Home,\" at Chorley Wood, England, which was then \"the only home in the Empire for Blind babies.\" After the founder, Mrs. Margaret Dean, died it went out of existence and the subscription funds were reallocated to the CNIB.\n\nBy the 1950s, CNIB was serving more than 17,000 clients, with offices, vocational centres and residences in major Canadian cities. A formalized research program into prevention was also prioritized. Steps were taken towards advocacy with the 1930 Blind Voters Act, allowing a person who is blind to vote with the assistance of a sighted person, and legislation around mandatory eye drops to prevent disease in newborns. In 1956, the organization helped sponsor a course for blind computer programmers.\n\nIn 2010, the organisation officially changed its name to simply \"CNIB\" after a national consultation with its membership, branding support from Pilot PMR and creative by Cossette, Inc. In 2018 the organisation rebranded again as the CNIB Foundation.\n\nCNIB operates community-based services for Canadians who are blind or partially sighted. This includes assistance in returning to school, advice on travelling, and emotional support. These services are delivered either at a local CNIB office, within the community, over the phone, online, or in an individual's home. It also offers advocacy support for resources focusing on social issues, such as concessions, housing, finances, and leisure pursuits. Self-help groups are facilitated by staff and volunteers who may be blind or partially sighted.\n\nCNIB provides functional assessments of visual abilities, instruction on how to maximize residual vision, and, as required, information and training in the use of low vision devices. Life-skills training emphasizes managing the essentials of daily living, including safe and effective methods of cooking, alternate communication methods such as braille and large print, and household tasks such as laundry, banking, writing, and personal care. Orientation and mobility instructors provide instruction on how to move safely around the house, and/or skills to travel safely within the community.\n\nThe organization operates a library that includes more than 80,000 accessible materials in formats such as Braille, audio, DAISY, and e-text. Assistive technology services include accessible audio book players, video magnifiers, computer screen readers, and other tools to make life with vision loss easier. Specialists provide instruction through demonstration, assessment, training, and technical support about the availability, selection, use, and purchase of devices for individual needs.\n\nCNIB employs approximately 1,100 professionals, working in the fields of life-skills training, library services, research, advocacy, public education, accessible design consulting, fundraising and administration. CNIB also receives support from over 10,000 volunteers working in all regions of the country.\n\nThe organization consists of a national office at the CNIB Centre in Toronto and eight provincial and territorial divisions. They are governed by a volunteer board of directors, selected from across Canada, including representatives from the corporate, medical and government sectors, as well as individuals affected by vision loss. There are eight operating divisions, plus the Lake Joseph Centre and the CNIB Library, each with a volunteer board. The chair of each division board sits on a Council of Chairs in order to provide input and advice to CNIB's President and CEO.\n\nA number of businesses and government services offer discounted rates for those who are blind or visually impaired upon presentation of a CNIB identification card. The card is offered exclusively to Canadians who are legally blind and registered at CNIB, with 20/200 vision in the best eye with correction or a visual field of 20 degrees or less.\n\nThe One Person, One Fare Policy has been in effect since January 10, 2009 and pertains only to domestic flights on Air Canada and WestJet. This policy provides an extra seat to people meeting certain requirements who need a personal attendant on their flight. Attendants are charged the taxes and fees applicable to their flight. A CNIB card does not automatically qualify you with these airlines as each airline has their own process to provide accommodations.\n\nVia Rail offers free travel to one escort accompanying a person with vision loss. The escort or attendant travels free in the same class of service. Passengers wishing to travel with an escort must be eligible for a CNIB ID Card and have the card in hand when purchasing a train ticket.\n\nGreyhound offers two-for-one fares, wherein a guide can travel free when accompanying a blind or visually impaired person. The discount also applies to travel with Société de transport de la Rive-Sud (STRSM), Corporation métropolitaine des transports de Sherbrooke (CMTS), RÉgie de transport en commum de Shawinigan (RTCS), Corporation inter-municipale de transport des Forges (CITF) and Société de transport du Saguenay (STS) People with vision loss should contact the bus carrier about discounted fares as it varies from province to province.\n\nDiscounts are available on the cost of admission for select cultural events upon presentation of a CNIB ID card. Most major movie theatres take part in a program run by Easter Seals in Canada called \"Access2Entertainment\". The program requires CNIB members to pay an administration fee of $20, which goes to Easter Seals, in order to receive a card good for 5 years. Regardless of their participation in the program, some theaters will still accept the CNIB ID card.\n\n"}

It was written by English songwriter Rod Temperton and produced by Quincy Jones, and released as the album's third single on February 2, 1980, by Epic Records. The song was first offered to Karen Carpenter, while she was working on her first solo album, but she turned it down. Lyrically, the song is about getting over troubles. It was well received by music critics, and became Jackson's third top 10 single from \"Off the Wall\", which eventually spawned four top 10 singles; Jackson was the first person to accomplish this. It was performed by Jackson in five of his concert tours.\n\nAllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine highlighted the song on its studio album. Robert Christgau wrote acclaim: \"the title tune suggests that maybe what makes Stevie Wonder (who contributes a good ballad) such an oddball isn't his genius or even his blindness so much as the fact that since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\"\n\nThe song became Jackson's third top 10 single from \"Off the Wall\". It peaked at number ten on the Pop Singles Chart and at number five on the \"Billboard\" Soul Singles Chart.\n\nJackson performed the song on The Jacksons' Destiny Tour's (1979) second leg, as well as the Triumph Tour (1981) and the Victory Tour (1984). He performed the song only on the first leg of his Bad Tour (1987), his first solo tour. During the HIStory World Tour (1996), the song was included on the \"Off the Wall\" medley (also featuring the songs \"Rock With You\" and \"Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough\") on some concert playlists. A live performance of the song can be seen in One Night in Japan, a bootleg live album and DVD release of Jackson's 1987 concert in Yokohama, Japan, during the Bad tour.\n\nMariah Carey sampled \"Off the Wall\" on her song \"I'm That Chick\", which is included in her 2008 album \"E=MC²\".\n\nVaporwave producer Saint Pepsi sampled \"Off The Wall\" in the song \"Enjoy Yourself,\" a line featured in the original song's chorus. The music video featured scenes from a McDonald's commercial with the character Mac Tonight.\n\n\nUS and Japanese singles feature the remix running 3:47, while the UK and the rest of the world got the other remix running 4:01.\n\n"}

{"id": "2321112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321112", "title": "Descamisado", "text": "Descamisado\n\nDescamisado () is a Spanish word that literally means \"without shirt\" or \"shirtless\". \n\nThe term was originally used by the narrator in Victor Hugo's seminal 1862 novel \"Les Misérables\" to refer to the revolutionary Spanish masses. Following the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo, the French (Bourbon) monarchy was restored to power. The Bourbons acted to prop up the Spanish monarchy against the popular forces of the Spanish social revolution in the Spanish War of 1823. Hugo's character is commenting on the use of the term by the supporters of the French Bourbons. The word was used pejoratively and in direct comparison to the derogative term applied to the French popular masses, the \"sans-culottes\" of the French bourgeoisie revolution of 1789.\n\nIn the 20th century, it was also used as an insult by the elite of Argentina to describe the followers of Juan Perón, who served as president of Argentina from 1946 until 1955, and then again briefly from 1973 to 1974. The term was later reclaimed as a term of pride, with Juan Perón and his wife Eva Perón affectionately referring to their followers as \"descamisados\". And during his 1945 campaign for president, Juan Perón toured the country on a train that he named \"El Descamisado\".\n\nHowever, the first usage of the term in the history of Argentina dates back to the 19th century. Tomás de Iriarte described in his memories a time when he was walking with Carlos María de Alvear and found Manuel Dorrego with dirty and broken clothes. Iriarte wrote that \"\"Excusado es decir que esto era estudiado para captarse la multitud, los descamisados\".\" (\"Needless to say, this was planned to captivate the multitude, the shirtless.\")\n\nBy most accounts, the term has its modern origins on October 17, 1945, when thousands of supporters of Juan Perón gathered in front of the Casa Rosada making a demonstration to demand Perón's release from prison. While waiting for Perón on this hot day, many men in the crowd removed their shirts—hence the term \"shirtless\". However, there is much debate among scholars in regards to the origins of the label. Some claim that the word was coined to describe the working poor, the social class from which Perón drew the greatest amount of his political backing. The \"descamisados\" of Peronism have occasionally been compared to the \"sans-culottes\" of the French Revolution. This segment of the population was able to join the ranks of the middle class thanks to mass access to healthcare and education opportunities and the process of industrialisation that took place in Argentina during the first two terms of Juan Perón's presidency (1946-1955).\n\nIn 1989, Fernando Collor de Mello in his presidential campaign used \"descamisados\" and \"pés descalços\" (\"shoeless\") to refer to the poor people.\n\n\n"}

The song's success was marked by becoming nominated in the Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group categories at the 2000 Grammy Awards, and winning a Wisconsin Area Music Industry award for Song of the Year and a Citation of Achievement from the BMI Pop Awards. The sci-fi inspired music video for \"Special\" also received nominations from music industry award panels, winning a D&AD Award, a MTV Video Music Award, and a VH1 Visionary Video award.\n\nIn 2007, \"Special\" was remastered and included on Garbage's greatest hits album \"Absolute Garbage\".\n\nGarbage began writing their second album, which would go under the working title of \"Sad Alcoholic Clowns\", in March 1997 in the band's label-head Jerry Moss's Friday Harbor, Washington, vacation house. The group demoed and made rough outlines for new songs, of which \"Special\" was one. When they felt they had made a good start, Garbage took the work they made in Washington back to their Madison, Wisconsin base at Smart Studios and begin fleshing out the ideas and rough sketches over the following year.\n\nGarbage intended their second album to build upon the framework, music style and musical template laid down by their first release; to create a rapprochement between the \"high-tech and low-down, the now sound and of golden memories\" and wear musical references to the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Garbage recorded all of their work for the second album through a 48-track digital system digitally, direct to hard drives utilizing a 24bit Pro Tools rig.\n\nGarbage employed touring bassist Daniel Shulman to perform electric bass on \"Special\", which he performed using a Fender Precision Bass run through an Ampeg SVT and then treated with \"severe\" equalization to achieve a Paul McCartney-esque Höfner sound to the part. The guitar solo intro (which returns at the end of both choruses) was performed on a 12-string Rickenbacker guitar. At the end of the first chorus, Garbage recorded a multi-tracked harmony vocal from Manson (\"I can't think of any latter-day bands where a female is singing those sort of stacked '60's style vocals\").\n\nAfter the initial riff, at the beginning of each verse line, the pronounced word \"I\" was sung as a sample from The Beatles' \"All I've Got to Do\" song.\n\nWhile experimenting with various phrasing over the outro to \"Special\", group vocalist Shirley Manson ad-libbed \"We were the talk of the town\" from the refrain of The Pretenders song \"Talk of The Town\". The band were keen to keep the lyric, and to circumvent any potential legal problems, Manson contacted Chrissie Hynde by telephone to ask for permission to use the lyric. Hynde agreed to let Garbage use the lyric without even hearing \"Special\" first (and did not ask for any credit or royalties); Manson felt that she should send Hynde a copy of the song just to be sure, but before she could do so, Hynde sent a fax to Smart Studios giving her written consent. Manson was reluctant to let people think that \"Special\" was simply a paean to Hynde; her lyrics concerned a friendship Manson had moved on from after her friend had let her down. Manson: \"Ultimately it's about those feelings of betrayal you have for people when you set your sights too high and expect too much and how that can lead to disappointment in the end.\"\n\nGarbage completed recording, producing and mixing of their second album in mid-February 1998, and the album was given the title \"Version 2.0\". \"Special\" was track listed as the album's fifth song. \"Version 2.0\" was released worldwide on May 11 of that year; despite a slow start, \"Version 2.0\" went on to equal its predecessor, selling over four million copies and achieving platinum-certification in many territories, including United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe and Australia.\n\nGarbage debuted \"Special\" live on May 15, 1998 at a concert at Ryan's Ballroom in Combined Locks, Wisconsin, which was the first date of the \"Version 2.0 tour\".\n\nIn advance of the UK release, Garbage promoted \"Special\" at the beginning of September with a live performance of the song on \"TFI Friday\", a pre-record of both \"Special\" and \"When I Grow Up\" for \"Pepsi Chart Show\", and also performed a three-song set of \"Special\", \"You Look So Fine\" and \"I Think I'm Paranoid\" for broadcast on MTV Europe. Promotional discs and 12\" remix packs were distributed across Europe from September 21 to clubs and DJs, which enabled the featured Brothers in Rhythm remixes to reach #6 on the pre-release industry Buzz Chart. \"Special\" was A-listed at Radio One and XFM and B-listed at Virgin, and also made the playlists of 52 regional radio stations.\n\n\"Special\" was released by Mushroom Records UK in the UK on October 5 on three formats. The cassette single and first CD single contains B-side \"13 × Forever\"; the CD also included a Brothers in Rhythm remix. The second CD single included a newly recorded acoustic version of \"Version 2.0\" album track \"Medication\" and a club remix of \"Push It\" by New York City club DJ Victor Calderone. On October 12, \"Special\" charted at #15 in the UK Singles Chart. A week after the initial single release, Mushroom issued \"Special\" in a collectable 3\" CD single format in blister pack packaging, featuring both B-sides and the Brothers in Rhythm remix of \"Special\". The 3-inch CD format was deleted after one week on sale. The same week, \"Version 2.0\" was certified platinum by the BPI for shipping over 300,000 units in the United Kingdom. \"Top Of The Pops\" broadcast the band's earlier pre-record of \"Special\" to mark its chart position.\n\nAcross in Europe, BMG issued \"Special\" on CD maxi and CD single formats in various territories from October 5. Festival Mushroom, having absorbed and folded White Records as part of a recent merger of Festival Records and Mushroom Records, released \"Special\" on a single CD maxi format collecting together the five tracks from the commercial UK release on October 26. \"Special\" peaked at #54 on the Australian ARIA charts, and spent six weeks in the top 100.\n\nUnlike Garbage's previous single, \"I Think I'm Paranoid\", the release of \"Special\" throughout Europe occurred when Garbage were not performing locally, the band having launched the three-month-long North American fall leg of their Version 2.0 tour in Denver, Colorado on September 15. As the tour progressed, \"Special\" was added to Modern Rock radio stations across North America on October 12, while remixes produced by Rickidy Raw were serviced to Urban radio. \"Special\" debuted on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart at #40 on October 31. Garbage performed \"Special\" on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" on October 29, and the following day promoted the single on \"The Howard Stern Show\", (but performed their 1997 Modern Rock #1 hit #1 Crush instead of \"Special\"). As the tour reached Canada, Garbage performed an extended set of tracks, including \"Special\" for a \"MusiquePlus\" televised performance filmed in Montreal on November 14, before returning to the US to wrap up the run of headline dates on November 28 in Green Bay. The following day, Garbage immediately set out to promote \"Version 2.0\" and \"Special\" on a month-long radio show circuit starting at Madison's WMAD for \"Modern Rock Live\" and on for a further twelve US radio shows; Garbage also performed \"Special\" live on \"The Tonight Show\" on December 11. December 20 marked the final radio show in Detroit. Imports of \"Special\" from Europe make enough dance club playlists by the end of 1998 that the song was certified the #3 \"Hot Dance Breakout\" by \"Billboard\" on December 25: \"Special\" made a debut on the January 6, 1999 Hot Dance Club Play chart at #44.\n\nOn January 4, 1999, \"Special\" was serviced to Top 40 radio stations in a new alternate mix for airplay. This second push of \"Special\" dovetailed with the announcement of nominations for the 41st Grammy Awards on January 6; \"Version 2.0\" was nominated for both Album of the Year and Best Rock Album. On January 26, \"Special\" was declared \"#1 Most Added\" track at Top 40 radio with 53 adds, beating out Whitney Houston's \"It's Not Right but It's Okay\". \"Special\" peaked on Modern Rock at #11 on January 30 (in its 14th week on the chart).\n\nGarbage returned from a sold-out European arena tour (where during a gap in dates they performed both \"Special\" and \"The Trick Is to Keep Breathing\" acoustically on French TV show \"Nulle Part Ailleurs\") to spend two months supporting Alanis Morissette on her North American \"Junkie\" arena tour from February 16 in Cincinnati, Ohio. On February 20, \"Special\" registered on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart at #13, and, as mainstream airplay for the single increased, climbs to #1 in that chart over the next five weeks.\n\nOn March 6, \"Special\" peaked at #10 on its ninth week on the Hot Dance Club Play chart) and also debuted at #35 on the Hot Adult Top 40 chart. The following week, \"Special\" debuted at #40 on the Top 40 Mainstream chart. On March 20, during a break in the \"Junkie\" tour, Garbage performed both \"Special\" and \"When I Grow Up\" as that week's musical guests on entertainment show \"Saturday Night Live\". March 27 saw \"Special\" debut on both the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart (at #88) and the Hot 100 Airplay chart (at #71). Garbage continued to promote the single on talk shows \"Charlie Rose\" and \"The Late Late Show\", and return to \"The Tonight Show\" to perform \"Special\" for a second time on April 2. The \"Junkie\" tour ended on April 7 in Los Angeles; the following week \"Special\" made its final appearance on one chart (Hot Dance Club Play, at #43, its fourteenth week) and its first on another (Top 40 Tracks, at #39). \"Special\" registered its last charting on the Modern Rock rankings at #35 on April 24, having enjoyed a twenty-six-week chart run (however, a week later, \"When I Grow Up\" debuted on the Modern Rock chart).\n\n\"Special\" continued to ride high in the mainstream charts throughout May 1999; peaking at #16 on the May 8 Hot Adult Top 40 (in its tenth week on that chart); and peaking for three weeks from the same date at #18 on the Top 40 Mainstream chart. \"Special\" peaked at #22 on Top 40 Tracks chart seven days later. The week of May 22 saw \"Special\" reach its highest position on both the Hot 100 (at #52, in its ninth week of thirteen) and on the Hot 100 Airplay (at #42, and in its eighth of ten). \"Special\" ended its chart runs on both the Hot 100 Airplay and Top 40 Tracks on June 5; on both the Hot 100 and Top 40 Mainstream on June 19; and after twenty-two weeks on Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks on July 31.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe promotional video for \"Special\" was filmed over a four-day shoot in London] by director Dawn Shadforth for Black Dog/RSA Films. Shadforth came to Garbage's attention when they viewed her clip for \"Beat Goes On\" by electronica group All Seeing I. Her innovative storyboard treatment for \"Special\" highly impressed the band, as her concept was not an obvious idea for a song like \"Special\".\n\nIn her concept for \"Special\", Shadforth featured the members of Garbage in a dogfight in the skies of an alien world. Before production of the video commenced, Shadforth fashioned four study models of the fighter planes to enable her to plan in advance the shots and edits she needed to tell the storyline. The planes were designed by graphic artists who had worked on visual effects for \"Lost In Space\" and \".\" Each band member was given a personalized plane design, emblazoned with imagery inspired by manga and sci-fi art; while each filmed their parts in a cabin set built upon a gimbal to give realism to the shots. Stylist William Baker, who worked on the video, said \"Dawn wanted to present Shirley Manson as a space-age fighter pilot, with shots showing her sexily manipulating the controls of her craft.\" (Shadforth later used techniques she used on the \"Special\" video in her 2001 music video for Kylie Minogue's \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\".) The video ends with the phrase, highly ominous in context of its story line, \"to be continued...\" However, Shadforth, as of early July 2016, had formed no known plans for any follow-up videos.\n\nThe \"Special\" music video began airing across Europe in mid-September 1998 and premiered on North American music stations on December 6, 1998. A remastered version of the full-length video was included on Garbage's 2007 greatest hits DVD \"Absolute Garbage\", and the original shorter edit made available as a digital download via online music services later the same year. The full length video was made available to North American online music stores in 2010.\n\nFor the initial release of \"Special\", Brothers in Rhythm's remix was included. Several early press releases for the single also included a remix by Nellee Hooper, but this version remains unreleased. Rickidy Raw's remixes were commissioned to service to North American urban radio stations, and his \"R + B remix\" saw a commercial release in the UK on formats of \"When I Grow Up\" and in Europe on \"The Trick Is to Keep Breathing\"\n\nIn 2007, Brothers in Rhythm's remix was remastered and included on the \"Absolute Garbage\" bonus disc \"Garbage Mixes\".\n\n\"Special\" end-of-year poll results:\n\n1998 Polls\n\n1999 Polls\n\n \nAlbum Version\n\nPop mix\n\n\nBrothers In Rhythm remixes\n\n\nRickidy Raw remixes\n\n A Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles lists the top twenty-five singles which had not, at the time of publishing, charted on the Hot 100 chart. \"Special\" technically topped this chart.\n\n"}

{"id": "2321130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321130", "title": "The Afters", "text": "The Afters\n\nThe Afters are an American Christian pop rock band founded by Joshua Havens and Matt Fuqua. Havens and Fuqua first worked together in a Starbucks coffee shop in Mesquite, Texas, where they played for customers, before deciding to form a band. They were initially joined by Brad Wigg from the same Starbucks, and drummer Michael Burden and performed under the name Blisse. When Burden left the band Marc Dodd, from the Mesquite Starbucks, stepped in. Their song \"Never Going Back to OK\" was the most-played song on R&R magazine's Christian CHR chart for 2008.\n\nAs a precursor to Blisse, Josh performed several shows around Dallas with his band The Screaming Mimes that included Charlton Parker, who later formed dEAf PEdESTRIANS, and Hans Grumbein. While Brad was a founding member of Blisse, he took time away from the band to perform with his own blues project, playing lead guitar. Shows at the Door in Deep Ellum were filled in by Dallas bassist Eric Kitchens and bassist/filmmaker Niko Red Star.\n\nUnder the name Blisse, the band recorded a six-song EP in 2000. From this they made enough money to cut their first album, \"When the World Is Wonderful\", which was released independently in 2001. This album contains songs also released on their major label debut album \"I Wish We All Could Win\". In 2002 they released a live concert DVD filmed at a local Dallas club called The Door.\n\nThe band changed its name after discovering that another \"Blisse\" already existed. Settling on \"The Afters\", they continued to play local clubs in the Dallas area. They were eventually discovered by INO Records and signed to a four-record deal. After this, word of the band got to Epic Records, who signed the band to a deal for mainstream promotion and distribution. Their first major label album, \"I Wish We All Could Win\", was released on February 22, 2005. The first single from the album was \"Beautiful Love\", written by Josh Havens about a time when his wife was abroad doing humanitarian aid. The single's music video led The Afters to a 2005 MTVu \"Streaming Woodie\" award. In addition, \"Beautiful Love\" became the theme song for the MTV show, \"8th and Ocean\" about the life of female and male fashion models living in Miami, Florida. The song was also featured in the 2006 film, \"Just My Luck\". The song \"Until the World\" was the theme song for the American drama television series that aired on the ABC Family Network \"Beautiful People\".\n\nIn an update posted on their official website, the band went into the studio in August 2006 to start recording their second album, \"Never Going Back to OK\". It was originally scheduled to be released on December 26, 2007, as per a post on their MySpace blog, but was ultimately delayed and released on February 26, 2008.\n\nThe first single from the album, the title track \"Never Going Back to OK\" premiered on October 16, 2007, on Total Axxess. It was also released as a streaming file on The Afters' MySpace page on November 10, 2007. The song hit the R&R magazine charts in December 2007. It reached No. 1 on the R&R CHR chart in March 2008 and R&R magazine ranked it as the most played song on U.S. Christian CHR radio in 2008.\n\nIn spring of 2008, the band began their own headlining tour along with Falling Up, Ruth, and Everyday Sunday.\nThe Afters stated in their Twitter account that they started recording their next album on October 27, 2009. The album, called \"Light Up the Sky\", was released on September 14, 2010. The album's first single, the title track, has reached No. 1 on Billboard's Christian CHR radio, and also received an appearance on MTV's \"The Hills\".\n\nIn January 2011 The Afters joined the Rock And Worship Roadshow national tour headlined by MercyMe. Light Up the Sky was produced by Dan Muckala.\n\nThe Afters announced a new album to be released on April 17, 2012. A month later, they released a new single entitled \"Life is Beautiful\" on iTunes, in which the song was part of the soundtrack for the movie \"October Baby\". On February 19, 2013, a new single, \"Every Good Thing\", became available on iTunes. The new album's title was \"Life is Beautiful\".\n\nOn August 28, 2015, the band released \"Live on Forever\", the lead single from \"Live on Forever\", their fifth studio album set for release in late 2016 on Fair Trade Records.\n\nIn 2018, The Afters' new single, \"The Beginning and Everything After\" appeared on the \"Billboard\" 100. It was followed by \"Fear No More\" in November.\n\nCurrent members\n\nFormer members\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2321132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321132", "title": "The Girl Is Mine", "text": "The Girl Is Mine\n\n\"The Girl Is Mine\" is a song recorded by American singer Michael Jackson and English musician Paul McCartney. The track was written by Jackson and produced by Jackson and Quincy Jones. It was released as the first single for Jackson's sixth solo album, \"Thriller\" (1982). The song was recorded at Westlake Studios, Los Angeles, from April 14 to 16, 1982. The year before, Jackson and McCartney had recorded \"Say Say Say\" and \"The Man\" for the latter's fifth solo album, \"Pipes of Peace\" (1983). Although \"The Girl Is Mine\" was released as a single, Jackson never performed the song live.\n\n\"The Girl Is Mine\" achieved success in the music charts. Aside from topping the R&B singles chart, the single peaked at number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number eight in the UK. By 1985, it had sold 1.3 million copies, and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of at least one million units. Despite the song's success, it received generally mixed reviews from critics who consider it to be the weakest song on \"Thriller\".\n\n\"The Girl Is Mine\" has been the subject of two plagiarism lawsuits, the first in 1984 and the latter in 1993. Both instances required Jackson to testify in court, and each lawsuit was decided in favor of the singer and his record label.\n\nIn 2008, for the 25th anniversary edition of \"Thriller\", Black Eyed Peas singer will.i.am remixed \"The Girl Is Mine\". The remix received generally unfavorable reviews from music critics.\n\nThe writing of \"The Girl Is Mine\" was completed by Jackson as he watched cartoons with Paul McCartney. Producer Quincy Jones had initially told Jackson to write a song about two men fighting over a girl. Inspired, Jackson awoke during the night and sang the song into a tape recorder. He later said, \"I sang exactly what I heard in my head, starting with the melody and the keyboard and the strings and everything. So, I just orally put it all on tape.\" Jones also asked Jackson to add a rap verse. The song was then recorded by Jackson and McCartney at Westlake Studios, Los Angeles, from April 14 to 16, 1982. The year before, the duo had recorded \"Say Say Say\" and \"The Man\" for McCartney's fifth solo album, \"Pipes of Peace\" (1983).\n\nJackson said that the recording of \"The Girl Is Mine\" was one of his most enjoyable moments in the studio. He explained, \"One of my favorite songs to record, of all my recordings as a solo artist, is probably \"The Girl Is Mine\", because working with Paul McCartney was pretty exciting and we just literally had fun. It was like lots of kibitzing and playing, and throwing stuff at each other, and making jokes. We actually recorded the (instrumental) track and the vocals pretty much live at the same time, and we do have footage of it, but it's never been shown.\" He concluded, \"Maybe one day we'll give you a sneak preview of it.\" The footage of the pair was later shown at The Paul McCartney World Tour.\n\nMany members of the band Toto participated in the recording of this song, including David Paich (piano), Jeff Porcaro (drums), Steve Lukather (guitars) and Steve Porcaro (synthesizer programming).\n\nThe musical structuring of \"The Girl Is Mine\" uses the AABA form, in which the song's title serves as the main source of needed repetition. When used to the maximum, this structuring, also known as the thirty-two-bar form, has the title repeat itself in the same place, in at least two of the three A verses. Author Sheila Davis' book, \"The Craft of Lyric Writing\", notes that \"the repeated title line simultaneously outlines the framework of the design and drives home the main point of the lyric\". Jackson's \"She's Out of My Life\" also uses this musical structuring, as does \"Body and Soul\", \"Oh, Lady Be Good!\" and \"Try a Little Tenderness\". The musical chords in \"The Girl Is Mine\" are seen in several songs written by Jackson. \"Blues Away\", from \"The Jacksons\", and other songs (\"Why Can't I Be\" and \"Thank You for Life\") used the chords before \"The Girl Is Mine\".\n\nDespite recording \"Say Say Say\" and \"The Man\" a year prior, \"The Girl Is Mine\" was the first song to gain a release from the duo and the first single from the \"Thriller\" album. \"The Girl Is Mine\" was released as a single on October 18, 1982. The single's cover photograph was taken by McCartney's wife, Linda. Listeners were not impressed by \"The Girl Is Mine\", and thought that Jackson's \"Thriller\" would also be a disappointment. The public felt that Jackson and the producer, Quincy Jones, had created a song for the white pop audience. Despite some of the public's concerns, \"The Girl Is Mine\" achieved success in the music charts. Topping the R&B singles chart, the single peaked at number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 (behind \"Maneater\" by Hall & Oates and \"Down Under\" by Men at Work) and the Norwegian Singles Chart. \"The Girl Is Mine\" reached number one on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. The song charted at number eight in the UK, peaking within the New Zealand Top 20. By 1985, the single had sold 1.3 million copies. The single was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of at least one million units.\n\nSince its release, \"The Girl Is Mine\" has received mixed reviews from journalists and music critics. Journalist Robert Christgau described the pairing of McCartney and Jackson as \"Michael's worst idea since 'Ben'\". \"Rolling Stone\" stated that the song was a \"wimpoid MOR [middle of the road] ballad\" and that McCartney was \"tame\". Stephen Erlewine of AllMusic noted that the song had a \"sweet schmaltz\". Jackson's breakdown with the \"irrepressibly silly Paul McCartney\" was \"disarmingly goofy\", according to \"Stylus Magazine\". Salon.com later described \"The Girl Is Mine\" as a \"sappy duet\". They concluded that McCartney had become a \"wimpy old fart\". The song garnered a favourable review from Jackson's biographer, J. Randy Taraborrelli. The writer stated that the song was \"cute\" but lacked substance. He added that the track had a \"middle-of-the-road calm\" and was the antithesis of the \"rambunctious\" \"Beat It\".\n\n\n\"The Girl Is Mine\" has been the subject of two plagiarism lawsuits. Both instances required Jackson to testify in court, and each lawsuit was decided in favor of the singer and his record label. The first legal trial occurred in 1984, with Fred Sanford claiming that Jackson had cut a tape of his song, \"Please Love Me Now\". Jackson, however, insisted that he composed \"The Girl Is Mine\". The $5 million copyright suit was closed after the jury of five men and a woman reached a verdict in favor of Jackson. Their verdict was reached after a three-day deliberation. Jackson was not a defendant in the trial but testified to maintain his credibility. James Klenk, Jackson's attorney, praised the singer upon the jury's verdict. \"The man is a genius. He doesn't need anyone else's songs. His own words were the key.\" During the court proceedings, Jackson revealed how he composes his songs. \"I put them in a tape recorder and I orally sing them into the tape, and that's how it happens.\" One juror stated, \"His presentation indicated that he was well able to develop his own songs.\"\n\nThe song's second plagiarism trial was in 1993. Reynaud Jones and Robert Smith alleged that \"The Girl Is Mine\", along with \"Thriller\"—written by Rod Temperton—and \"We Are the World\", resembled their musical works. The pair added that they had been childhood neighbors of the Jackson family when they had resided in Gary, Indiana. Jackson, Lionel Richie—co-writer of \"We Are the World\"—and Quincy Jones were named as the defendants. The plaintiffs asserted that Joseph Jackson had received a demo tape from them. From the tapes, the defendants were alleged to have stolen the three hit songs. Reynaud Jones also claimed that he had considered suing Jackson over \"Billie Jean\". Jackson appeared in court via a taped testimony. Following the testimony, the nine-member jury found Jackson to be the writer and composer of \"The Girl Is Mine\" in early 1994. They also ruled that the defendants had not plagiarized \"Thriller\" or \"We Are the World\".\n\nFor \"Thriller 25\", an album celebrating \"Thriller\"'s 25th anniversary, Black Eyed Peas singer will.i.am remixed \"The Girl Is Mine\". Entitled \"The Girl Is Mine 2008\", the remix features an original solo demo of the song by Jackson without McCartney. will.i.am added his own vocals and new verse. The song reached number 12 in New Zealand, 22 in France, in the top 50 of Denmark and Sweden, and number 51 in Switzerland.\n\nThough the remix sampled the demo, \"The Daily Telegraph\" alleged that McCartney was omitted because he and Jackson had fallen out over Jackson's purchase of Sony/ATV Music Publishing and the Beatles' song catalogue in 1985. However, the original version of \"The Girl Is Mine\" was included on \"Thriller 25\" with McCartney's vocals included.\n\n\"The Girl Is Mine 2008\" received mostly unfavorable reviews. Journalist Christopher Rees stated that will.i.am had \"done a fantastic job of murdering a classic song\". Rob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that at will.i.am's production was \"dumb-thug bluster\" and criticized him for trying to hide the \"goofy 'doggone' hook\"—\"the whole point of the song\". Music journalist Aidin Vaziri wrote that will.i.am \"completely erases Paul McCartney's vocal track from the original duet to make room for himself spouting nonsense\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic claimed that will.i.am had turned \"The Girl Is Mine\" into a \"hapless dance number\". Kelefa Sanneh of \"Blender\" wrote that \"will.i.am contributes beats (why?) and rhymes (why, oh, why?) to 'The Girl Is Mine 2008'\". IGN's Todd Gilchrist stated that will.i.am's \"The Girl Is Mine\" remix was an offense. The offense was made even more \"egregious\" by the insertion of his own \"atonal vocal presence\" in place of McCartney's.\n\nPitchfork Media added to the unfavorable reviews, stating of will.i.am, \"He takes Macca off 'The Girl Is Mine' but decides it can't work without someone sounding like an idiot and steps manfully in himself.\" \"The Times\" stated that whoever thought it was a good idea for will.i.am to participate in the song ought to be \"locked in a windowless cell with nothing but those songs on a continuous loop\". PopMatters, however, praised \"Thriller 25\" and the remix of \"The Girl Is Mine\". They wrote, \"Any album good enough to make you forgive (although maybe not forget) a song as bad as the Paul McCartney duet 'The Girl is Mine' has got to be damn good.\" They added that will.i.am had put a \"breezy spin\" on the track and that the song's omission of McCartney did not suffer because of it.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2321134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321134", "title": "Fallen (Transformers)", "text": "Fallen (Transformers)\n\nThe Fallen is a fictional robot supervillain in the Transformers robot superhero franchise. According to Hasbro, he was formerly known as Megatronus Prime, and was a multiversal singularity, meaning that while he exists across the multiverse, this is no longer the case because of an event called The Shrouding, where all multiversal singularities within the Hasbro-Takara multiversal now exist as separate beings within each universe. As explained in more detail in the appropriate sections below, The Fallen has been given different origin stories in several of the different continuities in which he has appeared. Although the Fallen's origins are only suggested in his comic book appearance, they would be fully explained in Dorling Kindersley's \"Transformers: The Ultimate Guide\".\n\nMegatronus was one of the original Thirteen Primes created by Primus and the founder of the Decepticons in many storylines. Originally, he was depicted as having betrayed his creator by siding with Primus' dark twin, Unicron. In the final battle between Primus and Unicron, Megatronus fell victim to the same fate as his master, sucked through a black hole into another dimension. However, while Unicron emerged in another universe, the Fallen was not so fortunate, finding himself trapped in the \"underspace\" between dimensions. This origin has been altered or revised several times, even to the point that Primus and Unicron are removed entirely, even so, this is because he can jump through time and space, and hop dimensions, like the other Thirteen Primes.\n\nIn the 1985 \"Challenge of the GoBots\" episode \"Search for the Ancient Gobonauts\", \"the Evil One\", is retroactively a version of Megatronus, according to \"Ask Vector Prime\". He nearly destroyed Gobotron with a device called the Dark Heart, only to wind up under the Nazca Lines on Earth. Centuries later, Cy-Kill goes on a quest to look for the ancient villain.\n\nYears before the Fallen was introduced in the \"Generation 1\" Dreamwave Productions comic book, \"\" would introduce a similar character. This character was known simply \"Megatron\". Both the \"Generation 1\" Megatron and \"Beast Era\" Megatron named themselves after this mythological figure. It is unknown if this Megatron named himself after him or if they are the same character, but all that is known about him is that he is \"the beginning and the end\" and \"the alpha and omega\", or at least claims to be as something of a God complex.\n\nThe Fallen made his first appearance in the second volume of \"\" (2003). Around 6.5 million years ago, an accident in the \"space bridge\" system on Cybertron liberated the Fallen from his prison, and he materialized on Cybertron, where he quickly recruited the Chaos Trinity - Bludgeon, Mindwipe and Bugly - into his employ. Abducting Transformers that he identified as possessing \"genetic potential\" within their sparks - Grimlock, Blitzwing, Jetfire and Hot Spot - the Fallen planned to use their energies to awaken Primus from his self-imposed slumber, thereby alerting Unicron to his location, allowing the world-eater to renew hostilities with his old enemy. An attack from combined Autobot and Decepticon forces led by Shockwave and Prowl disrupted his plans, and Primus himself reached out and promptly destroyed the Fallen.\n\nThe Fallen made an appearance in the story \"Vector Prime: In the Beginning\" published by Fun Publications. This issue shows many key points in previous Transformers stories from across the original comics, the original cartoon, \"Beast Wars\", and the \"Armada\" television series. It establishes that there is one Unicron across the multiple continuities, and that Vector Prime travels through all of Transformers history. One of the silhouettes of the first 12 Transformers that stands behind Vector Prime in his first panel appears to be that of The Fallen. The later storyline \"Another Light\" saw Megatronus in an unlikely reunion with his fellow Primes, attempting to prevent Nexus Prime from creating firmer barriers between the various multiversal streams. This effort failed, and resulted in the Thirteen, Primus, and Unicron being split into separate beings with different personalities across the various dimensions. The \"Ask Vector Prime\" Facebook page also introduced other historical elements to Megatronus' character, such as him and his fellow Primes communicating with ancient Earth using holographic avatars that inspired the gods of Greek mythology, with Megatronus inspiring Ares.\n\nNexus Prime claimed that Megatronus, in collusion with Liege Maximo, began the First Cybertronian Civil War between the Thirteen and the tribes each Prime led. He broke a promise to Solus Prime and betrayed Prima. A notable figure in the war was Megatronus' former underling, Galvatron, who succeeded in killing Nexus Prime. In the end, the war forced eleven of the Thirteen to leave Cybertron, and Megatronus chose another planet to reside on. His location was later discovered by Shockwave, who seeded the planet with one of his Regenesis ores.\n\nMegatronus was one of the Thirteen Original Primes, the first Transformers created by Primus to battle together against the chaos bringer Unicron. Thanks to his love interest Solus Prime - who created a cosmic weapon called the Requiem Blaster capable of vanquishing Unicron - Megatronus was able to depower him, forcing him to temporarily but in a long-term period of time remain in stasis. As the Thirteen rested, Solus Prime was convinced that the Requiem Blaster should be destroyed, not to fall in wrong hands. On the other hand, Megatronus believed that the Blaster should be kept in order to assist the Primes in future sieges. The brief skirmish for possession of the Blaster resulted in its accidental activation, brutally murdering Solus and transforming her corpse into the Well of All Sparks. After the other Eleven considered this an unforgivable crime and banished Megatronus for that, they locked away the Requiem Blaster and built a tomb for Solus surrounded by a deep cave.\n\nDevastated, Megatronus gathered an army of followers which he named the Decepticons, inspired by his rage after losing his beloved one. From there, Megatronus set up a plan to recover Solus from the Well by draining the Sparks of all other sentient beings in the Universe. However, he was stopped by Prima, who idealized it would not be worth it to sacrifice billions of new Sparks for an ancient one. It is unknown which path Megatronus took after the showdown. Meanwhile, billions of years later, Megatronus's legacy was inherited by Megatron, who created the Decepticons as of his own vision for the planet Cybertron.\n\nLater in the Earth-year 2018, after the Earth Wars between Autobots and Decepticons ended and Optimus Prime was resurrected and exiled with Megatron and a new High Council - Starscream, Rodimus Prime, and Mistress of Flame - took over the reborn Cybertron after Unicron's second defeat by the new Matrix-bearer Rodimus; Megatronus has sent the Prime artifact known as the Enigma of Combination to spark a flame to the Combiner Wars, followed by the Titan Wars. He has also collaborated with Overlord, who arrived in Unicron's corpse to claim the Matrix of Chaos. After the clash between Trypticon and Fortress Maximus was over, Megatronus arrived and - at the presence of the renegade Megatron, Windblade, Victorion and Perceptor - murdered Optimus Prime again and claimed the Matrix of Leadership and the Enigma as fundamental parts of his plot to revive Solus Prime in the Well with a machine of his own.\n\nAngered by Megatronus, Windblade, Megatron, Victorion and Perceptor travelled to a Swamp to claim the Requiem Blaster before him, coincidentally recruiting the Combiners Volcanicus, Predaking and the Requiem Blaster's current protector, Optimus Primal. However, Megatronus later arrived to claim back the Blaster as the team was weakened after a showdown with Overlord - who was seeking revenge against Megatron - and Rodimus Cron - a renegade Hot Rod possessed by Unicron after inheriting the Matrix of Chaos. With the Blaster, the Matrix and the Enigma in his possession, Megatronus teleported back to the Well of All Sparks to fuse the three artifacts in a machine that would use the Enigma to combine the essence of the Matrix with the power of the Blaster and drain every Cybertronian's Spark throughout the Universe, bringing the Transformers to their final days.\n\nJust as Megatronus's machine was activated, the team arrived and damaged it, causing it to briefly go offline. Angered, Megatronus incapacitated all of the members but Megatron by paralyzing them with painful flames. And just as Megatronus is ready to finish his follower off for good, Rodimus Cron arrives and is completely assumed by Unicron, becoming the new overpowered entity known as Rodimus Unicronus, willing to destroy the Matrix of Leadership and the last remnants of his brother Primus within it, as well as destroying the last surviving Original Prime. As Megatronus and Unicron engaged in the closest showdown between Primus and Unicron ever since the dawn of the Universe, Optimus Primal was able to break Megatronus's machine once and for all with the assistance of Grimlock and Windblade and then he recovered the Matrix of Leadership. Enraged again by another nuisance to his plans, Megatronus attempted to stop Primal, but before this was possible he was able to open the Matrix for himself, becoming the new Matrix-bearer Optimal Optimus.\n\nAs the fight proceeded, Megatronus was seen fighting the rest of the team as Optimal should fend-off Rodimus Unicronus. When the worst moment came, as the Requiem Blaster was aimed to the team (and more specifically Megatron), Predaking arrived and was able to briefly immobilize Megatronus, later being unfortunately murdered by him as a consequence. During this time, Megatron negotiated with the fading-away figure of a resurrected Solus Prime to stop Megatronus, and during the same time the rest of the team was able to immobilize Rodimus and take the Matrix of Chaos out of his chest. When Solus accepted the deal - for she would not accept her beloved one could take any more lives - Megatronus was lured into the Well of All Sparks, instantly draining his lifeless body inside. It is known that Megatronus will resurrect in the future due to his immortality and his mutant Spark. However, this date is not predicted and could perhaps never arrive as Megatronus may decided to stay in the Realm of All Sparks aside her beloved one and the rest of the Original Primes.\n\nAfter the death of Megatronus Prime, Megatron has now completely given up his Decepticon tyrant life as he realized his way could perhaps not be the right, pending to sacrifice himself to stop Unicron from returning once again and banishing himself and Unicron's Anti-Spark (the Matrix of Chaos) to the Realm of All Sparks by allowing Optimus Primal to fire the Requiem Blaster on him.\n\nAnd after Megatron's departure, Optimus Prime's Spark was unplugged from the Well, allowing him to return to function. The Matrix of Leadership remained in Optimal's possession, however, enabling him to lead the Maximals in a fight against the Predacons (\"Beast Wars\") in the distant future.\n\nThe character appears as the titular main antagonist of the series' second live action film, \"\", the 2009 sequel to the 2007 \"Transformers\" movie. Director Michael Bay described him as \"apocalyptic\". The Fallen has the ability to teleport and generate a shockwave upon reappearance. He is also armed with a void scepter, and has telekinesis. He stands tall with a mass of .\n\nIn \"Transformers: Defiance\", the artifact containing the Fallen is unearthed when Cybertron comes under attack by aliens that desire the AllSpark. During the fight, Megatron is gravely injured as the Fallen awakens from his rest, healing Megatron while taking him under his wing with promises of power. Under the guidance of the Fallen, Megatron reforms the Decepticons and plunges Cybertron into Civil War. In the prose story \"Transformers: Convergence\", it is revealed that Fallen freed himself from his prison after Soundwave presented him Sentinel Prime Space bridge Pillars, explaining how he got freed before the events of \"Revenge of the Fallen\" happened.\n\nThe original seven Primes scattered throughout the galaxy looking for planets on which they could build Star Harvesters. These massive machines created energon, the vital energy of Transformers, by destroying suns, and were activated by the artifact of the Primes known as the Matrix of Leadership. The Dynasty of Primes had one rule: Star Harvesters were not to be built in solar systems which contain life. Then, in 17,000 B.C., one of them, Megatronus Prime, arrived on Earth. He believed the Cybertronians were the ultimate race and destined to rule the universe, and hated the human race, and so decided to ignore the Primes' one rule by destroying Earth's sun. To assist him in his construction of a Star Harvester, the treacherous Prime, now known as The Fallen, assembled an army of like-minded Cybertronians who called themselves \"Decepticons\". Identifying themselves with a symbol based on the fearsome visage of the Fallen, the Decepticons built the Harvester in prehistoric Egypt, and slaughtered any humans who discovered the Harvester. Learning of his betrayal, the other Primes launched an assault on the Decepticon forces. Although they were unable to kill the Fallen, the Primes succeeded in capturing and imprisoning him before sealing the Matrix within a tomb made of their own bodies, thus sacrificing themselves to help save Earth and humanity.\n\nAs a result, the Fallen became the first Decepticon and the true founder and leader of the Decepticons (as Megatron accepts the Fallen as his master), and all future Decepticons would wear an insignia which is similar to the Fallen's face.\n\nIn the present day, the Fallen appears after millennia and resumes leadership of the Decepticons. As he was weakened in the fight against the other Primes, he has spent all this time stuck on his ship on a planet far from Earth, draining energy from the Cybertronian protoforms on the ship to regain his strength. The Fallen reveals to the revived Megatron that the knowledge from the AllSpark they seek so they can find the Matrix is now in Sam Witwicky. This makes Sam the key to another source of Energon, gained from the Fallen's Sun Harvester, and the Fallen commands Megatron to find Sam. He also reveals he can only be defeated by a descendant of the Primes, with the last survivor of these descendants killed by Megatron. Now confident of no threats to him, the Fallen himself travels to Earth to complete his plans to destroy humanity, demanding the humans to turn over Sam to him otherwise the Decepticons will kill them all. Because of this, Sam is branded a fugitive by the world. Later, the Fallen, along with Megatron and the Decepticons, travel to the Great Pyramids of Giza, where the Fallen's Sun Harvester lies beneath one of the pyramids. There, seconds after Optimus Prime has been resurrected by Sam, the Fallen easily knocks a weakened Optimus down, steals the Matrix of Leadership from his body and teleports to the Sun Harvester. With Optimus too weak to battle him alone, the Fallen uses the Matrix to activate the Sun Harvester, and none of the human forces are able to stop the Fallen. However, Optimus receives parts from , making him super-powerful, arrives on the scene and promptly disables the Sun Harvester beyond repair while knocking the Fallen and Megatron off of the pyramid. The Fallen and Optimus Prime then engage in a fierce duel. Megatron tries to help his master, but is quickly overpowered and blasted out of the fight in defeat by Optimus. The Fallen counterattacks Optimus, managing to knock away his sword and ripping off one of his rocket thrusters before attacking Optimus with his scepter, but Optimus viciously retaliates, breaking the weapon by using it to tear off the Fallen's face. Realizing that he is losing, the Fallen tries to get away and escape, but Optimus punches through his chest and crushes his spark core, finally killing him. Seeing his master dead, a wounded but resilient Megatron takes his position back as leader of the Decepticons, fleeing with Starscream.\n\nThe Fallen (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) appears in the official game adaptation of the film. He is not a playable character, but is the final boss of both campaigns, except in the Nintendo DS versions where the final boss is Optimus Prime or Megatron.\n\nMegatronus is one of the Thirteen Primes in \"\" and \"\". He is called \"The Fallen\" at times, but never addressed as such when he actually appears. This version of Megatronus bears a striking resemblance to \"Generation 1\" Galvatron and transforms into a tank that resembles the tank mode of Shockwave's alternate mode from \"Transformers Animated\". Though the exact origins with the Decepticons are unclear, he is called the \"first Decepticon\" and bears a Decepticon insignia, a possible nod to \"\". Plates surrounding his face can become a mask that obscures/protects his facial features, and in addition to sporting arm cannons he wields a powerful spear and possesses supernatural abilities such as telekinesis.\n\nMegatronus is mentioned as one of the original thirteen Primes in the 2010 book \"\". Megatron is shown originally calling himself Megatronus, after this particular Prime, and is a gladiator, who then takes the name Megatron after the name is shortened by cheering fans at one of his matches. Megatronus, though the namesake of the Decepticon leader Megatron in the book, holds no sway over Megatron, who took the name simply because he had none of his own and wished to be associated with power and grandeur.\n\nAccording to \"\", Megatronus commissioned Solus Prime to create the Requiem Blaster. Later, Megatronus murdered Solus, triggering the first breaking among the Thirteen and leading him to become the Fallen.\n\n\"\" reveals that Megatronus and Solus Prime were in love, but that Megatronus was prone to bursts of temper and aggression due to his pride and secret shame at being a necessary counter-force to balance out light and darkness within the Thirteen. Following the War of the Primes, he exiled himself from Cybertron after unintentionally murdering Solus Prime.\n\nIn the 2010-2013 animated series \"\", Megatron named himself after this particular Prime. He is briefly mentioned in the episode \"Partners\", when Starscream tells the Autobots he wishes to join them, Bulkhead jokes by saying that he's been \"lobbing with The Fallen\". In the episode \"One Shall Rise, Part 1\", the Thirteen were mentioned as the ones who vanquished Unicron. It is unclear, however, which of the Thirteen depicted in the flashback scene was the Fallen, due to the animation. In \"One Shall Rise, Part 3\", it was said by Ratchet that Megatron named himself after the Fallen's original name: \"Megatronus\".\n\nIn the 2015 sequel series, \"\", Megatronus, one of the original Thirteen Primes, is revealed to have been exiled to another dimension after murdering Solus Prime of which he blames both the Earth and Cybertron for. From within his prison dimension, Megatronus observed the Great War between the Autobots and the Decepticons, raging from Cybertron, across the galaxy and eventually to the battles between both groups' respective leaders, Optimus Prime and Megatron, on Earth. Impressed and honored by Megatron's respect of his name, he christened himself as the first Decepticon, in order to inspire future generations he had foreseen.\n\nIn the present day, years after the Decepticons defeat, Megatronus plans to destroy Earth and Cybertron. Though trapped in his prison dimension he can still physically influence, and communicate with beings in, the prime dimension. Thus, he causes the crash of the Autobot \"Alchemor\" ship and releasing its Decepticon criminals, eventually making contact with a pack led by Steeljaw. Megatronus propositions a slightly unwilling Steeljaw into creating a GroundBridge to release him from his prison and in exchange would ensure that Earth will become his to rule. Through Steeljaw's pack's efforts, Megatronus arrives on Earth on Crown City's Liberty Island. There he subsequently engages Optimus Prime and the other Autobots, and reveals he has been granted enhanced abilities by an unknown source. Obtaining a requested Spark-fuser from Steeljaw, Megatronus announces his intention to the Decepticons to use it to summon what remains of Unicron's anti-spark from Earth's core, and the AllSpark from Cybertron, and merge them resulting in both planets' dying.\n\nSteeljaw becomes furious and tries to attack Megatronus only to be swiftly defeated. Megatronus nearly succeeds in his plan, but Optimus cuts away the part of the scepter with the anti-spark just before the Allspark enters it and cause to the Sparks to merge, with a throw of his weapon. This causes the two Sparks to return to their respective points of origin, and a now-enraged Megatronus lashes out at the Autobots. During this showdown, the Autobots follow a plan from Bumblebee, with Optimus and Grimlock attacking him to force him into a spot where Liberty Island statue's arm, cut off by Windblade, Sideswipe and Drift, lands on him. As Megatronus tries to get out from under it, Bumblebee, Strongarm and Sideswipe use their combined Decepticon Hunters to emit a blastwave large enough to vaporize him. However, Bumblebee still questions if he is not dead.\n\nThe animated series seems to alter Megatronus' pre-established history, removing the redeeming and tragic qualities that \"Transformers: Exodus\" had established (such as his relationship and love for Solus Prime, and his self-doubt and depression at being a dark \"counter\" to Prima's light) rather modeling him more in line with his film counterpart, being a cold and brutal tyrant who harbors a hatred against Earth, his murder of Solus Prime apparently fully intentional, and thinking of himself as \"the First Decepticon\" despite having no known connection to the groups founding or his namesake. Although, this could be a result of his long imprisonment having driven him insane and embittered him into his current villainous state.\n\nMegatronus appears as an unlockable character in the mobile game for \"\".\n\nThe first toy version of the Fallen was released in 2007 as a part of the \"Transformers: Titanium\" toy line as a 6\" transforming figure. The Fallen would receive several toys for the toy line accompanying \"\", in which the toys were a new mold that transformed from robot to Cybertronian Destroyer mode, despite not having been depicted with an alternate mode in the film. Most prominently, he would receive a voyager class toy which first appeared on the internet in February 2009. This toy was designed by Takara Tomy toy designer Hisashi Yuki. With the Fallen standing 1280 centimeters (42 feet) tall, and this toy standing 20 centimeters tall in robot mode, this makes the toy about 1:64 scale.\n\nA Toys \"R\" Us exclusive gift set included the Voyager Fallen figure with a gray redeco of Voyager Megatron (2007 version) and a blue/gray redeco of Deluxe Soundwave. In 2010, he would receive a voyager class toy with a light blue/teal redeco with spear and an all-new head sculpt with a removable face to depict when he is decapicitated by Optimus. The figure is retooled with new hands and grooves on the upper torso to hold the spear. Hasbro has stated in an interview that the light blue was to balance the darker blue of the main body.\n\nMegatronus would receive a number of toys in the toy line accompanying the 2015 \"\" television series. Packaged with Optimus Prime, the first Megatronus toy is a smaller Legion-sized mold which can transform from a tank to robot and back. The second toy, 5-Step Changer Megatronus, transforms from robot to tank and back in five steps and is released in an open package, which allows children to touch the toy. His scannable Decepticon insignia is on his robot mode chest/vehicle mode front. As with all \"Robots in Disguise\" figures, he has a scannable Decepticon insignia, which scanning in the \"Robots in Disguise\" mobile game temporarily unlocks the character if the player has not permanently unlocked it already. The badge is easily scannable while in package. Also made was a \"Warrior Class\" figure of Megatronus (the renaming of the Deluxe class for \"Robots In Disguise\") that came in two variants: one exclusive to Toys R Us worldwide with his faceplate down, and a mass release version with the faceplate up. Both versions come with his spear-like scepter.\n\n"}

These identification marks were used in the eighteenth and nineteenth century in the days before municipal fire services were formed.\nThe UK marks are called 'Fire insurance plaques'. \n\nThe first to use the mark was the Sun Fire Office which was established in 1710. Some period specimens remain on historical buildings in the older areas of Britain's and America's cities and larger towns. Cast metal plaques were made of iron, lead, or sometimes brass. Embossed sheet metal signs were also made, as well as flat enamel signs – the latter mostly in Continental Europe in the later 19th century. \n\nPeriod specimens may have high value among antiques collectors, leading to illicit creation of fakes. Also, nostalgic reproductions have been made since the early 20th century for decorative purposes. \n\nFor most of the 18th century, each insurance company maintained its own fire brigade, which extinguished fires in those buildings insured by the company and, in return for a fee to be paid later, in buildings insured by other companies. By 1825, fire marks served more as advertisements than as useful identifying marks; some insurance companies no longer issued fire marks, and those that did sometimes left them up after a policy had expired. Successive combinations of fire brigades led to virtually the entire city of London being put under the protection of the London Fire Engine Establishment, which fought not only the fires of policy holders but those of nonsubscribers, the reason being that fires in uninsured buildings could rapidly spread to insured buildings. The Museum of English Rural Life has a collection of 100 fire insurance marks from around England \n\nFire Insurance has over 200 years of history in America. The early fire marks of Benjamin Franklin's time can still be seen on some Philadelphia buildings as well as in other older American cities. Subscribers paid fire fighting companies in advance for fire protection and in exchange would receive a fire mark to attach to their building. The payments for the fire marks supported the fire fighting companies. Volunteer fire departments were also common in the United States, and some fire insurers contributed money to these departments and awarded bonuses to the first fire engine arriving at the scene of a fire.\n\n Fire insurance companies began operating in the Australian colonies in the early part of the 19th century. They were both Australian and foreign, principally British, owned. The Union Assurance Company of Sydney and The Australasian Fire and Life Assurance Company are both recorded as having offices in George Street, Sydney in 1836. The Sydney Fire Insurance Company was established in 1844 at 468 George Street Sydney. It issued for display at the company’s fire insured properties a mark in copper with the company name with the image of a golden fleece, being at that time in the New South Wales colony a symbol of safety and security. A rare and original plaque from the 1840s is on display at the historic Darling House, The Rocks, the current property having been constructed in this colonial precinct 1842. In Melbourne, the Collingwood Fire Insurance Company (with a paid up capital of 200 000 pounds) was operating in Gertude Street, Collingwood, Victoria in 1854.\n\nFire brigades in metropolitan areas were organised much along the same lines as in the United Kingdom and the United States and were funded by the insurance companies. Likewise the companies issued fire marks to be affixed to buildings to indicate where there were risks for which they had underwritten policies. Such fire marks were commonly made of tinplate, cast iron and lead.\n\nAt least one company, the Norwich Union, issued \"fire marks\" printed on calico for use in rural areas. They were to be fixed on hay ricks, corn stacks and shearing sheds on the theory that they would indicate to arsonists that the owner was insured and would not be out of pocket should the property be destroyed by fire.\n\nOne feature of the insurance company funding of fire brigades survives in some Australian states and territories in the 21st century in that the fire brigade services are principally funded by a \"fire service levy\" or tax applied to all property insurance policies issued within a state.\n\n\n"}

It is a hypothetical explanation for evolution and development of organisms, which Bergson linked closely with consciousness – the intuitive perception of experience and the flow of inner time.\n\nDistant anticipations of Bergson can be found in the work of the pre-Christian Stoic philosopher Posidonius, who postulated a \"vital force\" emanated by the sun to all living creatures on the Earth's surface, and in that of Zeno of Elea. The concept of \"élan vital\" is also similar to Arthur Schopenhauer's concept of the will-to-live and the Sanskrit \"āyus\" or \"life principle\".\n\nThe French philosopher Gilles Deleuze attempted to recoup the novelty of Bergson's idea in his book \"Bergsonism\", though the term itself underwent substantial changes by Deleuze. No longer considered a mystical, elusive force acting on brute matter, as it was in the vitalist debates of the late 19th century, \"élan vital\" in Deleuze's hands denotes an internal force, a substance in which the distinction between organic and inorganic matter is indiscernible, and the emergence of life undecidable.\n\nThe notion of \"élan vital\" had considerable influence on the psychiatrist and phenomenologist Eugène Minkowski and his own concept of a \"personal élan\" – the element which keeps us in touch with a feeling of life (and is lost in autism).\n\nThe French army incorporated the doctrine of \"élan vital\" into its thinking during the leadup to the First World War by arguing that the spirit of individual soldiers was more important for victory than weapons.\n\n\n"}

It is found on the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, Thailand and Myanmar. The casque (helmetlike structure on the head) accounts for some 11% of its 3 kg weight. Unlike any other hornbill, the casque is almost solid, and is used in head-to-head combat among males. It is a belief among the Punan Bah that a large helmeted hornbill guards the river between life and death.\n\nIt has mostly blackish plumage, except that the belly and legs are white and the tail is white with a black band near the tip of each feather. The tail is long and the two central tail feathers are much longer than the others, giving the bird a total length greater than that of any other hornbill species. The body length is , not counting the tail feathers, which boost the length a further . One male weighed in weight while two females averaged about . Although sometimes considered the largest Asian hornbill, they body weight appears to be similar to that of the great hornbill (and considerably less than the African ground hornbills).\n\nThis species has a bare, wrinkled throat patch, pale blue to greenish in females and red in males. The casque goes from the base of the bill halfway to the tip, where it ends abruptly. It and the bill are yellow; the red secretion of the preen gland covers the sides and top of the casque and the base of the bill, but often leaves the front end of the casque and the distal half of the bill yellow. Unlike other hornbills, the helmeted hornbill's casque is solid, and the skull including the casque and bill may constitute 10 percent of the bird's weight.\n\nThe call is a series of loud, intermittent barbet-like hoots, sometimes double-toned and over two dozen in number, which gradually accelerates to culminate in a cackle reminiscent of laughter.\n\nHelmeted hornbills mostly eat the fruit of strangler figs. The birds breed once a year, producing a single chick. Mother and chick live inside a sealed tree cavity for the first five months of the chick's life. Males fight over territory on the wing, ramming each other with their casques. Such encounters are called aerial jousting. Females accompany males during an approach in an aerial joust but veer off in opposite directions during the collision.\n\nIt may also use the casque as a weighted tool to dig into rotten wood and loose bark in search of insects and similar prey.\n\nAfter ongoing hunting pressure and habitat loss, the helmeted hornbill was uplisted from near threatened to critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2015. It is listed in Appendix I of CITES. According to the conservation group TRAFFIC, 2,170 casques were confiscated in just three years in China and Indonesia alone. There are fewer than 100 birds remaining in Thai forests. At least 546 hornbill parts, mostly casques of helmeted hornbills, have been posted for sale on Thai Facebook in the past five years. Traders will pay villagers 5,000-6,000 baht (US$165–200) for a hornbill head. Prices double or triple in cities and increase exponentially when sold overseas.\n\nThe casque is the source of hornbill ivory, a valuable carving material. Indigenous peoples also use the central tail feathers to decorate dancing cloaks and head-dresses. Historically, the casque was also used by carvers in China and Japan.\n\n\n"}

It was published and developed by Sofel. In Japan, the game was released as and is based on the manga series \"$1,000,000 Kid\" by Yuki Ishigaki.\n\n\"Casino Kid\" takes place in the fictional town of Lost Wages (the Japanese version uses the actual city of Las Vegas, Nevada) where the object is to earn lots of money and to defeat the evil King of the Casino. Games at the casino include blackjack and five-card draw poker. Slot machines and roulette were omitted from the North American version. While the North American version uses parody names for the Las Vegas/Lost Wages casino, the Japanese version uses the actual \"Golden Nugget\" name. The layout in the Japanese version is similar to an actual Vegas casino compared to the North American version, which looks more like a glorified lobby.\n\nIn the Japanese version, it is possible to travel to other casinos like New York City and Japan for a substantial airfare cost. Players can essentially customize the game in the Japanese version by placing in their own name. Casino Kid has blue hair in the Japanese version and blond hair in the North American version. A \"free mode\" is added into the Japanese version that allow for experimentation with gambling strategies.\n\nThere is a different introduction in the North American and Japanese version.

Both versions have waitresses in bunny costumes that gives hints to the player. Attempting to skip an opponent allow players to find the exact location of the previous opponent while skipping two or more opponents is frowned upon in this game.\n\n\"Casino Kid II\" is the sequel to \"Casino Kid\", released in North America in April 1993 by the same company. The sequel was originally going to be titled \"The Prince of Othello\" and given a 1990 release until Sofel decided to temporarily cancel the project.\n\nIn \"Casino Kid II\", the titular protagonist, after having defeated the top players in Las Vegas, is issued a challenge by the top gamblers around the world. The matches are organized by a mysterious leader, and to unveil the leader, the Casino Kid must defeat nine opponents from around the world in the games of roulette, poker, and blackjack. There is a story sequence that is more elaborate than in \"Casino Kid\". Gameplay in \"Casino Kid II\" differs in that players no longer venture around the casino looking for rival gamblers, though the card games still operate in the same fashion as in the original \"Casino Kid\". Players travel by plane to each destination either in the daytime or in the night; depending on which country that he is flying to.\n\nUnlike \"Casino Kid\", \"Casino Kid II\" was never released in Japan.

When evidence or other forms of legal assistance, such as witness statements or the service of documents, are needed from a foreign sovereign, states may attempt to cooperate informally through their respective police agencies or, alternatively, resort to what is typically referred to as requests for “mutual legal assistance.\" The practice of mutual legal assistance developed from the comity-based system of letters rogatory, though it is now far more common for states to make mutual legal assistance requests directly to the designated Central Authority within each state. In contemporary practice, such requests may still be made on the basis of reciprocity but may also be made pursuant to bilateral and multilateral treaties that obligate countries to provide assistance.\n\nThis assistance may take the form of examining and identifying people, places and things, custodial transfers, and providing assistance with the immobilization of the instruments of criminal activity. With regards to the latter, MLATs between the United States and Caribbean nations do not cover U.S. tax evasion, and are therefore ineffective when applied to Caribbean countries, which usually act as offshore \"tax havens\".\n\nAssistance may be denied by either country (according to agreement details) for political or security reasons, or if the criminal offence in question is not equally punishable in both countries. Some treaties may encourage assistance with legal aid for nationals in other countries.\n\nMany countries are able to provide a broad range of mutual legal assistance to other countries through their justice ministries even in the absence of a treaty, through joint investigations between law enforcement in both nations, emergency disclosure requests, letters rogatory, etc. In some developing countries, however, domestic laws can actually create obstacles to effective law enforcement cooperation and mutual legal assistance.\n\nFor instance, the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters is a convention to facilitate the entering into bilateral tax information exchange agreements between more than 90 states parties.\n\n\n\n"}

Its e-commerce site, www.archambault.ca, is the largest French-language retail site in North America. Archambault currently operates 14 stores in Quebec.\n\nParagraphe Bookstore, an English-language bookstore, is also part of Archambault Group.\n\nArchambault was founded in 1896 by Edmond Archambault, who had originally wanted to open a sheet music store. In partnership with J.A. Hurteau, a major retailer of pianos, instruments and music accessories, Mr. Archambault opened his first store on the corner of Saint Denis and Sainte Catherine Streets in Montreal. In 1919, Edmond Archambault became the store's sole owner, and in 1930, he decided to move to the corner of Berri and Sainte Catherine Streets, where he built a seven-storey building, which he dubbed the \"House of the Future\" and served as the home of Archambault Group's main office.\n\nMr. Archambault's died in 1947 and nephews, Rosaire Sr. and Edmond Sr., took over the reins of the business. In the 1980s, the son of Rosaire Sr., Rosaire Jr., became President. Then began a period of expansion during which many new Archambault stores opened across Quebec. The 1984 saw also the creation of Distribution Select, the largest distributor of music in Quebec.\n\nThe Archambault family sold the family-owned company to Quebecor in 1995. Rosaire Archambault Jr. was kept on as president of the Quebecor subsidiary Archambault Group Inc. until his retirement in 2000 when he was replaced by Natalie Larivière. Larivière left in 2007 and replaced by Pierre Marchand. Marchand served as president of Archambault until 2013.\n\nCamelot-Info, a computer bookstore, was acquired by Archambault in 2000.\nStarted in 1978, at its peak, Camelot-Info had six stores and an online shopping site, with 10,000 titles in its inventory. By 2007, however, in face of competition from large chain stores and the Internet, only the original flagship Phillips Square store remained.\nCamelot-Info's last store closed in January 2009.\nOn May 19, 2015, Quebecor announced the sale of 14 stores Archambault and the single store Paragraph Anglophone bookstore to Renaud-Bray Group. The sale of the retail stores was completed in September 2015.\n\nFor decades, the flagship store of Archambault was located at 500 Saint Catherine Street East. It extended on adjacent infrastructures at 510 Saint Catherine Street East and 1275 Berri Streets, forming one big store that allowed customers to go from one interconnected building to another without the need to go outside. In early 2018, the total size of the flagship store was reduced by almost 25 percent due to decrease in sales attributed to the rise of e-commerce. Among the portion of the store that was shut down was the historic 500 Saint Catherine East building that had been home to Archambault since 1930. The store remains open at 510 Saint Catherine Street East and on Berri Street.\n\n"}

It is normally grey, dark brown or black on the back. It is white on the belly. There are yellow spots on the side and a yellow stripe on the upper lip, from the back of the eye to the back of the tympanum. In metamorph frogs, this stripe is pink-orange in colour. The skin is rough and bumpy, males often have black spines on their fingers during the breeding season. This iris is silver and the pupil is vertical.\n\nThis species inhabits sandstone heathland, dry, and also wet sclerophyll forest from north of Sydney to eastern Victoria. They are called burrowing frogs because of their burrowing ability. They are also known as the \"eastern owl frog\" because of their mating call, which resembles the hooting of an owl. Males call from burrows on the edges of streams during autumn and spring after heavy rainfall. Eggs are laid in burrows on the shores of creeks and streams, to be washed into the water during heavy rainfall. The tadpoles develop in the creek and take 3–11 months. The tadpoles are very large in size, up to 80mm.\n\nThis is quite a large species of frog and the largest frog in Victoria. It is often mistaken for the cane toad because of its large size of 9 to 10 cm and bumpy skin; however, cane toads do not have vertical irises, and the range of the cane toad currently does not overlap into giant burrowing frog habitat.\n\nThese frogs can be seen sitting out on the edges of roads and walking tracks at night, after rain in areas of favourable habitat. This species has declined due to urbanisation and is mostly restricted to National Parks and State Forests.\n\n"}

{"id": "2321219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321219", "title": "Team Penske", "text": "Team Penske\n\nTeam Penske (formerly Penske Racing) is an American professional motorsports organization which has teams involved in open wheel, stock car, sports car, and touring car racing. These teams currently compete in the NTT IndyCar Series, NASCAR Cup and Xfinity Series, IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, and, in partnership with Dick Johnson Racing, the Virgin Australia Supercars Championship. Debuting at the 1966 24 Hours of Daytona, the organization has also competed in various other types of professional racing such as Can Am, Trans Am and Formula One. Altogether, Team Penske has earned over 500 victories in all of auto racing. Team Penske is a division of Penske Corporation, and is owned and chaired by Roger Penske. The team president is Tim Cindric.\n\nTeam Penske currently fields four cars: the No. 2 Verizon Dallara/Chevrolet for Josef Newgarden, the No. 3 Shell Oil Company Dallara/Chevrolet driven by Hélio Castroneves (a part-time entry since 2018 season), the No. 12 Verizon Wireless Dallara/Chevrolet driven by Will Power, and the No. 22 Penske Truck Rental Dallara/Chevrolet driven by Simon Pagenaud. Castroneves has won the Indianapolis 500 three times (2001, 2002 and 2009), as well as other CART and IRL races with Team Penske. Sam Hornish Jr. is the 2006 Indianapolis 500 winner and the (2001, 2002, and 2006) IndyCar Series Champion, with 16 IndyCar Wins. His 2001 and 2002 championships were with Panther Racing, prior to joining Team Penske.\n\nThe open-wheel racing portion of Penske Racing had been based in Reading, Pennsylvania since 1973 with the cars, during the Formula One and CART era, being constructed in Poole, Dorset, England as well as being the base for the F1 team. On October 31, 2005, Penske Racing announced after the 2006 IRL season, they would consolidate IRL and NASCAR operations at the team's Mooresville North Carolina facility; with the flooding in Pennsylvania in 2006, the team's operations were moved to Mooresville earlier than expected.\nRoger Penske has been involved with IndyCar racing since 1968, when his team first fielded a stock block-powered Eagle with Mark Donohue. The organization first competed at Indianapolis in 1969, and within three years had become the team to beat, winning the race with Donohue in 1972. In 1978, Penske along with Pat Patrick, Dan Gurney, and several other team owners who had been participating in USAC events involving cars known as Champ Cars and IndyCars formed Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART). As of June 27, 2018, Penske Racing has won the Indianapolis 500 17 times, won the Indianapolis 500 pole position 17 times, as well as 200 open wheel IndyCar wins in USAC, CART and IRL (as of May 19, 2018), 29 of which are in 500-Mile Races and 13 open wheel championships. Penske Racing has 1,463 starts in IndyCar races, 231 pole positions, 71 wins from pole, 47 double wins of which 8 are 1–2–3 finishes from the Pocono race on June 26, 1977, to January 1, 2015.\nIn 2001, team Penske marked its return to the Indy 500 after a five-year absence due to the open wheel split, after the 1995 PPG IndyCar World Series season with an Oldsmobile engines. Later, in 2001 Roger Penske announced he would leave CART for the 2002 IRL IndyCar Series season with Chevrolet engines.\nAs Toyota confirmed defection from CART Champ Car to IRL IndyCar Series, the team switched to works Toyota engines from 2003 season onwards as it was announced on April 2, 2002. The team's partnership with Toyota engines started well in 2003 including winning the 2003 Indianapolis 500 in the hands of Gil de Ferran. However Team Penske's Toyota partnership started to decline in 2004 by scored only two wins, five pole positions and three fastest laps compared to 2003 due to driver errors and also incidents. The team also resurged slightly in 2005 with just only three wins and two pole positions.\nOn October 31, 2005, it was announced that Team Penske ended their engine deal with Toyota which included Toyota's exit from IndyCar Series and reforged their historical full-works partnership with Honda with an initial five-year deal as Honda increased its IndyCar Series partnership role to exclusive global engine partner. Penske had collaborated with Honda engines in the 2000–2001 CART Champ Car season. After a prolonged period, the team announced Hélio Castroneves and Sam Hornish Jr. as their official race drivers. Despite Honda partnership, Penske had a \"de facto\" direct Honda factory support, with engines coming straight from the Japanese company's racing division in Japan and the United States including tune-up support from Ilmor Engineering in Plymouth, Michigan. The partnership started well in 2006, winning the 2006 Indianapolis 500 and 2006 IndyCar Series titles at the hands of Sam Hornish Jr..\n\nPenske retained their Castroneves - Hornish Jr. pair for the 2007 season. The second year of the renewed Honda partnership was much more promising than the first with the team coming close to defending their Indianapolis 500 victory, as well as their IndyCar Series driver and team titles. However, the team slumped, scoring only two victories due to driver errors and incidents. The team failed to win major IndyCar silverwares for the first time since the 2005 season. On November 9, 2007, Sam Hornish Jr. announced he would depart from IndyCar Series to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, driving full-time for the 2008 season with Team Penske American Le Mans Series confirming Porsche LMP2 driver Ryan Briscoe as Castroneves's new teammate for 2008 on November 13, 2007.\n\nTeam Penske started the 2008 season poorly but Hélio Castroneves posted five top four finishes (including two 2nd place finishes) to start the year. Meanwhile, Ryan Briscoe was forced to adapt the Penske IndyCar car, as Briscoe was entering his first season with Team Penske after spending two years as an IndyCar part-timer whilst he raced in the Champ Car World Series in 2006 and later the American Le Mans Series in 2007. Ryan Briscoe finally scored his first win at the Milwaukee Mile while Castroneves claimed his first 2008 win in Infineon Raceway. Castroneves nearly won the championship at Chicagoland Speedway, but Scott Dixon finished in 2nd place to ensure his 2008 IndyCar Series driver's title.\n\nFor 2009, Verizon Wireless, joined ExxonMobil as associate sponsors, and the team was billed as Verizon Championship Racing. The third car was driven by Will Power (originally a substitute for Castroneves) and carried the No. 12 and featured primary sponsorship of both the Verizon Wireless brand and Roger Penske's truck rental business.\n\nFor the 2010 season, the team entered their fifth year of its Penske-Honda partnership with Will Power promoted to a full-time Penske seat alongside Castroneves and Briscoe. Team Penske became a three-car team for the first time since 1994, with the addition of a full-time team for Power. Team Penske started the 2010 season in style by winning the first three races of the season. Will Power challenged for the driver's title until suspension failure in the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway robbed him of a shot at the championship. Penske ended up finishing the 2010 season with nine wins, thirteen pole positions and six fastest laps (mostly by Will Power).\n\nOn 12 November 2010, Penske confirmed that they would end their partnership with Honda at the end of the 2011 season and use engines supplied by Chevrolet for the 2012 season. For the 2011 season, the team entered their sixth and final year of its Penske-Honda partnership. Penske's trio of Castroneves-Briscoe-Power remained for the second consecutive year while the team lost the ExxonMobil sponsorship to Stewart-Haas Racing's NASCAR team in favor of Shell and Pennzoil as their official motor oil partner. The team started well by two victories from Will Power in the first five races. Power captured his first oval win at Texas Motor Speedway, and came into the season finale at Las Vegas 18 points behind leader Dario Franchitti. However, on lap 11 of the race, Power was collected in a fiery 15-car crash that killed defending Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon. The race was cut short in Wheldon's honor and the championship points stood as they had entering Las Vegas, giving Franchitti his third consecutive driver's title (and fourth overall). Penske finished the 2011 season with six victories, all from Will Power, while Castroneves and Briscoe went winless.\n\nRoger Penske announced a switch to Chevrolet powerplants for the 2012 IndyCar Series season. Once again, Penske would dominate the early portion of the season, winning 4 consecutive races, with Castroneves taking the season opener at St. Petersburg, and Power capturing wins at Barber, Long Beach, and São Paulo. Briscoe would have struggles throughout the season, but managed to find victory lane at Sonoma. However, Power would come up short in the championship after a crash at the season finale. Briscoe left the team after 2012 for other opportunities.\n\nIn 2014, Will Power took the IndyCar Championship for Team Penske after 3 concurrent runner up finishes in 2010–2012.\n\nThe 2015 season started well for Team Penske, Juan Pablo Montoya won the first race of the season, his second win for Penske since he arrived from NASCAR in 2014, with teammates Will Power, Helio Castroneves and Simon Pagenaud (first season with the team) finishing 2nd, 4th and 5th. Power got a win at the Grand Prix of Indianapolis in the 5th race of the season and just 2 weeks later, the Colombian Montoya won Indy 500 leading again teammate Will Power. Juan Pablo Montoya would lose the championship in the final race on a tie-breaker to Scott Dixon.\n\nTeam Penske would go on to dominate 2016, filling the top 3 positions in the final standings. Capping the season with a dominating race victory, Simon Pagenaud won his first IndyCar championship, becoming the ninth Penske driver to be crowned champion. Roger Penske's organization claimed its 14th such title and its second in three years (Power won in '14).\n\nPenske's 1994 IndyCar World Series Championship was one of, if not the most dominating performance from a race team in history of American open wheel racing. Roger Penske had found the key to win but also found a way to run from the competition. The new Penske PC-23 chassis with the Ilmor- Indy V8 engine would power the Penske drivers of Al Unser, Jr., Paul Tracy, and Emerson Fittipaldi. The team racked up 12 wins out of 16 races, collecting 10 poles and 28 podium finishes on their way to the championship. The team also dominated a controversial May at Indianapolis. Penske debuted a radical new Mercedes-Benz engine at Indy, the 500I. This engine used a provision in the rules intended for stock block pushrod engines such as the V-6 Buick engines that allowed an extra 650 cm³ and 10 inches (4.9 psi/33.8 kPa) of boost. This extra power (at least 900 horsepower, and rumored to be in excess of 1000) allowed the Penskes to run significantly faster, giving them the pole and outside front row on the grid for the 78th Indianapolis 500. Al Unser, Jr. and Emerson Fittipaldi dominated the race, eventually lapping the field with 16 laps to go in the 200 lap race when Fittipaldi made contact with the wall coming out of Turn 4, giving Al Unser, Jr. the lead and win. The only driver who finished on the lead lap was rookie Jacques Villeneuve. This one season gave Penske the Driver's Championship with Al Unser, Jr., Constructor's Cup with the Penske PC-23, and Manufacturer's Cup with the Ilmor-Indy V8 engine. (In the 1995 Indy 500 Penske failed to qualify any cars for the race)\n\nCigarette brand Marlboro had been a sponsor with Team Penske since the 1989 Indianapolis 500, and primary sponsor of all Team Penske IndyCars since 1991. Late in 2005, Team Penske announced that Marlboro would not appear on the cars any longer in accordance with the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement restricting cigarette advertising by name. In 2007, the IndyCar Series cars began to carry \"Team Penske\" insignia by removing Marlboro branding and sponsorship from Mobil 1 (although the cars remained painted in the Marlboro color scheme—in Formula 1 the Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro has a similar set up due to Marlboro partnership).\n\nIn 2010, Phillip Morris USA discontinued their relationship with Team Penske, ending a 19-year partnership. The team subsequently changed their livery to black and white with red trim (similar to McLaren when they had a black-silver livery from 1997–2005 reflecting Mercedes-Benz engines and West sponsorship), reflecting Verizon sponsorship.\nPenske first fielded a blue Sunoco 1967 Chevrolet Camaro driven by Mark Donohue in this series designed for Pony cars like the Ford Mustang. Penske-entered Camaros won the series championship in 1968 and 1969. Later they switched to a red/white/blue American Motors backed 1970 AMC Javelin, and later the restyled 1971 AMC Javelin AMX which had an aerodynamic tail spoiler and other features suggested by Donohue. American Motors won the Over 2.5 liter title in 1971, after which Penske withdrew from the championship. Penske Racing also had an alliance with pioneer Trans-Am team, Jocko's Racing which won the 1976 Trans-Am Series championship in a Penske-leased car.\n\nPenske Racing entered a Lola T70 in the 1966 Can-Am Series for Mark Donohue, resulting in one win at Mosport. In 1967, Penske Racing entered two Lolas, one for Mark Donohue and one for George Follmer. 1968 saw Penske switch to a McLaren M6, which had won the series in 1967. Donohue won one race that year in Can-Am at Bridgehampton. With the McLaren domination of the Can-Am, Penske switched back to Lola Cars for his 1969 Can-Am efforts, but only entered the car in one race at Mid-Ohio.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1974, Penske was Porsche's official partner in the CanAm Series. In late 1971, Penske and Mark Donohue helped to develop the turbocharged version of the Porsche 917. George Follmer won the series in 1972, and Donohue dominated CanAm in 1973 with the ultimate evolution of the 917, the 917/30. The rules were changed for 1974, and Penske raced only once this year.\nA Lola T70 Mk IIIb entered by Penske was the surprise winner of the 1969 24 Hours of Daytona.\n\nDuring the 1970 season the competition between the 5-liter sportscars of Porsche and Ferrari turned to the advantage of the Porsche 917. In 1971, Ferrari decided to give up any official effort with the 5-liter Ferrari 512. In order to prepare the 1972 season, the new works prototype Ferrari 312PB was presented and engaged by the factory in several races.\n\nRoger Penske bought a used 512 M chassis that was totally dismantled and rebuilt. The car was specially tuned for long races receiving many unique features, among them were a large rear wing and an aviation inspired quick refueling system. The engine was tuned by CanAm V8 specialist Traco, and was probably able to deliver more than 600 hp (450 kW). As of today it's unknown to what extent Penske's initiative was backed by Ferrari works. This 512M was painted in a blue and yellow livery and was sponsored by Sunoco and the Californian Ferrari dealer Kirk F. White. The car made the pole position for the 1971 24 Hours of Daytona and finished second despite an accident. For the 12 Hours of Sebring the \"Sunoco\" made the pole again but finished the race at the sixth position after making contact with Pedro Rodrigez's 917. Despite this misfortune the car had proved to be a serious opponent for the 917. Not only this car was the fastest on track in Daytona and Sebring but it was also the car that had the shortest refueling time.\n\nThe presence of the 512 M \"Sunoco\" forced Porsche to pursue his effort of research and development on the 917: The 917K short tail was modified, and the 917 LH aerodynamics received further improvements. New Magnesium chassis were developed. An entirely new car, the 917/20 was built as test-bed for future CanAm parts and aerodynamic \"low-drag\" concepts.\n\nIn Le Mans the \"Sunoco\" Ferrari was unable to break the 200 mph (320 km/h) barrier on the straight while the Porsche 917 LH were lightning quick at speeds of over 240 mph (380 km/h). Mark Donohue qualified fourth anyway, which was obviously the result of an aerodynamic configuration that favored downforce over drag, which helped in the twistier sections. The car did not have much luck in the race though.\n\nIn April 2005, it was announced that Porsche would build an Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) sanctioned LMP2 Class Prototype that would be entered by Penske Racing in the American Le Mans Series and thus formally competed as DHL Porsche Penske Racing in a reference of Porsche Motorsport works team. The Porsche RS Spyder made its successful debut at the ALMS season final race at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. The \"Porsche Junioren\" factory drivers Sascha Maassen and Lucas Luhr finished 1st in LMP2 Class and 5th Overall in the 4–Hour Endurance Race. The livery of Penske Racing American Le Mans Series team was inspired by Jordan EJ12's DHL Formula 1 livery driven by Giancarlo Fisichella and Takuma Sato.\n\nIn 2006, Penske Motorsports fielded two LMP2 Porsche RS Spyder in the American Le Mans Series, but did not run the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans in June. The Penske cars combined to win seven class victories and the overall win at Mid-Ohio. Penske Racing won the LMP2 team championship. Drivers Sascha Maassen and Lucas Luhr tied for first place in the driver's championship, while Timo Bernhard finished fifth, Romain Dumas finished sixth, and Emmanuel Collard finished tenth.\n\n2006 team lineup:\n\nIn 2007, Penske Motorsports fielded two LMP2 Porsche RS Spyder Evo in the American Le Mans Series. Penske Motorsports for the 2nd year in a row did not compete in 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans in June. Penske's two cars combined for eleven class victories and eight overall victories during the twelve race season. Penske won the LMP2 team championship, and team drivers Romain Dumas and Timo Bernhard finished tied for first in the LMP2 driver's championship, while Sascha Maassen and Ryan Briscoe tied for third place.\n\n2007 team lineup:\n\nPenske started out their 2008 season with an overall win in the 12 Hours of Sebring. This was Porsche's first overall win in the race since 1988 in a Porsche 962.\n\n2008 team lineup:\n\nIn 2009, the No. 6 and No. 7 ALMS teams were used for Penske's No. 12 Indycar, driven by Will Power in five races. The team announced in late 2009 that the ALMS teams would be dissolved and turned into the new No. 12 Verizon sponsored Indycar for Will Power to run full-time in 2010.\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that Penske Racing would make a comeback to sportscar racing in IMSA's WeatherTech SportsCar Championship for the 2018 season. They will run 2 Acura ARX-05 DPis in the prototype (P) class. They ran the last race of 2017, the Petit Le Mans using the Oreca 07 LMP2 that the Acura DPi is based off, placing third.\n\n2018 line-up:\n\n2019-2021 line-up:\n\nPenske entered the Formula One World Championship from 1974 to 1976. Although the cars were built at the British base in Poole, the team held an American licence. In 1971, Penske had sponsored the second McLaren entry in the 1971 Canadian and US GP, entering Mark Donohue, who took the car to a podium finish. The team returned three years later, in the 1974 Canadian GP, with their own chassis, the PC1, a standard tub built around a Cosworth DFV engine and a Hewland gearbox. Donohue took the car to 12th place on its debut. In 1975, Roger Penske mounted a full season attack with the PC1, Donohue managing to score a fifth place in the Swedish GP. However, the car was retired after the French GP and Penske entered a March 751 for the next three races, scoring another fifth in the British GP. However, Donohue crashed the car in the final practice session of the 1975 Austrian Grand Prix at Spielberg and later died from his injuries. Penske missed the Italian race, returning only for the US GP, abandoning the March 751 in favor of the PC1 with Northern Irish driver John Watson.\n\nFor 1976, Penske signed a sponsorship deal with Citibank and entered a brand new PC3 for Watson. In spite of a fifth place scored at the South African Grand Prix at Kyalami, the PC3 was evolved into the PC4, which was much more competitive, allowing Watson to score two podiums in France and Britain. Then, in the Austrian Grand Prix, the team scored their only F1 win. So far this has been the last time an American constructor won a F1 race. Still, at the end of the year, Penske decided to withdraw from the sport to concentrate solely on Indycar racing, selling the remains of his European operations to Günter Schmid of Germany.\n\nFor 1977, the car was entered by Schmidt's ATS Wheels business and run under the name of ATS Racing Team. The ATS-Penske PC4, now painted yellow, debuted in the 1977 United States Grand Prix West with Jean-Pierre Jarier at the wheel, where the Frenchman scored the team's single point of the season. A second PC4 was eventually entered for Hans Heyer (who started the 1977 German Grand Prix despite failing to qualify) and Hans Binder (3 races) but the team's fortunes sank and Schmidt quit after the Italian GP, before returning in 1978 with his own chassis. A third PC4 was built by Penske for Interscope Racing, who entered the car in the United States and Canadian Grands Prix, driven by American Danny Ongais with no results.\n\nIn 1979 Penske designed and built the HR100 for wealthy Mexican 'gentleman driver' Héctor Rebaque. The car was entered for the final three races of the season, but either failed to qualify or to finish in each case.\n\nIn 2015, Team Penske entered the Australian V8 Supercars Championship, having purchased a 51% stake in Dick Johnson Racing in September 2014. The team is known as DJR Team Penske. The team raced a single Ford Falcon FG X in 2015, initially with Marcos Ambrose driving car No. 17 and Scott Pye as a co-driver in the Endurance Cup. Following the Australian Grand Prix support race, Ambrose requested to step aside from driving to let Scott Pye become the main driver from Round 2 at Symmons Plains onwards. Ambrose then became the endurance co-driver in the Endurance Cup.\n\nIn October 2015, DJR Team Penske announced a return to a two-car team in 2016 with Fabian Coulthard to drive car No. 12 and Scott Pye in car No. 17. Roger Penske later confirmed that Ambrose elected not to continue as a co-driver in 2016.\n\nFor the 2017 season, Scott McLaughlin joined the team and became the new driver for the No. 17 Ford Falcon FG X Supercar.\nDJR Team Penske took out the 2017 Teams Championship, and in the following year Scott McLaughlin took out the 2018 Drivers Championship in the Virgin Australia Supercars Championship. \nIn 2019 he took out his second Drivers Championship winning an Australian Touring Cars/Supercars record of 18 races and with co-driver Alex Premat, Scott McLaughlin won his first Bathurst 1000.\n\nPenske Racing has the most Indianapolis 500 victories of any team in auto-racing history with 18 victories. In 1972, Penske driver Gary Bettenhausen led the most laps but lost an engine with 24 laps to go. His teammate Mark Donohue led the waning laps en route to Penske's first Indianapolis 500 victory. In 1979, Penske driver Bobby Unser led the most laps of the Indianapolis 500 while teammate Rick Mears won the race, from the pole.\n\nPenske's next \"500\" victory was one of the most controversial finishes in IndyCar history. Penske driver Unser won the pole position and led the most of the final 100 laps. On lap 140, Bobby Unser and former Penske driver Mario Andretti came out of the pits. Unser passed 11 cars under a yellow flag while Andretti passed 2 cars. Unser won the race, but was stripped of the victory the next morning in favor of Andretti. After a lengthy appeal, Unser was reinstated the victory and was instead fined $40,000 ($104,000 in today's money). Unser retired from racing after the season was over in the fall-out of the controversy.\n\nPenske's next Indy 500 win was with Rick Mears in 1984. Mears and former Penske driver Tom Sneva battled for the lead in the final 100 laps but after Sneva dropped out with a broken CV joint, Mears led the final 40 laps unchallenged to win by 2-laps ahead of the field. The next year, first-year Penske driver Danny Sullivan led the final 61 laps en route to his first Indianapolis 500 victory after winning a 4-lap shootout with Mario Andretti. In 1987, Penske driver Danny Ongais got taken out of the race due to injuries and former Penske driver Al Unser was tabbed as a temporary replacement. Unser won the race.\n\n1988 was one of the most dominating performances by Penske Racing in the history of the Indianapolis 500. Penske's team members, Sullivan, Unser and Mears qualified in the front row and proceeded to lead 192 of the race's 200 laps, 91 by Sullivan, 89 by Mears, and 12 by Unser. Mears won the race. In 1991, Mears won an 18-lap duel with Michael Andretti to win his 4th Indianapolis 500. Emerson Fittipaldi won the 500 in 1993 but angered American fans by drinking orange juice instead of the traditional milk.\n\nIn 1994, the Penske team, consisting of Al Unser Jr., Paul Tracy and Emerson Fittipaldi led 193 of the race's 200 laps, thanks to a new engine invented by Penske that went up to 1000 horsepower. The engine was later banned, which resulted in Penske Racing not qualifying a single car in the 1995 Indianapolis 500.\n\nDue to the open-wheel split, Penske did not field a car at the Indianapolis 500 from 1996-2000. In 2001, Penske Racing crossed a picket-line by fielding the team in the 500, consisting of rookie Hélio Castroneves and Gil de Ferran. The duo proceeded to lead the most laps, en route to the victory, giving Penske Racing a 1-2 finish, the first time in the team's history. In a post-race interview, Roger Penske said that after the heartbreak in 1995, the win was the biggest of all his Indy 500 wins.\n\nIn 2002, Castroneves barely beat Paul Tracy to win his second consecutive Indy 500. Controversy overshadowed the race when video tapes appeared to have shown that Tracy was ahead of Castroneves at the moment of a final-lap caution. After a lengthy appeal, Castroneves' win was upheld on July 2. In 2003, Gil de Ferran won his first 500 and then retired when the season was over. Penske Racing has since proceeded to win the 500 in 2006, 2009, 2015, 2018, and 2019.\n\nOpened in 2002, the Penske Racing Museum in Scottsdale, Arizona, is located within a complex of Penske Automotive Group car dealerships at the Scottsdale 101 Auto Collection. The two-story, museum houses approximately 20 historically significant Penske Racing cars, along with trophies, artwork, engines and other memorabilia dating from Penske Racing's earliest origins up to the present day. Displays are rotated on a regular basis, but the museum focuses primarily on the team's successes in the Indy 500 and NASCAR, with lesser emphasis on F1 and sports car racing.\n\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Season still in progress\n\n"}

The allied forces of Mercia and Wessex met an army of Northumbrian Vikings in Mercia.\n\nAfter successful raids by Danish Vikings, significant parts of northeastern England, formerly Northumbria, were under their control. Danish attacks into central England had been resisted and effectively reduced by Alfred the Great, to the point where his son, King Edward of Wessex, could launch offensive attacks against the foreigners. Edward was allied with the Mercians under his sister Æthelflæd, and their combined forces were formidable. The allies launched a five-week campaign against Lindsey in 909, and successfully captured the relics of Saint Oswald of Northumbria.\n\nThe Vikings quickly sought retaliation for the Northern excursion. In 910, the Danelaw kings assembled a fleet and transported a Danish army, via the River Severn, directly into the heart of Mercia. There they ravaged the land and collected large amounts of valuable plunder, but quickly sought to return north rather than be trapped in hostile territory. However an army of West Saxons and Mercians caught them at Wednesfield, near Tettenhall, and according to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" defeated them and inflicted losses of many thousands including two or three kings.\n\nWhile little is known of the exact manoeuvres employed at the battle, it is obvious the allies trapped their Viking opponents and inflicted heavy casualties on them. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" states that \"many thousands of men\" were killed, referring to the Danes. Seemingly unable to retreat, the kings leading the Viking raid were both killed by the allied troops.\n\nWith the Northern Danes subdued, the forces of Wessex and Mercia could be focused against those who had settled further south. It was also the defeat of the last great raiding army from Denmark to ravage England. With allied strength rising, England was soon united under one domestic monarch.\n\n"}

After the 1660 Restoration, he sat on over 122 Parliamentary Committees, particularly those connected with finance. \n\nAlthough Presbyterian by upbringing, he voted in favour of the 1673 and 1678 Test Acts, requiring holders of public office to be members of the Church of England. He himself conformed, supported the exclusion of the Catholic James II in 1679, and backed the 1689 Glorious Revolution.\n\nConsidered a \"great Parliamentarian\", his contemporary Gilbert Burnet summarised him as follows; \"He was the roughest and boldest speaker in the House, and talked in the language and phrases of a carrier, but with a beauty and eloquence that was always acceptable. He spoke always with much life and heat, but judgment was not his talent.\"\n\nJohn Birch was born 7 September 1615, second but eldest surviving son of Samuel and Mary Birch. His father was a wealthy Presbyterian merchant, who owned Ardwick Manor, outside Manchester. He had two brothers, Samuel (1621-1683), and Thomas (1633-1700). He moved to Bristol in 1633, where he set up as a wine merchant.\n\nBirch married Alice Deane (died 1671), daughter of a Bristol merchant. They had five children who lived to adulthood; John (\"ca\". 1647 – after 1683), Samuel (died 1704), Mary (\"ca\". 1645–1728), Elizabeth and Sarah (died 1702). There were no children from his second marriage to Winifred Norris, who died in 1717.\n\nWhen the First English Civil War began in 1642, Birch was a captain in the Bristol militia, and served in the Parliamentarian garrison. In the early stages, some viewed it as a break from routine, with better pay and rations than in civilian life; he later recorded some were concerned it might end too soon.\n\nWhen the Royalists captured the town in June 1643, the garrison was given a pass to London. With the help of Sir Arthur Haselrig, Birch was commissioned in the army commanded by William Waller, and quickly proved an energetic and courageous officer. In November 1643, he served in the first Siege of Basing House, and was slightly wounded in the Battle of Alton on 13 December. Less than a week later, he was shot in the stomach in an assault on Arundel Castle, allegedly surviving only because the cold weather stemmed the flow of blood.\n\nAfter recovering, he took part in the Battle of Cheriton in March 1644; at Cropredy Bridge in June, he commanded the rearguard that held the bridge long enough for Waller's main force to retreat. He later served in Wales and the south-west, and led the attack that took Hereford on 17 December 1645. He fought at Stow-on-the-Wold in March 1646, and captured Goodrich Castle in June, just before the war ended.\n\nIn September 1646, Birch was elected to fill a vacancy as MP for Leominster. He was appointed High steward of Leominster in 1648, and invested heavily in purchasing church lands, which made him extremely wealthy.\n\nDisputes over a peace settlement with Charles I, and religious policy, split Parliament between moderates like Birch, and more radical religious Independents such as Oliver Cromwell, who dominated the New Model Army. Although he did not take part in the Second English Civil War, he was one of the MPs excluded from Parliament in Pride's Purge of 6 December 1648.\n\nHe met with Charles II prior to the Battle of Worcester in September 1651; he avoided direct participation, unlike his former colleague Edward Massey, who later became a political opponent. He retained his Leominster seat throughout the Protectorate, although he was not allowed to take his seat, and later claimed to have been arrested 21 times. After the 1660 Restoration, he was removed as High Steward of Leominster, and forced to sell his lands back to the church, ending his influence in the area. However, in 1661 he was returned as MP for Penryn, in the Cavalier Parliament.\n\nAlthough he never held high political office, Birch sat on numerous committees, especially those connected to public spending and taxes, where he proved a relentless and astute auditor. His presence on the committee to review naval expenditure after the Second Anglo-Dutch War brought him into contact with Pepys, who noted he \"do take it upon him to defend us, and do mightily do me right in all his discourse\".\n\nThe 1662 Act of Uniformity expelled Presbyterians from the Church of England, who thus became Protestant Nonconformists. They included John, and his brother Samuel (1621-1680), who was evicted from his parish of Bampton as a result. However, Birch voted for the 1673 Test Act, which required holders of public office holders to be Anglicans, and became a member of the church. This was largely due to his opposition to Catholicism, and in the Exclusion Crisis, he supported barring Charles' Catholic brother James from the throne.\n\nBirch purchased Garnstone Manor, Weobly, in 1661, giving him control of its Parliamentary seat. First elected in 1679, he held it until his death in 1691, with the exception of 1685, when he stood down following the accession of James II. He regained it after the November 1688 Glorious Revolution, and was prominent in debates over the Bill of Rights and the Revolutionary settlement.\n\nHis last recorded Parliamentary appearance was in April 1690; he died at home on 10 May 1691, and was buried at St Peter and St Paul's, Weobley. The railings around his monument extended into the altar space, and were removed in 1694 by Gilbert Ironside, Bishop of Hereford; the holes are still visible. His youngest daughter, Sarah, inherited Garnstone, on condition she marry her cousin, another John Birch; he held the Weobley seat almost continuously from 1701, until his death in 1735.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2321242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321242", "title": "Alien Racers", "text": "Alien Racers\n\nAlien Racers is an American computer action series originally aired on Fox's \"FoxBox\" (later known as 4Kids TV) in May 2005. It formerly aired in Canada on Teletoon.\n\nXenoc, the heart of the universe, holds the valuable energy source known as Xeno-energy. It has the power to create or destroy. For eons, this cosmic energy gathered and destroyed civilizations until the wisest and oldest species , Zenterrans, managed to land containment chambers on the planet surface, which they built with the help of Fyran mechanics. Fearing that every race would be warring over the contained energy, the Zenterran Master Khadan issued a contest. Each alien civilization would choose a champion to race for this great power, and whoever controls the most Xeno-energy will decide the fate of the universe. Since the Zenterrans maintain their neutrality, even the Kragnans were welcome to compete. The Kragnan Empire, a race of fierce crablike creatures who travel in spaceships made of lava and land vehicles made of bones (which they built using knowledge they obtained from the Fyran brains they consumed), have enslaved or eaten half of the universe. They seek more energy for their new generation of eggs. The protagonist, Ultrox, knows there is more to Xeno-energy than even the Zenterrans know. While studying a planet damaged by Xeno-energy, he notices a Kragnan ship crash-land nearby. He saves its imprisoned occupant, a Fyran boy named Jek, from a squad of Klaw Troopers. Just before he was vaporized by another Kragnan ship, the gangster named Seadrok dropped his space anchor on the ship, thus saving his life. After persuading him by also dropping the Ne'tal champion G'rog, Ultrox joins the races as Alpheron's champion.\n\nOn the planet Krag, the Kragnans, knowing that they can't steal the Xeno-energy or eat the Zenterran brains (when the Kragnan Warlord Zanth ate Undermaster Akhil's father's brain, the power proved so overwhelming that his body exploded), entered one of their warlords, Gnarl, into the races. The Zenterrans created an enforcer from Xeno-energy named Gamekeeper Kytani to enforce the strict set of rules they imposed on the races. During the first race, Jek followed Kommander Necraal, the Kragnan Klaw Trooper who had kidnapped his uncle, until he kidnaps the young Fyran and tells him they ate his uncle's brain. In an attempt to fix the race, Skrash, the lone zombie native to Xenoc, detonated a mountain in the hopes of taking the other racers with it.\n\nAfter the first race, the Kragnan commander attempts to steal the Command Matrix. But when Ultrox and Khadan warned Necraal of the trap Undermaster Akhil set that would unleash Xeno-energy on the entire Kragan Empire, Undermaster Akhil mind-controlled the Kragnan into springing it. The resulting trap sent destructive streams of Xeno-energy to every Kragnan like Necraal, except Gnarl, who was shielded at the time. Master Khadan explained that the Xeno-energy only wiped out the Kragnans identical to the commander, so because they did not match Necraal's pattern, the Empress and her new breed of eggs were spared. Even though he saved the universe from the threat of the Kragnan Empire, Akhil was executed for his illegal use of mind-control, but promised to return. The Zenterrans continued to hold the races, while Gnarl continued to compete in them in the hopes of winning enough Xenocells to restore his empire's former glory. Meanwhile, Ultrox has to keep winning Xeno-cells for Alpheron as much as possible so he can continue to study Xeno-energy. But because he often neglects the rules and the races to save people, he is often disqualified from races he would otherwise win, and Alpheron's Minister Prime Apex often comes close to replacing him.\n\nAs the races progressed, Ultrox discovered that the Xeno-energy was becoming more violent because of the races, and a new more violent and unpredictable form of it called rogue Xeno-energy was steadily growing throughout Xenoc.\n\n\n\nThis violent energy is the lifeblood of Xenoc. For eons, it destroyed civilization after civilization until the Zenterrans contained it. It also keeps the planet's lone native inhabitant, Skrash, alive. The Zenterrans, with help from Jek's kind, built chambers with Command Matrixes to contain the energy. The equations were so complex that only the Zenterrans knew how to access it. In Powershift Part 2, Ultrox discovered that the Xeno-energy was containing itself in the Xeno-boosters, which is a result of the active Command Matrix equations. He said Xeno-energy it isn't alive, but it tries to be.\n\nXeno-boosters<br>\nSmall disc-shaped scanners containing a small amount of xeno-energy that powers anything it touches. It turbo-charged anything it's used on for ten seconds. The Zenterrans retrieve all the unused ones at the end of the races.\n\nXenocells<br>\nA Xenocell is a capsule containing a large amount of stable Xenoenergy that is presented to the winner of each race. Unfortunately, they are difficult to use, so the Zenterran have to send a technician to help the winning planet make use of them. Once he complete his task, the technician reports back to Master Khadan, except when he gave Kreff shapeshifting abilities, after which he was captured by the Kragnans while Kreff returned disguised as the Zenterran Technician.\n\n"}

It was originally created as an initiative of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) association to encourage the use of a common digital identity and digital signature standard for the pharmaceutical industry, but is now an independent non-profit association offering such standards services to the government and the entire healthcare industry.\n\nThe SAFE-BioPharma industry standard is used to establish and manage digital identities and to issue and apply digital signatures. It mitigates legal, regulatory and business risk associated with business-to-business and business-to-regulator electronic transactions. It also facilitates interoperability by providing a secure, enforceable, and regulatory-compliant way to verify identities of parties involved in electronic transactions.\n\nSAFE-BioPharma's vision is to be a catalyst in transforming the biopharmaceutical and healthcare communities to a fully electronic business environment by 2012.\n\nThe SAFE-BioPharma digital identity and signature standard operates one of the nation's leading public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate authority bridges. These PKI certificate bridges establish an infrastructure for the trusted exchange of confidential information and the reliable authentication of identities over the Internet. By providing a highly secure way to validate, trust, and manage identities of unknown participants in an Internet transaction, the SAFE-BioPharma Bridge Certificate Authority (SBCA) is essential to helping achieve the speed, efficiency and cost-savings inherent in use of the Internet for business transactions.

It serves various kinds of hot and cold subs, wraps, and salads.\n\nIn March 1967, 21-year-old Brian J. McLaughlin and Jay Howland opened \"Ma Riva's Sub Shop\" in Dedham, Massachusetts. The name was later changed to Angelo Sub Shop, and the letter D was added around 1978, supposedly standing for \"delicious.\" D'Angelo sold salads, Syrian pocket bread and sub sandwiches. Their most popular sub was the Steak and Cheese sandwich.\n\nD'Angelo owned Liberty Bakery which baked and delivered all the bread to each store. They also owned Progressive Foods distribution center which delivered all the food to each store every week. Later they added a USDA meat processing plant to shave the 50,000 lbs. of steak consumed each week.\n\nBeginning in the mid 1980s, many of the D'Angelo locations were co-branded and the store footprints were reworked to include full service Steve's Ice Cream counters. After several years, the Steve's component was rebranded as \"Chip's\". \n\nIn 1993 PepsiCo bought D'Angelo with the intent to grow the chain into a national brand alongside its other properties such as Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken; however, this plan never came to fruition.

It was released by Sub Pop in 1996.\n\nIt is the second and final Sebadoh album to feature drummer Bob Fay, who replaced founding member Eric Gaffney in 1994.\n\nThe album cover features a photograph of a pharmacy in Cashel, Ireland, taken by band member Jason Loewenstein on tour. The missing \"P\" gave the album its title.\n\nAs with its predecessor, \"Bakesale\", the songwriting on \"Harmacy\" was handled primarily by Loewenstein and founding member Lou Barlow, with Fay contributing the lone track, \"Sforzando!\", and the band covering \"I Smell a Rat\" by American hard rock band The Bags. Their cover was featured on the soundtrack for the 1998 American comedy-thriller film \"Homegrown\".\n\nLike \"Bakesale\", the album was a \"(relatively) polished production\", and featured pervasive use of electric guitars and longer song structures, marking a clear departure from the band's lo-fi, often acoustic earlier albums like their release, \"Sebadoh III\" (1991).\n\nSolo acoustic versions of \"On Fire\" and \"Willing to Wait\" were released prior to the album's release, on the 1994 \"Rebound\" single and the 1995 compilation \"\", respectively.\n\nReleased in the wake of Barlow's Top 40 hit, \"Natural One\", with his band The Folk Implosion, \"Harmacy\" became Sebadoh's first charting album in the U.S., expanding on the success of \"Bakesale\", and yielding the Modern Rock Tracks hit, \"Ocean\".\n\nThe album was well received by critics, albeit less so than \"Bakesale\". Stephen Thompson of \"The Onion's\" \"The A.V. Club\" wrote that \"Harmacy\" \"doesn't have \"Bakesale\"s considerable staying power as a whole, but the strong balance of soft pop songs (\"Too Pure\", \"Perfect Way\", the elegant pop ballad \"Willing to Wait\") and abrasively punky rock songs (\"Love To Fight\", \"Mind Reader\", \"Can't Give Up\") still holds together somehow.\"\n\n\"Harmacy\" was included on several year-end lists in 1996, including \"Rolling Stone\" \"Ten Best Albums\" (#8), the \"Village Voice\"s \"Pazz & Jop Critics' Poll\" (#36), and the \"NME\"s critics' poll (#38).\n\nThe album was supposed to be reissued in 2011, along with \"Bakesale\", but never was.
