He was the son of Spytek of Melsztyn, voivode of Kraków.\n\nHe supported the plan for Władysław II Jagiełło's acceptance of the Czech crown from the Hussite's. He supported pro-Hussite military expeditions of Sigismund Korybut to Bohemia in the years 1422-1427. After Jagiełło's death in 1434 he was the leader of the opposition against the political influences of Bishop of Kraków, Zbigniew Oleśnicki during the early years of the reign of young King Władysław III. Spytek's opposition to Oleśnicki was less personal and more an expression of sympathy with Czech Hussitism, and of opposition to the wealth and influence of the Catholic Church in Poland. During Church synods of Warka (1434), Sieradz and Piotrkow (1435) he spoke in favor of the abolishing of the Peter's Pence in Poland.\n\nIn 1439 he organized the Korczyn Confederation (also known as \"Confederation of Spytko of Melsztyn\") against Oleśnicki. This was a reaction to Oleśnicki 's formation of an earlier anti-Hussite confederation there. His actions were condemned by the royal court, and he lost much support. Following a military escalation of the conflict, he died in the Battle of Grotniki on 4 May 1439. Spytek's defeat meant also the defeat of the Hussite cause in Poland.\n\nHis legacy lay in King Władysław's realization that the lesser nobility could be played off against the power of the great magnates and that the Catholic Church could be reigned in.\n"}

{"id": "1870596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870596", "title": "King's Quest I", "text": "King's Quest I\n\nKing's Quest is an adventure game developed by Sierra On-Line and published originally for the IBM PCjr in 1984 and later for several other systems between 1984 and 1989. The game was originally titled simply as \"King's Quest\"; the subtitle Quest for the Crown was added to the game box in the 1987 re-release, but did not appear in the game itself.\n\nIt is the first official part of the long \"King's Quest\" series (not counting 1980's \"Wizard and the Princess\"), in which a young knight, Sir Graham, must save the Kingdom of Daventry to become the king. Designed by Roberta Williams, the game was revolutionary and highly influential in the evolution of the graphic adventure game genre by introducing more detailed graphics and animation.\n\nAn official remake titled Roberta Williams' King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown was released in 1990. An unofficial remake was released by Tierra Entertainment in 2001.\n\n\"King's Quest\" features interactive graphics that were an enormous leap over the mostly static 'rooms' of previous graphical interactive fiction. Prior to \"King's Quest\", the typical adventure game presented the player a pre-drawn scene, accompanied by a text description. The player's interaction with the game consisted entirely of typing commands into the game's parser, then reading the parser's response, as the on-screen graphics rarely changed (except when the player moved to a new location).\n\n\"King's Quest\" is the first adventure game to integrate graphical animation into the player's view of game world. Because of this, \"King's Quest\" shifts the focus away from the static scenery, to the player's character, which is animated on-screen. There are animation sequences for most player-world interactions reachable through the normal course of exploration. For example, there are animation sequences showing Graham picking up objects from the ground, opening doors, and wading through water. Depth perspective is simulated as well; Graham can walk behind objects, causing his character to be hidden from view, or walk in front of them, obscuring the object. This attention to graphical animation, while commonplace in action games, earned \"King's Quest\" the distinction as the first \"3D-animated\" adventure game.\n\nThe original version of the game relies primarily on textual input as its interface. As the player uses the keyboard to explore the game world, the on-screen character, Graham, is animated walking to the chosen destination. The fantasy world of Daventry consists of an 8×6 cyclic array of screens (or rooms) that make up the outdoor world in which the player can navigate freely (except for the screen South of the East end of the castle, which must be reached by special means), plus 30 or so additional screens for indoor and underground places (including a smaller world in the clouds).\n\n\"King's Quest\" was innovative in its use of 16-color graphics for the IBM PC platform. The game used the PCjr and Tandy 1000's Video Gate Array and enhanced sound, and those with the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) computers could display 16-color graphics with artifact colors on a composite color monitor or television. Selecting 'RGB mode' at the title screen would instead result in the usual 320×200 CGA graphics mode limited to 4 colors. In this mode, dithering was employed to simulate extra colors. Like previous static-screen Sierra adventures, \"King's Quest\" used vector graphics rather than pre-rendered bitmaps which would take far too much disk space. Each screen is drawn line-by-line and painted in. This technique was used on all Sierra adventure games up to \"King's Quest V\".\n\nIn the original version for the IBM PCjr, the story was simple. The Kingdom of Daventry is suffering from recent disasters and hardship. King Edward calls his bravest knight, Sir Grahame, to his throne, and tells him he has heard of three legendary treasures hidden throughout the land that would end Daventry's troubles. If Grahame succeeds he will become king. In later releases, the knight's name was changed to Graham.\n\nSince the game's fourth release (1984) and the repackaged fifth release (1987), the backstory was greatly expanded. The Kingdom of Daventry is in serious trouble, after its precious magical items have been stolen. One day, King Edward the Benevolent rescued a beautiful young Princess Dahlia of Cumberland, but on the night of their wedding she was discovered to be really an evil witch who stole the king's treasure. Knowing that he had to save the kingdom, the dying King Edward sends his bravest knight, Sir Graham, to Cumberland on the quest to rid of the treacherous witch, outwit the other assorted villains, and retrieve the three lost treasures. Because he had no heir, if Graham should succeed, he would become the next king.\n\nSir Graham embarked upon a quest for the items through Daventry, climbing a magic beanstalk to the Land of the Clouds where he recovered the chest of gold, facing leprechauns to retrieve the shield and a dragon to get back the mirror. After retrieving all of the items, Graham returned to the throne room in time to present them to the king before he died. As the king died, he passed on rule of Daventry to Sir Graham as promised.\n\nIn late 1982, IBM contacted Sierra On-Line for launch titles for its forthcoming PCjr home computer, announced in November 1983. Among the software Sierra developed was \"King's Quest\", the first animated adventure game. To create the interactive animation, the \"King's Quest\" development process deployed a prototype version of what would eventually become the Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) game engine. This prototype engine was developed by Arthur Abraham, who was let go from the \"King's Quest\" project in the middle of development. In some early reporting on the game, the development system was referred to as the \"Game Adaptation Language\" (GAL). In addition to the designer and writer Roberta Williams, six full-time programmers worked for 18 months to complete the game.\n\nIBM, which paid for much of the $850,000 development cost, requested a sophisticated and replayable adventure game. IBM stated in advertisements that \"King's Quest\" \"runs on the IBM PCjr and makes good use of some special PCjr capabilities\", with \"unusually smooth and realistic\" animation and \"an impressive variety of sound effects\". Its discontinuation of the computer in March 1985 stunned Sierra. Due to the PCjr's poor reception, \"King's Quest\" did not sell very well. With the advantage of the development system, Sierra was able to quickly release versions for the Tandy 1000, standard PCs, and the Apple IIe, which helped propel sales.\n\nSelf-booting IBM PC compatible versions, requiring 128 KB of memory:\n\nThe game was re-released for DOS in 1986 using Sierra's updated AGI version 2 engine. It was also ported to the Amiga and Atari ST at the same time, and eventually to the Sega Master System. This 256K DOS version of \"King's Quest\" lacks some sound effects present in the booter versions, including birds chirping and distinct sounds for each enemy. It also adds some musical cues from \"King's Quest II\", including \"Greensleeves\" replacing the original simple fanfare at the title screen. Background pictures are now drawn into an off-screen buffer to avoid the painting effect of the original game. This was not done merely for the sake of tidiness, but because the booter versions inadvertently gave away some puzzle solutions by drawing hidden objects first, followed by scenery.\n\nIBM PC compatible versions running under DOS, requiring 256K memory. All versions published by Sierra.\n\n\nAll floppy-disk based releases of the 128K and 256K versions use different forms of on-disk copy protection.\n\nOther versions:\n\n\"King's Quest\" was not ported to the Commodore 64, despite its being the most important computer-game platform. Roberta Williams said that the limitations of its graphic system (three colors per 8x8 block) did not permit Sierra to get the level of graphics detail they wanted. In addition, the computer's 64k of memory was too small to fit the complex AGI engine into. She said that she would always wanted to make an adventure game with animation, but it was not possible up to that point.\n\nThe 1989 Master System port uses its own engine, with a verb/noun interface similar to early LucasArts titles. It has original tile and sprite-based graphics and was published by Parker Brothers, who in turn outsourced development to micro smiths, as they had done for a port of their own \"Montezuma's revenge\". The game is based on the original \"King's Quest\", and shares the puzzles and points-list of that game. Some of the puzzles and rooms have been modified a bit (for example, the boulder covering the dagger rolls a different direction than in PC). An extra item exists — it is now possible to pick up the three-leaf clovers. There are some extra places to die (including a dangerous staircase added to exit of the Leprechauns' realm). It is non-linear, and the three treasures can be collected in any order, like in the original PC version. Game saves were done through passwords.\n\n\"King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown\" is a 1990 remake of \"King's Quest\". This release is the \"Enhanced\" version of \"King's Quest\". It uses the Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) engine, the same engine used in titles such as \"\"; while it still used 16-color graphics, it featured twice the resolution as well as music card support instead of the PC speaker. There are two different box variations for this release: one that used the same gold slipcover box as the 1987 256K version 2.0F and a box created specifically for the remake.\n\nThe game is not a 1:1 remake. The story was expanded upon (mainly in the cutscenes and conversations) and made more linear. There is a set order to finding the three treasures. The first two can be done in any order, but the last treasure is always the shield. Many of the character roles were expanded slightly to include more dialogue, and more characters were added. Some of the puzzle solutions were altered and some removed. The changes lead to the distribution of points being different in both games (though both add up to a total of 158). Some item locations were changed; the pebbles for example are found near the river in the original, but near a lake in their remake. Some locations were completely revamped (the stairs in the mountain were replaced with catwalks). The soundtrack was also expanded and included better musical cues when different characters appeared or action ensued.\n\nThe 1990 SCI EGA \"Enhanced\" version of \"King's Quest: Quest for the Crown\" was announced for the Atari ST line of computers and later canceled. It is not known if a beta version exists or how far into development the game was, although it was announced via \"Sierra News Magazine\" in spring 1991. The magazine said owners could send disk #1 or the front cover of the manual along with a check or money order for $20 to upgrade their copy to the enhanced version.\n\nBoth versions of \"King's Quest I\" have been released in assorted collections beginning with the \"King's Quest 15th Anniversary Collector's Edition\" (1994), followed by the \"King's Quest Collection\" (1995), the \"King's Quest Collection Series\" (1996) and \"Roberta Williams Anthology\" (1997). The 2006 collection lacked the original AGI version of \"King's Quest\", and contained only the SCI remake. This version was released on Steam in 2009. The original AGI version appears in the \"KQ1+2+3\" collection released on GOG, but the SCI remake is not included.\n\nIn 2001, the group AGD Interactive (then known as Tierra Entertainment) released an unofficial remake based on Sierra's 1990 version, updating the graphics to use VGA colors, dropping the parser in favor of an interface that mimics that of \"\", and full speech - including the voice of the original voice actor for King Graham in Sierra's official CD-ROM full-speech versions of \"King's Quest V\" and \"VI\", Josh Mandel. This was later updated with original hand-drawn artwork.\n\nThe Master System version of the game was given an average score of 6 out of 10 by reviewers in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" who highlighted its difficulty and its lack of appeal to a number of Sega fans.\n\nThe 1990 enhanced version was described by critics and fans alike at the time as 'destroying a classic', and was compared to the controversial practice of colorizing classic black and white movies. The remake was a critical failure and prevented the release of further remakes in the series.\n\n"}
{"id": "1870597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870597", "title": "King's Quest II", "text": "King's Quest II\n\nKing's Quest II: Romancing the Throne is the second installment in the \"King's Quest\" series of graphic adventure games by Sierra On-Line. It uses the same AGI game engine as \"\" and features King Graham as the player character. The title is a spoof of the 1984 film \"Romancing the Stone\".\n\n\"King's Quest II\" resembles \"King's Quest I\" in appearance and interface. Like in \"King's Quest I\", the game world has 'wrap around' allowing player to travel infinitely in the directions of the north or south. (\"The King's Quest Companion\" which represented a novelized walkthrough explains that the western side of Kolyma folds back upon itself to both the north and south, forever bringing travelers back to where they started.) This was the first \"King's Quest\" to include an introduction cutscene, just past the credits. It also is the first game in the series with a linear story progression. The world actually changes as the story progresses, new characters appear in the world, areas are opened up to the player, and closed off when no longer needed.\n\nPuzzles involve trading these or using these items to receive new items or to get past obstacles, allowing the player to progress. The game in general honors non-violent solutions, offering more points for them. Many puzzles have more than one solution, but only one optimum solution to earn maximum points. Alternate solutions will net less points or in some cases cause the player to lose points. Examples of alternate solutions are taking more violent approach to getting past an obstacle such as killing or stealing. Some choices may lead to dead ends or death.\n\nAll puzzles in the game are solved through a parser. The player may type a phrase with a verb and noun, for example 'Look at' or 'Pick up', the word list in the parser is fairly robust and understands quite a lot of non-important verbs which will result in unexpected replies. For example, the player could type, 'dig', or 'dig the beach' and receive messages about how pointless it is to be digging. Sometimes even illogical verb/noun combinations will net unique comments, such as typing 'Pick up horse' will mention that the flying steed is too fast to catch. With this system the player is able to collect many items using 'pick up' placed into the games inventory. The items in the inventory have close up pictures giving an idea what the item looks like, or in some cases offering clues about the item. In a rare few examples an item may be manipulated in some way.\n\nHaving killed the evil Dahlia and retrieved the three stolen treasures of Daventry, Sir Graham became the new king of Daventry. The mirror shows him a vision about a beautiful young woman, Valanice, in captivity on the top of an ivory crystal tower. Being charmed by her, King Graham travels to the world of Kolyma to rescue Valanice. There he must travel through sea, air, and even death to gain the keys that unlock the three doors to the enchanted island where the witch Hagatha has imprisoned Valanice. After meeting legendary figures such as Neptune, Little Red Riding Hood and Count Dracula, the latter of whom he kills, Graham rescues Valanice. At the end of the game, they are married in a ceremony attended by many of Graham's friends and several of his former enemies.\n\nLimited floppy space would have restricted the design, but Sierra On-Line had been compressing the pictures by drawing them as lines and fill colors for a while. The original version for PC DOS/PCjr does not support sound cards or mice, as they did not exist at the time of publication. That scheme was kept all the way up to \"King's Quest IV\". This sequel to the original \"King's Quest\" provided not just a second look at the life of King (formerly Sir) Graham of Daventry, it also began a tradition of using King's Quest as a training ground for future designers. Future \"Space Quest\" series designers Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe joined the development team. They helped to make the game an even bigger hit than the original.\n\nAccording to the series; main designer and writer, Roberta Williams,\n\n\"King's Quest II\" contains 14 musical selections, including Tchaikovsky's love theme from \"Romeo and Juliet\". Other tracks include Greensleeves on the title screen, Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor in Dracula's castle, and Michael Jackson's Thriller when encountering the ghosts outside the castle entrance (only the opening bars of the last are played so Sierra would not have to pay royalties for using the song). The music for the game was produced by Al Lowe, who was an accomplished jazz musician.\n\nThe game was first released in 1985 on a self-booting disk that supported CGA, PCjr, and Tandy graphic cards (as opposed to \"King's Quest I\", which had separate versions for all three) in 1985 as a disk that booted on start-up. Sierra included several modifications to the AGI engine for compatibility with the IBM AT and EGA cards, which had been introduced since King's Quest I was released. The copy protection used on King's Quest I proved to be incompatible with the AT BIOS, so a different scheme was used. Color palette selection in CGA mode was changed to utilize the BIOS instead of modifying the palette register directly. The game engine was also changed to utilize the PC's timer chip instead of a CPU-based speed loop which would result in the game running too fast on the AT.\n\nIt was rereleased in 1987 with EGA and Hercules support to run under DOS. It was also released on Apple IIGS version with improved soundtrack and sound effects. Sierra's hint book for the game was written by Al Lowe, the game's composer and the creator of the \"Leisure Suit Larry\" series.\n\nThe manual contains a prologue short story by Annette Childs. The story covers Graham being told by the spirit of the former King Edward in the magic mirror that he must find a wife, or suffer the same fate of the kingdom as he had. Graham calls upon his prime minister Gerwain to prepare a great feast, and call all the maidens and ladies throughout the land. None of the ladies interest the king, and he is left solemn. The magic mirror activates telling him about young maiden Valanice trapped in a tower by the evil witch Hagatha. He is told he must travel to land of Kolyma to find the magic doorway that leads to the enchanted realm.\n\nA novelization of the game is included in \"The King's Quest Companion\" which expands the details of story. It was written from the perspective of Daventry's prime minister, Gerwain (mentioned in the \"KQ2\" manual). The first and second editions of the Companion also included articles within \"An Encyclopedia of Daventry (Abridged)\", which gave backstories for various characters and locations from the game. More back history about Kolyma can be found in the chapter, \"The World of Daventry\" in all editions.\n\nVersion history:\n\n\"King's Quest\" received positive reviews upon release, including an almost-perfect score of 39/40 from \"ASM\".\n\nIn 1990 the developers at Sierra redevelop \"King's Quest\" with a new interface and up-to-date technology. The plan was to redevelop \"King's Quest II\" but due to rather disappointing sales of the 1990 remake of \"King's Quest I\", the prospect of officially remaking and re-releasing \"King's Quest II\" was scrapped. \n\nIn 2002, AGD Interactive, then known as Tierra Entertainment, released an unofficial remake of \"King's Quest II\" under a fan license by Vivendi, known as \"\". In 2009, AGD Interactive released version 3.0, featuring redrawn backgrounds and dialogue pictures; the voice-acting was also dramatically improved and, thanks to fan feedback, many problems were attended to.\n\nThe remake uses a point-and-click interface functionally identical to an advanced SCI game engine, VGA graphics and digital sound, including full speech for all characters. Notably for an unofficial, fan-made project, the game's protagonist King Graham is voiced by Josh Mandel, who also voiced the part in Sierra's official CD-ROM full-speech versions of \"King's Quest V\" and \"VI\". In contrast to the group's remake of \"King's Quest I\", a content-wise identical presentation upgrade, \"King's Quest II+\" redesigns the original game by adding a rewritten plot expanding on the 1985 version (although it changes several points of the plot, 'Dracula' is now a good guy, and the 'Monk' is a bad guy, several characters removed), a number of puzzles, new characters and locations including a town, and references to the later \"King's Quest\" games.\n\nThe third chapter of 2015's \"King's Quest\", titled \"Once Upon a Climb\", is a reimagined retelling of the rescue of Valanice from Hagatha's tower from \"King's Quest II\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1870598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870598", "title": "King's Quest III", "text": "King's Quest III\n\nKing's Quest III: To Heir Is Human is the third installment in the \"King's Quest\" series of graphic adventure games developed and released by Sierra On-Line in 1986. The game was originally released for the Apple II and PC DOS, and later ported to several other computer systems. It was the first title game in the series not to feature King Graham as the player character.\n\nMost of the game's various lands and locations appear in the magic map. Once the protagonist Gwydion reaches a new region, he can use the magic map to travel to a previous region.\n\n\"King's Quest III\" was markedly more difficult than its two predecessors. The player was required to type in magic spells line-by-line from a spell book that came with the game. The spells partially served as a form of copy protection, although the game already had disk-based protection.\n\nGwydion's movements are controlled by the player using cursor buttons. In the original release version 1.01 (1986-11-08), using the AGI engine, the escape button pauses the game and there are no menus. Commands are accessed through the F keys, \"Ctrl-\", or manually typing; F1 displays a Help file listing all the commands. It has disk-based copy protection. The version 2.14 (1988-3-15) was included in many of the \"King's Quest\" collections over the years, with the disk based self-booting copy-protection removed. Pushing escape brings up a menu (arrow keys can be used to choose options), and the speed controls are included in the menu.\n\nIn \"King's Quest III\", the story moves away from Daventry and King Graham to the land of Llewdor, where a boy named Gwydion is being kept by the wicked wizard Manannan. According to the introduction, for as long as he could remember, 17-year-old Gwydion has been held captive by Manannan as his servant, cooking and cleaning for him in his home atop a large mountain in Llewdor. From this vantage point, and with the help of a telescope, the seemingly all-knowing wizard watches the countryside, the shoreline and vast ocean to the east and an endless desert to the west.\n\nManannan takes a series of absences and Gwydion seizes his chance to escape. He breaks into the wizard's laboratory and reads Manannan's book of spells, then goes out into Llewdor to collect ingredients for them. After solving many puzzles to obtain the spell ingredients, Gwydion turns Manannan into a cat and is free. He also learns from an oracle that he is in fact the long-lost prince of Daventry, Prince Alexander, and that his sister Princess Rosella is going to be sacrificed to a horrible three-headed dragon that has been besieging the kingdom.\n\nAfter defeating Manannan, Alexander attempts to buy passage on a ship, but is instead captured by pirates. After sailing to the coast of Daventry, he manages to use another spell to put the pirates to sleep and escape, stealing their treasure in the process. Alexander traverses a series of mountains before finally reaching the outskirts of Daventry where he discovers Rosella about to be slain by the dragon. Using one of Manannan's spells, Alexander creates a thunderstorm and kills the dragon with lightning strikes. Alexander rescues his sister and the two return to Daventry where they are joyously reunited with the king and queen. The Magic Mirror, which has been clouded by a mystical darkness since the night Prince Alexander was kidnapped, is restored and King Graham decides to pass on his adventurer's cap to his children. As the game ends, King Graham tosses the cap to Alexander and Rosella who reach out to catch it.\n\nThe game's title is a pun on the proverb \"\" by Alexander Pope, whose namesake may have been given to the character Gwydion once it is later revealed who he really is in the game. The actions taken by Gwydion in this story lead directly to the events that begin \"King's Quest IV\".\n\n\n\"King's Quest III\" was the biggest and most ambitious game Sierra had made up to that point. The series' designer and writer Roberta Williams said, \"My previous games, from \"Mystery House\" to \"King's Quest II\", were all great. But they were essentially glorified treasure hunts... your object being to win the game by finding and collecting items. It was not possible to have bigger and more complex plots than that thanks to technical limitations.\" By the mid-1980s, the new generation computer platforms such as the IBM AT, Amiga, and Macintosh were faster and sported more memory as well as standard hard disks. Thus, it was now possible to develop games of greater complexity than had been possible on 8-bit machines.\n\nRoberta Williams collaborated with a team consisting mainly of the same people that worked with her on the previous two games, but more people were involved in the production this time. Al Lowe, who made the music in \"King's Quest II\", became the lead programmer of \"King's Quest III\", while his wife Margaret made the music instead. This was the game on which Al Lowe cut his teeth before moving onto his own series, \"Leisure Suit Larry\". Williams said, \"Rosella was introduced toward the end of the game; seeing her on the screen for the first time, I suddenly saw her on her own adventures in a sequel.\"\n\n\"King's Quest III\" was the first adventure game featuring auto-mapping, with a \"magic map\" found in the game that can be used to teleport to most locations that the player has visited before. This feature was unpopular among some fans who claim it made the game too easy. Hence, magic maps in future Sierra On-line games were more limited in their teleporting ability; they were never used in future \"King's Quest\" games, but were later re-introduced in \"Mixed-Up Mother Goose\". The developers also introduced a real-time clock, with actions based on the clock. The game was released on five 5.25\" floppy disks and three 3.5\" disks, as Sierra's second largest game after \"Time Zone\" (six disks). It was almost 50% larger than \"King's Quest I\" or \"King's Quest II\". \"KQ3\" had 104 screens, whereas the first \"KQ\" had about 80 and \"KQII\" had about 92.\n\n\"King's Quest III\" was the first Sierra game to be DOS-based instead of using a self-booting disk, as well as the first to feature EGA and Hercules graphics support. A year later, it was rereleased with the slightly improved AGI V3 engine. The Apple IIGS version had improved music and sound effects.\n\nThe game's manual contains a short prologue story by Annette Childs that tells of Manannan's previous slaves and their deaths. The book also contains spells from The Sorcery of Old, needed to cast the spells in the game (these are reprinted in \"The King's Quest Companion\").\n\n\"King's Quest III\" was the first game in which Sierra used a manual-based copy protection scheme (although technically not intended to be copy protection). Nearly all AGI games (including \"King's Quest III\") have a disk-based copy protection, requiring the original game disk to be present in order to play the game. This was not entirely effective and unofficial versions were widespread. (This key-disk check was removed from the later-released \"King's Quest Collection\" versions.) However, to complete \"King's Quest III\", the player needs to create a number of magic spells through alchemical formulas that are only available in the game's manual. Many considered the process slightly overdone; 140 of the 210 possible points in the game are obtained through simply doing what the manual says, leaving less room for real puzzles. Starting with \"King's Quest IV\", later Sierra games would instead ask for but a few actions described in the manual. Most often it was a dialog window appearing once, requesting the player to enter word X from page Y of the manual. This was not a true form of copy protection and was actually considered a game feature (as most puzzles in the game are based on the spells), and thus the complete spell list was reprinted in many of the official guides at the time, including the \"Official Book of King's Quest: Coventry and Beyond\" and \"The King's Quest Companion\".\n\nA novelization of the game is included in \"The King's Quest Companion\". The novelization is written in the form of an interview between Derek Karlavaegen (\"Guidebook to the Land of the Green Isles\") and Alexander sometime after the events of the third game. This was written to be a novel-style walkthrough used to solve the game. The \"Encyclopedia of Daventry\" in the first and second edition offered a few more backstories and details about the various characters and objects from the game. The chapter \"The World of Daventry\" also included more details about the Land of Llewdor, and its inhabitants. The book also contains copies of the spells from The Sorcerery of Old, needed to beat the game.\n\n\"King's Quest III\" sold 250,000 copies by February 1993. According to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of the \"King's Quest\" series surpassed 3.8 million units by the end of March 1996.\n\nThough for the most part well received, winning the Softsel Hot List Hottest Product Award in 1987, the release of this product in 1986 was quickly met with loud protests from gamers claiming that \"King's Quest III\" was not really a \"King's Quest\". Because it focused on a young slave named Gwydion and his attempts to escape his evil master, players did not grasp the connection between Gwydion and King Graham of Daventry until they finished the game some months later.\n\nA review in \"Computer Gaming World\" described the game as exceedingly frustrating, from the task of climbing stairs to identifying objects from their low-resolution graphics. The hint guide was highly recommended as a way to alleviate some of that frustration. The reviewer suggested gamers new to the series play \"King's Quest I\" instead, it being much easier.\n\nThe \"automatic mapping feature\" was widely promoted with \"King's Quest III\"; however, it was not included in later \"King's Quest\" games as player feedback indicated it reduced challenge. According to Roberta Williams, \"\"KQ3\" was very dark, and it utilized lots of magic and magic spells with the basic idea of finding ingredients for 'black magic' spells and then casting those spells. Certain religious groups were upset with me over that one!\"\n\nIn August 2016, \"King's Quest III\" placed 50th on Time's The 50 Best Video Games of All Time list.\n\nThere have been two unofficial fan remakes. Infamous Adventures created a remake, in 2006. It is a slightly expanded remake offering new material, including new cutscenes, a few new characters, expanded narration or dialogue, full speech, new or modified locations, and easter eggs. Most of the original puzzles remain intact, although the spell system was streamlined. The game was made by the team because they wanted to see if they could do it, and prove they had the drive and ability to recreate the game with updated graphics and sounds. AGD Interactive released another remake, \"King's Quest III Redux\", in 2011.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1870601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870601", "title": "King's Quest IV", "text": "King's Quest IV\n\nKing's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella is a graphic adventure game developed and released by Sierra On-Line for the MS-DOS, Amiga, Apple II, Apple IIGS, and Atari ST computers in 1988. The player takes on the role of Princess Rosella, daughter of King Graham of Daventry (\"King's Quest I\" and \"King's Quest II\") and the twin sister of Gwydion/Alexander (\"King's Quest III\"), who must save her father and a good fairy and destroy an evil witch. Critically acclaimed, it was one of the first PC games to support a sound card.\n\n\"King's Quest IV\" uses the Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) and Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) systems. This is the only chapter in the \"King's Quest\" series where the action takes place in real-time and within the allotted time limit, as the events of the game cover about 24 hours. Some activities must be completed during the day, while other puzzles can be solved only at night (the nightfall in the game happens either at 9 pm or at a certain point in the plot). The overall high difficulty of \"King's Quest III\" was toned down in \"King's Quest IV\".\n\nPicking up immediately where \"King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human\" left off, as King Graham tosses his children his adventure's cap, he suffers a massive heart attack and is left on his death bed. The devastated Princess Rosella is contacted via the Magic Mirror by the good fairy Genesta in the faraway land of Tamir who reveals the existence of a magic fruit that can heal King Graham in exchange for Rosella helping Genesta. Rosella agrees and is teleported to the fairy kingdom of Tamir. The realm's ruler, Queen Genesta, reveals that her archenemy, the evil fairy Lolotte, has stolen her talisman without which Genesta will die in twenty-four hours. Additionally, without the talisman, Genesta lacks the power to return Rosella to Daventry. Rosella agrees to undertake a quest for both the talisman and the magic fruit and goes out undercover, dressed as a peasant girl.\n\nRosella manages to find the fruit, traversing a dangerous underground passage and swamp, but is captured in Queen Lolotte's perilous mountains and imprisoned in her castle. The witch demands that Rosella undertake three tasks for her in order for Rosella to earn her freedom and a big reward. Rosella reluctantly agrees and captures a unicorn, steals the golden hen and recovers Pandora's Box for Lolotte who intends to use the items to increase her evil power and influence. Lolotte reveals that her hideous and deformed son Edgar has fallen in love with Rosella and she intends for them to marry, trapping Rosella and condemning King Graham and Genesta to death. However, a sympathetic Edgar helps Rosella escape and she slays Lolotte with Cupid's bow. Rosella recovers the talisman, the hen and Pandora's Box and rescues the unicorn. In order to keep Pandora's Box from being used for evil again, Rosella returns it to its tomb and seals the entrance so no one else can ever enter.\n\nRosella returns the talisman and the hen to Genesta, saving her life. As a reward for his help and kindness, Genesta transforms Edgar into a handsome young man, but Rosella rejects Edgar's marriage proposal though she expresses hope that they will meet again someday. Rosella is teleported back to Daventry where the fruit heals King Graham to the joy of his family.\n\nAlthough Rosella's primary quest is to retrieve the magic fruit needed to save King Graham, it is possible to return to Daventry without completing this task, but this leads to a tragic alternate ending to the game where Rosella returns to Daventry in time to witness her father passing away instead of saving his life. A second alternate ending exists where if Rosella is caught after escaping from her room, she will be forced to marry Edgar and spend the rest of her life in Tamir. Winning the game will not resolve all storylines, although that will be the goal in the sequels.\n\nWith the SCI engine, Sierra dropped disk-based copy protection schemes in favor of requiring the user to enter a word from the manual, as the new-generation games were designed primarily to be installed and run from a hard disk. \"King's Quest IV\" was the first commercially released game for IBM PC compatibles to support sound cards instead of only the standard built-in speaker. In addition to the familiar PC speaker and Tandy sound, it could utilize AdLib , Disney Sound Source, IBM Music Feature Card, or Roland boards. The new SCI engine allowed the game's designers to incorporate an orchestrated musical score along with more complex sound effects, a previously unattainable feat. To ensure an immersive soundtrack, composer William Goldstein was hired to write the game's musical score, totaling over 75 short music pieces.\n\nThe series' author Roberta Williams wrote in the notes to the \"King's Quest Collection Series\", \"Before \"King's Quest IV\" was released, word leaked out that Graham would have a heart attack and might die. Fans were upset enough to write in, asking to save Graham. I wanted \"King's Quest IV\" to have some pressure applied to you: a timed game, taking place over a 24-hour period, so you roam around during the day and eventually it turns to night. I don't remember other games using the same scenes at night; it looked creepy.\" With a female protagonist and more colorful graphics than in her earlier games, she attempted to appeal more specifically to female demographics. As the game's aspect that satisfied her most, she said: \"I like the heroine, Rosella. I guess because she's a part of me that's coming out. I really identified with her. Sometimes she's delicate, but she's strong, knows what she wants, she's not afraid to do what she has to do. She's courageous. It was fun for me to do a female character.\"\n\nThe game was simultaneously produced and published in the AGI and SCI engines. The AGI engine was used in all earlier Sierra adventure games, the SCI in all later ones. SCI supported higher-resolution graphics (320×200 resolution versus 160×200), more sophisticated animation, mouse, and sound card support. Some older features like CGA composite mode and PCjr support were removed. Memory requirements for SCI games were thus double those of AGI games (512 kB vs 256k). The new engine was designed for then-current IBM-compatible hardware (i.e. 8–16 MHz 286 or 386 machines with EGA or VGA graphics and a hard disk) and ran poorly on older 8086 computers. The game was previewed at the Consumer Electronics Show on June 4, 1988.\n\n\"King's Quest IV\" was the only native-mode SCI game to also have an AGI version (some games originally made with the AGI engine like the original \"\" were released in updated SCI versions). This was done mostly as a fall-back measure because the SCI engine was new and unproven, and also for the large existing user base of 8086 machines. However, only a quite small number of copies were sold. It was discontinued within a few months of the game's August 1988 release. The two games are identical in gameplay, except that the SCI version was updated with some additional parser responses. The AGI version 2.0 contains the \"beam me\" Easter egg, which transported Rosella to a \"Star Trek\"-esque room with all of the development team present (this Easter egg is not present in any SCI version). A version identical to the AGI version was released on the Apple IIGS with improved music and effects (over the MS-DOS AGI counterpart); the IIGS port does not use the SCI engine for performance reasons.\n\n\"King's Quest IV\" sold 100,000 copies in its first two weeks. According to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of the \"King's Quest\" series surpassed 3.8 million units by the end of March 1996. By November 2000, PC Data reported that \"King's Quest IV\"s sales in the United States alone had reached between 300,000 and 400,000 units. GameSpot's staff wrote that the game \"marked a dramatic increase in the series' commercial success\".\n\n\"King's Quest IV\" was very well received by the trade press, including being awarded review scores of 309/400 from \"ACE\", 79% from \"Amiga Action\", 81% from \"Amiga Computing\", 85% from \"Commodore User\", 91% from \"Computer & Video Games\", 85% from \"CU Amiga\", 9/10 from \"Datormagazin\", 90% from \"The Games Machine (Italia)\", 13/15 from \"Tilt\", and 79% from \"Zzap!\". It was also selected as \"Best Adventure Game of 1988\" by the Software Publishers Association.\n\nScorpia of \"Computer Gaming World\" reviewed \"King's Quest IV\", noting the beautiful graphics, but also mentioning the game ran slowly if the screen contained animations. She described the game's puzzles as \"uneven\", but considered the presentation as cinematic in quality. David Stanton of \"Compute!\" praised the graphics and sound of the IBM PC version, including its support of VGA and sound cards such as AdLib and Roland MT-32, and concluded that \"\"King's Quest IV\" sets a gaming standard others will be hard-pressed to match, much less surpass,\" describing the game's soundtrack as \"40 minutes of the best sound available on any computer disk anywhere.\" \"Page 6\"s John Sweeney wrote the game was \"undoubtedly excellent\", but personally he preferred \"King's Quest III\".\n\nIn 2009, \"Atomic\" named \"King's Quest IV\" one of the \"50 Games to Play Before You Die\". The magazine's Ben Hardwidge called it \"a classic\". IGN's Kosta Andreadis wrote in 2014, \"\"The Perils of Rosella\" stands the test of time despite its shortcomings (and you can buy it on GOG.com), for above all providing a memorable and at times thrilling adventure, on top of being one of the first games to ever feature both a female protagonist as well as sound card support.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1870602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870602", "title": "Chinese Brazilians", "text": "Chinese Brazilians\n\nChinese Brazilians ( or \"Chinês-brasileiro\"; ) are people of Chinese ancestry who were born in or have immigrated to Brazil. The Chinese Brazilian population was estimated to be approximately 250,000 in 2007.\n\nThe first Chinese people came to Brazil in 1814, when Chinese tea planters were sent from Portugal to the Royal Botanical Garden in Rio de Janeiro. Following calls for the abolition of slavery, more Afro-Brazilian slaves stopped working on plantations, so the Brazilian government was looking for a replacement for the labor force lost in the middle of the 19th century. After considering immigrants such as the Europeans, the Brazilian government decided to hire Chinese laborers, as they were more willing to take the hard task than the Europeans did. The Brazilian government started to import some Chinese laborers from Canton, California and other Latin American countries in the 1870s. Continuing the commercial contract with the Chinese government, the Brazilian government imported more Chinese laborers to Brazil in the 1880 and 1881. The earliest group of Chinese laborers started migration to Brazil, and solved the temporary labor loss in Brazil in the late 19th century.\n\nSão Paulo now has the largest Chinese Brazilian population, in particular in the district of Liberdade. The majority of the Chinese immigrants settle in São Paulo, which 200,000 out of 350,000 Chinese Brazilians in total. Some Chinese immigrants work as merchants for international trade, and they work as lawyers, member of the parliament and the house of representatives and doctors. Chinese immigrants have integrated into the Brazilian society by building inter-cultural exchange in the communities. Besides being an area famous for its strong Japanese presence, a significant number of Taiwanese immigrants out of 70,000 in total, have settled in Liberdade, and many Chinese immigrants have come to Liberdade following the Communist revolution in 1949. Many Cantonese from Hong Kong and Portuguese-speaking Macau, including some Macanese of mixed Chinese and Portuguese descent, have also settled in Brazil. These Macau immigrants can usually speak and understand Portuguese (its Creole, Macanese or Patuá, is also spoken), allowing them to adjust more easily to life in Brazil. Today, the majority of Chinese Brazilians only speak Portuguese, although some may be bilingual, speaking Portuguese and Chinese.\n\nIt is known that there were Chinese in Brazil as far back as the late 18th century; Rugendas painted a depiction of Chinese Tea planters in Rio de Janeiro during the period of the Portuguese Royal family in Brazil. In 1814 John VI of Portugal brought 300 Chinese from Macau to work in the Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nChinese people started moving to Brazil in the late 19th century when Brazil called for abolishing slavery. As a result, the number of Afro-Brazilians slaves decreased gradually, which created labor shortages. To solve the problem, the Brazilians came up with a plan of having immigrants to the country to replace the slaves. While considering having other European immigrants to replace the labor shortage, some Brazilians knew that the Europeans took longer time to adapt to Brazil before working, whereas the Chinese were able to easily adapt to the working conditions. Moreover, European immigrants were less willing to work in the field under harsh conditions (and receiving meager remuneration) while Chinese laborers were accustomed to the low pay, “lived with less comfort than all other peoples,” and “more temperate.” Plantation jobs were a kind of low pay job, and hiring more Chinese with a very low wage could also cut down the cost of labor. Many Brazilian planters and the Brazilian government believed that Chinese were “the only colonists capable of enduring the hardships and the thousand privations peculiar to [Brazilian] rural labor.” Some Brazilians claimed that “only [Chinese] workers who could save Brazilian agriculture.”\n\nTherefore, the Brazilian government planned to import Chinese laborers, just like other tropical nations which had done the same since the 1840s. However, as China had known that the Chinese laborers had received harsh labor treatments in countries like Cuba and Peru, China had prohibited all other forms of immigration but the voluntary ones, and allowed importation of laborers only to countries with commercial treaties. Despite the barriers set by the Chinese government, Brazilian companies still managed to have 1,000 Chinese to work as tea planters in 1874. In 1875, the Brazilian companies tried to bring in more Chinese workers to Brazil by recruiting those in the province of Guangdong (Canton) and California. To legally import more Chinese laborers, the Brazilian government negotiated a commercial treaty with China, but China signed the commercial treaty with reluctance in Tianjin, China on September 5, 1880 with a revised contract on October 3, 1881. With the low cost of transportation that is 35 milreis per passenger, which is less than 20 U.S dollars, the new Brazilian companies tried to seek more laborers from China by connecting with the director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company called Tong King Sing. By building up a friendly trade relationship with the Tong, Brazil was able to import more Chinese laborers, however the workers were bound to a five-year contract. Despite the immediate transportation of more Chinese laborers from China to Brazil, the Chinese government continued displaying a hesitant attitude in the 1890s. Hence, the Brazilian government looked to other alternative sources of Asian labor and the Japanese became the new target.\n\nHaving Chinese immigrants work in coffee and tea plantations raised controversies in Brazil while the Brazilian government sought to solve the problem of labor shortage as a result of a call to end slavery. Brazil was seeking modernity starting in the late 19th century, and their core value for progress was racial \"whitening\", while having an increased non-white population was thought to lead to a degeneration of society. Some Brazilians were against Chinese immigration because of perceived cultural and racial inferiority to the Europeans, based on the Social Darwinism. There was a theory about the ultimate disappearance of Chinese in the Brazilian society. Some Brazilians were also afraid of Chinese domination in Brazil after immigration as Chinese would take over the places with exotic cultures, opium, pigtails and pagan religions. Unlike the Indians and Africans who had been Christianized, many Chinese immigrants had difficulty integrating into society as they strongly held on to traditional Chinese beliefs. Some Brazilians also feared that the Chinese would not leave Brazil once they had settled down, and would congregate in certain areas and create businesse monopolies, leading to competition with domestic workers. Amidst it all, there were still some Brazilians who were pro-Chinese immigration. The Republican leader Quintino Bocayuva wrote pamphlets to defend the notion that having Chinese laborers would benefit Brazil in 1868. It was advertised in the pamphlet A crise da lavoura, outlining reasons such as that the Chinese were skilled at agricultural work, and some negative aspects of Chinese would not hurt Brazil because they were passionate about gambling, emigrated alone, inward looking and would ultimately return to China after saving up enough.\n\nSome Chinese laborers were unhappy with their work, hence they fled to Rio de Janeiro. Some Chinese laborers attained free status, and made a living through selling street foods and merchandise in the late 19th century. In the middle of the 20th century, more Chinese who lived in the US and Africa started moving to Brazil as a result of wars and persecutions, while some Chinese who lived in Hong Kong and Taiwan also chose Brazil as their new settlement. Another wave of immigration took place as well in the late 1970s when Chinese immigrants from the provinces Guangdong and Zhejiang, and from the cities of Shanghai and Beijing settled in Brazil. Even though these new immigrants possessed different levels of literacy, some literate ones worked as merchants, lawyers, doctors and government officials.\n\nChinese Brazilians who moved to Brazil in the early years struggled immensely, as they had borrowed money from relatives for subsidies in order to start small businesses. For example, some sold Cantonese snacks like Yau Gok (Gok ai). While other Brazilians worked only eight hours a day, the Chinese immigrants worked for more than twelve hours a day. With intelligence, persistence and diligence, Chinese Brazilians started to succeed in different forms of small and big businesses. Some of the older generation with higher literacy were actively involved in the mainstream Brazilian community, as they worked as members of the house of representatives and parliament, lawyers and doctors. For the past 25 years, more Chinese have been traveling to Brazil for international trade.\n\nThere are currently a total of around 300,000 Chinese immigrants in Brazil. About 200,000 of them reside in São Paulo, São Paulo.\n\nChinese merchants started to expand their business after immigration, but some negative influences hindered the growth. For instance, in 2007, the Brazilian judicial system had settled down the largest shopping center and 50 stores in São Paulo, and arrested six merchants. Even though there were illegal operations and smuggling among the Chinese immigrants, it was not the majority.\n\n25 de Março street in São Paulo is a place with 2.5 km in length (approximately 1.55 miles) where the majority Chinese Brazilians mainly sell their merchandises to make a living. There are more than 3,000 Chinese Brazilians run the stores out of 4,000 shops in total, and the expansion took place in less than 30 years. Working in 25 de Março street is not easy for the Chinese Brazilians as some of them started with no Portuguese language background, and they were struggling to communicate with other Brazilians except other Chinese. Some shop owners sought for business opportunities that they would not have back in homeland with children and parents left behind. The 25 de Março street was not the safest area in São Paulo and some Chinese immigrants were robbed when they started business in Brazil.\n\nThe Brazilian House of Representatives and the city of São Paulo Parliament passed the proposal of setting August 15 as \"Chinese Immigrants Day.\" From the mid-19th century, Chinese migrated to Brazil for tea and coffee plantation in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which Brazil has become one of the earliest countries in the world with the knowledge of tea planting. Chinese has been a group of immigrants in Brazil striving to integrate into the Brazilian society, promoting China and Brazil’s international trade, and intercultural communication.\n\nAs more Chinese migrated to Brazil and worked hard, Chinese immigrants has gained higher recognition in the Brazilian society while China is becoming one of the most powerful world economic power, which Brazil has established international trade with. Under the fact that São Paulo is the most populated city in Brazil, the Chinese Brazilians in the community hosted cultural events like acupuncture demo, cheongsam, dragon dancing and Chinese art, which attracted different ethnic groups to watch and improved inter-cultural communications. The Chinese Brazilians has gained high recognition and respect in the communities. This has occurred because the Chinese community donated money local to charities by doing this they are contributing to the community actively. Despite the social recognition and China-Brazil diplomatic relationship, some robberies still take place. Chinese Brazilians in São Paulo collaborated with the local police to discuss solutions to the problems.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1870604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870604", "title": "King's Quest V", "text": "King's Quest V\n\nKing's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder! (also known simply as King's Quest V) is a 1990 graphic adventure game by Sierra On-Line. Originally released in November 1990, it featured a significant improvement in graphics (achieved through the introduction of VGA into the series). It was also the first \"King's Quest\" installment to replace the typing user interface with a point-and-click user interface. The title is a spoof on the proverb \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\"\n\n\"King's Quest V\" sold over half million copies and won several awards. It was later released as a fully voiced \"talkie\" CD-ROM, done by members of the Sierra staff. By summer a Sega CD port of the game was announced, but was never released.\n\nIn the introduction to the game, a view of Castle Daventry is shown, when suddenly, a mysterious cloaked figure appears. He enchants the castle, causing a whirlwind to appear, which soon engulfs the castle and lifts it out of sight. Because he is out walking when this happens, King Graham is the only member of the royal family to be left behind. He returns to the castle to find that it has disappeared, and is soon confronted by a talking owl named Cedric.\n\nCedric witnessed the cloaked figure's attack, and tells Graham that it was a powerful, evil wizard named Mordack who stole the castle. Cedric then brings Graham to the land of Serenia, where his master Crispin resides. Crispin is also a wizard, but a good one, who gives Graham some advice, his old wand, and a piece of white snake which allows Graham to speak with animals. Graham then starts on his journey.\n\nLater, Graham learns that Mordack is the brother of the wizard Manannan, whom Graham's son, Prince Alexander, turned into a cat in \"King's Quest III\". Mordack has imprisoned the castle and royal family of Daventry out of revenge, and threatens to feed the royal family to Manannan unless Prince Alexander agrees to restore him to his true form as the spell's nature means that only Prince Alexander as the caster can reverse it. King Graham travels through the land of Serenia, gathering helpful items and information, and eventually makes his way to Mordack's island, and to his castle lair, to save his family from their impending doom.\n\nThe owl Cedric accompanies the protagonist King Graham through the entire game to provide commentary and advice. He has to be rescued from danger at several points. The only useful thing the owl does is inadvertently saving Graham's life from a spell near the end of the game.\n\nAt the end of the game, with the help of another of Mordack's prisoners, Princess Cassima, Graham is able to confront Mordack in a magical duel, using spells he learns from Mordack's own spell book against him. After Mordack transforms himself into a ring of fire, Graham slays the evil wizard by conjuring a rain storm to put the fire out. The good wizard Crispin arrives soon after and transforms the castle and royal family back to normal. At Graham's request, Crispin teleports Cassima back to her home in the Land of the Green Isles and sends the royal family back to Daventry.\n\nThough still largely standalone, \"King's Quest V\" is one of the few where the elements of the plot itself are directly connected to events or individuals in both previous and future games. The location the game is set in, Serenia, was first visited in the earlier game \"Wizard and the Princess\". During the game, King Graham discovers the skeleton of a man in the Serenia desert which is identified as the body of the Wanderer, the protagonist from \"Wizard and the Princess\" in the King's Quest Companion. The transformation of Manannan into a cat is a necessary task to completing \"King's Quest III\". And this act has profound consequences for Alexander (and his family), as it is the impetus for the \"KQV\" storyline.\n\nThe game's ending ties into its sequel, \"King's Quest VI\". Cassima was introduced as a slave to the wizard Mordack. Before she is sent home at the end, Alexander mentions wanting to visit her in the Land of the Green Isles, which happens at the beginning of \"KQVI\". And Cassima mentions her Vizier, who first introduced Mordack to her. In \"KQVI\", we find out that Mordack and the Vizier (who is the primary antagonist of \"KQVI\") are both part of an organization known as the Society of the Black Cloak (technically only the Vizier is confirmed to be a member, but members of the organization know of Mordack). Even the music for Cassima in Mordack's castle is enhanced and used for the love theme for Alexander and Cassima. At the end of that game, the Vizier is defeated by Alexander and Cassima and the two marry.\n\n\"King's Quest V\" was the last in the series to feature EGA and Tandy graphics at 320×200: a separate EGA release contained 16-color 320×200 versions of the graphics, whereas the VGA release featured 320×200 256-color VGA graphics (and, unlike later SCI games, did not support rendering these into 16 colors at 640×200 resolution on EGA cards).\n\nThe diskette version (EGA and VGA) requires Graham to cast spells throughout the game, requiring the user to refer to the manual as a form of copy protection. This was omitted in the CD-ROM version. The disk version has a slightly different game interface, similar to the version later used in the NES version, the main difference being that there is an additional walk option. Several of the animated characters including the rat, the ant, and the bee, have large closeup pictures of their upper torsos, that are fully animated, including arms and, for the insects, antennae. The ant, for example, even raises up the golden needle. These closeups and animations were modified or mostly cut from the CD-ROM version (which only shows closeups on the characters' faces).\n\nReleased in 1992, the CD-ROM version is mastered in the High Sierra Format, unrelated to the publisher's name. This version added voice acting. There are also many script differences between the floppy and CD-ROM versions. Many of the narrative descriptions were modified, and lines were added to characters that did not have speaking roles. For example, the snake and some of the villagers are given a few quotes, whereas they did not speak at all, and ignored Graham in the floppy version. Many of the characters have close up pictures (taken from the floppy) that were given various colored backgrounds behind them, and a frame around them (though the frame cuts off some details). The snake is even given a close up picture for its new speaking parts and a few of the characters are given more lines.\n\nIn order to make the Nintendo Entertainment System adaptation more family-friendly and release it to stores everywhere, Nintendo of America had to follow its Video Game Content Guidelines requiring it to tone down violence, nudity, language, and religious themes in the games it released and it was published by Konami, rather than Sierra On-Line. One example is Graham's water-drinking scene in the desert: where the narrator's words say, \"Ah, life-giving water. Nectar of the Gods. Graham can now feel strength and renewal flowing through him\" in the PC version, in the NES adaptation it says, \"Ah! The cool water felt wonderful on Graham's parched lips and his body now feels rejuvenated.\" This was edited due to religious themes. Another example has Queen Icebella ordering the wolves to take Graham and Cedric to the dungeons for ever, instead of actually killing them. Cedric is turned to 'stone', rather than Mordack actually killing him. In the Konami release, this obviously was to censor out the threatened violence, but the threatened violence was shown in the Sierra On-Line release.\n\nAn Atari ST version was announced via Sierra Online's magazine: Sierra News Magazine for a Spring 1991 release but was later canceled. Sierra's Srini Vasan and Sierra UK fought for continued Atari ST development but Sierra Online discontinued Atari ST support entirely shortly afterwards.\n\n\"King's Quest V\" sold 250,000 copies by February 1993, and sales ultimately surpassed 500,000 copies. According to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of the \"King's Quest\" series surpassed 3.8 million units by the end of March 1996. By November 2000, PC Data reported that \"King's Quest V\"s sales in the United States alone had reached between 300,000 and 400,000 units.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\"s Scorpia in 1991 praised the \"tour de force\" VGA graphics, sound card audio, non-typing parser and user interface, but criticized the gigantic, yet almost pointless, desert map. She concluded that the game was best for new adventurers because of its easy puzzles, and a \"pleasant diversion\" for more-experienced players. In 1991, \"Dragon\" gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nIn April 1993 \"Computer Gaming World\"s Charles Ardai called the voice acting in the CD-ROM version of the game \"wooden\". In April 1994 the magazine said that \"the quality of the voice acting covers the gamut from excellent to mediocre and, in some cases, can grate on the nerves\", but the CD version was still preferable because \"other enhancements are excellent\". In 2007, Adventure Gamers gave the game a three out of five stars. Allgame also gave the PC original four out of five stars, while giving its NES adaptation two-and-a-half stars.\n\n\"King's Quest V\" won the 1991 Software Publishers Association Excellence in Software Award for Best Fantasy Role-Playing/Adventure Program, \"Computer Gaming World\" named the game as its 1991 Adventure Game of the Year, and in 1992 named it to the magazine's Hall of Fame for games readers rated highly over time. In 1992 \"King's Quest V\" was voted \"Best Multimedia Fantasy/Adventure Game\" by readers of \"MPC World\". In 1996 \"Computer Gaming World\" named \"King's Quest V\" the 94th best game ever. The editors wrote that \"Roberta Williams horrified Sierra traditionalists by getting the parser out of the way of some of the most beautiful graphics ever.\n\nSierra displayed their acknowledgement at the criticisms of \"King's Quest V\" through references to the game in several of their releases:\n\n\"King's Quest V\" also inspired a text-based remake, \"\", and also another parody fan-game \"\" starring Cedric which pokes fun of many of the situations and mannerisms of Cedric.\n\n"}
{"id": "1870607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870607", "title": "King's Quest VI", "text": "King's Quest VI\n\nKing's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is a point-and-click adventure game, first released in 1992 as the sixth installment in the \"King's Quest\" series produced by Sierra On-Line. Written by Roberta Williams and Jane Jensen, \"King's Quest VI\" is widely recognized as the high point in the series for its landmark 3D graphic introduction movie (created by Kronos Digital Entertainment) and professional voice acting (Hollywood actor Robby Benson provided the voice for Prince Alexander, the game's protagonist). \"King's Quest VI\" was programmed in Sierra's Creative Interpreter and was the last \"King's Quest\" game to be released on floppy disk. A CD-ROM version of the game was released in 1993, including more character voices, a slightly different opening movie and more detailed artwork and animation.\n\nThe name of this sequel is a pun on the common phrase \"here today, gone tomorrow\". This pun is related to the abrupt departure of Prince Alexander after the events of \"King's Quest V\", where he was just rescued by King Graham along with Princess Cassima, who asked Alexander to come visit her at the end of that game. \"\" also contained the word \"heir\" in its title and also featured Prince Alexander (then known as the slave Gwydion) as the main character.\n\n\"King's Quest VI\" is a 2D graphic adventure game with a point-and-click interface. The player is given an icon-based toolbar at the top of the screen of selectable functions: walk, look (provides a description from the narrator of the object targeted), action and talk, respectively. It also includes the item inventory (the last selected item can be picked right away) and a game options menu. This is the second game in the series to feature this interface, which was introduced in its immediate predecessor \"King's Quest V\" as a new feature of the SCI1 version of Sierra's Creative Interpreter engine; previous titles in the series featured a text parser where players had to type commands and actions instead of selecting them on the screen.\n\nGameplay involves solving puzzles. Those include logic puzzles and interacting with characters either by dialogue or usage of collected items. One of the puzzles requires consulting the booklet \"Guidebook to the Land of the Green Isles\", which is included in the game's package. Aside from providing additional background to the game's setting, this booklet serves as part of the game's copy-protection. The player will not be able to pass the puzzles on the Cliffs of Logic that guard the Isle of the Sacred Mountain without information from the booklet. The booklet also includes a poem encoding the solution to one of the puzzles in the labyrinth on the island. In the re-released edition, the guide is part of the manual released on the game CD.\n\nSolving the puzzles in the game usually requires traveling between the islands that make up the game world, which is accomplished by means of a magic map. Although a magic map had been used in earlier games of the series such as \"King's Quest III\", its implementation in \"King's Quest VI\" was different from earlier games in that it was only used for travel between islands, which could not be reached using the walking interface.\n\nThe game takes place almost entirely in a fictional kingdom called the Land of the Green Isles. The kingdom comprises several islands, and is described as being largely isolated from the outside world. The player can travel between different islands after obtaining a magic map.\n\nThe center of the kingdom is the Isle of the Crown, which has an Arabian Nights theme. The Isle of Wonder is inspired by Alice in Wonderland, and the Isle of the Sacred Mountain is inspired by Classical mythology. The Isle of the Beast, inspired by Beauty And The Beast, is heavily forested and scattered with magical barriers. There also are additional hidden areas. One of these is inhabited by a tribe of druids, while another gives the player the option to confront Death.\n\nThe game's opening cutscene shows Prince Alexander haunted by his memories of Princess Cassima, whom he met at the end of \"King's Quest V\" when they were both rescued from the wizard Mordack. After seeing a vision of Cassima in the magical mirror that his father acquired in the first \"King's Quest\", he sails to find her. At the beginning of the game he is shipwrecked on the shore of the Isle of the Crown, where he learns that the vizier Abdul Alhazred (named after the author of the fictional Necronomicon) has assumed control in Cassima's absence, and plans to force her to marry him. Alexander must explore the Land of the Green Isles in order to find and learn what he needs to rescue Cassima from the vizier.\n\nA significant aspect of \"KQ6\" story and gameplay is the option for the player to receive different endings based on choices made during the course of the game. Partway through the game, the player has the option to pursue either the \"short path\", which finishes the game rather quickly, or the \"long path\", which contains more puzzles and leads to a more satisfying ending. Upon completing either path, the player is given a clue about what choices would have led to the other ending. In addition to the two main paths and endings, the game's endings also contain many minor variables based on optional tasks in the game that the player may or may not have performed. Almost half of the game's quests are optional, many have multiple solutions, and because of the game's open world design players can solve most in any order.\n\n\n\"King's Quest\" creator and designer Roberta Williams first met with Sierra newcomer and co-designer Jane Jensen (who would go on to create the \"Gabriel Knight\" series) in May 1991 to discuss the design for the upcoming sixth title in the series. Williams began preliminary work on \"King's Quest VI\" in June, \"laying out the basic story\" and worked alongside Jensen throughout July and August on coming up with design ideas; after five months, Williams and Jensen finished the documentation for the design. Two key goals of the writers were to keep the game's tone consistent with its predecessors' while still making it a distinct title, and to make players connect emotionally with the game; Williams wrote the love story of Prince Alexander and Cassima specifically for this emotional attachment.\nCo-director and project manager Bill Skirvin and the artists created the storyboards and character sketches. John Shroades was responsible for sketching the 80 background paintings that would be used for the game. The method of motion capture was used to transcribe the movement of real-life actors shot on video to the over 2000 character actions in \"King's Quest VI\" on computer. Williams and Skirvin chose the actors and costumes for the shootings, and Michael Hutchinson led the animation team that integrated the footage into Shroades's backgrounds. The game's MIDI music was composed by Chris Braymen, who also produced the sound effects. The game's opening 3D-animated introduction was produced by Stanley Liu of Kronos Digital Entertainment, a company that did special effects for such films as \"Batman Returns\" and \"The Lawnmower Man\". This sequence was present in all versions of the game (DOS, Windows, Amiga and Macintosh) albeit with different edits and narrations across versions.\n\nJensen scripted the game, defining for programmers the game's responses for the player's actions and the over 6000 lines of written messages. Robert Lindsley served as the game's lead programmer. The game was coded on an updated version of the proprietary Sierra Creative Interpreter engine referred to as \"SCI1\". Robin Bradley served as the quality assurance tester; throughout July 1992 the game went through constant testing. Development wrapped in September, when Sierra's marketing and distribution departments began promoting and releasing the game. In an interview with \"The New York Times\", Williams estimated \"King's Quest VI\"'s budget to have been \"about $700,000\" and stated that the crew included over 20 people who worked for 14 months.\n\n\"King's Quest VI\" was initially scheduled for release in September 1992, but Sierra announced it would delayed until mid-October. It was then shipped on October 6 and launched on October 13 on nine floppy disks for DOS and Macintosh. The Amiga version was ported by Revolution Software. Sierra, which themselves converted their games for the Amiga prior to \"King's Quest VI\", announced in early 1993 that they would cease releasing games for the computer; however, Revolution co-founder Charles Cecil offered Sierra for his company to make the Amiga conversion instead. The port began development in March 1993 and was released for the Amiga in December. It uses Revolution's Virtual Theatre engine instead of SCI1 due to better performance on the computer.\nA CD-ROM version of \"King's Quest VI\", released in 1993 for DOS and Microsoft Windows, featured an extended version of the opening sequence, a full voiceover of every line of text in the game, and a revised soundtrack that includes a full version of the ballad \"Girl in the Tower\", which was composed by Mark Seibert with lyrics by Jane Jensen and serves as the game's love theme, playing in the end credits. Sierra sent a CD with the song to various radio stations and bundled with the game a pamphlet listing these stations and suggested fans to call them and ask for the song to be played. This resulted in Sierra receiving legal threats from stations bothered by excessive requests from listeners. Sierra co-founder Ken Williams responded to the stations by jokingly stating that the stations \"were the criminals for ignoring their customers — something I believe no business should ever do\". The Windows version also included higher resolution character portraits in dialogue sequences.\n\nEmmy-winning director Stuart M. Rosen directed the voice cast of \"King's Quest VI\" for the CD-ROM version, which included actor Robby Benson (voice of the Beast in Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\"), who voiced Prince Alexander. Five additional people to the game's team were involved in the development of the CD-ROM version.\n\nThe second \"King's Quest Collection\" had a number of editions in which the CD with \"King's Quest VI\" did not include the \"Girl in the Tower\" theme song audio CD track, so the Windows version simply crashed during the credits and the DOS version played the credits with no music. The \"King's Quest Collection\" release by Vivendi in 2006 includes the Windows version of the game, but is set up to run the MS-DOS version with text and speech in DOSBox.\n\nAccording to Ken Williams, \"King's Quest VI\" sold around 400,000 copies in its first week of release and topped sales charts for DOS games upon release in September 1992, still holding the number one position in December that year. The CD-ROM version was the 5th best-selling CD-ROM game in November 1993. According to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of the \"King's Quest\" series surpassed 3.8 million units by the end of March 1996. By November 2000, PC Data reported that \"King's Quest VI\"s sales in the United States alone had reached between 300,000 and 400,000 units.\n\n\"Dragon\" gave the game 5 out of 5 stars, calling it \"one of the best adventure games on the market\" and writing that it has \"enormous replay value\". Chuck Miller of \"Computer Gaming World\" stated that the number and quality of puzzles made \"King's Quest VI\" the first Sierra adventure in which he did not miss the older games' text parser. The magazine stated that while the graphic and sound were as good as other Sierra games, the animation was especially lifelike. It concluded that the game was \"the best of the \"King's Quest\" games to come out of Daventry, and Sierra's finest adventure to date ... [it] has all the signs of becoming a classic\". \"PC Format\" magazine was less positive, giving the game a score of 72%. It liked the lushly drawn graphics and pleasing sound, but disliked the game for overuse of sudden death and being too limiting. Barry Brenesal of \"PC Magazine\" wrote, \"\"King's Quest\"s latest sequel may be more of the same, but that's no cause for concern. A formula that's rooted in the likes of Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm needs no excuse for its theme. And with Sierra at the design helm, it also needs no apology for its treatment.\" \"Electronic Games\"' reviewer Russ Ceccola wrote that the game \"will fully satisfy fans of the series, inspiring them to a higher level of creativity with its almost-hidden sections and plot elements\" and named it the \"finest\" installment in the series. Writing for \"Compute!\", Scott A. May said the game balances the story to attract all audiences and wrote that \"those who love action will find plenty to pump their adrenaline, yet they won't be put off by the game's gentle, romantic side\". Just Adventure reviewer Adam Rodman gave the game an A.\n\nWhen reviewing the CD-ROM version, \"Computer Gaming World\"s Charles Ardai compared the game and series to \"vanilla ice cream\", but praised the \"incomparable\" graphics and stated that the voice acting was \"much stronger\" than in the previous game. He concluded that \"\"King's Quest VI\" is a heartily inoffensive game full of light touches and not a great deal else\"; however, \"for plain vanilla, \"King's Quest VI\" on CD-ROM is about as good as it gets\". Ardai later described the game as \"best-selling though somewhat vapid ... adventures of Princess Pubescent in the Land of Cute\". In April 1994 the magazine said that the CD version's \"quality voice talent throughout ... audibly displays that Sierra learned from their previous error\", and \"a worthy heir to the \"King's Quest\" linege\". Writing for \"CD-ROM Today\", Neil Randall praised the CD version's addition of voice acting and the voices themselves, but expressed disappointment that it doesn't improve the game's graphical details.\n\n\"CU Amiga\" gave a positive review of the Amiga version of the game, singling out praise for the mouse control interface, the graphics, characters and the conversion from PC done by Revolution, and gave it an 89% score. In an A−\nreview, Peter Olafson of \"Amiga World\" equally praised Revolution's conversion and also commended the story. \"Amiga Power\" reviewer Jonathan Davies was less enthusiastic, comparing it unfavorably with other contemporary point-and-click games in terms of innovation, and rated it 70%; \"Amiga Format\"'s Dave Golder gave a similar assessment and rated it 69%.\n\nIn retrospective reviews made in the late 2000s, Allgame gave both the PC CD-ROM and Macintosh adaptations 2½ stars out of five, while Adventure Gamers gave the game 4½ stars out of 5. \"King's Quest VI\" is generally considered the best title in the series and is mentioned as one of the greatest games of all time. \"King's Quest VI\" was inducted into GameSpot's list of the greatest games of all time, and \"PC Gamer US\" named it the 48th best computer game ever in 1994. \"Adventure Gamers\" named it the 3rd best adventure game of all time, GamesRadar placed it as the 5th best point-and-click adventure game in 2012, and Kotaku included it in its list of the 10 adventure games \"everyone must play\". In 2011, Adventure Gamers named \"King's Quest VI\" the 13th-best adventure game ever released.\n\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n"}
{"id": "1870609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870609", "title": "King's Quest VII", "text": "King's Quest VII\n\nKing's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride is a graphic adventure game developed and published by Sierra On-Line for the MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows and Macintosh computers in 1994. It features high-resolution graphics in a style reminiscent of Disney animated films and is the only \"King's Quest\" game with multiple protagonists: Queen Valanice and Princess Rosella, who are both spirited away to the realm of Eldritch, and Rosella is transformed into a troll. They must find a way to return Rosella to normal and find her true love, get rid of a powerful evil force threatening this realm, and get back to their kingdom Daventry.\n\n\"King's Quest VII\" is the only game in the series to divide the story into chapters. Although less linear in terms of ending than earlier entries in the series, \"King's Quest VII\" does not include as many different endings or optional tasks and plot threads as \"King's Quest VI\". Some puzzles do have multiple solutions, and there are two possible endings. The game's reception was highly divisive, but ultimately mostly positive.\n\n\"King's Quest VII\" is different from the previous \"King's Quest\" games in terms of structure. The action is separated into six chapters, each set primarily in a different region of the realm of Eldritch. The player alternates between two heroines, Valanice and Rosella, with each chapter. The two heroines travel through some of the same places during the course of the game, finally meeting up again in the end.\n\nAside from the multi-chapter layout, the most significant change in game structure is the simplification of user interface by the use of smart pointer. When playing the game, the pointer lights up when passed over an object that can be used. Players can get or use objects and talk to characters by directly clicking on them, whereas previous games required the player to select an action icon and then click on the environment, and can click on the environment without indicating which parts of the game could be interacted with.\n\nOne of the game's highlights is its graphics; \"King's Quest VII\" has very elaborate and colorful graphics, compared to other games of the time, with painted backgrounds and animation techniques. The game makes use of SVGA graphics, new at the time, before \"The Dig\" and \"Space Quest 6\". Also included are certain areas that pan from one side to the other, rather than going from screen to screen. Despite the cartoonish graphics characteristic of family-friendly computer games, the game includes several violent death scenes.\n\nThe name of this entry, \"The Princeless Bride\", is a pun on the title of \"The Princess Bride\". Like most \"King's Quest\" titles, it is also a reference to the plot: Princess Rosella is soon to be a bride, but ends up in another world shortly before her marriage. It is the only entry in the series to feature Queen Valanice in a major role, and also the only one in which King Graham is not shown or mentioned at all (with one minor exception in version 1.4). Sierra marketed the game as an improvement in the series by stating that completion of earlier \"KQ\" adventures was not necessary to fully enjoy the game, even though the final chapter revealed a strong connection to the events of \"King's Quest IV\".\n\nWalking through a forest in Daventry with her mother, Queen Valanice, Princess Rosella dreams of adventures in faraway lands and freedom while her mother pressures her to find a prince to marry. As they argue, Rosella sees in a pond an image of a castle in the clouds and leaps in, followed by her worried mother. The two fall through a portal together, but an arm suddenly snatches Rosella away, separating the two women.\n\nValanice ends up in a desert in the Realm of Eldritch and is left with only Rosella's comb. Valanice discovers from the ghost of a man who died in the desert that an evil witch closed the only way out, forcing Valanice to find a way to reopen it. By piecing together a turquoise arrow, Valanice manages to open the passage out and departs the desert.\n\nAt the same time, Rosella is pulled out of the portal into the Vulcanix Underground by Otar, the Troll King. To Rosella's shock and disgust, she has been transformed into a troll herself and is to be married to Otar. Seeking a cure and escape, Rosella encounters the friendly troll Mathilde who offers to concoct a potion that can cure Rosella in exchange for Rosella's help in finding answers to the Underground's recent troubles with the Land of Ooga Booga. Rosella is able to gather the ingredients and is cured, but the evil Malicia locks her away to prevent Rosella from distracting Otar. Escaping, Rosella discovers Malicia conspiring with Otar to cause the volcano the Underground is part of to erupt which will destroy the entire realm. Locating Otar's pet dragon toad, Rosella and Mathilde discover that the real Otar is being held prisoner in the Land of Ooga Booga while the one Rosella has met is an imposter working with Malicia. After escaping Malicia's clutches, Rosella uses an elevator to rise to the Land of Ooga Booga.\n\nAfter passing through the desert, Valanice discovers herself in a forest where she finds Attis and Ceres, the Lord of the Hunt and Mother Nature, have been transformed into a stag and a tree respectively by Malicia. Worse, Malicia drove an iron stake into Ceres' roots, leaving her with a life-threatening wound that could spell disaster for nature if Ceres dies. Making her way to a nearby town, Valanice agrees to steal a magical statuette in exchange for a salve that will allow her to pass through a dangerous part of the forest. Though Valanice succeeds in stealing the statuette, she is arrested after recovering a giant block of cheese that falls from the sky, the moon of the realm.\n\nRosella successfully reaches the Land of Ooga Booga, but the passage back to the Underground collapses behind her. With the help of local Doctor Mort Cadaver, Rosella begins seeking out the real Otar while coming up against many challenges. After rescuing a black cat, Rosella receives one of the cat's lives and the location of Otar. With the help of a gravedigger she helped earlier, Rosella manages to reach Otar, but is imprisoned with him by Malicia. Using the dragon toad, the two escape and plot to return to the Underground to foil Malicia using a secret entrance hidden somewhere in the town. With help from Mort, they bypass one of Malicia's monsters to enter a swamp, but Otar convinces Rosella to enter Malicia's house and steal back a mysterious device that is the only thing that can stop Malicia. After evading a werewolf, the two manage to find the secret entrance in the town hall and reenter the Underground.\n\nIn exchange for returning the moon to the sky, Valanice is pardoned and manages to retrieve the salve. Acting on advice from a rock spirit, Valanice restarts the local river, breaking Attis' curse. Using the salve to get past the werewolf, Valanice makes her way to the Land of Ooga Booga where she locates and returns the Headless Horseman's head after being informed of recent events by the black cat. In return, he allows Valanice use of his horse Necromancer to reach Etheria. In Etheria, Valanice locates the Fates who tell her that the king and queen are gone and she must travel to a dreamworld to speak to Mab, the lady of dreams. Valanice is also able to get the ambrosia she needs to restore a magical cornucopia and break Ceres' curse. With the help of Mort, Valanice is able to enter the dreamworld while asleep, only to discover Mab frozen in a block of ice. With Ceres' help, Valanice is able to find a way to break the curse while Mab's brother provides a way into the dreamworld while she is awake. Valanice frees Mab who helps Valanice use the winds to contact King Oberon and Queen Titania. With the volcano close to erupting, the king and queen return to help.\n\nAfter reaching the volcano's control room, Rosella and Otar encounter the imposter. Using Otar's magic wand, Rosella restores the imposter to his true form, revealing him to be Edgar, the handsome fairy she encountered in Tamir who helped her save her father. Malicia knocks Otar out, blows Edgar away and imprisons Rosella who manages to escape and return to the control room. As Oberon, Titania and Mab attempt to contain the volcano, Rosella manages to awaken Otar who stops the eruption. With the help of Edgar and Necromancer, Valanice is finally reunited with her daughter, only to have Malicia attack. Malicia kills Edgar, but Rosella manages to use the device she recovered from Malicia's house to turn Malicia into an infant.\n\nThe game offers two different endings after the final confrontation with Malicia. In the good ending, Rosella revives Edgar using the extra life she received from the black cat she helped in the Land of Ooga Booga. King Oberon and Queen Titania arrive and reveal that Edgar is their son who was kidnapped as a child by the evil fairy Lolotte before Rosella rescued him while in Tamir. He was subsequently kidnapped again and brainwashed by Malicia who Titania intends to raise to be a better person the second time around. Edgar reveals that he is the one who pulled Rosella to Eldritch and apologizes for his actions. Rosella agrees to Edgar's request to court her and the entire realm celebrates Malicia's defeat and the return of their prince.\n\nIn the bad ending, Rosella fails to revive Edgar and he dies. Oberon and Titania arrive and sadly explain what happened to him before taking Valanice and Rosella home.\n\n\nThe developers aimed for the effect of traditional animation works by Walt Disney Pictures and Don Bluth. As such, the full game contains more than five times the animation of any other Sierra game of the time. Art director Andy Hoyos specifically cited the intensity of the colors in Disney's \"Aladdin\" as an inspiration model. Composer Jay Usher said, \"Just seeing how a character carries himself, acts, or walks ultimately determines the outcome of the music. We've tried to give each character [their] own 'mini-theme'. Each character is unique, so the music should be as well.\" The final game was much shortened from an earlier concept in order to fit the game on a single CD-ROM.\n\nThe game's backgrounds were hand-drawn and scanned. The game sprites were pencil-drawn on paper and also scanned, and then edited and colored digitally, not unlike the traditional animation process in animated feature films of the era. Of the 70 characters that appear in the game, some are more realistic and human-like (like the protagonists) and others more cartoony. According to lead animator (and character designer) Marc Hudgins, it was the first time when the art department had to use outside (Russian and Croatian) animation houses. Part of the challenge had to do with the fact that the animators had no experience in computer game animation.\n\nAccording to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of the \"King's Quest\" series surpassed 3.8 million units by the end of March 1996. By November 2000, PC Data reported that \"King's Quest VII\"s sales in the United States alone had reached between 300,000 and 400,000 units.\n\nSome critics and fans of the series disliked the use of Disney-style cartoon graphics. On the other hand, upon release \"PCZone\" praised its \"stunning graphics and superb gameplay.\" A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" approved of the series's transition from idealized fantasy imagery to highly detailed cartoon graphics, and said the game maintained the \"King's Quest\" standard for outstanding soundtracks. He concluded, \"While it's certainly not the most challenging game available, it may be one of the most impressive in look and feel, and fans of the series should definitely check this one out.\" A review in \"Computer Gaming World\" hailed the game's \"animation of quality that would make Disney proud.\" A retrospective verdict in Adventure Gamers described it as \"an eminently playable, if not revolutionary, adventure game,\" and \"a solid—if not stellar—entry in the \"King’s Quest\" collection.\"\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" nominated \"King's Quest VII\" as its 1994 \"Adventure of the Year\", although it lost to \"\". The editors called \"King's Quest VII\" \"one of the year's most charming releases\", and concluded, \"The feature-quality animation and the hodge-podge of classic tales make it the closest we're likely to come to a fairy tale on the computer.\"\n\n"}

He was formerly the head of the social communication office of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration, a position which carried a ministerial rank. He was a second-generation Japanese-Brazilian, with Ryukyuan parents from Okinawa.\n\nIn his youth he was a supporter of O Trabalho, a party linked to the French Organisation Communiste Internationaliste (OCI). He broke with this international current to work closely with Lula in the PT. He worked at Banespa bank and was associated with unions. He was elected a federal deputy in the Congress three times, from 1987 to 1998, and was the coordinator of the presidential campaigns for Lula in 1989 and 1998.\n\nLuiz Gushiken was born in the small town of Osvaldo Cruz (in Presidente Prudente) and was the first-born son of seven children of the photographer and violinist Shoei and Setsu Gushiken, Japanese immigrants from Okinawa. While he was still a young man, he moved to the city of São Paulo. He lived in the Brás suburb of the city and began to work as a bank clerk at the São Paulo State Bank (Banespa), where he stayed until 1999.\n\nHe began his political life as a union leader and participated intensely in the strikes of the 1980s during the military dictatorship. He presided over the São Paulo Banker's Union from 1984 to 1986. He was arrested four times by the military regime's Department for Political and Social Order (\"Departamento de Ordem Política e Social\" or DOPS\").\" He was also one of the founders of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT) and the Unified Worker's Centre (CUT), in addition to being one of its leaders (he was the Workers' party's National President from 1988 to 1990).\n\nHe was a member (\"deputado federal\") of the \"Câmara dos Deputados do Brasil\" for three consecutive parliamentary terms (including in the Brazilian Constituent Assembly (1988)) from 1987 until 1999, and presidential campaign coordinator for Lula in 1989 and 1998. He was also the head of the \"Secretaria de Comunicação Social\"\" \"(SeCom), part of the Presidency of Brazil\".\"\n\nIn 2005, Gushiken was accused - and defended himself - in ongoing lawsuits at the Court of Accounts of the Union (\"Tribunal de Contas da União\", TCU) \"and at the Supreme Federal Court (\"Supremo Tribunal Federal, STF\")\". He left SeCom and lost the rank of minister, assuming the position as Chief of the Center for Strategic Affairs (\"Núcleo de Assuntos Estratégicos\", NAE).

Gushiken distinguished himself in his defense of PREVI (\"Caixa de Previdência dos Funcionários do Banco do Brasil\", the pension fund for workers of Banco do Brasil) during the privatizations promoted by the Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration, when the fund was used to incorporate consortiums of foreign corporations in auctions of the iron and steel, electric and telephone service sectors.\n\nHe was the target of relentless media campaigns, suffering frequent accusations - none of which were ever proven - related to the use of SeCom funds. Out of office, his house came under malicious attacks and came to be wrongly included in the AP 470 (the Mensalão Scandal criminal lawsuit) by the attorney General Antonio Fernando de Souza - who would come to win a Brasil Telecom mega contract, controlled by Daniel Dantas and which entered into the creation of Oi-Telemar.\n\nGushiken was accused of being part of a cash-for-votes scandal, known as the Mensalão Scandal, after which he was demoted and left the government soon thereafter. Later he was acquitted from all accusations in the AP 470 criminal lawsuit, in a verdict from the Supreme Federal Court decided in 2012, due to lack of evidence from his role in the scandal. Ex-Minister of the Supreme Federal Court José Dirceu later commented that Gushiken's indictment was \"one of the great injustices of the [Mensalão scandal]\" and \"with no regard for the presumption of innocence\". Notwithstanding, the press was no less brutal in its remorseless campaign against all of those who were indicted in the scandal, with no formal apology being made for the rash and misguided conclusions of reporters.\n\nGushiken died on September 13, 2013, at the age of 63 whilst admitted to Hospital Sírio-Libanês in critical condition, due to gastric cancer from which he suffered since 2002.

It is now known that \"M. grisea\" consists of a cryptic species complex containing at least two biological species that have clear genetic differences and do not interbreed. Complex members isolated from \"Digitaria\" have been more narrowly defined as \"M. grisea\". The remaining members of the complex isolated from rice and a variety of other hosts have been renamed Magnaporthe oryzae. Confusion on which of these two names to use for the rice blast pathogen remains, as both are now used by different authors.\n\nMembers of the \"Magnaporthe grisea\" complex can also infect other agriculturally important cereals including wheat, rye, barley, and pearl millet causing diseases called blast disease or blight disease. Rice blast causes economically significant crop losses annually. Each year it is estimated to destroy enough rice to feed more than 60 million people. The fungus is known to occur in 85 countries worldwide.\n\n\"M. grisea\" is an ascomycete fungus. It is an extremely effective plant pathogen as it can reproduce both sexually and asexually to produce specialized infectious structures known as appressoria that infect aerial tissues and hyphae that can infect root tissues.\n\nRice blast has been observed on rice strains M-201, M-202, M-204, M-205, M-103, M-104, S-102, L-204, Calmochi-101, with M-201 being the most vulnerable. Initial symptoms are white to gray-green lesions or spots with darker borders produced on all parts of the shoot, while older lesions are elliptical or spindle-shaped and whitish to gray with necrotic borders. Lesions may enlarge and coalesce to kill the entire leaf. Symptoms are observed on all above-ground parts of the plant. Lesions can be seen on the leaf collar, culm, culm nodes, and panicle neck node. Internodal infection of the culm occurs in a banded pattern. Nodal infection causes the culm to break at the infected node (rotten neck). It also affects reproduction by causing the host to produce fewer seeds. This is caused by the disease preventing maturation of the actual grain.\n\nThe pathogen infects as a spore that produces lesions or spots on parts of the rice plant such as the leaf, leaf collar, panicle, culm and culm nodes. Using a structure called an appressorium, the pathogen penetrates the plant. The pathogen is able to move between the plant cells using its invasive hyphae to enter through plasmodesmata. \"M. grisea\" then sporulates from the diseased rice tissue to be dispersed as conidiospores. After overwintering in sources such as rice straw and stubble, the cycle repeats.\n\nA single cycle can be completed in about a week under favorable conditions where one lesion can generate up to thousands of spores in a single night. Disease lesions, however, can appear in three to four days after infection. With the ability to continue to produce the spores for over 20 days, rice blast lesions can be devastating to susceptible rice crops.\n\nRice blast is a significant problem in temperate regions and can be found in areas such as irrigated lowland and upland. Conditions conducive for rice blast include long periods of free moisture where leaf wetness is required for infection and high humidity is common. Sporulation increases with high relative humidity and at 77-82 degrees F, spore germination, lesion formation, and sporulation are at optimum levels.\n\nIn terms of control, excessive use of nitrogen fertilization as well as drought stress increase rice susceptibility to the pathogen as the plant is placed in a weakened state and its defenses are low. Extended drain periods also favor infection as they aerate the soil, converting ammonium to nitrate and thus causing stress to rice crops, as well.\n\nThe fungus has been able to establish resistance to both chemical treatments and genetic resistance in some types of rice developed by plant breeders. It is thought that the fungus can achieve this by genetic change through mutation. In order to most effectively control infection by \"M. grisea\", an integrated management program should be implemented to avoid overuse of a single control method and fight against genetic resistance. For example, eliminating crop residue could reduce the occurrence of overwintering and discourage inoculation in subsequent seasons. Another strategy would be to plant resistant rice varieties that are not as susceptible to infection by \"M. grisea\". Knowledge of the pathogenicity of \"M. grisea\" and its need for free moisture suggest other control strategies such as regulated irrigation and a combination of chemical treatments with different modes of action. Managing the amount of water supplied to the crops limits spore mobility thus dampening the opportunity for infection. Chemical controls such as Carpropamid have been shown to prevent penetration of the appressoria into rice epidermal cells, leaving the grain unaffected.\n\nRice blast is the most important disease concerning the rice crop in the world. Since rice is an important food source for much of the world, its effects have a broad range. It has been found in over 85 countries across the world and reached the United States in 1996. Every year the amount of crops lost to rice blast could feed 60 million people. Although there are some resistant strains of rice, the disease persists wherever rice is grown. The disease has never been eradicated from a region.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released by United Artists and stars Richard Burton as Alexander along with a large ensemble cast. Italian composer Mario Nascimbene contributed the film score.\n\nThe Greek orator Demosthenes of Athens is advocating war to resist King Philip II of Macedon and his planned invasion and takeover of all the city-states of Greece.\n\nWhile Philip II is leading a campaign to take over Olynthus, he is informed that his spouse Olympias has borne him a son who, she claims, is \"a god born of a god.\" Philip is angry because he suspects that Olympias has committed adultery and that she was not impregnated by a god. However, General Parmenio advises the king to let Alexander grow up and succeed him.\n\nWhile growing up, Alexander receives instruction in history, mathematics, logic and other subjects from Aristotle in Mieza. Alexander is eager to rule and tells his tutor that like Achilles he would rather have a \"short life with glory\" than a \"long life of obscurity.\" Philip then decides to send Alexander to the Macedonian capital, Pella, as a regent to rule the city while Philip is away fighting wars. This is done to prevent Olympias from spreading rumors about her husband's death. Alexander uses this opportunity to rule in his own right — he becomes neither a pawn of his mother nor his father. Alexander later joins Philip and they go on campaigns of conquest together against cities such as Athens in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. After the battle is won, Alexander demands that no Greek city-state ever bear arms against Pella and that they supply men, arms, and ships for the war against Persia.\n\nPhilip II divorces Olympias, accusing her of \"unfaithfulness\", and marries Attalus's niece Eurydice, thereby making her the new queen. This move creates a chasm between Alexander and his father, not only because Alexander's mother has been repudiated but also because his succession hangs in the balance since some men in Philip's court see him as a bastard.\n\nPausanias, a loyal friend of Alexander, assassinates Philip II, whereupon Alexander kills Pausanias then and there. At this juncture, Alexander claims the loyalty of all Macedonians and assumes the titles of his father. He tells the Macedonians that the Treaty of Corinth still stands. Memnon is exiled for not pledging his loyalty to Alexander.\n\nAlexander embarks on his mission to conquer the whole of Asia. Memnon, who is now in Darius III's court, advises him to retreat strategically and attack Alexander when his supplies run out. However, the lords of Persia underestimate the \"boy\" Alexander and resolve to fight him at the river Granicus.\n\nAfter the victory at the Granicus, Alexander goes to Phrygia and solves the challenge of the knot tied by King Gordius by cutting it with his sword.\n\nBefore the battle in Babylon, Alexander states that the lunar eclipse which some of his men thought was a bad omen means that \"the Persian moon will be eclipsed by the Macedonian Sun\" with which Aristander the seer agrees. After being defeated, Darius III flees to the Caspian Gates to build a new army, but his dispirited commanders kill him. In his will, Darius tells Alexander, \"Take my daughter, Roxane, for your wife...that our worlds may become as one.\" Alexander then orders Persian lords who had committed regicide to be impaled upon stakes for their betrayal of their king.\n\nAt a drunken revelry in Babylon, Alexander declares, \"I am the son of God\" (Zeus) and \"the world is my domain...We will march to the end of the world.\" In Athens, news reaches that Alexander is in India and is conquering there, whereupon Aeschines proclaims, \"He has outdone the gods.\"\n\nAlexander takes his status to heart, his arrogance and paranoia increasing to unstable proportions, but the bold young leader's conquests come to an end after he kills his close friend, Cleitus, with his spear following a drunken argument. Grief-stricken and humbled, Alexander returns to Babylon from India, losing many of his men in the process. He marries Roxane at Susa, but falls ill soon after. When asked upon his deathbed to whom he will leave his empire, Alexander whispers, \"To the strongest.\"\n\nCharlton Heston was sought for the title role, but turned it down, stating \"Alexander is the easiest kind of picture to make badly\". The decision to hire Richard Burton was later criticised as he looked too old for the part, despite being only 29 at the time. Alexander, who reigned from the age of 20 until his death at age 32, was supposed to be a teenager in the first hour of the film.\n\nDirector Robert Rossen shot the film to run for over three hours, complete with an intermission, and was hugely disappointed when the producers cut the film down to 141 minutes.\n\nA. H. Weiler of \"The New York Times\" wrote that despite the film's length \"its moments of boredom are rare,\" and that the battle scenes \"make a colorful and thunderous show.\" He added, \"As Alexander, Richard Burton contributes a serious and impassioned portrayal of a man inspired by but still repelled by his father.\" \"Variety\" wrote that the film had some \"long, dull stretches\" but \"Rossen reaches screen-filling heights with his battle-assemblages, jamming the 2.55-1 anamorphic ratio to its very edges with scene after scene of mass warfare.\" In his write-up of the L.A. premiere, Edwin Schallert of the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated: \"The initial audience had a chance to view some very powerful individual portrayals by Burton, March and others and to witness some overwhelmingly big and spectacular battle and crowd scenes. However, as a piece of storytelling, historical or otherwise, mainly revolving around the title character as a great conqueror for Greece, the film seemed to run off in a dozen and one different directions at practically every stage.\"\n\nRichard L. Coe of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that the film \"is, for a movie, so remarkably faithful to historical fact that it is more the pity that, as a movie, it is so boring ... Such is the power of detailed pictures that repetition of battle scenes, leave-takings, orations and intrigue simply becomes dizzyingly meaningless.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" wrote, \"Beautifully photographed in CinemaScope and Technicolor, it is without a doubt one of the most opulently mounted pictures ever produced, a magnificent eye-filling epic with a scope and splendor that is alone worth the price of admission to see.\" John McCarten of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that \"while the picture has plenty of interesting pageantry, it doesn't offer quite enough drama to hold one's attention for its full length—a matter of two and a half hours. Far too much of that time is spent in detailing the Macedonian's unhappy youth.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote, \"Conviction is considerably dissipated here by Rossen's refusal, in spite of obviously serious intentions, to present character in terms much more convincing than those of comic strip history ... The battle sequences are well composed, but the generally pedestrian style and approach of the production ultimately reduce \"Alexander the Great\" to a well-intentioned historical jamboree, protracted and intermittently quite enjoyable.\"\n\nThe film has a 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes of \"0%\" derived from eight reviews.\n\n\n"}

During the Interregnum, England was under various forms of republican government (see Commonwealth of England; this article describes other facets of the Interregnum).\n\nThe politics of the period were dominated by the wishes of the \"Grandees\" (Senior Officers) of the New Model Army and their civilian supporters. They encouraged (or at least tolerated) several republican regimes.\n\nFrom 1649 until 1653 executive powers lay with Council of State, while legislative functions were carried out by the Rump Parliament.\n\nIn 1653 the Grandees, with Oliver Cromwell in the lead, dismissed the Rump, and replaced it with a Nominated Assembly (nicknamed the Parliament of Saints and Barebone's Parliament) made up of 140 nominees, 129 from England and Wales, five from Scotland and six from Ireland. It proved to be as difficult for the executive to work with this parliament as it had with the Rump, so, after sitting for five months, members friendly to the Grandees engendered its dissolution on 12 December 1653.\n\nThe \"Instrument of Government\" was adopted on 15 December 1653 and the pre-eminent \"Grandee\" Oliver Cromwell was installed as Lord Protector on the following day. The \"Instrument of Government\" granted executive power to the Lord Protector. Although this post was elective, not hereditary, it was to be held for life. It also required the calling of triennial Parliaments, with each sitting for at least five months.\n\nIn January 1655, Cromwell dissolved the first Protectorate Parliament, ushering in a period of military rule by the Major Generals.\n\nThe \"Instrument of Government\" was replaced in May 1657 by England's second, and last, codified constitution, the Humble Petition and Advice. However Oliver Cromwell died the next year and his nominated successor as Lord Protector, his son Richard, proved unable to govern effectively as various political parties strove to gain power.\n\nThe Protectorate came to an end in May 1659 when the Grandees recalled the Rump Parliament, which authorised a Committee of Safety to replace Richard's Council of State. This ushered in a period of unstable government, which did not come to an end until February 1660 when General George Monck, the English military governor of Scotland, marched to London at the head of his troops, and oversaw the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II.\n\nAfter the Parliamentarian victory in the Civil War, the Puritan views of the majority of Parliament and its supporters began to be imposed on the rest of the country. The Puritans advocated an austere lifestyle and restricted what they saw as the excesses of the previous regime. Most prominently, holidays such as Christmas and Easter were suppressed. Pastimes such as the theatre and gambling were also banned. However, some forms of art that were thought to be \"virtuous\", such as opera, were encouraged. These changes are often credited to Oliver Cromwell, though they were introduced by the Commonwealth Parliament; and Cromwell, when he came to power, was a liberalising influence.\n\nRabbi Menasseh Ben Israel met Oliver Cromwell in 1655 in order to discuss the admission of Jews into England. Cromwell did not agree to all the rights that Ben Israel requested, but the opening of Jewish synagogues and burial grounds was tolerated under Cromwell's Protectorate. The Jewish faith was still not practised openly in England, since Cromwell's move had been controversial and many in England were still hostile toward Jews. Life for Jews in England improved in that they could no longer be prosecuted if caught worshipping, yet discrimination continued.\n\nParliament had, to a large degree, encouraged the radical political groups which emerged when the usual social controls broke down during the English Civil War. It had also unwittingly established a new political force when it set up the New Model Army. Not surprisingly, all these groups had their own hopes for the new Commonwealth.\n\nLed by John Lilburne, Levellers drew their main support from London and the Army. In the Agreement of the People, 1649, they asked for a more representative and accountable parliament, to meet every two years; a reform of law so it would be available to and fair to all; and religious toleration. They wanted a more democratic society, although their proposed franchise did not extend to women or to the lowest orders of society.\n\nLevellers saw the Rump as little better than the monarchy it had replaced, and they showed their displeasure in demonstrations, pamphlets and mutinies. While their numbers did not pose a serious threat to the government, they scared the Rump into action and a Treasons Act was passed against them in 1649.\n\nLed by Gerrard Winstanley, Diggers wanted an even more equal society than the Levellers. They advocated a lifestyle that bore many similarities to later understandings of communism and anarchism, with communal ownership of land, and absolute equality for males and females in law and education. They existed in only very small numbers and faced a very strong opposition, even from the Levellers.\n\nThe breakdown of religious uniformity and incomplete Presbyterian Settlement of 1646 enabled independent churches to flourish. The main sects (\"see also English Dissenters\") were Baptists, who advocated adult rebaptism; Ranters, who claimed that sin did not exist for the \"chosen ones\"; and Fifth Monarchy Men, who opposed all \"earthly\" governments, believing they must prepare for God's kingdom on earth by establishing a \"government of saints\".\n\nDespite greater toleration, extreme sects were opposed by the upper classes as they were seen as a threat to social order and property rights.\nCatholics were also excluded from the toleration applied to the other groups.\n\nConservatives were still dominant in both central government and local government. In the former, the Rump was anxious not to offend the traditional ruling class whose support it needed for survival, so it opposed radical ideas. In the latter, that ruling class dominated through the influence of traditional regional gentry.\n\nThe Interregnum was a relatively short but important period in the history of the British Isles. It saw a number of political experiments without any stable form of government emerging, largely due to the wide diversity in religious and political groups that had been allowed to flourish after the regicide of Charles I.\n\nThe Puritan movement had evolved as a rejection of both real and perceived \"Catholicisation\" of the Church of England. When the Church of England was quickly disestablished by the Commonwealth Government, the question of what church to establish became a hotly debated subject. In the end, it was impossible to make all the political factions happy. During the Interregnum, Oliver Cromwell lost much of the support he had gained during the Civil War. Edward Sexby, previously a supporter of Cromwell's, felt disenfranchised by Cromwell's failure to abolish the aristocracy. In 1657, Silius Titus called for Cromwell's assassination in a co-authored pamphlet \"Killing No Murder\" under the pseudonym of William Allen. Sexby was captured when he returned to England and attempted to carry out the assassination described in Colonel Titus' book. Cromwell coerced Sexby into confessing authorship of the pamphlet and then imprisoned him in the Tower of London, where Sexby was driven to insanity, dying there less than a year later.\n\nHigh taxes required by the large standing army, kept due to the constant threats of Scottish and Irish rebellion, added to public resentment of Cromwell.\n"}
{"id": "1870665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870665", "title": "Shinbutsu-shūgō", "text": "Shinbutsu-shūgō\n\nShinbutsu-shūgō (, \"syncretism of kami and buddhas\"), also called Shinbutsu-konkō (, \"jumbling up\" or \"contamination of kami and buddhas\"), is the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism that was Japan's only organized religion up until the Meiji period. Beginning in 1868, the new Meiji government approved a series of laws that separated Japanese native kami worship, on one side, from Buddhism which had assimilated it, on the other.\n\nWhen Buddhism was introduced from China in the Asuka period (6th century) the Japanese tried to reconcile the new beliefs with the older Shinto beliefs, assuming both were true. As a consequence, Buddhist temples (, \"tera\") were attached to local Shinto shrines (, \"jinja\") and vice versa and devoted to both kami and buddhas. The local religion and foreign Buddhism never quite fused, but remained inextricably linked to the present day through interaction. The depth of the influence from Buddhism on local religious beliefs can be seen in much of Shinto's conceptual vocabulary and even the types of Shinto shrines seen today. The large worship halls and religious images, are themselves of Buddhist origin. The formal separation of Buddhism from Shinto took place only as recently as the end of the 19th century; however, in many ways, the blending of the two still continues.\n\nThe term \"shinbutsu shūgō\" itself was coined during the early modern era (17th century) to refer to the amalgamation of kami and \"buddhas\" in general, as opposed to specific currents within Buddhism which did the same, e.g. Ryōbu Shintō and Sannō Shintō. The term may have a negative connotation of bastardization and randomness. It is a yojijukugo phrase.\n\nThere is no agreement among specialists as to the exact extent of fusion between the two religions.\n\nAccording to some scholars (for example Hirai Naofusa in Japan and Joseph Kitagawa in the US), Shinto is the indigenous religion of Japan, has existed as such continuously since its prehistory, and consists of all the peculiarly Japanese rituals and beliefs shaped by Japanese history from prehistory to the present. The term \"Shinto\" itself was coined in the 6th century to differentiate the previously disparate local religious practices from imported Buddhism.\n\nThe opposing view of Japanese historian Toshio Kuroda and his supporters is that Shinto as an independent religion was born only in the modern period after emerging in the Middle Ages as an offshoot of Buddhism, that Shinto as a distinct religion is a Meiji era invention of Japanese nationalist ideologues. (See the section The two religions after the Separation Order below.) Kuroda points out how the state formalization of \"kami\" rituals and the state ranking of shrines during the Heian period were not the emergence of Shinto as an independent religion, but an effort to explain local beliefs in Buddhist terms. He also says that, while it is true that the two characters for \"Shinto\" appear very early in the historical record (for example in the Nihon Shoki), this does not mean today's Shinto already existed as a religion because the same word was originally used for Taoism or even for religion in general. Indeed, according to Kuroda, many features of Shinto (for example the worshiping of mirrors and swords or the very structure of the Ise Shrine, Shinto's holiest and most important site) are typical of Taoism. The term \"Shinto\" in old texts therefore does not necessarily indicate something uniquely Japanese.\n\nStill according to this view, Shinto's rise as an autonomous religion was gradual and started to become evident with the emergence of Yoshida Kanetomo's Yoshida Shintō. The term Shinto started to be used with today's meaning of \"kami\" worship only later during the Edo period. During the same era, Kokugaku theorists like Motoori Norinaga tried to separate it intellectually from Buddhism, preparing the ground for the final schism of the Meiji Restoration.\n\nAccording to the first view, then, the two religions were at the time of their first meeting already formed and independent and thereafter just coexisted with non-essential exchanges. According to the second, Buddhism, meeting local kami beliefs in Japan, actually produced today's Shinto.\n\nThe fusion of Buddhism with the local kami worship started as soon as the first arrived in Japan. Mononobe no Okoshi wrote, \"The kami of our land will be offended if we worship a foreign kami.\" Mononobe saw Gautama Buddha as just another kami. Foreign kami were called or , and understood to be more or less like local ones. Initially, therefore, the conflict between the two religions was political, and not religious, in nature, a struggle between the progressive Soga clan, that wanted a more international outlook for the country, and the conservative Mononobe clan, that wanted the contrary.\n\nBuddhism was not passive in the assimilation process, but was itself ready to assimilate and be assimilated. By the time it entered Japan it was already syncretic, having adapted to and amalgamated with other religions and cultures in India, China, and the Korean Peninsula. For example, already while in India, it had absorbed Hindu divinities like Brahma (\"Bonten\" in Japanese) and Indra (\"Taishakuten\"). When it arrived in Japan, it already had a disposition towards producing the combinatory gods that the Japanese would call . Searching for the origins of a kami in Buddhist scriptures was felt to be nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nHowever, if monks didn't doubt the existence of kami, they certainly saw them as inferior to their buddhas. Hindu gods had already been treated analogously: they had been thought of as un-illuminated and prisoners of \"saṃsāra\". Buddhist claims of superiority encountered resistance, and monks tried to overcome them by deliberately integrating kami into their system. Several strategies to do this were developed and deployed.\n\nThe process of amalgamation is usually divided into three stages.\n\nThe first articulation of the difference between Japanese religious ideas and Buddhism, and the first effort to reconcile the two is attributed to Prince Shōtoku (574–622), and the first signs that the differences between the two world views were beginning to become manifest to the Japanese in general appear at the time of Emperor Tenmu (673–86). Accordingly, one of the first efforts to reconcile Shinto and Buddhism was made in the 8th century during the Nara period founding so-called , that is \"shrine-temples\", complexes comprising both a shrine and a temple.\n\nBehind the inclusion in a Shinto shrine of Buddhist religious objects was the idea that the kami were lost beings in need of liberation through Buddhism like any other sentient beings. Kami were thought to be subject to karma and reincarnation like human beings, and early Buddhist stories tell how the task of helping suffering kami was assumed by wandering monks. A local kami would appear in a dream to the monk, telling him about his suffering. To improve the kami's karma through rites and the reading of sutras, Buddhist monks would build temples next to kami shrines. Such groupings had been created by the 7th century, for example at Usa Jingū in Kyūshū, where Hachiman was worshiped together with Maitreya. The building of temples at shrines produced shrine-temple complexes, which in turn accelerated the amalgamation process. As a result of the creation of shrine-temple complexes, many shrines that had until then been just an open-air site became Buddhist style groupings of buildings.\n\nAt the end of the same century, in what is considered the second stage of the amalgamation, the kami Hachiman was declared a dharmapala and, later, a bodhisattva. Shrines for him started to be built at temples (the so-called \"temple-shrines\"), marking an important step ahead in the process of amalgamation of kami and Buddhism. When the great buddha at Tōdai-ji in Nara was built, there was also erected within the temple grounds a shrine for Hachiman – according to the legend because of a wish expressed by the kami himself. Hachiman considered this his reward for having helped the temple find the gold and copper mines from which the metal for the great statue had come. After this, temples in the entire country adopted tutelary kami (.\n\nThe third and final stage of the fusion took place in the 9th century with the development of the theory according to which Japanese kami are emanations of buddhas, \"bodhisattvas\" or devas who mingle with human beings to lead them to the Buddhist Way. This theory was the keystone of the whole \"shinbutsu shūgō\" edifice and therefore the foundation of Japanese religion for many centuries. Because of it, most kami changed from potentially dangerous spirits to be improved through contact with the Buddhist law to local emanations of buddhas and bodhisattvas which possess a wisdom of their own. Buddhas and kami were now indivisible twins.\n\nThe status of kami however changed dramatically according to the sect. At one extreme one was Shingon Buddhism's Ryōbu Shintō thinkers, who considered kami and buddhas equivalent in power and dignity. However, not all kami were emanations of some buddha. Some, often called , usually dangerous and angry, had no Buddhist counterpart. Among them were the \"tengu\", or animals possessing magic, as the fox (\"kitsune\") or . Even these unholy and inferior \"true kami\" however attracted the attention of Ryōbu Shinto thinkers, which resulted in theories which declared them to be manifestations of Vairocana and Amaterasu.\n\nOn the other hand, Pure Land Buddhism was somewhat different because it at first renounced kami-worship due to the notion that kami were inferior to the buddhas. However, the largest Pure Land branch, Jōdo Shinshū, still encouraged the worship of kami despite the fact that faith in Amida Buddha should be the primary practice. Furthermore, under the influence of Rennyo and other leaders, Jōdo Shinshū accepted the mainstream honji suijaku beliefs and the spiritual relationship between kami and the buddhas and bodhisattvas.\n\nThe two religions however never fused completely and, while overlapping here and there, kept their particular identity within a difficult, largely un-systematized and tense relationship. This relationship existed, rather than between two systems, between particular kami and particular buddhas. The two were always perceived as parallel but separate entities. Besides \"shinbutsu shūgō\" there was always the other side of the coin of continued separation.\n\nIn fact, the term in Japanese Buddhist terminogy refers to the tendency that existed in Japan to keep some kami separate from Buddhism. While some kami were integrated in Buddhism, others (or at times even the same kami in a different context) were kept systematically away from Buddhism. This phenomenon had significant consequences for Japanese culture as a whole. It must not be confused with \"shinbutsu bunri\" (\"separation of kami and buddhas\") or with \"haibutsu kishaku\" (\"abolish buddhas and destroy Shākyamuni\"), which are phenomena recurrent in Japanese history and usually due to political causes. While the first assumes the acceptance of Buddhism, the second and third actually oppose it.\n\nThe practice had in any case important consequences, among them the prevention of the complete assimilation of kami practices into Buddhism. Also, the prohibition of Buddhism at the Ise and Kamo Shrines allowed them to freely develop their theories about the nature of kami.\n\nDuring the \"Shinbutsu bunri\", the attempt to separate Shinto from Buddhism, temples and shrines were forcefully separated by law with the of 1868.\n\nHowever, in spite of more than a century of formal separation of the two religions, temples or shrines that do not separate them are still common, as proven for example by the existence of some important Buddhist Inari shrines. During the Meiji period, in order to help the spread of Shinto, shrine-temples (\"jingū-ji\") were destroyed while temple-shrines (\"chinjusha\") were tolerated. As a result, shrine-temples are now rare (an extant example is Seiganto-ji), but temple-shrines are common, and most temples still have at least a small one.\n\nProminent religious institutions in both camps still give evidence of integration of the two religions. The great Kenchō-ji temple, number one of the Kamakura's great Zen temples (the Five Mountain System) includes two shrines. One of the islands in the right-side pond of Tsurugaoka Hachimangū in Kamakura hosts a subshrine dedicated to goddess Benzaiten, a form of Saraswati. For this reason, the sub-shrine was removed in 1868 at the time of the \"Shinbutsu Bunri\", but rebuilt in 1956.\n\nShinto and Buddhism still have a symbiotic relationship of interdependence, particularly concerning funeral rites (entrusted to Buddhism) and weddings (usually left to Shinto or sometimes Christianity). The separation of the two religions is therefore considered only superficial, and \"shinbutsu shūgō\" is still an accepted practice.\n\nStill, the separation of the two religions is felt to be real by the public. Scholar Karen Smyers comments, \"The surprise of many of my informants regarding the existence of Buddhist Inari temples shows the success of the government's attempt to create separate conceptual categories regarding sites and certain identities, although practice remains multiple and nonexclusive\".\n\n\n"}

Being founded in 1899 and initially offering a single course in civil engineering, it grew to become a major technical Czech university with over 24,000 students enrolled at 8 faculties and 2 university institutes.\n\nThe Jesuits dominated university education in Moravia at the beginning of 18th century as they controlled the University of Olomouc. The focus on theology and philosophy was unwelcomed by the Moravian nobility. The nobility initiated commencement of law education at the University of Olomouc in 1679. Later in 1725 the Moravian nobility enforced establishment of the Academy of Nobility in Olomouc. Law and economy, mathematics, geometry, civil and military architecture, history and geography were lectured there. As it aimed to promote knighthood also foreign languages, dance, swordsmanship and equitation were taught there. The Academy was in Olomouc until 1847, when it was relocated to Brno, where it became bases for what was later to become the University of Technology.\n\nDue to extinction of the University in Olomouc, there was no institution that would provide an academic education in Moravia and only one technical school, besides German one, could not cover the lack of need, so the students mostly left to Prague, Vienna or Kraków. Related to this situation the voices that called for the establishment of university, but not regional one in Olomouc but in the state capital – Brno, grew stronger. The Moravian Germans rejected the second Czech university and thus led to the many quarrels (the settlement occurred after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1919 by the establishment of Masaryk University). In September 1899 the disputes were solved by founding the Imperial Czech Technical University of Franz Joseph in Brno.\n\nIn the beginning the university was settled in Augustine Street and had to make do with 4 professors and 47 students who could study only Civil Engineering. In the following year (1900) the teaching of the field of machine engineering was started and followed by the cultural engineering (landscaping), electrical engineering and chemical engineering. After World War I it was also possible to study architecture. In 1911 the university was moved into a newly built luxurious building in Veveří Street which is still used by the Faculty of Civil Engineering. In the interwar period it was connected with the German Technical University and was renamed the Brno University of Technology. The school has used the name of the University of Technology of Dr. E. Benes for a short time.\n\nAfter the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and installing the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, all Czech universities, including the Czech Technical University, were forced to close \"(see International Students' Day)\". After the end of the war in 1945, the university was restored to its pre-war state, also taking over buildings of the German Technical University in Brno which was closed. After the war the school was reopened under the older name the University of Technology of Dr. E. Benes. The school was ceased to exist in 1951; some parts were transferred to the newly established Military Technical Academy. The only faculties that provided civilian training remained Faculty of Civil Engineering and Architecture Faculty, both under the name College of Engineering. Already in 1956 the university activity was gradually restored under the present name Brno University of Technology. Today's appearance was more or less stabilized in 1961.\n\nAfter 1989 there was a reorganization of certain faculties and the emergence of many new ones. There was restored The Faculty of Chemistry (1992) and in addition to the technical fields, BUT focused on economy (Faculty of Business founded in 1992) and arts (Faculty of Fine Arts, founded in 1993).\n\nAnother milestone is associated with the year 2000 when the BUT separates two faculties deployed in Zlín - Faculty of Technology and Faculty of Management and Economics - and thus established the Tomas Bata University.\nThe most recent significant organizational change is the splitting of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication and the Faculty of Information Technology which occurred in 2002.\n\nMost of the BUT buildings are now located in the area under Palacky Hill in the city district Kralovo Pole. There are the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Business, Faculty of Chemistry and a new building of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication as well as two college campuses.\nFaculty of Information Technology is located in a former Carthusian monastery in Bozetechova Street and in the new complex across the street. The Faculty of Civil Engineering is located in an extensively reconstructed building in the Veveri Street. Faculty of Architecture is located in the Porici Street, Faculty of Fine Arts in the Rybarska Street. BUT also uses the buildings in the Udolni Street and the third college campus in Kounicova Street. Rector's Offices are located in a newly renovated Baroque building in Antoninska Street.\n\nIn the course of more than 110 years BUT has matured into an internationally recognized institution offering education in a broad spectrum of fields ranging from technical and scientific disciplines through economics to the arts.\n\nThe head of the university is the rector who is represented by five prorectors in various fields of activity. Financial matters of BUT are in the hands of the bursar, communication and promotion is the business of the public relations officer in cooperation with the Unit of external relations. Important documents and guidelines are discussed and approved by the Academic Senate which consisted of an employee and a student chamber. Scientific direction of BUT determines the Scientific Council, acting as BUT experts, other universities and industry.\n\nEach of faculty is governed by dean and his vice-deans. Also, the faculties have their academic senates which deal exclusively with the laws of the faculties. Similarly, the faculties have their own scientific council.\nThere are a number of student organizations in BUT, for historical reasons called the Student Unions. Each Faculty has its student chamber which represents students in the Academic Senate - students have the opportunity to participate in the management of their faculty.\n\n\n\nOne of the oldest faculties of Brno University of Technology was established in 1919. During its existence the faculty was merged with the Faculty of civil Engineering. Currently provides training in architecture and urban design and has about three hundred students.\n\nTeaching Chemistry at BUT dates back to 1911 when there was established Department of Chemistry at the Czech Technical University. The development was interrupted in 1951 by converting BUT to the Military Technical Academy. The restoration of the teaching of chemistry was reached in 1992. Faculty realizes bachelor's, master's and doctoral degree programs in chemistry and food industry.\n\nStudying at the faculty is focused on a wide range of scientific areas: control technology and robotics, biomedical engineering, power electronics and electrical engineering, electrotechnology and electronics, microelectronics, radioelectronics and teleinformatics.\n\nAlready in 1964 the department of automatic computers was established in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, lately the institute of informatics detached which was transformed in 2002 into an independent faculty of information technology.\nFIT campus is located in a former Carthusian monastery and the former estate.\n\nThe faculty consists of four institutes:\n\nThe faculty offers two basic levels of study - a three-year bachelor and two-year master's degree program. The third level is the doctoral degree program.\n\nOne of the youngest BUT faculty focuses on the economy and business fields of study. In 1992 the faculty was separated from the original Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. \nBesides bachelor's, master's and doctoral programs in this field the faculty offers in cooperation with foreign universities postgraduate MBA studies. About 3 000 students study management, accounting, corporate finance, taxation and managerial science.\n\nFCE is the oldest faculty of Brno University of Technology and the biggest one with its number of students – 6 500. In 1899 the university started its activities with this branch and that faculty was the only one which survived a violent change - transformation BUT into the Military Technical Academy in 1951.\n\nStudents can study in four programmes in Czech language at this faculty:\n\nand one programme in English language:\n\nThe opening of the engineering department was in 1900 and herewith it is the second oldest faculty of the BUT. In the past there was taught energy branch from which subsequently became an independent faculty of electrical engineering.\n\nThe faculty offers study of:\n\nOn the contrary, one of the youngest BUT faculties is the Faculty of Fine Arts. In 1993 it was founded from the institute of fine arts which was based in the faculty of architecture a year earlier.

It is possible to study The Forensic engineering program as a doctoral study. In preparation is the transformation of the institute to the separate department faculty with the temporary name the Faculty of Forensic Engineering.\n\nIn cooperation with the Faculty of Business CESA provides courses of study in Management of Physical Culture. Students can choose from more than 40 sports like basketball, swimming, athletics, golf or diving.\n\nThe school is a holder of the European Commission ECTS certificates (European Credit Transfer System) - Label and DS (Diploma Supplement) Label for the period 2009-2013, reflecting the appreciation of quality of the university education in keeping with the principles of the Bologna Declaration. ECTS Label supports studying abroad at universities around the world.

The curve had a maximum permitted speed of , but the express had been travelling at more than . The train was completely derailed, and smashed into a milk train and a light engine, killing 28 people.\n\nThe accident occurred at the same time as a short cut of the rival Great Western Railway was opening, and it was claimed that the driver of the crashed train was trying to show that his railway was capable of competitive speeds. It was also rumoured that passengers – mostly rich New Yorkers travelling to London from the transatlantic port at Plymouth – had bribed the driver to run the train as fast as possible, but there was not any evidence of this, and if anything the train had lost time earlier. Conversely, it was stated that drivers often ran through Salisbury very fast on these trains to \"get a run\" at the following hill. The engine was a new LSWR L12 class 4-4-0 with a higher centre of gravity than the earlier T9 class. The most likely cause of the accident is that the driver simply did not realise the level of risk he was running, particularly as this was the first occasion on which he had taken a non-stopping train through Salisbury. Also, steam locomotives at this time, and for half a century afterwards, were not fitted with speedometers.\n\nAs a result of the crash, all trains were required to stop at Salisbury station from that point onwards (the boat train at the time had no passenger stops from Plymouth to London Waterloo, although locomotives were changed at Templecombe). The speed limit on the curve east of Salisbury was also reduced to , a limit still in effect today.\n\nThere is a memorial tablet to the 28 dead (including the driver, two firemen and the guard) in Salisbury Cathedral.\n\nThe accident was the second in a series of three derailments due to excessive speed at night in a 16-month period. The others were at Grantham 1906 and Shrewsbury 1907. All three resulted in deaths, including the footplate crews; the cause in each case was recorded as Driver Error but there has been much speculation since.\n\nIn 2006, historian Frogg Moody organised a memorial service at Salisbury Railway Station.\n\n\n\n\n"}

An estimated 20 supernova explosions have happened within 300 pc of the Earth over the last 11 million years. Type II supernova explosions are expected to occur in active star-forming regions, with 12 such OB associations being located within 650 pc of the Earth. At present, there are six near-Earth supernova candidates within 300 pc.\n\nOn average, a supernova explosion occurs within of the Earth every 240 million years. Gamma rays are responsible for most of the adverse effects a supernova can have on a living terrestrial planet. In Earth's case, gamma rays induce radiolysis of diatomic N and O in the upper atmosphere, converting molecular nitrogen and oxygen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough to expose the surface to harmful solar and cosmic radiation (mainly ultra-violet). Phytoplankton and reef communities would be particularly affected, which could severely deplete the base of the marine food chain.\n\nOdenwald discusses the possible effects of a Betelgeuse supernova on the Earth and on human space travel, especially the effects of the stream of charged particles that would reach the Earth about 100,000 years later than the initial light and other electromagnetic radiation produced by the explosion.\n\nSpeculation as to the effects of a nearby supernova on Earth often focuses on large stars as Type II supernova candidates. Several prominent stars within a few hundred light years of the Sun are candidates for becoming supernovae in as little as a millennium. Although they would be spectacular to look at, were these \"predictable\" supernovae to occur, they are thought to have little potential to affect Earth.\n\nIt is estimated that a Type II supernova closer than eight parsecs (26 light-years) would destroy more than half of the Earth's ozone layer. Such estimates are based on atmospheric modeling and the measured radiation flux from SN 1987A, a Type II supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Estimates of the rate of supernova occurrence within 10 parsecs of the Earth vary from 0.05–0.5 per billion years to 10 per billion years. Several studies assume that supernovae are concentrated in the spiral arms of the galaxy, and that supernova explosions near the Sun usually occur during the approximately 10 million years that the Sun takes to pass through one of these regions. Examples of relatively near supernovae are the Vela Supernova Remnant ( ly, years ago) and Geminga ( ly, years ago).\n\nType Ia supernovae are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the Earth. Because Type Ia supernovae arise from dim, common white dwarf stars, it is likely that a supernova that could affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and take place in a star system that is not well studied. The closest known candidate is IK Pegasi. It is currently estimated, however, that by the time it could become a threat, its velocity in relation to the Solar System would have carried IK Pegasi to a safe distance.\n\nEvidence from daughter products of short-lived radioactive isotopes shows that a nearby supernova helped determine the composition of the Solar System 4.5 billion years ago, and may even have triggered the formation of this system. Supernova production of heavy elements over astronomic periods of time ultimately made the chemistry of life on Earth possible.\n\nPast supernovae might be detectable on Earth in the form of metal isotope signatures in rock strata. Subsequently, iron-60 enrichment has been reported in deep-sea rock of the Pacific Ocean by researchers from the Technical University of Munich. Twenty-three atoms of this iron isotope were found in the top 2 cm of crust (this layer corresponds to times from 13.4 million years ago to the present). It is estimated that the supernova must have occurred in the last 5 million years or else it would have had to happen very close to the solar system to account for so much iron-60 still being here. A supernova occurring so close would have probably caused a mass extinction, which did not happen in that time frame. The quantity of iron seems to indicate that the supernova was less than 30 parsecs away. On the other hand, the authors estimate the frequency of supernovae at a distance less than \"D\" (for reasonably small \"D\") as around (\"D\"/10 pc) per billion years, which gives a probability of only around 5% for a supernova within 30 pc in the last 5 million years. They point out that the probability may be higher because the Solar System is entering the Orion Arm of the Milky Way. In 2019, the group in Munich found interstellar dust in Antarctic surface snow not older than 20 years which they relate to the Local Interstellar Cloud. The detection of interstellar dust in Antarctica was done by the measurement of the radionuclides Fe-60 and Mn-53 by highly sensitive Accelerator mass spectrometry, where Fe-60 is again the clear signature for a recent near-Earth supernova origin.\n\nGamma ray bursts from \"dangerously close\" supernova explosions occur two or more times per billion years, and this has been proposed as the cause of the end Ordovician extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.\n\nIn 1998 a supernova remnant, RX J0852.0-4622, was found in front (apparently) of the larger Vela Supernova Remnant. Gamma rays from the decay of titanium-44 (half-life about 60 years) were independently discovered emanating from it, showing that it must have exploded fairly recently (perhaps around the year 1200), but there is no historical record of it. The flux of gamma rays and X-rays indicates that the supernova was relatively close to us (perhaps 200 parsecs or 660 ly). If so, this is an unexpected event because supernovae less than 200 parsecs away are estimated to occur less than once per 100,000 years.\n\n"}

He served as CEO of AlliedSignal (later Honeywell) in the 1990s, prior to which he spent more than 30 years rising through executive positions at General Electric.\n\nBossidy was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on March 5, 1935, and has a twin brother, Tom Bossidy. Bossidy worked at the family shoe store growing up, had dreams of being a Major League Baseball pitcher, and once had a summer job of pitching baseball for a college league team in Quebec, Canada. When Bossidy was a senior in high school he had a 95+ mph fastball, and a scout offered Bossidy a $40,000 contract to pitch for the Detroit Tigers. However, when the scout came to Bossidy's house with a check, Bossidy's mother wouldn't let him in the house, insisting that Bossidy finish his studies at Colgate University. While at Colgate, he helped lead them to the 1955 College World Series; in 2009, Bossidy was inducted into their sports hall of fame.\n\nBossidy graduated from Colgate in 1957 with a B.A. in economics. He was a member of the Mu chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Colgate. Bossidy was later conferred a Doctorate of Humane Letters from Colgate.\n\nBossidy joined General Electric in 1957. Bossidy started out in General Electric's financial training program.\nHe stayed with General Electric for the next 34 years, rising in the company through a number of executive positions including chief operating officer of General Electric Credit Corporation from 1979 to 1981, Executive Vice President and President of GE's Services and Materials Sector from 1981 to 1984, and vice-chairman and Executive Officer of the General Electric Company from 1984 to 1991.\n\nOne of his most important jobs at General Electric was as chief operating officer of General Electric Credit Corporation from 1979 to 1981. During Bossidy's tenure as head of General Electric Credit Corporation, the subsidiary, founded in 1943, came into its own. Between 1979 and 1984, its assets doubled, to $16 billion, due to expansion into leasing and selling of heavy industrial goods, inventories, real estate, and insurance. The leasing operations also provided General Electric with tax shelters from accelerated depreciation on equipment that GE developed that were then leased by the credit corporation. Dennis Dammerman worked for Bossidy at GE Credit and remembered that Bossidy \"could be boisterous and a little unsettling to the insecure. He challenged everything, If you couldn't back up what you said, look out. But he also challenges himself.\"\n\nBossidy had a long term business relationship with General Electric CEO Jack Welch that began in the late 1960s when Bossidy came to audit GE's plastics division where Welch worked at the time. Bossidy later worked for Welch when Welch became CEO at General Electric. \"Larry is a quick thinker, who energizes others around him. When he gets behind an idea, he lights up a room,\" says Welch. \"He has both the mental toughness as well as the broad perspective that is necessary to lead and deliver results.\"\n\nBefore joining AlliedSignal, Bossidy was a high level executive at GE. He was very close to GE CEO Jack Welch but left for Allied Signal because he was too close in age to Welch to be considered as his successor (GE has a mandatory 65-year retirement age for its CEOs so somebody who is not a good ten years younger at the time of a CEO change would not be considered for the job).\n\nFrom 1991 to 1999, Bossidy served as chairman and CEO of AlliedSignal Corporation. He became Chairman of Honeywell Corporation when Honeywell was acquired by AlliedSignal in 1999. Allied Signal, well-known in the aerospace, aviation, and military industries adopted the Honeywell name, as Honeywell's product diversity provided greater notoriety in the consumer market. Bossidy retired in April 2000, then returned in July 2001, following an unsuccessful effort by General Electric to acquire Honeywell; he again retired from Honeywell in 2002.\n\nBossidy served as Chairman of The Business Council in 1997 and 1998. In 2002, he co-authored, with business consultant Ram Charan, the best-selling book \"Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done\", and a follow-on book in 2004. Bossidy was a director of the pharmaceutical company Merck from 1992 until April 2007.\n\nBossidy married Nancy Bossidy in 1956. The Bossidys have six daughters and three sons and thirty-one grandchildren. Bossidy lives in Ridgefield, Connecticut, and has a winter home in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nBossidy's favorite author is James Joyce.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1870720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870720", "title": "Sepia Mutiny", "text": "Sepia Mutiny\n\nSepia Mutiny was a blog and discussion forum, initially conceived by a group of mostly second generation Indian American students and young professionals in August 2004. The site had had an exponential growth rate and according to its FAQ, as of May 2007 had amassed over five million readers since inception. The majority of the posts on the site were authored by its founding bloggers, though many posts were also authored by \"regular contributors.\" The site also functioned as a public forum on South Asian issues and boasted a wide range of commenters hailing from diverse geographic locations, although predominantly the United States and England. On March 15, 2012, the site announced its closure starting April 1, 2012, citing diversified evolution of blogosphere and personal engagements of its writers as reasons for shutting down.\n\nThe title is a pun on the Sepoy Mutiny, or First War of Indian Independence in 1857, a violent widespread movement by sepoys against the British Raj during the latter's imperialist rule in India. Sepia, a shade of brown, was intended as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the tone of South Asian skin.\n\nSepia Mutiny discussed issues facing first and second generation immigrants from the Indian subcontinent. The goal of the site was in effect to capture the position of the Indian-American diaspora as it emigrates to foreign nations and primarily North America. Sepia Mutiny had become a focal point of discussion for Desis on the Internet in the United States and, to some extent, other parts of the South Asian diaspora.\n\nSepia Mutiny's emergence was part of the increase in mainstream diasporic Desi writing and creative arts outside the traditional genres — the effects of which can be seen in Indian subcontinent and spills over to the America, Canada, and the United Kingdom, given the presence of Desis. A similar trend was seen at sites like Badmash, an online comic that gained notice for its Amitabh for President campaign, South Asian magazines such as ABCDlady, as well as the greater prominence of Bollywood films in the United States. Crossovers movies such as \"Bride and Prejudice\", \"Bollywood/Hollywood\" and \"Monsoon Wedding\" have helped the western audience understand the desi culture. The blog also addressed the growing prominence of South Asian Americans like Bobby Jindal, Russell Peters, Sanjay Gupta, Neel Kashkari and Kal Penn, among others, as they enter the mainstream of American culture.\n\nPart of the focus of Sepia Mutiny was to bring attention to the expanding involvement of South Asian Americans as a political body in the United States, especially in the 2004 and 2006 congressional and presidential elections. A lot of attention was given to the controversy surrounding Virginia United States Senate election, 2006, a scandal that erupted due to comments by former Republican Senator for Virginia, George Allen, in which he used the word macaca to refer to S.R. Sidarth, an Indian American aide working for his opponent's Senatorial campaign. Sepia Mutiny also drew attention to other public figures in America who have used racial slurs against Indians in the past such as Vice-President Joe Biden and major radio personalities in Philadelphia and New York City.\n\nThe bloggers at Sepia Mutiny often focused on the emergence of Indian-Americans in the Western political structure. The site served as fertile ground for discussion regarding the actions of these politicians in the United States, ranging from Bobby Jindal to Nikki Haley to Shahid Malik.\n\nAnother focus of the blog had been to highlight violence against South Asians — a phenomenon which has become more common since the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. The site, however, broadened its awareness of violence beyond simple hate crimes. The recent tragedy at Virginia Tech was discussed from a South Asian perspective with posts about South Asian shooting victims Professor G. V. Loganathan and student Minal \"Minu\" Panchal, victims the mainstream media failed to talk in depth about. They also were one of the few media sources that addressed the recent assault of a young Indian American National Lawyer's Guild observer Sanjukta Paul during the Los Angeles May Day Mêlée at MacArthur Park by a member of the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nIn the spring and summer of 2006, a number of Sepia Mutiny posts debated the allegations of plagiarism in Kaavya Viswanathan's novel, \"How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life\". Posts related to Viswanathan were widely cited by other blogs and the mass-media, including \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\". The site has also highlighted South Asian authors that have come to attention in the United States and abroad, including Booker Prize winners Salman Rushdie and Kiran Desai, and Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Jhumpa Lahiri.\n\nThere was considerable discussion about South Asians in the music industry, ranging from recent Bollywood soundtracks to mainstream Western musicians, such as recent \"American Idol\" contestant Sanjaya Malakar. The site also provides coverage of the long history in the music industry of fusing Eastern and Western styles of music, as can be seen through the work of artists like Panjabi MC, Raghav, and Talvin Singh, and unique new niche genres such as Desi Ska and Hindu Rock.\n\nIn addition Indian American film and television were highlighted on the blog. Be it mainstream releases to American audiences like Harold and Kumar, Salaam Bombay, and the Elements Trilogy, or lesser known work such as the cult-classic American Desi, Sepia Mutiny bloggers covered it.\n\nIn addition to being aware of issues faced by South Asians outside of India, Sepia Mutiny was also cognizant of current events within the subcontinent as well. Many posts discuss current events in India, including controversial topics such as terrorism, communal tensions, AIDS, and even the rapid evolution of the Bollywood film industry. Sepia Mutiny's comprehensive international awareness served to highlight that the changing South Asian culture in the Western world is often mirrored by reciprocal evolution on the Indian subcontinent itself.\n"}

The cord provides a path that allows the fistula to drain continuously while it is healing, rather than allowing the exterior of the wound to close over. Keeping the fistula tract open can help prevent the trapping of pus or other infectious material in the wound. The procedure was mentioned by Hippocrates.\n\nSetons can be tied tightly or loosely and with different materials, depending on the anatomical location of the fistulae and what may be medically required. A seton might be tied loosely as a palliative measure to avoid septic and painful exacerbations, or as temporary measure before surgical excision as in fistulotomy or fistulectomy. In some types of fistulae, a seton may be tied with more tension and tightened periodically. In this case, the seton loop will slowly cut through tissue inside the loop while scarring behind the loop, essentially \"pulling out\" the fistula without surgery. This is the Kshar-Sutra method mentioned by Sushruta in ancient Indian surgical practice.\n"}

{"id": "1870763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870763", "title": "Shinbutsu bunri", "text": "Shinbutsu bunri\n\nThe Japanese term indicates the separation of Shinto from Buddhism, introduced after the Meiji Restoration which separated Shinto \"kami\" from buddhas, and also Buddhist temples from Shinto shrines, which were originally amalgamated. It is a yojijukugo phrase.\n\nUntil the end of the Edo period, in 1868, Shinto and Buddhism were intimately connected in what was called \"shinbutsu-shūgō\" (神仏習合), to the point that the same buildings were often used as both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, and Shinto gods were interpreted as manifestations of Buddhas. However, the tendency to oppose Buddhism as a foreign import and to uphold Shinto as the native religion can be seen already during the early modern era, partly as a nationalistic reaction. In a broad sense, the term \"shinbutsu bunri\" indicates the effects of the anti-Buddhist movement that, from the middle of the Edo period onwards, accompanied the spread of Confucianism, the growth of studies of ancient Japanese literature and culture (\"kokugaku)\", and the rise of Shinto-based nationalism, All these movements had reasons to oppose Buddhism.\n\nIn a narrower sense, \"shinbutsu bunri\" refers to the policy of separating Shinto and Buddhism pursued by the new Meiji government with the of 1868. This order triggered the \"haibutsu kishaku\", a violent anti-Buddhist movement that caused the forcible closure of thousands of temples, the confiscation of their land, the forced return of many monks to lay life or their transformation into Shinto priests, and the destruction of numerous books, statues and other Buddhist artefacts. Even bronze bells were melted down to make cannons. However, the process of separation stalled by 1873, the government's intervention in support of the order was relaxed, and even today the separation is still only partially complete: many major Buddhist temples retain small shrines dedicated to tutelary Shinto \"kami\", and some Buddhist figures, such as the goddess Kannon, are revered in Shinto shrines. The policy failed in its short-term aims and was ultimately abandoned, but it was successful in the long term in creating a new religious status quo in which Shinto and Buddhism are perceived as different and independent.\n\nThe new government that seized power in 1868 saw \"shinbutsu bunri\" as a way to reduce the immense wealth and power of the Buddhist sects. At the same time, it was supposed to give Shinto, and especially its cult of the Emperor, time to grow into an effective vehicle for nationalism.\n\nA first order issued by the Jinguji Muka in April 1868 ordered the defrocking of \"shasō\" and \"bettō\" (shrine monks performing Buddhist rites at Shinto shrines).\n\nA few days later, the Daijōkan banned the application of Buddhist terminology such as \"gongen\" to Japanese \"kami\" and the veneration of Buddhist statues in shrines.\n\nNext came a ban on applying the Buddhist term \"Daibosatsu\" (Great Bodhisattva) to the syncretic \"kami\" Hachiman at the Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū and Usa Hachiman-gū shrines.\n\nIn the final stage, all the defrocked \"bettō\" and \"shasō\" were told to become \"shrine priests\" (\"kannushi\") and return to their shrines. Also, monks of the Nichiren sect were told not to refer to some deities as \"kami\".\n\nThe campaign ultimately failed to destroy the influence of Buddhism on the Japanese people, who still needed funerals, graves and ancestral rites, all services traditionally provided by Buddhism. The state's first attempt to influence religious life therefore resulted in failure. In 1873, the government admitted that the effort to elevate Shinto above Buddhism had failed. However, the government did cause the diffusion of the idea that Shinto was the true religion of the Japanese, finally revealed after remaining for a long time hidden behind Buddhism.\n\nIn recent years, many historians have come to believe that the syncretism of \"kami\" and Buddhas (shinbutsu-shūgō) was just as authentically Japanese. The government was successful in creating the impression that Shinto and Buddhism in Japan are completely independent religions. Most Japanese today are unaware that some of their customary religious practices cannot be understood outside the context of the syncretism of kami and Buddhas. In discussing some Japanese Buddhist temples dedicated to the cult of \"kami\" Inari, Shinto scholar Karen Smyers comments:\n\nAlthough the government did not explicitly order the closing of temples, the destruction of Buddhist property or the defrocking of Buddhist priests and nuns, they were often interpreted as implying it, and the \"haibutsu kishaku\" movement soon spread across the country. The \"shinbutsu bunri\" policy was itself the direct cause of serious damage to important cultural properties. Because mixing the two religions was now forbidden, shrines and temples had to give away some of their treasures. For example, the giant , wooden statues of guardian beings, at the entrance of the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū, a shrine in Kamakura, were objects of Buddhist worship and therefore illegal where they were, so they were sold to Jufuku-ji, where they still stand today. The shrine also had to destroy Buddhism-related buildings, for example its \"tahōtō\" tower, its , and its . Many Buddhist temples were simply closed, for example Zenkō-ji, to which the now-independent Meigetsu-in used to belong.\n\nAnother consequence of the policy was the creation of so-called \"invented traditions\". To avoid the destruction of material illegal under the new rules, Shinto and Buddhist priests invented traditions, genealogies and other information that justified its presence. Later, awareness of their origin was often lost, causing considerable confusion among historians.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1870789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870789", "title": "Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia", "text": "Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia\n\nThe Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia is a Christian denomination with its origins in Wesleyan Methodism. It is the organisational name for contemporary The Wesleyan Church in Australia. (The historic Wesleyan Methodist denomination in Australia up to 1 January 1902 merged into the Methodist Church of Australasia.)\n\nThe beginnings of the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Australia may be traced to 1945, when the Rev. Dr. Kingsley Ridgway offered himself as a Melbourne based \"field representative\" for a possible Australian branch of the Wesleyan Methodist Church of America, after meeting an American serviceman who was a member of that denomination.\n\nKingsley Ridgway's legacy continued to be felt in the church, with his son, the Rev. Dr. James Ridgway, providing denominational and institutional leadership over many years, and grandson the Rev. Kent Ridgway serving as Southern District Superintendent.\n\nContrary to a popular assumption, it is not a \"continuing Methodist Church,\" formed as a result of the merger in 1977 of Congregationalist, Methodist and Presbyterian congregations to form the Uniting Church in Australia. It was never a part of the merger negotiations with those bodies that formed the Uniting Church, though some members and ministers, unhappy with the Basis of Union, switched allegiance to the Wesleyans.\n\nThe Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia saw increased growth in the 1980s, particularly in Queensland , much of this as a result of the church planting strategies of the Rev. Don Hardgrave , who also wrote the only denominational history of the church. As well as aiming at new convert growth, Wesleyan Methodists have welcomed into their membership those seeking an alternative to more liberal Protestant denominations, as well as Pentecostals looking for a church more grounded in historic Christianity. The 45th National Conference held in January 2004 reported 77 local churches, 96 ordained ministers, 2017 members and an average main Sunday service attendance of 3702 persons.\n\nFrom the late 1990s, the Australian church has fostered and encouraged the emergence of Wesleyan Methodist churches in New Zealand, the Solomon Islands, and Bougainville, Papua New Guinea.\n\nAt the 2008 South Pacific Convention and National Conference held at Philip Island, Victoria, a new National Superintendent was appointed, Rev. Lindsay Cameron. Lindsay brought to the position a desire to see the denomination strengthened through the upholding and proclamation of the uniqueness of Wesleyan doctrinal teaching.\n\nThe 2012 National Conference elected the Rev. Rex Rigby to the position of National Superintendent. He is the denomination's first indigenous leader.\n\nThe church is theologically conservative, Arminian in theology and typically non-charismatic. It appreciates both its revivalist and holiness heritage as well as its roots in John Wesley's Anglicanism. Along with Nazarenes and the Salvation Army, it has a strong commitment to the ordination of women, a position that in part arises out of its interpretive approach to the Bible and in part out of its revivalist heritage.\n\nHistorically, the church may be seen both as a new religious movement, emerging out of the post-war context of greater engagement between Australians and Americans and at the same time as a continuation of the long-standing Holiness and Revivalist strain within Australian evangelicalism.\n\nThe associated Kingsley College, Melbourne provides a ministry training program that offers four awards from Certificate IV to Graduate Certificate. Kingsley College delivers training under the auspices of Unity College Australia RTO 6330. Kingsley College has been the ministry training arm of the Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia since 1949. That training of lay people and ministerial candidates continues through Kingsley Community training centres located around Australia. \n"}

In 2001, its mandate was expanded to include terrorism financing. \n\nThe objectives of FATF are to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. FATF is a “policy-making body” that works to generate the necessary political will to bring about national legislative and regulatory reforms in these areas. FATF monitors progress in implementing its Recommendations through \"peer reviews\" (\"mutual evaluations\") of member countries.\n\nSince 2000, FATF has maintained the FATF blacklist (formally called the \"Call for action\") and the FATF greylist (formally called the \"Other monitored jurisdictions\").\n\nFATF was formed by the 1989 G7 Summit in Paris to combat the growing problem of money laundering. The task force was charged with studying money laundering trends, monitoring legislative, financial and law enforcement activities taken at the national and international level, reporting on compliance, and issuing recommendations and standards to combat money laundering. At the time of its formation, FATF had 16 members, which by 2016 had grown to 37.\n\nIn its first year, FATF issued a report containing forty recommendations to more effectively fight money laundering. These standards were revised in 2003 to reflect evolving patterns and techniques in money laundering.\n\nThe mandate of the organisation was expanded in 2001 to include terrorist financing following the September 11 terror attacks.\n\nThe FATF Secretariat is located at the OECD headquarters in Paris. \n\nSince November 2015, the FATF Secretariat has been led by the Executive Secretary David Lewis.\n\nTogether, the Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and eight (now nine) Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts. They set out the principles for action and allow countries a measure of flexibility in implementing these principles according to their particular circumstances and constitutional frameworks. Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures. There are multiple groups to organize the Recommendations; AML/CFT Policies and Coordination, Money Laundering and Confiscation, Terrorist Financing and Financial of Proliferation, Preventive Measures, Transparency and Beneficial Ownership of Legal Persons and Arrangements, Powers and Responsibilities of Competent Authorities and other Institutional Measures, and International Cooperation.\n\nIn February 2012, the FATF codified its recommendations and Interpretive Notes into one document that maintains SR VIII (renamed “Recommendation 8”), and also includes new rules on weapons of mass destruction, corruption and wire transfers (“Recommendation 16”).\n\nThe FATF's Forty Recommendations on money laundering of 1990 are the primary policies issued by FATF and the Nine Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF). The Recommendations are seen globally as the world standard in anti-money laundering as well many countries have made a commitment to put the Forty Recommendations in place. The Recommendations cover the criminal justice system and law enforcement, international co-operation, and the financial system and its regulation. The FATF completely revised the Forty Recommendations in 1996 and 2003. By 1996 the Recommendations had to be updated to include more than just drug-money laundering, as well as to keep up with changing techniques. The 2003 Forty Recommendations require states, among other things, to:\n\nThe FATF has issued Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. In October 2001 the FATF issued the original eight Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing, following the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Among the measures, \"Special Recommendation VIII\" (SR VIII) specifically targeted nonprofit organizations. This was followed by the International Best Practices Combating the Abuse of Non-Profit Organizations in 2002, released one month before the U.S. Department of Treasury's Anti-Terrorist Financing Guidelines, and the Interpretive Note for SR VIII in 2006. A ninth Special Recommendation was added later. In 2003 the Recommendations, as well as the 9 Special Recommendations were adjusted for the second time. The Recommendations, and Special Recommendations were advocated by over 180 countries.\n\nIn February 2004 (Updated as of February 2009) the FATF published a reference document Methodology for Assessing Compliance with the FATF 40 Recommendations and the FATF 9 Special Recommendations. The 2009 Handbook for Countries and Assessors outlines criteria for evaluating whether FATF standards are achieved in participating countries. FATF evaluates a country’s performance based on its assessment methodology that covers: 1. technical compliance, which is about legal and institutional framework and the powers and procedures of the competent authorities, and 2. effectiveness assessment, which is about the extent to which the legal and institutional framework is producing the expected results.\n\nThere are many differences between countries dealing with their legal and financial system, which is taking into consideration by the FATF. There is a set minimum of actions that meet a standard, that all countries can use regarding their own situation. This standard covers all actions that a nation should take within their regulatory systems and their criminal justice systems as well the preventive measures that should be taken by specified businesses, professions, and institutions.\n\nFor Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) there has been a command for more financial transparency, to make sure that they do not become easier for terrorist organizations to launder money through the organizations. This hypothesis was thought of by intergovernmental organizations. These intergovernmental organizations include the World Bank, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Non-Profit Organizations are put under surveillance, especially when they are associated with \"suspect communities\" or if they are based or working in zones of conflict.\n\nIn addition to FATF's \"Forty plus Nine\" Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of \"Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories\" (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist. This was a list of 15 jurisdictions that, for one reason or another, FATF members believed were uncooperative with other jurisdictions in international efforts against money laundering (and, later, terrorism financing). Typically, this lack of cooperation manifested itself as an unwillingness or inability (frequently, a legal inability) to provide foreign law enforcement officials with information relating to bank account and brokerage records, and customer identification and beneficial owner information relating to such bank and brokerage accounts, shell company, and other financial vehicles commonly used in money laundering. As of October 2006, there are no Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories in the context of the NCCT initiative. However FATF issues updates as countries on High-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions list have made significant improvements in standards and cooperation. The FATF also issues updates to identify additional jurisdictions that pose Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing risks.\n\nThe FATF surveyed 26 jurisdictions to check their ability and willingness to co-operate with other countries in the international fight against money laundering. The Review contained the summaries of these surveys. Fifteen jurisdictions were branded “non-cooperative countries or territories,” because of the high number of harmful practices identified in these jurisdictions.\n\nAs of June 2019 there are 37 member countries of FATF. Starting with its own members, the FATF monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations; reviews money laundering and terrorist financing techniques and counter-measures; and, promotes the adoption and implementation of the FATF Recommendations globally. Countries are subjected to evaluation by FATF to see that they are upholding laws and regulations enforced by FATF.\n\n FATF had 39 full members, comprising 37 member jurisdictions and two regional organisations. The FATF also works in close co-operation with a number of international and regional bodies involved in combating money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\n FATF had 8 associated FATF style regional members, that have similar objectives of setting up systems to fight terrorism and money corruption::\nMembers of the FATF regional bodies that are not full FATF members are entitled to attend FATF meetings as individual member-delegates of the regional bodies and to intervene on policy and operational issues.\n\n30 countries and international organisations are observer organisations. These include the International Monetary Fund, the UN with six expert groups and the World Bank.\n\nIndonesia joined the group of observers that take part in upholding law against money laundering, terrorism and illegal funding. The international organisations recorded have, among other objectives, a specific anti-money laundering aim or function.\nThere are still compliance issues in areas that might afford exploitative opportunities for transnational crime and terrorist networks. This can have detrimental effects on a country's national security through increasing risks of money laundering and financing of terrorism as well as wastage due to the implementation of inappropriate regulatory measures. The objective is to increase mitigation strategies that would enable scarce resources in fighting money laundering and terrorism financing threats.\n\nThe FATF follows strict criteria to identify potential threats.\n\nThe effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.\n\nThe FATF began to become a big figure shortly after the 9/11 attacks to help combat the financing of terrorist organizations. FATF makes sure funds are not easily accessible by terror organizations that are causing these crimes against humanity. FATF has helped to fight against corruption by ‘grey-listing’ countries that do not meet Recommended Criteria and this helps to cripple economies and states that are aiding terrorist and corrupted organizations. FATF continues to work with other monetary agencies to control terrorist finance activity and to bring an end to illegal financial organizations, terrorism and corruption.\n\nFATF has made it difficult for NGOs in countries to access funds to aid in relief situations due to strict FATF criteria. FATF criteria have mainly impacted NGOs that are located in Middle Eastern and terror-ridden countries. Some argue that the FATF Recommendations do not specifically set out restrictions for NGOs which often results in them going against FATF Recommendation.\n\nFATF also has associated FATF style regional bodies, including:\nGABAC (Central Africa)\n\n\n\n"}

He was kayfabe fired the next night for his actions. This was later revealed as a ploy to keep Bryan away from the title. Armstrong made another appearance at Battleground, being the second referee of the Bryan-Orton match after the first referee was knocked out, before himself being knocked out by Big Show. Armstrong returned at the main event of WrestleMania XXX, where he was recruited by The Authority to screw Bryan out of the championship, but was kicked out of the ring by Daniel Bryan. At Survivor Series, he was sent by Triple H to replace the knocked out referee, but was struck down by the debuting Sting. Afterwards, he didn't appear at WWE programming until the January 4, 2016, edition of \"Raw\", where he tried to help Sheamus win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Roman Reigns while the guest referee, Vince McMahon, was knocked out.\n\nOn April 15, 2020, Armstrong was furloughed from the WWE along with several other producers due to the COVID-19 cutbacks. The furlough is expected to end on July 1, 2020. \n\nJames is married to Michelle and has two children.

It ran originally from the town of St Helens to the area which would later develop into the town of Widnes. Branches were opened to Garston, Warrington and Rainford. The company was taken over by the London and North Western Railway in 1864. The line from St Helens to Widnes and the branch to Rainford are now closed, the latter terminating at the Pilkington Glass' Cowley Hill works siding near Gerard's Bridge, but part of the lines to Garston and to Warrington are still in operation.\n\nWith the coming of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century there was a need for coal to be carried from the coalfields in the area of St Helens to the River Mersey for transportation to the growing industrial towns and cities. The first solution was to build the Sankey Canal which opened in 1755 and ran from the Blackbrook canal via Parr to Sankey Bridges, to the west of Warrington. It was extended to the west, to Fiddlers Ferry, five years later. Encouraged by the success of the Stockton and Darlington Railway which opened in 1825, in 1829 a group of local businessmen arranged for a survey for a line from Cowley Hill Colliery, north of St Helens, to Runcorn Gap on the River Mersey. At this time the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which ran to the south of St Helens, was being built and its surveyor, Charles Blacker Vignoles, was commissioned to undertake the survey; he was later appointed as the engineer. An Act of Parliament was obtained on 29 May 1830. The original capital was £120,000, one-third of which was raised from local coal owners, salt-makers and Liverpool merchants. These included James Muspratt, soap and alkali manufacturer, and Peter Greenall, who had interests in the brewing, coal and glass manufacturing industries. Peter Greenall was elected as the first chairman of a board of ten directors. At the south end of the railway, Widnes Dock was built, which led into the Mersey. This was the world's first rail-to-ship facility. Because of perceived competition from the railway, the Sankey Canal was extended from Fiddlers Ferry to Runcorn Gap by what was known as the \"New Cut\". The railway terminated between the dock and the end of the canal and Runcorn Gap station was sited to the north of the canal.\n\nWork on the line proceeded slowly and its costs overran the estimate. It did not open until 1833 but in November 1832 a train with coal wagons ran over the track because of a wager between one of the owners and the engineer that a train would pass over it by December 1832. The line opened officially on 21 February 1833 but the dock was not completed until August 1833. The extension to the Sankey Canal opened on 24 July 1833. From Widnes Dock a single line crossed the extension to the canal by a swing bridge and then climbed steeply, so steeply that for a section trains had to be pulled by a stationary engine. Haulage by a stationary engine was also necessary for a section further north at Sutton near St Helens. The Liverpool and Manchester line was crossed by an iron bridge south of St Helens. The line was originally intended for freight but public demand led to passenger coaches being added to the rear of the trains, this service starting in September 1833. There was intense competition between the railway and the canal leading to financial difficulties for both companies; the canal company had reduced its dividends from 33.3% to 5.5% and the railway company was paying no dividend. The companies agreed to a merger, with the railway company buying out the canal company to form the St Helens Canal and Railway Company (SHCR). Royal assent for this was received on 21 July 1845. The company, which owned nine-second-hand tank engines and had a staff of 122, was described as being \"ramshackle\". It set about to improve the situation, doubling the track and easing the gradients so that the whole line could be operated by steam locomotives.\n\nThe new company then set about planning branch lines and connections. There had been a plan to build northwards from St Helens towards Southport to join the Southport and Euxton branch at Rufford. However this line was built only as far as Rainford. Here it joined the Lancashire Union Railway at Gerards Bridge Junction. The company bought land at Garston with the intention of building a dock and linking it with a line to Runcorn Gap. This opened as a single line on 1 July 1852, although the dock was not opened to shipping until 21 July 1853. On 21 May 1851 a sharp curve connection had been made on this line from the main line at what was to become known as Widnes Dock Junction. The following year a new Runcorn Gap station was opened nearer to the rapidly growing town of Widnes. The next project was to build a branch line to Warrington. This was opened on 1 February 1853, extending to a temporary station at White Cross, Warrington. In the following year it was extended to meet the Warrington and Stockport Railway. A station on this branch was opened at Cuerdley but this closed in January 1858. The creation of these branch lines created an unusual feature on British railways, a flat crossing. In the 1860s people could travel eastwards from Runcorn Gap to Warrington and, from there, to Manchester, London and many other places. They could also travel west to Liverpool by taking a ship at Garston.\n\nBy 1860 there was considerable competition between the railway companies. The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) wanted to build a line between Edge Hill and Garston. Following discussions, the LNWR leased the line from Garston to Warrington with effect from 1 September 1860, paying £5,000 for the first year and £12,000 annually from 1861. On 29 July 1864, an act was passed which allowed SHCR to be absorbed by LNWR, and the transfer took place on 31 July 1864. Runcorn Gap station was renamed Widnes station on 1 September 1864.\n\nWidnes Dock Junction and the flat crossing were causing problems of congestion and the LNWR dealt with this by building a deviation line of just under to the north of the original west–east line, crossing the line leading north to St Helens by a bridge. The deviation line was authorised on 5 July 1865 and opened on 1 November 1869. The line was connected to the St Helens and it included a new station for passengers. With the opening of the line from Weaver Junction across the Mersey on Runcorn Railway Bridge to Ditton Junction, west of Widnes, the Garston extension became part of the Liverpool-London main line. Following the merger of most of Britain's railways into four private companies in 1923, the line from St Helens to Widnes became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). Large quantities of freight were carried on the line and the passenger train from St Helen's to Ditton Junction station was nicknamed the \"Ditton Dodger\".\n\nFollowing the end of the Second World War passenger traffic declined and the service provided by the \"Ditton Dodger\" ended on 16 June 1951. Freight traffic initially continued to be heavy but it declined during the 1960s. In 1969 the line north from Farnworth and Bold station was singled and in 1975 the line south of the station was also singled. The line closed to through traffic on 1 November 1981. The track has been lifted and some of the southern part of the route is occupied by Watkinson Way, a road providing an easterly bypass for Widnes and connecting the Silver Jubilee Bridge with the M62 motorway. The base of the swing bridge which carried the railway over the canal is still present in Spike Island.\n\nAs of 2009, where the line runs near the St Helens Retail Park, the embankment has been reinforced and is said to be for a rail link for visitors from out of town to the new Saints RLFC stadium. It is also rumoured that the track on Robins Lane will be relaid to connect through to St Helens Junction.\n\nWork is close to completion in 2014 to reclaim the section of the railway that ran from Clock Face to Farnworth and Bold as a footpath for walkers and cyclists. Drainage and the majority of the new footpath has now been laid for the public and is already accessible. The footpath can now be enjoyed as part of the reclaimed Sutton Manor Colliery and Jaume Plensa's Dream monument, winner of Channels 4's 'The Big Art Project'.\n\nThis is not a complete list:\n\n\nCitations\nSources\n\n"}

Passengers were carried from 1831. The railway operated independently until 1845 when it became part of the Grand Junction Railway.\nBolton was situated on the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal and Leigh straddled a major east-west canal route, to the west ran the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and joined to it in the center of Leigh was the Bridgewater Canal running east. The canals provided freight routes to both Liverpool and Manchester.\n\nThe canals of the time were the major freight routes being faster and able to transport greater loads than the carriers using the turnpike road system. But, unfortunately, these canal routes were slow, becoming congested, and increasingly more expensive as demand from the rapidly expanding businesses in the area increased. The waterways had a virtual monopoly on the transport links which enabled them to charge exorbitant tolls.\n\nAs costs rose it was no wonder that business leaders and industrialists began to look for another means of transporting their goods and products. They looked to the railway to break this monopoly, the canal companies recognised this threat to their business early on, for example, the Leeds and Liverpool canal company minutes of 21 September 1822 mention the issue, and the canal businesses started to take steps to protect their interests.\n\nRail roads, tramroads and railways had been around for some time, mainly used to transport goods, especially coal to the canal network. There was already at least one private railway operating in the area, in 1812 Robert Daglish had constructed a railway to carry coal from Orrell Colliery in Winstanley, near Wigan to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, this railway used \"Blenkinsop and Murrays\" patent cog and rack steam locomotives to haul the coal wagons. A little further north the Lancaster Canal had been built in two sections joined together in 1797 by a five mile long tramroad.\n\nSometime before 1 October 1824 a committee was formed by local businessmen, including William Hulton, Benjamin Hick and Peter Rothwell to promote a railway in the area. The committee is first recorded on that date as requiring its 63 members to pay money into a bank for the \"making of a railway or railways or tram road from Bolton to the Leeds and Liverpool canal...\"\n\nSeveral routes were proposed and the committee contacted the pioneering railway engineer George Stephenson for his views on the scheme. Stephenson was familiar with the area as he was in the process of surveying the route of the future Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR). Stephenson's response was to commission another engineer, Hugh Steel, to conduct a survey of the viable routes for the railway. Hugh had worked with Stephenson as a surveyor on the L&MR, Steel was assisted in the survey by Robert Daglish. The plans for the line reflected current railway engineering practice in the north-east of England, where Stephenson came from, by including inclined planes which would require cable haulage by stationary engines. Steel's proposed line was approved by Stephenson and accepted by the committee.\n\nThe committee had decided that if they tried to cross the canal at Leigh, with the ultimate aim of making a connection to the proposed Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR), they would create so much opposition that their Parliamentary Bill could fail. There was little precedent for approving railways, there was a reluctance from local landowners to have railways on or near their property and the canal companies were very influential. The committee decided to put forth a bill they thought could pass rather than one with a much higher risk of failing.\n\nTowards the end of 1824 the Bill was presented to Parliament together with Steel's survey and an estimated construction cost of £43,143 (equivalent to £ in ).\n\nThe Bill had considerable opposition in Parliament but the Act received its assent on 31 March 1825 after clauses had been inserted refusing permission to cross the canal, effectively making the railway little more than a canal feeder. The committee could take some satisfaction in its caution as the Liverpool and Manchester Bill was lost that same year.\n\nThis first Act authorised the company to raise the sum of £44,000, via the sale of 440 shares in the company, valued at £100. The railway was to be a single track with two rope worked inclines using stationary steam engines, to run from Lecturers Closes at Bolton to the Leeds and Liverpool canal at Leigh.\n\nIn 1826 work began on the construction of the railway starting from Bolton levelling the ground for the line up to Chequerbent under the supervision of local engineer, Robert Daglish.\n\nThe B&LR found it needed to revise some of the clauses set out in the original Act and they prepared a second Bill in 1828. The second Act received assent on 26 March 1828. This Act enlarged the company's powers, and it authorised the raising of an additional £25,000 to meet the increased costs of construction as well as specifying the track gauge for the railway as being between the inside edges of the rails, as well as between the outside edges. Sometime after this the line became a standard gauge line at .\n\nThe Acts for the B&LR also authorised branch lines at the Bolton end, to the Union Foundry on Deansgate, to William Hulton's coal yard at Great Moor Street and to the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal. The branch to the canal was never built and the branches to Great Moor Street and Deansgate opened for freight in 1829.\n\nThe first section of track between Derby Street Bolton and William Hulton's collieries at Pendlebury Fold near Chequerbent in Westhoughton was officially opened on 1 August 1828\n\nThe official opening of the completed part of the railway (which the Manchester Guardian Newspaper reported as being from Checkerbent to the town of Bolton) was witnessed by \"an immense concourse of people\". They saw a procession of a \"new locomotive engine made by Messrs. R. Stephenson and Co. of Newcastle ... to which were attached six waggons filled with people, and decorated with numerous flags and streamers; then followed a very elegant and commodious coach, intended at some future period to convey passengers on the railway. This was filled with ladies amongst whom was Mrs. Hulton. Then followed seven other wagons, decorated with flags, and crowded with passengers, including the musicians of the Bolton old band, who occupied the two last waggons, and played a variety of appropriate airs, during the procession\".\n\nThe procession started at 1215 with the locomotive drawing the thirteen waggons and the coach from Pendlebury Fold, near Hulton Park, to Top-o'th'-Pike where the stationary engine was situated. There were about 150 people on the train which travelled at about . On reaching the stationary engine the waggons were detached and \"Mrs. Hulton, after a short address, baptised the engine by the name of the \"Lancashire Witch\"\". She then presented a garland of flowers to the engineer, who treated it, in the newspapers view, rather unceremoniously by placing it on the furnace-pipe (presumably the chimney) where the flowers soon underwent a lamentable change.\n\nThe engine was sent back to one of Mr. Hulton's collieries from whence it returned hauling six waggons containing about 2 tons of coal which it drew with great ease at about . The locomotive was again detached from its train and demonstrated some of its abilities, starting and stopping under control even from speeds estimated up to . After the demonstration the coach and waggons were attached to the rope of the stationary engine and proceeded down the inclined plane towards Bolton. The waggons were \"occasionally moved with great celerity, and occasionally stopped by means of brakes applied to the wheels, in order to shew the command possessed over them by the engineer, in case of any accident or obstruction\". The crowd was so large that several people were thrown onto the railway where they were \"placed in the most imminent peril\" and one man was reported as nearly falling under the wheels of a waggon before it could be stopped, he was reportedly severely hurt.\n\nAt the bottom of the incline it was intended that the waggons should be horse-drawn to the terminus but the crowd man-handled the waggons to their destination. Upon arrival, a considerable number of gentlemen sat down to an excellent dinner at the Commercial Inn, Mr. Hulton in the chair.\n\nThe coach used by the ladies during the opening was loaned by the L&MR and another carriage was borrowed from them in December 1829 for 'an experiment in passenger carrying' but passengers weren't regularly carried until 1831.\n\nThe line was completed through to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Leigh by end of March 1830. By then the construction of the Kenyon and Leigh Junction Railway which provided a connection with the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was already well advanced.\n\nThe line was just under in length, and was originally single track with the exception of about half a mile towards the north end of the line, there were occasional sidings or passing places.\n\nWhishaw (1842) gives a description of the line, starting from Bolton Great Moor Street the train is worked by horse-power to the bottom of the Daubhill incline. Here a stationary steam engine hauled the train up out of Bolton. Trains running down the incline are worked by gravity. The incline rises 118 feet in 1 mile 3 furlongs (about 36 m in 2.2 km).\n\nAt the top of this incline the locomotive is attached and the train works to Leigh. In the other direction a stationary steam engine hauls trains (including their locomotives) up from Bag Lane through Chequerbent towards Bolton. This incline rises 243 feet but over a greater distance so the slope is less severe overall.\n\nThe rope for the Chequerbent incline is made by Webster of Sunderland and is in circumference, it weighs about when new and costs £2 10s per hundredweight. This rope when partially worn is transferred to the Daubhill incline.\n\nThe width occupied by the railway on a level surface is and the track is ballasted with small coal.\n\nThe OS map of 1849 shows the original B&LR line running to the canal as well as the newer K&LJnR line running over the bridge.\n\nDouble track was laid in sections with the section from Pennington to Atherton Junctions opening on 31 May 1880, the section through Bag Lane on 4 July 1880 and the final section through to Bolton on 1 February 1885, south of Pennington on the former K&LJR had been doubled when the Tyldesley Loopline opened in 1864.\n\nThe original passenger stations on the line all opened on 11 June 1831 when the line opened for passenger traffic, although \"station\" meant somewhere people could get on or off the train, the facilities would have been primitive by later standards. At Bolton, for example, the booking office was described as little more than a shed.\n\nThe original stations were:\n\nNew stations opened in 1885 at Daubhill and Chequerbent when the line was realigned to remove the inclines and increase capacity, the track doubling took place during the same period.\n\nThe new Daubhill station opened on opened on 2 February 1885 on the new alignment of the railway, it was renamed Rumworth & Daubhill on 28 April 1885.\n\nThe new Chequerbent railway station, sometimes known as \"Chequerbent for Hulton Park\", opened on opened on 2 February 1885 on the new alignment of the railway.\n\nThe last station to open was Atherleigh which the London, Midland and Scottish Railway opened on 14 October 1935 as there had been new housing development in the area.\n\nThe Bolton and Leigh Railway (B&LR) was the first public railway in Lancashire, being a public railway meant carrying goods either by company wagon or privately owned wagon. The B&LR chose to follow the turnpike and canal tradition where the service was available to anyone who could pay the toll.\n\nShortly after the line had opened its 'utility' was being reported on favourably, coal was reduced in price in the Bolton area by more than 2s per ton. Business on the line improved when the Kenyon and Leigh Junction Railway (K&LJR) was constructed to link the B&LR from its southern terminus with the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR) at Kenyon.\n\nWhen the K&LJR presented its bill to Parliament in 1828, MPs were more amenable towards railway companies and the canal company withdrew its opposition to the railway crossing the canal. In 1829 the K&LJR received its royal assent to build a single-track line from the end of the Bolton and Leigh Railway near Twiss (now Twist) Lane in Westleigh to Kenyon, where a junction would be made with the L&MR which was at an advanced stage of construction.\n\nThe line crossed the Leeds and Liverpool Canal before heading south towards Kenyon. Stations were built at Bradshaw Leach and Kenyon. As soon as it opened on 3 January 1831, goods trains could access of line between Bolton and Liverpool and a few months later a passenger service to Liverpool started.\n\nWalker (1832) reports that from 1 June 1832 passenger service levels for all days except Sunday were:\nOn Sundays there was only one departure at 1730.\n\nJourneys in the opposite direction were not described by Walker but he does report the fare as being \"Inside, 5s; Outside, 3s6d\".\n\nBy 1834 the B&LR had leased the running of the railway to John Hargreaves, an established carrier of Bolton. Hargreaves was granted running rights over the K&LJR and the L&MR so that he ran the services between Bolton and Liverpool. Hargreaves also worked goods services to Manchester. He was required to provide his own locomotive power, carriages, and wagons, except a few for ballasting which belong to the Company. Hargreaves was an established carrier on roads and canals before the railway was built and the main carrier from north west England into Scotland, the equal of Pickfords who controlled the trade to the south of Manchester. Hargreaves became a pioneer of excursions by rail, running Sunday trips from Bolton to Liverpool as early as 1841. In 1843 he ran excursions to London and two years later to Manchester. The Grand Junction Railway (GJR) terminated the Hargreaves leases on 31 December 1845.\n\nThe stationary engines played a prominent role on the line for at least 15 years, an interesting example, amongst the few, of the transitional years embodying both techniques of haulage. It is believed the stationary engines remained in operation until about 1846. Cable haulage was discontinued once locomotive performance had improved sufficiently.\n\nThe railway obtained two subsequent Acts, the third Act in 1831 to amend and enlarge the existing acts and authorising an additional £16,500 of joint stock capital and the powers to raise an additional £25,000 in loans.\n\nThe fourth Act, which received royal assent in 1836 was an Act to amend and enlarge the several Acts already in force and it gave the Company power to borrow an additional £60,000. One of the other purposes was the right to lease the K&LJR for up to 25 years, as well as for the purchase of the line for the sum of £44,750.\n\nIn 1838 there were 86,320 passengers conveyed on the line, an average of 236.5 per day generating an annual income of £6831 6s 4d.\n\nShortly after the passing of the second Act the railway took delivery of their first steam locomotive, which had been ordered from Robert Stephenson and Company by the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in January 1828. The L&MR subsequently decided their order was premature and the locomotive was transferred to the B&LR by mutual agreement. This was the locomotive named \"Lancashire Witch\" at the opening of the line.\n\nThe \"Lancashire Witch\" had some innovative features, it was built with 45° inclined cylinders that allowed the axles to be sprung resulting in improved stability. The locomotive was also equipped an expansion valve that allowed the control of the flow of steam that entered the cylinders, which made it the first locomotive to feature expansive working.\n\nBy 1831, the railway owned at least three other locomotives. \"Union\", which was built in 1830 by Rothwell, Hick and Rothwell, along with \"Salamander\" and \"Veteran\", which were both built by Crook and Dean.\n\nIn 1832 the railway hired Timothy Hackworth's \"Sans Pareil\" at a rate of £15 per month, and then bought it outright for £110.\n\nIn 1842 there were 14 locomotives in operation on the line:\n\n\"Sans Pareil\" was used on the railway until 1844, when it was sold to the Coppull Colliery, Chorley and used as a stationary engine up until 1863, when it was presented to the Patent Office Museum (now the Science Museum).\n\nThe early passenger accommodation on the trains comprised two coaches, named \"Elephant\" and \"Castle\", which provided the inside accommodation whilst the external accommodation was wooden seats in open wagons.\n\nIn 1842 there were five first-class carriages each holding 24 passengers in three compartments, each carriage was 15'3\" long with an inside width of 6'6\". The carriages have spring buffers are painted green with the company arms on the panels, the insides are lined with blue cloth. Each carriage weighs about 3 tons and were built by Mr Cooper of Bradshawgate, Bolton, each costing £400. A sixth carriage was slightly different holding twenty passengers, sixteen in two regular compartments and four in a coupe.\n\nThere were also eight second-class carriages each holding 24 passengers in three compartments, the carriages are enclosed at the ends but open at the sides.\n\nIn 1842 there were about 300 wagons in use on the line, all belonging to John Hargreaves, about 40 of which have iron bottoms.\n\nIn 1844 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway had been negotiating with the Bolton and Leigh Railway and the Kenyon and Leigh Junction Railway with a view to an amalgamation, these negotiations were made more complicated by the initial inclusion of the North Union Railway in the proposed merger and then even more complicated when the Grand Junction Railway became interested, all the lines were connected and provided through running for each other's trains. Negotiations were reaching their conclusions when the NUR shareholders rejected their part in the amalgamation. At this juncture the K&LJR simplified the arrangements by agreeing to be purchased outright by the B&LR (under the provisions of the 1836 Act) so the amalgamation took place on 8 August 1845 without the NUR and the B&LR became part of an enlarged Grand Junction Railway.\n\nThe GJR became part of the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR) on 16 July 1846 when it was formed by the amalgamation of the GJR, the Manchester and Birmingham Railway, the London and Birmingham Railway and the Trent Valley Railway.\n\nTimetables are available for several of the years the line was open:\n\n\nThe stations at Chequerbent and Daubhill closed to passengers on 3 March 1952.\n\nAll other stations and the line closed to passengers on 29 March 1954 but temporarily re-opened in five successive years to cope with Bolton Wakes Week traffic.\n\nThe line closed in sections, Atherton Junction to Pennington South Junction closed to freight on 7 October 1963, and with it Atherton goods station.\n\nChequerbent goods yard closed on 27 February 1965.\n\nWith the demise of goods traffic, Crook Street Yard in Bolton closed in April 1965 and private sidings were closed by October 1967. The only coal traffic using the line in the 1960s was from Jackson's sidings in Tyldesley. Passenger traffic from the Tyldesley Loopline closed following the Beeching cuts on 5 May 1969 when all the stations on that line were closed.\n\n\n\n"}

He is well known for his eye for goal and movement off the ball, especially in the penalty area, as well as his aerial prowess and excellent ability to score headed goals.\n\nA former Italian international, he represented his nation at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nBorn in Pescia, Pazzini started his career at Atalanta, with whom he made his professional debut in 2003, and quickly emerging as a promising youngster. He spent two seasons with Atalanta, playing 51 league games and scoring 12 goals (of which 3 of them at Serie A level). He switched from a left back to a striker.\n\nPazzini joined Fiorentina from Atalanta for around €6 million in January 2005. During his first season, he scored ten goals in four appearances. but did not find space in Cesare Prandelli's plans as the latter preferred Luca Toni as the main striker, with Pazzini and Valeri Bojinov acting as second strikers.\n\nWith the arrival of former Milan striker Alberto Gilardino, Prandelli opted for Adrian Mutu and Gilardino to form a striking partnership, reducing Pazzini to a backup role.\n\nAs a result of limited first team opportunities, Pazzini agreed a move to Sampdoria in January 2008 for a €9 million transfer fee.\n\nAfter his first match, against Palermo, in the next matchday Pazzini found the back of the net for the first time with the \"blucerchiati\" against Udinese in the Coppa Italia. He scored his first goal in Serie A with his new team on 1 February 2009 in the match against Chievo, which finished in a 1–1 draw. His rejuvenated form continued when he hit his first brace with Sampdoria in a 3–0 hammering against Italian champions Internazionale in the Coppa Italia, and his second consecutive brace arrived in the Serie A encounter against Roma (2–2). He combined well with Antonio Cassano up front, forming arguably one of the most effective partnerships of the season in Serie A, and drawing comparisons with Sampdoria's former Gianluca Vialli and Roberto Mancini strike-pairing of the late 1980s and early 1990s. At the time, Pazzini was considered the best Italian striker.\n\nOn 26 September, he scores the winner-goal in a match against Inter. Winning this game, Sampdoria can lead the table for the first time since 1991.\n\nPazzini joined Italian champions Inter Milan on a four-and-a-half-year deal on 28 January 2011, with Jonathan Biabiany heading in the opposite direction as part of the deal; Pazzini was valued €19 million whilst Biabiany was tagged for €7 million. Pazzini scored a brace on his debut, a 3–2 home win over Palermo, and scored another goal in his second game against Bari. He also scored the winner in a 1–2 win against Fiorentina on 16 February 2011. On 30 April 2011, he scored 2 in a 2–1 win over Cesena, both in stoppage time. On 22 May 2011, he scored a further two goals in Inter's 3–1 victory over Catania.\n\nPazzini began the 2011–12 season on a weak note, failing to score until the fifth matchday in a 3–1 victory over Bologna. He then scored in the next match after a dribble from teammate Yuto Nagatomo in a 3–2 away victory against CSKA Moscow. He later suffered a three-month goal drought until he scored Inter's opener in a 2–0 victory against Fiorentina. Pazzini also added another goal later that month against Lecce and scored in Inter's opening match of the 2012 calendar year in a 5–0 victory against Parma. Owing partially to the excellent form of his teammate Diego Milito and partially due to a lack of consistency in managerial preferences and squad selection, Pazzini made a majority of his appearances for Inter during the 2011–12 season as a substitute off the bench. As such, Pazzini was only able to score five goals in Serie A for the season and was often frustrated in front of goal in European competition as well.\n\nAfter being transfer listed by the \"Nerazzurri\", Pazzini joined Milan on 22 August 2012, in exchange for Antonio Cassano and a €7.5 million compensation in favour of the \"Nerazzurri\". (Pazzini tagged for €13 million and Cassano for €5.5 million.)\n\nOn 24 August 2012, Pazzini told \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" of what occurred at Inter: \"I dream about being a deciding factor in a derby and in many other matches. I could say some things but the row would go on for days and I just don't feel like it. The night before the summer training camp I had a phone call telling me I was out of the team,\" he revealed, \"and the following day I was told: 'You won't be playing in any of the friendlies', but it wasn't Stramaccioni. I was getting bad vibes, but now I'm looking to the future.\" I'm really motivated because I'm coming out of a negative year,\" explained Pazzini. \"I really want to get things together and get back to being the player I was five months ago, at international level too. I dream of getting a call from Prandelli.\" Regarding the swap that brought Cassano to Inter, Pazzini stated, \"Antonio and I have been friends since our days at Sampdoria. When I read about this deal on the front page of a paper I called him and joked: 'See, these days you need me to get your name onto the front page...' But during the training camp at Inter, it was Pazzini who announced his imminent departure to the fans. \"It wasn't an outburst of any kind, I was calm and cool.

It opened in 1831.\n\nThe Grand Junction Railway aspired to make its long-distance route from Birmingham to Liverpool and Manchester, and acquire the W&NR so as to use it from Warrington northwards. The permanent way needed to be strengthened for main line use. The GJR opened its line in 1837, connecting at Warrington to the W&NR and gaining access to Liverpool and Manchester over the L&MR. The W&NR was the first part of the present-day West Coast Main Line to be opened. \n\nOn 15 September 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened for business. Although this was a purely west to east line, primarily connecting the manufactories of Manchester with the great docks of Liverpool, there were already thoughts of forming a British railway network.\n\nWhile the L&MR was still being built, a company to make a branch line from it to Warrington was being proposed, and the Warrington and Newton Railway was authorised by Parliament on 14 May 1829. It was to run from a terminal at Dallum Lane in Warrington, to Newton (later Newton-le-Willows) on the L&MR, a distance of a little over 4 miles. There was to be a branch at Warrington to Bank Quay, close to the River Mersey, and a northward extension at Newton to coal pits at Haydock. Authorised share capital was £53,000. The junction at Newton was to face towards Liverpool. Warrington was a manufacturing town with a population of about 19,000. One of the main objects was the quick conveyance of coal from the Haydock pits near Newton to Warrington.\n\nThere was a lack of unity on the board over the construction, which delayed construction, and powerful landowners on the intended route of the line also made difficulties. The type of track adopted had cast iron fishbellied rails and untreated larch sleepers; the failure to apply preservative treatment resulted in early failure of the sleepers.\n\nThe Liverpool-facing connection at Newton was seen to be a limitation, and in 1830, a second Act was secured, authorising a curve at Newton to connect to the L&MR in the Manchester direction, and also to make a direct connection to the Wigan Branch Railway, which ran north from a junction at Parkside, which faced Manchester. In fact both the Warrington and Newton Railway and the Wigan Branch Railway found themselves short of funds and they were unable to build the connecting lines and spur.\n\nThe Warrington and Newton Railway opened between Warrington (Dallam) and a location at Newton, terminating at a point south of the L&MR junction, at the beginning of June 1831. This was for the Haydock Park races, and passenger trains ran regularly after that. The Newton curve and connection to the L&MR was completed on 25 July 1831. There were four trains each way Monday to Saturday only, although Sunday trains were put on by 1833. The trains were worked by three locomotives, named Warrington, Newton and Vulcan.\n\nThe Bank Quay branch was not completed at first, and it was probably opened about 1835, diverging from the Dallam line at Jockey Lane. Until 1837 it was used for goods and mineral traffic only; it was close to the River Mersey where shipping could berth.\n\nIn 1832 and 1833 the promoters of the Grand Junction Railway were considering their options. They wished to build a trunk railway connecting Birmingham with Liverpool and Manchester. If Liverpool was to be connected to the network further south, then the River Mersey would need to be crossed: the Warrington & Newton Railway could serve as the northern extremity if a crossing of the Mersey in Warrington were made. The proposed Grand Junction Railway would link Birmingham with the central point of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway at Newton Junction, and Liverpool and Manchester would thereby be joined with Birmingham. This compromise lengthened the distance by rail between Birmingham and the two Lancashire towns, but the greater convenience and economy was decisive, and the necessary authorising Act was secured on 6 May 1833.\n\nThe directors of the W&NR saw that their railway was important for the Grand Junction Railway and by the end of 1833 they were demanding £125 for each £100 of stock as well as settlement of their debts of about £20,000. Negotiation reduced this to £114 6s a share, but the GJR directors expressed themselves disappointed at this unexpected difficulty. They now considered an alternative route, by-passing the W&NR to the west. Webster says that three inclined planes (on the W&NR) would be avoided by this means. In fact these \"inclined planes\" were not so steep as some: in describing the Grand Junction route, Whishaw says \"In the ascending planes are included only two which have gradients under the first class [steeper gradients]; these are at Burton Wood and Newton Brook, both lying between Warrington and Newton; the former being 21 chains in length, and inclining at the rate of 1 in 209; and the latter having an inclination of 1 in 85, and extending for one mile.\"\n\nIn February 1835 the W&NR agreed to sell their line for shares at par, with the GJR adopting their outstanding debt of about £22,000. The GJR undertook to pay the W&NR shareholders 4 per cent until their main line was open throughout: the purchase price was around £67,000, and the takeover was authorised by Act of 12 June 1835, effective from 1 January 1835. The GJR knew it would have to upgrade the permanent way on the W&NR for stronger materials appropriate fro a main line railway.\n\nThe Grand Junction Railway opened their line from Newton Junction to a temporary Birmingham station at Vauxhall on 4 July 1837. When the Grand Junction Railway line was completed to Warrington on 4 July 1837, the connection was made at Bank Quay and through trains used a station there. Dallam station was relegated to local passenger and goods use at that time.\n\nThe Newton Junction faced Liverpool, and the Parkside Junction of the Wigan Branch Railway faced away, towards Manchester, so that when through running between those lines was started, two reversals were necessary. On 4 July 1837 an east curve at Newton was opened; this was also the date on which the Grand Junction made a connection with the Warrington and Newton; direct running towards Manchester was now possible. Reed says that portion working was adopted, with northbound passenger trains dividing at Newton, and portions continuing to Liverpool and Manchester respectively, but Holt and Biddle say that \"Trains to Liverpool and Manchester did not divide at Newton, but ran independently between Warrington and the L&MR.\" The Newton East Curve was exceptionally sharp, and Reed attributes this to the fact that building it like that obviated the necessity of a further Act of Parliament, by avoiding a land take.\n\nUse of the Newton curves for main-line trains to and from the south continued for Manchester trains until the opening throughout on 10 August 1842, of the Manchester to Crewe line of the Manchester and Birmingham Railway. For Liverpool trains the usage continued until the opening in April 1869 of the Runcorn Railway Bridge and the Runcorn to Weaver Junction line.\n\nThe direct connection between the Warrington and Wigan lines, from what became Winwick junction to Golborne junction was first planned in 1830, but not built then for lack of money. The Grand Junction Railway managed to renew the authorisation, but again was unable to carry out the work. A third authorisation was granted on 11 July 1861 to the London and North Western Railway, and it was opened on 1 August 1864, under powers granted a third time, in 1861. Neele records that its first mention in LNWR passenger timetables was not until February 1872. Night postal trains continued to use the original route as Newton had become an established exchange point for mails.\n\nThe Warrington and Newton Railway was the first \"modern\" railway element of the present-day West Coast Main Line, from London to Glasgow. The other sections were the London and Birmingham Railway, 1837 - 1838, the Trent Valley Railway, 1847, the Grand Junction Railway, 1837, Winwick Jn to Golborne Jn, LNWR 1864, the Wigan branch Railway, 1832, the North Union Railway, 1838, the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway, 1840, the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway, 1846, the Caledonian Railway, 1847 - 1848, the Wishaw and Coltness Railway, 1841, the Caledonian Railway, 1949, the Polloc and Govan Railway, 1840, and the Caledonian Railway, 1879.\n\nThe former W&NR line remains in use at the present day from Bank Quay station to Newton. The West Coast Main Line diverges at Winwick Junction to take the 1867 curve. The original southern section to Dallam has closed. The Three Pigeons public house, (still extant in 2020) is adjacent to the location of the Dallam terminal. Reed says that \"It has been surmised that the Three Pigeons, erected as a public house shortly before the railway, may have served by the good offices of the then landlord, as a booking office for the W. &. N. This seems unlikely; it is at the outer end of the whole station area, and with Warrington as it was in 1831-37 most passengers would come in at the town end from Bewsey Lane and Foundry Lane, and not along Tanner's Lane; and the station building would be of ample size to provide booking accommodation and a waiting room.\"\n"}

In the early 1990s, he was a part of the tag team The Bad Breed with Ian Rotten. He had a short stint with World Championship Wrestling in 1991, but he was best known for his appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) from 1993 to 1999.\n\nBad Breed competed in ECW's tag team division in the early years of the company until the team was forced to disband after losing to The Pitbulls and engaged in a rivalry against each other that \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" named Feud of the Year in 1995. After an unsuccessful singles career, Rotten formed short-lived tag teams with Hack Meyers and D-Von Dudley before forming Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks with Balls Mahoney in 1997. The team lasted until Rotten departed ECW in 1999. Knighton then wrestled on the independent circuit and appeared at World Wrestling Entertainment's ECW One Night Stand pay-per-view in 2005.\n\nKnighton was trained to wrestle by Ricky Lawless at a gym on Baltimore's North Avenue, receiving supplementary training from Joey Maggs. He debuted on the independent circuit at the age of 17, adopting the ring name \"Axl Rotten\", a portmanteau of the rockers Axl Rose and Johnny Rotten. Rotten won his first championship teaming with Lawless to win the tag team titles in Frank Cain's Star Cavalcade Wrestling during the summer of 1988. He also succeeded Lawless as the promotion's heavyweight champion when, shortly after reigning champion Ricky Lawless was murdered, he won the vacant title from The Psycho in Thomasville, Georgia on November 30, 1988.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Rotten trained Ian Rotten, who formed a tag team with Axl, masquerading as his brother and taking his stage name from Cheech Marin's character in \"Get Out of My Room\". The duo, known as The Bad Breed, wrestled primarily in the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation. Axl later opened his own professional wrestling promotion in Maryland called Universal Independent Wrestling. The promotion featured wrestlers such as the Bad Breed, Bam Bam Bigelow and Scotty The Body. It had a television series that aired on Saturday nights on the local ABC channel. The promotion closed in the mid-1990s.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1993, Axl and Ian Rotten had a run with the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF) in Texas, being featured on their daily ESPN show. While in GWF, Axl succeeded in winning both the GWF Commonwealth title and the GWF Tag Team Championship, with Ian Rotten.\n\nIn 1991, Rotten had a short stint with World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he feuded with P.N. News. During his time with WCW, Rotten befriended Paul E. Dangerously, the future owner of Extreme Championship Wrestling.\n\nIn 1993, the Bad Breed were hired by Paul Heyman, the then-booker of the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion as a fan favorite tag team, debuting for the promotion at \"Bloodfest: Day 1\" on October 1 by defeating Chad Austin and Todd Shaw. They made their televised debut on the October 5 episode of \"Hardcore TV\", losing to Badd Company. They competed in ECW's tag team division, where they unsuccessfully challenged Tony Stetson and Johnny Hotbody for the Tag Team Championship at November to Remember. They were initially allied with Terry Funk until the team were sent to United States Wrestling Association (USWA) in 1994. Bad Breed returned to ECW on the June 21 episode of \"Hardcore TV\", where they challenged The Public Enemy for the Tag Team Championship, which Public Enemy retained as the match ended in a no contest. Bad Breed defeated Hack Myers and Rockin' Rebel at Heat Wave, and then unsuccessfully challenged Public Enemy for the World Tag Team Championship in a Baseball Brawl match at Hardcore Heaven.\n\nBad Breed next entered a feud with The Pitbulls, to whom they lost in a match at November to Remember. On the January 17, 1995 episode of \"Hardcore TV\", Bad Breed lost to Pitbulls in a rematch which stipulated that the losing team would be forced to break up. Both Rotten brothers blamed one another for the loss and Ian turned on Axl by hitting him with a chair after the loss, playing off real-life ill feelings, a rivalry developed that \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" named Feud of the Year in 1995. The former partners traded wins at Double Tables and Return of the Funker. They faced one another in a variety of hardcore matches over the next few months, including a hair versus hair match at \"Three Way Dance\", a barbed wire baseball bat match at Hostile City Showdown and a barbed wire baseball bat barbed wire chair match at \"Enter Sandman\", all of which Axl won. A reunion was teased between Bad Breed at \"Barbed Wire, Hoodies and Chokeslams\" on June 17, where they were supposed to take on Public Enemy for the World Tag Team Championship but Bill Alfonso overruled the decision due to Bad Breed being banned from competing as a team. Their feud finally ended at Hardcore Heaven, when Axl defeated Ian in a Taipei Deathmatch.\n\nFollowing his feud with Ian Rotten, it was announced on the July 4 episode of \"Hardcore TV\" that Axl would receive his very first opportunity for the World Heavyweight Championship against The Sandman at Heat Wave, where Rotten failed to win the title. Rotten then floundered in the mid-card, defeating J.T. Smith at November to Remember.\n\nRotten lost to the debuting Rob Van Dam in RVD's first ECW match at House Party on January 5, 1996. Rotten would then team with El Puerto Riqueño in a loss to The Headhunters at \"Big Apple Blizzard Blast\". His failures in singles competition continued as he would lose against the likes of J.T. Smith, The Sandman and Shane Douglas in subsequent matches. Rotten began a rivalry with The Full Blooded Italians, defeating FBI member Little Guido at Hostile City Showdown. At A Matter of Respect, Rotten teamed with Hack Meyers against FBI members J.T. Smith and Little Guido in a losing effort. Rotten then formed a tag team with Meyers as they took on The Samoan Gangsta Party at Hardcore Heaven, which ended in a no contest due to interference by The Gangstas and The Eliminators. At Heat Wave, Rotten competed against Tarzan Goto in a losing effort.\n\nAt \"The Doctor is In\", Rotten competed against D-Von Dudley in a match which ended in a no contest after interference by Dudley Brothers. Rotten left with D-Von after the match and formed a tag team with D-Von, thus turning into a villainous character for the first time in his ECW career. Rotten and Dudley wrestled Dudley Brothers in a series of matches throughout the fall of 1996. Rotten defeated his former tag team partner Hack Meyers at November to Remember. Rotten and D-Von pursued the World Tag Team Championship, receiving title shots against The Gangstas on the December 10 episode of \"Hardcore TV\" and The Eliminators at House Party on January 11, 1997, but failed to win the titles. Rotten followed with a feud against Dudley Brothers member Spike Dudley, whom he defeated in matches at \"Winter Blowout\" and CyberSlam.\n\nD-Von Dudley went on to form a tag team with Buh Buh Ray Dudley called Dudley Boyz at Crossing the Line Again, which broke up Rotten's team with D-Von and Rotten moved on to singles competition. Shortly after, he formed a tag team with newcomer Balls Mahoney called The Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks, thus turning into a fan favorite again. The team began pursuing the World Tag Team Championship and feuded with teams such as Dudley Boyz, The Full Blooded Italians and The Gangstanators for the title. Rotten made his pay-per-view debut at November to Remember, where Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks competed against Gangstanators, FBI and Dudley Boyz in a four-way dance for the tag team titles, where they were the last team eliminated by defending champions Full Blooded Italians. Mahoney and Rotten often teamed with the likes of New Jack and Spike Dudley to feud with Dudley Boyz and The Full Blooded Italians.\n\nMahoney and Rotten were frequent contenders for the World Tag Team Championship but came up short in their bid for the titles. They received several title shots against Chris Candido and Lance Storm for the tag team titles including one at Wrestlepalooza on May 3, 1998, but came up short in their title opportunities. Rotten was out of action due to injury in September and returned to ECW on December 4 by attacking Buh Buh Ray Dudley with a barbed wire baseball bat after a match between Dudley Boyz and The Gangstanators. Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks would then challenge Rob Van Dam and Sabu for the World Tag Team Championship on numerous occasions including the House Party event on January 16, 1999, but failed to win the title. They also entered a feud with Danny Doring and Roadkill after beating Doring and Roadkill and FBI in a three-way dance at Guilty as Charged, resulting in Mahoney and Rotten taking on Doring and Roadkill in a series of matches including one at \"Crossing the Line\", which Mahoney and Rotten won. At CyberSlam, Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks and New Jack lost to Mr. Mustafa and the Dudley Boyz in an Ultimate Jeopardy match.\n\nAt Anarchy Rulz, Rotten issued a challenge to Mike Awesome for the World Heavyweight Championship, right before the World Television Championship main event match but was confronted and attacked by Impact Players and Johnny Smith, who was the scheduled opponent for World Television Champion Rob Van Dam. Balls Mahoney and Spike Dudley made the rescue for Rotten by attacking Impact Players and Smith, resulting in Mahoney substituting for Smith and went on to lose. Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks would feud with the likes of The New Dangerous Alliance and Da Baldies during the fall of 1999. At November to Remember, the Freaks teamed with New Jack to take on Da Baldies (Spanish Angel, Tony DeVito, P.N. News and Vito LoGrasso) in a three-on-four handicap match, which they lost to Baldies. On the December 19 episode of \"ECW on TNN\", Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks defeated Baldies members P.N. News and Vito LoGrasso in a falls count anywhere match, in which the loser of the fall would be forced to leave ECW, thus forcing Vito out of ECW. Rotten wrestled his last ECW match on December 9, in which he and New Jack defeated Tony DeVito and P.N. News.\n\nRotten eventually left ECW in 1999 and appeared with Xtreme Pro Wrestling and the Japanese Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling promotion. Rotten then wrestled on the independent circuit throughout the early 2000s.\n\nRotten performed at the ECW reunion event Hardcore Homecoming on June 10, 2005, reuniting with Ian Rotten in a loss to The Gangstanators. At the follow-up event, November Reign, on November 6, 2005, Rotten defeated Ian Rotten in a Taipei Death match. Rotten also wrestled at the Extreme Reunion event on April 28, 2012, facing Balls Mahoney.\n\nIn June 2005, Rotten was temporarily hired by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) for its ECW tribute pay-per-view, One Night Stand. He debuted in WWE on the June 6, 2005 episode of \"Raw\", storming the ring with several other ECW alumni. At One Night Stand on June 12, 2005, Rotten, Balls Mahoney and Kid Kash brawled with The Blue World Order prior to the main event. Rotten went to wrestle several dark matches for WWE in July 2005.\n\nRotten made a one-night appearance with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on August 8, 2010 at the ECW tribute show Hardcore Justice. Rotten teamed with Kahoneys (Balls Mahoney), losing to Team 3D in a \"South Philadelphia Street Fight\".\n\nRotten appeared in an uncredited, non-speaking role on the first episode of the show \"\", entitled \"Gone for Goode\", seen being questioned in \"The Box\" while Lieutenant Al Giardello gives Det. Tim Bayliss his introductory tour of the Homicide Unit.\n\nKnighton was born in the Fell's Point neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. He attended Southern High School, leaving in eleventh grade to pursue his ambition of becoming a professional wrestler.\n\nKnighton suffered from a spine injury in his final years that forced him out of the ring and required the use of a wheelchair. He was living in Anchorage Rehab Center in Salisbury, Maryland.\n\nKnighton was found dead by police in a McDonald's bathroom in Linthicum, Maryland on February 4, 2016. An autopsy showed that Knighton's cause of death was a heroin overdose.\n\nIn July 2016, his estate was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. On October 21, 2016, it was revealed Knighton suffered from CTE. US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018.\n\n\n\n"}

It was established by a statute 13 Ric. II c.2. This court had jurisdiction to try cases concerning contracts and other matters concerning deeds and acts of war. The court of chivalry also has jurisdiction over disputes regarding heraldry and rights to use coats of arms. The court of chivalry is not a court of record, and as such has no power to enforce its decisions by fine or imprisonment; as such it became relatively disused. It is not obsolete, however, and cases have been brought before the court of chivalry as recently as 1954.\n\nA court of honor can also be a military court to investigate and issue judgments concerning acts or omissions which are considered to be unbecoming to an \"officer and a gentleman\", but which do not rise to the level where they are considered crimes triable under military law. A court of honor is also the name given to a tribunal of noblemen who would decide whether a grievance over a point of honor rose to the level warranting a duel, and if so set rules for its fair conduct.\n\nMany Scouting organizations use the term \"Court of Honor\" to refer to a meeting of Patrol Leaders in the Scout troop to plan activities with their Scout Leaders.\n\nIn the Boy Scouts of America a court of honor is a formal troop ceremony usually held quarterly (and intermittently upon conferment of Eagle Scout rank) where Scouts and their families come together to receive rank advancement, merit badges, and other awards. It is also important for Scouts to participate in a court of honor because it counts towards the Second Class requirement 1a and First Class requirement 1a. It is not a regular troop meeting.\n\nIn the Scout Association of Japan a formal troop advancement ceremony is held once a year where Scouts receive rank advancement, merit badges, and other awards, and Scouts in the same school year receive the same rank advancement. It is uncommon for the Scouts' family members to attend, as it is a regular troop meeting.\n\nIn the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, a Court of Honor is a formal ceremony for conferment of the Eagle Scout rank medal on a Boy Scout. The National Court of Honor is a unit in the organization which determines and decides on various important conferments for Scouts and Scouters.\n\nIn Scouts South Africa, a court of honor is held every 4 weeks, normally at the beginning of a new month. The Patrol Leaders (PLs) and a Scouter are expected to attend, they are responsible for the majority of decisions regarding troop discipline, patrol management, troop programme and such. The Troop Scouter is the only adult leader regularly attending these meetings, and has the right to veto decisions. The Troop Scouter generally only acts in an advisory role, allowing the Scouts themselves to make important decisions. The Court of Honor may invite other Scouters to hear their input.\n"}

{"id": "1870891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870891", "title": "Wasted vote", "text": "Wasted vote\n\nIn electoral systems, a wasted vote is any vote which is not for an elected candidate or, more broadly, a vote that does not help to elect a candidate. The narrower meaning includes only those votes which are for a losing candidate or party. The broader definition of wasted votes includes votes for winning candidates in excess of the minimum needed to win. \n\nWasted votes are the basis of the \"efficiency gap\" measure of gerrymandering, where voters are grouped into electoral districts in such a way as to increase the wasted votes of one political faction and decrease the wasted votes of the other.\n\nIn proportional representation representatives are elected at least in rough proportion to voter preferences, resulting in generally fewer wasted votes than in plurality voting.\n\nEven more broadly, a vote is said to be a qualitatively wasted in the judgment of the voter when their vote has been needlessly added to a candidate who is less valued than a more valued and available candidate.\n\nAn electoral system which reduces the number of wasted votes can be considered desirable on grounds of fairness or on the more pragmatic basis that a voter who feels their vote has made no difference may feel detached from their government or lose confidence in the democratic process. The term \"wasted vote\" is especially used by advocates of systems like Evaluative Proportional Representation (EPR) in Section 5.5.5 in Proportional Representation, approval voting, the single transferable vote, two round systems or instant-runoff voting which purport to reduce the numbers of such votes.\nEvaluative Proportional Representation not only wastes no votes quantitatively, it also claims to remove the needless qualitative wasting of votes. Each EPR voter is invited to grade each of the candidate's suitability for office as either Excellent (ideal), Very Good, Good, Acceptable, Poor, or Reject (entirely unsuitable). Each citizen is assured that their one vote will proportionately increase the voting power of the elected member of the legislature who received either their highest grade, remaining highest grade, or proxy vote.\n\nThe term may be considered pejorative by opponents of such systems. Their arguments may either suggest that in any voting system each vote is wasted (unless the result is decided by a single vote), or that no vote is wasted as each one sends a political signal which will be taken into account in preparation for the subsequent election.\n\nIn election campaigns, a leading candidate may appeal to voters who support a less-popular candidate to vote instead for the leading candidate for tactical reasons, on the basis that a vote for their preferred candidate is likely to be wasted. In some electoral systems, it may be plausible for less-popular candidates to make similar appeals to supporters of more-popular candidates. In a plurality voting system, the term \"wasted vote\" is not usually applied to votes for the second-placed candidate, but rather to votes for candidates finishing third or lower. This is a reflection of Duverger's Law, i.e. the institutionalisation of a two-party system.\n\nConsider an election where candidates A, B and C receive 6000, 3100 and 701 votes respectively.\n\nIf this is a plurality voting election for a single seat, Candidate A has a plurality of votes and is therefore elected. The wasted votes are:\n\nIf the same votes for A, B and C are cast in a d'Hondt method election for 12 seats, then the seats are split 8-4-0 for A-B-C. The wasted votes are:\n\nA majority of votes are always wasted (in the wider sense) in a single-seat election, unless there are exactly two candidates and the margin of victory is exactly one vote. Multi-seat constituencies reduce the number of wasted votes as long as proportional representation is used. (When used with winner-take-all systems, as with the US Electoral College, multi-member constituencies may see the wasted vote reach or exceed 50%).\n\nWasted votes are the basis for computing the \"efficiency gap\", a measure devised by University of Chicago law professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos and political scientist Eric McGhee in 2014. This statistic has been used to quantitatively assess the effect of gerrymandering, the assigning of voters to electoral districts in such a way as to increase the number of districts won by one political party at the expense of another. The heart of the computation is to add up, over all electoral districts, the wasted votes of each party's candidates. The efficiency gap is the difference between the two parties' wasted votes, divided by the total number of votes. Stephanopoulos and McGhee argued that in a non-partisan redistricting with two roughly equally popular parties, the efficiency gap would be zero, with an equal number of wasted votes from either party. If the gap exceeded 7%, then Stephanopoulos and McGhee argued that this could ensure the party with fewer wasted votes would be able to control the state for the duration of the validity of the district map.\n\nCiting in part an efficiency gap of 11.69% to 13% in favor of the Republicans, in 2016 a U.S. District Court ruled in \"Gill v. Whitford\" against the 2011 drawing of Wisconsin legislative districts. It was the first U.S. Federal court ruling to strike down a redistricting on the grounds of favoring a political party. In the 2012 election for the state legislature, Republican candidates had 48.6% of the two-party votes but won 61% of the 99 districts. The court found that the disparate treatment of Democratic and Republican voters violated the 1st and 14th amendments to the US Constitution. The State appealed the district court's \"Gill v. Whitford\" ruling to the Supreme Court, which said that the plaintiffs did not have standing and sent the case back to the district court. Consequently, existing gerrymandered district maps were used in the 2018 elections. For the State Assembly, 54% of the popular vote supported Democratic candidates, but the Republicans retained their 63-seat majority. The efficiency gap, estimated to be 10% in 2014, increased to 15% based on election results.\n\nThe following example illustrates the efficiency gap calculation. There are two parties, A and B. According to the original paper, wasted votes for the winner (say A) are those \"beyond the 50 per-cent threshold needed\" i.e., beyond 50% plus one or A-((A+B)/2+1) or more simply (A-B)/2-1, if A-B is even, like here, otherwise use int((A-B)/2). There are 500 voters divided into 5 districts with 100 voters each. In the recent election, Party A had about 45% of the votes but won 4 of the 5 districts, as follows: \n\nThe efficiency gap is the difference in the two party's wasted votes, divided by the total number of votes.\nEfficiency gap = formula_1 in favor of Party A.\n\nParty A has less than half the votes, but far more of Party B's votes are wasted.\n\nThe Efficiency Gap (EG) measure has been shown to have a number of shortcomings.\nMost notably, it largely reduces to a simple measure of the relationship between the statewide vote lean minus half the seat lean. A state with 60% of its residents belonging to a single party and an election that awarded 60% of the seats to that party—in other words, a perfectly proportional outcome—would therefore be labeled as problematic vote, because its Efficiency Gap would be formula_2, higher than the 8% often cited as a threshold for evidence of gerrymandering.(see Note) This shows EG, powerful as it can be, is insufficient, by itself, for guaranteeing lack of gerrymandering, which guarantee, if it exists, requires additional measures, like compactness measure of a shape as evinced in examples from the paper, which concludes\n\nNote, normalizing EG to a particular proportional split in the population may correct this. One possible Corrected EG (CEG) is (1±EG)/(1+IEG) - 1, where IEG is EG for the ideally proportioned case, as above. The sign used with EG depends on whether the wasted votes favor the majority party(+) or not(-). CEG = 0% for the ideally proportioned case, and CEG = 0.9/1.1 - 1 = -18.18% for the reverse case of the above, 10% EG against the majority party. North Carolina is a gerrymandered state with previously 3 Democrats registered for every 2 Republicans (~60/40 as above) but elects only 3 Democrat vs 10 Republican Congressmen. The NC CEG for 2016 is (1-0.1928)/1.1 - 1 = -26.62%, and for 2018 is (1-0.2746)/1.1 - 1 = -34.05%. EGs here are negative for the majority party wasted vote disadvantage. Reject a hypothesis of no gerrymander if |CEG| > something like 10%.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1870896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870896", "title": "Messinian salinity crisis", "text": "Messinian salinity crisis\n\nThe Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC), also referred to as the Messinian Event, and in its latest stage as the Lago Mare event, was a geological event during which the Mediterranean Sea went into a cycle of partly or nearly complete desiccation throughout the latter part of the Messinian age of the Miocene epoch, from 5.96 to 5.33 Ma (million years ago). It ended with the Zanclean flood, when the Atlantic reclaimed the basin.\n\nSediment samples from below the deep seafloor of the Mediterranean Sea, which include evaporite minerals, soils, and fossil plants, show that the precursor of the Strait of Gibraltar closed tight about 5.96 million years ago, sealing the Mediterranean off from the Atlantic. This resulted in a period of partial desiccation of the Mediterranean Sea, the first of several such periods during the late Miocene. After the strait closed for the last time around 5.6 Ma, the region's generally dry climate at the time dried the Mediterranean basin out nearly completely within a thousand years. This massive desiccation left a deep dry basin, reaching deep below normal sea level, with a few hypersaline pockets similar to today's Dead Sea. Then, around 5.5 Ma, less dry climatic conditions resulted in the basin receiving more freshwater from rivers, progressively filling and diluting the hypersaline lakes into larger pockets of brackish water (much like today's Caspian Sea). The Messinian Salinity Crisis ended with the Strait of Gibraltar finally reopening 5.33 Ma, when the Atlantic rapidly filled up the Mediterranean basin in what is known as the Zanclean flood.\n\nEven today, the Mediterranean is considerably saltier than the North Atlantic, owing to its near isolation by the Strait of Gibraltar and its high rate of evaporation. If the Strait of Gibraltar closes again (which is likely to happen in the near future on a geological time scale), the Mediterranean would mostly evaporate in about a thousand years, after which continued northward movement of Africa may obliterate the Mediterranean altogether.\nIn the 19th century, the Swiss geologist and paleontologist Karl Mayer-Eymar (1826–1907) studied fossils embedded between gypsum-bearing, brackish, and freshwater sediment layers, and identified them as having been deposited just before the end of the Miocene Epoch. In 1867, he named the period the Messinian after the city of Messina in Sicily, Italy. Since then, several other salt-rich and gypsum-rich evaporite layers throughout the Mediterranean region have been dated to the same period.\n\nSeismic surveying of the Mediterranean basin in 1961 revealed a geological feature some below the seafloor. This feature, dubbed the \"M reflector\", closely followed the contours of the present seafloor, suggesting that it was laid down evenly and consistently at some point in the past. The origin of this layer was largely interpreted as related to salt deposition. However, different interpretations were proposed for the age of salt and its deposition.\n\nEarlier suggestions from Denizot in 1957 and Ruggieri in 1967 proposed that this layer was of Late Miocene age, and the same Ruggieri coined the term \"Messinian Salinity Crisis\".\n\nNew and high-quality seismic data on the M-reflector were acquired in the Mediterranean Basin in 1970, published by e.g. Auzende et al. (1971). At the same time, the salt was cored during Leg 13 of the Deep Sea Drilling Program conducted from the \"Glomar Challenger\" under the supervision of co-chief scientists William B.F. Ryan and Kenneth J. Hsu. These deposits were dated and interpreted for the first time as deep-basin products of the Messinian Salinity Crisis.\n\nThe first drilling of the Messinian salt at the deeper parts of the Mediterranean Sea came in the summer of 1970, when geologists aboard the \"Glomar Challenger\" brought up drill cores containing arroyo gravels and red and green floodplain silts; and gypsum, anhydrite, rock salt, and various other evaporite minerals that often form from drying of brine or seawater, including in a few places potash, left where the last bitter, mineral-rich waters dried up. One drill core contained a wind-blown cross-bedded deposit of deep-sea foraminiferal ooze that had dried into dust and been blown about on the hot dry abyssal plain by sandstorms, mixed with quartz sand blown in from nearby continents, and ended up in a brine lake interbedded between two layers of halite. These layers alternated with layers containing marine fossils, indicating a succession of drying and flooding periods.\n\nThe massive presence of salt does not require a desiccation of the sea. The main evidence for the evaporative drawdown of the Mediterranean comes from the remains of many (now submerged) canyons that were cut into the sides of the dry Mediterranean basin by rivers flowing down to the abyssal plain. For example, the Nile cut its bed down to several hundred feet below sea level at Aswan (where Ivan S. Chumakov found marine Pliocene foraminifers in 1967), and below sea level just north of Cairo.\n\nIn many places in the Mediterranean, fossilized cracks have been found where muddy sediment had dried and cracked in the sunlight and drought. In the Western Mediterranean series, the presence of pelagic oozes interbedded within the evaporites suggests that the area was repeatedly flooded and desiccated over 700,000 years.\n\nBased on palaeomagnetic datings of Messinian deposits that have since been brought above sea level by tectonic activity, the salinity crisis started at the same time over all the Mediterranean basin, at 5.96 ± 0.02 million years ago. This episode comprises the second part of what is called the \"Messinian\" age of the Miocene epoch. This age was characterised by several stages of tectonic activity and sea level fluctuations, as well as erosional and depositional events, all more or less interrelated (van Dijk et al., 1998).\n\nThe Mediterranean-Atlantic strait closed tight time and time again, and the Mediterranean Sea, for the first time and then repeatedly, partially desiccated. The basin was finally isolated from the Atlantic Ocean for a longer period, between 5.59 and 5.33 million years ago, resulting in a large or smaller (depending on the scientific model applied) lowering of the Mediterranean sea level. During the initial, very dry stages (5.6–5.5 Ma), there was extensive erosion, creating several huge canyon systems (some similar in scale to the Grand Canyon) around the Mediterranean. Later stages (5.50–5.33 Ma) are marked by cyclic evaporite deposition into a large \"lake-sea\" basin (\"Lago Mare\" event).\n\nAbout 5.33 million years ago, at the start of the Zanclean age (at the start of the Pliocene epoch), the barrier at the Strait of Gibraltar broke one last time, re-flooding the Mediterranean basin in the Zanclean flood (Blanc, 2002; Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2009), favouring slope destabilization (Gargani et al., 2014). The basin has not desiccated since.\n\nThe amount of Messinian salts has been estimated as around (but this estimate may be reduced by 50 to 75% when more information becomes available) and more than 1 million cubic kilometres, 50 times the amount of salt normally in the Mediterranean waters. This suggests either a succession of desiccations or a long period of hypersalinity during which incoming water from the Atlantic Ocean was evaporated with the level of the Mediterranean brine being similar to that of the Atlantic. The nature of the strata points strongly to several cycles of the Mediterranean Sea completely drying and being refilled (Gargani and Rigollet, 2007), with drying periods correlating to periods of cooler global temperatures; which were therefore drier in the Mediterranean region. Each refilling was presumably caused by a seawater inlet opening, either tectonically, or by a river flowing eastwards below sea level into the \"Mediterranean Sink\" cutting its valley head back west until it let the sea in, similarly to a river capture. The last refilling was at the Miocene/Pliocene boundary, when the Strait of Gibraltar broke wide open permanently. Upon closely examining the Hole 124 core, Kenneth J. Hsu found that:\n\nResearch since then has suggested that the desiccation-flooding cycle may have repeated several times during the last 630,000 years of the Miocene epoch. This could explain the large amount of salt deposited. Recent studies, however, show that the repeated desiccation and flooding is unlikely from a geodynamic point of view.\n\nSome major questions remain concerning the beginning of the crisis in the central Mediterranean Basin. The geometric physical link between the evaporitic series identified in marginal basins accessible for field studies, such as the Tabernas basin and Sorbas basin, and the evaporitic series of the central basins has never been made.\n\nUsing the concept of deposition in both shallow and deep basins during the Messinian (i.e. assuming that both Basin types existed during this period), two major groupings are evident: one that favours a synchronous deposition (image c) of the first evaporites in all the basins before the major phase of erosion (Krijgsman et al., 1999); and the other that favours a diachronous deposition (image a) of the evaporites through more than one phases of desiccation which would first have affected the marginal basins and later the central basins.\n\nAnother school suggests that desiccation was synchronous, but occurred mainly in shallower basins. This model would suggest that the sea level of the whole Mediterranean basin fell at once, but only shallower basins dried out enough to deposit salt beds. See image b.\n\nAs highlighted in the work of van Dijk (1992) \nand van Dijk et al. (1998) the history of desiccation and erosion was complexly interacting with tectonic uplift and subsidence events, and erosional episodes. They also questioned again like some previous authors had done, whether the basins now observed as \"deep\" were actually also deep during the Messinian Episode and gave different names to the end-member scenarios described above.\n\nDistinguishing between these hypotheses requires the calibration of gypsum deposits. Gypsum is the first salt (calcium sulphate) to be deposited from a desiccating basin. Magnetostratigraphy offers a broad constraint on timing, but no fine detail. Therefore, cyclostratigraphy is relied upon to compare the dates of sediments.\nThe typical case study compares the gypsum evaporites in the main Mediterranean basin with those of the Sorbas basin, a smaller basin on the flanks of the Mediterranean Sea that is now exposed in southern Spain. The relationship between these two basins is assumed to represent the relationships of the wider region.\n\nRecent work has relied on cyclostratigraphy to correlate the underlying marl beds, which appear to have given way to gypsum at exactly the same time in both basins (Krijgsman, 2001).\n\nThe proponents of this hypothesis claim that cyclic variations in bed compositions are astronomically tuned, and the beds' magnitude can be calibrated to show they were contemporaneous—a strong argument. In order to refute it, it is necessary to propose an alternative mechanism for generating these cyclic bands, or for erosion to have coincidentally removed just the right amount of sediment everywhere before the gypsum was deposited. The proponents claim that the gypsum was deposited directly above the correlated marl layers, and slumped into them, giving the appearance of an unconformable contact. However, their opponents seize upon this apparent inconformity, and claim that the Sorbas Basin was exposed—therefore eroding—while the Mediterranean sea was depositing evaporites. This would result in the Sorbas Basin being filled with evaporites at 5.5 million years ago (Ma), compared to the main basin at 5.96 Ma.).\n\nRecent works have highlighted a pre-evaporite phase corresponding to a prominent erosional crisis (also named \"Messinian erosional crisis\"; the termination of the \"Mes-1\" unconformity bound depositional sequence of van Dijk, 1992) responding to a major drawdown of the Mediterranean seawater.\n\nAssuming that this major drawdown corresponds to the major Messinian drawdown, they concluded that the Mediterranean bathymetry significantly decreased before the precipitation of central basins evaporites. Regarding these works, a deep water formation seems unlikely. The assumption that central basin evaporites partly deposited under a high bathymetry and before the major phase of erosion should imply the observation of a major detritic event above evaporites in the basin. Such a depositional geometry has not been observed on data. This theory corresponds to one of the end-member scenarios discussed by van Dijk et al.\n\nSeveral possible causes of the series of Messinian crises have been considered. While there is disagreement on all fronts, the most general consensus seems to agree that climate had a role in forcing the periodic filling and emptying of the basins, and that tectonic factors must have played a part in controlling the height of the sills restricting flow between the Atlantic and Mediterranean (Gargani and Rigollet, 2007). The magnitude and extent of these effects, however, is widely open to interpretation (see, e.g., van Dijk et al. (1998).\n\nIn any case, the causes of the closing and isolation of the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean must be found in the area where the Strait of Gibraltar is now. One of the tectonic boundaries between the African Plate and the European Plate and its southern fragments such as the Iberian Plate, is there. This boundary Zone is characterised by an arc-shaped tectonic feature, the Gibraltar Arc, which includes southern Spain and northern Africa. In the present day area of the Mediterranean Sea, are three of these arc-shaped belts: the Gibraltar Arc, the Calabrian Arc, and the Aegean Arc. The kinematics and dynamics of this plate boundary and of the Gibraltar Arc during the late Miocene are strictly related to the causes of the Messinian Salinity Crisis: Tectonic reconfiguration may have closed and re-opened passages; the region where the connection with the Atlantic Ocean was situated is permeated by strike-slip faults and rotating blocks of continental crust. As faulting accommodated the regional compression caused by Africa's convergence with Eurasia, the geography of the region may have altered enough to open and close seaways. However, the precise tectonic activity behind the motion can be interpreted in a number of ways. An extensive discussion can be found in Weijermars (1988).\n\nAny model must explain a variety of features of the area:\n\nThere are three contending geodynamic models that may fit the data, models which have been discussed in an equal way for the other arc shaped features in the Mediterranean (for a systematic review see van Dijk & Okkes, 1990):\n\n\nOf these, only the first model, invoking rollback, seems to explain the rotations observed. However, it is difficult to fit it with the pressure and temperature histories of some metamorphic rocks \n(Platt et al., 1998).\n\nThis has led to some interesting combinations of the models which at first hand looked bizarre, in attempts to approach the true state of affairs.\n\nChanges in climate must almost certainly be invoked to explain the periodic nature of the events. They occur during cool periods of Milankovic cycles, when less solar energy reached the northern hemisphere. This led to less evaporation of the North Atlantic, hence less rainfall over the Mediterranean. This would have starved the basin of water supply from rivers and allowed its desiccation.\n\nContrary to many people's instincts, there is now a scientific consensus that global sea level fluctuations cannot have been the major cause, although it may have played a role. The lack of ice caps at the time means there was no realistic mechanism to cause significant changes in sea level—there was nowhere for the water to go, and the morphology of ocean basins cannot change on such a short timescale.\n\nThe climate of the abyssal plain during the drought is unknown. There is no situation on Earth directly comparable to the dry Mediterranean, and thus it is not possible to know its climate. There is not even a consensus as to whether the Mediterranean Sea even dried out completely; it seems likeliest that at least three or four large brine lakes on the abyssal plains remained at all times. The extent of desiccation is very hard to judge, owing to the reflective seismic nature of the salt beds, and the difficulty in drilling cores, making it difficult to map their thickness.\n\nNonetheless, one can study the forces at play in the atmosphere to arrive at a good speculation of the climate. As winds blew across the \"Mediterranean Sink\", they would heat or cool adiabatically with altitude. In the empty Mediterranean Basin, the summertime temperatures would probably have been extremely high even during ice age maxima. Using the dry adiabatic lapse rate of around per kilometer, the maximum possible temperature of an area below sea level would be about warmer than it would be at sea level. Under this extreme assumption, maxima would be near at the lowest points of the dry abyssal plain, permitting no permanent life but extremophiles. Further, the altitude below sea level would result in 1.45 to 1.71 atm (1102 to 1300 mmHg) air pressure, further increasing heat stress. Although it was probably quite dry in the Basin, there is no direct way to measure how much drier it would have been. One can imagine that areas not covered by the remaining brine would have been very dry.\n\nToday the evaporation from the Mediterranean Sea supplies moisture that falls in frontal storms, but without such moisture, the Mediterranean climate that we associate with Italy, Greece, and the Levant would be limited to the Iberian Peninsula and the western Maghreb. Climates throughout the central and eastern basin of the Mediterranean and surrounding regions to the north and east would have been drier even above modern sea level. The eastern Alps, the Balkans, and the Hungarian plain would also be much drier than they are today, even if the westerlies prevailed as they do now. However, the Paratethys ocean provided water to the area north of the Mediterranean basin. The Wallachian-Pontic and Hungarian basins were underwater during the Miocene, modifying the climate of what is now the Balkans and other areas north of the Mediterranean basin. The Pannonian Sea was a source of water north of the Mediterranean basin until the middle Pleistocene before becoming the Hungarian plain. Debate exists whether the waters of the Wallachian-Pontic basin (and the possibly connected Pannonian Sea) would have had access (thus bringing water) to at least the eastern Mediterranean basin at times during the Miocene.\n\nThe Messinian event also provided an opportunity for many African species, including antelopes, elephants and hippopotamuses, to migrate into the empty basin, close to the descending great rivers, to reach interior wetter cooler highlands such as Malta as the sea level was dropping, as such species would not have been able to cross the wide hot empty sink at maximum dryness. After the return of the sea water, they remained on the islands, where they underwent insular dwarfing during the Pleistocene, giving rise to species known from Crete (\"Hippopotamus creutzburgi\"), Cyprus (\"H. minor\"), Malta (\"H. melitensis\") and Sicily (\"H. pentlandi\"). Of these, the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus survived until the end of the Pleistocene or early Holocene. But some of these species may have crossed the sea when it was flooded, washed out to sea on rafts of floating vegetation, or with some species (e.g. elephants) by swimming.\n\nThe water from the Mediterranean would have been redistributed in the world ocean, raising global sea level by as much as . The Mediterranean basin also sequestered below its seabed a significant percentage of the salt from Earth's oceans; this decreased the average salinity of the world ocean and raised its freezing point.\n\nThe notion of a completely waterless Mediterranean Sea has some corollaries.\n\nThere is an opinion that during the Messinian, the Red Sea was connected at Suez to the Mediterranean, but was not connected with the Indian Ocean, and dried out along with the Mediterranean.\n\nWhen the Strait of Gibraltar was ultimately breached, the Atlantic Ocean would have poured a vast volume of water through what would have presumably been a relatively narrow channel. This refill has been envisaged as resulting in a large waterfall higher than today's Angel Falls at , and far more powerful than either the Iguazu Falls or the Niagara Falls, but recent studies of the underground structures at the Gibraltar Strait show that the flooding channel descended in a rather gradual way to the dry Mediterranean.\n\nAn enormous deposit of unsorted debris washed in by a massive catastrophic flood-wash has been found in the seabed southeast of the south corner of Sicily. This is suspected to have been deposited by the Zanclean flood.\n\nThere had been speculations about a possible dehydration of the Mediterranean Sea in the distant past, even before geology developed.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was named for James and Ryan Thornton, naval officers during the American Civil War, and was the second ship to bear this name.\n\n\"Thornton\" was laid down on 3 June 1918 and launched on 2 March 1919 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation; sponsored by Miss Marcia Thornton Davis; and placed in commission at Boston, Massachusetts on 15 July 1919, Commander A. G. Stirling in command.\n\nOn 26 August, \"Thornton\" sailed for Europe. Following a port call in the Azores, the destroyer reached the Strait of Gibraltar on 15 September. For the remainder of 1919, she visited a number of ports, both in the Mediterranean and along the Atlantic coast of Europe.\n\nThe ship returned to Boston on 12 February 1920 and remained there until 27 March, when she weighed anchor for the Pacific. After calls at several ports on the Gulf of Mexico, the destroyer transited the Panama Canal on 30 April. She then steamed slowly up the western coast of Mexico, stopping along the way at Salina Cruz, Manzanillo and Guaymas to show the flag. On 27 May \"Thornton\" reached San Diego, California and, for the next two years, conducted operations along the California coast. On 24 May 1922, \"Thornton\" was placed out of commission and laid up at the Destroyer Base, San Diego.\n\n\"Thornton\" remained in reserve throughout the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nOn 25 May 1940, she was ordered recommissioned for conversion to a seaplane tender. Accordingly, she was recommissioned, in ordinary, on 24 June 1940 and moved to the San Francisco yard of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation for conversion. On 2 August 1940, \"Thornton\" was officially redesignated a seaplane tender (destroyer), AVD-11. Her alterations were completed early in 1941, and she was placed in full commission on 5 March 1941, Lieutenant Commander Wendell F. Kline in command.\n\nOn 8 April, she reported for duty to Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, at San Pedro. Ten days later, the seaplane tender arrived in Pearl Harbor, and she operated in the Hawaiian Islands until August 1942. During her 16 months in the islands, she made frequent voyages to Midway, Wake Island, Palmyra and other outlying islands of the 14th Naval District.\n\nOn the morning of 7 December 1941, she was moored at the Submarine Base at Pearl Harbor. Her action report for that day states that the Japanese opened their attack on Pearl Harbor at 0756 and that \"Thornton's\" crew, led by four reserve ensigns, was at action stations two minutes later. They fought back with every available weapon: four .50-cal. machine guns, three Lewis guns, three Browning automatic rifles, and twelve .30-cal., bolt-action Springfields. The combined fire of \"Thornton\" and accounted for at least one Japanese torpedo bomber and probably discouraged two more from making a run on as the oiler changed berths during the second dive-bombing attack between 0910 and 0917. \"Thornton\" suffered no casualties during the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nFollowing the Pearl Harbor attack, she was stationed at French Frigate Shoals with as aircraft rescue ships for the planes engaged in the expanded air searches. Coincidentally, the Japanese had planned to use the French Frigate Shoals as a rendezvous point for the second half of Operation K, the reconnaissance of Pearl Harbor. The Japanese subsequently cancelled the remainder of Operation K after the Japanese submarine I-123, sent to scout the area, was forced to depart. After the victory at Midway, she resumed her runs between the outlying islands of the 14th Naval District, though the Japanese occupation had removed Wake Island from her itinerary, until August 1942. On the 25th, \"Thornton\" steamed out of Pearl Harbor, headed north, and arrived at Kodiak, Alaska, on the 30th. For the next two months, the seaplane tender cruised the icy Alaskan seas as a part of Task Force 8. She visited Kodiak, Attu, and Chernofski before departing Kodiak for Pearl Harbor on 21 October.\n\n\"Thornton\" stopped at Pearl Harbor from 30 October to 10 November, then headed for duty in the South Pacific. After short periods of duty at Suva in the Fiji Islands, Funafuti in the Ellice Islands, and at Vanikoro in the Santa Cruz Islands, she moved to Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides, arriving on 18 July 1943. The seaplane tender remained at Espiritu Santo until 11 November, when she put to sea for Guadalcanal in the Solomons. Between 13 November and 15 November, she made a round-trip run between Guadalcanal and Espiritu Santo to escort from the latter to the former.\n\nFollowing duty in the Solomons and a stop at Pearl Harbor from 5 February to 8 February, \"Thornton\" returned to the west coast at Mare Island on 17 February 1944. She remained on the west coast for the next 10 months conducting normal operations and undergoing extensive repairs. On 3 December 1944, the warship departed San Pedro to return to the western Pacific.\n\nFrom mid-December 1944 until late February 1945, \"Thornton\" was at Pearl Harbor. On the 22d, she got underway for operations to prepare for the assault on Okinawa. She stopped at Eniwetok early in March, and then moved on to Ulithi, the staging area for Okinawa. On 5 April 1945, while operating in the Ryūkyūs as part of the Search and Reconnaissance Group of the Southern Attack Force, \"Thornton\" collided with and . Her starboard side was severely damaged and open to the sea. On 14 April, she was towed into Kerama Retto. On the 29th, a board of inspection and survey recommended that \"Thornton\" be decommissioned, beached, stripped of all useful materiel as needed, and then abandoned. She was beached and decommissioned on 2 May 1945. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 13 August 1945. In July 1957, \"Thornton's\" hull was abandoned and donated to the government of the Ryukyu Islands.\n\n"}

It is a U.S. National Historic Landmark, designated in 1978 for its architecture.\n\nThe house's floor plan in the shape of a Greek cross, with four equal wings extending from an octagonal core, is based on a published design by William H. Ranlett, \"The Architect\" (New York) 1847, Vol. I, Plate 32, published again in \"Godey's Lady's Book\", January 1850; the \"Godey's Lady's Book\" engravings were framed and kept in the house. The house is an \"Anglo-Grecian Villa\", built in the shape of a Greek cross between 1853-1855 by Peter and Columbia Stuart Hairston. The builder Peter Wilson Hairston a white Superior Court judge in North Carolina, who had inherited Cooleemee from his grandfather, was a central figure in Henry Wiencek's telling of the family's story.\n\nThe house is built from approximately 300,000 bricks made on site. Cooleemee Plantation was founded by Colonel Jesse A. Pearson who took part in the capture of approximately 600 tribal Creek Indians during the War of 1812. The Indians known as \"Kulimi\", a tribe of the Creek nation, were from the village of \"Cooleeme\" near the junction of the Coosa and Tallapoosa Rivers. The Creek word means \"the place where the white oaks grow\". Upon his return in 1814, he named his existing plantation \"Cooleemee Hill\". In 1817, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War and four-time state legislator, Peter Hairston, purchased the Cooleemee Hill Plantation for $8 per acre – $20,000 total. In addition to the plantation house, in 1860 there were twenty-three slave dwellings at Cooleemee. The principal crop at Cooleemee was tobacco.\n\nIn 1997, the Hairston family, who still owned the house, donated a conservation easement to The LandTrust for Central North Carolina, which helped preserve the house and property against development. At that time, the plantation included of farmland (down from at its peak), surrounded by a two-mile (3 km) stretch of the Yadkin River supporting more than 200 species of bird.\n\nCooleemee Plantation was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1978.\n\nIn 1999, Henry Wiencek published \"The Hairstons: An American Family In Black And White\", which told the story of the Hairston family, which continues to own Cooleemee, and of the plantation and its history over the past 150 years. This family, with black and white branches due to slavery, have continued to hold reunions at Cooleemee that honor their family's history and roots in the region. Wiencek, in the course of his preparation for this book, witnessed what he considered to be extraordinary interactions between members of the Hairston Family. In the course of his research, Wiencek learned that the Hairstons were not only the largest slaveholding family in the South, but also slave traders.\n\nPeter Wilson Hairston, the latest Hairston to own the property at the end of the 20th century, published a book in 1986 accounting the history of the family's enslaved people, which helped other research into the family and the property. Hairston died in February 2007 in the same bed in which he was born.\n\nAbout 175 arrowheads that were found on the western side of the Yadkin River at Cooleemee Plantation were classified by Dr. Joffre L. Coe of the University of North Carolina, and Dr. James Bingham, former President of the North Carolina Archaeological Society. The arrowheads which were from different peoples and of different times were dated from approximately 7000 BCE to the 18th century. Several specimens exist which date from 8000 to 8500 years old with the eldest, a Hardaway Point, being dated at 9000 years old.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1870970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870970", "title": "Root-knot nematode", "text": "Root-knot nematode\n\nRoot-knot nematodes are plant-parasitic nematodes from the genus Meloidogyne. They exist in soil in areas with hot climates or short winters. About 2000 plants worldwide are susceptible to infection by root-knot nematodes and they cause approximately 5% of global crop loss. Root-knot nematode larvae infect plant roots, causing the development of root-knot galls that drain the plant's photosynthate and nutrients. Infection of young plants may be lethal, while infection of mature plants causes decreased yield.\n\nRoot-knot nematodes (\"Meloidogyne\" spp.) are one of the three most economically damaging genera of plant-parasitic nematodes on horticultural and field crops. Root-knot nematodes are distributed worldwide, and are obligate parasites of the roots of thousands of plant species, including monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous, herbaceous and woody plants. The genus includes more than 90 species, with some species having several races. Four \"Meloidogyne\" species (\"M. javanica, M. arenaria, M. incognita, and M. hapla\") are major pests worldwide, with another seven being important on a local basis. \"Meloidogyne\" occurs in 23 of 43 crops listed as having plant-parasitic nematodes of major importance, ranging from field crops, through pasture and grasses, to horticultural, ornamental and vegetable crops. If root-knot nematodes become established in deep-rooted, perennial crops, control is difficult and options are limited.\n\n\"Meloidogyne\" spp. were first reported in cassava by Neal in 1889. Damage on cassava is variable depending on cultivar planted, and can range from negligible to serious. Early-season infection leads to worse damage. In most crops, nematode damage reduces plant health and growth; in cassava, though, nematode damage sometimes leads to increased aerial growth as the plants try to compensate. This possibly enables the plant to maintain a reasonable level of production. Therefore, aerial correlations to nematode density can be positive, negative or not at all. Vegetable crops grown in warm climates can experience severe losses from root-knot nematodes, and are often routinely treated with a chemical nematicide. Root-knot nematode damage results in poor growth, a decline in quality and yield of the crop and reduced resistance to other stresses (e.g. drought, other diseases). A high level of damage can lead to total crop loss. Nematode-damaged roots do not use water and fertilisers as effectively, leading to additional losses for the grower. In cassava, it has been suggested that levels of \"Meloidogyne\" spp. that are sufficient to cause injury rarely occur naturally. However, with changing farming systems, in a disease complex or weakened by other factors, nematode damage is likely to be associated with other problems.\nRoot-knot nematodes can be controlled with biocontrol agents \"Paecilomyces lilacinus\", \"Pasteuria penetrans\" and Juglone.\n\nAll nematodes pass through an embryonic stage, four juvenile stages (J1–J4) and an adult stage. Juvenile \"Meloidogynes\" parasites hatch from eggs as vermiform, second-stage juveniles (J2), the first moult having occurred within the egg. Newly hatched juveniles have a short free-living stage in the soil, in the rhizosphere of the host plants. They may reinvade the host plants of their parent or migrate through the soil to find a new host root. J2 larvae do not feed during the free-living stage, but use lipids stored in the gut.\n\nAn excellent model system for the study of the parasitic behaviour of plant-parasitic nematodes has been developed using \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" as a model host. The \"Arabidopsis\" roots are initially small and transparent, enabling every detail to be seen. Invasion and migration in the root was studied using \"M. incognita\". Briefly, second stage juveniles invade in the root elongation region and migrate in the root until they became sedentary. Signals from the J2 promote parenchyma cells near the head of the J2 to become multinucleate to form feeding cells, generally known as giant cells, from which the J2 and later the adults feed. Concomitant with giant cell formation, the surrounding root tissue gives rise to a gall in which the developing juvenile is embedded. Juveniles first feed from the giant cells about 24 hours after becoming sedentary.\n\nAfter further feeding, the J2s undergo morphological changes and become saccate. Without further feeding, they moult three times and eventually become adults. In females, which are close to spherical, feeding resumes and the reproductive system develops. The life span of an adult female may extend to three months, and many hundreds of eggs can be produced. Females can continue egg laying after harvest of aerial parts of the plant and the survival stage between crops is generally within the egg.\n\nThe length of the life cycle is temperature-dependent. The relationship between rate of development and temperature is linear over much of the root-knot nematode life cycle, though it is possible the component stages of the life cycle, e.g. egg development, host root invasion or growth, have slightly different optima. Species within the genus \"Meloidogyne\" also have different temperature optima. In \"M. javanica\", development occurs between 13 and 34 °C, with optimal development at about 29 °C.\n\nRoot-knot nematode females lay eggs into a gelatinous matrix produced by six rectal glands and secreted before and during egg laying. The matrix initially forms a canal through the outer layers of root tissue and later surrounds the eggs, providing a barrier to water loss by maintaining a high moisture level around the eggs. As the gelatinous matrix ages, it becomes tanned, turning from a sticky, colourless jelly to an orange-brown substance which appears layered.\n\nEgg formation in \"M. javanica\" has been studied in detail, and is similar to egg formation in the well studied, free-living nematode \"Caenorhabditis elegans\". Embryogenesis has also been studied, and the stages of development are easily identifiable with a phase contrast microscope following preparation of an egg mass squash. The egg is formed as one cell, with two-cell, four-cell and eight-cell stages recognisable. Further cell division leads to the tadpole stage, with further elongation resulting in the first stage juvenile, which is roughly four times as long as the egg. The J1 stage of \"C. elegans\" has 558 cells, and the J1 of \"M. javanica\" likely has a similar number, since all nematodes are morphologically and anatomically similar. The egg shell has three layers, with the vitelline layer outermost, then a chitinous layer and a lipid layer innermost.\n\nPreceded by induced changes in eggshell permeability, hatching may involve physical and/or enzymatic processes in plant-parasitic nematodes. Cyst nematodes, such as \"Globodera rostochiensis\", may require a specific signal from the root exudates of the host to trigger hatching. Root-knot nematodes are generally unaffected by the presence of a host, but hatch freely at the appropriate temperature when water is available. However, in an egg mass or cyst, not all eggs will hatch when the conditions are optimal for their particular species, leaving some eggs to hatch at a later date. Ammonium ions have been shown to inhibit hatching and to reduce the plant-penetration ability of \"M. incognita\" juveniles that do hatch.\n\nRoot-knot nematodes exhibit a range of reproductive modes, including sexuality (amphimixis), facultative sexuality, meiotic parthenogenesis (automixis) and mitotic parthenogenesis (apomixis).\n\n\n"}

She received a B.A. in poetry and philosophy from Bard College and a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Illinois. Originally a painter in the Abstract Expressionist tradition, Schneeman was uninterested in the masculine heroism of New York painters of the time and turned to performance-based work, primarily characterized by research into visual traditions, taboos, and the body of the individual in relation to social bodies. Although renowned for her work in performance and other media, Schneemann began her career as a painter, stating, \"I'm a painter. I'm still a painter and I will die a painter. Everything that I have developed has to do with extending visual principles off the canvas.\" Her works have been shown at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the London National Film Theatre, and many other venues.\n\nSchneemann taught at several universities, including the California Institute of the Arts, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Hunter College, and Rutgers University. Additionally, she published widely, producing works such as \"Cézanne, She Was a Great Painter\" (1976) and \"More than Meat Joy: Performance Works and Selected Writings\" (1997). Her works have been associated with a variety of art classifications including Fluxus, Neo-Dada, performance art, the Beat Generation, and happenings.\n\nCarolee Schneemann was born and raised in Fox Chase, Pennsylvania. As a child, her friends described her in retrospect as \"a mad pantheist\", due to her relationship with, and respect for, nature. As a young adult, Schneemann often visited the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where she cited her earliest connections between art and sexuality to her drawings from ages four and five, which she drew on her father's prescription tablets. Her family was generally supportive of her naturalness and freeness with her body. Schneemann attributed her father's support to the fact that he was a rural physician who had to often deal with the body in various states of health.\n\nSchneemann was awarded a full scholarship to New York's Bard College. She was the first woman from her family to attend college, but her father discouraged her from an art education. While at Bard, Schneemann began to realize the differences between male and female perceptions of each other's bodies while serving as a nude model for her boyfriend's portraits and while painting nude self-portraits. While on leave from Bard and on a separate scholarship to Columbia University, she met musician James Tenney, who was attending The Juilliard School.\n\nHer first experience with experimental film was through Stan Brakhage, Schneeman and Tenney's mutual friend. After graduating from Bard in 1962, Schneemann attended the University of Illinois for her graduate degree.\n\nSchneemann began her art career as a painter in the late 1950s. Her painting work began to adopt some of the characteristics of Neo-Dada art, as she used box structures coupled with expressionist brushwork. These constructs share the heavily textural characteristics found in the work of artists such as Robert Rauschenberg. She described the atmosphere in the art community at this time as misogynistic and that female artists of the time were not aware of their bodies. These works integrated influence by artists such as post-impressionist painter Paul Cézanne and the issues in painting brought up by the abstract expressionists. Schneemann chose to focus on expressiveness in her art rather than accessibility or stylishness. She still described herself as a formalist however, unlike other feminist artists who wanted to distance themselves from male-oriented art history. She is considered a \"first-generation feminist artist\", a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Rachel Rosenthal, and Judy Chicago. They were part of the feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art. Schneemann became involved with the art movement of happenings when she organized \"A Journey through a Disrupted Landscape\", inviting people to \"crawl, climb, negotiate rocks, climb, walk, go through mud\". Soon thereafter she met Allan Kaprow, the primary figure of happenings in addition to artists Red Grooms and Jim Dine. Influenced by figures such as Simone de Beauvoir, Antonin Artaud, Maya Deren, Wilhelm Reich, and Kaprow, Schneemann found herself drawn away from painting.\n\nIn 1962, Schneemann moved with James Tenney from their residence in Illinois to New York City when Tenney obtained a job with Bell Laboratories as an experimental composer. Through one of Tenney's colleagues at Bell, Billy Klüver, Schneemann was able to meet figures such as Claes Oldenburg, Merce Cunningham, John Cage and Robert Rauschenberg which got her involved with the Judson Memorial Church's art program. There, she participated in works such as Oldenburg's \"Store Days\" (1962), and Robert Morris's \"Site\" (1964) where she played a living version of Édouard Manet's \"Olympia\". She contributed to Oldenburg's happening, filmed by Stan VanDerBeek in upstate New York, \"Birth of the American Flag\" (1965). Around this time she began to self-represent her nude body in works, feeling that it needed to be seized back from the status of a cultural possession. Schneemann got to personally know many New York musicians and composers in the 1960s as well, including George Brecht, Malcolm Goldstein, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, and Steve Reich. She was also highly interested in the abstract expressionists of the time, such as Willem de Kooning. However, despite her numerous connections in the art world, Schneeman's painting-constructions did not generate interest from New York galleries and museums, though Oldenburg suggested that there would have been more interest from Europe. The first support for Schneemann's work came from poets such as Robert Kelly, David Antin, and Paul Blackburn who published some of her writings.\n\nProduction on Schneemann's work \"Eye Body\" began in 1963. Schneemann created a \"loft environment\" filled with broken mirrors, motorized umbrellas, and rhythmic color units. To become a piece of the art herself, Schneemann covered herself in various materials including grease, chalk, and plastic. She created 36 \"transformative-actions\" - photographs by Icelandic artist Erró of herself in her constructed environment. Included in these images is a frontal nude featuring two garden snakes crawling on Schneemann's torso. This image drew particular attention both for its \"archaic eroticism\" and her visible clitoris. Schneemann claimed that she did not know at the time of the symbolism of the serpent in ancient cultures in figures such as the Minoan Snake Goddess and, in fact, learned of it years later. Upon its presentation to the public in 1963, art critics found the piece to be lewd and pornographic. Artist Valie Export cites \"Eye Body\" for the way in which Schneemann portrays \"how random fragments of her memory and personal elements of her environment are superimposed on her perception.\"\n\nThe 1964 piece \"Meat Joy\" revolved around eight partially nude figures dancing and playing with various objects and substances including wet paint, sausage, raw fish, scraps of paper, and raw chickens. It was first performed at the Festival de la Libre Expression in Paris and was later filmed and photographed as performed by her Kinetic Theater group at Judson Memorial Church. She described the piece as an \"erotic rite\" and an indulgent Dionysian \"celebration of flesh as material.\" \"Meat Joy\" is similar to the art form happenings in that they both use improvisation and focused on conception, rather than execution. Though her work of the 1960s was more performance-based, she continued to build assemblages such as the Joseph Cornell-influenced \"Native Beauties\" (1962–64), \"Music Box Music\" (1964), and \"Pharaoh's Daughter\" (1966). Her \"Letter to Lou Andreas Salome\" (1965) expressed Schneemann's philosophical interests by combining scrawlings of Nietzsche and Tolstoy with a Rauschenberg-like form. Schneeman is quoted with saying about the piece, “Sensuality was always confused with pornography. The old patriarchal morality of proper behaviour and improper behaviour had no threshold for the pleasures of physical contact that were not explicitly about sex.”\n\nIn 1964, Schneemann began production of her 18-minute film \"Fuses\", eventually finishing it in 1967. \"Fuses\" portrayed Schneemann and her then-boyfriend James Tenney having sex as recorded by a 16 mm Bolex camera, as her cat, Kitch, observed nearby. Schneemann then altered the film by staining, burning, and directly drawing on the celluloid itself, mixing the concepts of painting and collage. The segments were edited together at varying speeds and superimposed with photographs of nature, which she juxtaposed against her and Tenney's bodies and sexual actions. \"Fuses\" was motivated by Schneemann's desire to know if a woman's depiction of her own sexual acts was different from pornography and classical art as well as a reaction to Stan Brakhage's \"Loving\" (1957), \"Cat's Cradle\" (1959) and \"Window Water Baby Moving\" (1959). Schneemann herself appeared in some Brakhage films, including \"Cat's Cradle\", in which she wore an apron at Brakhage's insistence. Despite her friendship with Brakhage, she later described the experience of being in \"Cat's Cradle\" as \"frightening,\" remarking that \"whenever I collaborated, went into a male friend's film, I always thought I would be able to hold my presence, maintain an authenticity. It was soon gone, lost in their celluloid dominance--a terrifying experience--experiences of true dissolution.\" She showed \"Fuses\" to her contemporaries as she worked on it in 1965 and 1966, receiving mostly positive feedback from her peers. Many critics described it as \"narcissistic exhibitionism\" and described it as self-indulgent. She received an especially strong reaction regarding the cunnilingus scene of the film. While \"Fuses\" is viewed as a \"proto-feminist\" film, Schneemann felt that it was largely neglected by feminist film historians. The film lacked the fetishism and objectification of the female body as seen in much male-oriented pornography. Two years after its completion, it won a Cannes Film Festival Special Jury Selection prize. Pop artist Andy Warhol, with whom Schneemann was acquainted, having spent time at The Factory, drolly remarked that Schneemann should have taken the film to Hollywood. \"Fuses\" became the first in Carolee Schneemann's \"Autobiographical Trilogy\". Though her works of the 1960s such as this shared many of the same ideas with the concurrent Fluxus artists, she remained independent of any specific movement. They formed the groundwork for the feminist art movement of the late 1960s and 1970s.\n\nSchneemann began work on the next film, \"Plumb Line\", in her \"Autobiographical Trilogy\" in 1968. The film opens with a still shot of a man's face with a plumb line in front of it before the entire image begins to burn. Various images including Schneemann and the man appear in different quadrants of the frame while a discombobulating soundtrack consisting of music, sirens, and cat noises among other things play in the background. The sound and visuals grow more intense as the film progresses, with Schneemann narrating about a period of physical and emotional illness. The film ends with Schneemann attacking a series of projected images and a repetition of the opening segment of the film. During a showing of \"Plumb Line\" at a women's film festival, the film was booed for the image of the man at the beginning of the film.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1976, in her ongoing piece \"Up to and Including Her Limits\", a naked Schneemann is suspended from a tree surgeon's harness, which is attached from the ceiling above a canvas. Using the motions of her body to make marks with a crayon, the artist maps time processes as a video monitor records the movement of the artist. She manually lowers and raises the rope in which she suspends, to reach all corners of the canvas. In this work, Schneemann addresses the male-dominated art world of Abstract Expressionism and Action painting, specifically work done by artists Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. Schneemann arrived at the museum when it opened with the cleaners, guards, secretaries, maintenance crew and remained until it closed. Through this practice the artist explored the political and personal implications of the museum space by enabling the place of art creation and art presentation to become one.[1] Schneemann intended to do away with performance, a fixed audience, rehearsals, improvisation, sequences, conscious intention, technical cues, and a central metaphor or theme in order to explore what is left. [2] In 1984, Schneemann completed the final video, a compilation of video footage from six performances: the Berkeley Museum, 1974; London Filmmaker's Cooperative, 1974; Artists Space, NY, 1974; Anthology Film Archives, NY, 1974; The Kitchen, NY, 1976; and the Studio Galerie, Berlin, 1976.[3]\n\nIn 1975, Schneemann performed \"Interior Scroll\" in East Hampton, New York and later that year, at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado. This was a notable Fluxus-influenced piece featuring her use of text and body. In her performance, Schneemann entered wrapped in a sheet, under which she wore an apron. She disrobed and then got on a table where she outlined her body with mud. Several times, she would take \"action poses\", similar to those in figure drawing classes. Concurrently, she read from her book \"Cézanne, She Was a Great Painter\". Following this, she dropped the book and slowly extracted from her vagina, a scroll from which she read. Schneeman's speech described a parody version of an encounter where she received criticism on her films for their “persistence of feelings” and “personal clutter”. Art Historian David Hopkins suggests that this performance was a comment on both “internalized criticism”, and possibly “feminist interest” in female writing.\n\nSchneemann's feminist scroll speech, according to performance theorist Jeanie Forte, made it seem as if \"[Schneemann]'s vagina itself is reporting [...] sexism\". Art critic Robert C. Morgan states that it is necessary to acknowledge the period during which \"Interior Scroll\" was produced in order to understand it. He argues that by placing the source of artistic creativity at the female genitals, Schneemann is changing the masculine overtones of minimalist art and conceptual art into a feminist exploration of her body. \"Interior Scroll\", along with Judy Chicago's \"Dinner Party\", helped pioneer many of the ideas later popularized by the off-broadway show \"The Vagina Monologues\". In 1978, Schneemann finished the last film, \"Kitch's Last Meal\", in what was later called her \"Autobiographical Trilogy\".\n\nSchneemann said that in the 1980s her work was sometimes considered by various feminist groups to be an insufficient response to many feminist issues of the time. Her 1994 piece \"Mortal Coils\" commemorated fifteen friends and colleagues who had died over the period of two years including Hannah Wilke, John Cage, and Charlotte Moorman. The piece consisted of rotating mechanisms from which hung coiled ropes while slides of the commemorated artists were shown on the walls.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1988, Schneemann's piece \"Infinity Kisses\" was put on display at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The wall installation consisting of 140 self-shot images, depicted Schneemann kissing her cat at various angles.\n\nIn December 2001, she unveiled \"Terminal Velocity\", which consisted of a group of photographs of people falling to their deaths from the World Trade Center following the September 11, 2001 attacks. Along with another of Schneemann's works which used the same images, \"Dark Pond\", Schneemann sought to \"personalize\" the victims of the attack. To achieve this, she digitally enhanced and enlarged the figures in the images, isolating the figures from the surroundings.\n\nSchneemann continued to produce art later in life, including the 2007 installation \"Devour\", which featured videos of recent wars contrasted with everyday images of United States daily life on dual screens.\n\nShe was interviewed for the 2010 film \"!Women Art Revolution\".\n\nOne of Schneemann's primary focuses in her work was the separation between eroticism and the politics of gender. Her cat Kitch, which was featured in works such as \"Fuses\" (1967) and \"Kitch's Last Meal\" (1978), was a major figure in Schneemann's work for almost twenty years. She used Kitch as an \"objective\" observer to her and Tenney's sexual activities, as she stated that she was unaffected by human mores. One of her later cats, Vesper, was featured in the photographic series \"Infinity Kisses\" (1986). In a wall-size collection of 140 photos, Schneemann documented her daily kisses with Vesper and documented \"the artist at life\". With numerous works foregrounding the centrality of feline companions in Schneemann's life, scholars now locate her work as significant for new accounts of human-animal relations.\n\nShe listed as an aesthetic influence on herself and James Tenney the poet Charles Olson, especially to the collage \"Maximus at Gloucester\" but also in general, \"in relationship to his concern for deep imagery, sustained metaphor, and also that he had been researching Tenney’s ancestors\", despite his occasional sexist comments.\n\nSchneemann considered her photographic and body pieces to still be based in painting despite appearing otherwise on the surface. She described herself as \"A painter who has left the canvas to activate actual space and lived time.\" She cited her studies with painter Paul Brach as teaching her to \"understand the stroke as an event in time\" and to think of her performers as \"colors in three dimensions.\" Schneemann took the ideas found in her figurative abstract paintings of the 1950s, where she cut and destroyed layers of paint from their surfaces, and transferred them to her photographic work \"Eye Body\". Art history professor Kristine Stiles asserts that Schneemann's entire oeuvre is devoted to exploring the concepts of figure-ground, relationality (both through use of her body), and similitude (through the use of cats and trees). Stiles asserts that the issues of sex and politics in Schneemann's work merely dictate how the art is shaped, rather than the formal concepts found behind it. For example, Schneemann relates the colors and movement featured in \"Fuses\" to brush strokes in painting. Her 1976 piece \"Up to and Including Her Limits\", too, invoked the gestural brush strokes of the abstract expressionists with Scheemann swinging from ropes and scribbling with crayons onto a variety of surfaces.\n\nSchneemann acknowledged that she was often labeled as a feminist icon and that she is an influential figure to female artists, but she also noted that she reached out to male artists as well. Though she was noted for being a feminist figure, her works explore issues in art and rely heavily on her broad knowledge of art history. Though works such as \"Eye Body\" were meant to explore the processes of painting and assemblage, rather than to address feminist topics, they still possess a strong female presence.\n\nIn Schneemann's earlier work, she is seen as addressing issues of patriarchal hierarchies in the 1950s American gallery space. Schneemann addressed these issues through various performance pieces that sought to create agency for the female body as being both sensual and sexual, while simultaneously breaking gallery space taboos of nude performances beginning in the 1960s.\n\nUnlike much other feminist art, Schneemann's revolves around sexual expression and liberation, rather than referring to victimization or repression of women. According to artist and lecturer Johannes Birringer, Schneemann's work resists the \"political correctness\" of some branches of feminism as well as ideologies that some feminists claim are misogynist, such as psychoanalysis. He also asserts that Schneemann's work is difficult to classify and analyze as it combines constructivist and painterly concepts with her physical body and energy. In her 1976 book \"Cézanne, She Was A Great Painter\", Schneemann wrote that she used nudity in her artwork to break taboos associated with the kinetic human body and to show that \"the life of the body is more variously expressive than a sex-negative society can admit.\" She also stated, \"In some sense I made a gift of my body to other women; giving our bodies back to ourselves.\" According to Kristine Stiles, Schneemann read several written works exploring the body's relationship with “sexuality, culture, and freedom,” such as \"The Theater and Its Double\" by Antonin Artaud, \"The Second Sex\" by Simone de Beauvoir, and \"The Sexual Revolution\" by Wilhelm Reich. These written works may have influenced her belief that women must represent themselves through writing about their experiences if they wished to gain equality. She preferred her term \"art istorical\" (without the \"h\"), so as to reject the \"his\" in history.\n\nMuch of Schneemann's work was performance-based: therefore photographs, video documentation, sketches, and artist's notes are often used to examine her work. It was not until the 1990s that Schneemann's work began to become recognized as a central part of the contemporary feminist art canon. The first prominent exhibition of her work was the modest 1996 retrospective \"Up To and Including Her Limits\", named for her 1973 work of the same title. It was held at New York City's New Museum of Contemporary Art and was organized by senior curator Dan Cameron. Previously, these works were dismissed as narcissism or otherwise overly sexualized forms of expression.\n\nCritic Jan Avgikos wrote in 1997, \"Prior to Schneemann, the female body in art was mute and functioned almost exclusively as a mirror of masculine desire.\" Critics have also noted that the reaction to Schneemann's work has changed since its original performance. Nancy Princenthal notes that modern viewers of \"Meat Joy\" are still squeamish about it; however, now the reaction is also due to the biting of raw chicken or to the men hauling women over their shoulders.\n\nSchneemann's work from the late 1950s continues to influence later artists such as Matthew Barney and untold numbers of others, especially women artists. \"Carolee's Magazine\" printed by the Artist's Institute in New York City highlights Schneeman's visual legacy through side-by-side comparisons with newer artists. Schneemann's work on the one side is juxtaposed with a work bearing signs of Schneeman's visual style on the other.\n\nCarolee Schneemann died at age 79 on March 6, 2019 after 2 decades of battling breast cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarolee Schneemann: Uncollected Texts\n\n"}

{"id": "1871011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871011", "title": "Holsworthy", "text": "Holsworthy\n\nHolsworthy is a small English market town and civil parish in the local government district of Torridge, Devon. The county town of Exeter is to the east. The River Deer, a tributary of the River Tamar, forms the western boundary of the parish, which includes the village of Brandis Corner. According to the 2011 census the population of Holsworthy was 2,641.\n\nThe original meaning of \"Holsworthy\" is probably \"Heald's enclosure\". Derived from the Old English personal name \"Heald\" or \"Healda\", plus \"-worthig\", an enclosure, farm or estate. An alternative possibility is from Old English \"heald\" meaning incline or slope. In 1086 the name was recorded as \"Haldeword\" and as \"Haldeurdi\" (Exon). Other recorded spellings are \"Haldwwurth\" 1228, \"Halleswrthia\" -worth(e) -wordi (late 12th–1291), \"Haldeswrthy\" -wrthi -worth (1277–1389), \"Holdesworthe\" (1308), \"Healdesworthe\" (c. 1320), \"Hyallesworthi\" (1326), and \"Houlsworthy\" (1675).\n\nHolsworthy is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \"Haldeword\". It was part of the Hundred of Black Torrington.\n\nIn 1066 the lord of the manor was Earl Harold and in 1066 it was William I. It was given by Henry II to Fulk Paganell. He gave it, with his daughter Gundred, to Matthew del Jartye. Their daughter and heiress brought it to Chaworth. Henry de Tracey purchased it from Chaworth, and it descended to the baronial family of Martyn. From them it passed by marriage to the lords Audley, and by an entail to the crown. King Edward III granted it to his son, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. John Holland, Duke of Exeter, possessed it by a grant from the Crown, and in 1487 the manor was given for life to Margaret, Countess of Richmond. In 1621 Sir John Speccot (d. 1645) of Speccot in the parish of Merton, Devon, Sheriff of Cornwall in 1622, was lord of the manor. After that it was purchased by the Prideaux family of Soldon, Holsworthy. In about 1713, the manor of Holsworthy was sold by Prideaux to Thomas Pitt, 1st Earl of Londonderry, from whom it descended to Earl Stanhope. In 1932 Holsworthy Urban District Council purchased the manorial rights from Lord Stanhope and so became lords of the manor.\nHolsworthy was part the Hundred of Black Torrington. In 1614 King James I granted a charter for an annual fair to be held in Holsworthy. During the English Civil War Holsworthy was held by Royalists forces until, on 17 February 1646, Sir Thomas Fairfax, after his victory at Torrington, sent a party to take possession of the town.\n\nIn the Second World War, Prisoner of War Camp No. 42 (Exhibition Field Camp) lay north of the town, near to what is now Park Close. German and Italian prisoners held there were employed as farm labourers.\n\nThe historic estate of Soldon, Holsworthy, was long a seat of a branch of the Prideaux family.\n\nThe earliest form of governance recorded for Holsworthy is that of a Court Leet. A charter, dated 1154, granted a \"Chartered Court Leet of the Ancient Manor of Holsworthy\". The court leet was one of the highest and oldest tribunals of English common law and was presided over by the Portreeve. The office of Portreeve had existed since Saxon times, when he served as governor of the town. The court was held periodically, normally annually, and attended by the residents of the district. It had jurisdiction over petty offences and the civil affairs of the district, and performed a number of administrative functions, such as collecting tolls and dues paid by traders and later military levies. The \"Port\" in Portreeve refers to a market town, a place of harbourage of goods, not of ships, and the \"reeve\" part indicates the chief magistrate of the town. The powers and duties of the Portreeve and Court Leet ceased when the statutory bodies of Petty Sessions (Magistrates Courts) and Parish Councils were created, to deal with criminal and civil matters, respectively.\n\nOn 1 April 1900 Holsworthy parish was split in two by the creation of Holsworthy Hamlets parish. The new parish consisted of the whole of Holsworthy parish with the exception of Holsworthy town. Two new councils were formed; Holsworthy Urban District Council for Holsworthy parish and Holsworthy Rural District Council for Holsworthy Hamlets. These councils, with others, were merged on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, to form the new Torridge district. Holsworthy Town Council, of 12 councillors, is chaired by the mayor, who is elected by the councillors annually. The council has responsibility for many local services, including maintenance of the town's footpaths, parks, gardens and war memorial. It also manages the weekly Pannier Market and organises the annual Holsworthy in Bloom competition.\n\nHolsworthy is in the East of the Torridge district of Devon. Neighbouring parishes are, to the West, Pyworthy, and Holsworthy Hamlets in other directions. Holsworthy is WSW of London and WNW of the county town of Exeter. The town is on the intersection of the A388 and A3072 roads. The town centre is about above sea level and the highest point in the parish has an elevation of . The river Deer, a tributary of the river Tamar, forms the western boundary of the parish.\n\nThe bedrock geology of the parish is entirely of Bude Formation. This type of Sedimentary bedrock was formed in the Carboniferous period. All of the parish is of Bude Formation (sandstone) except for a strip of Bude Formation (mudstone and siltstone), about wide, across the extreme north of the parish. The Bude Formation forms part of the Holsworthy Group.\n\nThe population of Holsworthy, according to the census of 1801, was 1,045. There was a steady growth in population reaching 1,857 in 1841. Over the next sixty years the population fell overall to 1,371 in 1901. Over the following sixty years the population rose gradually to 1,748 in 1971, dipped to 1,645 in 1981, and then rapidly grew to 2,641 in 2011, an increase of 60.54 per cent in thirty years.\n\nData for 1801–1991 is from Britain Through Time, data for 2001–2011 from the Office of National Statistics.\n\nHolsworthy has one of the largest livestock markets in South West England. The livestock market had been held on the same site from 1905 until 2014, when the site was sold for retail and residential development and the livestock market moved to an out-of-town site.\n\nHolsworthy is home to the only centralised anaerobic digestion facility in the UK. Turning dairy farm slurry into biogas, the plant has an installed capacity of 2.1 MW. There are proposals to provide low-cost heat to the householders of the town from the plant.\n\nThe town is part of the Ruby Country which covers 45 parishes around the market towns of Holsworthy and Hatherleigh. These two towns were at the centre of the 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak, and although agriculture was directly affected, most local businesses suffered considerable financial hardship. As a result, the Ruby Country Initiative was established, a not for profit partnership, to help create a more robust and sustainable local economy, and to create an identity for the area.\n\nSt Peter's Fair is held in July and lasts for four days (Wednesday to Saturday). Since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1752, with the resulting loss of eleven days, the fair has been held eleven days after the feast day of St Peter (29 June). On the first day of St Peter's Fair, the 1614 charter granting a fair by King James I is proclaimed by the town crier on the spot where the Great Tree of Holsworthy stood in Stanhope Square. A brass plaque in the road marks the site of the Great Tree.\n\nThe annual presentation of the \"Pretty Maid\" is made at noon on the first day of St Peter's Fair. Her identity is kept secret until she emerges through the church tower doorway to be greeted by the crowd of viewers of this unique ceremony. It is a result of a legacy made in the will of the Reverend Thomas Meyrick, of Carta Martha, near Launceston who died 27 May 1841. He was the brother of the Reverend Owen Lewis Meyrick (Rector of Holsworthy from 1766 to his death in 1819). Under the terms of the will, the legacy was to be invested to pay a dividend of £3 10s on 5 July annually to the churchwarden of Holsworthy. £2 10s of the dividend to be paid to a young single woman under the age of 30 and \"generally esteemed by the young as the most deserving, the most handsome, most noted for her qualities and attendance at church.\" The balance of £1 was to be paid to a spinster, not under 60 years of age, of the same qualities.\n\nThe annual, one day, Holsworthy and Stratton Agricultural Show is an important event for the town and the local farming community. The show began in 1883 as the Holsworthy and Stratton Agricultural Exhibition and the venue alternated between Stratton and Holsworthy. After World War II, a permanent site was purchased, north of Stanhope Park, and became known as the Show Field. The show was held in May and was the first in Devon's agricultural show season. It is now held at Killatree Cross, west of Holsworthy, on the third Thursday in August.\n\nA half-marathon, the Ruby Run, is held in June between the towns of Hatherleigh and Holsworthy. The starting point alternates between the two towns each year and attracts competitors from all over the South West. The first race was run on 15 June 2003 from Hatherleigh to Holsworthy.\n\nHolsworthy Vintage Vehicle and Engine Rally started in 1987 and has grown into a major two-day event that attracts exhibitors and visitors from a wide area. The rally is held on the last Saturday and Sunday of June.\n\nThe annual Carnival is held in November. The first was held in November 1900 as a replacement for the Guy Fawkes and bonfire celebration.\n\nHolsworthy is twinned with Aunay-sur-Odon in the Calvados department in the Lower Normandy region of north-west France. Aunay-Sur-Odon is south of Villers-Bocage, south-west of Caen, and north-east of Vire. The two communities visit each other's towns in alternate years.\n\nIn the centre of the town square stands a stone Market Cross, symbolising the right to trade. The cross which originally sat upon the top of the structure was broken off decades ago and has since been replaced by an ornate lamp.\n\nHolsworthy Community Hospital is situated in Dobles Lane to the north of the town. It was built in 1991 and is run by the Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust. The Hospital has one in-patient ward and an out-patients department. Nearby is Holsworthy Medical Centre, which serves Holsworthy and surrounding villages. A 'Minor Injury' service is provided during surgery hours. In December 2014, building started of The Long House, an outreach centre of North Devon Hospice in the grounds of the Medical Centre. It will enable patients to access care and support close to home without the need to travel to the hospice in Barnstaple.\n\nStanhope Park, with an area of , was donated to the town by James Stanhope, 7th Earl Stanhope. It is home to Holsworthy Cricket Club and Holsworthy Bowling Club. Since 2012 Stanhope Park has been protected as recreational space in perpetuity by Fields in Trust under the Queen Elizabeth ll Fields Challenge. In 2014 a new play park was opened. Holsworthy Primary School and Holsworthy College both use the park for sport and educational purposes.\n\nHolsworthy Library is on North Road, opposite the parish church.\n\nThe parish church of St Peter's and St Paul's is a Grade II* listed building. The first building on the site was probably a Norman Oratory built c. 1130 and replaced, c. 1250, by a church with tower, nave, south aisle and chancel built in the Early English style. The original Norman Church was small and occupied the site of the present nave.\n\nThe present church, built in the early English style, dates from the mid-13th century. Renovations in the late 19th century included the complete rebuilding of the chancel, the addition of a north aisle and the renovation of the nave and south aisle. The 15th century three-stage west tower houses a peal of eight bells and a carillon. The tower is 85.75 feet (26.14 m) high.\n\nThe south porch contains remnants of the original Norman building. On the east wall there is a carved stone holy water stoup and on the west wall there is a carved stone panel depicting the Agnus Dei, thought to be the centre of a tympanum above a Norman capital of a colonnette. Two Norman colonnettes, with Romanesque capitals are incorporated into the wall on each side of the doorway.\n\nThe church contains several stained-glass windows, including three by Lavers, Barraud and Westlake of London.\n\nThe organ is said to be by Renatus Harris and to have come from Chelsea Old Church (also known as All Saints). It was removed to Bideford in 1723 and brought to Holsworthy in 1865. Over the next two years it was restored and enlarged by the organ builders Geek and Sons of Launceston, Cornwall. On 27 June 1867 the organ was opened by Mr W. B. Gilbert of London, whom the \"Western Times\" described as \"one of the best organists of the day\".\n\nThe church is famous for being one of the few in the country with the Devil depicted in stained glass. It also gained fame from Samuel Sebastian Wesley's music, \"Holsworthy Church Bells\" – composed for the chiming drum. A legend states that the tower was built atop a live human sacrifice to ensure a strong foundation.\n\nThe Methodist Church, Bodmin Street was opened on 28 April 1910 as the United Methodist Church.\n\nA Grade II listed building, it was built in 1909–10 in the Early English style by two local building firms, Samuel Parsons (also the architect) and William F. Glover. The church, built on the site of an earlier chapel (c.1876), has the same appearance as the earlier chapel but with the addition of a two-stage octagonal crenelated tower with spire. At the base of the tower there is a two-light window. The gabled facade is of Bath stone with Plymouth limestone dressings. The gable ends are decorated with crocketed finials. The arch over the double doors, of the gabled porch, is inscribed \"United Methodist Church 1910\". The porch, which has a two-light window above, is flanked by two-light windows under continuous hood moulds. The church and hall have shallow raking buttresses and slate roofs with decorative ridge tiles. The interior is in the form of a four-bay apsidal basilica with a serpentine-curve gallery over the entrance. The gallery has pierced decorative wooden panels and is supported on cast-iron columns with decorative capitals. The five-bay hammer-beam, ceiled and boarded, roof has pierced braces, green marble corbels and metal ties. Four roof trusses converge at the apsial end. The organ, with stencilled pipes, was built in 1887 and later enlarged. Two stained-glass windows, one each side of the organ, are said to have been removed from the Wesleyan chapel in Chapel Street, Holsworthy. Other windows are filled with pastel-coloured glass of an Art Nouveau style. Internal fittings include a pitch pine pulpit, communion table and benches. The interior of the church is rendered and the internal doors are part-glazed with coloured glass. The gable fronted hall has a two-light window over the gabled porch, which is flanked by two-light windows.\n\nThere was a Catholic church, St Cuthbert Mayne Chapel of Ease, at Derriton, Holsworthy. After its closure in December 2005, the Catholic community began to celebrate Mass at Holsworthy parish church.\n\nDuring World War II, POW Camp No. 42 (Exhibition Field Camp) was situated at what is now Stanhope Close. The Church of St Peter now displays a crucifix, carved by a German POW, and also two hand-painted stained-glass windows made by Italian POWs, used in a hut which served as their Roman Catholic chapel.\nSchools in the town include Holsworthy Community College and Holsworthy CE Primary School.\n\nHolsworthy has a Non-League football club Holsworthy A.F.C., which plays at Upcott Field.\n\nHolsworthy Cricket Club was formed in 1873.\n\nHolsworthy has two main bus services, both operated by Stagecoach:\n\nThe railway arrived in 1879, and was operated by the Devon and Cornwall Railway Company. Holsworthy railway station was closed in 1966, but the viaducts built either side of Holsworthy remain.\n\nPeople from Holsworthy are known as Holsworthians. In order of birth:\n\n"}

The village lies in Lichfield District, and the council ward of Kings Bromley had a population of 1,651 at the time of the 2001 census. (although this area covers a few other small settlements in addition to the parish of Kings Bromley itself, including the villages of Hamstall Ridware and Elmhurst). The parish was in Offlow Hundred.\n\nThe population as of the 2011 census was measured at 1,163. The Norman village church, which dates back to at least 1170, is named All Saints.\nThe manor was anciently called \"Brom Legge\", and derived its present name from the circumstances of its being the property of the Crown for nearly two centuries after the Norman conquest, previous to which it had been distinguished as the residence of the Earls of Mercia. Leofric, the husband of the famous Lady Godiva, died here in 1057. Henry III granted the manor to the Corbetts, who sold it, in 1569, to Francis Agard, of Ireland. About 1670 it was sold by Charles Agard to John Newton, of the island of Barbados, and in 1794 it was bequeathed by Sarah Newton to her cousins, John & Thomas Lane. South of Kings Bromley at Bromley Hayes is a marina on the Trent and Mersey Canal.\n\nThe name of the village and parish seems to be spelled with or without the apostrophe fairly indiscriminately. Both \"King's Bromley\" and \"Kings Bromley\" are seen in official documents - the village's own website favours \"Kings Bromley\".\n\nKings Bromley has a long-standing Football Club \"Kings Bromley Swifts\" which has images dating back as far as 1903. In recent years \"The Swifts\" have played their football in the Burton Sunday League Division 1 but were promoted to the Premier Division in 2011/2012. Home games are played at Crawley Lane opposite Kings Bromley Cricket Club on the show field.\n\nIn recent history, Kings Bromley has had a total of three raids in a single year. One of which was on national newspapers, this has led to police investigations in the matter. Despite all of this, the crime still continues, with the most recent raid on 26 March 2018.\n\n\n"}

Beginning as a submarine eruption, it eventually built into a Surtseyan eruption that resulted in the formation of a circular island long and in altitude. Smoke and steam released by the eruption was visible from the islands of São Miguel and Terceira. The eruption also caused multiple small earthquakes felt on those islands.\n\nDesignated the \"Ilha Nova\" (New Island), it remained above sea-level for only two years, reaching a height of and diameter of . Marine erosion and ocean swells reduced and degraded the cone's size considerably, so that by 21 July 1722 the \"Conselho da Marinha Português\" (Portuguese Marine Council) was advised the island had disappeared (Oliveira, 1943).\n\nAfter two centuries of disputed references to the existence of the island, on 28 July 1941 the hydrographic ship \"NH D. João de Castro\" identified its position and cataloged the morphology of the bank. In keeping with nautical tradition, the bank inherited the discovering ship's name.\n\nIntense seismic activity in the area in 1997 suggests a small eruption may have occurred in that year.\n\nThe most recent seismic events from the region occurred from 4 June 2012, when incrementally increasing tremors affected the region. A maximum seismic event was recorded from the islands of São Miguel and Terceira, equivalent to levels III/IV on the Mercalli Scale.\n\nThe volcano remains seismically active between the islands of São Miguel and Terceira, rising to within of the sea surface. The volcano has a large fumarole field approximately in area. Volcanic gases released from the fumaroles are visible on the water's surface.\n\nTwo parasitic craters, both about wide, are located on the northwest flank. The younger crater displays a floor consisting of a chilled lava lake with polygonal surface fractures, while the older, less distinct crater is obscured by tephra deposits.\n\nD. João de Castro Bank showcases significant biodiversity, with approximately 220 identified species. Fish species observed near the bank include Bermuda chub (\"Kyphosus sectatrix\"), triggerfish (family \"Balistidae\"), needlefish (family \"Belonidae\"), wahoo (\"Acanthocybium solandri\"), and giant oceanic manta ray (\"Mobula birostris\"). The dominant species of aquatic flora are \"Sargassum\" seaweeds.\n\nThe bank is an important fishing ground for demersal fish, such as the black seabream (\"Spondyliosoma cantharus\") and blackbelly rosefish (\"Helicolenus dactylopterus\"), as well as pelagic tuna species (\"Thunnus\" and others).\n\nOn 27 July 1996, in a scientific expedition organized by the \"Clube Naval de Ponta Delgada\", marine biology researchers from the University of the Azores completed a study identifying species localized within the bank.\n\n\n\n"}

He is currently signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW) and Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA). In addition to AAA, Evans has wrestled for numerous independent promotions around the world, including Calgary's Stampede Wrestling, Ring of Honor, Dragon Gate, Combat Zone Wrestling, Lucha Underground, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, Pro Wrestling Noah and Wrestling Society X. He is a former PWG World Tag Team Champion and winner of the 2008 Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament (with Roderick Strong).\n\nEvans made his debut in September 2000 against Tiger Redding. He then began wrestling in the Matrats promotion, which was set up by Eric Bischoff. In mid-2003, Evans broke his ankle, before competing for Stampede Wrestling after recovering. He also wrestled for Major League Wrestling (MLW) in 2003 and early 2004. He challenged for the MLW Junior Heavyweight Championship, losing a singles match to the champion Sonjay Dutt, and also unsuccessfully participating in a four-way match, also involving Dutt, Puma and Chasyn Rance. During his time in MLW, he also wrestled under a mask as \"Dark Fuego\" to team with Pete Wilson.\n\nEvans made his Ring of Honor debut on November 1, 2003, at \"Main Event Spectacles\", where he wrestled in a Scramble Cage match with Teddy Hart, won by The Backseat Boyz, and which also included Special K, The S.A.T., and The Carnage Crew. The match was highly praised, and featuring Evans performing a 720° moonsault off the top of the cage, making him one of the first people to do a moonsault with two full rotations. Following the match, Evans was involved in an altercation with Samoa Joe.\n\nOn May 22, 2004, Evans turned into a villainous character by joining Generation Next faction with Alex Shelley, Austin Aries, and Roderick Strong. Generation Next felt that they were the top athletes in ROH, and they were going to take the top spots in the company any way they could. For the rest of 2004, Generation Next feuded with the likes of the Second City Saints and Ricky Steamboat, as well as others in the ROH roster. At \"Final Battle\", Aries confronted Shelley after he lost a tag match with Strong to CM Punk and Steve Corino. Aries told Shelley to step down as the leader of Generation Next, and then attacked him before Shelley could answer. Strong pulled Aries off Shelley, but then turned around and helped in the beat down. Evans was not present for the event and did not return for the next several shows, leaving into questioning if he would side with Shelley or Aries and Strong. He returned at part one of the \"Third Anniversary Show\" on February 19, 2005, teaming up with Strong to face The Ring Crew Express, The Carnage Crew, and Special K (Izzy and Deranged) in a Scramble Cage match. On February 26, Evans lost in a match against Alex Shelley. Following the match, all three members of Generation Next attacked Shelley.\nOn December 12, 2004, Blitzkrieg gave his gimmick and mask to Evans. Since then, Evans competes on occasion as Blitzkrieg II.\n\nOn March 5, Generation Next competed in the Trios Tournament. They won their first two matches, defeating the team of Davey Andrews, Shane Hagadorn, and Anthony Franco (students of the Ring of Honor wrestling school) in the first round, and the team of the Second City Saints (CM Punk and Colt Cabana) and Steve Corino in the second round. Generation Next lost in the finals, however, against The Rottweilers (Homicide, Ricky Reyes and Rocky Romero).\n\nGeneration Next spent most of 2005 feuding with Alex Shelley. Shelley, due to his actions while he was the leader of Generation Next, was unable to find many allies in the ROH locker room and was left to defend himself against Generation Next. Eventually, Prince Nana offered him a spot in The Embassy, but he refused, although he soon changed his mind. Shelley joining the Embassy turned Generation Next into faces and the two factions continued to wage war on each other for the rest of the year. On August 12, Generation Next added Matt Sydal to the group, as well as his valet Daizee Haze. Generation Next soon had another valet when Jade Chung, tired of the way she was being abused by Prince Nana, turned on the Embassy. On November 5, Haze betrayed Generation Next and joined the Embassy. The Generation Next/Embassy feud ended on December 3, in a steel cage elimination match, with Generation Next emerging victorious.\n\nIn 2004, wrestling promoter and personality \"Coach\" Scott D'Amore brought together fellow Canadians to form his own incarnation of Team Canada in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) for 2004 American and World X-Cup Tournaments. Evans, despite being American, was added to the team, which was composed of Teddy Hart as team captain and both Johnny Devine and Petey Williams as his teammates. When the World X-Cup was announced, the team was revamped to add power to the speed and agility in the previous incarnation of the team, with Hart and Evans being replaced by Eric Young and Bobby Roode. The team made it to the finals, which was an Ultimate X match, but lost to Team USA (Jerry Lynn, Chris Sabin, Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper).\n\nAs part of the working agreement between AAA and TNA, Evans made his return to TNA on June 28, 2011 at the tapings of the edition of July 7 of \"Impact Wrestling\", defeating Jesse Sorensen and Tony Nese in a three–way match to advance to a four–way match for a TNA contract at Destination X. At the pay-per-view, Evans was defeated in the finals by Austin Aries.\n\nThat same month, Evans and Roderick Strong toured Japan with the Dragon Gate promotion. Starting in April 2006, Evans moved to Japan for three months to train and wrestle with the Dragon Gate promotion. In Dragon Gate, Evans became a member of CIMA's Blood Generation faction. 2006 brought changes for Evans and ROH, as Austin Aries and Roderick Strong were the tag team champions while Evans and Matt Sydal began to work more in Japan. On March 30, Generation Next lost to the Dragon Gate stable Blood Generation. With Sydal and Evans touring in Japan, Roderick Strong and Austin Aries announced at the June 3 Ring of Honor show that there was no longer a need for Generation Next. Evans teamed with Aries, Strong, and Sydal one last time on July 29 at \"Generation Now\", losing to the team of Davey Richards, Jerelle Clark, and The Irish Airborne. Following with match, Evans, Aries, Strong, and Sydal laid down their Generation Next shirts in the middle of the ring, officially ending Generation Next. Evans stayed in Japan for the rest of 2006, wrestling for Dragon Gate. He returned to ROH on January 26, 2007 in Braintree, Massachusetts, defeating Eddie Edwards.\n\nAfter returning to ROH, Evans began feuding with Roderick Strong and his No Remorse Corps faction. In order to combat the numbers of the No Remorse Corps, Evans enlisted Ruckus, Jigsaw and Julius Smokes to form his own faction known as The Vulture Squad. Evans announced Ruckus and Smokes as members on August 25, at \"Manhattan Mayhem II\" after competing against Austin Aries and Strong in a triple threat match, won by Aries, and Jigsaw joined a few weeks later. On December 20 at \"Final Battle 2007\", Mercedes Martinez joined The Vulture Squad, and Evans named her \"The Booty Vulture\". The Vulture Squad was scheduled to face The Briscoe Brothers at \"Breakout\" in January 2008, but Evans suffered a severe facial injury in Dragon Gate due to a kick from Human Tornado prior to the event while Ruckus missed the show due to pneumonia. They were instead replaced with Vulture Squad member Jigsaw and Matt Cross.\n\nIn 2006, Evans taped episodes on Wrestling Society X, which aired on MTV in 2007. In the company's first televised match on the inaugural episode, Evans defeated Matt Sydal. On the following episode, he defeated El Hombre Blanco Enmascarado. In a later episode he defeated Scorpio Sky. His most notable feud was with the Human Tornado. The two tied in a \"dance off\" and had a 10-minute time limit draw on the ninth episode of the show.\n\nIn 2008, Evans joined AAA as a member of the villainous group La Legión Extranjera (The Foreign Legion), led by Konnan. Upon joining AAA, Evans began re-teaming with Teddy Hart as The Hart Foundation 2.0. During this time, Evans along with Hart came close to winning the AAA World Tag Team Championships on several occasions.\n\nStarting in May and throughout the beginning of June 2009, Evans and Hart began to have issues as a team. After a match in a tournament for the Cruiserweight Championship against Xtreme Tiger, the team finally broke up. After the breakup, many members of La Legión assaulted Evans before ousting him from the group. Following his departure from the group, Evans joined Team AAA and thus became a fan favorite, representing the named owner of AAA who was fighting Konnan for control of the company. At Triplemania XVII Evans and Team AAA defeated La Legión Extranjera to win control of AAA and force Konnan out of the company. Evans returned to Ring of Honor on December 19, 2009, at the company's first live pay-per-view, Final Battle 2009, where he defeated his AAA nemesis, Teddy Hart.\n\nOn June 6, 2010, at Triplemania XVIII Evans defeated Christopher Daniels, Extreme Tiger and Nosawa in a four-way elimination match to win the AAA Cruiserweight Championship. On March 21, 2011, Evans teamed with Extreme Tiger to defeat \"Los Maniacos\" (Silver King and Último Gladiador) for the AAA World Tag Team Championship, making Evans a double champion. Evans and Tiger made their first successful defense of the title on June 18 at Triplemanía XIX, defeating the TNA team of Abyss and Mr. Anderson in a steel cage match. On September 16, the 467th day of his reign as the AAA Cruiserweight Champion, Evans made his first title defense, defeating Escoria. On October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, Evans and Tiger lost the AAA World Tag Team Championship to Abyss and Chessman in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Afterwards, Evans began feuding with \"Los Perros del Mal\" leader El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, pinning him in back-to-back tag team matches on November 14 and 26. On December 16 at Guerra de Titanes, Evans and Aguayo continued their rivalry in a six-man tag team match, during which they busted each other open. Eventually, Aguayo's team won the match, when Héctor Garza pinned Fénix. On March 18, 2012, at \"Rey de Reyes\", Evans faced Aguayo and two other \"Perros del Mal\", Garza and L.A. Park, in the finals of the \"Rey de Reyes\". Despite managing to outlast both Park and Garza, Evans was eventually pinned by Aguayo for the win. On May 19, Evans lost the AAA Cruiserweight Championship to Juventud Guerrera in a four-way hardcore match, which also included Psicosis and Teddy Hart, ending his reign at 713 days. On August 5 at \"Triplemanía XX\", Evans reunited with Hart for one night to take part in a \"Parejas Suicidas\" steel cage match, featuring three other former tag teams. However, both Evans and Hart managed to escape the cage and avoid having to face each other in a \"Lucha de Apuestas\" Hair vs. Hair match.\n\nIn early 2013, Evans formed the \"Los Güeros del Cielo\" (\"The Sky Blondes\") tag team with South African wrestler Angélico. On October 18 at \"Héroes Inmortales VII\", Evans and Angélico won a four-way match to become the new AAA World Tag Team Champions. On December 7, 2014, at Guerra de Titanes Angélico and Evans lost the AAA World Tag Team Championships to Joe Líder and Pentagón Jr. in a three-way tag team match that also included Fénix and Myzteziz. Evans and Ángelico then entered a feud with Dark Cuervo and Dark Escoria, which culminated on June 14, 2015, at Verano de Escándalo, where Evans and Ángelico were victorious in a steel cage \"Lucha de Apuestas\". As per stipulation, Cuervo and Escoria were forced to have their heads shaved following the match. On October 4, 2015, at Héroes Inmortales IX, Evans and Angélico regained the AAA World Tag Team Championship from Líder and Pentagón Jr. in a three-way match, also involving Daga and Steve Pain. They vacated the title on January 22, 2016, due to Angélico suffering a leg injury. On July 17, 2016, Evans and Angélico won the AAA World Tag Team Championship for the third time. On September 29, 2016, Evans criticized AAA and fellow wrestler La Parka during an interview with Solowrestling.com. A few days later, AAA removed him from all shows. On October 22, 2016, Evans left AAA.\n\nOn May 13, 2015 Evans made his Lucha Underground debut where he was defeated by Aero Star. On June 3 Evans got his first win against Argenis. On May 25, 2016 Evans teamed with Johnny Mundo and PJ Black, forming a group known as \"Worldwide Underground\", to defeat Dragon Azteca Jr., Prince Puma and Rey Mysterio for the Lucha Underground Trios Championship.

It was co developed with Volvo, sharing its chassis with the first generation of the Volvo S40, and built at the NedCar factory in Born, Netherlands, which the two companies co owned at the time. Over 350,000 were built during its production run. \n\nThe car was judged to be a reliable and economical vehicle but lacked visual appeal and competed by price and size in two very competitive markets without a strong selling point.\n\nAvailable as a four door saloon or a five door hatchback style only, it featured inline four gasoline engines from 1.3 L (introduced later in life) to 1.8 L, a 1.8 L gasoline direct injection engine, and 1.9 L turbodiesel powerplants sourced from Renault, later with the 1.9 DI-D common rail diesel engine, the same as used in both Volvo and Renault cars.\nIn spite of its name, the Carisma had a fairly neutral design as a result of being Mitsubishi's first attempt to target the traditionally conservative European company car market, where it competed with the likes of the Ford Mondeo.\n\nEven when receiving a midlife facelift in 1999, that characteristic was not improved. The car underwent a very light redesign again in 2002, with the main difference being the new headlights.

{"id": "1871081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871081", "title": "Livingston Avenue Bridge", "text": "Livingston Avenue Bridge\n\nThe Livingston Avenue Bridge is a railroad bridge over the Hudson River in New York connecting Albany and Rensselaer. The original structure was built in 1866 by the Hudson River Bridge Company but was replaced in 1901–02. A rotating swing bridge span allows large ships to proceed up the river.\n\nThe New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) has identified the bridge as a critical link in its Empire Corridor passenger rail line, and has initiated a study project for bridge rehabilitation or replacement.\n\nThe bridge was purchased from CSX in December 2012 as part of Amtrak's Empire Corridor lease. The lease grants Amtrak ownership and control over the bridge and adjoining 100 miles of track, extending east from Hoffmans, NY to Albany-Rensselaer station, then south to MP 75, just north of Poughkeepsie, NY. A small branch extends east from Albany-Rensselaer station down the Post-Road subdivision, where Amtrak's ownership terminates just south of the Interstate 90 Berkshire Spur overpass. The Livingston Avenue Bridge is most frequently used for east-west travel in New York, as well as freight trains of CSX and CP Rail. The bridge hosts an active railroad interlocking tower and Amtrak block operators staff the tower 24 hours a day. They are responsible for directing rail traffic around Amtrak's Rensselaer Terminal and nearby trackage as well as opening and closing the bridge. Due to the deteriorated condition of the bridge, trains cross one at a time at . DOT considers the swing bridge mechanism to be unreliable and the overall bridge design inadequate for current railroad operating standards. The bridge opens for ship traffic about 400 times per year.\n\nThe Hudson River Bridge Company was incorporated April 9, 1856. Work on the bridge was begun in April 1864. The earlier Green Island Bridge had opened to the north in Troy in 1835, but required the longer route of the Schenectady and Troy Railroad west from Troy. The new bridge, called the Hudson River Bridge, was to connect directly to the New York Central Railroad on the west (Albany) side of the bridge and to the Hudson River Railroad, Troy and Greenbush Railroad and Boston and Albany Railroad on the east (Rensselaer) side. The turntable bridge was 4800 feet (1500 m) long, with a clearance of 30 feet (9 m) from high water when closed.\n\nThe first engine, the \"Augustus Schell\", passed over the bridge on February 18, 1866. Passenger trains started using it on February 22. After the Maiden Lane Bridge was constructed a bit further south, the Hudson River Bridge was used mostly for freight trains and the few passenger trains that passed by Albany but did not need to stop there. The Maiden Lane Bridge was often referred to as the \"South Bridge\" and the Hudson River Bridge as the \"North Bridge\". In the winter of 1866, once travel patterns were set, Cornelius Vanderbilt, owner of the Hudson River Railroad, suddenly refused to allow any transfers from the New York Central. According to the documentary \"The Men Who Built America\" the motivation for this closure was retaliation against the owners of New York Central for negotiating a new contract in bad faith. The New York Central board gave in, and in 1867 Vanderbilt acquired the company, and in 1869 merged it with the Hudson River Railroad to form the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. This gave the New York Central a majority of ownership in the company; in 1900 the New York Central leased the Boston and Albany.\n\nThe current bridge was constructed in 1901-2 and was named the Livingston Avenue Bridge. At the time the original Hudson River Bridge was constructed Livingston Avenue had been named Lumber Street, as it led to the Albany Lumber District.\n\nAs of 2012, DOT is evaluating whether to rehabilitate or replace the structure. The cost to replace the bridge was estimated at $50 million in 1998. Decisions about rehabilitation will include consideration of upgrading the bridge to accommodate high-speed rail traffic. Funding for construction has not yet been allocated. One matter of contention is whether the project will restore the closed public walkway over the bridge. Doing so would greatly improve pedestrian access between Albany and Rensselaer, but the bridge owner, CSX, is citing safety concerns.\n\n\n\n"}

He is a member of the Unite Trade Union, the Co-operative Party and the Christians on the Left.\n\nBorn and brought up in Manchester, Gwynne was educated at Egerton Park Community High School (now called Denton Community College) in Denton, Tameside College of Technology in Ashton-under-Lyne, North East Wales Institute of Higher Education in Wrexham from 1992 to 1995 and the University of Salford from 1995 to 1998, earning a BA in Politics and Contemporary History.\n\nAt the age of 21 Gwynne became England's youngest councillor, when on 2 May 1996 he was elected to Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council, representing the Denton West Ward for the Labour Party. He was re-elected in 2000 and 2004, when he topped the poll in an \"all out\" election resulting from boundary changes in the borough. From 1998 to 2001 he chaired the Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly, and during 2003–04 he chaired the Resources and Community Services Scrutiny Panel.\n\nOn 5 May 2005, at the age of 30, Gwynne became the youngest Labour MP in the 2005 Parliament.\n\nHe was appointed to the House of Commons Procedure Committee in June 2005 and, despite having only been elected six months earlier, on 10 November 2005, Gwynne was promoted to become a Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to The Baroness Scotland of Asthal QC, as Minister of State for Criminal Justice and Offender Management at the Home Office. Between July 2007 and June 2009, he served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Home Secretary, the Rt Hon Jacqui Smith MP. During this period he was also elected chair of Labour Friends of Israel, and led delegations of British MPs to Israel and the Palestinian territories. In June 2009, he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, then Ed Balls.\n\nIn October 2010 Gwynne became a Shadow Transport Minister with responsibility for passenger transport. In the Opposition front bench reshuffle of October 2011 he was appointed to the Shadow Health team by Ed Miliband. He was reappointed in September 2015, following the election of Jeremy Corbyn as party leader.\n\nGwynne is involved in the campaign for justice for the victims and families of the tainted blood scandal, reaffirming his commitment to the cause on World AIDS Day 2016. He said in 2016: \"This scandal saw thousands of people die, and thousands of families destroyed through the negligence of public bodies\".\n\nGwynne took a leading role in organising Labour in the Oldham West and Royton by-election in 2015. Gwynne said he hoped that \"I can do the memory of Michael Meacher proud by helping to return a Labour MP for the seat\". The Labour candidate Jim McMahon held the seat with a 10,000-plus majority and increased the party's share of the vote.\n\nAndy Burnham chose Gwynne to run Burnham's mayoral campaign in Greater Manchester. After supporting Burnham's successful attempt to be selected as Labour's candidate over the favourite, Tony Lloyd, Gwynne remained as lead on Burnham's campaign in 2017.\n\nIn 2018 Gwynne was named as a member of a Facebook group sharing anti-Semitic material. When a reporter confronted him about the group he admitted that he was a member, but stated he had been added to it without his permission He is a member of Labour Friends of Israel.\n\nIn 2010 Gwynne introduced the Debt Relief (Developing Countries) Act to restrict the activities of \"vulture funds\". Vulture funds buy the debts of poor countries, usually at a significant discount, and wait until the government has received relief from foreign creditors. As debtor countries have usually long defaulted on the loans, the vultures sue for the full debt – plus costs and interest – in courts around the world. This legislation prevents vulture funds from making exorbitant profits out of debt restructuring of heavily indebted poor countries, limiting how much vulture funds can sue for in UK courts to the amount they would have got if they had taken part in debt relief. The UK government has estimated that the Act will help to save 145 million pounds over six years. Similar legislation has now been passed in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.\n\nIn 2016 Gwynne was invited to give a keynote speech on ways to tackle vulture funds and the damage they cause to developing nations at the 135th Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Geneva.\n\nGwynne was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet in October 2016, working in the opposition Cabinet Office team and becoming the spokesperson for the Shadow Cabinet in media appearances. In November 2016 he took a key role in helping to reform the proposed constituency boundaries in the Parliamentary Constituencies (Amendment) Bill drawn up by MP Pat Glass, and presented the Disability Equality Training (Taxi and Private Hire Vehicle Drivers) Bill, which sought to provide support to disabled users of taxi services. The Bill received cross party support, but due to a filibuster by two Conservative MPs, Sheryll Murray and Tom Pursglove, it was not voted on.\n\nIn 2017 Gwynne was appointed to lead Labour's campaign for the Copeland by-election following the resignation of Jamie Reed. Gwynne focused the campaign on Conservatives plans to cut services at West Cumberland Hospital and to move some hospital facilities, including maternity services, to Carlisle, 80 miles away.\n\nIn February 2017 Gwynne was promoted to Elections and Campaign Chair while retaining some of his Cabinet Office duties and his role as a spokesperson. He shares his new post with Ian Lavery.\n\nDuring the 2017 general election campaign Gwynne clashed with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Sky News, calling Johnson a \"pillock\" in a debate over Brexit policy.\n\nFollowing the 2017 general election, Gwynne retained his role as Elections and Campaign Chair, and was promoted to become Shadow Communities and Local Government Secretary, replacing Grahame Morris.. \n\nIn the 2019 UK General Election, he kept his seat in Parliament but his majority was halved. In 2020, one day after Keir Starmer was elected as the new labour leader, he resigned from his position as Shadow Communities and Local Government Secretary. \n\nHe is the son of sports commentator and reporter John Gwynne. He married Allison Dennis in March 2003 in Tameside, and they have two sons and a daughter. Allison Gwynne serves as a councillor for Denton North East Ward of Tameside Council.\n\nGwynne has talked about experiencing depression at points during his political life, as well as suffering a pulmonary embolism.\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation between 1999 and 2001 as a member of The Mean Street Posse.\n\nGasparino grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut. He attended Greenwich High School, where he was a friend of Shane McMahon, the son of the chairman of the World Wrestling Federation. He went on to attend the University of Connecticut on an athletic scholarship, playing football for the Connecticut Huskies. After graduating, Gasparino spoke to McMahon in 1992 about becoming a professional wrestler, but McMahon discouraged him. Gasparino instead went into business, eventually joining Lightnin Rentals, a film production equipment hire company, in New York City.\n\nIn early-1999, Shane McMahon asked Gasparino and their mutual friend Rodney Leinhardt to film a series of vignettes about their upbringing in Greenwich to promote his match with X-Pac at WrestleMania XV. The tongue-in-cheek vignettes bragged about the toughness of McMahon and his friends from the \"mean streets\" of Greenwich. Renamed \"Pete Gas\", Gasparino (along with Rodney and two other childhood friends of Shane, \"Billy P\" and \"Willie Greene\") made his live debut in the WWF on the March 22, 1999 episode of \"Raw\", interfering in a street fight between McMahon and X-Pac. Dubbed \"The Mean Street Posse\", Gas and the others went on to appear in McMahon's corner at WrestleMania XV on March 28, 1999, helping him defeat X-Pac.\n\nAfter Gas and Rodney had made several appearances with the WWF, they were offered one-year contracts. Gas left his job, becoming a full-time performer with the WWF. He was trained as a wrestler by Tom Prichard. Playing on their \"preppy\" image, the Posse members wrestled in argyle sweater vests and khakis. Inspired by the Socs, a gang of wealthy teenagers from the 1983 film \"The Outsiders\", the Mean Street Posse were comedic villains: \"the rich kids that everyone hated\".\n\nFollowing WrestleMania XV, The Mean Street Posse were drawn into the feud between Shane McMahon and his father Vince, resulting in them facing Vince McMahon's \"stooges\", Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson in a series of matches. On the April 29, 1999 episode of \"Smackdown\", The Mean Street Posse became members of The Corporate Ministry. On the May 10, 1999 episode of \"Raw\", Gas and Rodney lost to Brisco and Patterson in a loser leaves town match. The television ratings for the segment the match appeared in were at that time the highest ever recorded for a WWF television program. They returned on the June 7, 1999 episode of \"Raw\". On June 21, 1999, Gas and Rodney were joined by Joey Abs, turning The Mean Street Posse from a tag team into a stable. Unlike Gas and Rodney, Abs was not a childhood friend of Shane McMahon; instead, he was an experienced wrestler added to the group as a ringer.\n\nIn July 1999, Shane McMahon and The Mean Street Posse began feuding with Test after he began dating McMahon's sister Stephanie. This culminated in a \"love her or leave her\" match between McMahon and Test at SummerSlam on August 22, 1999, with Test to end his relationship with Stephanie if he lost and McMahon to drop his opposition to the relationship if he lost. Test defeated McMahon despite the efforts of the Posse, who were seated at ringside. McMahon reconciled with Test on the September 9 episode of \"Smackdown\", but the Posse refused to do likewise, resulting in them ending their alliance with McMahon after he rescued Test from an attack at their hands on the September 13, 1999 episode of \"Raw\".\n\nAfter parting ways with McMahon, the Posse were briefly managed by Terri Runnels before allying with The British Bulldog. On November 14, 1999 at Survivor Series, The British Bulldog and The Mean Street Posse lost to Gangrel, Mark Henry, Steve Blackman, and Val Venis in the titular match.\n\nOn December 12, 1999 at Armageddon, The Mean Street Posse took part in a tag team battle royal to become number one contenders to the WWF Tag Team Championship. They gained an advantage by switching places with the third wrestler behind the referees' backs, thus enabling them to outnumber the other teams three to two, but nonetheless failed to win.\n\nIn early 2000, the Posse repeatedly tried to defeat Crash Holly for the Hardcore Championship, attacking the champion in unlikely venues such as an airport, a circus, and his hotel room. At WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, the trio took part in a hardcore battle royal for the title. During the match, each member would briefly hold the title, although Hardcore Holly ultimately won the match and left as the official champion.\n\nOn an episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\" later that year, Edge and Christian briefly became the managers of the Mean Street Posse. They accompanied them to ringside for the duration of their WWF World Tag Team Championship title match with the Hardy Boyz, assisting the Posse with the proviso that they would receive a title shot if the Posse was to win. The Hardy Boyz thwarted the interference of Edge and Christian, however, and retained their titles.\n\nIn mid-2000, Gas and the other Posse members were sent to Memphis Championship Wrestling, the WWF's developmental territory in Memphis, Tennessee, for seasoning. The trio trained in Memphis from Wednesday to Sunday then joined the rest of the roster for \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" tapings on Monday and Tuesday. Gas and Rodney won the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship in May 2000, defeating Bull Pain and Todd Morton. They lost the championship to The Kingpins in July 2000, but regained them the following month. Their second reign ended in October 2000 when they lost to The Dupps.\n\nDuring his time in Memphis, Gas also wrestled for Power Pro Wrestling, another Memphis-based independent promotion affiliated with the WWF. In March 2001, he won the PPP Heavyweight Championship. The championship was abandoned later the same month when Power Pro Wrestling closed.\n\nAfter several months in Memphis, Gas was sent to Puerto Rico. He and the other Posse members were released by the WWF in 2001. Gas went on to briefly wrestle on the independent circuit before retiring later that year.\n\nAfter retiring from professional wrestling, Gasparino worked as a bond broker. He currently works for office supply company W.B. Mason as a sales representative and has since 2003. In his book he mentions that it is a very long commute.\n\nGasparino broke his retirement for a single night in 2003, facing Prince Nana in a bout for the East Coast Wrestling Association in Wilmington, Delaware. In 2007, he appeared on the 15th anniversary episode of \"Raw\", competing in a Battle Royal, where he was eliminated by Bart Gunn. In 2016, Gasparino made several appearances on \"The Edge and Christian Show\", a sketch comedy show on the WWE Network hosted by retired wrestlers Christian and Edge. In 2017, he published his autobiography: \"Looking at the Lights: My Path from Fan to a Wrestling Heel\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film is directed by Rick Rosenthal. The original music score was composed by Bill Conti.\n\nMick O'Brien is a 16-year-old Irish-American hoodlum from Chicago. While most of Mick's crimes involve snatching purses, vandalism, and getting into brawls, he aspires to bigger and meaner things, which leads him to attempt ripping off a Puerto Rican rival, Paco Moreno. Everything goes wrong: Mick's partner and best friend Carl is killed, and Mick, while trying to escape the police, accidentally runs over and kills an eight-year-old boy who happens to be Paco's brother. \n\nMick is sent to the Rainford Juvenile Correctional Facility rather than a state prison for adults. Most of the wardens and counselors seem to have lowered themselves to the role of zookeepers. One exception is Ramon Herrera, a former gang member who talks tough to the inmates, but holds out hope for some of them, especially Mick.\n\nMick's cellmate is Barry Horowitz, a small, wiry, brainy Jewish kid who firebombed a bowling alley after some boys there severely beat him for flirting with their girlfriends. Their cell block is dominated by a pair of brawny sadists named \"Viking\" Lofgren and Warren \"Tweety\" Jerome, who take an immediate dislike to Mick. Mick puts up with them at first, but after he witnesses Tweety killing a small boy by throwing him off the catwalk (the small boy tried to stab Tweety in retaliation for raping him), he refuses to be intimidated by them. \n\nWhen Tweety and Viking go into Mick's cell to attack him, Mick beats them bloody with a pillowcase full of soda cans. His victory over Viking and Tweety earns him the respect of the block and recognition as the new \"barn boss\". Meanwhile, to avenge his brother's death, Paco rapes Mick's girlfriend J. C. \n\nAfter hearing of the rape, Mick is desperate to see her, so he and Horowitz escape the double perimeter fences during football practice through the use of a corrosive paste placed on the fences, making the fences weak enough to kick open. Mick escapes, but Horowitz falls on barbed wire and is then caught where a counselor beats him up for calling him names and escaping. Ramon believes that Mick had gone to J. C.'s house, and soon picks him up. He then takes him on a trip to a maximum-security prison to show what's in store for him, should he continue down the path of crime.\n\nAfter Paco's arrest upon the police finding out about the rape on J. C., he is sentenced to the same dormitory at Rainford that Mick is in. The staff are fully aware of this potential danger, but no other reform school has a vacancy. Paco attempts to provoke Mick into a fight, but Mick avoids the confrontation as he has a chance of early release if he stays out of trouble. However, he also loses the respect of many of the inmates, who now want to see Paco put Mick away. Meanwhile, in an attempt to injure Paco for Mick, Horowitz plants fertilizer into a radio that he has placed in Paco and Viking's cell. When the charge explodes prematurely and only injures Viking, Horowitz is condemned to solitary confinement, a fate he fears more than any other.\n\nPaco's transfer is arranged, so he plans his showdown with Mick for the night before. While Herrera was on night patrol, Paco fakes a ruptured appendix so Herrera comes to his aid. Herrera is assaulted, then caged in the office. The door into the cells is then barricaded, and the entire dormitory is aroused by the brawl. Eventually, Mick comes out on top, and the film ends with him very nearly killing Paco while being encouraged by the others to do it. However, resisting at the last second, he doesn't do it. He then drags a beaten Paco in front of the caged Ramon and other detention officers and heads back to his cell, crying in remorse.\n\nThe idea from the film came from producer Richard Solo who told writer Richard Di Lello he was looking for \"a Jimmy Cagney story set in a modern day reform school.\" Di Lello produced a ten-page treatment which Solo liked. He gave the approval to do a screenplay. Di Lello spent about a year writing the screenplay which he says later mostly came from his imagination, with minimal research; he later did research and found it corresponded with what he had written. \"My imagination turned out to be far more accurate than I ever anticipated,\" he said.\n\nSolo hired Rick Rosenthal to direct. Rosenthal later said when he first read the script, \"I got to page 90, when there'd been a little kid killed, and I said to myself, 'This is reality, but I can't do this, there's just no redeeming value in the whole thing.'... I got to the end. I accepted. Some script changes were made - I think the script was humanized. It's still a hard film, a tough film, but with soul underneath, and I think with social comment that doesn't hit you on the head.\" \n\nThe script was violent but the filmmakers felt this was necessary to tell the story accurately. \"I'm a commercial filmmaker first and foremost,\" said Solo. \"This movie is about young people and the youth audience is the primary one. I simply wanted \"Bad Boys\" to have a tremendous reality. How do you tell this story without violence? If you don't, you're saying violence doesn't exist.\"\n\nFinance was obtained from EMI Films.\n\nRick Rosenthal says Matt Dillon wanted to play the lead role, but the director was reluctant. He cast Sean Penn on the basis of a reading. \"Although I'm crazy about Matt Dillon as an actor, I thought he'd already done the role in My Bodyguard,\" said Rosenthal. \"I was also afraid that the audience might be conscious of a new movie star, where with Penn they'd only be conscious of Mick.\" The director said Penn is \"a very good actor, obsessively so. He went into character for the whole shoot and stayed there, had a real wolf's head tattooed on his arm, checked into hotels as Mick, the whole thing.\"\n\nIt was Ally Sheedy's first role in a feature. \"Rick really took a chance on me, he really did,\" she said.\n\nThe film unit spent six days filming in St Charles, IL, a suburb west of Chicago. They employed about 40 residents as extras.\n\nUniversal Studios originally released \"Bad Boys\" in 1983, and Thorn/EMI released it on its videocassettes in 1984, but in 1999 Artisan Entertainment took the rights and released the DVD. In 2001, Anchor Bay Entertainment took its DVD rights and re-released it, and in 2007 Facets Multimedia Distribution re-released it on its DVDs. \"Bad Boys\" was released on Blu-ray by Lionsgate Home Entertainment for the first time on February 1, 2011, presented \"complete and uncut.\" It is also available for online streaming video rentals and digital download files purchases through Amazon Video and Apple iTunes Store.\n\n\"Bad Boys\" garnered generally positive reviews; review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes currently holds an 89% \"Fresh\" rating based on 19 reviews. David Denby of \"The New Yorker\" magazine argued, \"\"Bad Boys\" is never less than tense and exciting, but it's coarse and grisly, an essentially demagogic piece of work\".\n\nIn his original review, Roger Ebert praised the direction and cinematography in particular and wrote, \"The direction, by Richard Rosenthal, is sure-footed, confident and fluid; we are in the hands of a fine director\". In her review for \"The New York Times\", Janet Maslin wrote, \"Sean Penn's performance is the chief thing that separates \"Bad Boys\" from mere exploitation\". Perry Seibert of All Media Guide said \"Bad Boys proves that great performances can overcome routine story lines.\"\n\nRosenthal later said \"I think I turned down around 20 or 22 films after 'Bad Boys.' The phone rang all the time. The funny thing is, at the time I didn't know I was hot. But after 'American Dreamer,' I knew the difference.\"\n\nThe soundtrack of the film comprised some late, eccentric funk tracks, as well as Billy Squier and Iron Maiden.\n\nThe name of the Croatian ultras group Bad Blue Boys (who support NK Dinamo Zagreb) is said to have been inspired by \"Bad Boys\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1871104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871104", "title": "Sticky bit", "text": "Sticky bit\n\nIn computing, the sticky bit is a user ownership access right flag that can be assigned to files and directories on Unix-like systems.\n\nWhen a directory's sticky bit is set, the filesystem treats the files in such directories in a special way so only the file's owner, the directory's owner, or root user can rename or delete the file. Without the sticky bit set, any user with write and execute permissions for the directory can rename or delete contained files, regardless of the file's owner. Typically this is set on the codice_1 directory to prevent ordinary users from deleting or moving other users' files.\n\nThe modern function of the sticky bit was introduced in 4.3BSD in 1986, and is found in most modern Unix-like systems.\n\nThe sticky bit was introduced in the Fifth Edition of Unix (in 1974) for use with pure executable files. When set, it instructed the operating system to retain the text segment of the program in swap space after the process exited. This speeds up subsequent executions by allowing the kernel to make a single operation of moving the program from swap to real memory. Thus, frequently-used programs like editors would load noticeably faster. One notable problem with \"stickied\" programs was replacing the executable (for instance, during patching); to do so required removing the sticky bit from the executable, executing the program and exiting to flush the cache, replacing the binary executable, and then restoring the sticky bit.\n\nCurrently, this behavior is only operative in HP-UX and UnixWare. Solaris appears to have abandoned this in 2005. The 4.4-Lite release of BSD retained the old sticky bit behavior, but it has been subsequently dropped from OpenBSD (as of release 3.7) and FreeBSD (as of release 2.2.1). No version of Linux has ever supported this traditional behavior; Linux performs caching of executable files in the same way as all files, so re-executing the program to flush the cache is not necessary.\n\nThe most common use of the sticky bit is on directories residing within filesystems for Unix-like operating systems. When a directory's sticky bit is set, the filesystem treats the files in such directories in a special way so only the file's owner, the directory's owner, or root can rename or delete the file. Without the sticky bit set, any user with write and execute permissions for the directory can rename or delete contained files, regardless of the file's owner. Typically, this is set on the codice_1 directory to prevent ordinary users from deleting or moving other users' files. This feature was introduced in 4.3BSD in 1986, and today it is found in most modern Unix-like systems.\n\nIn addition, Solaris (as of Solaris 2.5) defines special behavior when the sticky bit is set on non-executable \"files\": those files, when accessed, will not be cached by the kernel. This is usually set on swap files to prevent access on the file from flushing more important data from the system cache. It is also used occasionally for benchmarking tests.\n\nThe sticky bit is also set by the automounter to indicate that a file has not been mounted yet. This allows programs like \"ls\" to ignore unmounted remote files.\n\nThe sticky bit can be set using the chmod command and can be set using its octal mode 1000 or by its symbol t (s is already used by the setuid bit). For example, to add the bit on the directory codice_3, one would type chmod +t /usr/local/tmp. Or, to make sure that directory has standard codice_4 permissions, one could also type chmod 1777 /usr/local/tmp.\n\nTo clear it, use chmod -t /usr/local/tmp or chmod 0777 /usr/local/tmp (the latter will also reset the codice_4 directory to standard permissions).\n\nIn Unix symbolic file system permission notation, the sticky bit is represented by the letter t in the final character-place, replacing what would otherwise be x. For instance, on Solaris 8, the codice_1 directory, which by default has the sticky-bit set, shows up as:\n$ ls -ld /tmp\ndrwxrwxrwt 4 root sys 485 Nov 10 06:01 /tmp\nIf the sticky-bit is set on a file or directory without the execution bit set for the \"others\" category (non-user-owner and non-group-owner), it is indicated with a capital T (replacing what would otherwise be -):\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root anygroup 0 Nov 10 12:57 test\n-rw-r--r-T 1 root anygroup 0 Nov 10 12:57 test\n\n"}
{"id": "1871119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871119", "title": "Rainbow 100", "text": "Rainbow 100\n\nThe Rainbow 100 was a microcomputer introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1982. This desktop unit had a monitor similar to the VT220 in a dual-CPU box with both Zilog Z80 and Intel 8088 CPUs.\nThe Rainbow 100 was a triple-use machine: VT100 mode (industry standard terminal for interacting with DEC's own VAX), 8-bit CP/M mode (using the Z80), and 16-bit CP/M-86 or MS-DOS mode using the 8088.\n\nThe Rainbow came in three models, the 100A, 100B and 100+. The \"A\" model was the first released, followed later by the \"B\" model. The most noticeable differences between the two models were the firmware and slight hardware changes. The systems were referred to with model numbers \"PC-100A\" and \"PC-100B\" respectively; later were also designated \"PC-100B2\".\n\nThe \"A\" model was the first produced by Digital. The distinguishing characteristic of the \"A\" model from an end-user perspective was that the earlier firmware did not support booting from a hard disk. Other distinguishing hardware features included the three 2764 ROM chips holding the system firmware and the case fan/power supply combinations. Versions of the 100A shipped outside the USA included a user-changeable ROM chip in a special casing. The user changed the built-in ROM for this one to support their keyboard layout and language of the boot screen.\n\nThe \"B\" model followed the \"A\" model, and introduced a number of changes. The \"B\" model featured the ability to boot from a hard disk (referred to as the Winchester drive) via the boot menu due to updated firmware. The hardware changes included bigger firmware stored on two () and an improved case fan/power supply. The firmware allowed selection of the boot screen language and keyboard layout, eliminating the need to switch ROM. The \"B\" model also allowed remapping of hardware interrupts to be more compatible with MS-DOS.\n\nThe \"100+\" model was actually a marketing designation signifying that the system shipped with a hard drive installed; the \"100+\" and \"B\" models were identical in all other respects. When a hard-disk option was installed on the Rainbow, the kit included the \"100+\" emblem for the computer's case.\n\nThe Rainbow contained two separate data buses controlled by the Zilog Z80 and the Intel 8088 respectively. The buses exchanged information via a shared memory.\n\nWhen not executing 8-bit code, the was used for floppy disk access. The 8088 bus was used for control of all other subsystems, including graphics, hard disk access, and communications. While it may have been theoretically possible to load Z80 binary code into the Rainbow to execute alongside 8088 code, this procedure has never been demonstrated.\n\nThe 8088 could be upgraded to the faster NEC V20 chip. This gave about 10-15% speed improvement, but required a two-byte change to the system's ROMs to fix two timing loops.\n\nThe 100A model shipped with memory on the motherboard, while the 100B had 128 KB memory on the motherboard. Daughterboards were available from Digital Equipment Corporation that could increase system memory with up to an additional for a total .\n\nThe floppy disk drives, known as the RX50, accepted proprietary single-sided, quad-density 5¼-inch diskettes. Initial versions of the operating systems on the Rainbow did not allow for low-level formatting, requiring users to purchase RX50 media from Digital Equipment Corporation. The high cost of media ($5 per disk) led to accusations of vendor \"lock-in\" against Digital. However, later versions of MS-DOS and CP/M allowed formatting of diskettes.\n\nOf note was the single motor used to drive both disk drives via a common spindle, which were arranged one on top of the other. That meant that one disk went underneath the first but inserted upside-down. This earned the diskette drive the nickname \"toaster\". The unusual orientation confused many first-time users, who would complain that the machine would not read the disk.\n\nDigital Equipment Corporation produced a Winchester disk controller for the Rainbow capable of controlling hard disks compatible with the ST-506 interface. The controller, however, was limited to a single drive with up to and including and , limiting storage to a maximum of .\n\nThird-party hard-disk controllers were also available, including a dual winchester support from CHS\n\nThe base Rainbow system was capable of displaying text in 80×24- or 132×24-character format in monochrome only. The system could apply attributes to text including bolding, double-width, and double-height-double-width.\n\nThe graphics option was a user-installable module that added graphics and color display capabilities to the Rainbow system. The Graphic module was based on a NEC 7220 graphic display controller (GDC) and an 8×64 KB DRAM video memory.\n\nDue to the design of the graphics system, the Rainbow was capable of controlling two monitors simultaneously, one displaying graphics and another displaying text.\n\nThe base Rainbow system generates a TTL composite-video signal in monochrome mode. With the inclusion of the graphics option, the Rainbow could also output sync-on-green RGB video signals at TTL levels. The Rainbow was most often coupled with the 12-inch VR201 monochrome monitor or the 13-inch VR241 color monitor, both produced by Digital Equipment Corporation.\n\nThe Rainbow 100 and the other two microcomputers which DEC announced at the same time (DECmate II and Pro-350) had two quirks that annoyed conservative users. The LK201 keyboard used a new layout that made some Teletype Model 33 and VT100 users unhappy. However, the VT220 style of this keyboard can clearly be seen in the layout of the enhanced 101-key keyboard adopted by IBM in 1985.\n\nThird-party upgrades were also available, including an 80286 (286) processor upgrade (Turbow-286), a 3.5-inch disk adapter kit (IDrive), and a battery-backed clock chip (ClikClok), all from Suitable Solutions.\n\nIn 1984, the first computer support for Native American languages began with the Rainbow 100. Rock Point Community School on the Navajo reservation in Arizona commissioned a ROM chip for the Navajo language, enabling the school to create bilingual computer programs.\n\nUnivation produced a number of products for the Rainbow as well. They offered add-in memory cards, hard disk controllers and LAN cards.\n\nHere's the various options you could get for the Rainbow that were hardware. Country kits not yet listed.\n\nData compiled from a number of sources including \nThe Rainbow runs the CP/M 86/80 operating system, which detects whether software is written for 8-bit CP/M and 16-bit CP/M-86 and runs it on the appropriate processor. DEC later released MS-DOS, but little DOS software was released on Rainbow media, and there were subtle differences between Rainbow's MS-DOS implementation and MS-DOS (or PC DOS) running on true IBM PC compatibles. Towards the end of its life, Rainbow users were able to run some IBM PC-compatible MS-DOS software using an emulation application called \"Code Blue\", though it only emulated the IBM PC's BIOS, and not the hardware, so programs that accessed the video cards directly would not work.\n\nMS-DOS compatibility was added late in the design, so hardware interrupts and MS-DOS software interrupts overlapped. One DEC documentation pack for developers included a listing of Microsoft assembly code to handle this. The theory was that hardware interrupts would interrupt again but software interrupts would only happen once. The Rainbow 100B fixed this overlap in hardware by changes to the board design that allowed the OS to move the hardware interrupts. This means that the MS-DOS 3.10b version for the Rainbow can only run on the Rainbow 100B.\n\nDEC itself ported Microsoft Windows 1.0 to the Rainbow. There was also a third-party upgrade that included a 286 processor board and a modified version of Windows 3.0.\n\nSoftware bundled with Dec Rainbow floor model included:\n\nThese documents come in booklets contained inside two hard case boxes, with the DEC logo.\n\nThe Rainbow was MS-DOS compatible, but not completely software- or hardware-compatible with the IBM PC. At the time this seemed reasonable, with the expectation being that the interface that programs would target would be MS-DOS, not the underlying hardware. However, many significant commercial software products were written directly to the hardware, for a variety of reasons including performance. Very soon the market expectation was that all MS-DOS computers would be fully IBM PC compatible. While \"Code Blue\" did a good job at emulating the IBM BIOS, its inability to trap references to the video and other hardware limited what would run on the Rainbow. The FOSSIL TSR allowed several terminal programs and editors to run on the IBM-PC, Rainbow and other early 8088/8086 computers, but its limited adoption limited its usefulness. Various other hacks allowed popular programs like Turbo Pascal, Turbo C to run, while patches circulated for a while, but new releases made this difficult to keep up with and over time these hacks dried up (the online archives have very little new after 1991 or 1992, although some of that may be due to the RABIT TSR which solved the problem generically for all Borland products).\n\nThe DEC Rainbow 100 MS-DOS did support FAT formatted floppies. They were FAT12 format on 80-track, single-sided, quad-density 5.25\" drives. The first two tracks were reserved for the boot loader, but didn't contain an MBR nor a BPB (MS-DOS used a static in-memory BPB instead). The boot sector (track 0, side 0, sector 1) was Z80 code beginning with DI 0xF3. The 8088 bootstrap was loaded by the Z80. Track 1, side 0, sector 2 starts with the Media/FAT ID byte 0xFA. Unformatted disks use 0xE5 instead. The file system starts on track 2, side 0, sector 1. There are 2 copies of the FAT and 96 entries in the root directory. In addition, there is a physical to logical track mapping to effect a 2:1 sector interleaving. The disks were formatted with the physical sectors in order numbered 1 to 10 on each track after the reserved tracks, but the logical sectors from 1 to 10 were stored in physical sectors 1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 9, 5, 10. This makes is hard to create Rainbow disk images since all existing tools assume there will be an MBR with a BPB, and required various hacks to make up for the lack of on-disk BPB.\n\nThe DEC Rainbow 100 had no general expansion bus. Instead, it had a number of expansion slots that could be used for a single purpose only: extra memory, graphics, rx-50 floppy controller. One slot was originally designed for a DMA enabled serial card, but hard disk controllers were used there instead because DEC bet wrong on which was more important. Univation produced an Ethernet card that could boot the Rainbow over the network for that slot, but most users preferred to have a hard drive instead. While the software incompatibilities were bad, the lack of expansion hardware flexibility was worse, and the inability to use ISA cards, despite their flaws at the time, played a significant role in the Rainbow fading from the scene more quickly than the original IBM-PC.\n\nThe Multi Emulator Super System can run the Rainbow-specific Windows 1.0.\n\nThe Rainbow 100 plays a small but important role in the creation of the FidoNet system. A computer club in St. Louis was in the process of setting up a BBS system using CBBS on CP/M when they learned that DEC would be giving the club a Rainbow 100 for free. The group planned on starting the BBS on this machine as soon as it arrived; but, when it did, they found that the Z80 did not have access to the serial ports. Casting about for a new BBS platform that ran on DOS, they learned of FidoBBS and arranged to have its developer port the serial drivers to the Rainbow platform. This ran up considerable phone bills sending emails and file transfers between St. Louis and the developer in San Francisco, and the developer produced FidoNet as a method of automating exchanges late at night when phone rates were lower.\n\nPiers Anthony wrote many of his books from the '80s on his DEC Rainbow.\n\nThe DEC Rainbow can be seen in the films \"Ghostbusters\", \"Beverly Hills Cop\", and \"Firestarter\".\n\nMichael Paré watches a TV commercial for \"The Rainbow\" in The Philadelphia Experiment.\n\n"}

Since the minority charge carriers in the n-region and p-region are produced by thermally generated electron-hole pairs, these minority charge carriers are extremely temperature dependent and independent of the applied bias voltage. The applied bias voltage acts as a forward bias voltage for these minority charge carriers and a current of small magnitude flows in the external circuit in the direction opposite to that of the conventional current due to the moment of majority charge carriers.\n\nNote that the saturation current is \"not\" a constant for a given device; it varies with temperature; this variance is the dominant term in the temperature coefficient for a diode.

It was launched in 2001 as the successor to the Perodua Kancil. The Kelisa was sold alongside the older Kancil, and both were eventually replaced by the Perodua Viva in 2007.\n\nThe Kelisa was, in all its releases, based on a fifth-generation Daihatsu Mira (L700), and is named after the arowana fish native to Malaysia (\"ikan kelisa\").\n\nAs Perodua has sold its vehicles in the United Kingdom since 1997, the Kelisa was introduced into the country in 2002 as a replacement to the Nippa, a rebadged Kancil. Like its predecessor, the Kelisa was the cheapest new car on sale in the United Kingdom, starting at under £5,000.\n\nIn 2002, the Kelisa Limited Edition was launched distinguable by a two-tone paintwork, leather seats and leather wrapped steering wheel.\n\nThe Perodua Kelisa launched with three variants: EX, GX and EZ. When the facelift launched in 2003, the models remained the same: EX, GX and EZ. A limited edition Kelisa, based on the original variant, prominently sports two toned colored paintwork and minor interior modifications.\n\nOn 21 October 2003, Perodua launched the facelift to the Perodua Kelisa. differed from the pre-facelift model with a new front honeycomb grille, a new lower front bumper with amber front turn signal lights, a new lower rear bumper with reflector, a newside protector moulding, a new rear wiper, a center position roof antenna, new meter panel, new design sports rims for the EX model and new design wheel caps for the GX model. Pre-facelift models used 13\" wheels while the facelift model used 14\" wheels.\n\nIt was available in five colors: Kristal White, Sparkling Silver, Millenia Gold and Gemilang Blue. Throughout Spring 2004, Perodua replaced the EX variant with the 850 EX variant and rebranded the GX to 1000 GX and EX to 1000 EX.Other changes different gear ratios for the manual transmissions and overall dimensions/size.\n\nThe Limited Edition returned in 2004.\n\nBetween August and November 2004, Perodua launched the Kelisa SE (Special Edition). It was available with both manual (GXS) and automatic (EZS) transmissions. These special edition Kelisa's featured clear lens for the front and side fender mounted turn signals, front seats with fixed headrest, painted center cluster, leather wrapped steering wheel and a bodykit consisting of a rear spoiler, side, front and rear skirts.\n\nIn 2006, Perodua launched the Kelisa Imago. It was available with both manual (GXQ) and automatic (EZQ) transmissions. The changes compared to the other Kelisa variants included a silver painted center cluster (including astray), leather seats with \"imago\" embroidery, leather-wrapped steering wheel, clear side and front turn signals, sporty spoiler, chrome door handles & door lock and a modern Metallic Pearl Jade finish — a light double metallic color.\n\nThe SE and Imago editions used the same alloy wheel designs as the regular EZ variant and do note that non-SE and Imago Kelisa's had yellow lenses for the front and side fender-mounted turn signals.\n\nIn February 2007, selected Kelisa models also came with built in Bluetooth technology.\n\nThroughout the Kelisa's production run, various models were known under various other model names. However, these other names were mainly only used in marketing (price lists, brochures, stickers on the boot and more) as the vehicles actually registration paper would contain the actual model name.\n\nComparing the GX and EZ variants (regardless of pre-facelift or facelift), the EZ variant had in addition to the GX variant an air ionizer, electrically adjustable side mirrors and some form of as well as some form of hands free technology for phones coupled with a phone holder.\n\nWhile the seat fabric was shared between pre-facelift GX and EZ variants, post-facelift GX and EZ variants each had unique fabric upholstery with unique fabric patterns.\n\nIn the second series of \"Top Gear\", James May drove the Kelisa and was generally impressed with the car, even likening it to the original Mini. However, in Jeremy Clarkson's 2005 DVD \"Heaven and Hell\", Clarkson bought a Perodua Kelisa EX and destroyed it by blowing it up immediately after purchasing it, in an effort to highlight aesthetic frustrations with the design.\n\nIn April 2007, Clarkson described it as the worst in the world: \"Its name was like a disease and suggested it was built in jungles by people who wear leaves for shoes.\" His comments drew criticism from the Malaysian Government, a representative of which countered by stating that no complaints had been received from any customers in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

Bodelschwinghsche Anstalten Bethel\") is a diaconal (i.e. Protestant charitable) psychiatric hospital in Bethel, formerly a town, today a neighbourhood of Bielefeld, Germany.\n\nThe healthcare foundation was established in 1867 as \"Evangelische Heil- und Pflegeanstalt für Epileptische\" (Protestant institute of healing and care for epileptics) in Gadderbaum, today a locality of Bielefeld. In 1872 Pastor Friedrich von Bodelschwingh, Senior, a proponent of the inner mission within the then Evangelical State Church in Prussia became its director. He massively strengthened and extended the institution, with more premises also for the poor and at other locations, and renamed it after Bethel in 1874. The name Bethel was also started being used for the neighbourhood, which developed outside the hospital. Later Bodelschwingh's name was compounded to the institution's name. In 1910 Bodelschwingh, Senior, died and the leadership passed on to his son Friedrich von Bodelschwingh, Junior, who led the institution until his death in 1946.\n\nThe institution is notable for its resistance against the Nazi Germany era. In August 1933, some six months after Hitler had become Reich Chancellor, Pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior, met with Dietrich Bonhoeffer and a few others to draft a new confession of faith, clarifying the grounds for resisting the Nazification of Germany. The resulting document, called the Bethel Declaration (Betheler Bekenntnis), was an early form of resistance to Hitler, a rejection of Christian anti-Judaism and racist anti-Semitism, though in practical terms it did nothing to impede the Nazis. During the course of the T-4 Euthanasia Program, which ran in 1940 and 1941 and was aimed at exterminating physically and mentally disabled people, the staff at the institution were mainly in opposition to that crime of the National Socialist party. In 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered the gassing of all mental patients. The director of the hospital, pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior, resisted.\n\n"}

{"id": "1871162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871162", "title": "Spin–orbit interaction", "text": "Spin–orbit interaction\n\nIn quantum physics, the spin–orbit interaction (also called spin–orbit effect or spin–orbit coupling) is a relativistic interaction of a particle's spin with its motion inside a potential. A key example of this phenomenon is the spin–orbit interaction leading to shifts in an electron's atomic energy levels, due to electromagnetic interaction between the electron's magnetic dipole, its orbital motion, and the electrostatic field of the positively charged nucleus. This phenomenon is detectable as a splitting of spectral lines, which can be thought of as a Zeeman effect product of two relativistic effects: the apparent magnetic field seen from the electron perspective and the magnetic moment of the electron associated with its intrinsic spin. A similar effect, due to the relationship between angular momentum and the strong nuclear force, occurs for protons and neutrons moving inside the nucleus, leading to a shift in their energy levels in the nucleus shell model. In the field of spintronics, spin–orbit effects for electrons in semiconductors and other materials are explored for technological applications. The spin–orbit interaction is one cause of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the spin Hall effect.\n\nFor atoms, energy level split produced by the spin-orbit interaction is usually of the same order in size to the relativistic corrections to the kinetic energy and the zitterbewegung effect. The addition of these three corrections is known as the fine structure. The interaction between the magnetic field created by the electron and the magnetic moment of the nucleus is a slighter correction to the energy levels known as the hyperfine structure.\n\nThis section presents a relatively simple and quantitative description of the spin–orbit interaction for an electron bound to a hydrogen-like atom, up to first order in perturbation theory, using some semiclassical electrodynamics and non-relativistic quantum mechanics. This gives results that agree reasonably well with observations. \n\nA rigorous calculation of the same result would use relativistic quantum mechanics, using Dirac equation, and would include many-body interactions. Achieving an even more precise result would involve calculating small corrections from quantum electrodynamics.\n\nThe energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by\n\nwhere μ is the magnetic moment of the particle, and B is the magnetic field it experiences.\n\nWe shall deal with the magnetic field first. Although in the rest frame of the nucleus, there is no magnetic field acting on the electron, there \"is\" one in the rest frame of the electron (see classical electromagnetism and special relativity). Ignoring for now that this frame is not inertial, in SI units we end up with the equation\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the electron, and E is the electric field it travels through. Here, in the non-relativistic limit, we assume that the Lorentz factor formula_3. Now we know that E is radial, so we can rewrite formula_4.\nAlso we know that the momentum of the electron formula_5. Substituting this in and changing the order of the cross product gives\n\nNext, we express the electric field as the gradient of the electric potential formula_7. Here we make the central field approximation, that is, that the electrostatic potential is spherically symmetric, so is only a function of radius. This approximation is exact for hydrogen and hydrogen-like systems. Now we can say that\n\nwhere formula_9 is the potential energy of the electron in the central field, and \"e\" is the elementary charge. Now we remember from classical mechanics that the angular momentum of a particle formula_10. Putting it all together, we get\n\nIt is important to note at this point that B is a positive number multiplied by L, meaning that the magnetic field is parallel to the orbital angular momentum of the particle, which is itself perpendicular to the particle's velocity.\n\nThe spin magnetic moment of the electron is\n\nwhere formula_13 is the spin angular-momentum vector, formula_14 is the Bohr magneton, and formula_15 is the electron-spin g-factor. Here formula_16 is a negative constant multiplied by the spin, so the spin magnetic moment is antiparallel to the spin angular momentum.\n\nThe spin–orbit potential consists of two parts. The Larmor part is connected to the interaction of the spin magnetic moment of the electron with the magnetic field of the nucleus in the co-moving frame of the electron. The second contribution is related to Thomas precession.\n\nThe Larmor interaction energy is\n\nSubstituting in this equation expressions for the spin magnetic moment and the magnetic field, one gets\n\nNow we have to take into account Thomas precession correction for the electron's curved trajectory.\n\nIn 1926 Llewellyn Thomas relativistically recomputed the doublet separation in the fine structure of the atom. Thomas precession rate formula_19 is related to the angular frequency of the orbital motion formula_20 of a spinning particle as follows:\n\nwhere formula_22 is the Lorentz factor of the moving particle. The Hamiltonian producing the spin \nprecession formula_19 is given by\n\nTo the first order in formula_25, we obtain\n\nThe total spin–orbit potential in an external electrostatic potential takes the form \nThe net effect of Thomas precession is the reduction of the Larmor interaction energy by factor 1/2, which came to be known as the \"Thomas half\".\n\nThanks to all the above approximations, we can now evaluate the detailed energy shift in this model. Note that \"L\" and \"S\" are no longer conserved quantities. In particular, we wish to find a new basis that diagonalizes both \"H\" (the non-perturbed Hamiltonian) and Δ\"H\". To find out what basis this is, we first define the total angular momentum operator\n\nTaking the dot product of this with itself, we get\n\n(since L and S commute), and therefore\n\nIt can be shown that the five operators \"H\", \"J, L, S\", and \"J\" all commute with each other and with Δ\"H\". Therefore, the basis we were looking for is the simultaneous eigenbasis of these five operators (i.e., the basis where all five are diagonal). Elements of this basis have the five quantum numbers: \"formula_31\" (the \"principal quantum number\"), formula_32 (the \"total angular momentum quantum number\"), \"formula_33\" (the \"orbital angular momentum quantum number\"), \"formula_34\" (the \"spin quantum number\"), and formula_35 (the \"\"z\" component of total angular momentum\").\n\nTo evaluate the energies, we note that\n\nfor hydrogenic wavefunctions (here formula_37 is the Bohr radius divided by the nuclear charge \"Z\"); and\n\nWe can now say that\n\nwhere\n\nFor the exact relativistic result, see the solutions to the Dirac equation for a hydrogen-like atom.\n\nA crystalline solid (semiconductor, metal etc.) is characterized by its band structure. While on the overall scale (including the core levels) the spin–orbit interaction is still a small perturbation, it may play a relatively more important role if we zoom in to bands close to the Fermi level (formula_41). The atomic formula_42 (spin–orbit) interaction, for example, splits bands that would be otherwise degenerate, and the particular form of this spin–orbit splitting (typically of the order of few to few hundred millielectronvolts) depends on the particular system. The bands of interest can be then described by various effective models, usually based on some perturbative approach. An example of how the atomic spin–orbit interaction influences the band structure of a crystal is explained in the article about Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions.\n\nIn crystalline solid contained paramagnetic ions, e.g. ions with unclosed d or f atomic subshell, localized electronic states exist. In this case, atomic-like electronic levels structure is shaped by intrinsic magnetic spin–orbit interactions and interactions with crystalline electric fields. Such structure is named the fine electronic structure. For rare-earth ions the spin–orbit interactions are much stronger than the crystal electric field (CEF) interactions. The strong spin–orbit coupling makes \"J\" a relatively good quantum number, because the first excited multiplet is at least ~130 meV (1500 K) above the primary multiplet. The result is that filling it at room temperature (300 K) is negligibly small. In this case, a (2\"J\" + 1)-fold degenerated primary multiplet split by an external CEF can be treated as the basic contribution to the analysis of such systems' properties. In the case of approximate calculations for basis formula_43, to determine which is the primary multiplet, the Hund principles, known from atomic physics, are applied:\n\n\nThe \"S\", \"L\" and \"J\" of the ground multiplet are determined by Hund's rules. The ground multiplet is 2\"J\" + 1 degenerated – its degeneracy is removed by CEF interactions and magnetic interactions. CEF interactions and magnetic interactions resemble, somehow, Stark and Zeeman effect known from atomic physics. The energies and eigenfunctions of the discrete fine electronic structure are obtained by diagonalization of the (2\"J\" + 1)-dimensional matrix. The fine electronic structure can be directly detected by many different spectroscopic methods, including the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments. The case of strong cubic CEF (for 3\"d\" transition-metal ions) interactions form group of levels (e.g. \"T\", \"A\"), which are partially split by spin–orbit interactions and (if occur) lower-symmetry CEF interactions. The energies and eigenfunctions of the discrete fine electronic structure (for the lowest term) are obtained by diagonalization of the (\"2L + 1)(2S + 1)\"-dimensional matrix. At zero temperature (\"T\" = 0 K) only the lowest state is occupied. The magnetic moment at \"T\" = 0 K is equal to the moment of the ground state. It allows the evaluation of the total, spin and orbital moments. The eigenstates and corresponding eigenfunctions formula_44 can be found from direct diagonalization of Hamiltonian matrix containing crystal field and spin–orbit interactions. Taking into consideration the thermal population of states, the thermal evolution of the single-ion properties of the compound is established. This technique is based on the equivalent operator theory defined as the CEF widened by thermodynamic and analytical calculations defined as the supplement of the CEF theory by including thermodynamic and analytical calculations.\n\nHole bands of a bulk (3D) zinc-blende semiconductor will be split by formula_45 into heavy and light holes (which form a formula_46 quadruplet in the formula_47-point of the Brillouin zone) and a split-off band (formula_48 doublet). Including two conduction bands (formula_49 doublet in the formula_47-point), the system is described by the effective eight-band model of Kohn and Luttinger. If only top of the valence band is of interest (for example when formula_51, Fermi level measured from the top of the valence band), the proper four-band effective model is\n\nwhere formula_53 are the Luttinger parameters (analogous to the single effective mass of a one-band model of electrons) and formula_54 are angular momentum 3/2 matrices (formula_55 is the free electron mass). In combination with magnetization, this type of spin–orbit interaction will distort the electronic bands depending on the magnetization direction, thereby causing magnetocrystalline anisotropy (a special type of magnetic anisotropy).\nIf the semiconductor moreover lacks the inversion symmetry, the hole bands will exhibit cubic Dresselhaus splitting. Within the four bands (light and heavy holes), the dominant term is\n\nwhere the material parameter formula_57 for GaAs (see pp. 72 in Winkler's book, according to more recent data the Dresselhaus constant in GaAs is 9 eVÅ; the total Hamiltonian will be formula_58). Two-dimensional electron gas in an asymmetric quantum well (or heterostructure) will feel the Rashba interaction. The appropriate two-band effective Hamiltonian is\n\nwhere formula_60 is the 2 × 2 identity matrix, formula_61 the Pauli matrices and formula_62 the electron effective mass. The spin–orbit part of the Hamiltonian, formula_63 is parametrized by formula_64, sometimes called the Rashba parameter (its definition somewhat varies), which is related to the structure asymmetry. \n\nAbove expressions for spin–orbit interaction couple spin matrices formula_65 and formula_66 to the quasi-momentum formula_67, and to the vector potential formula_68 of an AC electric field through the Peierls substitution formula_69. They are lower order terms of the Luttinger–Kohn k·p perturbation theory in powers of formula_70. Next terms of this expansion also produce terms that couple spin operators of the electron coordinate formula_71. Indeed, a cross product formula_72 is invariant with respect to time inversion. In cubic crystals, it has a symmetry of a vector and acquires a meaning of a spin–orbit contribution formula_73 to the operator of coordinate. For electrons in semiconductors with a narrow gap formula_74 between the conduction and heavy hole bands, Yafet derived the equation\nwhere formula_76 is a free electron mass, and formula_77 is a formula_77-factor properly renormalized for spin–orbit interaction. This operator couples electron spin formula_79 directly to the electric field formula_80 through the interaction energy formula_81.\n\nElectric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) is the coupling of the electron spin with an oscillating electric field. Similar to the electron spin resonance (ESR) in which electrons can be excited with an electromagnetic wave with the energy given by the Zeeman effect, in EDSR the resonance can be achieved if the frequency is related to the energy band split given by the spin-orbit coupling in solids. While in ESR the coupling is obtained via the magnetic part of the EM wave with the electron magnetic moment, the ESDR is the coupling of the electric part with the spin and motion of the electrons. This mechanism has been proposed for controlling the spin of electrons in quantum dots and other mesoscopic systems.\n\n\n\n"}

In some ways, the PDP-11 microprocessors were technically superior to the Intel-based chips. While the 8088 was restricted to 1MB of memory because of its 20-bit address bus, DEC microprocessors were capable of accessing 4MB with their 22-bit addressing (although direct addressing of memory was limited in both approaches to 64KB segments, limiting the size of individual code and data objects). But other factors would weigh more heavily in the competition, including DEC's corporate culture and business model, which were ill-suited to the rapidly developing consumer market for computers. \"BYTE\" in 1984 reported that Venix on the PC outperformed the same operating system on the DEC Professional and PDP-11/23.\n\nFurther, although the PDP-11 was a very successful minicomputer, it lacked a wide base of affordable small business software. By comparison, many existing CP/M applications (see the Rainbow 100) were easily ported to the similar 8086/8088 chips and MS-DOS operating system. Porting existing PDP-11 software to the PRO was complicated by design decisions that rendered it partially incompatible with its parent product line. Industry critics observed that this incompatibility appeared at least in part deliberate, as DEC belatedly sought to \"protect\" its more-profitable mainstream PDP-11s from price competition with lower-priced PCs.\n\nThe PRO was never widely accepted as an office personal computer, nor as a scientific workstation, where the market was also headed to Intel 8086, or alternately to Motorola 68000-based computers. The failure of DEC to gain a significant foothold in the high-volume PC market would be the beginning of the end of the computer \"hardware\" industry in New England, as nearly all computer companies located there were focused on minicomputers, from DEC to Data General, Wang, Prime, Computervision, and Honeywell.\n\nThe PRO-325 and -350 used the F-11 chipset (as used in LSI-11/23 systems) to create a single-board PDP-11 with up to six expansion slots of a proprietary CTI (Computing Terminal Interconnect) bus using 90-pin ZIF connectors. The PRO family used dual RX50 floppy drives for storage; the PRO-325 had only floppies, and the 350 and 380 also included an internal hard drive. Mainline PDP-11s generally used separate serial terminals as console and display devices; the PRO family used in-built bit-mapped graphics to drive a combined console and display. \n\nAll other I/O devices in the PRO family were also different (in most cases, radically different) from their counterparts on other PDP-11 models. For example, while the internal bus supported direct memory access (DMA), none of the available I/O devices actually used this feature. The interrupt system was implemented using Intel PC chips of the time, which again made it very different from the PDP-11 standard interrupt architecture. For all these reasons, support of the PRO family required extensive modifications to the previously-existing operating system software, and the PRO could not run standard PDP-11 software without modification.\n\nThe default PRO-3xx operating system was DEC's Professional Operating System (P/OS), a modified version of RSX-11M with a menu-driven core user interface. Industry critics complained that this user interface was awkward, slow, and inflexible, offering few advantages over the command-line based MS-DOS user interface that was coming into widespread use.\n\nOther available operating systems included DEC RT-11, VenturCom Venix, and 2.9BSD Unix.\n\nLater, the Professional 380 (PRO-380) was introduced using the much faster J-11 chip set (as used in 11/73 systems). However, due to clocking issues on the motherboard, the J-11 chip ran at 10 MHz instead of 16-18 MHz, thus making the PRO-380 slower than a stock 11/73 system.\n\nThe DEC Professional Series PC-38N was a PRO-380 with a real-time interface (RTI) that was used as the console for the VAX 8500 and 8550. The RTI has two serial line units: one connects to the VAX environmental monitoring module (EMM) and the other is a spare that could be used for data transfer. The RTI also has a programmable peripheral interface (PPI) consisting of three 8-bit ports for transferring data, address, and control signals between the console and the VAX console interface.\n\nLike the PDP-8 and PDP-11 before it, the Professional 350 was cloned in the Soviet Union (in this case, as the Elektronika MS-0585).\n\n"}

Professor Iain Morrison was appointed the third foundation director of the company. The company chose to trade under the business name of Melbourne IT from its earliest days.\n\nContrary to popular mythology, the company was not set up to trade in domain names. The company's charter was to demonstrate the University's strategic leadership in working with industry and government in selected areas of IT. Its first and continuingly profitable business, up until its float on the ASX in December 1999, was its joint venture ASAC (Advanced Services Applications Centre) with Ericsson Australia. ASAC was set up to develop applications with synergies between the Internet and advanced telecommunications, particularly mobile products. ASAC was recognized by Ericsson as one of its Global Design Centres in 1997, and contributed $0.5 million in profit to Melbourne IT in the year before its float. ASAC was incorporated as an independent joint venture in December 2000, but became a casualty of Ericsson's downsizing of its global R&D following the bursting of the Dot-com bubble in July 2000.\nOn 21 June 1996 a front-page article in \"The Australian Financial Review\" by Charles Wright drew attention to the parlous state of commercial domain name registration in Australia, where a large backlog of Australian businesses were waiting for processing of their applications for com.au domain names by the part-time domain name administrator, Robert Elz, senior system administrator in the University of Melbourne's Computer Science Department, who declined to communicate with the media.\n\nRobert Elz had been assigned the role of administrator of the .au top-level domain by Jon Postel since 1989, an arrangement that worked quite satisfactorily through the early 1990s when the Internet was largely of interest only to tertiary educational and research institutions. The AFR article caused Melbourne University to be aware of the possible commercial value of the rights to assign domain names, but also of the damage to the University's reputation if the registration of com.au domain names was not transferred to a competent commercial organization. The Head of the Computer Science Department persuaded Mr Elz to transfer the administration of com.au names to the University's subsidiary Melbourne IT, which he did by way of a non-exclusive licence, to be reviewed after five years. Melbourne IT was awarded a grant of $100,000 by the Government of Victoria in 1996 in return for registering the backlog of over 2,000 com.au applications free to the applicants, and used this money to build its first domain name registration software platform.\n\nFrom October 1996 Melbourne IT began pricing its services by charging for new and renewed com.au names at 10% below the market rate set by Network Solutions for the popular .com names, and was the first domain name registrar worldwide to introduce trademark checking and money-back service assurance guarantees. It also introduced three-tiered pricing for different levels of turnaround time, during the first two years 1997-98 before eligibility decisions were sped up by online access to the Australian trademarks database and to registries of Australian business names and gazetted geographical names. Melbourne IT also moved to align to Robert Elz's rather idiosyncratic eligibility criteria (e.g., ‘no name should in principle be registered if found in an English dictionary’; but exceptions had been made to this before 1996 such as news.com.au and travel.com.au, which annoyed other applicants to the rules for registering business names in Australia).\n\nIn April 1999 Melbourne IT was selected by ICANN to be one of the first five registrars to register .com, .net and .org names in competition with the incumbent Network Solutions. Entry into the international domain name market from July 1999 greatly increased the company's revenues and market value, and caused the University to prepare the company for an Initial Public Offering. On 14 December 1999 Melbourne IT was floated on the ASX, near the height of the dot-com bubble.\n\nIt benefited from a cover story by finance journalist Ivor Rees in a weekend edition of the Australian Financial Review in November 1999, describing it presciently as the ‘Hottest Float of the Year’. Interest in the shares was particularly strong because it was the only Australian tech stock floating that year with a track record of actual profitability. Demands for a prospectus were so high that complaints were aired in the media by members of the public unable to obtain one. The chief beneficiaries of the float were the clients of the underwriters, JB Were and CommSec, some of whom made massive stag profits when the stock peaked at $8.20 on the day of its float, compared with the IPO price of $2.20. In 2000 the Victorian Auditor-General held an investigation into whether the stock was undervalued by the underwriters when listed, but concluded that the float had been carried out properly.\n\nThe University of Melbourne received a gross benefit of $93.5 million through selling 85% of its equity in the float, as well as a pre-float dividend of $1 million, but left the company with $7.5 million as working capital. The stock held up above $8 for four months following the dot-com bubble of April 2000, peaking briefly to $17 in February, but sank to $5.99 after the company released a realistic market outlook on 23 August 2000.\n\nDuring January to August 2000 the founding CEO Peter Gerrand founded subsidiaries in the US and Europe , and participated in the creation of auDA as the national domain name industry self-regulator. On 14 September he announced he would leave the company on 30 September for family reasons; after this announcement the stock sank by a further 10%. He was succeeded by his deputy Adrian Kloeden , and continued as a consultant to the company until after the hosting of ICANN's meeting in Melbourne in March 2001. Adrian Kloeden was succeeded as CEO by Theo Hnarakis in November 2002 .\n\nIn September 2006, Melbourne IT acquired the Australian Internet hosting company, WebCentral Group (ASX:WCG) via a scheme of arrangement and delisted the WebCentral group from the ASX. Founded in 1997, WCG have 2 data centres in Brisbane, one at Wickham Street, Fortitude Valley, and another in Spring Hill at a PIPE Networks facility. Staff from Webcentral's Brisbane office also manage a large colocation area in an Equinix datacenter in Mascot, New South Wales.\n\nDr Bruce Tonkin , who joined Melbourne IT in 1999 as Chief Technology Officer, was elected convenor of ICANN's important GNSO (Generic Names Support Organization) constituency from June 2004 to June 2007, and will serve on the ICANN Boards as the GNSO's elected representative from May 2008.\n\nOn 30 April 2008 Melbourne IT announced it is going to purchase VeriSign's Digital Brand Management Services for US$50m.\n\nOn 23 December 2011 Melbourne IT accidentally leaked the details of more than 28000 customers\n\nOn 30 July 2012 Melbourne IT servers were hacked by Anonymous\n\nMelbourneIT was also a new gTLD consultancy, and the week of the January, 2012, which was the launch of ICANN's new gTLD application period, it announced that it had been working with over 100 applications on behalf of various clients. MelbourneIT also noted that many of their clients are Fortune 500 companies or associated with the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). The latter fact is particularly noteworthy given the fact that ANA had led a high-profile anti-gTLD expansion campaign following the approval of the program, and was successful in achieving multiple hearings in the U.S. congress and other anti-TLD expansion forums and press.\n\nIn February, 2012, one of the first public Brand TLD ventures, StarHub, announced that it had partnered with MelbourneIT's Digital Brand Services to help apply for and manage its proposed .starhub TLD. Later that month, MelbourneIT revealed that they were currently working on 120 new gTLD applications, and that they expected to bring that number to 150 before the application window closed in just over a month. It was also announced that MelbourneIT was working as new gTLD consultants with the governments of the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales, and with ARI Registry Services, to prepare bids for .melbourne, .sydney, and .victoria.[23] The company ended up handling 148 applications, approximately a quarter of which came from Australian clients.\nOn 29 August 2013 Melbourne IT CEO Theo Hnarakis announced that the Syrian Electronic Army had attacked the New York Times Web site by tricking people managing the New York Times DNS domain as a reseller of Melbourne IT to disclose their login credentials in a targeted phishing attack.\n\nOn 27 February 2014 Melbourne IT announced the acquisition of rival NetRegistry Group for $50.4 million.\n\nOn 17 December 2014 Websites and emails were knocked offline by a botched migration. At the time of writing both had been offline for over a month with outages continuing\n\nOn 10 June, 2015 Melbourne IT acquired 50.2% of Outware Mobile for $21.7 million Outware Mobile was founded in 2009 and quickly grew to one of the largest app development companies in Australia. Outware designed and developed some of the most used apps in Australia, including AFL Live, NRL Live and Cricket Live.\n\nOn 25 February 2015, Melbourne IT revealed plans to buy Uber Global for $15.5 million.\n\nOn 16 March 2016, Melbourne IT acquired InfoReady for $15 million\n\nOn 17 February 2017, Melbourne IT acquired the remaining 24.9% of Outware Mobile for $26.9 million\n\nIn May 2017, Melbourne IT acquired WME Group for approximately AU$39 million( US$39 million).\n\nOn 28 May 2018, Melbourne IT Group officially rebranded as Arq Group.\n\n"}

He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War.\n\nBridgeman was the son of John Bridgeman, Bishop of Chester, and his wife Elizabeth Helyar, daughter of Reverend William Helyar. He was educated Queens' College, Cambridge and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1624. In the same year, Bridgeman became a Fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple. He worked as barrister until 1632, becoming Vice-Chamberlain of Chester in 1638. In 1640, he was appointed Attorney of the Court of Wards in 1640, and Solicitor-General to Charles, the Prince of Wales.\n\nIn April 1640, Bridgeman was elected Member of Parliament for Wigan in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Wigan for the Long Parliament in November 1640. He rallied to the royal cause and in 1642 assisted Lord Strange at Chester against the parliamentary forces. As a result, he was disabled from sitting in parliament on 29 August 1642. He was knighted by the King in 1643. From 1644 to 1646, Bridgeman was Custos Rotulorum of Cheshire. In 1645, he was Commissioner at the Treaty of Uxbridge on behalf of the King. He compounded for his delinquency in 1646.\n\nOn 30 May 1660, Bridgeman was made Serjeant-at-Law, and two days later Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. The following week, on 7 June 1660, he was created a Baronet, of Great Lever, in the County of Lancaster. From 1660 to 1668, Bridgeman was Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and from 1667 to 1672 Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, resigning because he refused to apply the Great Seal to the Royal Declaration of Indulgence, which he regarded as too generous to Catholics. In 1668, he was a member of the New England Company. In his final years, Bridgeman appointed metaphysical poet, theologian, and priest Thomas Traherne (c. 1637 – 1674) as his private chaplain at Teddington and supported the publication of his writings. Bridgeman died aged 65 in Teddington, Middlesex and was buried there.\n\nBridgeman was highly regarded in his time for his participation in the trial of the regicides of King Charles I in 1660, and for devising complex legal instruments for the conveyance of estates in land. Among Bridgeman's most enduring inventions was a device for the 22nd Earl of Arundel, which led to the creation in the Duke of Norfolk's Case, 3 Ch. Ca. 1, 22. Eng. Rep. 931 (Ch. 1681), of the Rule Against Perpetuities. Following the Great Fire of London he was one of the judges appointed to resolve disputes about property arising from the fire.\n\nBridgeman married twice, firstly Judith Kynaston, daughter of John Kynaston, on 30 January 1627 or 1628.

It was filmed in Jackson's Point, Ontario and Port Perry, Ontario.\n\nFormer President of the United States Monroe \"Eagle\" Cole retires to his vacation home in the town of Mooseport, Maine to escape from his ex-wife Charlotte. Harold \"Handy\" Harrison is the town's local hardware store owner and plumber. Harrison's job keeps him so busy that he has neglected his relationship with girlfriend Sally Mannis, who is on the verge of dumping him.\n\nFollowing the death of the town mayor, the town council decides to approach former president Cole about running for the office. Cole agrees because, if he is mayor, his Mooseport house can serve as his office and, therefore, can no longer be divided up or sold off in his divorce settlement. As a surprise to Handy, his name has also been entered into the race. When Harrison finds out Cole is running, he decides to withdraw, until he witnesses Cole make a pass at Sally. Handy believes that, by becoming mayor, he can show Sally he is a mature decision maker and win back her heart.\n\nTempers rise following the arrival of Cole's ex-wife and campaign spoiler Charlotte. Cole's team, led by long-time executive secretary Grace Sutherland and presidential aide Will Bullard, bring in strong support in the form of campaign strategist Bert Langdon, who is looking for excitement since Cole's retirement. As the campaigns progress, Cole and Harrison both become obsessed with winning the race at all costs, although Harrison refuses to resort to cheating. Cole realizes that in all his years of campaigning this may be his toughest as he is taking on a genuinely honest everyman.\n\nEventually, on the night before the election, both candidates urge the voters to vote for the other candidate by saying that neither of them will vote for themselves. Harrison keeps his promise, but Cole votes for himself anyway. Upon the revelation that Cole won by one vote, his conscience gets the better of him and he concedes the match to Harrison. However, Harrison lies that he voted for himself as well, and declines office, making Cole end up as mayor. Harrison later reveals to Sally that he conceded the election because Cole needs the mayorship more than he does and that all he really wanted was to propose marriage to her, which he does. As Handy is proposing to Sally, Monroe also proposes to Grace. The film ends with Bert Langdon telling Handy that he ran an excellent campaign and offers to be his campaign manager for Governor of Maine, which Handy shows some interest in when he realizes a governor has certain authority over mayors.\n\n\"Welcome to Mooseport\" opened theatrically on February 20, 2004, in 2,868 venues, earning $6,775,132 and ranking fourth in the domestic box office. The film ended its run twelve weeks later on May 13, 2004, having grossed $14,470,947 domestically and $144,152 overseas, for a worldwide total of $14,615,099. Based on a $30 million budget, the film was a box office bomb.\n\nThe film received generally negative reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 13% score, based on 144 critics, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The site's consensus states: \"A bland comedy that squanders a talented cast.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a 33 out of 100 rating, based on 36 reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". James Berardinelli of \"ReelViews\" gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying that \"\"Welcome to Mooseport\"'s satirical edge is dull and pitted, the screenplay is overlong and uninteresting, the comedy is soft and shapeless, and the actors perform like they're on a sit com. There's not a whole lot to like about \"Welcome to Mooseport\", and, considering how lively real politics can be these days, you're likely to get more entertainment from watching two hours of CSPAN.\" William Arnold of the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" complimented Hackman's \"detailed, delightful, comic performance that never quite disintegrates into caricature\", but wrote that \"the quality of the writing is nowhere near the standard of Hackman's performance, and the movie around him (...) too often substitutes sight gags involving geriatric nudity and fornicating canines for wit.\" In addition, Arnold felt that Ray Romano \"just doesn't have the stuff to bring off a role that requires a Jimmy Stewart or Tom Hanks. He's supposed to be overshadowed by his nemesis, of course, but Hackman chews him up and spits him out so effectively that the movie is glaringly lopsided.\"\n\nHowever, Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" awarded the film three out of four stars, writing: \"Whether the movie works or not depends on the charm of the actors. Hackman could charm the chrome off a trailer hitch. Romano is more of the earnest, aw-shucks, sincere, well-meaning kind of guy whose charm is inner and only peeks out occasionally. They work well together here, and Tierney does a heroic job of playing a character who doesn't know how the story will end, when everybody else, in the cast and in the audience, has an excellent idea.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1871172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871172", "title": "Hereford Mappa Mundi", "text": "Hereford Mappa Mundi\n\nThe Hereford Mappa Mundi is a medieval map of the known world (mappa mundi in Latin), of a form deriving from the T and O pattern, dating from c. 1300. It is displayed at Hereford Cathedral in Hereford, England. It is the largest medieval map still known to exist. A larger mappa mundi, the Ebstorf map, was destroyed by Allied bombing in 1943, though photographs of it survive.\n\nThe Hereford Mappa Mundi hung, with little regard, for many years on a wall of a choir aisle in the cathedral. During the troubled times of the Commonwealth the map had been laid beneath the floor of Bishop Audley's Chantry, where it remained secreted for some time. In 1855 it was cleaned and repaired at the British Museum. During the Second World War, for safety reasons, the mappa mundi and other valuable manuscripts from Hereford Cathedral Library were kept elsewhere and returned to the collection in 1946.\n\nIn 1988, a financial crisis in the Diocese of Hereford caused the Dean and Chapter to propose selling the mappa mundi. After much controversy, large donations from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, Paul Getty and members of the public kept the map in Hereford and allowed the construction of a new library designed by Sir William Whitfield to house the map and the chained libraries of the Cathedral and of All Saints' Church. The new Library Building in the south east corner of the cathedral close opened in 1996. An open-access high-resolution digital image of the map with more than 1,000 place and name annotations is included among the thirteen medieval maps of the world edited in the Virtual Mappa project.\nIn 1991 BR Class 31 loco No.31405 was named 'Mappa Mundi' at a ceremony at the Hereford Rail Day.\n\nDrawn on a single sheet of vellum, it measures 158 cm by 133 cm, some in diameter and is the largest medieval map known still to exist. The writing is in black ink, with additional red and gold, and blue or green for water (with the Red Sea (8) coloured red). It depicts 420 towns, 15 Biblical events, 33 animals and plants, 32 people, and five scenes from classical mythology.\n\nJerusalem is drawn at the centre of the circle; east is on top, showing the Garden of Eden in a circle at the edge of the world (1). Great Britain is drawn at the northwestern border (bottom left, 22 & 23). Curiously, the labels for Africa and Europe are reversed, with Europe scribed in red and gold as \"Africa\", and vice versa.\n\nThe map is based on traditional accounts and earlier maps such as the one of the Beatus of Liébana codex, and is very similar to the Ebstorf map, the Psalter world map, and the \"Sawley\" (erroneously for considerable time called \"Henry of Mainz\") map; it does not correspond to the geographical knowledge of the 14th century. Note, for example, that the Caspian Sea (5) connects to the encircling ocean (upper left). This is in spite of William of Rubruk's having reported it to be landlocked in 1255, i.e. several decades before the map's creation; see also Portolan chart.\n\nThe \"T and O\" shape does not imply that its creators believed in a flat Earth. The spherical shape of the Earth was already known to the ancient Greeks and Romans and the idea was never entirely forgotten even in the Middle Ages, and thus the circular representation may well be considered a conventional attempt at a projection: in spite of the acceptance of a spherical Earth, only the known parts of the Northern Hemisphere were believed to be inhabitable by human beings (see antipodes), so that the circular representation remained adequate. The long river on the far right is the River Nile, too (12), and the T shape is established by the Mediterranean Sea (19-21-25) and the rivers Don (13) and Nile (16).\n\nIt is the earliest known map to depict the mythical island of St Brendan's Isle, which then appeared on many other maps including Martin Behaim's Erdapfel of 1492.\n\nThe map is signed by or attributed to one \"Richard of Haldingham and Lafford\", also known as Richard de Bello, \"prebend of Lafford in Lincoln Cathedral\". However, this attribution isn't completely agreed upon, it being suggested that the exquisite level of detail included in the map could not have been completed by one person. Some people believe that the map was originally created by Richard of Haldingham and Lafford and that at his death it passed to his younger cousin, Richard de Bello. Once it was in de Bello's possession, de Bello and his patron Richard Swindfield worked on the map.\n\nIt was long believed that the mappa mundi was created, not in Hereford, but in Lincoln because the city of Lincoln was drawn in considerable detail and was represented by a cathedral (accurately) located on a hill near a river. Hereford, on the other hand, was represented only by a cathedral, a seeming afterthought drawn by a different hand when compared with other features of the map.

It was first used by Digital's VT220 ANSI/ASCII terminal and was subsequently used by the Rainbow-100, DECmate-II, and Pro-350 microcomputers and many of Digital's computer workstations such as the VAXstation and DECstation families.\n\nThe keyboard layout was new at the time, adding a set of cursor and miscellaneous keys between the main keyboard and the numeric keypad. The cursor keys were arranged in what has now become the standard \"Inverted T\" arrangement seen on essentially all contemporary full-sized computer keyboards. Ergonomic considerations caused the keyboard to be designed with a very low profile; it was very thin, especially when compared to the keyboard used on the VT100. The keyboard connected using a modular connector over which flowed power and asynchronous serial data.\n\nThe keyboard also added a Compose key. This allowed the typing of all of the characters in the terminal's extended character set using two-stroke mnemonics to represent the characters. An umlaut, for example, \"ü\" could be typed by pressing the following sequence:\nAn LED on the keyboard indicated an ongoing compose sequence.\n\nAt the time of its introduction, the differences between the new layout and the traditional Teletype Model 33 and VT100 layouts proved disruptive, but the LK201's key arrangement has become the de facto standard for all full-sized computer keyboards, differing primarily in the fact that the Compose key has been removed, and that the numeric keypad shows two double-height keys instead of one, decreasing the number pad keys from 18 to 17.\n\nFollow-on keyboards from Digital refined the design introduced with the LK201. One notable departure from the basic LK201 design was a Unix-oriented keyboard, the LK421, that omitted the added middle group of cursor and miscellaneous function keys but included a dedicated Escape Key. Many Unix users preferred a narrower, ASCII-oriented keyboard rather than the rather-wide LK201 arrangement and the Escape Key was essential for several popular Unix editors.\n\n"}

An Arminian priest in the Church of England, Whitby was known as strongly anti-Calvinistic and later gave evidence of Unitarian tendencies.\n\nThe son of Thomas Whitby, rector (1631–7) of Rushden, Northamptonshire, then rector of Barrow-on-Humber, Lincolnshire, he was born at Rushden on 24 March 1638. After attending school at Caster, Lincolnshire, he became in 1653 a commoner of Trinity College, Oxford, matriculating on 23 July, when his name is written Whitbie. He was elected scholar on 13 June 1655, graduated with a Bachelor of Arts on 20 April 1657, M.A. on 10 April 1660, and was elected fellow in 1664. In the same year he came out as a writer against Roman Catholic doctrine, attacking Serenus Cressy. He was answered by John Sergeant, to whom he replied in 1666. Seth Ward, bishop of Salisbury, made him his chaplain in 1668, giving him on 22 October the prebend of Yatesbury, and on 7 November the prebend of Husborn-Tarrant and Burbage.\n\nIn 1669 he became perpetual curate of St. Thomas's and rector of St. Edmund's, Salisbury. He next wrote on the evidences (1671). On 11 September 1672 he was installed precentor at Salisbury, and at once accumulated B.D. and D.D. (13 September). He resumed his anti-Catholic polemics in 1674, and continued to publish on this topic at intervals till 1689.\n\nWhitby's reputation suffered by his anonymous publication, late in 1682, of \"The Protestant Reconciler\", a plea for concessions to nonconformists, with a view to their comprehension. A fierce paper war followed, in which Lawrence Womock, David Jenner, and Samuel Thomas took part. In contemporary pamphlets Whitby, nicknamed Whigby, was unfavourably contrasted with Titus Oates; ironical letters of thanks were addressed to him, purporting to come from Anabaptists and others. The University of Oxford in convocation (21 July 1683) condemned the proposition 'that the duty of not offending a weak brother is inconsistent with all human authority of making laws concerning indifferent things,' and ordered Whitby's book to be burned by the university marshal in the schools quadrangle. Seth Ward extorted from Whitby a retractation (9 October 1683); and he issued a second part of the \"Protestant Reconciler\", urging dissenters to conformity.\n\nIn 1689 Whitby wrote in favour of taking the oaths to William and Mary. He took a small part in the Socinian controversy by publishing (1691) a Latin tract on the divinity of Christ. On 14 April 1696 he received the prebend of Taunton Regis.\n\nWhitby suffered in his later years from failing sight, and employed an amanuensis; otherwise he retained his faculties, including a tenacious memory. He was at church the day before he died; and returning home fainted and died the night following, on 24 March 1726, his eighty-eighth birthday.\n\nHis major work was a 'Paraphrase and Commentary on the New Testament,' begun in 1688 and published in 1700; last edition, 1822. Philip Doddridge thought it preferable to any other commentary. In his commentary he opposes John Tillotson's view of hell torments. Faith he defined as mere assent to Gospel facts as true. In 1710, Whitby challenged the critical works of John Mill and defended Textus Receptus against thirty thousand textual variants in Mill's edition of the New Testament. Of this \"Examen variantium Lectionum Johannis Milli\" use was made by Anthony Collins; it was reprinted (Leyden, 1724) by Sigebert Haverkamp.\n\nDuring 1710–11 Whitby was engaged in refuting the Calvinistic positions of John Edwards. In 1710 he wrote his \"Discourse on the Five Points\" (on the Five Points of Calvinism) which eventually drew Calvinist responses from English Baptist John Gill in his \"The Cause of God and Truth\" (1735) and American Congregationalist Jonathan Edwards in his \"Freedom of the Will\" (1754).\n\nWhitby is usually ranked as an Arminian, but denial of the imputation of Adam's sin carried him beyond Arminian lines. In the Bangorian controversy he wrote (1714 and 1718) in defence of Benjamin Hoadly. On the doctrine of our Lord's deity, which he had defended in 1691 and had upheld throughout his New Testament commentary (1703), he was affected by the treatise (1712) of Samuel Clarke, as shown by his later criticisms of George Bull and Daniel Waterland.\n\nA later Latin dissertation (1714) rejects the authority of the fathers as interpreters of Scripture, or as entitled to determine controversies respecting the Trinity. He had been led to this position by his antagonism (1707) to the arguments on which Henry Dodwell the elder based his rejection of the natural immortality of the soul. He made further use of it in criticisms directed (1718) against Bull and (1720–1) Waterland.\n\nThe extent of his departure from conventional opinion was not revealed till the posthumous publication in April 1727 of his \"Last Thoughts\", which he calls his 'retractation,' and which 'clearly shows his unitarianism'. \n\nConcerning the Whitby's position in respect of the Roman Catholic Church, he published the 1674 pamphlet \"A discourse concerning the idolatry of the Church of Rome\", which was followed by \"A treatise in confutation of the Latin service practised and, by the order of the Trent Council, continued in the Church of Rome\" and also by \"The fallibility of the Roman Church : demonstrated from the manifest error of the 2d Nicene & Trent councils : which assert that the veneration and honorary worship of images is a tradition primitive and apostolical\" (London, 1687). At least from 1699 until 1702, Whitby was also a close friend and an epistolary correspondent of John Locke (1632 – 28 October 1704), which a short time before was returned from Netherlands to the Lady Masham's country house in Essex.\n\nWhitby is considered by many to have systematised postmillennialism, even if seeds of this millennialist belief were sown long before with persons such as Augustine. Although Whitby may have been an Arminian minister, postmillennialism is now commonly associated with Calvinist and Covenantal churches, specifically Reconstructionist churches.\n\nClarence Larkin wrote:\n\n\n"}

The park comprises some of the last remaining sections of the primordial forest of Central Europe, especially spectacular stand of ancient beech trees (Bukowa Gora). It also is a rail junction, located along the Rejowiec Fabryczny - Hrebenne - Munina connection, with a branch line going westwards, to Stalowa Wola, via Biłgoraj.\n\nThe Zwierzyniec settlement was established in the 16th century by the Zamoyski family. \nOne of the features here is an artificial lake with a number of small islands - one of them contains monuments of the hounds belonging to the Polish Queen Marysieńka Sobieska (\"primo voto\" Zamoyska).\n\nOn another island the Zamoyskis built a baroque chapel, which became later the main church of the local Catholic parish.

The Dominion brand name is used under licence from Metro Inc., which discontinued the Dominion banner in the rest of Canada in late 2008 and has no other affiliation with the Newfoundland stores.\n\nThe chain began as Ayre's Supermarkets, a division of local department store chain Ayre and Sons. It was acquired by Argus Corporation via Dominion Stores Ltd. in 1963, eventually adopting the Dominion brand. Following the sale of Dominion to A&P Canada, the Newfoundland operations were resold to local owners in 1987 and subsequently merged with two smaller local chains. The newly-amalgamated parent company was named Amalco Foods, but the combined chain's brand name remained \"Dominion\".\n\nLoblaw acquired the Dominion chain in Newfoundland in 1995, and soon after began implementing its own private-label products and store designs at these locations. Ultimately Dominion's traditional \"Big D\" logo was replaced with a derivative of the Loblaws logo, rotated to look like a D instead of an L. Renovated Dominion stores have changed the orientation of the logo to match the Loblaws logo, but Loblaws stated that it would continue to use the Dominion brand in the region.\n\nIn all respects other than name, the majority of Dominion stores in Newfoundland operate with the same appearance and format as the company's flagship Loblaws and Atlantic Superstore supermarkets, and its newest St. John's area locations are similar in format to the Loblaw-owned Real Canadian Superstore. Since 2002, these locations have in fact been operated as part of the Atlantic Superstore unit, with nearly identical advertising campaigns, including the \"Prices you can trust\" slogan used by both Atlantic Superstore and Real Canadian Superstore. Nonetheless, Loblaw has not indicated any plans to discontinue its use of the Dominion banner.\n\nIn the past few years, the chain has relocated or consolidated a number of locations into the \"market\" or superstore formats. Whereas there were roughly six locations in the early 2000s in St. John's proper (and many more in years past), there are now only three Dominion stores in the city, none built before 2000. This transition culminated with the opening of a Dominion on the site of the former Memorial Stadium in St. John's in 2007. Coincident with that opening, two medium-size locations in the east end of St. John's (older General Supermarket locations acquired in the early 1990s) were closed, while a third (Churchill Square) was converted to a SaveEasy. As a result, it is believed that all Dominion stores in the province have now been transitioned to the newer formats. Since then, SaveEasy in Churchill Square has now closed and the building is vacant. Most of the previous Newfoundland Drive / Torbay Road location is now occupied by a Coleman’s store, with a Bank of Montreal branch occupying the remaining space.\n\nIn 2018, ten Dominion stores across the province were selected by the Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation to operate licensed cannabis retail outlets.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1871226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871226", "title": "Moog synthesizer", "text": "Moog synthesizer\n\nThe Moog synthesizer is a synthesizer developed by the American engineer Robert Moog. Moog debuted it in 1964, and Moog's company R. A. Moog Co. (later known as Moog Music) produced numerous models from 1965 to 1980. It was the first commercial synthesizer, and is credited with creating the analog synthesizer as it is known today.\n\nBy 1963, Moog had been designing and selling theremins for several years. He began developing the Moog synthesizer in response to demand for more practical and affordable electronic music equipment, guided by suggestions and requests from composers including Herb Deutsch, Richard Teitelbaum, Vladimir Ussachevsky, and Wendy Carlos. \n\nThe synthesizer consists of separate modules—such as oscillators, amplifiers, envelope generators, filters, noise generators, ring modulators, triggers and mixers—which create and shape sounds, and can be connected via patch cords. It can be played using controllers including keyboards, joysticks, pedals, and ribbon controllers. Its oscillators can produce waveforms of different timbres, which can be modulated and filtered to produce more combinations of sounds (subtractive synthesis). \n\nMoog's principal innovation was to use voltage to control pitch via a voltage-controlled oscillator. The synthesizer also introduced fundamental synthesizer concepts such as modularity and envelope generation. It was brought to the mainstream by \"Switched-On Bach\" (1968), a bestselling album of Bach compositions arranged for Moog synthesizer by Wendy Carlos. In the late 1960s, the Moog was adopted by rock and pop acts including the Doors, the Grateful Dead, the Rolling Stones, and the Beatles. At its height of popularity, it was a staple of 1970s progressive rock, used by acts including Yes, Tangerine Dream, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. In 1970, Moog Music released a portable, self-contained model, the Minimoog.\n\nIn the early 1960s, electronic music technology was impractical and used mainly by experimental composers to create music with little mainstream appeal. In 1963, American engineer Robert Moog, who designed and sold theremins, met composer Herb Deutsch at a New York State School Music Association trade fair. Deutsch had been making electronic music using a theremin, tape recorder, and single-pitch oscillator, a time-consuming process that involved splicing tape. Recognizing the need for more practical and sophisticated equipment, Moog and Deutsch discussed the notion of a \"portable electronic music studio\". \n\nMoog received a grant of $16,000 from the New York State Small Business Association and began work in Trumansburg, New York. At the time, synthesizer-like instruments filled rooms; Moog hoped to build a more compact instrument that would appeal to musicians. Learning from his experience building a prohibitively expensive guitar amplifier, he believed that practicality and affordability were the most important parameters.\n\nPrevious synthesizers, such as the RCA Mark II, had created sound from hundreds of vacuum tubes. Instead, Moog used recently available silicon transistors — specifically, a transistor with an exponential relationship between input voltage and output current. With this, he created the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), which generated a waveform whose pitch could be adjusted by changing the voltage. Moog designed his synthesizer around a standard of one volt per octave. Similarly, he used voltage to control loudness with voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs).\nMoog developed a prototype with two VCOs and a VCA. Having two VCOs was significant; as the VCOs themselves could output voltage, one could be used to modulate the output of another, creating effects such as vibrato and tremolo. According to Moog, when Deutsch saw this, he \"went through the roof\" and immediately began making music with the prototype, attracting the interest of passersby: \"They would stand there, they’d listen and they’d shake their heads ... What is this weird shit coming out of the basement?\"In 1964, Moog and Deutsch demonstrated the synthesizer at the electronic music studio at the University of Toronto. After the presentation impressed the composers, Moog was invited by the Audio Engineering Society to present at their annual convention in New York that October. Though he had not planned to sell synthesizers there, Moog took \"two or three\" orders at the show, and the choreographer Alwin Nikolais became the first person to purchase a commercially made Moog synthesizer. Moog constructed synthesizers to order. The first order for a complete Moog synthesizer, for which Moog had to design a keyboard and cabinet, came from composer Eric Siday. \n\nMoog refined the synthesizer in response to requests from musicians and composers. For example, after Deutsch suggested Moog find a way to fade notes in and out, Moog invented an envelope module, using a doorbell button as a prototype. At the suggestion of composer Gustav Ciamaga, Moog developed a filter module, a means of removing frequencies from waveforms. His first filter design created a sound similar to a wah-wah pedal; he later developed the distinctive \"ladder\" filter, which was the only item in the synthesizer design that Moog patented, granted on October 28, 1969. Further developments were driven by suggestions from musicians including Richard Teitelbaum, Vladimir Ussachevsky, and Wendy Carlos; it was Carlos who suggested the first touch-sensitive keyboard, portamento control, and filter bank, which became standard features.\n\nMoog initially avoided the word synthesizer, as it was associated with the RCA synthesizer, and instead described his invention as a \"system\" of \"electronic music modules\". The classical meaning of \"to synthesize\" is to assemble a whole out of parts. After many debates, Moog eventually told composer Reynold Weidenaar: \"It’s a synthesizer and that's what it does and we're just going to have to go with it.\" Moog used the word synthesizer in print for the first time in 1966. By the 1970s, \"synthesizer\" had become the standard term for such instruments.\n\nThere was also debate as to the role of the keyboard in synthesizers. Some, such as composer Vladimir Ussachevsky and Moog's competitor Don Buchla, felt they were restrictive. However, Moog recognized that most customers wanted keyboards and found it helped make the instrument approachable; by having users play a keyboard in photographs, it helped create understanding that the synthesizer was for making music. Moog also developed alternative controllers, such as the ribbon controller, which allows users to control pitch similarly to moving a finger along a violin string.\n\nMost of the Moog modules were finalized by the end of the 1960s, and remained mostly unchanged until Moog Music ceased trading in the 1980s. Moog had pursued the development of his synthesizer as a hobby; he stressed that he was not a businessman at the time, and had not known what a balance sheet was. He likened the experience to riding theme park amusements: \"You know you're not going to get hurt too badly because nobody would let you do that, but you’re not quite in control.\" \n\nThe Moog synthesizer consists of separate modules – such as oscillators, amplifiers, envelope generators, filters, noise generators, ring modulators, triggers and mixers – which can be connected in a variety of ways via patch cords. The modules can also be used to control each other. The synthesizer can be played using controllers including keyboards, joysticks, pedals, and ribbon controllers.\n\nThe oscillators can produce different waveforms with different tones and overtones, such as a \"bright, full, brassy\" sawtooth wave, a thinner, flute-like triangle wave, a \"nasal, reedy\" pulse wave, and a \"whistle-like\" sine wave. These waveforms can be modulated and filtered to produce more combinations of sounds (subtractive synthesis). The oscillators were difficult to keep in tune, and small temperature changes would cause them to drift rapidly. As Moog's early customers were more interested in creating experimental music than playing conventional melodies, Moog did not consider keeping them stable a priority. \n\nThe Moog resonant low-pass filter is particularly distinctive, with a \"rich\", \"juicy\", \"fat\" sound. The filter, based on pairs of transistors connected by capacitors arranged in a ladder-like layout, attenuates frequencies above a level set by the user and boosts the frequencies around the cut-off frequency. When overdriven, the filter produces a rich distortion described as \"the Moog sound\".\n\nThe Moog does not produce sound until a workable combination of modules are connected. The open system allows users to connect modules that create no sound. With no Moog books and no way to save or share settings, early users had to learn how to use the synthesizer themselves, by word of mouth, or from seminars held by Moog and Deutsch.\n\nThe Moog was much smaller than previous synthesizers, and much cheaper, at $10,000USD compared to the six-figure sums of other synthesizers. Whereas the RCA Mark II was programmed with punchcards, Moog's synthesizer could be played in real time via keyboard, making it attractive to musicians. \"New Scientist\" described it as the first commercial synthesizer. According to the authors of \"Analog Days,\" \"Though the notion of voltage control and Moog's circuit designs were not original, Moog's innovations were in drawing the elements together, realizing that the problem of exponential conversion could be solved using transistor circuitry and building such circuits and making them work in a way that was of interest to musicians.\" \n\nMost Moog synthesizers were owned by universities or record labels, and used to create soundtracks or jingles; by 1970, only 28 were owned by musicians. The Moog was first used by experimental composers including Richard Teitelbaum, Dick Hyman and Wendy Carlos. In 1968, Carlos released \"Switched-On Bach,\" an album of Bach compositions arranged for Moog synthesizer. It won three Grammy Awards and was the first classical album certified platinum. The album is credited for popularising the Moog and demonstrating that synthesizers could be more than \"random noise machines\".\n\nAn early use in rock music came with the 1967 Monkees album \"Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.\" In 1969, George Harrison of the Beatles released an album of Moog recordings, \"Electronic Sound\", and that year the Moog appeared on the Beatles album \"Abbey Road\" on tracks including \"Because\", \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\". Other rock bands who adopted the Moog include the Doors, the Grateful Dead, and the Rolling Stones. It was also adopted by jazz musicians including Herbie Hancock, Jan Hammer and Sun Ra.\n\nFor a period, the name Moog became so associated with electronic music that it was sometimes used as a generic term for any synthesizer. Numerous novelty records were recorded with titles such as \"Moog Espana\", \"Moog Power\" and \"Music to Moog By.\" Moog said in 1969: \"I like the idea of my name becoming a generic term for the synthesizer, but I don't like the fact that cruddy records are being put out with my name attached.\" He felt there were \"maybe 25 people in the world who have the necessary competence in both physics and music\" to play the Moog well. \n\nIn the 1970s, at the height of the Moog's popularity, it became ubiquitous as part of progressive rock bands such as Yes, Tangerine Dream, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Keith Emerson was the first major rock musician to perform live with the Moog, and it became a trademark of his performances; according to \"Analog Days\", the likes of Emerson \"did for the keyboard what Jimi Hendrix did for the guitar\". In later decades, hip hop groups such as the Beastie Boys and rock bands including They Might Be Giants and Wilco \"have revived an interest in the early Moog synthesizer timbres\".\n\nThe \"Guardian\" wrote that the Moog synthesizer, with its dramatically new sounds, arrived at a time in American history when, in the wake of the Vietnam War, \"nearly everything about the old order was up for revision\". With its ability to imitate instruments such as strings and horns, synthesizers threatened the jobs of session musicians. For a period, the Moog was banned from use in commercial work, a restriction negotiated by the American Federation of Musicians (AFM). Robert Moog felt that the AFM had not realized that the synthesizer was an instrument to be learnt and mastered like any other, and instead imagined that \"all the sounds that musicians could make somehow existed in the Moog — all you had to do was push a button that said 'Jascha Heifetz' and out would come the most fantastic violin player\".\n\nMoog features such as voltage-controlled oscillator, envelopes, noise generators, filters, and sequencers became standards in the synthesizer market. According to the \"Guardian\", Moog's \"1964 paper \"Voltage-Controlled Music Modules\" – which initially proposed the idea – invented the analogue synth as we know it.\"\n\nIn 1970, Moog Music released the Minimoog, a portable, self-contained model, and the modular systems became a secondary part of Moog's business. The Minimoog has been described as the most famous and influential synthesizer in history. \n\nAfter the sale of Moog Music, production of Moog synthesizers stopped in the early 1980s. The patents and other rights to Moog's modular circuits expired in the 1990s. In 2002, after Robert Moog regained the rights to the Moog brand and bought the company, Moog released the Minimoog Voyager, an updated version. In 2016, Moog released a new version of the original Minimoog.\n\n\n"}

After the UK locations were sold to Carphone Warehouse in 1999 and the Australian locations to Woolworths Limited in 2001 the company's primary asset was the RadioShack franchise for Canada. InterTAN's relationship with RadioShack was terminated in 2005, after InterTAN became a wholly owned subsidiary of Circuit City on May 19, 2004.\n\nInterTAN Canada Ltd. was a Canadian consumer electronics retailer based in Barrie, Ontario, Canada that operated stores under the banner \"The Source by Circuit City\" and a single \"THS Studio\" location. The Rogers Plus chain was previously operated by InterTAN on behalf of Rogers Communications; the chain is now managed directly by Rogers. As well, conversion or closure of all UpClose and G-Wiz stores, as well as all but one THS Studio, was completed in 2006.\n\nInterTAN filed for bankruptcy protection (under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act) at the same time as its U.S. parent in late 2008. However, the Canadian division was not directly affected by Circuit City's liquidation process announced on January 16, 2009. Bell Canada subsequently announced an agreement to purchase the bulk of InterTAN's assets, specifically The Source.\n\nInterTAN, the corporate entity, was not included in the sale (rather it was itself the seller), and is therefore now considered defunct.\n\nInterTAN Inc. was a wholly owned subsidiary of Tandy Corporation of Fort Worth, Texas, which owned retail operations in the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, West Germany, Canada and the United States. Its name being a shortened version of International Tandy. It had estimated annual sales of US$400 million and assets of US$250 million and accounted for 13 percent of the company's annual sales.\n\nIt was decided to \"spin off\" the international retail operations and a separate corporation, InterTAN Inc., was created, with two subsidiaries InterTAN Canada Ltd. and InterTAN Australia Ltd.. The company became a separate entity from Tandy Corporation on 20 June 1986, with InterTAN Canada Ltd. to oversee 873 stores in Canada and 894 stores in Europe and InterTAN Australia Ltd. to oversee 350 stores in Australia.\n\nBy 1988, the company had closed unprofitable stores in many countries, including in West Germany.\n\nThe French stores were bankrupt by the end of December 1993, shut down along with the Belgian stores and distribution centre. Carphone Warehouse bought the remaining British shops in 1999, one year after InterTAN had closed 69 of the 338 UK Tandy stores.\n\nIn April 2001, InterTAN Australia Limited trading as Tandy Electronics was sold to Woolworths Limited for A$112.6 million with 222 stores.\n\nInterTAN was reduced to being the parent company for the Canadian consumer electronics business only. Product offerings occasionally differed from the US chain; a 1989 decision to drop the Tandy Colour Computer in Canada drew a small-scale backlash and InterTAN often carried non-RadioShack items alongside the core Tandy line.\n\nUntil June 30, 2005, InterTAN ran stores under the banner RadioShack in Canada, as it had a licensing agreement with the RadioShack Corporation until 2010 to use the American company's trademarks. However, after a purchase of InterTAN by Circuit City Stores, Inc. in 2004, the RadioShack Corporation sued to have that agreement terminated. While that lawsuit was approved in the State of Texas, it was not legally binding in Canada. InterTan filed a lawsuit in Canada stating that since the purchase by Circuit City Stores, Inc. was for only 80% of InterTAN, the latter was still a viable company and thus entitled to keep using the name RadioShack. InterTAN and RadioShack came to a temporary deal by which InterTAN is banned from using the former moniker since July 1, 2005, and as such, all corporate retail consumer electronics stores, and most dealer stores, formerly known as \"RadioShack\" are known as \"The Source\". The matter was settled in late 2006; however, the details of the settlement were not made public. RadioShack made a token effort to re-enter the Canadian market in 2005 with nine stores, which it abandoned in January 2007. Remaining RadioShack-branded inventory began to appear in Liquidation World bins in Canada in 2007.\n\nFormer InterTAN CEO Brian Levy later became an ER medical doctor.\n\nInterTAN had entered into arrangements with Rogers Communications to run a chain of stores under the Rogers Plus banner, using InterTAN's point-of-sale systems and knowledge of retail operations for the day-to-day management of the stores. This partnership was renewed as part of the Circuit City acquisition, and was set to expire in January 2007.\n\nIn April 2002, InterTAN, already one of Canada's largest battery retailers with its RadioShack stores, acquired certain assets and locations of Battery Plus and merged it into its retail operations.\n\nIn the first two months of 2007, InterTAN underwent drastic changes. By closing all but one THS Studio location, as well as all but one Battery Plus location, InterTAN began to focus on its core operation: The Source By Circuit City. InterTAN continued closing underperforming locations through the end of February 2007, resulting in the loss of employment for almost 100 Canadians. The positions varied from sales associates, store managers, store assistant managers, district managers, service centre managers, even regional vice presidents.\n\nCircuit City announced that they had retained Goldman Sachs to explore selling off InterTAN in Q1, 2007. Circuit City USA went bankrupt in 2009, during the Great Recession. \"The Source\" was sold as a going concern to Bell Canada Enterprises.\n\n\n"}

However, it was for his directorial efforts on his next project that Benedek is best remembered. His motorcycle gang film \"The Wild One\" (1953) caused a storm of controversy and was banned in the United Kingdom until 1968.\nHe was born in Budapest. He intended to be a psychiatrist and studied at Vienna and Berlin. He worked in the film industry to pay his bills and ended up deciding to focus on that instead.\n\nIn Germany, Benedek was cinematographer on \"The Mistress\" (1927). He was assistant director on \"The Great Longing\" (1929), directed by Steve Sekely, and edited and assisted directed \"The Man Who Murdered\" (1931) for director Curtis Bernhardt.

The Coudenhoves were Counts of the Holy Roman Empire since 1790 and were prominent in the Netherlands and Belgium. After the upheaval of the French Revolution, they went to Austria. The Kallergis family had enjoyed high status in Crete having been sent there by Byzantine emperor Alexios II Komnenos in the mid-12th century.. They remained there during the Venetian occupation 1204-1669 and subsequently moved to Venetian held Ionian Islands. Their palazzo in Venice is still there.\n\nThe Coudenhove family dates back to the Duchy of Brabant nobleman and crusader Gerolf I de Coudenhove (died 1259) and after it fought for the Habsburgs in the Dutch Revolt, the family moved to Flanders before the Habsburgs and Coudenhoves left after the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium) was taken by the Revolutionary French Republic.\n\nThe Kallergis family is a Cretan family and claimed descent from the Byzantine Phokas family, which produced several generals and an emperor (Nikephoros II). During the Venetian rule over Crete, the Kallergis family was one of the most important Greek Orthodox families on the island.\n\nThe two families united when, on 27 June 1857 in Paris, Count Franz Karl von Coudenhove (1825–1893) married Marie Kalergi, only daughter of Polish pianist Maria Nesselrode and her husband, Jan Kalergis.

This is even more unlikely than a successful wager in the trifecta, which requires correctly picking the first three finishers in order, and as such will have a correspondingly higher payoff.\n\nMost exotic wagers in horseracing are a 1 dollar minimum. Due to the difficulty of the superfecta, some racetracks have lowered the minimum on the superfecta to 10 cents. This 10 cent bet is very popular with the fans as it permits a bettor with a small bankroll to cover many combinations and still have a chance for a large payoff.\n\nDue to the imprecise nature of the name (as opposed to other bets such as the trifecta), superfecta bets can sometimes require selecting more than four horses. For instance, the New South Wales TAB in Australia previously offered a superfecta bet on selected races requiring bettors to pick the first \"six\" finishers in the correct order, rather than four. The bet requiring the selection of four finishers in order is instead referred to by most Australian totalisators as a First Four bet (or in Western Australia as a \"Quartet\").

Charles DeWeese started developing MyFXP in Visual Basic 4, but he soon realized that Visual Basic fell short in many areas. A dear friend, the author of LeapFTP, suggested that he use Borland Delphi. Therefore, DeWeese switched to Borland Delphi 4. Although the original name was MyFXP, the program was later renamed to FlashFXP, and on June 24, 1998, FlashFXP was started. Nearly a month later, on July 23, 1998, FlashFXP 1.0 was released.\n\nVersion 1.2 was the first shareware version of FlashFXP.\n\nVersion 2.0 was a significant milestone for FlashFXP by providing SSL/TLS support.\n\nBy 2003, FlashFXP became successful. As a result, Charles DeWeese was simply unable to keep up with the development, support, and sales by himself. He later signed an exclusive deal with iniCom Networks, Inc and released version 3.0.\n\nIn late 2009, FlashFXP became part of the newly formed Opensight Software, LLC, which Charles is sole owner of. Sales are fully automated via share-it, PayPal, and the FlashFXP website, although support is really provided by the developer and other people at the support forums.\n\nVersion 4.0 included additional functionality, advanced features and has been reviewed as being more extensive compared to free FTP clients.\n\n\n"}

Generally, these investors include friends and family, accredited investors, and institutional investors. \n\nPIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) deals are one type of private placement. SEDA (Standby Equity Distribution Agreement) is also a form of private placement. They are often a cheaper source of capital than a public offering.\n\nSince private placements are not offered to the general public, they are prospectus exempt. Instead, they are issued through Offering Memorandum. Private placements come with a great deal of administration and are have normally been sold through financial institutions such as investment banks. New FinTech companies now offer an automated, online process making it easier to reach potential investors and reduce the administration.\n\nAlthough these placements are subject to the Securities Act of 1933, the securities offered do not have to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission if the issuance of the securities conforms to an exemption from registrations as set forth in the Securities Act of 1933 and the associated SEC rules put into effect. Most private placements are offered under the Rules known as Regulation D. Different rules under Regulation D provide stipulations for offering a Private Placement, such as required financial criteria for investors or solicitation allowances. Private placements may typically consist of offers of common stock or preferred stock or other forms of membership interests, warrants or promissory notes (including convertible promissory notes), bonds, and purchasers are often institutional investors such as banks, insurance companies or pension funds. Common exemptions from the Securities Act of 1933 allow an unlimited number of accredited investors to purchase securities in an offering. Generally, accredited investors are those with a net worth in excess of $1 million or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 combined with a spouse. Under these exemptions, no more than 35 non-accredited investors may participate in a private placement. In most cases, all investors must have sufficient financial knowledge and experience to be capable of evaluating the risks and merits of investing in a company.\n\nThomson Reuters provides annual and semiannual rankings of private placement agencies by capital raised.\n\n"}

Hirschman\n\nAlbert Otto Hirschman (born \"Otto-Albert Hirschmann\"; April 7, 1915 – December 10, 2012) was an economist and the author of several books on political economy and political ideology. His first major contribution was in the area of development economics. Here he emphasized the need for unbalanced growth. He argued that disequilibria should be encouraged to stimulate growth and help mobilize resources, because developing countries are short of decision making skills. Key to this was encouraging industries with many linkages to other firms.\n\nHis later work was in political economy and there he advanced two schemata. The first describes the three basic possible responses to decline in firms or polities (quitting, speaking up, staying quiet) in \"Exit, Voice, and Loyalty\" (1970). The second describes the basic arguments made by conservatives (perversity, futility and jeopardy) in \"The Rhetoric of Reaction\" (1991).\n\nIn World War II, he played a key role in rescuing refugees in occupied France.\n\nOtto Albert Hirschman was born in 1915 into an affluent Jewish family in Berlin, Germany, the son of Carl Hirschmann, a surgeon and Hedwig Marcuse Hirschmann. He had a sister, Ursula Hirschmann. In 1932, he started studying at Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität, continued at the Sorbonne, the London School of Economics and the University of Trieste, where he received his doctorate in economics in 1938.\n\nIn the summer of 1936, Hirschman spent three months as a volunteer fighting on behalf of the Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War. After France surrendered to the Nazis, he worked with Varian Fry from the Emergency Rescue Committee to help many of Europe's leading artists and intellectuals to escape to the United States; Hirschman helped to lead them from occupied France to Spain through paths in the Pyrenees Mountains and then to Portugal.\n\nFrom 1941–1943 he was a Rockefeller Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. He served in the United States Army (1943–1946) where he worked in the Office of Strategic Services. \nfrom 1946–1952 he was appointed Chief of the Western European and British Commonwealth Section of the Federal Reserve Board. \nFrom 1952–1954 he was a financial advisor to the National Planning Board of Colombia and the next 2 years made a living as a private economic counselor in Bogotá.\n\nThereafter he held a succession of academic appointments in economics; from 1956–1958 at Yale University, from 1958–1964 at Columbia University, and for 10 years at Harvard University (1964–1974). He worked for the Institute for Advanced Study from 1974–2012 until his death.\n\nHe died at the age of 97 on December 10, 2012, some months after the passing of his wife of over seventy years, Sarah Hirschman (née Chapiro).\n\nHis first major contribution was in the area of development economics with the 1958 book The Strategy of Economic Development. Here he emphasized the need for unbalanced growth. He argued that disequilibria should be encouraged to stimulate growth and help mobilize resources, because developing countries are short of decision making skills. Key to this was encouraging industries with many linkages to other firms.\n\nIn his 1967 essay \"The principle of the hiding hand\"Hirschman helped develop the hiding hand principle.\n\nHis later work was in political economy, where he advanced two schemata. In \"Exit, Voice, and Loyalty\" (1970) he described the three basic possible responses to decline in firms or polities (quitting, speaking up, staying quiet). \nThe second describes the basic arguments made by conservatives (perversity, futility and jeopardy) in \"The Rhetoric of Reaction\" (1991).\n\nIn \"The Passions and the Interests\" Hirschmann recounts a history of the ideas laying the intellectual groundwork for capitalism. He describes how thinkers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries embraced the sin of avarice as an important counterweight to humankind's destructive passions. Capitalism was promoted by thinkers including Montesquieu, Sir James Steuart, and Adam Smith as repressing the passions for \"harmless\" commercial activities. Hirschman noted that terms including \"vice\" and \"passion\" gave way to \"such bland terms\" as \"advantage\" and \"interest.\" Hirschman described it as the book he most enjoyed writing. According to Hirschman biographer Jeremy Adelman, it reflected Hirschman's political moderation, a challenge to reductive accounts of human nature by economists as a \"utility-maximizing machine\" as well as Marxian or communitarian \"nostalgia for a world that was lost to consumer avarice.\" \n\nIn 1945, Hirschman proposed a market concentration index which was the square root of the sum of the squares of the market share of each participant in the market. In 1950, Orris C. Herfindahl proposed a similar index (but without the square root), apparently unaware of the prior work. Thus, it is usually referred to as the Herfindahl-Hirschman index.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2001, Hirschman was named among the top 100 American intellectuals, as measured by academic citations, in Richard Posner's book, \"Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline.\"\n\nIn 2003, he won the Benjamin E. Lippincott Award from the American Political Science Association to recognize a work of exceptional quality by a living political theorist for his book \"The Passions and the Interests: Political Arguments for Capitalism before Its Triumph\".\n\nIn 2007, the Social Science Research Council established an annual prize in honor of Hirschman.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1871412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871412", "title": "Komotini", "text": "Komotini\n\nKomotini (; ; ) is a city in the region of East Macedonia and Thrace, northeastern Greece. It is the capital of the Rhodope regional unit. It was the administrative centre of the Rhodope-Evros super-prefecture until its abolition in 2010, by the Kallikratis Plan. The city is home to the Democritus University of Thrace, founded in 1973. Komotini is home to a sizeable Turkish-speaking Muslim minority.\n\nBuilt at the northern part of the plain bearing the same name, Komotini is one of the main administrative, financial and cultural centers of northeastern Greece and also a major agricultural and breeding center of the area. It is also a significant transport interchange, located 795 km NE of Athens and 281 km NE of Thessaloniki. The presence of the Democritus University makes Komotini the home of thousands of Greek and international students and this, combined with an eclectic mix of Western and Oriental elements in the city's daily life, have made it an increasingly attractive tourist destination.\n\nThe city stands at an altitude of 32-38m on the Thracian plain near the foothills of the Rhodope Mountains. It is situated between two rivers, Boklutzas on the west and Trelohimaros on the east (which form, alongside the Karidia stream, the river Bosbozis). There is little urban planning in the older parts of city, in contrast to more recently developed quarters. According to the 2011 census, the municipality's population amounts to 66,919, a number that does not include approximately 12,000 resident students, trainees and soldiers. There are two airports near Komotini. The nearest is in Alexandroupoli (65 km), and the other is in Kavala (80 km). It has rail and bus links to all continental Greek cities as well as Istanbul, and the good provincial road network has been supplemented by the new Egnatia Odos motorway.\n\nKomotini has existed as a settlement since the 2nd century AD. That is confirmed by archaeological finds of that era up until the 4th century. It is also confirmed by an inscription on the ruins of the 4th-century Byzantine wall, that are visible at various sites in the city, which reads \"\"Theodosiou Ktisma\"\" = Building of Theodosius. The inscription was discovered by the Komotini-born Prof. Stilponas Kyriakidis and the then mayor Sofoklis Komninos. It is said that the settlement originates from the 5th century and is linked to the daughter of the painter Parrasios from Maroneia. During the Roman age it was one of several fortresses along the Via Egnatia highway which existed in the Thrace area. Probably it is to be identified with the Roman station \"Breierophara\" (a Thracian toponym from bre (=fortress) + iero (= holy) + phara=para (=pass). The most important city of that period was neighbouring Maximianopolis, former Thracian Porsulis or Paesoulae, which was renamed to Mosynopolis in the 9th century. Komotini was a Via Egnatia hub on its northern route through the Nymphaea Pass which led to the Ardas Valley, Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv) and Byzantine Berroe (modern Stara Zagora).\n\nThe city's history is closely connected with that of Via Egnatia, the Roman trunk road which connected Dyrrhachium with Constantinople. The Roman emperor Theodosius I built a small rectilinear fortress on the road at a junction with a route leading north across the Rhodope Mountains toward Philippopolis. During the Byzantine period, the city belonged to the Theme of Macedonia, whilst from the 11th century it could be found within the newly founded theme of Boleron. For most of its early existence the settlement was overshadowed by the larger town of Mosynopolis to the west, and by the end of the 12th century, the place had been completely abandoned.\n\nThe current settlement dates to 1207, when, following the destruction of Mosynopolis by the Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan, the remnant population fled and established themselves within the walls of the abandoned fortress. Since then the population had been increasing continuously until it became an important town within the area. In 1331 John Kantakouzenos referred to her as \"Koumoutzina\" in his account of the Byzantine civil war of 1321–1328. In 1332 Andronikos III Palaiologos set camp in Komotini to face Umur Bey of Smyrna at the Panagia village close to the Panagia Vathirryakos (Fatirgiaka) monastery. However, Umur departed without a battle. In 1341 the historian Nikephoros Phokas referred to the town with its current name. In 1343, during the civil war between John VI Kantakouzenos and John V Palaiologos, Komotini along with the neighbouring forts of Asomatos, Paradimi, Kranovouni and Stylario joined Kantakouzenos' side. John VI Kantakouzenos escaped to Komotini to survive from a battle with the army of the Bulgarian brigand Momchil near the already ruined Mosynopolis.\n\nThe city was captured by the Ottoman Empire between 1361 and 1362/3, apparently by Gazi Evrenos Bey. Its conquest is placed after the fall of Philippopolis and Stara Zagora, but before the Ottoman capture of Pegae. Already before that, it was called in Turkish as Gümülcine, a version of the demotic Greek form of the city's name, Koumoutsinas. This remained the city's name throughout the Ottoman period (ca. 1361–1912) and continues as its modern Turkish-language name today.\n\nThe city continued to be an important hub connecting the capital city of Constantinople with the European part of the Empire, and grew accordingly. Many monuments in the city today date to this era. Many local families fled at that time to Epirus and founded the Koumoutzades village (modern Ammotopos, Arta). Even there they were persecuted and some of them found refuge in Tropaia of Gortynia. The bond between the inhabitants of Komotini, Ammotopos and Tropaia exists to this day.\n\nIn the first two decades after its conquest, until 1383, the city was the seat of a frontier march (\"uç\") under Evrenos, confronting the Serbian territories of Macedonia. The walled city continued to be inhabited by Greek Christians, but Evrenos brought in Turkish settlers to the countryside around the town. From the prevailingly Turkish toponymy of the area, it appears that the region was largely deserted, and subsequent Ottoman censuses show that Muslim Turks quickly became the dominant element in the rural districts around the city. Evrenos also built a \"masjid\" (small mosque), an imaret, bath, and shops outside the city walls, establishing a \"waqf\" that according to Machiel Kiel became the \"nucleus of Islamic life in Western Thrace\". The 16th-century geographer Mehmed-i Ashik also mentions a hostel (\"imaret\") built by Evrenos.\n\nIn the 1519 census, the city numbered 393 Muslim households and 197 single (unmarried or widowed) Muslims, 42 Christian households and 14 single Christians, and 19 Jewish households and 5 single Jews, in total ca. 2,500 people. In the 1530 census, the 17 Turkish-named neighbourhoods (\"mahalle\") are mentioned, as well as the existence of one Friday mosque, 16 \"masjids\", 4 \"zawiyas\", 4 schools, and a single church (in the walled city). Nevertheless, the French traveller Pierre Bellon du Mans, who visited the city in 1548, stated that \"the city is inhabited by Greeks and a few Turks\". In the 1600s, the town was graced by new buildings—a small Friday mosque, a double bath, a \"mekteb\", a \"madrasah\", and an \"imaret\"—by the \"defterdar\" Ekmekcizade Ahmed Pasha, who sponsored numerous such works throughout Thrace. Ahmed's mosque, the Yeni Mosque, which survives to this day, is the only structure in Greece to feature Iznik tiles from the 1580s, the zenith of the Iznik potters' art. When the traveller Evliya Çelebi visited the town in 1667/8, he found \"4,000 prosperous, stone-built houses\"—likely an exaggeration—in 16 \"mahalles\", with 5 main mosques, 11 \"masjids\", 2 \"imarets\", 2 baths, 5 \"madrasahs\", 7 \"mektebs\", 17 caravanserais, and 400 shops.\n\nThe town suffered greatly from repeated plague epidemics, which led to entire villages being abandoned, but recovered in the 19th century. During the Greek War of Independence Komotini's inhabitants contributed substantially with Ioannikios (later bishop), Aggelis Kirzalis and Captain Stavros Kobenos (members of the Filiki Eteria organisation). During the following decades Komotini progressed financially due to the processing and trade of tobacco. Greeks took advantage of the religious liberty granted by the Ottomans and completely controlled the economic activity of the city.\n\nThe 19th century saw the city expand and considerable architectural activity, with the renovation of old and the construction of new buildings. Both the Yeni Mosque and Evrenos' original \"masjid\", the Eski Mosque, were enlarged by the addition of spacious prayer halls, while Sultan Abdulhamid II erected a clock tower and a \"madrasah\". During his reign, the town became a station in the railway linking Constantinople with Salonica. By the 1880s, the city, capital of the homonymous \"sanjak\" in the Edirne Vilayet, boasted 13,560 inhabitants, 10 Friday mosques, 15 \"masjids\", 2 Greek and one Armenian church, a synagogue, 4 \"madrasahs\", two higher schools, ten \"mektebs\", and various other Christian and Jewish schools.\n\nAfter the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, a new wave of Muslim refugees arrived in Komotini. During that period the area found itself under Bulgarian self-awareness which originated in the rise of Bulgarian nationalism. In 1880 a Girls School and a Boys Urban School were functioning. In 1885 the cultural association 'Omonoia' was founded and it contributed in the cultural life of the city by presenting theatrical plays and concerts. Great benefactors such as Nestor Tsanaklis (builder of the Tsanakleios School, Dimitrios Sintos et al.) rose during that era. Remarkable people that were born in Komotini include Alexandros Symeonidis (Professor of Medicine at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki) and Victoria Margaritopoulou (one of the first Greek female doctors).\n\nDuring the First Balkan War, Bulgarian forces captured the city, only to surrender it to the Greek army during the Second Balkan War on July 14, 1913.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Second Balkan War, it became briefly the capital of the short-lived Provisional Government of Western Thrace, but the Treaty of Bucharest, however, handed the city back to Bulgaria. The city was part of Bulgaria until the end of World War I. During this period, the city had the Bulgarian name Гюмюрджина \"Gyumyurdžina\". In 1919 after the end of WWI, with the Treaty of Neuilly, Komotini was handed to Greece, along with the rest of Western Thrace.\n\nThe population is quite multilingual for a city of its size and it is made up of local Greeks, Greek refugees from Asia Minor and East Thrace, Muslims of Turkish, Pomak and Romani origins, descendants of refugees who survived the Armenian Genocide, and Pontic Greeks from north-eastern Anatolia and the regions of the former Soviet Union (mainly Georgia, Armenia, Russia and Kazakhstan).\n\nThe Muslim population of East Macedonia and Thrace dates to the Ottoman period, and unlike the Muslims of Macedonia and Epirus, was exempted from the 1922-23 Greek-Turkish population exchange following the Treaty of Lausanne.\n\nKomotini is, nowadays, a thriving commercial and administrative centre. It is heavily centralised with the majority of commerce and services based around the historical core of the city. Getting around on foot is therefore very practical. However, traffic can be remarkably heavy due to the daily commute. In the past, the Trelohimaros river used to flow through the city and divide it into two parts. In the 1970s, after repeated flooding episodes the river was eventually diverted and flows on the east of the city, while its former bed has been replaced by the main avenues of the city (like the Orfeos Street).\n\nAt the heart of the city lie the evergreen Municipal Central Park and the 15 m-high WW2 Heroes' Memorial, locally known as 'The Sword'. The revamped Central square or \"Plateia Irinis\" (Square of Peace) is the focus of a vibrant nightlife boosted by the huge number of students living in the city. The Old commercial centre is very popular with tourists as it houses traditional shops and workshops that have long vanished from other Greek cities. In addition, in the northwestern outskirts of the city (Nea Mosinoupoli) locals and tourists alike flock into a modern shopping plaza: Kosmopolis Park, which houses department stores, shops, supermarkets, a cinema complex, cafés and restaurants. The area stretching from Kosmopolis to Ifaistos is gradually becoming a retail destination in its own right.\n\nKomotini began life as a Byzantine Fortress built by the Emperor Theodosius in the 4th century AD. The ruins of this quadrangular structure can still be found NW of the central square. Komotini has several museums including the Archaeological, Byzantine and Folklore museums. SW of the central square one can find the Open-air Municipal Theatre, which hosts many cultural shows and events such as the cultural summer (πολιτιστικό καλοκαίρι = \"politistiko kalokairi\"). There is a Regional Theatre (DIPETHE) whose company produces many plays all year round. NE of Komotini is the Nymfaia forest. It has recreational facilities which comprise trails, courts, playgrounds and space for environmental studies. The forest is divided by a paved road which leads to the ruins of yet another Byzantine fortress and the historical (WWII) fort of Nymfaia.\n\nWritings in the area of ancient Maroneia confirm the presence of Jews in the area. In the 16th century the Jewish community of Komotini consisted of Sephardite Jews who were textile and wool merchants. Many of the Jews had come to Komotini as immigrants from Edirne and Thessaloniki. The community was concentrated within the ancient walls of the city where the Synagogue was built in the 18th century. It was destroyed during WWII. In 1900 there were 1,200 Jews. In 1910 the Alliance Israelite Universelle School started functioning. Greek, French and Hebrew were taught in the school. In 1912–13 many Jews moved to larger cities such as Thessaloniki and Istanbul. After the liberation of Komotini (May 1920) the Israelite community of Komotini had a Cultural Club and Charity organisations. During the Bulgarian administration, the Bulgarians (Nazi allies) arrested 863 Jews and sent them to the concentration camp of Treblinka where they were exterminated (28 survived the Holocaust). In 1958 the Israelite community was dissolved due to lack of members. In 2004 the municipality of Komotini created a memorial (southern entrance of Central Park) for the victims of the Holocaust.\n\nThe municipality Komotini was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 3 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\n\nThe municipality has an area of 644.934 km, the municipal unit 385.386 km.\n\n\n\nThe province of Komotini () was one of the provinces of the Rhodope Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipalities Komotini and Iasmos, and the municipal units Maroneia and Organi. It was abolished in 2006.\n\nThere are more than adequate primary and secondary education facilities in the city. There are around 20 primary schools, 7 gymnasia (junior high schools) and 4 lykeia (high schools) as well as the Institute for Vocational Training (IEK Komotini). In addition there is 2 technical education institutes (TEE).\n\nKomotini is an established university city in the North of Greece. It is home to the Central Administration and several departments of the Democritus University of Thrace including the following:\n\n\nThe Komotini campus has a dynamic population of approximately 5–10.000 students and a major part of social life evolves around it. The founding of the University of Thrace in 1973 has had a significant positive influence on the entire urban area fuelling the city's expansion and growth.\n\nThe Police Academy is located from Komotini on the road to Xanthi on extensive grounds and with modern facilities.\n\nThe main television station based in Komotini is R Channel although other stations broadcast from the city, namely Delta from neighbouring Alexandroupoli and ET3 (the northern branch of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation) from Thessaloniki.\n\nThe main Radio Stations broadcasting from Komotini are:\n\n\nThere has been increasing activity in this sector for the last 50 years. There are now 7 daily and 2 weekly active newspapers in the city.\n\n\nAll of the above are paper based. However, there is an increasing volume of news and content that is on the newspapers' websites. The latter can be accessed from the news section of Komotini's commercial portal.\n\nKomotini is a midland city and has no port. It is served by two airports. The nearest is in Alexandroupoli (65 km), and the other is in Kavala (80 km).\n\nEuropean route E90 runs through the city and connects Komotini with the other Greek Continental cities. The Egnatia Motorway (A2) lies south of the city. One can enter the city from one of two Junctions; 'Komotini West' and 'Komotini East'.\n\nThere are a number of municipal buses serving 3 main lines within the city. The Intercity Bus Company of Komotini connects it to many local villages, the coastal areas and major Greek cities.\n\nThe city is served by OSE, with trains running regularly at least twice daily westwards to Thessaloniki and Athens and eastwards to Evros and occasionally Istanbul. The station is located outside the city Center.\n\nThere is an impressive array of sports facilities available. They include the Komotini Municipal Stadium (Home of Panthrakikos FC), Panthrakiko Stadium (training grounds), Municipal Sports Complex (NE of the city), Municipal Swimming pool and Basketball Arena, Democritus University Sports Complex including an Arena and an Aquatic Centre as well as basketball courts in almost every school in the city. The mountainous area in the north of the city is ideal for mountain-biking and trekking as well as 4x4 racing both of which take place throughout the year.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1871417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871417", "title": "Exit, Voice, and Loyalty", "text": "Exit, Voice, and Loyalty\n\nExit, Voice, and Loyalty (1970) is a treatise written by Albert O. Hirschman (1915–2012). The work hinges on a conceptual ultimatum that confronts consumers in the face of deteriorating quality of goods: either \"exit\" or \"voice\". The book has been described as influential. The framework presented in the book has been applied to topics such as protest movements, migration, political parties, and interest groups, as well as to personal relationships. \n\nThe basic concept are as follows: members of an organization, whether a business, a nation or any other form of human grouping, have essentially two possible responses when they perceive that the organization is demonstrating a decrease in quality or benefit to the member: they can \"exit\" (withdraw from the relationship); or, they can \"voice\" (attempt to repair or improve the relationship through communication of the complaint, grievance or proposal for change). For example, the citizens of a country may respond to increasing political repression in two ways: emigrate or protest. Similarly, employees can choose to quit their unpleasant job, or express their concerns in an effort to improve the situation. Disgruntled customers can choose to shop elsewhere, or they ask for the manager.\n\nExit and voice themselves represent a union between economic and political action. Exit is associated with Adam Smith's invisible hand, in which buyers and sellers are free to move silently through the market, constantly forming and destroying relationships. Voice, on the other hand, is by nature political and at times confrontational.\n\nWhile both exit and voice can be used to measure a decline in an organization, voice is by nature more informative in that it also provides reasons for the decline. Exit, taken alone, only provides the warning sign of decline. Exit and voice also interact in unique and sometimes unexpected ways; by providing greater opportunity for feedback and criticism, exit can be reduced; conversely, stifling of dissent leads to increased pressure for members of the organization to use the only other means available to express discontent, departure. The general principle, therefore, is that the greater the availability of exit, the less likely voice will be used. However, the interplay of \"loyalty\" can affect the cost-benefit analysis of whether to use exit or voice. Where there is loyalty to the organization (as evidenced by strong patriotism politically, or brand loyalty for consumers), exit may be reduced, especially where options to exit are not so appealing (small job market, political or financial hurdles to emigration or moving). Loyal members become especially devoted to the organization's success when their voice will be heard and when they can reform it.\n\nBy understanding the relationship between exit and voice, and the interplay that loyalty has with these choices, organizations can craft the means to better address their members' concerns and issues, and thereby effect improvement. Failure to understand these competing pressures can lead to organizational decline and possible failure.\n\nMembership organizations, whether they be professional, community-based or business-oriented, face the perpetual challenge of knowing how engaged members are; how likely they are to remain members; and when they might cease to be members. Exit, Voice and Loyalty can be observed, reviewed and addressed as a matter of course, and in a learning organization, can result in reduced member \"churn\" and increased growth in member satisfaction, loyalty, referrals and growth. This usually entails some sort of survey efforts, social media inquiries, polling and individual interviews and/or group to maintain the necessary information for the organization to adapt to its members' needs.\n\nSome studies confirm Hirschman's assertion that greater exit and entry costs heighten the likelihood of voice. Particularly when examining dispute resolution in contexts with limited exit opportunities, increased entry costs make workers' voice more likely.\n\nA key application of Hirschman's scheme of exit, voice and loyalty has been emigration. Drawing on the analogy of discontent consumers buying elsewhere, \"exit\" translated into leaving a country and migrating to a different nation-state, while \"voice\" described the option of articulating discontent, which as Hirschman noted, \"can be graduated, all the way from faint grumbling to violent protest\". Hirschman modeled these options as mutually exclusive and postulated a seesaw mechanism: the easier available the exit option, the lower the likelihood of voice. For rulers, emigration served as a safety-valve, by which the discontent renounced on their possibility to articulate protest. \"Latin American powerholders have long encouraged their political enemies and potential critics to remove themselves from the scene through voluntary exile. The right of asylum, so generously practiced by all Latin American republics, could almost be considered as a 'conspiracy in restraint of voice'.\" However, not always did \"exit subvert voice\", as Hirschman himself acknowledged in a 1993 article. In 1989, in the GDR it was the escalating dynamic of out-migration that led those who wanted to stay to take to the streets to demand change. Exit triggered voice, and both worked in tandem.\n\nMoreover, Hirschman's scheme assumes a model of nation-states as a jigsaw puzzle of clearly delimited \"containers\", and migration as the process of unidirectionally moving from one container to another. The emergence of transnational migration diagnosed since the 1990s has challenged this assumption. As emigrants increasingly maintain strong social ties (loyalty) to their country of origin, including a claim to have a say in its public affairs (voice) – Hoffmann argues – in transnational migration exit, voice and loyalty are no longer exclusive options; the nature of migrant transnationalism is defined precisely by the overlapping and simultaneity of these categories.\n\nAn example of this phenomenon can be found regarding students from Ghana, who intended to migrate for a chance at an overall better quality of life, more career options, and a possibility of continuing their education. These students hope to 'exit' their current situation due to their lack of resources, lack of income, or lack of job opportunities. They are 'withdrawing their relationship' with their current community/home country to try and prosper somewhere new.\n\nHirschman provides an example simplified here: Consider a publicly funded school where the quality of education declined. Quality-conscious parents would increasingly remove their child to a privately funded school, given that they are relatively indifferent to the cost. A price-conscious parent might notice that decline but lack the resources to make exit a viable option. At some point the school would know there was a problem, having had a number of students leave, but have no financial incentive to change, as the parents left who cared sufficiently about the quality to point to exactly where it had failed. The school remains locked into that state. Hirschman notes that in this and similar cases (\"connoisseur goods\"), a \"tight monopoly could be preferable\", preventing exit of quality-conscious consumers. A lack of exit would be better for the school, if not the child, by keeping an active voice among the parents.\n\nThe exit, voice, loyalty model can be used to explain relationships between nation states and their citizens. The model predicts that when citizens have a credible exit threat and states are dependent on their citizens, states are less likely to take actions that the citizens would object to. For the case of increased taxation by the state, examples of credible exit threats include having the economic resources to flee or the ability to easily evade taxes. States are said to be dependent on their citizens if they value citizen loyalty more than they value the benefits that would result from a policy change. When both of these criteria are met, the model would predict that the state would not pursue a policy that would encourage citizens to exit or to use voice.\n\nAdditionally, the choice between using voice and exiting depends on which method has the least amount of costs and most benefits. In the case of Africa in precolonial and early colonial times, citizens often chose to exit in response to unfavorable policy changes and this exiting took the form of emigrating away from a state. Even when citizens could use voice, exiting was a better option because there was a large amount of open land that could yield benefits that were similar to the benefits obtained by living within the state. However, in the last hundred years there has been a shift in strategy away from migration (exit) and towards protesting (voice) because it is no longer as easy to find open land to exit to.\n\nLoyalty is an essential force for Hirschman, shaping both voice and exit especially when it is difficult to join an organization. In the case of the newly-created Chinese middle class, which is mostly employed by the state, loyalty to the authoritarian government is very high. Their loyalty is bought through the difficulty in being admitted to their positions of relative financial prosperity and because emigration from China would result in losing significant status and income. These middle-class citizens are not completely voiceless, however, as they will protest the regime's choices through a process of remonstrations where they blame the failure of a policy on implementation by lower-level officials rather than criticize the policy directly. The regime is also aware that loyalty is bought at the price of financial stability; financial instability because of harmful policies would result in the same kinds of widespread protests that happened in 1989.\n\nHirschman postulated that contrary to the Hotelling–Downs analysis of political participation, those with \"nowhere else to go\" instead of being marginalized, their voices would become amplified. The rise of modern communications' amplifying effects has backed up Hirschman's position on voice, as seen by the rise of the Tea Party. When citizens can easily mobilize, the cost of mobilization is low for the citizens but the impact of using voice in a mobilized manner can lead to a large cost for the state.\n\nExit can be an effective strategy for gaining greater political voice in the case of public goods In the case of Married Women's Property Acts in the mid-19th century, US states and territories expanded property rights to women in order to attract more women to move to their states and territories. In the Northeast, women were needed in large numbers to work both in industry and as servants; the ability for women to retain control of their earned wages and enter into contracts was an additional pull to encourage women to change residences. Similarly, competition for women residents among US territories in what is now the Western United States put pressure on legislatures to pass laws that would attract and retain these women in order to secure the benefits of obtaining statehood.\n\nHirschman's exit, voice, and loyalty analytical framework has underpinned important research within employment relations. Hirschman's insights that exit and voice are often, but not always, mutually exclusive and that loyalty will moderate a consumer's chances of voicing any misgivings are useful in explaining the link between workplace policies and outcomes.\n\nThere are different forms of employee voice, including individual voice, such as employee surveys, and collective voice, typically unions, as well as combinations of them. Contrasting forms of voice have different degrees of power. An assumption that consumers have power underpins Hirschman's original framework. For instance, Hirschman argued that, in most instances, once consumers or 'customer-members' of an organization had voiced their concerns, decision makers within the selling organization could be expected to search for the sources of those misgivings and attempt to remedy the situation.\n\nIn comparison to competitive consumer markets, the employment relationship requires a different approach to power as managers have more authority than lower level employees, leading to important implications for how exit, voice, and loyalty are treated within the employment context. For instance, in sharp contrast to Hirschman's argument that, where exit is possible, voice is likely to be determined by 'the extent to which customer-members are willing to trade off the certainty of exit against the uncertainties of an improvement in a deteriorated product', within the context of employment, how willing employees are to trade off the uncertainties and costs of exit against the certainties of staying will strongly influence employees' decisions to quit as well as to voice their opinions. Similarly, loyalty and voice are not positively related in the employment context. In Hirschman's original formulation, consumers with higher levels of loyalty are more likely to voice their preferences to the selling organization rather than stop buying a product or service (exit). However, employees who voice their concerns may be seen as disloyal or as a disruptive influence by managers leading loyal employees to remain silent. For this and other reasons, a concept of 'neglect' needs to supplement Hirschman's exit, voice, and loyalty framework within the employment context.). Alternatively, 'toleration' is sometimes applied to situations in which employees remain with the organization, aware of problems, yet do not voice concern or grievance.\n\nAccording to Choi & Chung, some feel as though the competent wages given in teacher unions are responsible for fewer turnovers. Unions provide a platform for their employees to voice their concerns, and in turn, employees are able to voice how they feel rather than try to retreat from or 'exit' their union. The findings show, that the schools with greater policies for voicing concerns have lower rates of turnover. The article used a 2014 Bureau of Labor report to find that 2.5 million of teachers were covered by unions. With that number being so large, this information would be useful to those who want insight on how to keep their union workers happy. This information would also be useful for those looking for better grievance policies. According to Gunnarsdóttir, middle managers in welfare positions are feeling emotional tension in their duties from having to receive and enforce organizational change. This leaves them susceptible to having their loyalty doubted. Due to this they feel like they aren't able to 'voice' their concerns. They were able to execute strategies that evenly dispersed opposing outlooks while remaining autonomous during a radical change. O'Meara, Bennett & Neihaus discuss what might \"pull\" staff members away from their job, one example being better wages. They also discuss what might \"push\" them away from their job, one example being that they are unhappy with their current work circumstances. These faculty members are leaving for a number of reasons. Money and uncomfortable working circumstances are examples. Some might not be able to tolerate new leadership, or changes in the way they are expected to work. Saifullah & Shahida suggests that both professional respect and employer-employee relation influenced the employees' loyalty, but the effect of employer-employee was larger. Having a good relationship with employees has real reactions on their loyalty.\n\nAccording to Keith Dowding, Hirschman's book has been highly influential. Summarizing several criticisms of the book, Dowding writes that some scholars have argued that exit and voice can be used in unison (not solely as alternatives), that Hirschman does not pay attention to the ways in which collective action problems shape exit and voice choices, and that loyalty can also lead to \"silence\" rather than exit and voice.\n\nIn 2019, Professor Ian Shapiro of Yale University told a class of undergraduates, graduate students, and community members, \"if you read no other book in the social sciences before you graduate, this is certainly one of the two or three books you should definitely read.\" \n\n\n\n"}

He was a national cyclo-cross champion, an accomplished time triallist and superb climber. His ability earned him the nickname of \"Angel of the Mountains\" in the 1958 Tour de France, which he won with four stage victories. He also won the Giro d'Italia in 1956 and 1959. Gaul rode best in cold, wet weather. In later life he became a recluse<ref name=\"L'Equipe 06/12/2005\">L'Equipe, 06/12/2005 Cyclisme – Disparition – Décès de Charly Gaul </ref> and lost much of his memory.\n\nCharly Gaul was a fragile-looking man with a sad face and disproportionately short legs. He had \"a sad, timid look on his face, marked with an unfathomable melancholy [as though] an evil deity has forced him into a cursed profession amidst powerful, implacable riders,\" as one writer put it.\n\nGaul worked in a butcher's shop and as a slaughterman in an abattoir at Bettembourg before turning professional on 3 May 1953 for Terrot, at the age of 20. By then he had already won more than 60 races as an amateur having started racing in 1949. They included the Flêche du Sud and the Tour of the 12 Cantons. He won a stage up the climb of Grossglockner during the Tour of Austria when he was 17, setting a stage record. It was his first race outside Luxembourg.\n\nHis first professional race was the Critérium de la Polymultipliée, which he finished eighth. His first professional win was in 1953 in Luxembourg, in the national cyclo-cross championship. He came second the same year in the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré stage race. The following year he was second in the Luxembourg road championship (which he won six times), won a stage in the Dauphiné Libéré, and won a bronze medal in the 1954 world championship.\n\nGaul rode his first Tour de France in 1953, but abandoned on the sixth stage. He also started the 1954 Tour but again abandoned before the finish. He came to the 1955 Tour after winning the mountainous Tour de Sud Ouest and finishing third in the Tour of Luxembourg. He conceded a lot of time on the opening flat stages, not helped by being in a weak team. His fight back started in the Alps, where the first stage was from Thonon-les-Bains to Briançon. He attacked and dropped the Dutch climber, Jan Nolten. Crossing the col du Télégraphe he had five minutes on his chasers; by the top of the Galibier he had 14m 47s. By the finish he had moved from 37th to third. He was on his way to winning the next day as well when he crashed descending in the rain. He attacked again when the race reached the Pyrenees, winning stage 17 from (Toulouse to Saint-Gaudens) ahead of the eventual overall winner, Louison Bobet. He won the mountains competition and finished third in Paris.\n\nAfter a hard-fought victory in the 1956 Giro d'Italia (in which he took three stages – including an eight-minute victory in the Dolomites stage from Meran to Monte Bondone, near Trento), Gaul was almost half an hour down after six days' racing in the 1956 Tour de France, but he was confident he could close the gap in the mountains. He won the mountains prize again, and two more stages – a mountain individual time trial on stage three and stage 18 to Grenoble. But his efforts did little good; he finished 13th.\n\nGaul started the 1957 Tour, but abandoned after two days with no stage wins.\n\nGaul returned to the Tour in 1958. Third in that year's Giro, he started dominantly and won four stages, three of them time trials, including the ascent of Mont Ventoux. His time of 1h 2m 9s from the Bédoin side, which in those days was cobbled in the first kilometres and poorly surfaced to the summit, stood as a record until Jonathan Vaughters beat it 31 years later in the Dauphiné Libéré.\n\nOn the last day in the Alps, his manager, Jo Goldschmidt looked at the rain falling and woke Gaul with the words: \"Come on soldier... This is your day.\" Gaul woke delighted at the cold rain and angry at the memory of how he had been denied the Giro the previous year, when he was attacked as he stopped by the roadside (see below). A lot of riders took advantage of his halt but he most blamed Bobet, a man as refined and diffident as Gaul was coarse and brusque. His feelings for Bobet had turned to \"flaming hatred,\" said the historian Bill McGann. He sought out his tormentor before the stage started. The impact was all the greater because the two had barely spoken to each other since the Giro. \"You're ready, \"Monsieur\" Bobet?\", he asked, laying emphasis on the false politeness of the \"monsieur\". \"I'll give you a chance. I'll attack on the Luitel climb. I'll even tell you which hairpin. You want to win the Tour more than I do? Easy. I've told you what you need to know.\"\n\nThere was a prize of 100,00 francs at the top of the col de Lautaret in memory of the race's founder, Henri Desgrange. The Dutchman Piet van Est won it, with Bahamontes behind him. A small group broke clear on the descent and had eight minutes on the rest. Gaul began the chase and shed rider after rider, including the Spaniard, Salvador Botella, who held eighth place. Botella stopped, covered his head in his hands and wept. Teammates turned back to encourage him; he burst into tears again when he saw them and climbed into the race ambulance. Gaul and Bahamontes dropped the rest. At first the rest thought that Gaul had lost too much time earlier in the race to be a threat, that he was looking only at the best climber's prize. But on the climb to the col de Luitel Gaul dropped Bahamontes as well. He was within three minutes of the leaders at the top, with Bahamontes a minute behind. Gaul took the lead and moved ahead as the race progressed through \"a curtain of water, a deluge without an ark\", as \"L'Équipe\" described it. Michel Clare, reporting for the paper, said: \"I was on a motorbike and I had to stop at Granier for a hot grog. I was so cold that afterwards it was an hour before I could start writing.\" When he finally began his report in the press room at Aix-les-Bains, he wrote: \"I remember only a curtain of rain. A deluge without an Ark. The caravan dissolved from the moment it entered the sea of clouds that followed the pretty chalets of [the ski station of] Chamrousse. Now we know what it means to be 'soaked to the bone.' I thought of Jacques Anquetil, whose face was becoming more and more triangular and yellow. I thought of them all, the known and the unknown, sailors carried away by the flood and who tried desperately to avoid being shipwrecked. One man escaped from the storm. Charly Gaul. Finally, his time had come.\" Gaul crossed the line at the lake in Bourget-en-Aix in near darkness with a slight smile, 12m 20s ahead of the chasing group and 15 minutes ahead of the leader, Raphaël Géminiani.\n\nIt moved him to third place, and two days later Gaul got those 67 seconds and more in a time-trial on a difficult circuit at Châteaulin, riding at 44.2kmh. There he beat even Anquetil, who was suffering a lung infection after the rainy ride to Bourget-en-Aix.\n\nIn 1959, he was 12th. He lost time in the heat of the Pyrenees but won the stage to Grenoble again, with the eventual overall winner Bahamontes second.\n\nGaul missed the 1960 Tour. In 1961 he came third and won stage nine to Grenoble. He crashed in the Alps, on the descent of the Cucheron, bruising his hip, shoulder and knee. At the beginning of the final stage he was second to Anquetil. Guido Carlesi attacked as the Tour entered its final kilometre, overcoming a four-second deficit to Gaul. This moved him to second, relegating Gaul to third.\n\nIn 1962 he finished ninth with no stage victories. The 1962 Tour was contested by trade rather than national teams for the first time since 1929, and Gaul's was not one of the strongest. His final contested Tour was 1963, when he dropped out without winning any stages.\n\nGaul won the Giro d'Italia in 1956 and 1959. His victory in 1956 came after leaving the field in the climb of Monte Bondone at 1,300m, Snow fell and Gaul was alone with 88 km to go. It was so cold that he had to be carried off his bike at the finish and stopped on the way up for a drink.\n\nOn the stage victory to Courmayeur he took a 10-minute advantage over Anquetil on the final two climbs. Gaul lost the 1957 Giro after stopping for what was described in French papers as \"a natural need\" on the road to Trieste. His rivals, particularly Bobet and Gastone Nencini attacked. Gaul was upset at a breach of race etiquette and still more annoyed to find himself referred to as \"Monsieur Pi-Pi\", which in French rhymes with and means pee-pee. Gaul rounded on Bobet and said: \"I will get my revenge. I will kill you. Remember I was a butcher. I know how to use a knife.\" It was that that sparked the attack in the following year's Tour de France.\n\nIn the 1960 Giro he won a stage on his way to third place. In 1961 he finished fourth.\n\nGaul was national cyclo-cross champion at the start and the end of his time as a professional. He also came fifth in the world championships of 1956 and 1962. He won in Dippach in 1955, Kopstal, Colmar-Berg and Bettembourg in 1956, Schuttrange, Ettelbruck, Kopstal, Bissen and Colmar-Berg in 1957, Alzingen in 1958, Muhlenbach in 1960.\n\nGaul's career effectively ended with the Tour de France in 1962. \"Without knowing it, he was climbing the slope of his own decline,\" said Philippe Brunel; \"He grumbled as he climbed the Pyrenees and his eyes were flecked with blood.\" At Saint-Gaudens, after his faithful teammate and roommate Marcel Ernzer had dropped out, he spoke of his lassitude, saying \"I'm scared in the peloton... The abuse of stimulants, the fatigue [make riders] clumsy. How many of them have got the reflexes that they need?\" Gaul was never the same. At the end of the season, he left the Gazzola team, tried Peugeot (which came to nothing), a comeback (equally nothing) in the Lamote-Libertas team.\"\n\nGaul stopped for good after a track meeting at Niederkorn in 1965. He never recovered from the hurt of being whistled by the crowd when he made his last appearance on the road in the country, riding for a poor team, Lamote, sponsored by a Belgian brewery and achieving nothing. He ran a café at Bonnevoie near the railway station in Luxembourg city before slipping out of public view.\n\nGaul was 1.73 m tall and weighed 64 kg. His lightness was a gift in the mountains, where he won the climbers' competition in the Tour de France of 1955 and 1956. Unusual for a light man, he was also an accomplished time-trialist, in one Tour de France beating the world leader, Jacques Anquetil. Gaul pedalled fast on climbs, rarely changing his pace, infrequently getting out of the saddle. His contemporary, Raphaël Géminiani, said Gaul was \"a murderous climber, always the same sustained rhythm, a little machine with a lower gear than the rest, turning his legs at a speed that would break your heart, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.\" The journalist Pierre About wrote that Gaul had \"irresistible sprightliness [\"allegresse\"]\", that he had \"the air of an angel for which nothing is difficult.\"\n\nThe writer Jan Heine said: \"Nobody else ever climbed that fast. Gaul dominated the climbs of the late 1950s, spinning up the hills at amazing cadences, his legs a blur while his cherubic face hardly showed the strain of his exceptional performances.\" Pierre Chany called him \"without doubt, one of the three or four best climbers of all time.\" Philippe Brunel of the French newspaper, \"L'Équipe\", said: \"In the furnace of the 1950s, Gaul seemed to ride not against Bahamontes, Anquetil Adriessens, but against oppressive phantoms, to escape his modest origins, riding the ridges to new horizons, far from the life without surprises which would have been his had he stayed in Luxembourg.\" Gaul was weakest on flat stages and in the heat. In the 1957 Tour de France he went home after two days, stricken by the temperature in what Pierre Chany called a \"crematorium Tour\". He was at his best in cold and rain, winning the following year's race after a lone ride through the Alps in a day-long downpour described by the French newspaper, \"L'Équipe\" as \"diluvian\". It was the first time the Tour had been won by a pure climber. Gaul moved from 11th to first place. Jacques Goddet wrote in \"L'Équipe\": \"This day surpassed anything seen before in terms of pain, suffering and difficulty.\"\n\nGaul was a variable rider who could delight and disappoint, almost at random. He was talented in stage races but unremarkable in one-day events.\nGaul was taciturn and spoke rarely to anyone but a circle including Anglade, Roger Hassenforder, Nencini and Bahamontes. The writer Philippe Brunel described his reputation within cycling as \"notorious\" [\"sulfureuse\"]. \"His eloquence and assurance seemed reserved for the bike, and the bike alone,\" said Charlie Woods.\n\nGaul was popular with fans but not among his rivals. Roger St Pierre said: \"With his boyish good looks and Jack the Giantkiller style, Charly Gaul was loved by the fans. He had his friends, too – his faithful lieutenant Marcel Ernzer even rode an identical bike so that his master would not be uncomfortable if he had to borrow it after a crash or a puncture. But he was not always popular with his rivals, his unpredictable, schoolboyish temperament, his lazy riding on the flat and his sometimes insufferable ego winning him few allies in the bunch.\" Many of his problems, said the writer Jan Heine, appeared to have been caused by a hostile peloton, which often seemed to do anything to make Gaul lose. He rarely shared what he won with those who helped him, said René de Latour in \"Sporting Cyclist\". Brian Robinson rode with Gaul in a mixed team in the 1956 Tour de France. He said Gaul had no intention of discussing tactics or of sharing his prizes with the rest of the team in return for their help. When Robinson won £250 on the first day and became the team's best-placed rider, \"many of my friends in rival teams congratulated me on my effort [but] the least enthusiastic of all seemed Gaul. \" Similar events happened in other teams. Gaul rode in 1958 for a team largely of Dutchmen. They did nothing to help him in the wind on flat stages, said the French rider Henry Anglade, who knew Gaul well, who came from the same region and was one of the few French riders close to him. \"He wasn't helped to move up through the echelons, \" he said. Gaul in turn said the Dutch were \"too interested in their personal classification.\"\n\nGaul moved into a small hut in a forest in the Luxembourg Ardennes. There he wore the same clothes every day – patterned green trousers, studded walking boots and a sweater or jacket – and went walking with his dog, Pocki. He had a telephone but never answered it. He removed his name from the phone book. His rare excursions were to buy everyday goods and shopkeepers who met him spoke of a man who was ill and depressed, that he hadn't recovered from separating from his second wife. When journalists found him to ask more he confirmed he was distressed but declined, saying \"I'm sorry but it was all so long ago. Please leave me in peace. I'm just an old grumbler.\" He appeared now and then anonymously beside the road during the Tour de France, unrecognisable with a beard, straggling hair and a paunch.\n\nHis isolation lasted until 1983, the 25th anniversary of his victory in the Tour de France and the year he met his third wife, Josée. He moved with her into a house in the south-west suburbs of Luxembourg city. There he spoke to Pilo Fonck of the radio and television station, RTL. \"I was as happy as a kid,\" Fonck said. \"I had the interview of my life, the one that everybody wanted to have.\"\n\nGaul died of a lung infection two days before his 73rd birthday, following a fall in his house at Itzig. He left a wife, Josée, and daughter, Fabienne. \"VeloNews\" said: \"Gaul raced in a different era, and his like will never be seen again.\" A cyclo-sportive event is held each summer in Luxembourg in Gaul's memory, sometimes attended by his wife and daughter.\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Luxembourg recognised Gaul's past and his return to society by offering him a job as archivist at the sports ministry. There, said Philippe Brunel, \"he could go back into the past, put together day after day, scrupulously, the puzzle of his life, looking for why this need to escape from society.\"\n\nThe organisers of the Tour de France invited him in 1989 as their guest when the race started in Luxembourg. He made his first public appearance there, with his daughter, Fabienne. He received the Tour de France medal from the organiser, Jean-Marie Leblanc. He attended a reunion of former Tour winners when the centenary race was presented in October 2002. He began following cycling again, particularly Marco Pantani, the leading climber of the time. He was a guest at many races, including stages of the Tour. There he sat beside the rostrum and answered questions put by the commentator, Daniel Mangeas. William Fotheringham, writing in \"The Guardian\", said Gaul \"cut a curious figure – plump, shambling, confused – his eyes hidden behind thick spectacles above a wispy beard, a far cry from his heyday in the 1950s.\"\n\nGaul rode in an era before drug tests and drug rules. Pictures show that he frequently frothed at the mouth. Goddet spoke of his dribbling during his record ride up Mont Ventoux: \"Yes, it was without doubt the first time that I saw the soft and thin face of the Luxembourger, who never shows signs of suffering, running with the sweat of pain, the dribble of effort flooding his shaven chin and sticking to his chest in long dirty ropes.\"\n\nGaul rode best in the cold and poorly in the heat. His rival, Bahamontes, didn't name Gaul but said that the heat suited him best \"because then others couldn't take as much amphetamine.\" Marcel Ernzer, Gaul's domestique, recalled a conversation with Gaul:\n\nSource:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1871429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871429", "title": "Exeter Conspiracy", "text": "Exeter Conspiracy\n\nThe Exeter Conspiracy in 1538 was a supposed attempt to overthrow Henry VIII, who had taken control of the Church of England away from the Pope, and replace him with Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter, who was a first cousin of the King.\n\nAn Act of Attainder was brought against the Marquess of Exeter and he was found guilty of treason by his peers in Westminster Hall, along with other supposed conspirators. Some sources suggest the 'conspiracy' was largely exaggerated by Thomas Cromwell, at this point Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich. Victorian historian J. A. Froude, however, writes that the Courtenays were 'petty sovereigns in Devonshire and Cornwall', which may go some way to explaining the true nature of the conspiracy. Yet there is no evidence to suggest that Courtenay ever had the means to or intended to muster any kind of rebellion against the King, the charges brought against him were based on the correspondence he had with Reginald Pole, who was both a Catholic Cardinal and a possible Yorkist claimant to the English throne, and the testimony of Geoffrey Pole, Reginald's brother.\n\nThe king, with Reginald Pole himself out of his reach, took revenge on Pole's family for engaging in treason by word against the king. The leading family members and even Pole's mother, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, were executed, and all their properties seized. The action destroyed the Pole family. Sir Geoffrey Pole was arrested in August 1538; he had been corresponding with Reginald, and the investigation of Henry Courtenay, Marquess of Exeter (Henry VIII's first cousin and the Reginald Pole's second cousin) had turned up his name; he had appealed to Thomas Cromwell, who had him arrested and interrogated. Under interrogation, Sir Geoffrey said that Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu (his eldest brother), and Exeter had been parties to his correspondence with Reginald. Montagu, Exeter, Sir Edward Neville and Lady Salisbury were arrested in November 1538, together with Henry Pole and other family members, on charges of treason, although Cromwell had previously written that they had \"little offended save that he [Reginald Pole] is of their kin\". They were committed to the Tower of London.\n\nIn November 1538, Sir Edward Neville was executed for treason. In January 1539, Sir Geoffrey was pardoned, and Montagu and Exeter were tried and executed for treason, while Reginald Pole was attainted \"in absentia\". In May 1539, Montagu, Exeter, Lady Salisbury, and others were also attainted, as her father had been; this meant that they lost their lands – mostly in the South of England, conveniently located to assist any invasion – and titles, and those still alive in the Tower were also sentenced to death, so could be executed at the King's will. As part of the evidence given in support of the Bill of Attainder, Cromwell produced a tunic bearing the Five Wounds of Christ, symbolising Lady Salisbury's support of Roman Catholicism and the rule of Reginald and Mary; the supposed discovery, six months after her house and effects had been searched when she was arrested, is likely to be a fabrication.\n\nIn 1539, Sir Nicholas Carew, formerly something of a favourite of the king, fell out with him and was arrested and executed. At his trial it was alleged he had conspired for Exeter.\n\nMargaret Pole, as the Countess of Salisbury was now called, was held in the Tower of London for two and a half years under severe conditions; she, her grandson (Montagu's son), and Exeter's son were held together and supported by the King. In 1540, Cromwell himself fell from favour and was himself executed and attainted. Margaret Pole was finally executed in 1541 (her execution was dreadfully botched and horrifying even for those brutal times), protesting her innocence until the last – a highly publicised case which was considered a grave miscarriage of justice both at the time and later. Reginald Pole is known to have said that he would \"...never fear to call himself the son of a martyr\". Some 350 years later, in 1886, Margaret was beatified by Pope Leo XIII.\n\n\n"}

Rio Claro lies east of Princes Town, west of Mayaro and northwest of Guayaguayare. It serves as the major commercial centre for southeastern Trinidad. It lies in a primarily agricultural area. It is the seat of the Rio Claro–Mayaro Regional Corporation.\n\nThe town was named for a small stream, which was named \"Rio Claro\" by Spanish surveyors in the 1770s. A \"rest house\" was built there in 1850 when a road was cut from Mission (now Princes Town) to Mayaro. As cacao planters settled the area, the village on the banks of the Rio Claro came to be called by that name. When the Trinidad Government Railway extended its line to this village in 1914, the name Rio Claro was formalised.\n\nRio Claro currently has two secondary schools and 9 primary schools.\n\nThe area is well known for its extensive yet accessible forests. The early lumber industry (circa 1930's) left many small trails, some of which were eventually paved over. This infrastructure development enabled not only the local farming populace but many avid hunters and fishermen access to these areas. Well into the 21st century the area is known throughout Trinidad as having exceptionally fruitful hunting (small game animals such as agouti, lappe and armadillo) and fishing grounds.\n\nA large proportion of the area's residents still practice farming and hunting; however this is not a subsistence lifestyle by any means. The residents have incorporated many of the modern goods and cooking styles with the more traditional methods and ingredients, resulting in a unique array of dishes that is regularly eaten in homes everyday.\n\nGround provisions, freshwater fish and small game animals (commonly referred to as \"wild meat\") are dominant in the cuisine in this area. Navet, a village in the Rio Claro area is famous for its dasheen plantations. Poultry, canned and other preserved goods are accompaniments to these meals. Food in this area is generally prepared with generous use of spices, seasonings and pepper – great pride is taken in ensuring that all ingredients (where possible) are cleaned. Cooking itself is a family affair, a group activity that allows for bonding and strengthening of relationships. One must not overlook that some of the tastiest doubles were sold in Rio Claro and that these vendors have won national competitions.\n\nOverall this way of life, often viewed as being \"hard\" by outsiders, is what makes the residents in the area enjoy a slightly higher standard of living than other communities, as the food expenditure is less here than in other towns and villages.\n\nThe area's farms are well suited to grow a wide range of crops – the many small streams, ponds, hills and trails allow this to be possible. Crop rotation is still popular among many of the traditional cocoa, citrus, banana and coffee farmers although within the last ten years there has been a heavy investment in \"new\" crops such as various ground provisions (e.g.: yams, tubers, cassava), seasonings and fruits. A proportion of the harvest is sold within the southeastern corner of the island but a larger proportion is sold to export firms which export the produce to major West Indian centers in the North America.\n\nFor many years the Rio Claro area sustained a profitable trade in Caribbean tropical hardwoods. The area is rich in natural growths of hardwoods mahogany, cedar, appamatte, teak and mora – all of these are commercially harvested by the many small independent timberjacks in the area. Softer tropical timber is also harvested and sold to the many sawmills in the area (there are at least three fully operational mills) for use in the island's manufacturing and export industry.\n\nThe area is populated by many skilled carpenters and woodworkers who have learnt their trade from their forefathers. The result is some of the highest quality furniture, wood sculpting and displays of carpentry that can be found not only in Trinidad but in the Caribbean region.\n\nStarting from the early 1990s many of the stakeholders began a grassroots movement to conserve their forests (without governmental assistance). Harvested growths were replanted with new saplings (usually cedar, mahogany and teak) with the result that the industry is very much alive and strong in this part of the island.\n\nRio Claro is known for the many bars/rum-shops – an offshoot of having been one of the last towns before reaching the oil rich fields of Guayaguayare in the 1970s. There are more bars in this little town than in any other. In one square kilometer off the center of Rio Claro there are 26 bars, and all of them are patronized. Many of the older 'watering holes' have receded with its original owners. \n\nMany of the bars are integrated into the communities themselves. They act as meeting places for the strong village councils in the area as well as hosts for the many small club teams. Weekends usually see an eruption of various village cricket, football and card tournaments, often with major money prizes at stake.\n\nThe bars also function in the capacity of meeting areas during weddings, funerals and general holiday gatherings; indeed the high population density of these establishments makes them a convenient and affordable manner for local (and traditional) entertainment.\n\n"}

The council is also the principal body with responsibility for responding to complaints about Australian newspapers, magazines and associated digital outlets.\n\nRegulation of broadcast media in Australia is conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority.\n\nThe APC was only established after the Federal Government began preparation of legislation to create a government authority to ensure accountability in 1975.\n\nIn accordance with its constitution, the council pursues its goals by:\nThe council is funded by its publisher members in the newspaper and magazine industries. It relies on publishers and editors to respect the council's standards and decisions, to adhere voluntarily to standards of good practice and to publish adjudications the result from complaints made against them. It has no legal or legislative power to fine or penalise the press.\n\nThe council's standards of good media practice are contained in its Statements of Principles, Specific Standards and Advisory Guidelines. The standards are applied by the council when considering complaints and are used as the basis for statements by Council representatives about good media practice, whether addressing practitioners within the industry, journalism students or the broader community. The council also undertakes research and convenes conferences and seminars on aspects of media standards.\n\nThe council's Statement of General Principles was substantially revised in 2014.\n\nThe council's mandate to consider complaints extends to all print publications and related digital outlets, such as websites, of publishers which are \"constituent bodies\" of the council. These publications comprise about 90 percent of all print and online outlets in Australia representing some 850 mastheads.\n\nThe council also issues statements on policy matters within its areas of interest, including through submissions to parliamentary committees, commissions and other public bodies. It also undertakes research and convenes or participates in conferences and seminars on policy issues.\n\nThe Australian Press Council has 26 members, comprising:\nThe chair is chosen by the council and has always been a judge or a university professor. The public members and independent journalist members are appointed by the council on the nomination of the chair. The nominees of publishers are chosen by the media organisations which have agreed to support the council and be subject to its complaints system. It meets quarterly, usually in Sydney or elsewhere in Australia from time to time. It is headed on administrative and other matters by an Executive Director.\n\nThe current chair of the Press Council is Neville Stevens (effective 22 January 2018). The inaugural chairman was Sir Frank Kitto. He was followed by Geoffrey Sawer, Hal Wootten, David Flint, Dennis Pearce, Ken McKinnon, Julian Disney and David Weisbrot.\n\nIn 1979, during the run-up to the South Australian state election, the News Limited owned \"The News\" campaigned against the Australian Labor Party in South Australia. A successful complaint was heard in relation to which the News Limited representatives alleged contained irregular procedures, leading the News to withdraw from the council in 1980. News re-joined the Press Council in 1987, but, as the single most important source of funding, its relationship with the body has been fraught. [see Criticisms by News Corp, below]\n\nThe media union, now known as the Media Entertainment & Arts Alliance (MEAA), withdrew from the Press Council for nineteen years. It was not a member between 1986 and 2005.\n\nIn 2012, Seven West Media, publisher of \"The West Australian\", withdrew from the Press Council and set up its own complaints body, the Independent Media Council, to handle complaints against its print and publications and websites. The company cited its unwillingness to fund a substantially strengthened Press Council.\n\nThe council receives more than 700 complaints each year. About three-quarters of those which are fully pursued by the complainant result in a correction, apology or some other form of action being taken.\n\nWhere the complaint is resolved through a formal adjudication, the relevant publisher is required to publish the adjudication promptly and with due prominence.\n\nThe council has in the past been criticised for being unable to censure its members in anything more than a minor manner when standards are breached and for being a \"toothless tiger\" as a result of being funded by the publishers whose work it is meant to evaluate.\n\nThe chairman of Australian Consolidated Press, Kerry Packer described the council as \"\"window dressing\"\" at a 1991 parliamentary inquiry into the print media. A former chair of the council, Professor Dennis Pearce, told the Finkelstein Media Inquiry that the authority was overly influenced by concerns of losing its sponsors and that the industry was reluctant to fund its own watchdog.\n\nAnother former chairman, Ken McKinnon supported calls for the APC to have a stronger role and be better resourced, instead of statutory regulation. The Australian Greens Senator Bob Brown has described the APC as a \"\"hollow vessel\"\" and supports reform towards a statutory body with better funding.\n\nIn the wake of the Finkelstein Media Inquiry, publishers agreed on a major strengthening of the Press Council. Funding was raised from $0.8 million to $1.6 million in 2012-13 and $1.8 million in the following year.\n\nNews Corp Australia, Fairfax Media, the media union (MEAA) and the other publisher members of the council agreed to specific funding commitments for the three years, with subsequent commitments to be agreed at least two to three years in advance.\n\nUnder the new arrangements, publisher members are required to give four years’ notice of withdrawal from the council and will remain part of the council throughout that period. Their obligations to provide funding and comply with council processes became legally binding.\n\nThe then chair of the Press Council, Prof Julian Disney, said at that time:\n\n\"“The publishers’ commitments are very welcome and will greatly strengthen the Council’s resources and effectiveness. Now that continued membership and greatly-improved funding have been guaranteed for the next three years, the Council can implement a sustained program to fulfill its responsibilities across print and online media…. The package substantially addresses key concerns expressed by the Finkelstein Inquiry about the Council’s capacity to strengthen its independence and effectiveness.\"\"\n\nSince 2010, the Council has undergone a major transformation; doubling its budget, increasing its membership and staff, and moving to new premises in Sydney. As well as boosting its work on standards of practice, it has strengthened its processes for handling complaints and for ensuring that adjudications are prominently published by member organisations.\n\nA number of online-only publications have joined the Press Council, including Crikey, Mumbrella, and Ninemsn.\n\nIn August 2011, the APC released new Specific Standards on Coverage of Suicide. The standards stress the importance of the discussion of suicide in helping to improve public understanding of the causes and warning signs of suicide and act as a deterrent. However they say that reporting of methods should not be published, care must be taken not to spark “copycat” suicides, and details of suicide hotlines and helplines should be included in the relevant news reports.\n\nIn July 2014, the APC released new Specific Standards on Contacting Patients. The aim of these Standards is to facilitate media contact with people in hospitals and residential care facilities, while also ensuring respect for the health, dignity and privacy of those people and their families and for the general provision of care on the premises. In particular, the Standards aim to:\n\nIn March 2016, the APC released a new Advisory Guideline on Family and Domestic Violence Reporting. The Advisory Guideline is not intended to constrain or discourage news coverage or forthright debate about family violence. However, editors and journalists routinely exercise judgment about which events to cover; what information to collect and from whom; what material to include and what may be excluded in the interests of space and concision; and how to frame the story. The purpose of the Advisory Guideline is to help guide those considerations and consider the issues of safety, responsibilities, cultural sensitivities, context and content, and sources of assistance.\n\nBeginning in August 2014, \"The Australian\" newspaper, owned by News Corp Australia, published a series of more than 20 articles and editorials highly critical of the Press Council’s activities and leadership. The newspaper accused the Council of overstepping its mandate and issuing questionable adjudications.\n\nIn an editorial published on 9 August 2014, the newspaper said it had \"“lost confidence in APC chairman Julian Disney and deplores the direction in which he has taken the council”\".\n\nThe editorial continued:\n\n\"“The APC has become erratic in its rulings, unmoored from its foundations, ponderous and serpentine in its procedures, side-tracked by its chairman’s peculiar tastes and political predilections and ineffective as a body that promotes good practice.”\"\n\nIn a subsequent article in Crikey on 11 August 2014, David Salter, the former Executive Producer of the ABC TV Program Media Watch, noted that \"“The Australian has turned its particular brand of venom on Julian Disney, chair of the Press Council”.\"\n\nSalter wrote:\n\n\"“Self-regulation, at least in the ethical fantasyland of News Corp, is only a worthwhile system of media accountability so long as it doesn’t inquire into the abuse of a newspaper’s power to pursue vendettas and parade its own paranoia…. More importantly, this whole unpleasant episode demonstrates the hypocrisies that underpin the media self-regulation construct in Australia. In response to the perceived threats of the Finkelstein Inquiry and the Convergence Review, newspaper proprietors rushed to ‘strengthen’ the Press Council's authority and increase its funding.\"\n\n\"Now we have proof that this was all window dressing. If the APC's processes and findings don't suit a powerful member such as News Corp, it refuses to play by the rules and trashes the chair's reputation. Self-regulation is no regulation at all.”\"\n\nIn an interview on ABC Radio’s Media Report program, Julian Disney said: \"“There's always, over the years, been tensions way back to the start of the Council, not only with News Corp but with Fairfax from time to time. News pulled out only four years into the life of the Council, when the Chair was a High Court judge. So these tensions come and go, and I think they're felt more strongly in some parts of an organisation than others, and sometimes there are other pressures.”\"\n\nThe Press Council pointed out factual inaccuracies in \"The Australian's\" criticisms, and an alleged lack of balance and fairness in the series of attack articles. At a Council meeting on 28 August 2014, a resolution re-affirming support for Julian Disney was passed and made public. The resolution, passed by 19 votes to nil, with one abstention, read in part:\n\n\"“The Press Council reaffirms its confidence in the Chair and rejects the recent misrepresentations made by The Australian about the Chair and the Council. It also deplores the breach by The Australian of obligations of confidentiality during the Council’s complaint processes. The Council will continue to work with News Corp to resolve any legitimate concerns.”\"\n\nAfter taking over as chair in March 2015, Professor David Weisbrot spent much of his time meeting with member publishers, editors, leading journalists, officials of the MEAA, media and communications academics, and members of the NGOs, peak associations, and community groups with which the council regularly interacts.\n\nDuring his tenure as chair, the Press Council:\nIn a major address to the Melbourne Press Club on 6 August 2015, Professor Weisbrot stated:\n\n\"“Whatever benefits those procedural refinements may deliver, they are likely to pale in comparison with the benefits that will come from cultural change and a belief that the maintenance of high standards in the industry must be a shared enterprise.\"\n\n\"As I mentioned at the outset, for most of its history the Press Council has been perceived as the ‘watchdog’ or the ‘cop on the beat’ - in other words, its presence might tend to discourage poor journalistic practice by putting the fear of God into publishers and practitioners, giving the public an opportunity to bring complaints, and then whacking those unfortunate few whose alleged transgressions happened to be complained about.\"\n\n\"And publishers and journalists who pride themselves on their professionalism clearly do not relish the experience of having to publish a negative adjudication.\"\n\n\"But focusing on a particular breach of the Council’s Standards in the past and then publicising it probably channels too much energy, attention and resources on the aberrant cases - the roughly 40 cases in any particular year that go all the way from initial receipt to final adjudication.\"\n\n\"And since it’s such a relatively small number, most journalists, editors and publishers may feel that those aberrant cases have nothing to do with them.\"\n\n\"What we need to do instead is to create a different culture: one that is collegial and intelligent, that continually learns from experience….\"\n\n\"We urgently need to move away from the system of punishing individual transgressions in our industry and feeling that such action alone maintains high standards across the entire profession. While the need to identify and sanction poor practice will remain, there are much better strategies for achieving industry-wide improvement, and reassuring the community that this is the case.”\"\n\nProfessor Weisbrot resigned as chair effective 18 July 2017. The council's two vice-chairs, the John Doyle and Julie Kinross, took over the position jointly while a replacement for Professor Weisbrot was being recruited.\n\nThe Australian Press Council appointed Neville Stevens as its new chair effective 22 January 2018. Stevens has wide experience chairing panels and reviews in the private and public sectors and is a distinguished former public servant who headed two major Australian government departments, one of them dealing with telecommunications, media and broadcasting.\n\n"}

The office was not continued after Cromwell's execution in 1540. Cromwell's earlier appointment, that of Vicar General, had different responsibilities: under this title he directed the royal commissions into monastic affairs.\n\nPatih or \"Pepatih\" is a regent title equivalent to vicegerent which was traditionally used among Austronesian polities of insular Southeast Asia, in particular those of Java and the Malay world. In the first place it denoted the chief minister of a kingdom or (in the case of Java) a traditional regency. Lesser ministers could also be known by the title. In some cases the headmen of local communities could be termed Patih, for example on 16th-century Java and in Banjarmasin in southeastern Kalimantan.\n\nIn his capacity of chief minister in a realm, the Patih was the right hand and representative of the ruler. The commands of the ruler were transferred to the regional or local chiefs via the Patih. In the Javanese kingdoms the Patih had his own palace, the Pepatihan, and carried a particular name; in Yogyakarta his name as regent was Danurejo, in Surakarta (Solo) it was Joyonegoro.\n\n\n"}

Only two classes of the 2-6-6-6 type were built. One was the \"Allegheny\" class, built by the Lima Locomotive Works. The name comes from the locomotive's first service with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway beginning in 1941, where it was used to haul loaded coal trains over the Allegheny Mountains. The other was the \"Blue Ridge\" class for the Virginian Railway. These were some of the most powerful reciprocating steam locomotives ever built, at 7,500 HP (which was only exceeded by the PRR Q2), and one of the heaviest at 386 tons for the locomotive itself plus 215 tons for the loaded tender.\n\nOther equivalent classifications are:\nUIC classification: 1CC3 (also known as German classification and Italian classification)\nFrench classification: 130+033\nTurkish classification: 34+36\nSwiss classification: 3/4+3/6\n\nThe UIC classification is refined to (1'C)C3' for Mallet locomotives.\n\nTwo classes of 2-6-6-6 locomotives were built; the sixty H-8 \"Allegheny\" class locomotives for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) between 1941 and 1948, and the eight AG \"Blue Ridge\" class locomotives for the Virginian Railway in 1945. (The locomotives were Series AG on the Virginian, which was thought to be an abbreviation for Allegheny, but that referred to their being Articulated, Series G.) All were built by the Lima Locomotive Works. The \"Allegheny\" name refers to the C&O locomotives' job of hauling coal trains over the Allegheny Mountains. C&O-1601's power output is 7,500 hp.\n\nThough it was apparent to many knowledgeable people in the railroad industry that reciprocating piston driven steam locomotives might soon be replaced by diesel power, Lima and C&O set out to build the ultimate in high power steam locomotives and they succeeded. No diesel engine ever surpassed the output of these giants, which were among the heaviest steam locomotives ever constructed. The three-axle trailing truck supporting the firebox was unusual, carrying over 190,000 lbs, allowing the huge firebox needed for the high power. As it turned out, steam locomotives continued in service for almost another 20 years.\n\nGene Huddleston's book, \"C&O Power\", reports tests of the C&O with a dynamometer car indicating momentary readings of with readings between at about . The state of calibration of the dynamometer car is not known. The calculated starting tractive effort was only , but no one has published a higher dynamometer horsepower for any steam locomotive.\n\nThe locomotive was built to power coal trains on the 0.57% eastward climb from White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia to Alleghany, Virginia. With one at the front and another at the back, 11,500-ton coal trains left Hinton, WV and were at full throttle from White Sulphur Springs to the top of the grade at Alleghany. C&O's 2-6-6-6s also handled coal trains from West Virginia to Columbus, Ohio. Huddleston says that 23 locomotives were equipped with steam piping for heating passenger trains.\n\nMultiple unit operation in the diesel era removed the need to pack the highest horsepower in a single unit. The H-8's 80,000+ pound axle load demanded heavy rail and track structure.\n\nOne H-8, the 1642, suffered a crown sheet failure and subsequent boiler explosion at Hinton, WV in June, 1953. The force of the explosion rocketed the boiler endwise off the running gear, killing all three crew. While these locomotives had two sources of water for the boiler, a steam turbine pump-fed Worthington hot pump and one injector, it is not known whether any were defective at the time of dispatch. According to the family of the locomotive's engineer, Wilbur H. Anderson, of Hinton, previous crews had complained of a faulty water level gauge. Anderson's widow, Georgia Anderson, was given $10,000 in compensation by the C&O.\n\nThere are only two surviving Alleghenies. Upon retirement in 1956, 1601 was donated to The Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Michigan where it has been on display indoors since. 1604 was initially sent to C&O's scrap lines behind their diesel shops at Russell, Kentucky. It was then donated to the Virginia Museum of Transportation in Roanoke circa 1969 where it was displayed next to N&W 1218. On November 4th, 1985, it was partially damaged by a flood, which washed away the ground under it and nearly turned the locomotive over. In 1987, parent company Norfolk Southern did a cosmetic overhaul on it at their Roanoke Shops before it was sent to Baltimore to be displayed as the centerpiece of the then Mount Clare Junction shopping center which was adjacent to the B&O Railroad Museum. In 1989, the shopping center donated it to the museum, where it presently resides.\n\nThe 2-6-6-6 has inspired the creation of the animated character \"Sam\", who was recently added as a locomotive to the animated children's show, \"Thomas And Friends\".\n\n"}

It was provisionally adopted by a large group of key stakeholders in September 2003. These stakeholders include key government departments, including those responsible for labour, education, provincial and local government, water service, justice, policing, prosecution, social development, and education. The lead department is the Department of Labour. It was previously known as the Child Labour Action Programme, but was renamed in February 2006 because of the negative connotation attached to the abbreviation CLAP.\n\nThe first phase was from 2004 to March 2008 and referred to as the CLPA-1.\n\nMany departments and other stakeholders have been implementing aspects of the Child Labour Programme of Action since 2004. However, the Minister of Labour plans to submit it for formal cabinet approval only once a costing study has been done. This study aims at calculating the additional cost to government of key elements of this programme.\n\nIn September 2007 key stakeholders adopted the national plan for the second five-year-phase of implementation, April 2008 to March 2013. This is referred to as CLPA-2.\n\nThe programme \"Towards the Elimination of the worst forms of Child Labour\" (TECL) was, regarding its activities in South Africa during its first phase (2004–2008), essentially an executing agency for key elements of the Child Labour Programme of Action.\n\nThe South African Constitution provides that children under 18 have a right to be protected from work that is exploitative, hazardous, inappropriate for their age, detrimental to their schooling, or detrimental to their social, physical, mental, spiritual, or moral development. The term 'work' is not limited to work in economic activities (e.g. paid employment) but includes chores or household activities in the child's household (such as collecting wood and fuel), where such work is exploitative, hazardous, inappropriate for their age, or detrimental to their development. The term 'child labour' as used in the Child Labour Programme of Action covers all these forms of child work.\n\nThe labour department estimates that there were about one million of South Africa's children who are working as child labourers.\nSouth Africa has ratified the ILO Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (C138). This Convention requires ratifying states to pursue a national policy designed to ensure the effective abolition of child labour and to progressively raise the minimum age for admission to employment or work. South Africa also assisted in drafting the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (C182), which it ratified in 2000. In terms of this convention South Africa must take time-bound measures to eliminate the worst forms of child labour (WFCL). These include forms of bonded labour, commercial sexual exploitation of children, trafficking of children, and the use of children by others in illegal activities, including drug trafficking.\n\nSince 1996 the Government of South Africa has been involved in a process towards the formulation of appropriate policies and a national action programme to combat child labour. The Department of Labour is the lead department in the process. \n\nThe South African Government has a wide range of existing programmes that are directly and indirectly improving the situation of children. Many are aimed at addressing poverty, for example, the public works programmes, the provision of basic infrastructure, access to basic services and the roll out of social grants that benefit children. The programmes are funded for the most part from the government budget. The Child Labour Programme of Action is intended to complement and strengthen the existing programmes where they are not adequately preventing child labour.\n\nThe first step in the development of the South African programme was the establishment of a reliable and credible database on child work in the country. In 1999, Statistics South Africa conducted the first national household-based survey of child work in South Africa, the Survey of Activities of Young People (SAYP).\n\nIn addition to the SAYP, as part of the development of the Child Labour programme of Action, all known qualitative research conducted within South Africa on areas relevant to this policy was reviewed. This review was used, in particular, to inform those elements of the policy that deal with forms of work and employment that survey methodologies cannot address and was published as \"Discussion document towards a National Child Labour Action Programme\".\n\nThe SAYP and review of qualitative research confirmed that South Africa does not seem to have as serious a problem in regard to child labour as some other countries. In particular, the extent of child labour in the formal sectors of the economy is limited. However, the SAYP also confirmed that there indeed are children in the country who are doing unacceptable amounts of work, or work of an unacceptable nature. South Africa clearly needs to address these if it is to fulfill its commitment in terms of the Constitution and international conventions. Addressing the problems sooner rather than later should also help to avoid their multiplying and becoming more serious and difficult to address in the future.\n\nFollowing the process of gathering information, the Government of South Africa began formulating appropriate policies and a national action programme to combat child labour. This was done through a process of extensive consultation with the South African public and engagement with key stakeholders. Stakeholders consulted included government departments, organised labour, organised business and relevant non-governmental organisations (NGOs).\nThe consultation process included focus groups with affected children, who were asked about their experiences and subsequently asked for their opinion on proposed policy measures aimed at addressing their specific circumstances. Exercises were also conducted with children in grade seven in schools throughout the country. \n\nThe consultative process has culminated in the drafting of a national CLAP for South Africa.\nThe process of developing the Child Labour Programme of Action was overseen and guided by an inter-sectoral National Steering Committee involving key departments, employers' and workers organisations, NGOs and the community constituency of South Africa's NEDLAC (National Economic Development & Labour Council). The National Steering Committee was coordinated and chaired by the Department of Labour.\n\nThe following principles were applied in the drafting of the Child Labour Programme of Action:\n\nThe Child Labour Programme of Action identifies a wide range of activities falling within the mandates of a wide range of government departments and agencies. For each activity, the programme identifies the lead department as well as other departments and agencies, including non-governmental agencies, which would be involved. The views of the government agencies involved were canvassed during the formulation of the programme, and modifications introduced where necessary. Treasury's budget officers were also consulted to ensure that the proposals would mesh with budgetary plans.\n\nThe majority of the activities making up the Child Labour Programme of Action already forms part of government policy. In these cases the programme confirms that these activities contribute to addressing child labour. Where appropriate, it proposes that implementation be strengthened. In some cases, the programme suggests a variation of an existing programme or policy which will allow it to combat child labour more effectively. Neither of the above two types of proposals will involve significant expenditure or other resources from government.\n\nIn a few cases, the Child Labour Programme of Action proposes new activities, some of which will necessitate new expenditures. These are clearly identified in the programme document. For each activity – whether existing, a variation of existing, or new – the programme identifies whether once-off and ongoing costs will be minimal, moderate or significant. The Department of Labour will undertake a costing exercise regarding at least those items identified as being moderately or significantly costly.\n\n\nLarge-scale projects with significant financial demands and substantial human resource requirements have been avoided since they will not be realistic or sustainable. In a few cases, however, action steps have been included which may have significant cost implications. The most important of these is the proposed extension of the qualifying age for the Child Support Grant by 2006 from 13 years to the end of the school year the child turns 15 so as to avoid the current contradiction with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act prohibiting child work below that age, as well as the provisions on compulsory schooling. The programme also proposes a further roll out of the child support grant up to the age of 17 by 2008. This will encourage children to remain in school and so help to avoid children's engagement in hazardous works activities and other WFCL.\n\nThe Child Labour Programme of Action is called an Action Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour in the BLNS Countries.\n\nThe Child Labour Programme of Action document\n"}

Battisti attended the University of Florence, where he became a follower the Italian irredentism movement, aiming at the unification of his Trentino homeland with the Kingdom of Italy, though contrary to activists like Ettore Tolomei and Gabriele d'Annunzio he did not claim the predominantly German-speaking areas of South Tyrol up to the Brenner Pass.\n\nIn 1899, he married Ernesta Bittanti in a civil ceremony. The couple had three sons.\n\nA journalist by profession and a member of the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria, he was elected as a representative to the Tyrolean \"Landtag\" assembly at Innsbruck as well as to the Austrian Imperial Council (\"Reichsrat\") at Vienna in 1911, where he vainly tried to obtain a status of autonomy for the Trentino region. Disgruntled by Austro-Hungarian attitudes to minorities in their empire, Battisti agreed to construct a military guide for the Italians to Austrian provinces that bordered Italy. \n\nWhen Austria-Hungary mobilised in August 1914, Battisti fled with his family to the Kingdom of Italy, where he held public meetings demanding Italy join the Triple Entente forces against Austria. With Italy's entry into World War I following the 1915 London Pact, though still an Austrian citizen, Battisti fought against the Austro-Hungarian Army in the Alpini Corps at the Italian Front.\n\nAfter the Battle of Asiago, he was captured by the Austrian forces on 10 July 1916 and faced a court-martial in his hometown Trento at the Castello del Buonconsiglio, charged with high treason. Though Battisti officially enjoyed parliamentary immunity, he was sentenced to death by strangulation. He requested a military execution by firing squad so as to not dishonor the Italian Army uniform, but the judge denied his request and instead procured for him some shabby civilian clothes. Dressed in these, he was executed (hanged and garrotted) the same day, the brutality of which was increased by the fact that executioner botched the job so that Battisti actually was hanged twice. \n\nThe smiling execution squad posed with his body for photographs, which when later published did severe damage to Austria's reputation. The author Karl Kraus applied a picture as frontispiece of his 1922 play \"Die letzten Tage der Menschheit\" (The Last Days of Mankind). Battisti is considered a national hero in Italy and several memorials were dedicated to him in Rome as well as in his hometown Trento and at the Bolzano Victory Monument. Both Trento and Bolzano had been under Austrian control until 1918.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1993 to 1999 under the ring names Bart Gunn and Bodacious Bart, as well as his appearances with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) from 1998 to 2002 and with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) from 2002 to 2004 as Mike Barton.\n\nPolchlopek was trained to wrestle by Caesar Barraza, Blackjack Mulligan, Tim Parker and Boris Malenko. He made his debut in 1991.\n\nPolchlopek was perhaps most famous in the World Wrestling Federation as one-half of the tag team The Smoking Gunns with his kayfabe brother Billy Gunn. The team won the Tag Team Championship three times before breaking up and engaging in a brief feud in October 1996. Bart Gunn briefly went into solo competition, his most high-profile match occurring on \"Monday Night Raw\", in April 1996, which he lost to \"Ringmaster\" Steve Austin via the Million Dollar Dream.\n\nGunn feuded with Billy Gunn during the fall of 1996 which ended after he defeated Billy on the December 16th episode of Monday Night Raw. His most notable victory was scoring an upset victory over Triple H by disqualification on Superstars. He also participated in the 1997 Royal Rumble match. Gunn would later become a jobber in 1997 losing to the likes of Ron Simmons, Triple H, Ahmed Johnson and Vader. He disappeared from the roster that June. \n\nGunn would then have a brief stint in Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling where he won their championship from Lance Diamond on May 3, 1997. Then he would drop the title to Ace Darling on September 26.\n\nUnder his new manager Jim Cornette, Polchlopek recreated the Midnight Express tag team as \"Bodacious Bart\" with partner Bombastic Bob. The team had limited success, though they did hold the NWA World Tag Team Championship for a brief period in 1998.\n\nIn 1998, Bart Gunn participated in the WWF's shootfight tournament, the Brawl for All. Gunn faced tag partner Bob Holly in the first round, and was declared the winner on points. Gunn next defeated \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams, with a surprising knockout. He defeated The Godfather in the semi-finals, and Bradshaw in the finals to win the tournament.\n\nAfterward, Gunn briefly feuded with both Holly and Williams, both angry at having been beaten in the tournament, the latter masking himself and pushing Gunn off a stage. According to his interview in the Dark Side of the Ring episode on Brawl For All, he sat home for months following this after being told by Vince Russo that creative had nothing for him at the time. Eventually WWE sent him to a boxing school to train for a WrestleMania match against Eric \"Butterbean\" Esch. At WrestleMania XV, Esch knocked out Gunn in 35 seconds. Polchlopek was soon after released by WWF.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF, Polchlopek found success wrestling in Japan (due in part to his knockout of Steve Williams, who long held a strong reputation for his toughness in Japan). He debuted for All Japan Pro Wrestling in late 1998, competing in the 1998 World Strongest Tag Determination League, teaming with Johnny Ace, and finishing in 4th place with 8 points. He became a member of Johnny Ace's gaijin (foreign wrestlers) stable, The Movement, and the two continued to team. On June 9, they defeated Kenta Kobashi and Jun Akiyama to win the World Tag Team Championship. They held the title for a month and a half, before losing to No Fear on July 23. Following the title loss, Polchlopek stopped using the Bart Gunn name and became known as Mike Barton. In late 1999, Barton and Ace took part in the 1999 World's Strongest Tag Determination League, finishing in 5th place with 9 points.\n\nIn the spring of 2000, Barton entered the Champion Carnival, defeating Masao Inoue in the first round but losing to Takao Omori in the second. On June 9, Barton and Ace took part in a tournament for the vacant World Tag Team Championship, and lost in the first round to the eventual tournament winners, The Holy Demon Army. In the summer of 2000, Mitsuharu Misawa left All Japan to form Pro Wrestling Noah, taking most of the native talent with him. Barton, like many of the gaijin, remained in All Japan. Johnny Ace, however, left All Japan during the split and retired from wrestling, taking an office job in WCW and later the WWF.\n\nFollowing the NOAH exodus, Barton formed a new tag team with Jim Steele. In October 2000, Barton entered a tournament for the vacant Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, losing in the first round to Genichiro Tenryu. In November, Barton and Steele entered the 2000 World's Strongest Tag Determination League, finishing in 4th place with 10 points.\n\nOn January 2, 2001, Barton won the annual January 2 Korakuen Hall Battle Royal. In the spring, Barton entered the 2001 Champion Carnival, placing 5th with 13 points. By the end of 2001, Barton had begun making appearances in New Japan Pro Wrestling as a member of the All Japan branch of Team 2000. In November 2001, Barton and Steele entered the 2001 G1 Tag League and made it to the finals, where they lost to Tencozy.\n\nIn the spring of 2002, Barton entered the 2002 Champion Carnival, making it to the finals but losing to Keiji Mutoh. On July 20, Barton and Steele won The Stan Hansen Cup Four Way against The Varsity Club, KroniK, and George Hines & Johnny Smith. On August 30, Barton and Steele challenged Kronik for the World Tag Team Championship, but lost. In the fall, Barton and Steele left All Japan.\n\nPolchlopek had a short stint in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in 2003 only lasting a month where he wrestled one match where he lost to Perry Saturn.\n\nAfter leaving All Japan, Barton and Steele signed with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). Barton entered the 2002 New Japan Triathlon Series in November, teaming with Steele and Yuji Nagata. The team made it to the finals, but lost to Manabu Nakanishi, Osamu Nishimura and Yutaka Yoshie. In February 2003, Barton and Steele entered a #1 Contenders tournament for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. They ultimately emerged victorious, defeating Makai Club members Tadao Yasuda and Kazunari Murakami in the finals, but an injury to Steele prevented them from getting the title match. After Steele recovered, he and Barton returned to teaming. In October 2003, they entered the 2003 G1 Tag League. During the tournament, on October 21, the two received a shot at the IWGP Tag Team Title against champions Hiroshi Tanahashi and Yutaka Yoshie, but came up short. Barton and Steele finished the tournament in 5th place with 6 points.\n\nOn September 15, 2006, Barton had his debut match in Muga World Pro Wrestling, which was a victory over Tatsutoshi Goto, then had another 4 matches in the company. His last match in the company was a victory over Katsushi Takemura on September 25, 2006. Afterwards Barton left the company.\n\nOn December 10, 2007, Polchlopek returned to World Wrestling Entertainment as Bart Gunn, for the 15th Anniversary Battle Royal, but was eliminated from the match by Steve Blackman. Afterwards Michael Polchlopek retired from professional wrestling.\n\nPolchlopek made his mixed martial arts debut on June 17, 2006, defeating Wesley \"Cabbage\" Correira at \"Rumble On The Rock: Beatdown\" in less than two minutes by technical knockout on the basis of a cut suffered by Correira. In his second and final fight, on November 5, 2006, he faced Ikuhisa \"The Punk\" Minowa at PRIDE Bushido 13, losing via unanimous decision.\n\nPolchlopek was previously an electrician until 1993, and resumed work as an electrician 15 years later. He is a grandfather.\n\n\n"}

Their color is dark brown to black with black-and-yellow undersides, with yellow eyes, and the upper parts of the head and back are speckled with ivory or yellowish spots. The wings are transparent with reddish veins.\n\nThey have piercing, sucking mouthparts and rows of fine spines on their hind legs.\n\nIt is native to North America (northeastern Mexico), but it was accidentally introduced into Southern California in the early 1990s, probably with ornamental or agricultural stock. There it has become an agricultural pest especially to viticulture.\n\nGlassy-winged sharpshooters usually lay a mass of eggs on the underside of leaves, and they cover them with powdery white protective secretions kept in dry form (called \"brochosomes\") on the wings. After the nymphs hatch, the remaining egg mass leaves a brown mark on the leaf's surface. The nymphs feed within the vascular system of the small stems on the plant where the eggs were deposited. After several molts, the nymphs become adult glassy-winged sharpshooters.\n\nThe glassy-winged sharpshooter feeds on a wide variety of plants. Scientists estimate the host plants for this sharpshooter include over 70 different plant species. Among the hosts are grapes, citrus trees, almonds, stone fruit, and oleanders. Because of the large number of hosts, glassy-winged sharpshooter populations are able to flourish in both agricultural and urban areas. They feed on a plant by inserting their needle-like mouth parts into the plant's xylem. While feeding, sharpshooters squirt small droplets of waste from the anus (filtered xylem fluid, basically water with trace solutes, especially carbohydrates), often called \"leafhopper rain.\" These droplets are messy and, when the water evaporates, leave a residue that gives plants and fruit a whitewashed appearance.\n\nTheir feeding method, along with their voracious appetite for so many different hosts, makes glassy-winged sharpshooters an effective vector for the \"Xylella fastidiosa\" bacterium. Once the sharpshooter feeds on an infected plant, \"X. fastidiosa\" colonizes it by forming a biofilm on its mouth-parts. The sharpshooter then transmits the disease to additional plants while feeding. A plant that is not affected by any of the diseases caused by \"X. fastidiosa\" becomes a reservoir, holding the bacterium for other sharpshooters to pick up and carry to other plants. \"X. fastidiosa\" is linked to many plant diseases, including phoney peach disease in the southern United States, oleander leaf scorch and Pierce's disease in California, and citrus X disease in Brazil.\n\nSuccessful efforts using integrated pest management (IPM) of the glassy-winged sharpshooter include the use of insecticides, parasitoids (especially wasps in the family Mymaridae), and the impact of naturally occurring pathogens like viruses, bacteria, and fungi. \n\nOne of the newly discovered pathogens is a virus specific to sharpshooters. The leafhopper-infecting virus, \"Homalodisca coagulata virus-1\" (HoCV-1, \"Dicistroviridae\"), has been shown to increase leafhopper mortality. The virus occurs in nature and is spread most readily at high population densities through contact among infected individuals, contact with virus-contaminated surfaces, and/or as an aerosol in leafhopper excreta.\n\nOne of the most successful biocontrol efforts has been the mass rearing and release of four different leafhopper parasitoids (in the mymarid genus \"Gonatocerus\"), which have been very successful in reducing the number of eggs that survive. \n\nThe traditional means of insect management, such as scouting and land owner reports of leafhopper presence, followed by highly focused insecticide treatments, have also been of great value in reducing leafhopper numbers; all of these impacts have produced a system wherein reasonable, environmentally sound management of this insect pest is being maintained.\n\n\n"}

Historians agree that the settlers' success at these two battles signaled the turning of the tide of the Revolutionary War—in favor of the Americans.\nMartin was born in Caroline County, Virginia, and later lived at Albemarle County and then at Henry County, Virginia, at his plantation, \"Belmont\", on Leatherwood Creek in Martinsville, not far from the plantation of his friend Governor Patrick Henry, \"Leatherwood Plantation\".\n\nGeneral Martin held many positions during his public life. As a very young man he first tried his hand at farming, next he worked for three years as an overseer on the huge plantation of his local Virginia kin, next he was a longhunter, and an explorer on the frontier for friend Patrick Henry, then an early pioneer and builder of Martin's Station in the \"wild west,\" a surveyor of the KY/NC and TN/VA borders, an Indian agent/Indian fighter for Patrick Henry, a member at peace treaties with the Indians, and along with Dr. Thomas Walker, Joseph Martin named the Cumberland region and the Cumberland River, he served as a member of the legislatures of Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina, he was lifelong friends with Gen. Thomas Sumter, he was also friends and brothers-in-law with Col. Benjamin Cleveland (both married Graves sisters), he was unsuccessfully nominated by Patrick Henry to the position of the first governor of the Southwest Territory, was the holder of some 80,000 acres across the Southeastern U.S. at one point. The city of Martinsville, Virginia, was named in his honor during his lifetime.\n\nThe son of planter Capt. Joseph Martin Sr. and his wife Susannah Chiles, great-granddaughter of Colonel John Page, Joseph Martin Jr. was raised in a Virginia gentry family in Caroline and Albemarle Counties. His father, Joseph Martin Sr., was the son of wealthy British merchant William Martin in Bristol, England, who sent his son to Virginia as supercargo aboard his ship the \"Brice\". Martin Sr. wrote to his English father that he planned to marry the daughter of a common Virginia colonist. Even though she was from the Chiles family and was a descendant of Virginia's Col. John Page, to Martin's wealthy father back in England all American colonists were inferior to the English. William Martin of Bristol was himself Lord Mayor of Bristol and owner of a ship building company, a glass manufacturing plant, importer and exporter with the new world; including tobacco. The father wrote back disinheriting young Joseph Martin Sr., who never returned to England.\n\nJoseph Martin Sr. was \"a perfect Englishman\", recalled his grandson later, \"large and athletic; bold, daring, self-willed and supercilious. And in him was depicted, as my father has told me, the most complete form of the aristocracy of the British government.\" Capt. Martin arrived in Albemarle County in 1745, one of the original patentees. Joseph Martin Sr. left some 300 acres of his landholdings to son Joseph Jr. at his death in 1762. Nearby neighbors Dr. Thomas Walker, Peter Jefferson, James Madison, and the Lewis and Clark clans and kin including Lewis, Carr, Waller, Dabney, Hammock, Hughes, etc.\n\nBut Joseph Martin Jr., the son of the English immigrant, was not cut out for a Virginia gentry planter's life. \"Gambling was a favorite pastime.\" Martin's son, Revolutionary War officer Col. William Martin, in his accounts of his father's life in the, \"Lyman Draper Manuscript Collection,\" writes that although his father gambled, he was not much of a drinker and let his son in on his secret; Martin sometimes pretended to over-drink so he might appear to be drunk in order that fellow gamblers would let down their guard. As a youth, Joseph Martin ran off from an apprenticeship during the French and Indian War of 1756, and joined the army at Fort Pitt, where he served alongside another Virginia youth, Thomas Sumter. Following his early army service, Martin lit out for the rigors of the frontier, where he dressed in buckskin and was an early real estate speculator, trapper and fur trader and Indian fighter.\nBut this time on the frontier was after Martin had bought a large plot of land in Henry County with his earnings working for three years as an overseer for an uncle. Martin also gained 20,000 acres of land from Patrick Henry in a surveying contest at Powell Valley. Martin's youthful adventures on the frontier were grist for later stories... some of which were written by Martin's political foes and were slanted to paint a picture of him in an unkind light. One writer, a fan of Martin's political enemy, called him lazy and refused to describe him by his military ranking. General Joseph Martin may have been many things in his lifetime, but a quick study of his history and his accomplishments show that he was far from lazy. Eventually the soldiering, trapping and Indian fighting transformed the young Martin into a fearsome explorer.\n\nAmong Martin's earliest excursions on the frontier was one made on behalf of family friend Dr. Thomas Walker. Martin's son, Revolutionary War officer Col. William Martin, describes the naming of the area and the river in a letter to historian Lyman Draper, \"A treaty with the Cherokees was held at Fort Chiswell, Virginia on New River, then a frontier. On the return of the chiefs home, Dr.[Thomas] Walker, a gentleman of distinction, and my father, [General] Joseph Martin, accompanied them. The Indians being guides, they passed through the place now called Cumberland Gap, where they discovered a fine spring. They still had a little rum remaining, and they drank to the health of the Duke of Cumberland. This gave rise to the name of Cumberland Mountain and Cumberland River.\"\n\nIn 1769, Martin journeyed to Powell's Valley to attempt a settlement, a full ahead of any previous settlement. Martin and his party – which included his brother Brice and Mordecai Hord – had hoped to secure the granted to Dr. Walker and themselves. Martin's Creek in the region where Joseph Martin attempted his settlement is today named for him. (Martin's Station, as the settlement was known, became a well-known stopover for westward-bound settlers for many years.) The settlement ultimately failed, which some historians have blamed on the inability of the Loyal Company to defend its title to the tract.\n\nBut in the foray to Powell's Valley, Martin had established his credentials as a hard-bitten explorer. Daniel Boone and his party of explorers were stunned in 1769 when, upon their arrival in Powell's Valley, they discovered that Martin and his 20-man party had beaten them there. It was beyond the farthest reaches that Boone and his long hunters had explored. Following Martin's feat, the Albemarle County native became a force to be reckoned with in exploration circles, even though Martin's settlement was soon broken up by the Cherokees, who pushed back against the westernmost settlement yet attempted.\n\nBy 1775, when North Carolina merchant Richard Henderson purchased an immense tract of land from the Cherokees to found the short-lived Transylvania colony, in what is today Kentucky, Henderson turned to Martin as his agent in Powell's Valley. It was one of several such roles that the explorer, accustomed to trapping, longhunting and traveling in the Appalachian wilderness inhabited by the Cherokee, would hold over the years.\n\nMartin's Station stood along the Wilderness Trail near Rose Hill, Virginia. The first fort was built in 1769, but Martin's party were attacked by the local Native Americans. He returned a few years later in 1775 and built a new \"Martin's station\". Again he was attacked by the Indians and had to leave. Moving closer to the Cumberland Gap, he built another new \"Martin's Station\", his third, in 1783. The small fort provided protection plus supplies for hunters and immigrant families moving into Kentucky. He was able to finally sell his fort and lands in Powell County, Kentucky in 1788, and moved back to the town in Henry County, Virginia, that would soon be renamed in his honor: Martinsville.\n\nA \"fourth\" Martin's station was recently constructed at the Wilderness Road State Park. \"Builders of the hand hewn log replica, constructed in 2002, used only the kinds of tools that Martin would have used in the wild frontier in the later 1700s. Workers carted logs into the construction site with oxen and then used ropes and horses to set those logs in place. At times, reenactors came on the scene and made the construction yet authentic by staging spontaneous Indian attacks.\"\n\n\"Martin was a robust figure in the history of the early frontier,\" according to the WPA guide to the Old Dominion. \"He was born in Albemarle County in 1740, ran away to fight Indians at 17, became an Indian agent, land agent, and officer of militia, fighting Indians all up and down the frontier. In 1774 he came to Henry County, established himself at Belle Monte on Leatherwood Creek, for nine years sat for his district in the general assembly, and in 1793 was made a brigadier general of state militia. He was a brawny, picturesque man, more than six feet tall and the father of 18 children; wore buckled knee breeches and a great beard, braided and thrust inside his shirt.\"\n\nMartin first married Sarah Lucas in Orange County, Virginia. After her death in Henry County, Martin married Susannah\nGraves, a descendant of Captain Thomas Graves. Susannah Graves, of Spotsylvania County, Virginia, the wife of Joseph Martin, and her second cousin Mary Graves, who was married to Benjamin Cleveland, Susannah Graves was the daughter of William Graves and Mary unk, Mary was the daughter of Joseph Graves and Sarah Bunyard. Both are direct descendants of Thomas Graves and Anna Davenport, common ancestor, is Capt. Thomas Graves. [Ref; Wills of Joseph Graves and Thomas Graves]. \nWhile married to Sarah Lucas and then to Susannah Graves, Martin was simultaneously married to his half-Cherokee wife, Elizabeth Ward, the daughter of Nancy Ward, a power within the Cherokee tribes, and her husband, English trapper Bryan Ward. The polygamous relationship, justified by Martin as common practice among frontiersmen operating among the tribes, caused considerable consternation to General Martin's son, Col. William Martin. Joseph Martin and Betsy Ward had two children. (Joseph Martin's son by his Cherokee wife was educated in Virginia schools, but afterwards elected to return to the Cherokee.)\n\nOn November 3, 1777, Martin was commissioned by Governor Patrick Henry as Agent and Superintendent for Indian Affairs for the State of Virginia. (Martin served in the same capacity with the state of North Carolina from 1783 to 1789.) Gov. Henry instructed Martin that he was \"to reside at some place in that Nation in order to negotiate and direct all things relating to the Commonwealth and which concern the interest thereof, using your best endeavors from time to time to preserve peace with that Nation and to cultivate their present good Disposition.\" It was an appointment Martin would continue to hold until 1789.\n\nDuring his time on the frontier, Martin became acquainted at an early age with two other Revolutionary War patriots and frontiersmen: Benjamin Cleveland, who was his brother-in-law, [They were not related, just lifetime friends. Susannah Graves, the wife of Joseph Martin and Mary Graves the wife of Benjamin Cleveland were second cousins, common ancestor Capt. Thomas Graves. <\\ref> Wills of Joseph Graves, Thomas Graves and Benjamin Graves. Grace S. Green] Cleveland having married the sister of Susannah Graves; and Thomas Sumter, who had been a companion of Martin's during his early adventures on the frontier. Both men were fellow Virginia natives who struck out for the wilds, and both were ardent patriots.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War it was the efforts of Joseph Martin (then a Major) that helped prevent the Overhill Cherokee from launching widespread attacks on American colonists, which Loyalist agents had attempted to incite. Following the British capture of Savannah and Augusta, Georgia in 1778–1779, English goods made their way to the Cherokee on the Savannah River, prompting some tribesmen to rejoin the English cause.\n\nMartin's diplomacy with the Cherokees in 1780–81, wrote the American Historical Association, enabled the Continental Army to achieve victory over the English at the Battle of Kings Mountain, thus hastening the end of the conflict. On the eve of the Battle of Guilford Court House, in February 1781, General Nathanael Greene wrote Martin and seven other officers – including John Sevier, Arthur Campbell, and William Christian – appointing them agents to treat with the Cherokees and Chicasaws \"to afford the Said Tribes of Indians every mark of our good disposition towards them.\" Foremost in Greene's thinking, apparently, was keeping the Indians on the sidelines as the Continental Army and its militia forces fought the British in the last days of the war. Greene was probably mindful of previous British attempts at sending large quantities of ammunition, weapons, horses, cash and goods to their Indian allies through their Florida redoubts.\n\nAt the same time – and complicating Martin's legacy – Martin and his sons were prime movers behind the settlement of Tennessee by removing obdurate Cherokees from the territory.\n\nBy the end of the Revolution, Martin's place as chief colonial Indian agent seemed secure. In January 1780, Virginia governor Thomas Jefferson directed Martin to negotiate with the Cherokees to secure land around a new fort being overseen by General George Rogers Clark at the mouth of the Ohio River (Fort Jefferson). In the fall of 1783, the State of Virginia built a new fort at the Cumberland Gap, replacing an older fort which was adjudged to lie within the boundaries of North Carolina. The new Virginia fort was designed as the primary residence for Martin while he was in the region on official business. And in 1784, Thomas Jefferson directed Martin to use his connections with the Cherokees to negotiate for more land between the Carolinas and the Mississippi to establish American sovereignty over the region.\n\nLater, in a twist overlooked by most historians, Martin corresponded with Alexander McGillivray, the leader of the Creek Indians, who had Loyalist sentiments. In 1788 a letter from Martin to McGillivray was intercepted in which Martin professed to be interested in settling abroad. When the letter was discovered, the North Carolina General Assembly launched an investigation into Martin's conduct. But he was later exonerated when it turned out that he was acting as a spy on Patrick Henry's instructions to ferret out the nature of McGillivray's ties to the Spanish, who were then active in Florida.\n\n\"General Martin's conduct so far as I could discern in that affair was really praise-worthy,\" Henry wrote to United States Senator from Virginia Richard Henry Lee. \"He [Martin] frequently gave me Intelligence of Creek Indian affairs, and of the intercourse between other Indians and the Spaniards that was interesting.\n\nGeneral Martin and Governor Patrick Henry kept a long-running correspondence through the years, some of which concerned real estate speculation. Other letters recounted Martin's dealings with the Indian tribes, as well as settlement efforts in Tennessee. As late as 1790, Patrick Henry wrote Joseph Martin concerning a real estate investment, holding out that the hope, Henry noted, that Martin might finally capitalize on his long service to Virginia. \"After all the Hazards you have run,\" Henry wrote, \"that you have not acquired so much property as many others would have done in your situation, I was desirous to throw something in your way by which some fine lands would have been offered to you in our purchase.\" \n\nUltimately, General Martin lost his appointment as chief Indian agent. Martin's \"manner of treating with the Indians necessarily prevented his appointment,\" Senator Richard Henry Lee informed Patrick Henry in September 1789. \"At present no such office as a standing Indian agent is appointed. The Government of the Western Territory is charged with such affairs.\"\n\nIn some quarters Martin was seen as too lenient with the Indians, especially after an incident in 1786 when several young Cherokee warriors were said to have murdered two white settlers near Clinch Mountain. The killings set off calls for retribution within the secessionist State of Franklin, and Martin found himself trying to mediate the dispute, and calm the settlers, while trying to prevent the angry Cherokees from joining with the Creeks. Martin did little to disguise his contempt for the authorities of the State of Franklin, who, Martin wrote Henry, \"immediately marched into the above mentioned Town, where they killed one Young [Indian] woman, and Shot Several others.\"\n\nBut Martin himself had not hesitated to wield military power against the Cherokees, especially when they killed several colonists at the instigation of Loyalist and English agents during the Revolution. In 1781, following a running battle between Indian forces and those of the colonists, Colonel Arthur Campbell, Lieutenant Colonel John Sevier and Martin addressed a letter to the Indian chiefs, warning them about their actions. \"You know you began the war,\" the bulletin began, \"by listening to the bad councils of the King of England and the falsehoods told you by his agents.\" Further hostilities, the three colonial leaders warned, would result in a military campaign against the Indian villages. Seven years later, in 1788, Martin again fought the Overmountain Cherokee, as well as the Chickamauga Cherokee, in a battle at Lookout Mountain, during the Cherokee–American wars.\n\nBut having eventually struck a hard-won peace with the tribes, Martin bridled at the actions of the State of Franklin. Henry empathized with Martin, writing the General in May 1785 that \"the disorderly behavior of the Franklin people, as they call themselves, gives me concern. If they will not be subservient to the Rules and Regulations respecting Indian affairs, which prevail in all the States, they must expect none of the advantages of the Union.\"\n\n\"Partisans of the State in N[orth] Carolina afterwards found him obnoxious to their views,\" former Governor Henry wrote Virginia Senator William Grayson in urging Martin's reappointment in 1789, \"and as I believe often endangered his Life For his duty called him to discourage their Disorderly conduct [and] thwart their favorite Schemes.\" Henry then commended Martin for his efforts to impose restraints upon the actions of the State of Franklin settlers, whose \"frequent Butcherys of Indians & Refinement in cruelty sufficiently characterize these people who are Mr Martins decided Foes.\"\nMartin's attempts to restrain the State of Franklin settlers from a more-belligerent course made Martin unacceptable in some quarters, where he was seen as too 'soft' on the tribesmen. Martin also became controversial in some quarters after the Treaty of Hopewell in 1785, when Martin, Andrew Pickens and Benjamin Hawkins, acting as government agents, concluded treaties with the Cherokees and the Choctaws. The Cherokee treaty particularly engendered later enmity from the Indian signatories, as well as the colonial state governments. The Indians saw the treaty as a thinly-veiled land grab, and the state governments saw the treaty as an attempt to encroach on local government authority, and attempts were made in Congress to void it. \"No action of Martin's life brought down on him more condemnation than this [the Hopewell Treaty],\" wrote historian Stephen B. Weeks of the incident.\n\nConsequently, his appointment as agent was not renewed, despite Henry's repeated entreaties to political allies for Martin's reinstatement. (In a 1789 letter to Senator William Grayson, Henry reminded his political ally that Martin had been so effective in his Indian dealings during the Revolutionary War that British agents had offered rewards to their Indian allies for Martin's scalp.)\n\nBut the forces allied against Martin overwhelmed Henry's defense, and in 1789, his career as Indian agent finished, General Martin sold his large holdings in the Powell's Valley and near Cumberland Gap and returned to his lands in Henry County next door to Henry's to spend the rest of his life. A year later, in 1790, when the governorship of the Southwest Territory opened up, Patrick Henry suggested Gen. Martin, along with George Mason, for the job, but both were passed over in favor of William Blount.\nLater Judgments on Martin's career as an Indian agent have been mixed. Writing in 1894, Theodore Roosevelt called Martin \"a firm friend of the red race, [who] had earnestly striven to secure justice for them.\"\n\nIn his peripatetic life on the frontier, Martin was called upon to serve in the legislatures of several states. He served as a member of the North Carolina Convention called to approve the United States Constitution, and served several times in the North Carolina General Assembly. Martin was subsequently elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, until he finally chose to retire because of advanced age. (In 1787 the North Carolina assembly chose Martin as Brigadier General of the Washington District.) During his time in the Virginia legislature, Martin was one of the primary supporters of James Madison's Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions. During his military service in Georgia, Martin was elected to the Georgia legislature in 1783.\n\nMartin was also initially a member of the Watauga Association, which supported the founding of the State of Franklin. Martin subsequently resigned his membership when he saw that it might compromise his role as Indian agent.\n\nIn 1799, Martin and his old friend Major John Redd of Henry County served as the two county representatives on the Virginia commission relating to the Alien and Sedition Acts.\n\nGen. Joseph Martin, Jr.'s first wife was Sarah Lucas. They were both born in Virginia and together had seven children, including Revolutionary War officer, Col. William L. Martin, who eventually moved to Smith County, in Middle Tennessee.\n\nAfter Sarah Lucas Martin's death, Joseph Martin, Jr. married Susannah Graves in Henry County, Virginia. They had 11 children, all of whom were born in Virginia, including: Col. Joseph Martin of Henry County, Va. He was one of five of Gen. Martin's sons who served in the War of 1812.\n\nAnother Martin son, and veteran of the War of 1812, was Patrick Henry Martin. He was a young, trained lawyer, and died a bachelor on his trip home after the war. He was named in honor of Gen. Martin's friend and neighbor, Governor Patrick Henry. Gen. Martin's son, Capt. Lewis Graves Martin, also a veteran of the War of 1812, moved from Henry County, Virginia to Rutherford/Cannon County in Middle Tennessee, in 1816, where he married Belinda Rucker (daughter of Gideon Rucker, Sr. & Joyce Reade; both of whom were born in Va. and moved to Middle Tennessee). They had a large family before Belinda's death in the late 1830s. Capt. Lewis G. Martin remarried and removed to Missouri in 1840. Another Martin son, and veteran of the War of 1812, was Thomas Martin. He also moved to Middle Tennessee where he married Georgia Carr (daughter of Dabney Carr). Alexander Martin, another son and veteran of the War of 1812, also moved to Middle Tennessee. He married Elizabeth Carr (daughter of John Fyndall Carr, also a Tennessean from Virginia), and after some years, moved to Missouri. Another son of Gen. Martin and Susannah Graves was Esq. Judge John C. Martin, who also moved to Middle Tennessee in the days following the War of 1812, where he became a judge and chairman of the Cannon County courts, and served five terms as county executive. He was also responsible for the construction of the original Cannon County court house, erected in 1830. He married Sophia Rucker, sister to his brother Lewis' wife, Belinda.\n\nOther children of Gen. Martin include: George Martin (1763 - 1799), Martha Martin Cleveland, Elizabeth Martin Waller (1768 - 1805), Brice Martin (1770 - 1856), Jesse Martin (1786 - 1836), and Susan Martin King (1799 - 1867).\n\nGen. Martin also had two children with his half-Cherokee, common law wife (\"frontier wife\"), Elizabeth Ward, daughter of frontiersman Bryant Ward and his wife Nancy, \"the beloved woman of the Cherokee.\" One of their children may have been Nancy Martin Hildebrand (1778 - 1837).\n\nThe Native Indian connection of two members of the Martin family has created some confusion for some Martin genealogy researchers; Gen. Joseph Martin's brother, Capt. John \"Jack\" Calvin Martin, Sr., of his N.C. Rock House Plantation, a.k.a. Rock Castle Plantation, is often confused with his brother Gen. Joseph Martin. Capt. John \"Jack\" Martin, Sr. moved from Virginia to N.C. with his brother William Martin, Sr.. In N.C. Capt. John \"Jack\" Martin, Sr. married a Miss Emory, who was half Native American. She died early in their marriage. Her widower, \"Jack,\" then married her sister, a second Miss Emory. This same Capt. John \"Jack\" Martin, Sr. and his Emory wife were the parents of a John Calvin Martin, Jr. who served as a judge on the supreme court of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, although he was only 1/4 Cherokee. This Oklahoma judge was the older cousin of the Tennessee judge of the same name; the son of Gen. Joseph Martin and wife Susannah Graves, as mentioned earlier; Esq. Judge, John C. Martin of Tennessee. There were two Martin cousins with the same name who both served as judges. Although they were born many miles and many years apart, their identities are sometimes confused by modern researchers looking at the names alone.\n\nAnother brother of Gen. Joseph Martin, William Martin, Sr., was the father of Gen. William \"Buck\" Martin, Jr., who served in the War of 1812 on Andrew Jackson's staff.\n\nGen. Martin, after helping adjudicate the western boundary line between North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia as far as the Cumberland Mountains, retired to his plantation \"Belmont\" on Leatherwood Creek, which he had purchased in 1796 from Benjamin Harrison V of Berkeley Plantation, which was originally built by a Capt. John Martin who was possibly the great-uncle of General Joseph Martin. General Joseph Martin died at his plantation on December 18, 1808, and was buried there in the family cemetery. Buried in the family graveyard are three other Joseph Martins: Colonel Joseph Martin, son of the general, his son Joseph, and his grandson Joseph, who lived at \"Greenwood\" plantation.\n\nInitially known as Henry Courthouse, the town of Martinsville, Virginia, was later renamed in honor of this early soldier, planter, pioneer, and real estate speculator. For many years afterwards, General Martin remained an obscure figure, until Lyman Draper began collecting reminiscences about him, including those of Major John Redd, a prominent Henry County planter who served under Martin, and who also wrote about his early recollections of General Nathanael Greene, George Rogers Clark, Daniel Boone, Col. Benjamin Cleveland, Dr. John Walker, and other early prominent Virginia figures.\n\nMartin's descendants include his second eldest son Col. William Martin, Tennessee pioneer, and member of the South Carolina and Georgia legislatures; son Col. Joseph Martin, member of the Virginia House of Delegates, the Virginia State Senate and the Virginia Constitutional Convention 1829–1830; daughter Martha Martin, who was the 1st wife of William Cleveland, son of John (Preacher John) Cleveland, Jr., brother of Benjamin Cleveland, hero of the Battle of King's Mountain; William Cleveland was a nephew of Benjamin Cleveland; son Major Brice Martin, Tennessee pioneer and surveyor in 1801 of the disputed boundary between Virginia and Tennessee;. Other descendants: Dr. Jesse Martin Shackelford, founder of Martinsville's Shackelford Hospital, later Martinsville Memorial; Judge Nicholas H. Hairston of Roanoke.; United States Senator from Virginia Thomas Staples Martin from Charlottesville, Virginia.; Judge John Dillard of the North Carolina Supreme Court; American theologian and Biblical Greek scholar Archibald Thomas Robertson.; Alabama Governors Joshua L. Martin, Gabriel Moore, John A. Winston, and Charles Henderson; as well as Alfred M. Scales, Confederate General in the Civil War, and subsequently Governor of North Carolina. Also descended from Martin was Henry Smith Pritchett, an educator born in Missouri who served as president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nGeneral Joseph Martin, Jr. owned a slave named 'Toby' from the time Toby was about 25 years old, and in his letters to historian Lyman Draper, Martin's son Col. William Martin told Draper that Toby, \"a bright mulatto, a little under middle stature, of great physical powers, as well as mental\" had served his father for many years and had distinguished himself in several battles. It was General Martin's intention, noted his son, that Toby be freed at Joseph Martin's death, but the General died intestate.\n\nTaking note of the General's affection for his longtime servant, as well as the Martin's family members' sentiments toward Martin's constant companion, the family elected \"by mutual consent\" to leave Toby out of the inventory of General Martin's estate, and Toby \"has ever since been free, and has made himself a good estate.\" In his letter to Draper, Col. William Martin calls the freed slave \"my fine old brother Toby.\"\n\nOn June 27–29, 2008, 200 descendants of General Joseph Martin gathered in the city named for him to unveil a monument in his honor, at the Gen. Joseph Martin, Jr. Bicentennial Celebration.\n\n\n"}

His last match in FMW during this tenure was a win against Masato Tanaka on September 27, before Atsushi Onita sent Ezaki overseas to learn the lucha libre style in Mexico.\n\nEzaki adopted the Hayabusa character in December 1993 while in Mexico. While there, he learned the lucha libre style from wrestling instructor Rey Misterio, Sr. Ezaki wrestled for the World Wrestling Association, Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) during his time in Mexico. He then returned to Japan to participate in the 1994 Super J-Cup tournament for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he competed as Hayabusa in Japan for the first time to test how the crowd reacted to his character in Japan. He faced Jushin Liger in a losing effort in a well received first round match of the tournament. The following month, Hayabusa debuted for CMLL on May 17 by teaming with Ringo Mendoza and La Sombra to defeat Javier Cruz, Panico and Tornado Negro in a two out of three falls match. He teamed with Super Astro in the number one contender's tournament for the vacated World Tag Team Championship, where the duo lost to El Dandy and Negro Casas in the opening round. During his time in Mexico, Víctor Quiñones would offer Ezaki a contract to defect to IWA Japan, but declined, showing loyalty to FMW. He appeared as Hayabusa in FMW for the first time at Summer Spectacular on August 28, 1994 by defeating Sabu. He then returned to CMLL to team with fellow Japanese wrestler Último Dragón in the 1994 Copa de Oro on October 25 in a loss to eventual winners Apolo Dantés and El Dandy in the quarter-final. The following month, Hayabusa and Dragon participated in the number two contender's tournament for the World Tag Team Championship, where they defeated El Felino and Mano Negra in the first round before losing to El Satánico and Emilio Charles Jr. in the quarter-final. He would remain in Mexico until December 1994.\n\nBetween January 1995 and April 1995, Ezaki wrestled in the United States, mainly in the Florida area. During this time, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) was interested in Ezaki and offered a tryout, but he declined and remained with FMW.\n\nEzaki was scheduled to make his full-time return to FMW as Hayabusa at the company's 6th Anniversary Show against The Gladiator on May 5, 1995. However, he was chosen by FMW's new owner Shoichi Arai to fill the spot as Atsushi Onita's opponent in Onita's retirement match at the event as Onita wanted his final opponent to succeed him as the promotion's ace after Onita's originally supposed opponent Tarzan Goto left FMW and there was no main event star left to be Onita's opponent. Hayabusa returned to FMW at the 6th Anniversary Show, where he unsuccessfully challenged Onita for the Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship in an exploding cage barbed wire deathmatch. During the match, Ezaki managed to kick out of Onita's \"Thunder Fire Powerbomb\" and gave a huge fight. He was rushed to the hospital on a stretcher due to suffering severe burns but became Onita's successor as the ace of FMW. Hayabusa returned to the company on May 17 by teaming with Katsutoshi Niiyama against Lethal Weapon members The Gladiator and Horace Boulder in a losing effort to begin his first rivalry in the company with Lethal Weapon. He was the leader of the new generation of FMW wrestlers including Niiyama, Masato Tanaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Koji Nakagawa. He wrestled the group's members in several tag matches for the next one month after Lethal Weapon questioned his ability to become the ace of FMW and vowed to take over the company. He initially struggled to gain a fanbase after Onita's loyal fans refused to accept him but Hayabusa got to impress the Japanese fans by debuting the \"Phoenix Splash\" against Lethal Weapon member Ricky Fuji during a match on May 28. Hayabusa's team lost but the \"Phoenix Splash\" was heavily promoted by the Japanese media, which helped FMW in regaining the fanbase and Ezaki started becoming popular due to his high-flying skills.\n\nJust one month after his re-debut, Ezaki was booked to win the promotion's top title, the vacant Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship by defeating Lethal Weapon member Hisakatsu Oya on June 27 by debuting his new finishing move, \"Falcon Arrow\". However, he immediately vacated the title due to injury but a storyline was created that he vacated it because he wanted to beat Gladiator and all the members of the W*ING Alliance. The title was put up for grabs in the Grand Slam Tournament, an eight-man tournament in the round-robin format and Ezaki was put in the tournament. However, before the tournament started, Ezaki was severely injured by The Gladiator in a match on July 30 but he insisted that he would compete in the tournament. Ezaki started the tournament on August 22 by defeating Masato Tanaka. He won his next match against W*ING Kanemura on August 25 to gain four points. He competed against Hisakatsu Oya to a thirty-minute time limit draw and defeated The Gladiator and Katsutoshi Niiyama to gain nine points in the tournament. He suffered his first loss in the tournament against Super Leather and then defeated Mitsuhiro Matsunaga to qualify for the final. He lost to Gladiator in the final round of the Grand Slam on September 25. Ezaki competed against W*ING and Lethal Weapon members in various tag team matches, street fights and deathmatches throughout the rest of the year and early 1996 before taking time off due to multiple injuries.\n\nDespite the injury, Hayabusa returned to FMW on March 30 to rescue Jason the Terrible from an assault by Mr. Pogo and The Headhunters to set up the main event for the company's 7th Anniversary Show on May 5, where he teamed with Masato Tanaka to take on Pogo and Terry Funk in a no rope explosive barbed wire time bomb land mine double hell death match and the winner would receive one million yens. Hayabusa was pinned by Funk after a brutal match. After the one-off return, Ezaki continued to heal his injuries and did not compete in FMW for the next three months. On August 1, he made his return to full-time competition by defeating Koji Nagakawa at the Summer Spectacular event. On September 11, Ezaki debuted an alter ego called Darkside Hayabusa during a street fight against Hido at a W*ING show, which Ezaki won. On September 20, Jinsei Shinzaki of Michinoku Pro Wrestling challenged Hayabusa to a match, who Hayabusa lost to in the main event of Michinoku Pro Wrestling's \"These Days\" event. This marked the beginning of a future friendship between the two. Following the match, The Great Sasuke challenged Hayabusa to a match at FMW's Year End Spectacular on December 11, which Ezaki won.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Terry Funk formed the Funk Masters of Wrestling group, which replaced Lethal Weapon as the new antagonist group and Hayabusa wrestled the group's members throughout the rest of 1996 and much of 1997. Ezaki's former friend Mr. Gannosuke returned to FMW and attacked Hayabusa after Hayabusa and Katsutoshi Niiyama lost to The Headhunters in a tag team match on January 5, 1997. As a result of the attack, Hayabusa began a lengthy and emotional rivalry with Gannosuke that would continue for the rest of his career. During this time, Ricky Fuji sided with FMW after the demise of Lethal Weapon and became an ally of Hayabusa. On March 19, Hayabusa got his first title shot in nearly two years as he and Fuji challenged The Headhunters for the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship in a losing effort. The following month, Ezaki served as the centerpiece of FMW during a meeting with All Japan Pro Wrestling owner Giant Baba to begin a partnership between AJPW and FMW and subsequently made his AJPW debut at the 1997 Champion Carnival by teaming with Yoshinobu Kanemaru against Kentaro Shiga and Yoshinari Ogawa in a losing effort. This paved the way for wrestlers of AJPW and FMW to sporadically appear in both companies and began Hayabusa's occasional appearances in AJPW. Hayabusa defeated Gannosuke in a hair vs. hair match at FMW's 8th Anniversary Show. After the match, Hayabusa said that Gannosuke's hair would not be cut off if he left Funk Masters of Wrestling and side with FMW and Gannosuke apparently shook his hands and then attacked Hayabusa, thus removed his mask and attempted to blow fire on him until Jinsei Shinzaki made the save.\n\nAs a result, Hayabusa formed a tag team with Shinzaki. They teamed with each other for the first time by teaming with Koji Nakagawa against Funk Masters of Wrestling members Hisakatsu Oya, Mr. Gannosuke and The Gladiator in a six-man tag team match on July 19. On August 5, Hayabusa teamed with Nakagawa and Ricky Fuji in a tournament for the vacant World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. They lost to eventual winners Oya, Gannosuke and Gladiator in the semi-final round. On August 31, the trio of Hayabusa, Nakagawa and Masato Tanaka defeated Oya, Gannosuke and Gladiator to win the World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. On September 28, Hayabusa wrestled two matches on the same day. He first appeared in a tag team match for AJPW at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo by teaming with Mitsuharu Misawa to defeat Jun Akiyama and Saturo Asako. He then travelled to Kawasaki, Kanagawa to compete at FMW's Fall Spectacular at the Kawasaki Stadium, where he and Shinzaki lost to AJPW's Kenta Kobashi and Maunakea Mossman in a highly acclaimed tag team match. On October 14, Hayabusa, Nakagawa and Tanaka dropped the six-man tag team title to ZEN members Atsushi Onita, Hido and Tetsuhiro Kuroda. This marked the beginning of a feud between Hayabusa and Onita as Onita wanted to stay on the top of FMW while Ezaki wanted to remain the ace of the company.\n\nHayabusa and Shinzaki participated in AJPW's 1997 Real World Tag League and kicked off the tournament on November 19 by defeating Giant Kimala and Jun Izumida. They finished the tournament with four points as they would win only one more match against Johnny Smith and Wolf Hawkfield, while losing the rest of their matches. Hayabusa and Masato Tanaka faced Mr. Gannosuke and Yukihiro Kanemura in a losing effort for the vacant Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship on November 28. Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki unsuccessfully challenged Gannosuke and Kanemura for the tag team title on December 19. On December 20, Hayabusa, Hisakatsu Oya and Masato Tanaka won the World Street Fight Six-Man Tag Team Championship by beating Atsushi Onita, Hido and Tetsuhiro Kuroda during the Super Extreme Wrestling War tour. On December 22, Hayabusa, Jinsei Shinzaki and Masato Tanaka defeated ZEN members Atsushi Onita, Mr. Gannosuke and Yukihiro Kanemura in a WarGames match after Hayabusa pinned Onita after a Moonsault from the top of the cage as a payback for his loss to Onita at 6th Anniversary Show in 1995. Hayabusa started getting over with the audience and he was finally being heavily pushed. Friction arose within ZEN and Gannosuke formed his own group Team No Respect. On January 16, 1998, Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka and Hisakatsu Oya lost their six-man tag team title to Team No Respect members Gannosuke, Yukihiro Kanemura and Jado. Hayabusa and his allies battled Team No Respect members for the next three months and Hayabusa lost a singles match to TNR member Kodo Fuyuki in the first singles encounter between the two on February 19 to begin a long lasting rivalry with Fuyuki.\n\nThe following month, Hayabusa won a tournament by defeating Masato Tanaka, Jado and The Gladiator to become the #1 contender for his rival Mr. Gannosuke's FMW Double Championship, the unified Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and the Independent Heavyweight Championship. On April 17, Hayabusa and Masato Tanaka defeated Hido and Kodo Fuyuki to win the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship. On April 30, Hayabusa defeated Mr. Gannosuke to win the Double Titles Championship at FMW's first pay-per-view 9th Anniversary Show: Entertainment Wrestling Live. Immediately after the title win, Hayabusa appeared at AJPW's twenty-fifth anniversary show Showdown at the Egg, where he teamed with AJPW owner Giant Baba and Kentaro Shiga against Jinsei Shinzaki, Jun Izumida and Giant Kimala. Hayabusa got the win for his team by pinning Izumida. Hayabusa made his first title defense of the Double Championship against his tag team championship partner Masato Tanaka on May 19, where Hayabusa retained the title. The match between the two earned critical acclaim and is highly regarded as the best match of Ezaki's career. On May 27, Hayabusa and Tanaka lost the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship to Kodo Fuyuki and Yukihiro Kanemura.\n\nShortly after, Tanaka left FMW and Ezaki made Daisuke Ikeda his new tag team partner. During this time, Gannosuke was injured and Kodo Fuyuki became the new leader of Team No Respect. Hayabusa and his allies split wins with Team No Respect at the June and July pay-per-views. On August 2, Hayabusa made an appearance for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) at the Heat Wave pay-per-view where he and Jinsei Shinzaki unsuccessfully challenged Rob Van Dam and Sabu for the ECW World Tag Team Championship. Hayabusa returned to FMW to begin a feud with Koji Nakagawa after Nakagawa pinned him to win an elimination tag team match. As a result, Hayabusa faced him as \"Darkside Hayabusa\" in a losing effort at the Welcome to the Darkside pay-per-view. On September 1, Hayabusa successfully defended the Double Championship in his third defense against Hisakatsu Oya after the duo wrestled to a thirty-minute time limit draw. He made his next title defense against Jado on September 20, where he retained and then teamed with Ricky Fuji to take on Kodo Fuyuki, Koji Nakagawa and Gedo in an immediate handicap match, which he lost and this earned Nakagawa and Fuyuki title shots at the Double Championship.\n\nEzaki successfully defended the title against Nakagawa at the October pay-per-view. On October 26, Hayabusa and Ikeda defeated Kodo Fuyuki and Yukihiro Kanemura to capture the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship. They made only one title defense against Hideki Hosaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda on November 14. On November 20, Hayabusa lost the Double Championship to Fuyuki in his sixth title defense. Hayabusa participated in an Over the Top tournament to earn a title shot at the Double Championship by defeating Gedo in the first round, before losing to Hisakatsu Oya in the quarter-final round at the ECW/FMW Supershow II.\n\nIn early 1999, Hayabusa and Daisuke Ikeda vacated the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship after Ikeda suffered an injury. On January 16, 1999, Hayabusa reunited with Jinsei Shinzaki at an AJPW show to challenge Tamon Honda and Jun Izumida for the All Asia Tag Team Championship in a losing effort. Hayabusa and Shinzaki were granted a rematch on February 13, in which they defeated Honda and Izumida to capture the All Asia Tag Team Championship. Hayabusa and Shinzaki made their first and only successful title defense against Masato Tanaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda on March 19. Hayabusa renewed his rivalry with Mr. Gannosuke and formed an alliance with rival Double Champion Kodo Fuyuki. Hayabusa and Fuyuki entered a round robin tournament for the vacant Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship, where they qualified for the finals by topping the tournament with thirteen points by winning all of their matches except fighting Masato Tanaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda to a thirty-minute time limit draw on March 29. On May 3, Hayabusa and Fuyuki lost to Tanaka and Kuroda in the final round. After the match, Hayabusa poured water on Fuyuki to revive him which angered Fuyuki and the two came to blows and this ended the partnership between the two. On May 5, Hayabusa and Shinzaki took on Tanaka and Kuroda in a tag team match where the winner of the fall would earn a Double Championship match against Kodo Fuyuki in the main event and Kuroda pinned Hayabusa to earn the title shot. Fuyuki took over as the new commissioner of FMW and an alliance was formed between Gannosuke's Outlaws and Team No Respect. On May 31, Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka, Tetsuhiro Kuroda, Hideki Hosaka and Hisakatsu Oya faced Kodo Fuyuki, Mr. Gannosuke, Hido, Koji Nakagawa and Yukihiro Kanemura in a five-on-five elimination tag team match which Hayabusa's FMW team won with a clean sweep as his entire team survived. On June 4, Hayabusa and Shinzaki lost the All Asia Tag Team Championship to No Fear (Takao Omori and Yoshihiro Takayama).\n\nEzaki had suffered multiple injuries during the past few years of his career which forced him to change his wrestling style from high flying to mat wrestling. This was incorporated into a storyline that Kodo Fuyuki would not allow Ezaki to wear the falcon mask and compete as Hayabusa anymore. This led Ezaki to go through a character change. On June 15, Hayabusa teamed with Masato Tanaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda to defeat Mr. Gannosuke, Yukihiro Kanemura and Hido in a ladder match which stipulated that Fuyuki had to eat dog food if his team lost. FMW held a series of events titled \"Goodbye Hayabusa\" as a farewell to Ezaki's Hayabusa character. During this time, he participated in a tournament with Tanaka and Kuroda for the newly created WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship. Hayabusa and his team reached the finals of the tournament on July 31, where they lost to Kodo Fuyuki, Gedo and Koji Nakagawa. At , Hayabusa defeated Yukihiro Kanemura to win his third Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and made his first and only title defense against Mr. Gannosuke on August 25 in his as Hayabusa, which he won to retain the title. The title was immediately retired.\n\nOn August 27, Ezaki debuted his new character H, with a complete makeover of colored hair, a tattooed chest and jeans. Ezaki won his first match as H, an elimination match against Team No Respect. Gannosuke was injured in the match and then he attacked H under the Hayabusa costume and attire on September 3, thus instigating a feud between H and Hayabusa. This led to an anus exploding match between the two on October 29, which ended in a no contest. At the 10th Anniversary Show, H defeated fake Hayabusa in the main event, with Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee. H and Gannosuke reconciled after the match by shaking hands with each other to end their rivalry and form a tag team. On December 1, H and Gannosuke defeated Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Hisakatsu Oya to win the WEW Tag Team Championship. H and Gannosuke lost the title to Kodo Fuyuki and Kyoko Inoue on February 25, 2000. H defeated Inoue in singles action on March 27.\n\nOn April 3, H represented FMW against the new ECW Japan leader Kodo Fuyuki in a losing effort. H began feuding with Masato Tanaka due to Tanaka confronting him on forgiving Mr. Gannosuke. Ezaki and Gannosuke lost to Tanaka and Balls Mahoney in a tag team match on April 11, during which Ezaki went backstage as H and then competed as Hayabusa for the first time in several months. Ezaki's H character had failed to garner crowd support and ticket sales were dwindling, which caused Ezaki to slowly transition back to compete as Hayabusa. At Backdraft, he competed as Hayabusa in a win over Tanaka. On May 28, H competed against Gannosuke and Tetsuhiro Kuroda in a three-way dance to determine the #1 contender for the WEW Heavyweight Championship with the champion Kodo Fuyuki as the special guest referee. H eliminated Kuroda and then Gannosuke turned on H by hitting with a crutch and pinned him with Fuyuki's help and became a member of Shin Fuyuki-Gun. On June 16, Ezaki unleashed Darkside of H and brought \"Hayabusa\" as his tag team partner for a match against GOEMON and Kodo Fuyuki. H and Hayabusa won the match to take revenge from Shin-Fuyuki-Gun for attacking and kidnapping Ricky Fuji. On June 26, H won the WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship with Hisakatsu Oya and Tetsuhiro Kuroda by defeating Kodo Fuyuki, Kyoko Inoue and Chocoball Mukai. On July 22, Ezaki retired his H character and announced that he would begin competing as Hayabusa again after he and Tetsuhiro Kuroda defeated The Samoans (Eddie Fatu and Matty Samu).\n\nOn July 23, Ezaki revived his Hayabusa character after a year and defeated Shin Fuyuki-Gun members in a gauntlet match to earn an immediate WEW Heavyweight Championship match against Kodo Fuyuki, which he lost after Jinsei Shinzaki turned on Hayabusa. On July 28, Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka and Hisakatsu Oya defeated Fuyuki, Shinzaki and Mr. Gannosuke after Hayabusa pinned Gannosuke. This set up a match against Gannosuke on August 28, which Hayabusa won to earn a shot at Fuyuki's WEW Heavyweight Championship. On September 15, Hayabusa, Hisakatsu Oya and Tetsuhiro Kuroda lost the WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship to Fuyuki, Gannosuke and Shinjuku Shark. On September 21, Hayabusa defeated Fuyuki in a non-title 15,000 volt thunderbolt cage death match. On September 26, Hayabusa took on Fuyuki for the WEW Heavyweight Championship in a sixty-minute Iron Man match, which ended in a draw. Hayabusa called it the hardest match of his career. After the match, Hayabusa demanded another title shot, which Fuyuki agreed. On October 29, Hayabusa and Onryo defeated GOEMON and Fuyuki in a tag team match. On November 12, Hayabusa got another title shot against Fuyuki at the Deep Throat pay-per-view, but lost the match. Hayabusa and Fuyuki ended the feud after the match by shaking hands with each other and then Tetsuhiro Kuroda turned on Hayabusa by attacking him. Hayabusa then took time off to heal his injured arms.\n\nHayabusa had a successful double elbow surgery on November 22. He returned to FMW at a pay-per-view on December 20 as a color commentator, along with Mr. Gannosuke, who had retired from wrestling after losing to Tetsuhiro Kuroda. During the match, Kuroda mocked Hayabusa to anger him and Hayabusa headed to the ring but Gannosuke held him back. On February 6, 2001, Hayabusa made another non-wrestling appearance to confront Kuroda along with The Masked Sumo. Sumo turned on Gannosuke and Kuroda injured Hayabusa's arms with a folding chair until The Great Sasuke made the save. On April 1, Hayabusa appeared during Kuroda and Kodo Fuyuki's WEW Heavyweight Championship match, where he attacked Mr. Gannosuke after Gannosuke attacked Fuyuki during the match and then Kuroda and his allies attacked Hayabusa until Sasuke came to his rescue again. Hayabusa made his in-ring return at the 12th Anniversary Show on May 5 by teaming with Sasuke to defeat Kuroda and Gannosuke in an octagon cage electric bomb death match. This match also commemorated the tenth anniversary of his FMW debut. On May 11, Hayabusa pinned Kuroda in a six-man tag team match to earn a title shot at Kuroda. On May 22, Hayabusa defeated Kuroda in a double hell barbed wire deathmatch to win the WEW Heavyweight Championship, with Kodo Fuyuki as the special guest referee.\n\nOn June 8, Fuyuki bought FMW from Shoichi Arai in storyline and gave the wrestlers option to either side with Arai or Fuyuki. Hayabusa sided with Arai by revealing that he had purchased 5% stock of the company. Tetsuhiro Kuroda also refused to side with Fuyuki and this resulted in Hayabusa and Kuroda being paired to take on Mr. Gannosuke and Kintaro Kanemura in a tag team match, which they lost. Hayabusa made his first title defense of the WEW Heavyweight Championship against Mammoth Sasaki on July 30, where he retained the title. On August 3, Hayabusa offered to put his 5% stock if he, GOEMON and Onryo lost the six-man tag team match to Mr. Gannosuke, Kintaro Kanemura and Mammoth Sasaki. Hayabusa was pinned by Kanemura and he agreed to put his 5% stock in a two out of three match series on August 11. The FMW team and Fuyuki's team were even with 1–1 score until Hayabusa lost the WEW Heavyweight Championship to Kanemura in the main event. As a result of losing the series, Hayabusa lost his 5% stock to Fuyuki and Fuyuki sold the stock to Stuart Levy. On September 5, Hayabusa defeated Kanemura to regain the title but the win was reversed by new FMW Vice President Senmu Yoshida, who returned the title to Kanemura.\n\nOn September 9, Hayabusa teamed with Tetsuhiro Kuroda and GOEMON to defeat Kintaro Kanemura, Kodo Fuyuki and Mr. Gannosuke to win the WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship. The following month, on October 9, Hayabusa and Kuroda defeated Gannosuke and Mammoth Sasaki to win the WEW Tag Team Championship. After the match, Sasaki challenged Hayabusa to a match which stipulated that if Hayabusa won then Shoichi Arai would be reinstated as FMW President. The match took place on October 22, during which Hayabusa suffered a career-ending injury when he attempted a springboard moonsault off the middle rope and lost footing, landing on his head, cracking two of his vertebrae and leaving him paralyzed. The injury provoked a high fever and required surgery. This injury ended his wrestling career. As he was considered the heart and soul of FMW, the company slowly folded after his departure.\n\nEzaki later pursued a career as a singer. He promoted a new wrestling company called WMF (Wrestlings Marvelous Future) that contained up-and-coming wrestlers. The name was chosen since, spelled backwards, the initials are FMW in honor of the late company. He traveled to a few WWE events where he met old friends such as Sabu, Rob Van Dam, and Rey Mysterio backstage. He also took photographs with Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon, and Triple H, and spoke with Jeff Hardy.\n\nEzaki attended the PWU (Pro Wrestling Unplugged) FAHRENHEIT: 3RD DEGREE event on August 19, 2006, at the New Alhambra (formerly known as ECW Arena). This was his first appearance in the USA since 2000, the last time being at E3 in Los Angeles, helping promote TOKYOPOP's FMW DVDs by having a 6-man tag match. He also participated in a shoot interview with RF Video.\n\nEzaki was active in working with the Dragon Gate promotion. He recorded a debut album with Dragon Kid titled \"Trust!\" which came out in November 2007. He partook in the company's first US tour, joining them in their appearance in Los Angeles on September 5 and Hawaii on September 8, 2008. Ezaki also designed the tour's T-shirt. When asked about his career in an interview, Ezaki said that one never knows what the chances are of a return to the ring.\n\nOn 3 April 2015, Hayabusa was part of a press conference announcing the return of FMW. He served as the executive producer of the promotion.\n\nEzaki was considered to be one of the greatest professional wrestlers in the history of professional wrestling and one of the pioneers of high-flying and junior heavyweight wrestling in Japan. He was the innovator of \"Falcon Arrow\" and \"Phoenix Splash\" and also popularized the \"Firebird Splash\", which would become famous in North America as the 450° splash. He was the most popular and greatest star in the history of Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, where he spent the entirety of his career. Due to his impressive talent, Ezaki received offers with better salaries from New Japan Pro-Wrestling and World Wrestling Federation, which could have driven him to success but he rejected all those offers out of loyalty to FMW. He worked hard as the company's ace, even putting his body on the line and worked in some of the greatest matches in the company's history.\n\nHis match with Masato Tanaka on May 19, 1998, was considered by many to be the greatest match of his career and considered to be the second best FMW match only behind Combat Toyoda vs. Megumi Kudo at 7th Anniversary Show. He had memorable rivalries and clashes with Mr. Gannosuke, Kodo Fuyuki and The Gladiator. His feud with Gannosuke would feature both men in many epic encounters and major matches between 1997 and 2001 and was considered the biggest feud in FMW history. They headlined many shows including 8th Anniversary Show, 9th Anniversary Show and 10th Anniversary Show as well as the main event of pay-per-view which was the last match of the Hayabusa character in 1999.\n\nKevin Wilson reviewed on the 9th Anniversary Show encounter between the two that \"both wrestlers played their roles well and they hit their major moves without any problems. I still think the Phoenix Splash is one of the top five most beautiful moves in wrestling (let's see... Phoenix Splash, Shooting Star Press, Space Flying Tiger Drop, Ultimo Dragon's Asai Moonsault, and a Dragonrana), and Hayabusa hit it perfectly. It was the perfect ending, as the two other times he had gone for the move in the match he had failed... he knew that to win the titles he had to hit his ultimate finisher. Overall a really fun match, it wasn't perfectly executed, but the good far outweighed the bad.\" Stuart of Puroresu Central stated that \"Hayabusa's highspots were dazzling as always and Gannosuke's craftsmanship made them look better and very important. They fought almost one year exactly before this and Hayabusa smoked Gannosuke as a worker\" and considered it \"a worthy main event between two excellent wrestlers and undoubtedly the best match on the show.\"\n\nMany of the industry's wrestlers like Chris Jericho, Jack Evans, AJ Styles, Neville and Kalisto were inspired by Hayabusa at some point in their careers.\n\n\nEzaki was the oldest of two sons. His grandparents on his mother's side of the family were owners of a hotel, before his parents took over.\n\nEzaki married his wife Harumi on April 7, 1997. Together, they had two daughters, Ayane (born October 19, 1997) and Shie (born May 10, 1999). He and Harumi amicably divorced in 2004, but remained friends, while sharing custody of their daughters.\n\nEzaki was close friends with Jyushin Thunder Liger since 1994. The two had a falling out in 1996 after Ezaki turned down a deal with NJPW, but they mended their friendship in 2005.\n\nIn May 2005, he performed a play called The Shinichi Amano Story at the Tokyo Shinjuku Theater. He portrayed the main character's best friend Fuyuki Hayato, an injured air pilot soldier in World War II, who is wheelchair-bound. His performance was given positive reviews and the play was a huge success.\n\nOn April 25, 2010, his father died.\n\nBy 2015, Ezaki had regained the use of his legs and could stand on his own and walk with a cane.\n\nEzaki died of a cerebral hemorrhage on March 3, 2016 at age 47. His body was found when the owner of a nearby tavern, with whom he was scheduled to meet concerning a March 7 event, went to his home after Ezaki failed to arrive for their planned meeting.\n\n\n"}

Furthermore, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters was not keen to permit a repeat of the political experimentation undertaken by the Kwangtung Army in the establishment of Manchukuo, and pressured the Japanese Central China Area Army to establish a collaborationist local government to handle the details of local administration for the Shanghai metropolitan area.\n\nIn November 1937, a number of well-known residents were approached to take over provisional civilian administration of the city. Eventually, the Japanese were able to secure the assistance of Fu Xiao'an, the wealthy director of the Chinese Bank of Commerce and head of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Fu was a personal and political enemy of Nationalist general Chiang Kai-shek and had been imprisoned by the Kuomintang in 1927 for refusing to lend Chiang money. After his release from prison, he fled to Japanese-held Manchuria, and lived several years under Japanese protection, nursing his hatred for Chiang.\n\nHowever, Fu was unwilling to head the new government himself, and recommended Su Xiwen, a professor of religious philosophy and political science at the Chizhi University in Jiangwan. Su was a graduate of Waseda University in Tokyo and was known for his conservative political views. Su was also known for his views on Buddhist-Daoist syncretism, which influenced the name of the new administration—the \"Great Way\" referring to Eastern philosophy's concept of the Tao—and its flag: the yin-yang symbol of Daoism on a yellow background. (The colors yellow, gold, and saffron are often associated with Buddhism.)\n\nThe new government quickly made efforts to restore the city's public services and established a police force under the command of Zhang Songlin, former commander of the Jiangsu provincial police, to maintain public order. Funding was provided by a tax levied on all imports and exports through the Japanese front lines into and out of Shanghai, and Su was assisted by a number of experts provided by the South Manchurian Railroad Company. Su promised to purge the city of both communist and Kuomintang elements. However, neither Su nor his Great Way Government were regarded seriously by Japanese political agents, who looked with dismay and contempt at the assortment of criminals, religious cultists, and narcotics dealers who gravitated to leading positions in the new administration. The promised public works failed to materialize as Su's cronies siphoned off funds, and the propaganda value of the new administration quickly deteriorated. In December 1937, the Japanese brought in a tough northern Chinese collaborator named Wang Zihui to oversee operations as a temporary measure.\n\nAfter Liang Hongzhi established the Reformed Government of the Republic of China in Nanjing in March 1938, the Japanese Central China Area Army organized a number of public rallies and ceremonies in support. In less than a month, the Reformed Government asserted its authority over the Great Way Government by establishing a Supervisory Yamen to take over the functions of the Shanghai municipal administration. Su Xiwen formally recognized the Reform Government and adopting its flag on May 3, 1938.\n\nUnder the Reformed Government, Su Xiwen continued as head of the Supervisory Yamen until he was replaced by Fu Xiao'an as mayor on October 16, 1938.\n\n"}

There were plans to seize Salisbury, Newcastle, York and Winchester and to instigate smaller uprisings in Nottinghamshire and Cheshire. As the New Model Army garrison in Winchester was reinforced shortly before the uprising, plans to attack it were abandoned. No men answered the call in Cheshire, but elsewhere risings did take place. Due to a lack of support, however, the Royalists disbanded without a fight at all the locations except Salisbury.\n\nPenruddock, along with Sir Joseph Wagstaffe and Hugh Grove, organised and led the Royalist uprising in the West. On 11 March, Penruddock, with between three hundred and four hundred other Cavaliers, took Salisbury and raised the Royal Standard. The next morning, leading his followers out of Salisbury, Penruddock headed westwards through Blandford, Sherborne and Yeovil, hoping to pick up more supporters. By 14 March, his group had reached South Molton in Devon, where, after a three-hour street fight, it was defeated by a single New Model Army troop of horse under Captain Unton Crook. Crook captured Penruddock and the other ringleaders, while most of the other Royalists either fled or were killed.\n\nFor his part in the rebellion, Penruddock, along with Hugh Grove and Francis Jones, was beheaded at Exeter in May 1655. Some of the other Royalists who took part were also executed, while seventy were shipped to the West Indies and sold as indentured labour. Wagstaffe escaped.\n\nPenruddock was married to Arundel Freke, the daughter of John Freke, Esq., of Shrewton, Dorset. They had two sons, George and Thomas, and four daughters, Elizabeth, Joan, Mary, and Anne. Penruddock succeeded his father, Sir John Penruddocke of Compton Chamberlayne, in 1648. His elder son, George, died in 1664, and he was thus succeeded in his estates by his younger son, Thomas Penruddocke (c. 1648–1695), later member of parliament for Wilton.\n\n"}

Popular magazines that have featured gag cartoons include \"Punch\", \"The New Yorker\" and \"Playboy\". Some publications, such as \"Humorama\", have used cartoons as the main focus of the magazine, rather than articles and fiction.\n\nCaptions are usually concise, to fit on a single line. Gag cartoons of the 1930s and earlier occasionally had lengthy captions, sometimes featuring dialogue between two characters depicted in the drawing; over time, cartoon captions became shorter. \n\nIn the mid-1950s, gag cartoonists found a new market with the introduction of highly popular studio cards in college bookstores. Single-panel cartoons have been published on various products, such as coffee mugs and cocktail napkins.\n\nTraditionally, newspapers and magazines printed cartoons in black and white, but this changed in the 1950s when \"Playboy\" began to feature full-page, full-color cartoons in every issue.\n\nThere are numerous collections of cartoons in both paperback and hardcover, notably \"The New Yorker\" collections.\nFrom 1942 to 1971, the cartoonist-novelist Lawrence Lariar edited the annual \"Best Cartoons of the Year\" collections.\n\nA well-known 1928 cartoon in \"The New Yorker\", drawn by Carl Rose and captioned by E.

{"id": "1871605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871605", "title": "Pushan", "text": "Pushan\n\nPushan (, \"\") is a Vedic solar deity and one of the Adityas. He is the god of meeting. Pushan was responsible for marriages, journeys, roads, and the feeding of cattle. He was a psychopomp (soul guide), conducting souls to the other world. He protected travelers from bandits and wild beasts, and protected men from being exploited by other men. He was a supportive guide, a \"good\" god, leading his adherents towards rich pastures and wealth. He carried a golden lance, a symbol of activity.\n\nTraditionally, the name of the deity is said to be derived from Sanskrit verb, \"pūṣyati\", which means \"to cause to thrive\". This, however, is probably a folk etymology.\n\nMany modern scholars consider Pushan to be derived from the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European god \"*Péh₂usōn\", which would thereby make Pushan a cognate of the Greek god Pan. The connection between Pan and Pushan was first proposed by the German scholar Hermann Collitz in 1924.\n\nTen hymns in the Rigveda are dedicated to Pūṣan (including one jointly to Soma and Pūṣan and another to Indra and Pūṣan). Some of these hymns appeal to him to guard livestock and find lost livestock. His chariot is pulled by goats. Sometimes he is described as driving the Sun in its course across the sky. He seems to represent the sun as a guardian of flocks and herds. Pushan is also regarded as Kavi, who in turn became an epiphet of a number of gods and further a title signifying \"king\".\n\nAccording to a narrative found in the Taittiriya Samhita, Rudra was excluded from the Daksha yajna, an important sacrifice in honor of various deities. He, in anger, pierced the sacrifice with an arrow and Pushan broke his teeth as he attempted to eat a part of the oblation. The later versions of this narrative are found in the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and the Puranas. In these versions, Rudra (or Shiva) was angry because his father-in-law, Daksha, the sacrificer, did not invite him. Shiva, in anger, kicked Pushan and knocked out his teeth as he was eating the oblation. In the Puranic versions, Virabhadra, created by Shiva from a lock of his matted hair, knocked out Pushan's teeth.\n\nIn the Puranas, Pushan is described as one of the twelve \"Adityas\" (Aditi's sons). Aditi's other eleven sons as narrated in Purana's are Surya, Aryama, Tvashta, Savita, Bhaga, Dhata, Vidhata, Varuna, Mitra, Indra and Vishnu (in the form of Vamanadeva).\n\n"}

The New Model Army garrison in Winchester was reinforced shortly before the uprising so plans to attack it were abandoned. No men answered the call in Cheshire, but risings did take place in the other places. However, at all of the locations except Salisbury, the Royalists disbanded without a fight due to lack of support.\n\nThe York uprising, the rendezvous point for which was on Marston Moor, was notable for the presence of the Earl of Rochester who had travelled from the exiled court of Charles II to take part. The rising was put down by Colonel Robert Lilburne, Governor of York, and on its failure Rochester fled the country.\n\nColonel John Penruddock along with Sir Joseph Wagstaffe organised and led the Royalist uprising in the West. On 11 March Penruddock, with between 300 and 400 other Cavaliers, took Salisbury and raised the Royal standard. The next morning he led his followers out of Salisbury, heading west through Blandford, Sherborne and Yeovil in the hope of picking up more supporters, but a single troop of horse of the New Model Army under Captain Unton Crook defeated them after a three-hour street fight in South Molton in Devon on 14 March. Most of the Royalists either fled or were killed but Crook captured Penruddock and the other ringleaders.\n\nOliver Cromwell appointed the judge Sir Hugh Wyndham to the commission of oyer and terminer charged with dealing with the Penruddock uprising.\n\nTrials of the leading insurgents for high treason were held at Exeter on 18 April 1655. The first was against Penruddock, Hugh Grove, Richard Reeves of Kimpton, gent, brothers Robert and George Duke of Stuckton, gents, Francis Jones of Beddington, gent, Francis Bennett of Killington, gent, Thomas Fitzjames of Hanley, gent, Edward Davy of London, gent, and Thomas Poulton of Pewsey, innkeeper, all of whom were convicted except Bennett. The second bill named Edward Willis, innkeeper of New Sarum, Nicholas Mussell of Steeple Langford, yeoman, William Jenkins of Fordingbridge, gent, Thomas Hillard of Upton, yeoman, William Stroud of Wincanton, gent, Robert Harris of Stanford, cordwainer, John Bibby of Compton Chamberlain, gent, and John Cooke of Potterne, along with John Haynes, \"the Sherriffe of Wilts' trumpeter who went along from Salisbury\". All were found guilty, Jenkins having pleaded guilty.\n\nThe third bill named four men who claimed they had received articles of surrender from Captain Crooke: brothers Henry and Joseph Collier of Steeple Langford, William Wake of Blandford, gent (the father of future Archbishop William Wake), and Christopher Haviland of Longton, labourer. It was argued that they had instead simply been promised \"fair quarter\", upon which they confessed the indictment. Also arraigned were James Horsington, gent and John Giles, yeoman, of New Sarum, who it was claimed had been held in Salisbury jail for robbery and had been freed by the insurgents, Abraham Wilson, cutler, Richard Browne, Nicholas Broadgate of Blandford Forum, yeoman, and another trumpeter, a Dutchman called Hans Styver. Broadgate was acquitted, and the rest found guilty. A further man, Marcellus Rivers, gentleman, of Benstead, received a \"no true bill\" verdict. Sir William Clarke commented that although Grove, a gentleman with an annual income of 400 pounds, was a \"dareing and resolute person\", the most unrepentant were Reeves and Hilliard, \"the most ancient of them\", who openly admitted their actions and said that \"they owed not obedience but to Charles Stuart\".\n\nTen men (Penruddock, Groves, Reeves, Davy, Poulton, Willis, Hillard, Haynes, Horsington, and Giles) were executed at Exeter - Cromwell commuted the usual sentence to beheading in the case of Penruddock and Groves, and hanging in the case of the remainder. The others, including those claiming to have been given articles by Crooke, were said to have been reprieved and pardoned, such as Wake, who after a time in Exeter jail was released and went on to live until 1705.\n\nUp to seventy insurgents still held in Salisbury, of a range of social classes and occupations, were subsequently transported to Barbados as indentured labours. They were transported aboard the \"John of London\" to be sold for fifteen hundred and fifty pounds of sugar each. They arrived in Barbados on the 7 May 1656, where they were sold as the goods and chattels of Martin Noell, MP, Major Thomas Alderne of London, and Captain Henry Hatsell of Plymouth. The prisoners included the previously-acquitted Nicholas Broadgate and Marcellus Rivers, who along with another transportee called Oxenbridge Foyle or Fowell, was in 1659 was to submit a petition to Parliament in pamphlet form complaining about the prisoners' barbaric treatment at the hands of the planters who had bought them. Rivers added that one man, a Mr. Diamond of Tiverton - probably the William Deyman of Tiverton, gent, recorded as a prisoner at Exeter with Penruddock - had been transported despite being 76 years old and merely having expressed a wish to join the rebels. Although it is unknown whether Foyle returned to England, Rivers certainly returned at the Restoration, submitting a further petition that Martin Noell as being responsible for his deportation should be excluded from the general amnesty extended to Parliamentarians.\n\n\n"}

Brooks as Brooks attacked Massachusetts abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner in the Senate chamber with a cane, although he was not one of the members that the House tried to censure after the incident.\n\nBefore the start of the Civil War, Barksdale inadvertently helped stop one of the most notorious incidents of violence in U.S. legislative history. On February 5, 1858, a brawl between pro and anti-slavery legislators started on the House floor. During the melee, Barksdale swung at Illinois congressman Elihu Washburne, and Washburne's brother Cadwallader, who was a congressman from Wisconsin, grabbed at Barskdale such that it knocked his wig off, and an embarrassed Barksdale put it back on backwards, causing both sides to break out laughing and stopping the fight.\n\nAfter the state of Mississippi seceded just before the start of the Civil War, Barksdale resigned from Congress to become adjutant general, and then quartermaster general, of the Mississippi Militia, at the rank of brigadier general, with date of rank March 1, 1861. On May 1, he was appointed colonel in the Confederate States Army of the 13th Mississippi Infantry, a regiment that he led in the First Battle of Bull Run that summer, and the Battle of Ball's Bluff in October. The following spring, he took his regiment to the Virginia Peninsula and fought in the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles. When his brigade commander, Brig. Gen. Richard Griffith, was mortally wounded at the Battle of Savage's Station on June 29, 1862, Barksdale assumed command of the brigade and led it in an heroic, but bloody and futile, charge at the Battle of Malvern Hill. The brigade became known as \"Barksdale's Mississippi Brigade.\" He was promoted to brigadier general on August 12, 1862.\n\nIn the Northern Virginia Campaign, Barksdale's Brigade was stationed at Harpers Ferry, and thus did not participate in the Second Battle of Bull Run. In the Maryland Campaign, his brigade was assigned to the division of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws in Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia. It was one of the brigades that attacked Maryland Heights, leading to the surrender of the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry. At the subsequent Battle of Antietam, McLaws's Division defended the West Woods against the assault by Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick's division, saving the Confederate left flank. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, Barksdale's Brigade defended the waterfront of the city from Union forces attempting to cross the Rappahannock River, sniping at infantry and engineer forces from buildings that had been turned into rubble by Union artillery.\nAt the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Barksdale's Brigade was one of the few units in James Longstreet's Corps that was present at the battle; most of the corps was detached for duty in Suffolk, Virginia. Once again, Barksdale's brigade defended the heights above Fredericksburg, this time against his previous adversary, Sedgwick, whose VI Corps was over ten times the size of his brigade. Sedgwick's assault was successful and Barksdale pulled back after delaying the Union force, but he was able to rally his brigade and retake the lost ground the next day.\n\nAt the Battle of Gettysburg, Barksdale's Brigade arrived with McLaws's Division after the first day of battle, July 1, 1863. The plan from General Robert E. Lee was for Longstreet's Corps to maneuver into position and attack northeast, up the Emmitsburg Road, to roll up the Union left flank. Barksdale's sector of the attack placed him directly at the tip of the salient in the Union line anchored at the Peach Orchard, defended by the Union III Corps. At about 5:30 p.m., Barksdale's Brigade burst from the woods and started an irresistible assault, which has been described as one of the most breathtaking spectacles of the Civil War. A Union colonel was quoted as saying, \"It was the grandest charge that was ever made by mortal man.\" Although he ordered his subordinate commanders to walk during the charge, Barksdale himself rode on horseback \"in front, leading the way, hat off, his wispy hair shining so that it reminded [a Confederate staff officer] of 'the white plume of Navarre'.\"\n\nThe Confederates smashed the brigade manning the Peach Orchard line, wounding and capturing the Union brigade commander himself. Some of Barksdale's regiments turned to the north and shattered Maj. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys's division. Others of his regiments went straight ahead. By the time his men had gone as far as Plum Run, a mile into the assault, they were counterattacked by a brigade under Colonel George L. Willard. Barksdale was wounded in his left knee, followed by a cannonball to his left foot, and finally was hit by another bullet to his chest, knocking him off his horse. He told his aide, W.R. Boyd, \"I am killed! Tell my wife and children that I died fighting at my post.\" His troops were forced to leave him for dead on the field and he died the next morning in a Union field hospital (the Joseph Hummelbaugh farmhouse).\n\nBarksdale's remains were interred in the Barksdale family plot of Greenwood Cemetery, Jackson, Mississippi with no marker, but he has cenotaphs in both Greenwood Cemetery and in Friendship Cemetery, Columbus, Mississippi.\n\nBarksdale is portrayed in the film \"Gettysburg\" and in the prequel, \"Gods and Generals\", by Lester Kinsolving, who is a relative of Barksdale.\n\nBarksdale is also featured in the 2011 History Channel film \"Gettysburg\".\n\nThe streets in the Potomac Crossing subdivision in Leesburg, Virginia, are named (in part) after the regimental commanders of the Battle of Ball's Bluff (October 21, 1861). Barksdale Drive was named for Col. Barksdale and is the primary east-west conduit in the development, running just short of a mile to either end of the neighborhood.\n\n\n"}

The population of the town is 186,116 (2014 estimate).\n\nÇanakkale is the finishing point every year for an organised swim across the Dardanelles from Eceabat. This event emulates the swim in 1810 by Lord Byron, who was himself emulating the legendary swim by Leander in the story of Hero and Leander.\n\nThe city is the nearest major town to the site of ancient Troy. The wooden horse from the 2004 movie \"Troy\" is exhibited on the seafront.\n\nÇanakkale is the name for a site earlier known as Kale-I-Sultaniye, which was adopted as the official term for the town in 1890, though current a century earlier.\nÇanakkale was an Ottoman fortress called \"Kale-i Sultaniye\" () or \"Sultaniye kalesi\" (Fortress of the Sultan). From the late 17th century it also became known for its fine-glazed pottery, Çanakkale ceramics, compared by one traveler to Delftware hence the later name \"Çanak kalesi\" 'pot fortress'. The Greek Byzantine name for Çanakkale چینک قله was Δαρδανέλλια, \"Dardanellia\", from which the English name Dardanelles is derived.\n\nFrom around 1920, the British began to call Çanakkale Chanak and Kale Sultanie in their reporting.\n\nAncient Abydos, where the story of Hero and Leander takes place, is to the north of Çanakkale.\n\nThe first inhabitants of the area, which hosted many civilizations, lived on the Biga Peninsula in the Last Chalcolithic Age c. 6000 years ago. However, very little is known about the identity and lifestyle of these early settlers. According to some excavations and research, the earliest settlements in the region were established at Kumtepe. It is supposed that Kumkale was established in 4000 BC and Troy between 3500–3000 BC.\n\nAeolian Greeks settled on the land in the 8th century BC and established trade colonies in the region called Aeolis. The region came under the control of the Lydians in the 7th century BC and under the control of the Persians in the 6th century BC. Aeolis went under the control of the Ancient Macedonian army as Alexander the Great defeated the Persians by the Granicus River of the region in the Battle of the Granicus on his way to Asia. The region came under the reign of the Kingdom of Pergamon in the 2nd century BC.\n\nÇanakkale itself was built as a fortress in 1462 by Mehmed II Fatih, who gave it the name Kale-I Sultaniye, since one of the Sultan's sons had collaborated in its construction. Sited on a bay at the narrowest point of the strait, it, together with another nearby fort, Kilid Bahr, provided an excellent position for controlling traffic through the Dardanelles. The two forts were quickly called in the travel literature \"The Castles\", and a town developed to the north-east, settled by Armenian refugees and Spanish Jews.\n\nFrom the Renaissance period onwards, after their expulsion from Spain, Jewish refugees settled in Çanakkale and formed a sizeable community which thrived by supplying Mediterranean shipping in the region with provisions and acting as consular agents for many European nations. Down to the late 19th century they retained Spanish as a mother-tongue. Some 1,805 Jews were registered there in 1890, out of a population of 10,862, the rest being Muslims (3,551), Orthodox Greeks (2,577), Armenians (956) and assorted foreigners (2,173).,\n\nThe western part of the Biga Peninsula where ancient Troy is situated was called Troas. Alexandria Troas, an important settlement of the region, was a free trade port and a rich trade center during Roman times. Later in the 2nd century AD, the region was attacked by Goths from Thrace. During the 7th and 8th centuries, in order to attack Constantinople the Arabs passed the strait a few times and came up to Sestos. At the beginning of the 14th century the Karasids dominated the Anatolian part of the strait. During the first half of that century Demirhan Bey from Karasids attempted to dominate the region. The Ottomans gained control of Gallipoli in 1367.\n\nIn 1915, during the First World War, British Empire and France attempted to secure the waterway through the Straits and ultimately capture Constantinople. Known as The Gallipoli Campaign, or the Dardanelles Campaign, in Turkey it is referred to as the Battle of Çanakkale (), during March 1915 when the Royal Navy failed to force the Dardanelles and suffered severe losses. During a series of operations, \"HMS Triumph\", \"HMS Ocean\", \"HMS Goliath\", \"HMS Irresistible\" and the French battleship \"Bouvet\" were all sunk. The French submarine Q84 \"Joule\" and the Australian submarine \"AE2\" were also destroyed and several other important ships were crippled too. Most of the damage was inflicted by mines, though a German U-Boat and Turkish small craft contributed too.\n\nAs of 1920, the city was estimated to have a population of approximately 22,000. An active port city, it was a stopping point for vessels traveling through the strait, as it had been in the ancient past. It was described as lacking quality accommodations and resources for those passing through by the British who visited the region. Exported goods from the city included wine, hides, pottery, ceramic tiles and grain.\n\n\nThe service of education throughout the city is above the country average. There are 13 high schools and a college within the boundaries of the city. Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University has 12 faculties, 4 institutes, 9 4-year colleges, 14 vocational schools and serves more than 52,000 students in the all area. 30 percent of the city population are college graduates.\n\nÇanakkale has one airport, which is 3 km from the city centre, serving since 1995. Anadolu Jet, a trademark of Turkish Airlines, and Borajet have daily flights from Istanbul and Ankara.\n\nÇanakkale is linked to north, east, and south by paved highways. Buses run to Istanbul and Izmir.\n\nÇanakkale has a mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and cool and rainy winters. Snow falls ordinarily every winter.\n\n\n\n"}

Kershaw\n\nJoseph Brevard Kershaw (January 5, 1822 – April 13, 1894) was a lawyer, judge, and a Confederate general in the American Civil War.\n\nKershaw, the scion of plantation aristocracy, was born at the family plantation east of the town center in Camden, Kershaw County, South Carolina in 1822, admitted to the bar in 1843, married Lucretia Ann Douglas in Camden in 1844, and was a member of the South Carolina Senate in 1852–1856. Kershaw saw battle during the Mexican–American War, but fell dangerously sick and was permitted to return home.\n\nAt the start of the Civil War, Kershaw commanded the 2nd South Carolina Infantry Regiment. He was present at Morris Island in April 1861 during the Battle of Fort Sumter, and then in July 1861 at the First Battle of Manassas in Virginia as part of Brig. Gen. Milledge Bonham's brigade. During the battle, Kershaw's regiment along with the 8th South Carolina was detached from Bonham and sent to help drive back the Union assault on Henry House Hill.\n\nAfterwards, Kershaw gained the ire of Confederate general P.G.T. Beauregard by failing to file a proper report of the battle and instead writing a lengthy article in a Charleston newspaper which gave the impression that he and the 2nd South Carolina singlehandedly defeated the Union army. Beauregard, who had difficult professional relationships with many military and political officials, called him \"that militia idiot\". The disparaging remarks of Beauregard toward himself and other officers were duly noted. The capable and competent Kershaw had filed a military report of the battle, while the purpose of the newspaper article was to aid recruitment of South Carolina soldiers by showing how a single man, company or brigade could make a significant difference and lead the way to Confederate victory.\n\nDue in part to his military success, Kershaw was transferred to the West in the fall. In December when Milledge Bonham resigned his commission to take a seat in the Confederate Congress, Kershaw was honored with command of Bonham's former brigade.\n\nHe was commissioned brigadier general on 13 February 1862 and commanded a brigade in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia during the Peninsula Campaign, at the close of which he continued with Lee and took part in the Northern Virginia Campaign and Maryland Campaign. During the Battle of Fredericksburg, he succeeded Brig. Gen. T. R. R. Cobb upon the latter's death on 13 December 1862 and repulsed the last two attacks made by the Federals on Marye's Heights.\n\nThe following year he was engaged in the Battle of Gettysburg and then was transferred with Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's corps to the West, where he took part in the charge that destroyed the Federal right wing at Chickamauga. After the relief of McLaws following the battle of Knoxville Kershaw was given the command of the division and promoted to major general on 2 June 1864. When Longstreet returned to Virginia, he commanded a division in the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, and Cold Harbor, and was engaged in the Shenandoah campaign of 1864 against Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan. After the evacuation of Richmond, his troops formed part of Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's corps, which was captured on 6 April 1865 at the Battle of Sayler's Creek.\n\nAt the close of the war he returned to South Carolina and in 1865 was chosen president of the State Senate. He was judge of the Circuit Court from 1877 to 1893, when he stepped down for health reasons. In 1894, he was appointed postmaster of Camden, an office that he held until his death in the same year. Joseph B. Kershaw was also Grand Master of the Freemasons of South Carolina. He died in Camden and is buried there in the Quaker Cemetery.\n\nJoseph Brevard Kershaw (5 January 1822 Camden – 13 April 1894 Camden) married in 1844 in Camden to Lucretia Ann Douglas (27 August 1825 Camden, Kershaw County, South Carolina, USA - 28 April 1902 Camden), youngest of the four surviving daughters of the esteemed James Kennedy Douglas (23 October 1780 Minnigaff, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland - 13 November 1860 Camden) by his wife Mary Lucretia Martin (21 February 1785 - 29 March 1852 Camden). James, son of William Douglas and his wife Sarah Kennedy, had emigrated in 1800/1804 to join John Kirkpatrick, an established merchant in Charleston, South Carolina.

{"id": "1871647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871647", "title": "St Patrick's Purgatory", "text": "St Patrick's Purgatory\n\nSt Patrick's Purgatory is an ancient pilgrimage site on Station Island in Lough Derg, County Donegal, Ireland. According to legend, the site dates from the fifth century, when Christ showed Saint Patrick a cave, sometimes referred to as a pit or a well, on Station Island that was an entrance to Purgatory.\nIts importance in medieval times is clear from the fact that it is mentioned in texts from as early as 1185 and shown on maps from all over Europe as early as the fifteenth century. It is the only Irish site designated on Martin Behaim's world map of 1492.\n\nIn the nineteenth century there was some confusion about the actual site of St Patrick's Purgatory—whether it was on Station Island or Saints Island on Lough Derg, County Donegal. For instance the early nineteenth-century Ordnance Survey maps of Ireland (1837–42) locate the Purgatory on Saints Island. However, its location on Station Island is a tradition that continues unbroken from the Middle Ages. It is clearly indicated on documents dating from that time, and it appears as \"Caverna Purgatory\" on the detailed of Station Island in Fr. Thomas Carve's book, \"Lyra Hibernica\" (1666).\n\nLegend maintains that St. Patrick had grown discouraged by the doubts of his potential converts, who told him they would not believe his teachings until they had substantial proof. St. Patrick prayed that God would help him relate the Word of God and convert the Irish people, and in return, God revealed to him a pit in the ground, which he called Purgatory; by showing this place to the people, they would believe all that he said. By witnessing Purgatory, the people would finally know the reality of the joys of heaven and the torments of hell.\n\nGiven the sparsity of any documentation for fifth-century Ireland, it is not surprising that there is no proof that St. Patrick ever visited Lough Derg. And while this is the legend, it is a rather late legend dating probably from the twelfth century. There is however a much more firmly established tradition regarding St. Dabheog or Dabheoc, a local abbot who presided over, and possibly established, the monastery on the site during the lifetime of Patrick. His name has been associated from these early centuries with several places in the area, for instance: St. Dabheoc's Chair on the south bank of Lough Derg, the townland of Seedavoc (St. Dabheoc's Seat), and a mountain in that townland, Seavadog Mountain. One of the islands in Lough Derg was also named after him: St. Dabheoc's Island, which may have been Saints Island or another island entirely.\n\nAlthough the cave has been closed since 25 October 1632, several descriptions by early pilgrims survive. They referred to it as a cave or cellar or as an enclosed pit. The entrance, which was kept closed and locked, was quite narrow: about 0.6 m (2 ft) wide and 0.9 m (3 ft) high. Once inside there was a short descent of about six steps. The cave was divided into two parts: the first was about 3 m (9 ft) long, probably with banked sides and only high enough to kneel in; after a turn there was another niche about 1.5 m (5 ft) long.\n\nSince the site has never been excavated, we can only rely at this point on these descriptions of the cave. However based on other archaeological excavations it seems clear that this was probably an ancient structure. Some have suggested a souterrain, a place for storing crops and animals. However, the size of the cave would make this seem very unlikely. A much more plausible suggestion is that it was one of the ancient sweat houses, which were actually still in use in Ireland into the twentieth century. From modern practice we know that people would enter these small enclosed places to inhale medicinal smoke produced by burning various plants. The name \"purgatorium\" could possibly have been used here originally with its Latin meaning as a place for cleansing and purging—much like a modern sauna; especially since the modern notion of \"purgatory\" as a place for punishment in the afterlife did not come into common use until the thirteenth century. The cave would then have been a place that people went to for physical or spiritual healing, even before it became associated with St. Patrick in the twelfth century as a place for strictly spiritual healing.\n\nA monastery probably existed on the islands in Lough Derg from the fifth century and it probably included anchorites who lived in beehive cells—which may be preserved in some form in the penitential beds that can still be seen on Station Island.\n\nAround 1130 the monastery was given to Augustinian Canons Regular by the authority of the cathedral in Armagh, under Saint Malachy. The monastery on Saints Island offered hospitality to pilgrims, who would visit in a spirit of penance and prayer. It also served as a place where pilgrims could prepare themselves for visiting the Purgatory. Documents report that pilgrims who did want to visit the Purgatory would arrive with letters of permission from a bishop, either from their own region or from Armagh. They would then spend fifteen days fasting and praying to prepare themselves for the visit to Station Island, a short boat ride away. At the end of the fifteen days, pilgrims would confess their sins, receive communion and undergo a few final rituals before being locked in the cave for twenty-four hours. The next morning the prior would open the door, and if the pilgrim were found alive, he would be brought back to Saints Island for another fifteen days of prayer and fasting.\n\nFrom the time of St. Dabheoc, it appears that this region attracted pilgrims from far and wide. By the twelfth century they came from all over continental Europe, most likely sailing from England and landing at Dublin or Drogheda. From those ports they would make their way by foot, stopping at monasteries along the way on what would probably be a two-week journey across the Irish countryside to their destination. In this period many sinners and criminals were sent on pilgrimage to atone for their deeds and seek forgiveness. St. Patrick's Purgatory would be a likely destination for these penitential pilgrims, or exiles, since communities of anchorites were often considered to have special power to absolve them.\n\nBased on the description left by the fifteenth-century pilgrim, Guillebert of Lannoy, it is possible to trace the medieval pilgrimage route, reported in 1430, from Drogheda to Kells along the Boyne River, most likely stopping at Mellifont, Slane and Donaghmore, staying at monasteries, as was the usual custom for medieval travelers of any type. From there he headed northwest toward Enniskillen, which he calls Rousseaumoustier. Here a duke lends him a boat so that he and his companions could travel up Lough Erne, most likely stopping at Devenish, Inishmacsaint and White Island. Along this route he would have also passed by the important monastery of Drumlane.\n\nAt the 31st Irish Conference of Medievalists (2017) it has been presented a new hypothesis for the historical reconstruction of the so-called first \"closure\" of the pilgrimage which is thought to have occurred in the late 15th century. The \"Acta Sanctorum\" contains a document in which the closure is attributed to the denunciation of a Dutch monk, who had been to Lough Derg and subsequently traveled to the Vatican, where he accused the pilgrimage's organizers (including the bishop and the prior) of simony. According to P. Taviani that document is a fake, forged by someone who never had been to Lough Derg and who imagined St. Patrick Purgatory to be akin to St Patrick's Well in Orvieto (Italy). The Pope would never have ordered the closure of the pilgrimage, and in fact this never happened. The true story is that in 1497 it was Cathal Óg Mac Maghnusa (at the time active as a bishop of the Diocese of Clogher), encouraged by the Guardian of the Franciscan Observant Donegal Abbey, who wanted to radically change the course of the pilgrimage. The promise of a journey to the underworld could no longer be sustained. To ensure the survival of the pilgrimage, it was necessary to turn it into an event purely concerned with penitence. In order to overcome any potential opposition to this radical change, a fictitious Papal order was conceived..\nThe monastery was then dissolved in 1632, although the local lord apparently allowed the monks to remain. By 1710 the Franciscans were present on the island in the summer to administer to the needs of the pilgrims. They built a church, St. Mary of the Angels, on Station Island in 1763. In 1785, administration of Station Island came into the hands of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clogher. Shane Leslie gave freehold of the island to the diocese in 1960, and was made a Knight Commander of St Gregory by Pope John XXIII in recognition.\n\nThere is no evidence that the pilgrimage to St. Patrick's Purgatory was ever interrupted for any period of time. It continues even today, after almost fifteen hundred years. Every year the main pilgrimage season begins in late May/early June and ends mid-August, on the 15th, the feast of the Assumption of Mary. It is a three-day pilgrimage open to pilgrims of all religions, or none, who must be at least fifteen years of age, in good health and able to walk and kneel unaided. Pilgrims, who should begin fasting at the previous midnight, assemble at the Visitor Centre on the shore of Lough Derg early in the day (between about 10 am and 1 pm). From there a boat ferries them on the brief trip out to Station Island. Once on the island they are assigned a dormitory room, and barefoot they begin a specified and almost continuous cycle of prayer and liturgies.\n\nThese prayers — the Our Father (or Lord's Prayer), the Hail Mary and the Apostles' Creed (all included in a booklet they receive)— are carried out at designated 'stations' on the island, including six 'beds' that are the remains of ancient cells or beehive huts, named for famous – principally Irish – saints. These are thought to be the remains of early monastic cells.\n\nPilgrims spend the first night in the island's basilica in prayer, and only on the second night can they finally sleep in the dormitory. Each day on the island the pilgrims have one simple meal of dry toast, oatcakes and black tea or coffee. On the third morning they are ferried back to the mainland, where they will continue their fast until midnight.\n\nThere are also other programs throughout the year, including Quiet Days, Family Days, and One-Day Retreats.\n\nThe site is under the stewardship of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clogher. The staff includes people who can help with both spiritual and practical concerns. Facilities include a kitchen, laundry, first-aid station and book/gift shop.\n\n\"Tractatus de Purgatorio Sancti Patricii\" is a twelfth-century account in Latin of a pilgrimage to St Patrick's Purgatory. Marie de France translated it into French and expanded it into the \"Legend of the Purgatory of St. Patrick\".\n\nOther medieval works include The Knight of Hungary, or George Grissophan, Provençal, mid-fourteenth century; the Vision of Louis of France \"(Visio Ludovici de Francia),\" French, 1358; the Vision of Ramon de Perellós, 1397; The Vision of William Staunton, English, after 1409; and the Vision of Laurent Rathold de Pasztho, 1411. A fascinating account of a visit to Lough Derg by Catalan pilgrim Ramon de Perellós in 1397 is given in Haren and de Pontfarcy's book., along with several other pilgrims' accounts.\n\n\"Station Island\" is a long poem written by Séamus Heaney about his experience of the pilgrimage. Other well-known poets, such as Denis Devlin and Patrick Kavanagh wrote works on St. Patrick's Purgatory as well. \"The Lough Derg Pilgrim\" by the Irish writer William Carleton recounts his experience there, which led him to abandon thoughts of becoming a Roman Catholic priest; he converted to the Church of Ireland. Pete McCarthy's visit in 1998 is described in \"McCarthy's Bar\".\n\n\"Froissart's Chronicles\" mentions it in Book Four, Froissart Revisits England.\n\nRabelais's Gargantua bawdily refers to it as \"Saint Patrick's hole\".\n\n'The Pilgrim', by William Butler Yeats is centred on the pilgrimage to Station Island.\n\nSince the records were destroyed in 1632, we have no way of knowing exactly how many people made the pilgrimage each year in those days. However, since that time, records are available; and we know, for example, that in 1700, 5,000 pilgrims were recorded for the season; by 1826 the number of pilgrims grew to 15,000, and to 30,000 by 1846, just before the onset of the Great Famine. From 1871 to 1903 approximately 3,000 pilgrims visited annually; and from 1908 to 1921, the number averaged over 8,000. From 1929 to the end of the century the number never fell below 10,000 pilgrims, and in many years was twice, and sometimes thrice, that number. In 2011, 8,000 people completed the pilgrimage.\n\nNotable pilgrims include:\n\nThere are thirty-three pilgrims to St. Patrick's Purgatory between c. 1146 and 1517 who can be identified by name. Thirty-two are listed in Haren and de Pontfarcy; Francesco Chiericati saw the name of the 33rd, Guarino da Durazzo, in a book on Station Island during his visit, before all of the records on St. Patrick's Purgatory were presumably destroyed on 25 October 1632.\n\n\n"}

Benning\n\nHenry Lewis Benning (April 2, 1814 – July 10, 1875) was a general in the Confederate States Army. He also was a lawyer, legislator, and judge on the Georgia Supreme Court. He commanded the \"Benning's Brigade\" during the American Civil War. Following the Confederacy's defeat at the end of the war, he returned to his native Georgia, where he lived out the rest of his life. Fort Benning, Georgia, home of the Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE) is named after him.\n\nBenning was born on a plantation in Columbia County, Georgia, the son of Pleasant Moon and Malinda Meriwether White Benning, the third of eleven children. He attended Franklin College (now the University of Georgia), graduating in 1834. While a student, he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society. After college, he moved to Columbus, Georgia, which would be his home for the rest of his life. He was admitted to the bar at the age of 21.\n\nBenning was active in Southern U.S. politics and an ardent secessionist, bitterly opposing abolition and the emancipation of slaves. In a letter to Howell Cobb written in July 1849, he stated that a Southern Confederacy would not be enough—because a Confederacy might itself eventually become divided into northern and southern regions as slavery waned in some of the states—and called for a Southern \"consolidated Republic\" that \"will put slavery under the control of those most interested in it.\"\n\nIn 1851 he was nominated for the U.S. Congress as a Southern rights Democrat, but was not elected. In 1853 he was elected an associate justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, where he was noted for an opinion that held that a state supreme court is not bound by the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States on constitutional questions, but that the two courts must be held to be \"coordinate and co-equal\".\n\nFollowing the election of Abraham Lincoln to the U.S. presidency in 1860 on a platform opposing the expansion of slavery into U.S. territories, Benning took an active part in the state convention that voted to secede from the Union, representing Muscogee County. In March 1861, the southern slave states that had seceded appointed special commissioners to travel to those other slaveholding Southern states that had yet to secede. Benning was the commissioner from Georgia to the Virginian secession convention, where he tried to persuade Virginian politicians to vote to join Georgia in seceding from the Union. In a February 1861 speech to the Virginian secession convention, Benning gave his reasoning for the urging of secession from the Union, appealing to ethnic prejudices and pro-slavery sentiments to present his case, saying that were the slave states to remain in the Union their slaves would ultimately end up being freed by the anti-slavery Republican Party. He stated that he would rather be stricken with illness and starvation than see African Americans liberated from slavery and be given equality as citizens:\n\nAlthough he was considered for a cabinet position in the government of the newly established Confederacy, he chose to join the Confederate army instead and became the colonel of the 17th Georgia Infantry, a regiment he raised himself in Columbus on August 29, 1861. The regiment became part of Toombs's Brigade in the Right Wing of the Army of Northern Virginia, under General Robert E. Lee.\n\nAs a newly minted army officer, Benning immediately ran into political difficulty. He questioned the legality of the Confederate government's Conscription Act and spoke against it openly as a violation of states' rights. Refusing to obey certain orders, he came close to being court-martialed, but influence from his friend, Colonel T. R. R. Cobb, defused the situation. The first significant action he saw was at the Second Battle of Bull Run in August 1862. At the Battle of Antietam, Benning's brigade was a crucial part in the defense of the Confederate right flank, guarding \"Burnside's Bridge\" across Antietam Creek all morning against repeated Union assaults. His courage in battle was no longer questioned by his superiors, and he became known as the \"Old Rock\" to his men. He was promoted to brigadier general on April 23, 1863, with date of rank of January 17, 1863.\n\nFor most of the rest of the war, Benning continued as a brigade commander (\"Benning's Brigade\") in the division of the aggressive John Bell Hood of Texas. He missed the Confederate victory at the Battle of Chancellorsville because his brigade was stationed in southern Virginia along with the rest of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps. However, they returned for active combat in the Battle of Gettysburg. There, on July 2, 1863, Benning led his brigade in a furious assault against the Union position in the Devil's Den, driving out the defenders at no small cost to themselves. That September, Longstreet's Corps was sent west to assist General Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee. On the second day of the bloody Battle of Chickamauga, Benning participated in Longstreet's massive charge against a gap in the Union line, even as his horse was shot out from under him. He mounted another horse, which was also killed. Finally, he cut loose a horse from a nearby artillery battery and rode into combat bareback. During a surprise Union counter-attack against his brigade, many of his men fled and Benning ran off to Longstreet to report the calamity. Riding an old artillery horse and whipping it with a piece of rope, Benning was \"greatly excited and the very picture of despair,\" as reported by Longstreet after the war. Benning said, \"General, I am ruined; my brigade was suddenly attacked and every man killed; not one is to be found. Please give me orders where I can do some fighting.\" Longstreet responded impassively, \"Nonsense, General, you are not so badly hurt. Look about you. I know you will find at least one man, and with him on his feet report your brigade to me, and you two shall have a place in the fighting line.\" Longstreet's reply humiliated Benning, but instilled enough determination in him to return to find his brigade and prevail in the battle.\n\nThe Benning's Brigade fought at the Battle of Wauhatchie outside Chattanooga, Tennessee, and joined Longstreet's Corps in its unsuccessful Knoxville Campaign in late 1863. Returning to Virginia, the brigade fought against Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in the 1864 Overland Campaign, where Benning was severely wounded in the left shoulder during the Battle of the Wilderness on May 5. This wound kept him out of the remainder of the campaign and much of the subsequent Siege of Petersburg, but he was able to return in time for the waning days of that lengthy campaign. His brigade withstood strong Union assaults against its entrenchments, but was forced to withdraw along with the rest of Lee's army in the retreat to Appomattox Court House in early April 1865. Benning, heartbroken, was one of the final officers to lead his men to the surrender ceremony.\n\nAfter the war, Benning returned to Columbus to resume the practice of law. He found that his house had been burned and that all of his savings had disappeared, and that he had to support, along with his own family, the widow and children of his wife's brother who had been killed in the war.\n\nIn 1875, Benning had a stroke, termed apoplexy at the time, on his way to court and died in Columbus. He is buried in Linwood Cemetery.\n\nOn September 12, 1839, Benning married Mary Howard Jones of Columbus, Georgia. Mary was the daughter of the Honorable Seaborn Jones, a prominent attorney, former Georgia Secretary of State, and United States Representative. Henry and Mary were married for twenty-nine years. Years before Margaret Mitchell published her Civil War novel, \"Gone with the Wind\", she wrote an article in the \"Atlanta Constitution\" (December 20, 1925) in which she referenced the Benning family and their experiences during the war.\n\nRegarding Mary Benning, Ms. Mitchell wrote, \"She was a tiny woman, frail and slight, but possessed of unusual endurance and a lion’s heart. The battles she fought at home were those of nearly every Southern woman, but her burdens were heavier than most. Left in complete charge of a large plantation, this little woman, who was the mother of ten children, was as brave a soldier at home as ever her husband was on the Virginia battlefields. She saw to it that the crops were gathered, the children fed and clothed, and the Negroes cared for. To her fell the work of superintending the weaving and spinning of enough cloth, not only to clothe her own children and servants, but also Confederate soldiers. While her husband was away she buried her aged father, whose end was hastened by the war.\"\n\nFollowing her research and article on the Bennings, Mitchell wrote her novel of the Civil War, and many of her descriptions of the Bennings are reflected in the lives of the O'Haras and others.\n\nShortly after the Civil War, Mary Benning died suddenly on June 28, 1868. Henry's firstborn son, Seaborn Jones Benning, died of consumption on December 12, 1874. Henry Benning suffered a stroke and died on July 10, 1875. The couple had a total of ten children, including an infant son who died within hours of birth and three daughters (Sarah Elizabeth, Caroline Matilda and Anna Malinda) who died of childhood diseases. Five Benning daughters (Mary Howard, Augusta Jones, Louisa Vivian, Anna Caroline, and Sarah Jones) survived their parents.\n\nWhile all of Benning's daughters were accomplished women, it is noteworthy that Louisa Vivian was married to Samuel Spencer. Spencer served as a young cavalryman during the Civil War and rode under the command of General Nathan Bedford Forrest. After the war, Spencer attained great prominence as a railroad tycoon, and he is known today as the \"Father of the Southern Railroad System.\" \n\nThe U.S. Army installation of Fort Benning is named after Benning. It is home to the U.S. Army Infantry School and is located near Columbus, Georgia. During World War II, a Liberty Ship was named in honor of Benning. The S.S. Henry L. Benning, United States Merchant Marine 0946, was built in Baltimore, Maryland and went into service on March 9, 1943. The ship hauled cargo and troops throughout the Pacific theater, but alas, there are only several Liberty Ships still in existence, and Benning's maritime namesake is no more. \n\n\n\n"}

The church here has been designated by the Vatican as one among the eight International shrines in the world. It is believed that St. Thomas held prayer at the place where church is situated when he landed in Kerala. The hilltop church is located 15 km away from the town of Kalady. Malayatoor and Kodanad villages are located on the opposite banks of the Periyar river with unspoiled and rustic views of the surroundings.\n\nSt. Thomas is believed to have landed at Kodungallur (Cranganore) in Kerala in AD 50. In AD 62, St. Thomas returns to Malankara coast via Malayatur where he establishes ‘the half church’ (a small Christian community dependant on the Church of Maliamkara).\n\nOral tradition says that while travelling through Malayattor, faced with hostile natives, he fled to the hilltop where he said to have remained in prayer and that he left his footprint on one of the rocks. According to beliefs, during prayer, he touched a rock, upon which blood poured from it.\n\nThe chief festival is on the first Sunday after Easter. It is traditionally believed that St. Thomas used to make the Sign of the Cross on the rock, kiss it and pray at \"Kurisumudi\". The story has it that a miraculous golden cross appeared at that particular spot. Pilgrims going up the hill to call out incessantly \"\"Ponnum Kurishu Muthappo, Ponmala Kayattom\"\", meaning \"<nowiki>\"</nowiki>O Patriarch of the Golden Cross! Climb we shall, this golden hill!<nowiki>\"</nowiki>\"\n\nThis Shrine was promoted to Archdiocesan status by Major Archbishop Mar Varkey Cardinal Vithayathil on 4 September 1998. There is also a very ancient Church in the name of St Thomas (Estd. 900) at Malayattoor on the bank of Periyar River which serves as the parish Church at present. The annual festival of this church is known as 'Malayatoor Perunal' and it is celebrated in the months of March–April.\n\nKurishumudi (Hill of the holy cross) is a mountain at Malayattoor, has its fame as a place visited by St. Thomas, one of the Apostles of Jesus Christ. Jesus gave a mandate to his Apostles to go out to the whole world and to proclaim the Good News. Thomas set out to India and landed at Kodungalloor in AD 52. A hostile reception was given and his life was in danger. He was forced to flee to the top of the mountain and had spent days in the abode of God. In deep anguish and agony, St. Thomas prayed to the Lord and he made a sign of the cross on the rock. The Mother of Our Lord, Blessed Mary, appeared to console and strengthens him. He descended from the top hill and continued his journey to Mylapoore in Tamil Nadu. Later on the hunters went to the mountain for hunting. While they stayed in the night they saw a glittering sign of cross on the rock. Out of curiosity they struck there with their rude weapons. To their surprise blood gushed out. They ran to the valley and told the locals. They went to the mountain and while they prayed there they got many miracles. This is the humble beginning of Pilgrimage to Kurishumudi\nKurishumudi is where one can find the Golden Cross believed to have formed when St. Thomas knelt on a rock and signed a cross with his finger. He remained there praying for a long time, and ultimately a golden cross appeared on the spot.\n\nOne of the most curious sights at the mountain was the permanent footprint and the marks of knees of St. Thomas imprinted on the rock. At present, the natural footprint is not there but instead there is a man-made footprint (A replica) made by the Church.\n\nAn ancient chapel at Kurishumudi, was attacked by tuskers in the past when it used to be surrounded by thick jungle. Deep tusk marks can still be found on the back wall of the chapel.\n\nA well, situated near the ancient chapel at the top of the mount is believed to be the spot from where St. Thomas quenched his thirst during his time of prayer. Feeling thirsty, he struck the rock from which fresh water started flowing. Pilgrims consider the water in the well to possess divine power to heal ailments.\n\nWith its recent recognition by Vatican as an international pilgrim centre, this famous shrine at Malayattoor dedicated to St. Thomas would be extending its healing touch and spiritual bliss to more visitors and for those who come to enjoy its serenity.\n\nSt. Thomas founded churches in different places in Kerala including Kollam, Kodungalloor, Nilakkal, Niranam, etc. One can easily seek spiritual happiness and satisfaction amidst the calm and serene locales surrounding Malayatoor. In fact, this center is the most popular and largest St. Thomas shrine in India. It is a popular tourist center and many people throng this place to have a look at this magnificent church. It is a must visit while traveling to Cochin.\n\nEvery year on the first Sunday after Easter, thousands of pilgrims throng to this shrine to seek holy blessings. The church has been decorated with beautiful carvings, designs and paintings that depict the life of Jesus Christ. There are facilities for confession and adoration also in this church. The church also has an ancient pond that was used for baptism purposes and a traditional pulpit that is considered to be of much historical significance.\n\nThere is a Holy Mass daily at 7:30 AM. On Sundays and Feast days there are two services - 7:30 AM and 9:30 AM.\n\nThe main feasts celebrated are:\n\n\nThe Cochin International Airport is at a distance of 15 kilometers from here.\n\nThe Angamaly railway station is at a distance of 17 kilometers from Malayattoor, but since most trains do not stop at Angamaly you can get down at the next railway station Aluva (Alwaye)as most of the trains halt there.\n\nMalayattoor Church is easily reachable from anywhere in Kerala and Cochin as the place is well connected by a wide network of roads.\nTo get to Malayatoor driving down on the NH47, one will have to take a diversion towards Kalady from Angamaly and drive all the way up to Kalady town which will take about 10 minutes. Then take a left towards Malayatoor. Folks driving down from Ernakulam / Cochin can drive up to Angamaly and take the same route or take the left towards Kalady after Cochin International Airport on the NH47. The latter route is shorter but the time taken will be a little more due to the small roads one will have to drive in.\n\nThere is a new bridge from Kodanad to Malayatoor which makes it easy for people coming from the eastern side like Kothamangalam, Munnar etc. They can take the turn at Kuruppampady towards Kodanad and reach Malayatoor in 20 minutes by car. People coming from Perumbavoor can take the Vallom - Kodanad road to access the same bridge to reach Malayatoor in less than 20 minutes.\n\n"}

Wright\n\nAmbrose Ransom Wright (April 26, 1826 – December 21, 1872) was a lawyer, Georgia politician, and Confederate general in the American Civil War.\n\nWright, known by the nickname \"Rans\", was born in Louisville, Georgia. He read law under the tutelage of Governor and Senator Herschel V. Johnson, who later became his brother-in-law, and was admitted to the bar. He became prominent politically, although he ran unsuccessfully for the Georgia legislature and for the United States Congress. He was a presidential elector for Millard Fillmore in 1856, a supporter of Bell and Everett in 1860, and a Georgia commissioner to Maryland in 1861.\n\nAt the start of the Civil War, Wright enlisted as a private in Georgia Militia, but he was commissioned colonel of the 3rd Georgia Infantry on May 18, 1861, and served in North Carolina and Georgia until the summer of 1862 and won a victory for the Confederacy at the Battle of South Mills in North Carolina in April 1862. In May, Wright traveled with his regiment to Virginia and fought in the Battle of Seven Pines as part of Brig. Gen Albert G. Blanchard's brigade. Blanchard was removed from command afterwards due to poor performance and Wright replaced him, being promoted to brigadier general.\n\nWright's Georgians made a distinguished record in the Army of Northern Virginia from the Seven Days Battles to the Siege of Petersburg. He was badly wounded at the Battle of Antietam in 1862 and at Chancellorsville in 1863.\n\nAt the Battle of Gettysburg, Wright's brigade, part of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division of Lt. Gen.

His command drove off the Union force and captured twenty artillery pieces, before being forced to retire through lack of support.\n\nAs of November 26, 1864, Wright was named major general on a temporary commission (which was not made permanent) and ordered to Georgia, where he exercised command until the end of the war.\n\nIn 1863, Wright had been elected to the Georgia state senate and president of that body \"in absentia\". Resuming his law practice after the termination of hostilities, he purchased the \"Augusta Chronicle & Sentinel\" newspaper in 1866, and, in 1871, was defeated for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate. The following year, General Wright was a delegate to both the state and national Democratic conventions and was elected to the United States House of Representatives, but died at Augusta, Georgia, before taking his seat. At a special election to fill the vacancy, Alexander Stephens was elected his successor. General Wright is buried in Magnolia Cemetery (formerly City Cemetery), Augusta.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1871661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871661", "title": "Alfred Iverson Jr.", "text": "Alfred Iverson Jr.\n\nAlfred Iverson Jr. (February 14, 1829 – March 31, 1911) was a lawyer, an officer in the Mexican–American War, a U.S. Army cavalry officer, and a Confederate general in the American Civil War. He served in the 1862–63 campaigns of the Army of Northern Virginia as a regimental and later brigade commander. His career was fatally damaged by a disastrous infantry assault at the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg. General Robert E. Lee removed Iverson from his army and sent him to cavalry duty in Georgia. During the Atlanta Campaign, he achieved a notable success in a cavalry action near Macon, Georgia, capturing Union Army Maj. Gen. George Stoneman and hundreds of his men.\n\nIverson was born in Clinton, Jones County, Georgia. He was the son of Alfred Iverson Sr., United States Senator for Georgia and a fierce proponent of secession, and Caroline Goode Holt. The senator decided on a military career for his son and enrolled him in the Tuskegee Military Institute.\n\nIverson's career as a soldier began at the age of 17, when the Mexican–American War began. His father raised and equipped a regiment of Georgia volunteers and young Iverson left Tuskegee to become a second lieutenant in the regiment. He left the service, in July 1848, to become a lawyer and contractor. In 1855, his Mexican–American War experience gained him a commission as a first lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Cavalry regiment. In that role he served in efforts to suppress the violence known as Bleeding Kansas.\n\nAt the start of the Civil War, Iverson resigned from the U.S. Army and received a commission from his father's old friend, Confederate President Jefferson Davis, as colonel of the 20th North Carolina Infantry, a unit he played a strong role in recruiting. His regiment was initially stationed in North Carolina, but was called to the Virginia Peninsula in June 1862, for the Seven Days Battles. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Gaines's Mill, in the division commanded by Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill, by leading the only successful regiment of the five that were assigned to capture a Union artillery battery. Iverson was severely wounded in the charge and his regiment took heavy casualties. Unfortunately for Iverson and the Confederacy, this battle would turn out to be the high point of his military career.\n\nIverson recovered in time to rejoin the Army of Northern Virginia in the Maryland Campaign. In the Battle of South Mountain, his entire brigade was forced to retreat after their brigade commander, Brig. Gen. Samuel Garland, was mortally wounded. Iverson's regiment ran away at the Battle of Antietam a few days later, although he was able to rally them to return to the battle. After the battle, Iverson was promoted to brigadier general on November 1, 1862, and given command of the brigade; causing the more senior Colonel Duncan K. McRae, who had been in temporary command, to resign from the Army. His first assignment commanding his new brigade was at the Battle of Fredericksburg, but he was assigned to the reserve and saw no action. Conflict soon resulted, however. When he attempted to name a new colonel for the 20th North Carolina, a personal friend from outside of the regiment, 26 of his officers signed a letter of protest against the action. Iverson attempted to arrest all 26 officers, but eventually cooled off. His friend was not placed as the new colonel, but Iverson petulantly refused all winter to promote any of the other candidates for the position.\n\nAt Chancellorsville, Iverson's brigade participated in Lt. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson's famous flanking march, suffering heavy casualties (including Iverson himself, wounded in the groin by a spent shell), but managed to get less credit and notice than two other brigades in the line. Returning to the rear to get support for his flank, many of his officers concluded that he was shirking. His reasonable performance at Gaines's Mill the previous year forgotten, rumors swirled that he had achieved his command only by family political influence.\n\nThe nadir of Iverson's career was at the Battle of Gettysburg, where on July 1, 1863, his brigade of North Carolinians unknowingly marched into an ambush to the northwest of town. The division of Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes began its attack from Oak Hill with the brigades of Col. Edward A. O'Neal and Iverson. The attack fell apart for multiple reasons. Rodes acted somewhat hastily, seeing limited Union forces at his front, but not that reinforcements were arriving from the town. Douglas Southall Freeman faulted Rodes for selecting two brigade commanders \"who had not distinguished themselves in the battles of May\" [i.e., Chancellorsville]. Because of a misunderstanding, O'Neal used only three of his four regiments and he attacked on a narrow front at a place different from where Rodes had carefully indicated. Although the two brigades were meant to attack in support of each other, there is confusion about who was supposed to move first. O'Neal's ineffective attack was repulsed, leaving Iverson's flank exposed. But the most significant problem was that the two brigade commanders chose not to lead their brigades in person, remaining behind their advance. After the battle there were rumors among the North Carolinians that Iverson was too drunk to lead, but his battle report indicated that he deliberately chose to remain behind and historians present no evidence that alcohol was involved in his decision.\n\nIn the words of the historian of the 23rd North Carolina, \"unwarned, unled as a brigade, went forward Iverson's deserted band to its doom.\" As O'Neal's men fell back, Iverson's 1,350 men began to drift left toward a stone wall behind which veteran regiments of Brig. Gen. Henry Baxter's Union brigade were hidden. As the Confederates approached within 50 to 100 yards of the wall, the Union soldiers opened fire, hitting at least 500 men, felling them almost in parade-ground alignment. Most of the survivors of three of Iverson's regiments were captured by a Union countercharge.\n\nFrom Iverson's vantage point, it seemed as if his brigade was surrendering, and he exclaimed to Rodes that his men were \"cowards\". Many of his men lay prone in battle formation while others waved white handkerchiefs. He did not realize that the former were dead or wounded and the latter surrounded and trapped under heavy fire. Upon reaching the front after conferring with Rodes, Iverson may have suffered a nervous breakdown, overwhelmed by the fate his men had suffered, possibly as many as 900 casualties, one of the most significant brigade losses at Gettysburg. (The men were later buried in shallow graves on this spot on Oak Ridge, which is known to locals as Iverson's Pits, and is a favorite site for believers in the supernatural.) Iverson was \"unfit for command\" for the rest of the battle. He commanded fragments of his brigade attached to the brigade of Brig. Gen. Stephen Dodson Ramseur.\n\nDuring the retreat from Gettysburg, Iverson's brigade fought credibly against Union cavalry in Hagerstown, Maryland, but Gen. Robert E. Lee wanted nothing more to do with the tarnished officer. At Williamsport, Maryland, Lee assigned Iverson as temporary provost marshal, which removed him from combat command, reassigning his men to another brigade.\n\nHe was removed altogether from the Army of Northern Virginia in October 1863, ordered back to Georgia to replace Maj. Gen. Henry R. Jackson in command of the state forces, headquartered at Rome. He spent several months reorganizing the Georgia troops in preparation for the defense of the state against Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's Atlanta Campaign.\n\nIn 1864, Iverson commanded a cavalry brigade in Maj. Gen. William T. Martin's division, Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's cavalry corps, during the Atlanta Campaign. On July 29, near Macon, Iverson's 1,300 cavalrymen defeated about 2,300 under Maj. Gen. George Stoneman, taking about 200 prisoners. During Iverson's pursuit, he and his men captured an additional 500 at Sunshine Church on July 31, including Stoneman.\n\nIverson was on duty in North Carolina at the end of the war. As commander in Greensboro he watched his garrison slip away until it was unable to stop fugitive soldiers from plundering part of the city.\n\nAfter the war, Iverson engaged in business at Macon, moving to Florida in 1877 to farm oranges. He died in Atlanta, Georgia, and is buried there in Oakland Cemetery.\n\n\n\n\n"}

One of the commanders of the Iron Brigade of the Army of the Potomac, Meredith led the brigade in the Battle of Gettysburg. Although he never fully recovered from the wounds he received that day, he became a prize winning farmer and cattleman at home and hosted veterans of his unit.\n\nSolomon Meredith was born in Guilford County, North Carolina, the youngest of twelve children born to David and Mary Farrington Meredith. Meredith's grandfather, James Meredith, fought at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse during the American Revolutionary War. The Merediths were Quaker, and educated young Solomon at home. He was nicknamed \"Long Sol\" for his towering 6' 7\" body.\n\nIn 1836 Meredith married Anna Hannah, a daughter of Samuel Hannah, who would later become the 6th Indiana State Treasurer. Although their daughter Mary died as a child, their three sons survived to adulthood. The eldest, Lt. Samuel H. Meredith, served under his father and would die at home in 1864 of wounds received at the 1862 battle of Gainesville; Captain David M. Meredith of the 15th Indiana won a brevet promotion to Major and died in Alabama in 1867; Henry Clay Meredith (1843-1882) would survive and inherit the farm. Although born a Quaker, Meredith became a Methodist. He was also a Freemason and member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.\n\nIn 1829, aged 19, Solomon left North Carolina (where Quakers faced increasing persecution for helping slaves escape) and walked to Wayne County, Indiana, where he found work chopping wood and working on a farm. He later clerked in a general store in Centerville, then opened a store in Milton, before moving to Cambridge City, the Wayne county seat. He owned a sprawling farm, \"Oakland,\" near Cambridge City.\nIn 1834, Meredith won election as the Sheriff of Wayne County, and served for two years before winning election (and re-election) to the Indiana House of Representatives as a fervent Whig. During this time, Wayne County was important in the Underground Railroad, although leading businessman (and Guildford County, North Carolina emigrant) Levi Coffin would move to Cincinnati in 1847. Meredith represented Wayne County in the Indiana House until 1849, when newly elected Whig President Zachary Taylor appointed him U.S. Marshall for Indiana. He served four years, then again won election to represent Wayne County in the Indiana house, this time as a member of the new Republican Party. While a legislator, Meredith supported education, as well as internal improvement projects. He supported the Whitewater Canal and worked with his brother in law John S. Newman to raise funds for the Indiana Central Railroad (ultimately acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad), and later became president of the Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad Company.\n\nWhen the Civil War erupted in early 1861, Meredith recruited hundreds of men from his county and organized them into a volunteer regiment of infantry. Governor Oliver P. Morton appointed Meredith as the first colonel of the newly named 19th Indiana, despite his lack of previous military experience. The regiment traveled by train to Washington, D.C., where it would eventually join the Army of the Potomac and be brigaded with three Wisconsin regiments in what became famous as the Iron Brigade.\n\nMeredith and his Hoosiers fought their first engagement during the Northern Virginia Campaign at Brawner's Farm, where his horse was shot from under him, crushing him and breaking several ribs. During the Maryland Campaign, Meredith took part in the Battle of South Mountain, but then abruptly reported himself unfit for duty due to the lingering effects of his injuries at Brawner's Farm and fatigue resulting from to the long march up from Virginia. He went to Washington to rest and recuperate while his replacement, Lt. Col. Alois O. Bachman, was killed while leading a charge near the Cornfield at Antietam. As far as Brig. Gen.John Gibbon was concerned, he deserved to be stripped of his command for this. A month later, Gibbon was promoted to Maj. Gen. and given the 2nd Division, I Corps to command, then recommending either Colonel Lysander Cutler of the 6th Wisconsin or Colonel Lucius Fairchild of the 2nd Wisconsin to take over the Iron Brigade. However, Major General Joseph Hooker (who had commanded the I Corps at Antietam and was recovering from a wound sustained in that battle) was visited by Meredith requesting promotion to brigadier general. Regardless of the Antietam fiasco and Gibbon's disdain for him, he had powerful political connections in the form of Indiana Governor Oliver Morton. This was enough to convince Hooker, who submitted his request to Washington. In November, Meredith thus took the field wearing the stars of a brigadier general while John Gibbon fumed and cursed Hooker as a man who had sacrificed his principles for political gain. Meredith led the brigade in combat for the first time at Fredericksburg, where he drew the ire of division commander Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday, who temporarily replaced Meredith with Col. Lysander Cutler.\n\nIn the spring of 1863, Meredith's brigade participated in the Chancellorsville Campaign, but saw relatively little combat. That would change in July, when the Iron Brigade suffered significant casualties during the first day's fighting at Gettysburg in Herbst's Woods and on Seminary Ridge. They were one of the first infantry brigades to reach the field and in the morning they routed the shocked (and exhausted) brigade of Brig. Gen. James J. Archer and captured Archer. However, in the afternoon the brigade was ravaged by a flanking maneuver by the 11th North Carolina and a frontal assault by the 26th North Carolina, of Confederate Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew's brigade. Meredith was wounded when he was struck in the head by shrapnel, fracturing his skull and giving him a severe concussion. The blow killed his horse, which then fell on him, breaking his ribs and injuring his right leg. He was disabled and unfit for any further field command.\n\nMeredith performed administrative duty for the rest of the war, commanding garrisons protecting Union river ports along the Mississippi at Cairo, Illinois, and Paducah, Kentucky. While still on Army duty in mid-1864, Meredith unsuccessfully ran against George Julian for the United States House of Representatives. Openly feuding with his opponent, Meredith beat Julian unconscious with a whip, but used his political influence to have charges of assault and battery dropped.\n\nWith the war over in 1865, Meredith mustered out from the volunteer army with the brevet rank of major general and returned home to Indiana. Although he never completely recovered from the wounds he received at Gettysburg, Meredith resumed farming and became the local tax assessor in 1866-1867. From 1867 to 1869, he became the surveyor general of the Montana Territory. He then retired to his farm and raised prize-winning long-horn cattle, sheep, and horses. After the general's death, his son Henry Clay Meredith and daughter-in-law Virginia Claypool Meredith ran the farm and raised Meredith's herd.\n\nSolomon Meredith died on his farm in 1875. He is buried in Riverside Cemetery in Cambridge City, Indiana.\n\nThe Grand Army of the Republic Post in Richmond, Indiana, was later named in his honor.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Robinson\n\nJohn Cleveland Robinson (April 10, 1817 – February 18, 1897) had a long and distinguished career in the United States Army, fighting in numerous wars and culminating his career as a Union Army brigadier general of volunteers and brevet major general of volunteers in the American Civil War. In 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated and the U.S. Senate confirmed Robinson's appointment to the brevet grade of major general in the regular army. He was a recipient of the Medal of Honor for valor in action in 1864 near Spotsylvania Courthouse, Virginia, where he lost a leg. When he retired from the U.S. Army on May 6, 1869, he was placed on the retired list as a full rank major general, USA. After his army service, he was Lieutenant Governor of New York from 1873 to 1874 and served two terms as the president of the Grand Army of the Republic.\n\nRobinson was born on April 10, 1817 in Binghamton, New York. He was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, July 1, 1835. He was expelled from the academy on March 14, 1838 (for insubordination), and went on to study law. After a year as a civilian, he rejoined the army in October 1839 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 5th U.S. Infantry Regiment.\n\nRobinson traveled to Corpus Christi, Texas, in September 1845 to join Gen. Winfield Scott and the Army of Occupation as a regimental and brigade quartermaster. In June 1846, Robinson was promoted to first lieutenant and served in the Mexican–American War, fighting with distinction in the Battle of Monterey. He also was in action at the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. He served as regimental or brigade quartermaster between March 28, 1847 and September 1, 1847 and between January 27, 1849 and August 12, 1850.\n\nRobinson was commissioned as a captain on August 12, 1850 and then served in various garrisons. He led troops in several engagements against hostile Indians in Texas in 1853-54. In 1856, Robinson went into combat again, serving in Florida during the Third Seminole War, where he furthered his military record of bravery and efficient services. He led a series of expeditions against the Seminoles in the Everglades and Big Cypress Swamp.\n\nAt the close of the Seminole War, he was assigned command of Fort Bridger and sent to the Utah Territory. In 1857–58, he served at Camp Floyd during the Utah War. Camp Floyd had the largest concentration of US Troops at any post prior to the Civil War. While stationed in the desolate Utah Territory he and others petitioned the Freemason's Grand Lodge of Missouri to establish a Masonic Lodge in the Utah Territory. It was granted the March 6, 1859, Rocky Mountain #205 under dispensation from Missouri, and Captain Robinson became the first Worshipful Master of the first Masonic Lodge in Utah. In the late 1850s, he was ordered back east to assume command of Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War, Maryland was a border state, remaining loyal to the Union despite being a slave state. Secessionists planned to seize Fort McHenry, but Robinson made it appear that reinforcements were imminent for his small 60-man garrison, and was able to retain control of the fort.\n\nRobinson was soon sent to Detroit as an army recruiting officer, and for a short time, assisted Governor William Dennison in raising troops in Columbus, Ohio. In September 1861, he was appointed as colonel of the 1st Michigan Volunteer Infantry, a regiment he helped recruit. That autumn, he was also promoted to major of the 2nd U.S. Infantry in the regular army, concurrent with his assignment in the volunteer army. Within a few months, he was commanding a brigade of volunteers at Newport News, Virginia in preparation for the Peninsula Campaign.\n\nWith his vast combat experience and with the growing need in the expanding army for senior officers, he was promoted again by President Lincoln on April 30, 1862, to rank from April 28, 1862, to brigadier general of volunteers. He was transferred soon afterwards to the Army of the Potomac, where he assumed command of a brigade in the division of Philip Kearny in the III Corps. He served with distinction during the Peninsula Campaign, particularly at the Seven Days Battles. General Kearny lavishly praised Robinson in his official report.\n\nRobinson also fought that year during the Northern Virginia Campaign at the Second Battle of Bull Run. He was wounded at Broad Run, Virginia on August 27, 1862. He missed the Maryland Campaign as his brigade was not present. He next fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg. He was transferred to command of second division I Corps in time to participate in Chancellorsville in 1863.\n\nDuring the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, Robinson commanded a division in the I Corps north of the borough of Gettysburg. He and his men fought well on July 1, but eventually had to retire through the streets of the town under the pressure of overwhelming numbers. For his valor and meritorious performance at Gettysburg, he was brevetted as a lieutenant colonel in the regular army. He was again brevetted, this time to colonel in the regular army, for his efforts during the Mine Run Campaign and the 1864 Battle of the Wilderness. In the latter battle, Robinson commanded the 2nd Division in the reorganized V Corps, which was composed of his old division plus a brigade of Maryland troops.\n\nRobinson presided over the court-martial of Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Rowley for his conduct at Gettysburg.\n\nAfter the war he received a Medal of Honor for his actions during a preliminary action to the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, the fight at Alsop's farm at Laurel Hill, Virginia, on May 8, 1864. According to the official citation, Robinson \"placed himself at the head of the leading brigade in a charge upon the enemy's breastworks; was severely wounded\". On December 12, 1864, President Lincoln nominated Robinson for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers to rank from June 27, 1864 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865. However, having been shot through the left knee and permanently disabled following its amputation at the thigh, Robinson never returned to field duty after Alsop's Farm. He performed administrative duty as a district commander in the Department of the East for the rest of the war.\n\nRobinson remained in the army following the cessation of hostilities and was assigned command of the Freedmen's Bureau in Federally occupied North Carolina. On April 10, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Robinson for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination on May 4, 1866. In July 1866, he was promoted to full colonel in the regular army. On July 17, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Robinson for appointment to the brevet grade of major general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866. Robinson was mustered out of the volunteer army on September 1, 1866. In 1867, Robinson was assigned to command of the Military Department of the South. The following year, he was again reassigned, this time to lead the Department of the Lakes. Robinson retired from the U.S. Army on May 6, 1869, receiving a commission to the full grade of major general in the regular army on the date of his retirement.\n\nRobinson, as with many leading political and social figures of his day, was a Freemason, becoming a member of Binghamton Lodge #177 and rising through its ranks.\n\nRobinson, long a popular figure in New York, was elected the Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1872, serving under Republican Governor John A. Dix. Robinson was active in veterans affairs, and became the Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic from 1877 to 1879. A decade later, he was elected as president of the Society of the Army of the Potomac. He was also a member of the New York Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.\n\nIn his elder years, Robinson lost his eyesight and became totally blind.\n\nHe died at home on February 18, 1897 at the age of 79 and was buried at Spring Forest Cemetery in Binghamton, Broome County, New York.\n\nA bronze statue of Robinson stands in Gettysburg National Military Park near Oak Ridge.\n\nRank and Organization:\n\nCitation:\n\n\n\nAttribution\n\n"}

The highway runs through rural parts of three counties in the Lower Peninsula. The southern end runs along the Michigan Meridian and parallel to the Tittabawassee River. Prior to 1962, M-30's southern terminus was at a junction with M-46 in Merrill. Since then, the segment south of US Highway 10 (US 10) was returned to local control and decommissioned. In May 2009, M-30 was extended southerly from US 10 to M-20, restoring some of the highway decommissioned in the 1960s to M-30.\n\nM-30 is a rural, two-lane highway. M-30 follows Meridian Road starting at an intersection with M-20 (Isabella Road) outside of Midland. From this intersection, the highway runs north along the Michigan Meridian through forest lands to a crossing of the Tittabawassee River near Sanford. M-30 passes through the community and crosses the US 10 freeway near the location where the latter crosses a narrow section of Sanford Lake. The road continues north running parallel to the lake along the meridian to a point near Edenville. There, the highway turns westerly along Curtis Road and then back northerly on Midland Road to a crossing of the Tittabawassee and Wixom Lake.\n\nPast the river and lake crossings, M-30 angles to the northeast to return to the Michigan Meridian. The area adjacent to the lake is farm land, but continuing north, the highway returns to the woodlands of the Au Sable State Forest. M-30 intersects M-61 at Wooden Shoe Village near Smallwood Lake. The highway continues to parallel the Tittabawassee River, crossing several of its smaller tributaries, until a point south of the Gladwin–Ogemaw County county line. The trunkline passes through a small unnamed, unincorporated community northwest of Hockaday near Indian and Elk lakes as the road turns to the northeast between the lakes in the area. M-30 crosses the county line near Edwards and continues northward. The highway turns to the northeast as it approaches West Branch, crossing under Interstate 75 (I-75) without an interchange. M-30 ends at Business Loop I-75/M-55 on the west side of West Branch.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains M-30 like all other parts of the state trunkline highway system. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic using its roads in surveys using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). MDOT calculates the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys. For 2009, the highest traffic levels were observed on the section north of US 10 at 7,579 vehicles per day. The lowest AADT levels were the 2,952 vehicles between the M-61 junction and the Gladwin–Ogemaw county line. The survey did not include the section south of US 10. No segment has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.\n\nM-30 was first designated by July 1, 1919. The original routing only ran from Winegars to West Branch. South of Winegars, the roadway is a portion of M-18. An extension of M-18 in 1928 or 1929 south of Beaverton led to the redesignation and extension of M-30 south through Edenville and Sanford to end at M-46. M-30 was completely paved as the last of gravel roadway were completed between Sanford and the Midland–Saginaw county line in 1961. The next year, when M-30 was truncated to end at the US 10 freeway in Sanford, the remaining portion south of US 10 was turned over to county control. On May 13, 2009, the Midland County Road Commission (MCRC) and the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) signed a Memorandum of Understanding that transferred control of Meridian Road south of US 10 to M-20. The roadway transferred included a newly constructed bridge over the Tittabawassee River and other segments of roadway rebuilt by the MCRC. On May 20, 2020, the bridge carrying M-30 over Wixom Lake collapsed after two dams on the Tittabawassee River failed, leading to severe flooding.\n\n\n"}

Fleet Company in Lynchburg, Va. Phospho soda consisted mostly of monobasic sodium phosphate monohydrate and dibasic sodium phosphate heptahydrate. Phospho soda is often taken in a double dose (the usual 45ml dose, followed by a second 45ml dose 6 hours later), to prepare for colonoscopy. It is still used outside the US.\n\nAn amount of Phospho soda (normally 1.5 fluid ounce or 45 ml) is usually mixed with water or other clear liquids such as ginger ale. This preparation usually results in a bowel movement anywhere from 30 minutes to 6 hours after it is taken. Phospho soda is also available in various flavors to make it more palatable.\n\nThe use of Phospho soda has been known to lead to acute phosphate nephropathy. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), \"Acute phosphate nephropathy is a form of acute kidney injury that is associated with deposits of calcium-phosphate crystals in the renal tubules that may result in permanent renal function impairment. Acute phosphate nephropathy is a rare, serious adverse event that has been associated with the use of OSPs [oral sodium phosphates]. The occurrence of these events was previously described in an Information for Healthcare Professionals sheet and an FDA Science Paper issued in May 2006. Additional cases of acute phosphate nephropathy have been reported to FDA and described in the literature since these were issued.\" \n\nFleet’s Phospho-soda products have been linked to kidney damage since the 1990s.\n\nOn December 11, 2008, the FDA issued a Safety Alert stating that \"FDA has become aware of reports of acute phosphate nephropathy, a type of acute kidney injury, associated with the use of oral sodium phosphate products (OSP) for bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy or other procedures. These products include the prescription products, Visicol and OsmoPrep, and OSPs available over-the-counter without a prescription as laxatives (e.g., Fleet Phospho-soda). In some cases when used for bowel cleansing, these serious adverse events have occurred in patients without identifiable factors that would put them at risk for developing acute kidney injury ... The agency is equally concerned about the risks associated with the use of OSP products that are available over-the-counter (OTC), for example, Fleet Phospho-soda, when used at higher doses for bowel cleansing.\"\n\nFollowing FDA's Alert, C.B. Fleet recalled its Fleet Phospho-Soda Products.\n\nPhospho soda can be used for a general laxative, but is not recommended. The dosage then is best cut in half and used only once instead of twice.\n\nPhospho soda works by drawing liquid from the body into the colon, therefore it can cause severe dehydration, especially if not used properly. Usage in this context is highly recommended to be performed only with a doctor's knowledge and consent.\n\nWhen Phospho soda is used as preparation for colonoscopy, 1.5 fluid ounces (45ml), mixed with an equal amount of water or any clear liquid and followed by 8 oz of water, is taken, followed by a second dose 6 hours later (3 oz total). It will cause very loose, eventually watery stools, usually starting within an hour or so and lasting several hours.\n\nA 2007 study showed that in patients with decreased renal function, Phospho soda may worsen renal impairment compared to polyethylene glycol-based laxatives. In patients without kidney problems, no difference was observed.\n\nSince late 2004, there has been a great deal of litigation in both state and federal courts alleging renal injury following the use of Fleet Phospho-Soda. On June 23, 2009, the United States Judicial Panel on Multi District Litigation consolidated all federal Oral Sodium Phosphate Solution lawsuits to the Northern District of Ohio, before the Honorable Ann Aldrich. Additional documents from Phospho-Soda lawsuits have been published at the website DangerousDrugs.us.\n"}

He studied at Allegheny College and then transferred to the United States Military Academy in his senior year, graduating in 1844, ranking 20th out of 25 cadets. Among his classmates were future Civil War generals Alfred Pleasonton and Winfield S. Hancock. He became a close personal friend of Ulysses S. Grant, who had graduated the year before. Hays was brevetted as a second lieutenant in the 8th U.S. Infantry. He served in the Mexican–American War, and won special distinction in an engagement near Atlixco. In April 1848, he resigned his commission in the army and returned to Pennsylvania.\n\nHe settled in Venango County, where he engaged in the manufacture of iron from 1848–50 before briefly leaving for the California gold fields to seek his fortune. Failing that, he returned home and became an assistant construction engineer for the railroad until 1854. From 1854 through 1860, Hays was a civil engineer for the city of Pittsburgh, helping plan several bridge building projects.\n\nAt the beginning of the Civil War, Hays re-entered the service as colonel of the 63rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment, also holding the rank of captain in the 16th U.S. Infantry in the regular army to date from May 14, 1861. His men knew him to be \"as brave as a lion.\" During the Peninsula Campaign, he was attached with his regiment to the first brigade of Kearny's division of Heintzelman's III Corps. He fought in the battles of Yorktown, Williamsburg, Seven Pines, Savage's Station, and Malvern Hill. At the close of the Seven Days Battles, he was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel in the regular army for gallantry in action, as Hays had directed a bayonet charge with his regiment into the enemy lines to cover the retreat of his brigade. Hays briefly went on sick leave a month later, suffering from partial blindness and paralysis of his left arm, injuries incurred from battle.\n\nHays resumed command of the 63rd Pennsylvania during the Northern Virginia Campaign in August and again led a charge in the Second Battle of Bull Run, receiving a painful wound that shattered his leg. While recovering, he was appointed brigadier general of volunteers, September 29, 1862. Early in 1863 Hays was made a brigade commander in XXII Corps in the defenses of Washington, D.C. His brigade, composed largely of troops surrendered after the Battle of Harpers Ferry, was added to the Army of the Potomac as the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, II Corps.\nDue to his seniority, after the reassignment of William H. French, Hays was assigned command of the third Division during the Gettysburg Campaign. (Col. George L. Willard took command of Hays's brigade.) During the Battle of Gettysburg, Hays's division defended the right of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. The division held firm in the repulse of the Confederate attack on July 3, 1863, even counterattacking the left flank of the Confederate attacking force. Hays's passion and flair for the dramatic led to a notable incident as Confederate prisoners were being rounded up: \"When the smoke cleared, Hays, who was unhurt but had had two horses shot out from under him, kissed his aide in the exhilaration of the moment, grabbed a captured Rebel battle flag and riding down the division's line dragged it in the dirt ...\" For his efforts at Gettysburg, Hays gained the brevet rank of colonel in the regular army. Later returning to divisional command before the Bristoe Campaign, he was engaged at Auburn and Mine Run.\n\nHays's last major engagement as a division commander was at Morton's Ford on the Rapidan River in Virginia on February 6, 1864. A demonstration in force by II Corps became a bloody fiasco with Hays's division suffering 252 casualties. Stories about Hays being drunk on duty arose from that defeat by Confederates of Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's corps.\n\nWhen the Army of the Potomac was reorganized in early 1864 under his friend Grant's guidance, Hays was placed in command of the 2nd Brigade of Birney's 3rd Division of the II Corps. Hays was unhappy at losing division command but was happy to serve once more under Birney, with whom he had campaigned in III Corps. During the Overland Campaign, Hays was killed in action near the junction of the Brock and Plank Roads in the Wilderness, being struck in the head by a Minié ball.\n\nHe was buried in Allegheny Cemetery (Section 8, Lot 149) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At a campaign stop in Pittsburgh during his run for the presidency, Ulysses S. Grant visited Hays's grave and wept openly.\n\nPost #3 of the Grand Army of the Republic in Pittsburgh was named for General Alexander Hays, as was Fort Hays and the city of Hays in Kansas.\nAlexander Hays Road in Bristow, Virginia, is named for him. The road is in New Bristow Village in Bristow, Virginia, adjacent to the Bristoe Station Battlefield.\n\n\nAttribution:\n\n\n"}

Hobart Ward\n\nJohn Henry Hobart Ward (June 17, 1823 – July 24, 1903), most commonly referred to as J.H. Hobart Ward, was a career United States Army soldier who fought in the Mexican–American War and served in the New York state militia. He also served as a Union general during the American Civil War.\n\nDuring the Civil War he was wounded several times, and noted for both his performance in the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg and for his misconduct in the 1864 Battle of the Wilderness. After the war Ward worked in New York's Superior Court, and was also remembered for his death when he was hit by a train.\n\nWard was born in New York City to a family of military veterans. His grandfather John Ward had fought in the American Revolutionary War and had suffered a disabling wound, as had his father, James Ward, during the War of 1812. Hobart Ward was educated at Trinity College and enlisted at the age of 18 in the 7th U.S. Infantry. He was promoted several times over the next four years, reaching the rank of Sergeant Major.\n\nWard saw considerable combat action during the Mexican–American War, fighting in the siege of Fort Brown and being wounded at the Battle of Monterrey. He recovered in time to participate in the capture of Veracruz.\n\nWard returned to his native New York and served as assistant commissary general from 1851 until 1855, when he became the state's commissary general, a post he held until 1859.\n\nResponding to President Abraham Lincoln's call to arms at the outbreak of the Civil War, Ward recruited the 38th New York Infantry and was appointed its first colonel. He led his regiment at the July 1861 First Battle of Bull Run, becoming acting commander of Brig. Gen. Orlando B. Willcox's brigade when the latter was wounded in battle. He next saw action in the 1862 Peninsula Campaign in Brig. Gen. David B. Birney's brigade of III Corps. Ward continued to perform well during the Northern Virginia Campaign, seeing more action at Second Bull Run and Chantilly. For his efforts, he was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on October 4, 1862, and assigned command of what had been Birney's brigade in the III Corps of the Army of the Potomac. (Birney had succeeded Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny, who had been killed leading his division at Chantilly.) Ward commanded the brigade at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.\n\nDuring the Gettysburg Campaign, Ward's brigade was assigned on July 2 by Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles to hold a large area from the Wheatfield Road to Devil's Den. Stretched thin with little reserves, Ward's brigade nevertheless held their ground stubbornly. Regiments were moved to threatened points of the line, especially the left flank. Finally it was driven back by determined Confederate attacks. Ward became temporary commander of the division when Birney assumed corps command following the wounding of General Sickles. Col. Hiram Berdan took command of Ward's brigade. Ward lost 781 officers and men out of 2,188 present, a loss of 35.7%. Ward suffered a wound on July 2 but did not relinquish command.\n\nWard was again wounded later that summer in fights at Kelly's Ford and Wapping Heights. During the Overland Campaign in the spring of 1864, he was assigned a brigade of Birney's 3rd Division, II Corps, one of the divisions in III Corps before the army reorganization of March 1864. Ward was wounded in the head at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. Removed from command on May 12 by Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock for \"misbehavior and intoxication in the presence of the enemy during the battle of the Wilderness,\" Ward was arrested on June 12. Despite these charges, he was nevertheless honorably mustered out on July 18, 1864.\n\nAfter the war, he was a civil employee of New York City, serving as a clerk in the Superior Court from 1871 to 1896.\n\nAt the age of eighty, Ward died in Monroe, New York, after being struck by a passing Erie Railroad train. Following a funeral in Brooklyn, his body was brought back to Monroe and buried in the city's Community Cemetery.\n\n\nAttribution\n"}

It is located in the northwestern Lower Peninsula of the state. Along its route, M-42 begins in Manton and ends north of Lake City, some apart. The highway used to run much farther. Former termini included the Traverse City area from 1919 until 1940 and Mesick from 1940 until 2007.\n\nM-42 is a rural, two-lane highway connecting Manton and Lake City. It runs through wooded terrain on gently rolling hills. Between the western terminus at Michigan Avenue and the US Highway 131 (US 131) freeway in Manton, M-42 runs concurrently Bus. US 131 along Seventh Street. It runs east along Seventh Street to a folded diamond interchange at exit 191 on US 131 east of downtown. Continuing east, it is known as North Road until it crosses the Wexford–Missaukee county line at Seeley Road approximately east of the freeway. Here the road name changes to Mike and Tony Road before M-42 curves southeasterly crossing Morrisy Creek on West Walker Road. East of the unincorporated community of Arlene the highway turns ninety degrees to the south off Walker Road before angling southeasterly skirting the edge of some hills near Dyer Lake just west of M-66. The road turns back due east between Al Moses Road and M-66, where it ends north of Lake City. No section of the trunkline is part of the National Highway System.\n\nM-42 is an original state trunkline dating back to the 1919 signage of the highway system in Michigan. The original highway routing started at M-13 in Manton and ran due west to Mesick. From there the highway turned north and met M-11 at Chums Corners. M-11/M-42 ran concurrently northward into the City of Traverse City where M-42 ended. By May 1929, M-42 was extended east to connect to Lake City. The highway was further extended before 1936 up the Old Mission Peninsula north of Traverse City. In the latter half of 1940, the M-37 designation replaced M-42 north of Mesick through Traverse City to Old Mission. The last sections of highway were paved in late 1951 and early 1952.\n\nIn 2007, the stretch of M-42 between M-37 and US 131 along 16 Road was transferred to the Wexford County Road Commission. This change shortened the highway from to . The section of transferred highway in Wexford County was labeled as \"flexible pavements\" on the 2006 MDOT Truck Operators Map. This classification meant truck traffic on the roadway was subject to weight and load restrictions during spring. This classification is unlike the other highways in the county and surrounding area which were marked as \"all-weather highways\" and would not carry such restrictions.\n\n"}

She kept up the family tradition and worked in theatre and the vaudeville circuit right up until her 30s.\n\nShe had her first film roles at the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company starting in 1908. There she worked with Fatty Arbuckle, Mack Sennett (with whom she was romantically involved for a short time) and Charlie Chaplin amongst others.\nStarting in 1910 at Vitagraph, she was paired with John Bunny for the first of 160 very popular shorts made between 1910 and 1915. These shorts, known as \"Bunnygraphs\", \"Bunnyfinches\", and \"Bunnyfinchgraphs\", established Finch and Bunny as the first popular comedy team in films. The duo became a short-lived trio, when Mabel Normand arrived at the studio.\n\nAfter Bunny's death in 1915 she continued to make comedy shorts, but with less success. She started her own production company in 1916, and released a film with the company the following year, but was never able to regain her popularity. One of her best-known roles in the later silent years was Aunt Susan in Paul Leni's \"The Cat and the Canary\" (1927).\n\nShe found film work in the sound era, but only in small supporting parts. \"The Scarlet Letter\" (1934) gave her one of her more substantial roles in sound films, and she had a cameo in one of Laurel and Hardy's best-known films \"Way Out West\" (1937). Her last film was \"The Women\" (1939).\n\nMost of her films are now lost.\n\nFlora Finch died at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles from blood poisoning. She was taken to the hospital after a streptococcus infection followed an accidental cut to her arm. The infection spread beyond control and the actress lapsed into a coma from bronchial pneumonia.

The IORA is a regional forum, tripartite in nature, bringing together representatives of Government, Business and Academia, for promoting co-operation and closer interaction among them. It is based on the principles of Open Regionalism for strengthening Economic Cooperation particularly on Trade Facilitation and Investment, Promotion as well as Social Development of the region. The Coordinating Secretariat of IORA is located at Ebene, Mauritius.\n\nThe organisation was first established as Indian Ocean Rim Initiative in Mauritius on March 1995 and formally launched on 6–7 March 1997 by the conclusion of a multilateral treaty known as the Charter of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Co-operation. The idea is said to have taken root during a visit of former South African Foreign Minister, Pik Botha, to India in November 1993. It was cemented during the subsequent presidential visit of Nelson Mandela to India in January 1995. Consequently, an Indian Ocean Rim Initiative was formed by South Africa and India. Mauritius and Australia were subsequently brought in. In March 1997, the IOR-ARC was formally launched, with seven additional countries as members: Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Yemen, Tanzania, Madagascar and Mozambique.\n\nThe apex body of the IOR-ARC is the Council of (Foreign) Ministers (COM). The meeting of the COM is preceded by the meetings of the Indian Ocean Rim Academic Group (IORAG), Indian Ocean Rim Business Forum (IORBF), Working Group on Trade and Investment (WGTI), and the Committee of Senior Officials (CSO).\n\nThe objectives of IORA are as follows:\n\nIndian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) has identified six priority areas, namely:\n\nIn addition to these, two focus areas are also identified by IORA, namely Blue Economy and Women's Economic Empowerment.\n\nIORA members undertake projects for economic co-operation relating to trade facilitation and liberalisation, promotion of foreign investment, scientific and technological exchanges, tourism, movement of natural persons and service providers on a non-discriminatory basis; and the development of infrastructure and human resources, poverty alleviation, promotion of maritime transport and related matters, cooperation in the fields of fisheries trade, research and management, aquaculture, education and training, energy, IT, health, protection of the environment, agriculture, disaster management.\n\nBeginning with India's acting as IORA Chair from 2011 to 2013, IORA has divided its maritime cooperation strategy into six priority areas and two focus areas in an attempt to strengthen the organization's institutions and capacities.\n\nIORA considers itself the \"first line of defence\" to build upon existing maritime security measures in the region. Maritime security is generally accepted to include a wide array of issues, ranging from the marine environment to human security; IORA does not stray from this broad definition, noting the importance of both traditional security threats and nontraditional threats such as environmental health and IUU fishing. In addition, IORA includes a \"Maritime Safety\" initiative that is concerned with training, transport, equipment related issues, and assistance in distress situations.\n\nRecognizing the importance of the Indian Ocean Region in global trade, IORA has prioritized trade liberalisation and the freer flow of goods, services, investment, and technology; its \"Action Plan 2017-2021\" put forward the seven targets for trade in the region, ranging from reducing barriers to trade in the short term to making business travel easier in the long term.\n\nThough included under the umbrella \"Maritime Safety and Security\" priority area, fisheries management proved itself to be an especially salient issue for IORA member states, warranting its inclusion as the organization's third highest priority. Through the Fisheries Support Unit (FSU) Flagship Project, IORA intends to promote sustainable conservation and the Blue Economy by reducing exploitation of fish stocks and promoting safe and responsible seafood trade.\n\nThe Indian Ocean Region is prone to disasters both natural and man-made, such as cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, and tidal surges; and oil spills, fires, leakage of poisonous substances, and illegal dumping, respectively. IORA's Disaster Risk Management revolves around the development of knowledge and capabilities to anticipate, respond to, and recover from disasters. IORA's Disaster Risk Management Plan is multidisciplinary, involving national governments, non-governmental organizations, regional and international partners, and the private sector, among others.\n\nIORA promotes tourism and cultural exchanges through policy proposals for cooperation among member states and dialogue partners in order to promote regional economic growth, encourage the sustainable development of eco-tourism, and promote cultural heritage and \"harnessing the economic potential of this heritage.\"\n\nIORA promotes the cooperation of centers of excellence in the Indian Ocean Region, citing the potential academia has to enhance IORA's knowledge on issues relating to marine conservation.\n\nThe initial membership of IORA, then the Indian Ocean Rim Initiative, included only seven countries, the \"Magnificent 7,\" hosted by Mauritius. Though membership grew to 14 states in March 1997, when the first ministerial meeting was convened and the Charter of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation was approved, it has since grown to include 22 states and 10 dialogue partners. Significantly, the organization can now be said to truly comprise the Indian Ocean Region, and the involvement of great powers as dialogue partners has greatly expanded IORA's influence.\n\nThough initially focused solely on economic and trade cooperation, IORA has expanded its scope to include broader maritime security objectives, most notably a focus on non-traditional security threats, which are of growing importance in the maritime realm as a whole.\n\nA \"Focus Area\" of IORA, the Blue Economy gained the attention of all IORA member states at the 14th IORA Ministerial Meeting in 2014 due to its potential for promoting employment, food security, and poverty alleviation, while promoting business models and the economies of member states both large and small. Led by Australia and India, two member states with well-defined plans for engaging in the Blue Economy, a formation of a Blue Economy policy for member states has been relatively well-organized: platforms for cooperation on eco-tourism; the creation of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, which regulates fishing in the Indian Ocean; the research and development of marine and bio-resources for medicinal purposes; and economic investment are some examples of the successful implementation of Blue Economy proposals through IORA.\n\nThough broad in membership and advancing in organizational integrity, IORA faces several obstacles that prevent it from growing into a highly successful and influential regional organization; these issues range from structural deficiencies to geopolitical conflicts existing outside IORA that permeate the organization and prevent cooperation.\n\nThough IORA's large membership affords it with the ability to understand perspectives of a wide array of nations in the Indian Ocean Region, it also creates differences in objectives, in what successful maritime security cooperation would look like, among member states.\n\nEconomically and developmentally, IORA brings together some of the world's richest countries - the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, and Australia - with some of the poorest, such as Mozambique, and island nations with very low GDPs, such as Seychelles; this creates uneven benefits from participation in IORA projects and can lead to economic competition and resentment among member states.\n\nIORA faces competition with other regional and international organizations for member states' attention and investments; in fact, 14 such bodies have IORA member states in their membership.\n\nInterstate conflicts have greatly hindered the strengthening of IORA, most notably through India's intentional exclusion of Pakistan from IORA membership. Though the India-Pakistan dispute has generally been terrestrial, it has manifested itself in IORA, as noted above; in the maritime realm; and in other regional maritime organization. Pakistan and India have recently engaged in an arms race for nuclear submarine technology, with each state having equipped its navy with nuclear weapons to some extent.\n\nIn addition, recent Chinese involvement in the Indian Ocean Region, particularly through the Belt and Road Initiative, has further sparked Indian distrust of a key nation in the strengthening of IORA, in this case, a dialogue partner. Though experts contend that Chinese involvement in the Indian Ocean Region has the potential to greatly benefit IORA proposals, especially those related to the Blue Economy, India sees such involvement as an attempt to shift power in the region from India to China and pushes back accordingly.\n\nThe Association comprises 22 member states and 10 dialogue partners, the Indian Ocean Tourism Organisation and the Indian Ocean Research Group have observer status.\nCountries with the status of dialogue partners are:\n\nA special fund was created in 2004 for the implementation of special projects that would further IORA's commitment to its priority areas by narrowing the focus of member states' contributions.\n\nThe first of the projects supported by the Special Fund, the Fisheries Support Unit commenced operations in late 2011, headquartered in Muscat, Oman at the national Centre for Marine Sciences and Fisheries. The aims of the FSU are to enhance cooperation among member states in regards to fisheries and to conduct research to manage and protect fish stocks. Critically, the FSU is exclusively dialogue-based: it does not make decisions or even provide advice on the management of fisheries or issues such as IUU fishing.\n\nThe IORA Regional Center for Science and Technology Transfer (IORA RCSTT) was formed in October 2008, and is based in Tehran, Iran. The center uses its resources to address issues ranging from disaster response to creating a gene banking database for medicinal plants.\n\nOriginating in the 13th Council of Ministries meeting in 2013, the IOD acts as a stand-alone Track 1.5 discussion that brings together scholars and policy makers from member states to participate in discussions on the topics affecting the Indian Ocean Region and IORA member states.\n\nIntroduced in 2014, the ISDP is dedicated to the least developed countries in an attempt to share best practices among member states in the Blue Economy, effectively bridging the gap between the rich and poor member states. Similar to most other IORA projects, the ISDP is focused primarily on information sharing and peer-to-peer learning.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1871717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871717", "title": "Panel van", "text": "Panel van\n\nA panel van — also known as a car-derived van (United Kingdom) or sedan delivery (United States) — is a cargo vehicle based upon passenger car chassis, and typically has one row of seats with no side windows at the rear. Panel vans are smaller than panel trucks and cargo vans, both of which are built on a truck chassis.\n\nAs it is derived from their car chassis, its evolution of the design is also intermingled with it as well, with much of its evolution dependent upon the various international locations where a particular model's found. North American panel vans were initially based upon the 2-door station wagon models. In Europe, where many cities have histories (and roads) hundreds of years'-long, necessitated that panel vans were (and still are) typically smaller than those elsewhere, and are built on either a bespoke chassis or the chassis of a subcompact car. In Australia, panel vans were a development of the ute (a small pickup truck based on a passenger car chassis, e.g. Chevrolet El Camino), often using the longer wheelbase of the station wagon chassis.\n\nIt is not known when the first panel van entered production, however it became an established type of vehicle by the end of the 1920s.\n\nThe panel van body style has experienced separate evolutions in America, Europe and Australia, as a result of the separate evolutions of the passenger car platforms (upon which the panel van is based) in each region.\n\nA panel van is often known as a delivery in North America. It's an older term that usually only applies to station wagon-based vehicles (sedan deliveries/delivery wagons) such as the Chevrolet Delray and Ford Courier, or pickup-based vans (panel deliveries). Large, boxy unibody vans based on truck platforms (such as the Ford Transit, Ram ProMaster, and Chevrolet Express) as well as smaller unibody vans (like the Ford Transit Connect and Ram Promaster City) are usually referred to as cargo vans or just panel vans. Larger vehicles built on a chassis cab with a custom cargo box are usually called box trucks or moving vans.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Ford produced \"Town Car Delivery\" and \"Wood Panel Delivery\" as part of the Ford Model A model range. Later Plymouth produced a sedan delivery from 1935 until 1941. Pontiac produced deliveries until 1953 in the U.S. and until 1958 in Canada based on the Pontiac Pathfinder. Sedan delivery models were usually produced in small quantities of 200 or less, for example 449 Canadian Pontiac sedan deliveries were built in 1958.\n\nFrom 1959 on, the sedan delivery was no longer practical; it was phased out in 1960 as a Chevrolet model, so the requisite Chevrolet body was no longer available. With the growing sales of the Volkswagen Type 2 and the introduction of compact vans, sedan deliveries faded from the scene. Chevrolet dropped the body type after 1960, while Ford moved it to the Falcon line-up until 1965.\n\nIn the 1970s, Chevrolet and Ford offered subcompact sedan deliveries with the Chevrolet Vega Panel Express and the Ford Pinto Panel Wagon. The Vega Panel Express was introduced in September 1970 and it was Chevy's first sedan delivery in ten years since the final full-size model was offered in 1960. The Vega Panel Express body style accounted for less than 2% of the total Chevrolet Vegas produced during the 1971 through 1975 model years. First year sales of the Vega Panel Express peaked at 7,800 units and after leveling off to 4,000 units per year, only 1,525 were sold in 1975. The Pontiac Astre Panel, Pontiac's version of the Vega Panel Express, was available in Canada in the 1973–75 model years and in the US for 1975. The Pinto Panel Wagon was introduced in 1976 and was offered in both a commercial and a \"factory customized\" Pinto Cruising Wagon version that featured a round porthole style window on each side. The Ford Courier name, previously used for Ford sedan delivery vans, began to be used with Ford's import pickup truck line.\n\nIn 2002, Chrysler showed a concept car edition of a panel van based on the PT Cruiser at the North American International Auto Show, but it was not manufactured. In 2007 Chevrolet released a panel van version of the HHR, marketed as the HHR Panel.\n\nThe small cargo vans currently sold by American manufacturers are from their overseas divisions, for example the Ford Transit Connect and Dodge Ram ProMaster City.\nEuropean panel vans of the 20th century include the Citroën 2CV Fourgonnette, Citroën H Van, Citroën C15, Ford Escort, Morris Minor, Renault Estafette, SEAT Inca and more recently the Renault Kangoo and the Opel Combo.\n\nFrom the 1950s onwards, a larger alternative to the panel van was the van (based on a commercial vehicle chassis instead of a passenger car chassis), such as the Volkswagen Type 2, the DKW van and the first-generation Ford Transit in 1965.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, panel vans benefit from having lower taxes than station wagons and do not have the speed restrictions which apply to larger vans. This has given rise to some anomalies. Authorities and dealers are not always certain on what qualifies as a car-derived van.\n\nExamples of panel vans from the last 30 years are the Renault Kangoo (1997), the Fiat Doblò (2001), Opel Combo (2001), Ford Transit Connect (2002) or the Volkswagen Caddy (2004). They are also purpose-designed to be utilitarian base model MPVs / people carriers, for a range of such vehicles. In 2018, Ford Europe introduced a van configuration of the Ford Fiesta, sharing its body with the regular passenger version.\n\nAs of 2019, the market consists of the following models and many more:\n\nThe first Holden panel van produced in Australia was the FJ Holden, which was released in December 1953, although many manufacturers offered panel vans in their range prior to this. As per many Australian panel vans, it was based on the ute model, with additional body work at the rear. In May 1961, Ford Australia released a panel van version of the XK Falcon, marketed as the \"sedan delivery\" body style. The first panel van by Chrysler Valiant was part of the CL Valiant model range and was introduced in April 1977.\n\nPainters, electricians, general labourers and film crews would often use panel vans, due to the extra cargo area and customisable interior in a relatively compact vehicle. Australian police forces also used panel vans as police vans (nicknamed \"divvy vans\" or \"paddywagons\").\n\nEarly Australian panel vans used swing-down and -up tailgates and a standard roof height, due to their origins of the ute body style. Some later models offered horizontally opening rear doors (nicknamed \"barn doors\") and a higher roofline for increased cargo area.\n\nBy the early 1970s, at a time when the American panelvan was in decline, panel vans had become Australian cultural icons. The most popular model was the Holden Sandman, which was marketed towards young men, in particular targeting the surfing lifestyle. The first Sandman was built in small numbers in 1974 for the HQ model range, however the model's popularity greatly increased with the following HJ generation, which was released in October 1974. In the 1979 movie \"Mad Max\", a modified 1975 HJ Sandman model appeared as one of the vehicles driven by the lead character (played by Mel Gibson).\n\nFord's equivalent of the Sandman was the Surferoo model, which was introduced into the XB Falcon model range in 1973, which was not a successful model. The Surfaroo was replaced by the more popular Sundowner model, which was introduced into the XC Falcon range in 1977. In 1976, Chrysler released a similar model called the Drifter, which was part of the Chrysler CL Valiant. The Drifter was not a success and ceased production in 1978.\n\nYounger drivers were especially attracted to panel vans, for reasons such as the ease with which a mattress could be installed within the cargo bay. Consequently, panel vans also attracted nicknames such as \"sin bins,\" and \"shaggin' wagons\". This kind of activity was frequently carried out at the local drive-in theatre. During the 1970s it also became fashionable to decorate the exterior sides with murals, often painted with intricate detail. Along with the Volkswagen Kombi, panel vans were very popular with surfers, as it was convenient to sleep in the cargo bay while carrying surfboards on the roof.\n\nBy the end of 1979, the Sandman had largely lost its place in the contemporary Australian youth culture – order figures were down and many of the vehicles were now being sold with the stripes and tailgate logos deleted. The final Sandman model was during the Holden HZ series and featured a choice of V8 engines only, along with a four-headlight grille and under bumper front spoiler. According to a GMH Price List dated 25 January 1979, a basic HZ Holden panel van was priced at A$6,076, with the Sandman option package an additional A$1,700. If a buyer selected every Sandman extra, which would cost in excess of 50% more than a basic HZ panel van, Holden would include a velvet mattress with Holden logo embroidered. The Sandman ute was phased out in October 1979, followed by the Sandman panel van prior to the end of the HZ series.\n\nPanel vans in general were declining in popularity during the 1980s. Holden's last panel van was the WB model, which ceased production in 1984. Subsequently, Ford became the sole manufacturer of them until 1999 when production of last entry in the history of the Australian panel van, the XH Falcon, ceased.\n\nIn 2000, Holden unveiled a Sandman show car based on their Holden VU Ute of the time. This Sandman was never released, however from 2003 to 2005 an optional canopy in the same style was sold as panel vans, however they still retained the rear window and firewall of the ute they were originally based on, preventing movement between the cargo bay and the passenger cab, as offered by traditional panel vans.\n\n"}
{"id": "1871718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871718", "title": "Nyack College", "text": "Nyack College\n\nNyack College () is a private Christian college affiliated with the Christian and Missionary Alliance and located in New York City, New York. Enrolling just over 1,000 students, the school is organized in three academic divisions, including the Alliance Theological Seminary, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the College of Graduate and Professional Programs. Nyack offers both on-campus and online courses as part of its undergraduate, graduate, and seminary programs.\n\nThe college plans to close its Nyack location and consolidate to its New York presence at its Manhattan campus beginning September 2020.\n\nOriginally known as the Missionary Training Institute, the school was founded in 1882 in New York City by Dr. A.B. Simpson. Simpson resigned from a prestigious New York City pastorate to develop an interdenominational fellowship devoted to serving unreached people. Simpson's view was shared by many of his contemporaries, including mainline church leaders, laborers, and theological scholars.\n\nThe Missionary Training Institute was later granted a charter by the New York Board of Regents and the school's curriculum was registered by the State Education Department in 1944. In 1953, the school was authorized to confer the Bachelor of Science degree and, in 1961, the Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1960, the corporation was authorized to conduct a post-baccalaureate program as the forerunner of the Alliance Theological Seminary. Nyack first received school accreditation in 1962 from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1963, the school became a member of the American Council on Education.\n\nAfter more than a decade of nomadic address changes for the Institute—including Eighth Avenue and 44th Street in Manhattan (now John's Pizzeria)—28 acres of land were purchased in Rockland County, New York. In 1897, the school relocated to the village of South Nyack and became widely known as a Bible college and institute for ministry preparation.\n\nThe seminary was established in 1960 as the Jaffray School of Missions, a graduate program of the college. The Jaffray School of Missions emphasized the interdisciplinary encounter between theology and the social sciences. In 1974, the Jaffray program was redesigned to include the preparation of students for ministry in North America and abroad. The name of the seminary was subsequently changed to the Alliance School of Theology and Missions. In September 1979, the Alliance School of Theology and Missions became Alliance Theological Seminary, which is recognized by the Christian and Missionary Alliance as the denomination's official seminary in the United States.\nThe school changed its name to Nyack College in 1972 and began offering professional degree programs like education and business in the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1997 the school returned to Manhattan with a branch campus. Steady growth in enrollment at the leased space in Lower Manhattan at 361 Broadway prompted a search in 2008 for a new permanent home for the New York City campus, an initiative that became known as The Miracle in Manhattan. In 2012, Nyack College and Alliance Theological Seminary signed a 20-year lease with a two-year option to purchase the on eight floors of the structure at 2 Washington Street in historic Battery Park. Classes began in the new facility in fall 2013.\n\nOn November 7, 2018 the college announced plans to close its Nyack campus and consolidate its New York operations in its Manhattan-based campus by fall 2019. The Nyack campus was scheduled to close at the end of the 2018-19 academic year, however delays in housing have pushed that out to September 2020.\n\nThe college has multiple debts totaling in excess of $70 million, mainly stemming from the purchase of the Manhattan campus. The closure of the Rockland campus is an attempt to curb the school's operation costs.\n\nThe college is led by an executive team with the top three officers — President, Provost, and Executive Vice President — who collectively have 84 years of service with the institution.\n\nAs of fall 2018, 267 faculty members teach in Nyack's schools and divisions, and they are supported by administrators and staff. At Nyack, 53% of the instructional faculty members are Asian, black or Hispanic; the college has an even divide between male and female staff.\n\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education has named Nyack College a “Great College to Work For” for five consecutive years. The college has also received high marks in the areas of work/life balance, respect and appreciation, compensation and benefits, and diversity. In addition, \"U.S. News and World Report\" designated the college \"Best Ethnic Diversity for North Regional Universities.\"\n\nNyack offers undergraduate, graduate, and seminary programs and is divided into seven individual schools: \nUndergraduate degrees in 41 majors include Associate in Arts, Associate in Science, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music, and Bachelor of Sacred Music. Graduate degrees include Master of Business Administration, Master of Arts, Master of Science, Master of Divinity, Master of Professional Studies, and Doctor of Ministry.\n\nIn spring 2013, Nyack College graduated its first baccalaureates awarded with a degree in nursing. Offered on the residential campus in Nyack, the nursing program includes traditional four-year coursework and prepares students to work in hospitals around the world.\n\nNyack College, through a collaboration with Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison, provides a bachelor of science degree in organizational management to incarcerated individuals at Fishkill Correctional Facility in Beacon, New York and at Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, New York.\n\nNyack College is chartered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York. Its curricula are registered with the New York State Education Department and approved for the training of veterans under Public Laws 550 and 894. Nyack College is also accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.\n\nNyack College's teacher education programs are registered and approved by the State of New York. Nyack College is accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and has programs in Childhood Education recognized by the Association for Childhood Education International (ACEI), Childhood Special Education by the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), Early Childhood Education by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), English Education by the National Council for Teachers of English (NCTE), the Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) organization, the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP), and Math Education by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). Nyack College is a member of and accredited by the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI) for teacher certification. Nyack College's Rockland campus is also an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music. Nyack College's nursing program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) and by the New York State Board of Regents which is recognized nationally by the US Department of Education. Nyack College's social work program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE).\n\nAlliance Theological Seminary (ATS) is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada and, as a division of Nyack College, by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. ATS operates as a graduate school of Nyack College under the charter of Nyack College granted by the Board of Regents of the State Education Department of the University of the State of New York. The Board of Regents for the State of New York empowers Nyack College to grant the Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.), Master of Divinity (M.Div.), Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.), and Master of Arts (M.A.) degrees.\n\nThe Alliance Graduate School of Counseling is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE).\n\nMembership in the American Theological Library Association (ATLA), the New York Area Theological Library Association (NYATLA), and Westchester Academic Library Directors Organization (WALDO) provides cooperative access to interlibrary services and resources to Nyack's academic community.\n\nIn partnership with Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison, Nyack College offers college degree completion programs to prisoners at Sing Sing Correctional Facility. In 2015, the school graduated 24 inmates. To date, the program has a recidivism rate of less than 2% (as compared to the national average of 43%).\n\nThe Alliance Theological Seminary Library, Bailey Library (in Nyack, New York) and the Robert Eastman Library (in Manhattan) support the academic research needs of Nyack's undergraduate, graduate, and seminary students and faculty.\n\nNyack College's library has been located in three separate buildings on campus during the history of the college: Simpson Hall, Shuman Hall, and (since 1994) its present location.\n\n\nOpened in August 2013, the New York City campus is located at 2 Washington Street near Battery Park. This campus is for commuter students and includes a library, classrooms, and laboratories, a rehearsal studio and group counseling observation space.\nIn preparation for the 2020 consolidation, the college has begun construction on student housing in Jersey City, New Jersey at 150 Bay St. Each room will house six students.\n\nThe residential campus in Rockland County, New York, is a plot of land that views the Hudson Valley.

Largely self-taught, his career began as a political cartoonist for the \"Ohio State Journal\" in the late 1920s. At that time he met and shared a studio with cartoonist Milton Caniff, then working for the \"Columbus Dispatch\". Sickles followed Caniff, creator of the \"Terry and the Pirates\" comic strip, to New York City in 1933, where both men initially worked as staff artists for the Associated Press.\n\nSickles was assigned to the action/adventure comic \"Scorchy Smith\", whose creator, John Terry, was suffering from tuberculosis. Loosely modeled on Charles Lindbergh, Scorchy was a pilot-for-hire who flew into numerous high-octane globe-trotting adventures. The series, which started in 1930, was heavily influenced by Roy Crane’s adventure strip \"Wash Tubbs\". Sickles initially illustrated the strip as a ghost artist, but he signed his own name after Terry's 1934 death.\n\nSickles' artwork was much admired and proved highly influential to other comic strip artists. His compositions were cinematic in style, and he had a brisk, impressionistic style of inking that he referred to as “chiaroscuro.” Sickles also was adept in his application of the shading medium Zipatone. Sickles and Caniff worked together for two years, sometimes writing and drawing each other's strips. Caniff acknowledged being heavily influenced by Sickles.\n\nSickles asked the newspaper syndicate for a salary raise in 1936, and when he was turned down, he quit, becoming a successful commercial illustrator. He also ghosted the daily strip \"The Adventures of Patsy\", but otherwise the rest of his career was devoted to magazine illustration. For \"Life\", he illustrated the original publications of \"The Old Man and the Sea\" and \"The Bridges at Toko-Ri\".\n\nHe received the National Cartoonists Society's Advertising and Illustration Award for 1960 and 1962. His \"Scorchy Smith\" strips were reprinted in \"Famous Funnies\" and in two collections published by Nostalgia Press in the 1970s. The end of his run was reprinted in \"Big Fun Comics\" (published by American Comic Archive) which also published Bert Christman's run on the strip. In 2008 IDW Publishing published \"Scorchy Smith and the Art of Noel Sickles\", which reprints the complete 1933–36 run of \"Scorchy Smith\" by Sickles. \n\nSickles died in Tucson, Arizona October 3, 1982. Sickles was interred in Grandview Cemetery, Chillicothe, Ross County, Ohio.\n\nIn 1983, Sickles was posthumously inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1871724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871724", "title": "TCP (antiseptic)", "text": "TCP (antiseptic)\n\nTCP is a mild antiseptic, produced in France by Laboratoires Chemineau in Vouvray and sold in the United Kingdom by Omega Pharma.\n\nTCP was introduced in 1918. The brand name comes from its original chemical name, which was trichlorophenylmethyliodosalicyl (not to be confused with trichlorophenol, a common fungicide). Trichlorophenylmethyliodosalicyl was replaced as the active ingredient by a mixture of phenol and halogenated phenols in the 1950s. The liquid form of TCP is one of the best-known brands of antiseptic in the UK, and its distinctively strong medicinal odour can be identified by many as a generic antiseptic smell.\n\nOmega Pharma acquired the rights to TCP from Pfizer in 2004.\n\nAs of October 2013, TCP is available in , , and bottles as a clear yellow liquid. It is also available as throat lozenges, and was formerly available as a cream.\n\nA spray plaster was or is available under the TCP brand.\n\nThe instructions on the TCP bottle state that TCP can be used for sore throats, mouth ulcers, cuts, grazes, bites and stings, boils, spots and pimples.\n\nIt can also be used as a mouthwash when diluted, and can also be used as a general disinfectant. \n\nPublished advice states that TCP should not be swallowed, and recommends drinking plenty of water if 30ml or more of TCP is swallowed, and seeking medical advice if discomfort persists. Phenolic compounds such as those in TCP are harmful to cats.\n\nTCP Liquid's active ingredients are halogenated phenols and phenol. (One source says each millilitre () of TCP antiseptic contains, Chlorinated Phenols ; Phenol ; Iodinated Phenols ; Sodium Salicylate .) It also contains glycerol, concentrated phosphoric acid, Quinoline Yellow WS and water. Formerly, when the product was manufactured by Unicliffe Ltd, the bottle label's list of ingredients stated, referring to the solution of halogenated phenolic bodies, \"with partial elimination of the ionisable halides\".\n\nTCP was referred to numerous times in a running gag in Episode 2 of Series 2 of the BBC sitcom \"One Foot in the Grave\", alluding to its distinctive and long-lasting odour. TCP was mentioned as an ingredient in a tonic in the film \"The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as We Know It\" (1977). In the 1963 Ian Fleming story \"Agent 007 in New York\", James Bond laments the fact that one of his lovers always gargles with TCP after their trysts. TCP is used as the subject of a song by the same name on The Boys' 1978 album \"Alternative Chartbusters\" written by Honest John Plain. TCP is mentioned in the song \"Obsessions\" by Suede. In the Black Mirror episode \"Metalhead\" (series 4 episode 5), a broken bottle of TCP is seen being pulled out of a backpack in advance of minor surgery.\n\nIt was also referenced in TV sitcom ‘’Only Fools and Horses’’ where lead character Del Boy is said to have treated a stab wound with “TCP and a flannel”, owing to his fear of hospitals.\n\n\n"}

He currently wrestles on the independent circuit. He wrestled on a National scale for Major League Wrestling (MLW) as the leader of The Hart Foundation, where he was the longest reigning MLW World Middleweight Champion and also held the MLW World Tag Team Championship. He has also wrestled for AAA, the short-lived Wrestling Society X, Jersey All Pro Wrestling, and Dragon Gate USA. He operates a wrestling school in Edmonton. He is the son of Georgia Hart of the Hart family and wrestler B.J. Annis. Hart achieved an early degree of fame when he became the youngest wrestler to be signed to the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE). His subsequent release and controversial actions while wrestling on the independent circuit have earned him a measure of infamy. Outside of the ring, Annis has been a mentor to several young wrestlers and has been a trainer at wrestling schools. Among his trainees are Jack Evans, Pete Wilson and his younger cousin Matt Hart. Annis is also a cat lover and breeder of Persian cats which he has used sometimes in storylines and brought with him to matches.\n\nAnnis is the oldest male grandchild of Stu and Helen Hart and the second oldest overall. His mother is of Greek descent through her maternal grandmother and Irish through her maternal grandfather. His maternal grandfather was of Scots-Irish, English and Scottish descent. On his father's side he is part Italian.\n\nAnnis grew up with three siblings, two sisters named Annie and Angela, as well as a younger brother named Matthew who died of Necrotizing fasciitis in 1996. Annis is the cousin of fellow professional wrestlers Natalya Neidhart, Mike Hart, Matt Hart, Harry Smith, Bruce Hart Jr. and Torrin Hart as well as wrestling personalities Lindsay Hart and Georgia Smith.\n\nHart debuted in July 1995 at Rockyford, Alberta, where he teamed up with his brother, Matthew, and defeated his cousin, Harry Smith, and TJ Wilson. In the Calgary-based Stampede Wrestling promotion, Hart teamed with Smith, Wilson and Jack Evans. In 2000, he wrestled for and was a key creative figure in the Matrats promotion. At the age of 16, he wrestled in the opening match of a World Wrestling Federation house show in Calgary, teaming with his cousin, Harry Smith, against Andrew Picarnic and T.J. Wilson (Tyson Kidd) as a tribute to his brother, Matthew, who had recently died.\n\nIn 1998, Hart became the youngest person ever to be signed to a World Wrestling Federation developmental contract, and was sent to train with Dory Funk, Jr. at the \"Funkin' Conservatory\".

Backstage, however, the Special K faction confronted Hart, and mocked him for not being a good high-flying wrestler. On November 1, 2003, Hart competed at a Ring of Honor show in Elizabeth, New Jersey as part of a Scramble Cage match. After losing the match, he began to perform moonsaults and executed a shooting star press from the top of the cage rather than selling the moves he had taken. Hart then vomited at ringside. His actions attracted the ire of many wrestlers, as he endangered some wrestlers by performing moves on them which they were not anticipating. Hart attributes his actions to a concussion suffered during the match, and has since only wrestled at two ROH shows, \"At Our Best\", on March 13, 2004 and \"Final Battle 2009\" against Jack Evans.\n\nHart made several appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. In August 2003, he defeated Jonny Storm and then lost to Juventud Guerrera in the course of the Super X Cup Tournament.

{"id": "1871732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871732", "title": "Super Gran", "text": "Super Gran\n\nSuper Gran is a fictional series about a grandmother with super powers. Initially a series of books written by Forrest Wilson, a children's television show was adapted by Jenny McDade and produced by Tyne Tees Television for Children's ITV. The title character was played by Gudrun Ure, with Iain Cuthbertson as her nemesis, The Scunner Campbell. It originally ran from 1985 to 1987.\n\nTwo series, each consisting of 13 episodes, were produced, alongside a Christmas special. All episodes have been released on DVD by Network. The show inspired two computer games.\n\nAn elderly grandmother, Granny Smith (Gudrun Ure), acquires superpowers when she is accidentally hit by a magic ray created by Inventor Black (Bill Shine). Under the guise of 'Super Gran', she protects the residents of the fictional town of Chiselton from villains such as Roderick Scunner Campbell (Iain Cuthbertson) and his gang, The Muscles (Alan Snell and Brian Lewis) and Tub (Lee Marshall, Jason Carrielies). Super Gran was usually accompanied by her grandson, Willard (Iam Towell, Michael Graham) and Inventor Black's assistant Edison (Holly English, Samantha Duffy).\n\nEpisodes were narrated by Bill McAllister.\n\n\"SuperGran\" was created by author Forrest Wilson. He says that the character was a combination of three characters: Pansy Potter from \"The Beano\", his own mother-in-law, and an unnamed Scottish actress who looked and sounded like he imagined the character should. The first book was published in 1978, followed by several others, many illustrated by David McKee. Following the television series' success, Wilson adapted McDade's scripts as: \"Television Adventures of Super Gran\",\"More Television Adventures of Super Gran\", and \"Super Gran to the Rescue\". Wilson, with Graham Kennedy, also released \"Super Gran: The Picture Book\".\n\nGudrun Ure read \"Super Gran: Complete & Unabridged \" for an audiobook release in 1991. Tyne Tees published an annual in 1985.\n\nThere were some significant differences between the books and the TV series. The most notable was the character of Inventor Black. Although he was an ally of Supergran in the TV series he was the primary antagonist in Wilson's original prose.\n\nThe show was filmed in various locations around North East England, including Tynemouth, Whitley Bay, South Shields and Beamish Museum. Inventor Black's laboratory was housed in an empty church on Tynemouth Front Street, which became Land of the Green Ginger. Sets were housed in an old warehouse in North Shields; its corrugated roof caused sound difficulties when it rained. A stone cottage in Church Way, Earsdon, near Whitley Bay, was used as Super Gran's home. A huge crane used to hoist Super Gran into her flying position was parked in the neighbouring school.\n\nGudrun Ure, who was 59 when she first appeared in the show, had only one stunt double and did a lot of stunts herself. Tyne Tees executive Andrea Wonfor said that they 'used to do all the special effects with trampolines and things.' Filming the Christmas special and the second series took about nine months of 10-hour days (one hour for lunch), beginning in April 1986. Sue Sweeney, who appeared in many episodes, recalls that she \"did everything from sunbathing on the beach at Cullercoats in the rain to a Gorilla at the fancy dress party.\"\n\nThe young actors were all local children from the Newcastle area, and the Scunner's two toughies (Alan Snell and Brian Lewis) were local stand-up comics who performed in clubs at night. Many guest stars appeared on the programme, including George Best, Spike Milligan, Eric Bristow, Roy Kinnear and Geoff Capes. It was Patrick Troughton and Charles Hawtrey's final screen appearances.\n\nFollowing production, memorabilia from the show was displayed at The Land of Green Ginger shopping centre in Tynemouth. After owner Gordon Reed put the props up for sale after deciding to revamp the mall, local electrician Mark Simms bought Super Gran's flying bike and magic ray machine for £403.\n\nThe theme song was performed by Billy Connolly. The full version was released as a single in March 1985 and reached number 32 in the UK singles chart.\n\nThe transmission of the first episode in 1985 was preceded by a \"making-of\" documentary.\n\n\"Super Gran\" won an Emmy, and sold to over 60 countries worldwide. According to director Tony Kysh, \"Tyne Tees was one of the first Western companies to sell to China TV where \"Super Gran\" was a big success.\" The show became a ratings hit in Cuba in the early 2000s (decade), where the show was redubbed into Spanish.\n\nThe character of Super Gran came seventh in \"The Glasgow Herald\"'s 2003 poll, \"The Most Scottish Person In The World\". The University of Nottingham cited \"Super Gran\" as an example of perceptions of grandmothers 'being reshaped by socio-cultural messages as well as personal experience.'\n\nTwo videos were released, each containing three episodes. The first series was released by Network in a 2-DVD set on 10 August 2009, and the second series on 16 May 2011. The Whitley Bay Playhouse is scheduled to host a \"Super Gran\" evening in February 2012, featuring classic episodes, a making-of documentary, photographs and props.\n\nThe series is famous for its 'special effects' (Supergran's ability to jump high and walk/run quickly) and low production standards. This was due mostly to the low budget and quick turnaround time needed to finish an episode.\nThe most used 'special effect' was Supergran's ability to jump very high (or at least higher than normal) and was achieved using a trampoline and trick camera angles. Another well-used effect was 'Supergran walking/running quickly' which usually involved a stunt double walking away from the camera quickly with a 'trailing' visual effect emanating from the retreating figure, making it appear that she was walking/running so fast that her afterimage was momentarily being left behind. To further accentuate the effect, other characters (usually the children and Inventor Black) would be required to 'run' after her, complaining that she was walking/running too quickly.\n\nThe most celebrated effect, featured in episode 1.2 has often been ascribed to the trick camera angles used to make the Skimmer appear to fly. Contrary to fan belief, the prop was not capable of flying but remained grounded throughout the episode – only appearing to take off when driven on the back of a lorry.\n\nThe use of local accents proved problematic – some actors accentuated their own speech to sound more Scottish (and provide continuity with Scottish actors Cuthbertson and Ure) while others were more comfortable with their Geordie accents. The child actors especially found losing their Geordie accents difficult and maintained them across their scenes. The actor who played Tub in Series One even made a catchphrase with his heavy accent – \"What do we dee noo, Unk Ill?\" (\"What do we do now, Uncle?\")\n\nSupergran's most celebrated power is to hear (or 'receive') communications from long-distance if the person is distressed enough. To more clearly 'receive' the communication, Gudrun Ure developed an affectation holding her fingers to her forehead like horns or radio receivers. The director of the first episode liked it so much he suggested she keep it.\n\nSue Sweeney, a local celebrity who featured in many episodes, made firm friends with Gudrun Ure and once claimed the Scottish thespian's acting ability was so high she \"could make you smile, squirm and scream in equal measure without saying a word.\"\n\nSpike Milligan, who guested in a Series One episode, enjoyed his time in nearby Newcastle upon Tyne so much that he became a Newcastle United Season Ticket holder right up to his death.\n\nA third series was planned to begin filming in early 1988 but the programme was abandoned by Tyne Tees Television in favour of increased spending on daytime gameshows such as 'Chain Letters' (which was very popular in the late 1980s).\nSeveral episodes had been plotted and even story-boarded prior to the cancellation and included working titles \"Supergran and the Underwater Terror\" (Supergran would foil Scunner Campbell's plot to destroy Chistleton using a gigantic tidal wave), \"Supergran and the Miniscule Marionette\" (Inventor Black mistakenly miniaturizes a precious marionette heirloom and Supergran must find a way to resize it before an important dignitary arrives to view it) and \"Supergran and the Rhyming Ruin\" (the plot is unknown but would have involved filming in Tynemouth's famous ruined Priory).\n\nThe cancellation of the TV series did not dampen hopes of a motion picture version – hopes which had been alive since midway through the popular Series One. While no firm production plans ever emerged due to the cancellation, one early plot would have involved Supergran travelling to Spain to foil an attempt by Scunner Campbell to control the 'world trade market'.\n\nTynesoft produced two games based on the show in 1985.\n\nThe game \"Super Gran\" was an action game involving Supergran's anti-gravity belt. It was released for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 16, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum.\n\n\"Super Gran - The Adventure\" was a text adventure based on the show, written by Adventure Soft's Brian Howarth. The premise is that Super Gran has to save people whilst looking out for Scunner Campbell. This game was released on the Acorn Electron, BBC Micro, C16, C64 and Spectrum.\n\n"}

This coastal area is called the Riviera delle Palme (Riviera of Palms), which is centred on Savona. To the west is the Riviera dei Fiore (Riviera of Flowers), which stretches from the French border to Cervo. Andora had a population of 7,638 in 2008 ISTAT date which swells to almost 10 times this in the summer months.\n\nThe original town is on a low hill by the left bank of the River Merula where it flows into the sea. Marina di Andora is the development which spread along the coastline from the Middle Ages onwards, first as a fishing and boatbuilding center, then in the last 50 years as a tourist resort. It is from Savona, the main town in the province, from Imperia, from Sanremo and from Genoa. The territory forms part of the Mountain Community of Ingauna. Some of the parishes belonging to Andora include Conna, Colla Micheri, San Bartolomeo, San Pietro, Stellanello and Rollo.\n\nThe first settlement here dates back to the 8th century BC with the Phocaeans escaping from Asia Minor. During the Roman Empire, Castrum Andorae underwent substantial development due to its strategic location on the Via Julia Augusta. After the invasion by the Goths in 951 it formed part of the Marca Alemanica and from 1091 passed to Bonifacio di Vasto. From 1125 the Clavesana family took over and constructed a defensive fortification, mainly to control the means of communication, and enhanced the town with towers, churches and town walls. Due to war the family had to sell the territory and its castle in 1252 to the Republic of Genoa initiating a period of five centuries of peace. In this period olive trees were grown and olive oil produced, fishing was practiced and boat building begun. At the end of the 18th century the area became under the control of Napoleon Bonaparte in the new department of Montenotte. It later fell to the rule of Sardinia and then Italy.\n\nFrom a population of 1,940 in 1861 it grew to 3,328 in 1961 to 6,068 in 1981 and by 2001 had reached 6,767.\n\nThere is a historical nucleus on a hill inland around the remains of the Clavesana Castle which was once home to the governor of Genoa. Just opposite is the chapel of St Nicholas and ruins of some medeviel houses. The church of St James and St. Phillip, which is based on the cathedral in Albenga, was built in local stone with columns and pillars in late Romanesque style. A little further down the hill is the castle tower which was built between 1220 and 1240 and still remains intact.\n\nA bridge on the River Merula with 10 arches is called the \"Roman Bridge\" but it was actually built in the Middle Ages on the site of a pre-existing older structure.\n\nThe San Giovanni Battista St. John the Baptist church, on the right bank of the river near the mediaeval bridge, dates back to the 15th century in the parish of the same name. The complex of old houses further up the hill, Borgata Confredi, was built to house the workers of the olive terraces nearby. From San Giovanni you can still walk along the track of the mediaeval road to Cervo.\n\nIn the centre of Marina di Andora you can still see the bastion built in the 11th century as a defence against the Saracens; it now houses a pizzeria.\n\nOn the way to Laigueglia is the Capo Mele Lighthouse. From Cervo, the main site of Andora is the St.James Church. From Cervo there is a beautiful view of the church and the whole city. A bridge on the Merule River reaches the San Giovanni town which is the most historically city of Andora.\n\nAndora is a popular holiday resort thanks to the long sandy beach and the historical hinterland. Since 1986 Andora has held the Bandiera Blu award for clean waters and beaches. Accommodations include hotels, bed and breakfast establishments and camp sites. There are public and private \"lidos\" offering services such as sunbed, hire, etc. Various water sports are practised including sailing, canoeing, surfing, kite surfing and windsurfing. A diving club Sport 7 is based in the marina and the sailing and canoeing club to the east of the port.\n\nIt has a marina with over 850 moorings, mainly for local boat owners, but 56 places are reserved for tourists in transit to the area. Whale watching trips depart in the summer from the marina.\nApart from water sports there are bowls clubs, tennis clubs and horse riding stables at San Pietro. The area is popular for hiking and mountain biking. The Parco delle Farfalle has a roller skating rink and there is a cycling velodrome in the center.\n\nConcerts are held in the summer in the outdoor arena at the Parco Delle Farfalle as well, in the town center and in the historic setting of the medieval St James and St Phillip Church. There is also an open-air cinema in the summer months.\n\n\"Azzurro pesce d'autore\" (author blue fish) in May is a two-day gastronomic festival celebrating Andora and its commercial activity through two aspects of its territory: the earth and the sea.\n\nThe festival of St. Rita on 22 May in the Piazza Santa Rita (St. Rita's Square) near the sea. Roses are blessed in the chapel dedicated to the saint. It is followed closely by the locals who have strong religious belief in her.\n\nThe festival of St John the Baptist on 24 June is marked by religious festivities and a \"sagra\", a gathering of the local people in the grounds of the church with an outdoor food and wine festival to raise funds for the local community.\n\nThe Beer Festival at the end of June is one of the most popular events in Andora with visitors coming from the north of Italy with live music and a disco in the outdoor arena near the beach.\n\nSeveral regattas for various categories of sailing craft mainly in the summer months.\n\nRollo hosts a Festival of Aromatic Herbs for a weekend at the end of June.\n\nThe main economic activity of Andora is based on beach tourism thanks to it having one of the largest stretches of sandy beach in the western Italian Riviera. In the summer the population reaches 70,000 due to the numerous villas and holiday homes. Most visitors come from Piedmont, Lombardy and the Aosta Valley as well as from overseas.\n\nIt also is an agricultural town with fields of basil grown to make the world-famous pesto sauce, fruits, vegetables, olives for oil and vineyards.\n\nAndora is on the coast road the Via Aurelia. There is an exit for Andora on the A10 motorway between Ventimiglia and Genoa.\n\nThere is a railway station on the Genoa–Ventimiglia line.\n\nThere are buses to Sanremo in the west, and to Finale Ligure in the east.\n\nThe nearest airports are Genoa GOA Cristforo Colombo and Nice NCE Côte d’Azur.\n\nAndora is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1871740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871740", "title": "Ultraviolet index", "text": "Ultraviolet index\n\nThe ultraviolet index or UV Index is an international standard measurement of the strength of sunburn-producing ultraviolet (UV) radiation at a particular place and time. The scale was developed by Canadian scientists in 1992, and then adopted and standardized by the UN's World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization in 1994. It is primarily used in daily forecasts aimed at the general public, and is increasingly available as an hourly forecast as well.\n\nThe UV Index is designed as an open-ended linear scale, directly proportional to the intensity of UV radiation that causes sunburn on human skin. For example, if a light-skinned individual (without sunscreen) begins to sunburn in 30 minutes at UV Index 6, then that individual should expect to sunburn in about 15 minutes at UV Index 12 – twice the UV, twice as fast.\nThe purpose of the UV Index is to help people effectively protect themselves from UV radiation, which has health benefits in moderation but in excess causes sunburn, skin aging, DNA damage, skin cancer, immunosuppression, and eye damage such as cataracts (see the section Human health-related effects of ultraviolet radiation). Public health organizations recommend that people protect themselves (for example, by applying sunscreen to the skin and wearing a hat and sunglasses) if they spend substantial time outdoors when the UV Index is 3 or higher; see the table below for more detailed recommendations.\n\nThe UV Index is a linear scale, with higher values representing a greater risk of sunburn (which is correlated with other health risks) due to UV exposure. An index of 0 corresponds to zero UV radiation, as is essentially the case at night. An index of 10 corresponds roughly to midday summer sunlight with a clear sky when the UV Index was originally designed; now summertime index values in the tens are common for tropical latitudes, mountainous altitudes, and areas with above-average ozone layer depletion.\n\nWhile the UV Index can be calculated from a direct measurement of the UV spectral power at a given location, as some inexpensive portable devices are able to approximate, the value given in weather reports is usually a prediction based on a computer model. Although this may be in error (especially when cloud conditions are unexpectedly heavy or light), it is usually within ±1 UV Index unit as that which would be measured.\n\nWhen the UV Index is presented on a daily basis, it represents UV intensity around the Sun's highest point in the day, called solar noon, halfway between sunrise and sunset. This typically occurs between 11:30 and 12:30, or between 12:30 and 13:30 in areas where daylight saving time is being observed. Predictions are made by a computer model that accounts for the effects of Sun elevation and distance, stratospheric ozone, cloud conditions, air pollutants, surface albedo, and ground altitude, all of which influence the amount of UV radiation at the surface. The calculations are weighted in favor of the UV wavelengths to which human skin is most sensitive, according to the CIE-standard McKinlay-Diffey erythemal action spectrum. The resulting UV Index cannot be expressed in pure physical units, but is a good indicator of likely sunburn damage.\n\nBecause the index scale is linear (and not logarithmic, as is often the case when measuring things such as brightness or sound level), it is reasonable to assume that one hour of exposure at index 5 is approximately equivalent to a half-hour at index 10.\n\nThe UV Index is a number linearly related to the intensity of sunburn-producing UV radiation at a given point on the earth's surface. It cannot be simply related to the irradiance (measured in W/m) because the UV of greatest concern occupies a spectrum of wavelength from 295 to 325 nm, and shorter wavelengths have already been absorbed a great deal when they arrive at the earth's surface. Skin damage from sunburn, however, is related to wavelength, the shorter wavelengths being much more damaging. The UV power spectrum (expressed as watts per square metre per nanometre of wavelength) is therefore multiplied by a weighting curve known as the erythemal action spectrum, and the result integrated over the whole spectrum. This gave Canadian scientists a weighted figure (sometimes called Diffey-weighted UV irradiance, or DUV, or erythemal dose rate) typically around 250 mW/m in midday summer sunlight. So, they arbitrarily divided by 25 mW/m to generate a convenient index value, essentially a scale of 0 to 11+ (though ozone depletion is now resulting in higher values, as mentioned above).\n\nTo illustrate the spectrum weighting principle, the incident power density in midday summer sunlight is typically 0.6 mW/(nm m) at 295 nm, 74 mW/(nm m) at 305 nm, and 478 mW/(nm m) at 325 nm. (Note the huge absorption that has already taken place in the atmosphere at short wavelengths.)\nThe erythemal weighting factors applied to these figures are 1.0, 0.22, and 0.003 respectively. (Also note the huge increase in sunburn damage caused by the shorter wavelengths; e.g., for the same irradiance, 305 nm is 22% as damaging as 295 nm, and 325 nm is 0.3% as damaging as 295 nm.) Integration of these values using all the intermediate weightings over the full spectral range of 290 nm to 400 nm produces a figure of 264 mW/m (the DUV), which is then divided by 25 mW/m to give a UV Index of 10.6.\n\nAfter sporadic attempts by various meteorologists to define a \"sunburn index\", and amid growing concern about ozone depletion, Environment Canada scientists James B. Kerr, C. Thomas McElroy, and David I. Wardle invented the modern UV Index in Toronto, Ontario. Environment Canada launched it as part of the weather forecast on May 27, 1992, making Canada the first country in the world to issue official predictions of UV levels for the next day. Many other countries followed suit with their own UV indices, among them the United States in 1994. Initially, the methods of calculating and reporting a UV Index varied significantly from country to country. A global UV Index, first standardized by the World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization in 1994, gradually replaced the inconsistent regional versions, specifying not only a uniform calculation method (the Canadian definition) but also standard colors and graphics for visual media. In the United States, the WHO standards officially replaced the original US standards in 2004.\n\nOn December 29, 2003, a world-record ground-level UV index of 43.3 was detected at Bolivia's Licancabur volcano, though other scientists dispute readings higher than 26.\n\nIn 2005, the United States and Australia launched the UV Alert. While the two countries have different baseline UV intensity requirements before issuing an alert, their common goal is to raise awareness of the dangers of over-exposure to the Sun on days with intense UV radiation.\n\nIn 2007, the United Nations honored UV Index inventors Kerr, McElroy and Wardle with the Innovators Award for their far-reaching work on reducing public health risks from UV radiation. In the same year, a survey among meteorologists ranked the development of the UV Index as #11 for The Weather Channel's \"100 Biggest Weather Moments\".\n\nWhen the day's predicted UV Index is within various numerical ranges, the recommendations for protection are as follows:\n\nWhen interpreting the UV index and recommendations, be aware that:\n\n\n\n"}

Individuals with HFA may exhibit deficits in areas of communication, emotion recognition and expression and social interaction. HFA is not a recognized diagnosis in the DSM-5 or the ICD-10.\n\nHigh-functioning autism is characterized by features similar to those of Asperger syndrome. The defining characteristic recognized by psychologists is a significant delay in the development of early speech and language skills, before the age of three years. The diagnostic criteria of Asperger syndrome exclude a general language delay.\n\nFurther differences in features between people with high-functioning autism and those with Asperger syndrome, include the following: \n\nIndividuals with autism spectrum disorders, including high-functioning autism, risk developing symptoms of anxiety. While anxiety is one of the most commonly occurring mental health symptoms, children and adolescents with high functioning autism are at an even greater risk of developing symptoms.\n\nThere are other comorbidities, the presence of one or more disorders in addition to the primary disorder, associated with high-functioning autism. Some of these include bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). In particular the link between HFA and OCD, has been studied; both have abnormalities associated with serotonin.\n\nObservable comorbidities associated with HFA include ADHD and Tourette syndrome. HFA does not cause nor include intellectual disabilities. This characteristic distinguishes HFA from low-functioning autism; between 40 and 55% of individuals with autism also have an intellectual disability.\n\nAn association between HFA and criminal behavior is not completely characterized. Several studies have shown that the features associated with HFA may increase the probability of engaging in criminal behavior. While there is still a great deal of research that needs to be done in this area, recent studies on the correlation between HFA and criminal actions suggest that there is a need to understand the attributes of HFA that may lead to violent behavior. There have been several case studies that link the lack of empathy and social naïveté associated with HFA to criminal actions.\n\nAlthough little is known about the biological basis of autism, studies have revealed structural abnormalities in specific brain regions. Regions identified in the \"social\" brain include the amygdala, superior temporal sulcus, fusiform gyrus area and orbitofrontal cortex. Further abnormalities have been observed in the caudate nucleus, believed to be involved in restrictive behaviors, as well as in a significant increase in the amount of cortical grey matter and atypical connectivity between brain regions.\n\nThere is a mistaken belief that some vaccinations, such as the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, may cause autism. This was based on a research study published by Andrew Wakefield, which has been determined fraudulent and retracted. The results of this study caused some parents to take their children off vaccines clinically proven to prevent diseases that can cause intellectual disabilities or death. The claim that some vaccinations cause autism has not been proven; multiple large-scale epidemiological studies conducted in Japan, the United States, and other countries do not support this link.\n\nWhile high-functioning autism was never an official diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association, it was a classification in the DSM-4 for individuals with autistic disorder but do not have an intellectual disability (an IQ of 70 or more). In the present diagnostic standards of the DSM-5 the classification of HFA is no longer used and has been replaced by 3 support levels for autism spectrum disorders. Typically cases of high-functioning autism are diagnosed by 35 months of age, much earlier than those of Asperger syndrome; this is possibly due to the delay in speech and language development. Some characteristics used to diagnose an individual with autism include persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction, along with restrictive, and repetitive patterns of behavior.\n\nWhile there exists no single treatment or medicine for people with autism, there exists several strategies to help lessen the symptoms and effects of the condition.\n\nAugmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is used for autistic patients who cannot communicate orally. Patients who have problems speaking may be taught to use other forms of communication, such as body language, computers, interactive devices, and pictures. The picture exchange communication system (PECS) is a commonly used form of augmentative and alternative communication with children and adults who cannot communicate well orally. Patients are taught how to link pictures and symbols to their feelings, desires and observation, and may be able to link sentences together with the vocabulary that they form.\n\nSpeech-language therapy can help those with autism who need to develop or improve communication skills. According to the organization Autism Speaks, “speech-language therapy is designed to coordinate the mechanics of speech with the meaning and social use of speech”. People with autism may have issues with communication, or speaking spoken words. Speech-language Pathologists (SLP) may teach someone how to communicate more effectively with others or work on starting to develop speech patterns. The SLP will create a plan that focuses on what the child needs.\n\nOccupational therapy helps autistic children and adults learn everyday skills that help them with daily tasks, such as personal hygiene and movement. These skills are then integrated into their home, school, and work environments. Therapists will oftentimes help patients learn to adapt their environment to their skill level. This type of therapy could help autistic people become more engaged in their environment. An occupational therapist will create a plan based on the patient's’ needs and desires and work with them to achieve their set goals.\n\nApplied behavioral analysis (ABA) is considered the most effective therapy for autism spectrum disorders by the American Academy of Pediatrics. ABA focuses on teaching adaptive behaviors like social skills, play skills, or communication skills and diminishing problematic behaviors like eloping or self-injury by creating a specialized plan that uses behavioral therapy techniques, such as positive or negative reinforcement, to encourage or discourage certain behaviors over-time.\n\nSensory integration therapy helps people with autism adapt to different kinds of sensory stimuli. Many with autism can be oversensitive to certain stimuli, such as lights or sounds, causing them to overreact. Others may not react to certain stimuli, such as someone speaking to them. Many types of therapy activities involve a form of play, such as using swings, toys and trampolines to help engage the patients with sensory stimuli. Therapists will create a plan that focuses on the type of stimulation the person needs integration with.\n\nThere are no medications specifically designed to treat autism. Medication is usually used for symptoms associated with autism, such as depression, anxiety, or behavioral problems. Medicines are usually used after other alternative forms of treatment have failed.\n\nMany autistic rights activists disagree with the categorisation of individuals into \"high-functioning autism\" and \"low-functioning autism\", stating that the \"low-functioning\" label causes people to put low expectations on a child and view them as lesser. Furthermore, critics of functioning labels state that an individual's functioning can fluctuate from day to day, and categories do not take this into consideration.\n\n"}
{"id": "1871755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871755", "title": "Slot antenna", "text": "Slot antenna\n\nA slot antenna consists of a metal surface, usually a flat plate, with one or more holes or slots cut out. A slotted waveguide is a waveguide that is used as an antenna in microwave radar applications. When the plate is driven as an antenna by a driving frequency, the slot radiates electromagnetic waves in a way similar to a dipole antenna. The shape and size of the slot, as well as the driving frequency, determine the radiation pattern. Often the radio waves are provided by a waveguide, and the antenna consists of slots in the waveguide. Slot antennas are usually used at UHF and microwave frequencies, where the waves are usually conducted by waveguide, so a slot in the waveguide makes a simple antenna. They are often found in standard desktop microwave sources used for research purposes. A slot antenna's main advantages are its size, design simplicity, and convenient adaptation to mass production using either waveguide or PC board technology.\n\nAn antenna consisting of multiple parallel slots in a waveguide is a widely used array antenna which radiates a narrow fan-shaped beam of microwaves at right angles to the waveguide, with its narrow axis in the plane of the waveguide and its wide axis perpendicular to the waveguide. Multiple slot versions are widely used in radar antennas, particularly marine radar antennas on ships, and for the sector antennas used for cell phone base stations.\n\nDue to Babinet's principle a slot in a waveguide has the same radiation pattern as a driven rod antenna whose rod is the same shape as the slot. This can be used to determine the radiation pattern using calculations for a more conventional antenna.\n\nUsually a slotted waveguide antenna is protected by microwave transparent material, which may visually obscure the slots. Nevertheless, it is easily distinguished from a parabolic reflector by its flat or tube shape. The wave guide contains slits with size of about 1/4 wavelength, in a distance of 1/2 wavelength.\n\nThe slot antenna was invented in 1938 by Alan Blumlein, while working for EMI. He invented it in order to produce a practical type of antenna for VHF television broadcasting that would have horizontal polarization, an omnidirectional horizontal radiation pattern and a narrow vertical radiation pattern.\n\nPrior to its use in surface search radar, such systems used a parabolic segment reflector. The slotted waveguide antenna was the result of collaborative radar research carried on by McGill University and the National Research Council of Canada during World War II. The co-inventors, W.H. Watson and E.W. Guptill of McGill, were granted a United States patent for the device, described as a \"directive antenna for microwaves\", in 1951.\n\nFor comparison, in the parabolic type of antenna a feedhorn at the end of a waveguide directs a conical beam of output energy toward the reflector, whence it is focused into a narrow collimated beam. Reflected energy from the environment follows the reverse path and is focused by the reflector onto the feed horn where it travels back to the receiver. The reflector must be built to a precision determined by the wavelength used. For a one centimeter wavelength, a reflector precision of one or two millimeters would be adequate.\nA slotted waveguide has no reflector but emits directly through the slots. The spacing of the slots is critical and is a multiple of the wavelength used for transmission and reception. The effect of this geometry is to form a high gain antenna that is highly directional in the plane of the antenna. Without augmentation a slotted waveguide is not as efficient as a parabolic reflector, lacking an ability to focus in the vertical plane, but is much more durable and is less expensive to construct. The antenna's vertical focus is usually enhanced by the application of a microwave lens attached to the front of the antenna. As this, like the companion slotted waveguide, is a one-dimensional device, it too may be made relatively cheaply as compared to a parabolic reflector and feedhorn.\n\nIn a related application, so-called \"leaky waveguides\" are also used in the determination of railcar positions in certain rapid transit applications. They are used primarily to determine the precise position of the train when it is being brought to a halt at a station, so that the doorway positions will align correctly with queuing points on the platform or with a second set of safety doors should such be provided.\n\n\n"}

In 2006 he became a Fellow of the British Academy.\n\nIn 2005 a festschrift was published dedicated to Dunn, comprising articles by 27 New Testament scholars, examining early Christian communities and their beliefs about the Holy Spirit in Christianity. In 2009 another festschrift was dedicated to Dunn for his 70th birthday, consisting of two forewords by N. T. Wright and Richard B. Hays and 17 articles all written by his former students who went on to have successful careers in either academic and ministerial fields around the world.\n\nDunn is especially associated with the New Perspective on Paul, along with N. T. Wright and E. P. Sanders.\n\nDunn has taken up Sanders' project of redefining Palestinian Judaism in order to correct the Christian view of Judaism as a religion of works-righteousness. One of the most important differences to Sanders is that Dunn perceives a fundamental coherence and consistency to Paul's thought. He furthermore criticizes Sanders' understanding of the term \"justification\", arguing that Sanders' understanding suffers from an \"individualizing exegesis\".\n\nDunn has written or edited numerous books and papers, including:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1871804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871804", "title": "Ballona Creek", "text": "Ballona Creek\n\nBallona Creek is an waterway in southwestern Los Angeles County, California, whose watershed drains the Los Angeles basin, from the Santa Monica Mountains on the north, the Harbor Freeway (I-110) on the east, and the Baldwin Hills on the south. It heads in the historical Rancho Las Cienegas and flows through Culver City and the Del Rey district before emptying into Santa Monica Bay between Marina del Rey and the Playa del Rey district.\n\nDuring the Pre-Columbian era, Tongva people existed as hunters and gatherers in small villages throughout the Ballona Creek watershed and other parts of the Los Angeles basin. Native American culture and land management practice was disrupted by the arrival of Spanish explorers.\n\nIn 1769, the Tongva met their first Europeans when Portola expedition came through on its way north. Continuing west after crossing the Los Angeles River, diarist Fray Juan Crespi noted that the party \"came across a grove of very large alders...from which flows a stream of water...The water flowed afterwards in a deep channel towards the southwest\". Researchers identified the place as the headwaters of Ballona Creek. The explorers made camp nearby on August 3.\n\nAround 1820, a mestizo rancher named Augustine Machado began grazing his cattle on the Ballona wetlands and claimed a fourteen-thousand acre Mexican land grant that stretched from modern-day Culver City to Pico Boulevard in Santa Monica, California. Ballona Creek and Lagoon are named for the Ballona or Paseo de las Carretas land grant, dated November 27, 1839. The Machado and Talamantes families, co-grantees of the rancho, heralded from Baiona in northern Spain. After the land grant claims were lost, the area then experienced rapid growth, with open land being transformed into agricultural use.\n\nThe Ballona Creek watershed totals about . Its land use consists of 64% residential, 8% commercial, 4% industrial, and 17% open space. The major tributaries to the Ballona Creek and Estuary include Centinela Creek, Sepulveda Canyon Channel and Benedict Canyon Channel; most of the creek's minor tributaries have been destroyed by development or paved over and flow into Ballona Creek as a network of underground storm drains.\n\nAt the time of Spanish settlement, the Los Angeles River turned to the west just south of present-day Bunker Hill, joining Ballona Creek just to the west of its current channel. However, during a major flood in 1825, the Los Angeles River's course changed to its present channel, and Ballona Creek became a completely distinct waterway. Much of the above-ground section of the creek was lined with concrete as part of the flood-control project undertaken by the United States Army Corps of Engineers following the Los Angeles Flood of 1938.\n\nBallona Creek Watershed climate can be characterized as Mediterranean with average annual rainfall of approximately 15 inches per year over most of the developed portions of the watershed. The flow rate in the Creek varies considerably from a trickle flow of about per second during dry weather to per second during a 50-year storm event. Ballona Wetlands and Del Rey Lagoon are connected to the Ballona Estuary through tide gates.\n\nFrom northern source to southern mouth (year built in parentheses):\n\n\nThe historic wetland complex at the mouth of Ballona Creek probably occupied about 2000 acres. Although much of it was drained and developed, a portion remains protected. The State of California owns 600 acres of the former wetlands; the CDFW (California Department of Fish and Wildlife) owns 540 acres, and the State Lands Commission owns 60 acres, including a newly created freshwater marsh. Much of these preserved lands are designated as the Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve and despite historic degradation, conditions are improving. Wetland flora includes pickleweed, marsh heather, saltgrass, arrowgrass and glasswort, and a variety of upland and exotic species including brome, iceplant, oxalis, and ryegrass. Bird species of special interest observed in the reserve include nesting pairs of Belding's Savannah sparrow (\"Passerculus rostratus/sandwichensis beldingi\") and foraging use by California least terns (\"Sterna antillarum browni\").\n\nThe urbanization of the watershed, and associated with it the pollution of urban runoff and stormwater, has degraded the water quality in Ballona Creek and its Estuary. Ballona Creek is listed by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board impaired for fecal coliform, heavy metals, and pesticides. Dry weather urban runoff and storm water, both conveyed by storm drains, are the primary sources of pollutions in the Creek.\n\nMany national, historical, archeological and cultural landmarks, tourist attractions, educational institutions, businesses and industries exist in Ballona Creek Watershed. With year-round Mediterranean climate, the area attracts immigrants and visitors from all over the world making Ballona Creek Watershed a vibrant melting pot of culture. A bike path that extends almost seven miles from National Boulevard in Culver City to the end of Ballona Creek Estuary provides opportunities for recreation in the area. Ballona Creek Estuary and Ballona Wetlands provide habitat to many species of waterfowls, shorebirds, and waders.\n\nIn the 1997 movie \"Volcano\", Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones) dropped a 20-story apartment building in a controlled demolition in order to divert a flowing river of lava into Ballona Creek and thus into the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1871808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871808", "title": "Danza", "text": "Danza\n\nDanza is a musical genre that originated in Ponce, a city in southern Puerto Rico. It is a popular turn-of-the-twentieth-century ballroom dance genre slightly similar to the waltz. Both the danza and its cousin the contradanza are sequence dances, performed to a pattern, usually of squares, to music that was instrumental. Neither the contradanza nor the danza were sung genres; this is a contrast to, for example, the habanera, which was a sung genre. There is some dispute as to whether the danza was in any sense a different dance from the contradanza, or whether it was just a simplification of the name. Through the first part of the 19th century the dance and its music became steadily more creolized. The music and the dance is creolized because composers were consciously trying to integrate African and European ideas because many of the people themselves were creoles, that is, born in the Caribbean; accepting their islands as their true and only homeland.\n\nSome well-known composers of danzas are Manuel Gregorio Tavárez, \"The Father of Puerto Rican Danza\", and Juan Morel Campos, considered by many to have raised the genre to its highest level. Others are Cuban Ignacio Cervantes, and Curaçaoan Jan Gerard Palm.\n\nDanza is a form of music that can be varied in its expression. The Puerto Rican national anthem, \"La Borinqueña\", was originally a danza that was later altered to fit a more anthem-like style. Danzas can be either romantic or festive. Romantic danzas have four sections, beginning with an eight-measure \"paseo\" followed by three themes of sixteen measures each. The third theme typically includes a solo by the bombardino (baritone horn) and, often, a return to the first theme or a coda at the end. Festive danzas are free-form, with the only rules being an introduction and a swift rhythm.\n\nThe first part of the romantic danza, the \"paseo\", had 8 measures of music without a fixed rhythm (a snare drumroll may be played as background), when the couples circled the room elegantly, giving the lady the opportunity to display her beauty. The second part, called the \"merengue\", grew from the original 16 measures to 34, in 1854. Here the couples held each other in a proper stance and executed turns that looked very much like a waltz.\n\nWhile the origins of the danza are murky, it probably arose around 1840 as a sort of reaction against the highly codified contradanza and, according to Cuban sources, was strongly influenced by Cuban immigrants and their habanera music. The first danzas were immature, youthful songs condemned by the authorities, who occasionally tried ineffectively to ban the genre.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, the genre continued evolving until it was taken up by the young pianist Manuel Gregorio Tavárez, who had just arrived from his studies in Paris, and took it to a new artistic level. His disciple, Juan Morel Campos, adopted it also and developed it further to its maximum expression, composing more than 300 danzas, most of them masterpieces of an exquisite beauty. The danza that evolved was inspired mostly by women and romance and their titles reflected that change.\n\n\n"}
