He lived and worked in Santa Monica and Venice, California.\n\nInitially a painter, Baldessari began to incorporate texts and photography into his canvases in the mid-1960s. In 1970 he began working in printmaking, film, video, installation, sculpture and photography. He created thousands of works which demonstrate—and, in many cases, combine—the narrative potential of images and the associative power of language within the boundaries of the work of art. His art has been featured in more than 200 solo exhibitions in the U.S. and Europe. His work influenced that of Cindy Sherman, David Salle, Annette Lemieux, and Barbara Kruger among others.\n\n\nBaldessari was born in National City, California, to Hedvig Marie Jensen (1896-1950), a Danish nurse, and Antonio Baldessari (1877-1976), an Italian salvage dealer. Baldessari and his elder sister were raised in Southern California. He attended Sweetwater High School and San Diego State College. Between 1960 and 1984, he was married to Montessorian teacher Carol Ann Wixom; they have two children.\n\nIn 1959, Baldessari began teaching art in the San Diego school system. He kept teaching for nearly three decades, in schools and junior colleges and community colleges, and eventually at the university level. When the University of California decided to open up a campus in San Diego, the new head of the Visual Art Department, Paul Brach, asked Baldessari to be part of the originating faculty in 1968. At UCSD he shared an office with David Antin. In 1970, Baldessari moved to Santa Monica, where he met many artists and writers, and began teaching at CalArts. His first classes included David Salle, Jack Goldstein, Mike Kelley, Ken Feingold, Tony Oursler, James Welling, Barbara Bloom, Matt Mullican, and Troy Brauntuch. While at CalArts, Baldessari taught \"the infamous Post Studio class\", which he intended to \"indicate people not daubing away at canvases or chipping away at stone, that there might be some other kind of class situation.\" The class, which operated outside of medium-specificity, was influential in informing the context for addressing a student's art practice at CalArts, and established a tradition of conceptual critique at CalArts that was carried on by artists such as Michael Asher. He quit teaching at CalArts in 1986, moving on to teach at UCLA, which he continued until 2008. At UCLA, his students included Elliott Hundley and Analia Saban.\n\nBy 1966, Baldessari was using photographs and text, or simply text, on canvas. His early major works were canvas paintings that were empty but for painted statements derived from contemporary art theory. An early attempt of Baldessari's included the hand-painted phrase \"Suppose it is true after all? WHAT THEN?\" (1967) on a heavily worked painted surface. However, this proved personally disappointing because the form and method conflicted with the objective use of language that he preferred to employ. Baldessari decided the solution was to remove his own hand from the construction of the image and to employ a commercial, lifeless style so that the text would impact the viewer without distractions. The words were then physically lettered by sign painters, in an unornamented black font. The first of this series presented the ironic statement \"A TWO-DIMENSIONAL SURFACE WITHOUT ANY ARTICULATION IS A DEAD EXPERIENCE\" (1967).\n\nAnother work, \"Painting for Kubler\" (1967–68) presented the viewer theoretical instructions on how to view it and on the importance of context and continuity with previous works. This work referenced art historian George Kubler's seminal book, \"\". The seemingly legitimate art concerns were intended by Baldessari to become hollow and ridiculous when presented in such a purely self-referential manner.\n\nIn 1970, Baldessari and five friends burnt all of the paintings he had created between 1953 and 1966 as part of a new piece, titled \"The Cremation Project\". The ashes from these paintings were baked into cookies and placed into an urn, and the resulting art installation consists of a bronze commemorative plaque with the destroyed paintings' birth and death dates, as well as the recipe for making the cookies. Through the ritual of cremation Baldessari draws a connection between artistic practice and the human life cycle. Thus the act of disavowal becomes generative as with the work of auto-destructive artist Jean Tinguely.\n\nBaldessari is best known for works that blend photographic materials (such as film stills), take them out of their original context and rearrange their form, often including the addition of words or sentences. Related to his early text paintings were his \"Wrong\" series (1966–1968), which paired photographic images with lines of text from an amateur photography book, aiming at the violation of a set of basic \"rules\" on snapshot composition. In one of the works, Baldessari had himself photographed in front of a palm precisely so that it would appear that the tree were growing out of his head. His photographic \"California Map Project\" (1969) created physical forms that resembled the letters in \"California\" geographically near to the very spots on the map that they were printed. In the \"Binary Code Series\", Baldessari used images as information holders by alternating photographs to stand in for the on-off state of binary code; one example alternated photos of a woman holding a cigarette parallel to her mouth and then dropping it away.\n\nAnother of Baldessari's series juxtaposed an image of an object such as a glass, or a block of wood, and the phrase \"A glass is a glass\" or \"Wood is wood\" combined with \"but a cigar is a good smoke\" and the image of the artist smoking a cigar. These directly refer to René Magritte's \"The Treachery of Images\"; the images similarly were used to stand in for the objects described. However, the series also apparently refers to Sigmund Freud's famous attributed observation that \"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar\", as well as to Rudyard Kipling's \"… a woman is only a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke.\"\n\nIn \"Double Bill\", a 2012 series of large inkjet prints, Baldessari paired the work of two selected artists (such as Giovanni di Paolo with David Hockney, or Fernand Léger with Max Ernst) on a single canvas, further altering the appropriated picture plane by overlaying his own hand-painted color additions. Baldessari then names only one of his two artistic \"collaborators\" on each canvas's lower edge, such as \"…AND MANET\" or \"…AND DUCHAMP\".\n\nBaldessari has expressed that his interest in language comes from its similarities in structure to games, as both operate by an arbitrary and mandatory system of rules. In this spirit, many of his works are sequences showing attempts at accomplishing an arbitrary goal, such as \"Throwing Three Balls in the Air to Get a Straight Line\" (1973), in which the artist attempted to do just that, photographing the results, and eventually selecting the \"best out of 36 tries\", with 36 being the determining number just because that is the standard number of shots on a roll of 35mm film. The writer eldritch Priest ties John Baldessari's piece \"Throwing four balls in the air to get a square (best of 36 tries)\" as an early example of post-conceptual art. This work was published in 1973 by a young Italian publisher: Giampaolo Prearo that was one of the first to believe and invest in the work of Baldessari. He printed two series one in 2000 copies and a second more precious reserved to the publisher in 500 copies. Following Baldessari's seminal statement \"I will not make any more boring Art\", he conceived the work \"The Artist Hitting Various Objects with a Golf Club\" (1972–73), composed of 30 photographs of the artist swinging and hitting with a golf club objects excavated from a dump, as a parody of cataloging rather than a thorough straight classification.\n\nMuch of Baldessari's work involves pointing, in which he tells the viewer not only what to look at but how to make selections and comparisons, often simply for the sake of doing so. Baldessari's \"Commissioned Paintings\" (1969) series took the idea of pointing literally, after he read a criticism of conceptual art that claimed it was nothing more than pointing. Beginning with photos of a hand pointing at various objects, Baldessari then hired amateur yet technically adept artists to paint the pictures. He then added a caption \"A painting by [painter's name]\" to each finished painting. In this instance, he has been likened to a choreographer, directing the action while having no direct hand in it, and these paintings are typically read as questioning the idea of artistic authorship. The amateur artists have been analogized to sign painters in this series, chosen for their pedestrian methods that were indifferent to what was being painted. Baldessari critiques formalist assessments of art in a segment from his video \"How We Do Art Now\" (1973), entitled \"Examining Three 8d Nails\", in which he gives obsessive attention to minute details of the nails, such as how much rust they have, or descriptive qualities such as which appears \"cooler, more distant, less important\" than the others.\n\nCircular adhesive dots covering up the faces of photographed and painted portraits are a prevailing motif in Baldessari's work from the mid-1980s onward. The artist himself suspected that, despite the broad array of approaches he's taken over the course of his career, he will be best remembered as \"the guy who puts dots over peoples faces.\" Examples of the \"dot portraits\" would include—for example—\"Bloody Sunday\" (1987) or \"Stonehenge with Two Persons\" (2005), though these works are numerous and it is difficult to identify an exemplar. The dots in these paintings evoke brightly colored price-stickers sometimes seen at garage sales, thrift stores or placed on retail items during a sale. Indeed, these stickers appear to have been the inspiration for the method. Describing his initial intuitive leap in this direction, Baldessari said, \"I just had these price stickers I was using for something else, in some graphic way and I put them on all the faces and I just felt like it leveled the playing field.\" The dot-faced works may sometimes be described as paintings, collages, or may be released as print editions.\n\nBaldessari began making prints in the early 1970s and continued to produce editions. He created his first print – \"I Will Not Make Any More Boring Art\" (1971) - as an edition to raise funds for the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Halifax. The lithograph was created in conjunction with the now renowned exhibition for which – at Baldessari's request – students endlessly wrote the phrase \"I will not make any more boring art\" on the gallery walls. The artist has since worked internationally with premier publishers including Arion Press of San Francisco, Brook Alexander Editions of New York, Cirrus Editions of Los Angeles, Crown Point Press of San Francisco, Edition Jacob Samuel of Santa Monica, Gemini G.E.L. of Los Angeles, Mixografia of Los Angeles, Multiples, Multi Editions of Los Angeles, Inc. of New York, and Peter Blum Editions of New York. His 1988 prints, \"The Fallen Easel\" and \"Object (with Flaw)\", represented a major shift in Baldessari's approach to presentation, allowing a more complex relationship between his found imagery. In both prints, Baldessari expertly contrasts unrelated photographs to suggest a mysterious and/or ominous undercurrent. In the 1990s Baldessari began working with Mixografia Workshop to create three-dimensional prints utilizing their unique process of printing from metal molds. Baldessari's interest in dimensionality has carried over to recent editions from Gemini G.E.L., including the \"Person with Guitar\" series (2005) and the print series \"Noses & Ears, Etc.\" (2006–2007) in which screen-printed images are constructed in three layers on sintra with hand painting. A 2007 publication from Gemini is \"God Nose\", a cast aluminum piece that is designed to hang from the ceiling. Baldessari also contributed to the 2008 Artists for Obama portfolio, a set of prints in a limited edition of 150 published by Gemini G.E.L..\n\nOriginally conceived in 1970, \"Unrealised Proposal for Cadavre Piece\" would have visitors look through a peep-hole and see a dead male body laid out with its feet towards them inside a climate-controlled vitrine, made to resemble Andrea Mantegna’s painting, \"The Lamentation over the Dead Christ\" (1480). Hans Ulrich Obrist, the co-director of London’s Serpentine Gallery and Klaus Biesenbach, the director of MoMA PS1, first attempted to realize Baldessari’s idea in 2011 and the resulting paperwork of failed attempts to procure a willing male cadaver was displayed in the exhibition \"11 Rooms\" at the Manchester International Festival.\n\nBaldessari's film \"Police Drawing\" documents a 1971 performance, \"Police Drawing Project\". In this piece, the artist walked into a class of art students who had never seen him, set up a video camera to document the proceedings, and left the room. Subsequently, a police artist entered and, based on the students' testimony, sketched a likeness of the artist. In the black-and-white video \"I Am Making Art\" (1971), Baldessari stands facing the camera; for nearly 20 minutes, he strikes and then holds various poses — crossing his arms over his chest or swinging one arm out to one side or pointing directly at the lens, for example — and with each new gesture, he states \"I am making art.\" In a 1972 tribute to fellow artist Sol LeWitt, Baldessari sang lines from LeWitt's thirty-five statements on conceptual art to the tune of popular songs. Other films include \"Teaching a Plant the Alphabet\" and the \"Inventory\" videos, also from 1972.\n\nA riff on his 1977 color video \"Six Colourful Inside Jobs\", in \"Thirteen Colorful Inside Jobs\" (2013) a room is repainted by a performer in a different colour every day for the duration of the exhibition, carefully following the instructions of the artist.\n\nBaldessari created his first ever sculpture, \"Beethoven's Trumpet (with Ear) Opus\" \"# 127, 130, 131, 132, 133, 135\" (2007), a series of 6 resin, fiberglass, bronze, aluminum, and electronics components in the form of a gigantic bronze trumpet extending off an oversized ear sculpted on the wall. The sculpture was produced with Beyer Projects. When the viewer speaks into the trumpet, the sounds causes a short recital of a phrase from a Beethoven string quartet. Baldessari has gone on to create sculptural works that often incorporate resin, bronze, and steel, such as the approximately 2.4 m carrot (\"Fake Carrot\", 2016) and an elongated bronze figure trapped wearing a wooden barrel in a nod to Giacometti (\"Giacometti Variation\", 2018).\n\nBaldessari has been in over 200 solo shows and 1,000 group shows in his six-decade career. He had his first gallery solo exhibition at the Molly Barnes Gallery in Los Angeles in 1968. His first retrospective exhibition in the U.S. in 1981 was mounted by the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, and traveled to the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, the CAM, Houston, the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, and the Museum Folkwang, Essen.\n\nHis work has since been exhibited in:\n\nSolo presentations of his work at museums have included exhibitions at:\n\nRetrospectives of his work was shown at MOCA, Los Angeles, which traveled to SFMOMA, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Whitney Museum and the Musée d'Art Contemporain, Montreal in 1990-92; at Cornerhouse, Manchester, and traveled to London, Stuttgart, Ljubljana, Oslo, and Lisbon in 1995-96 entitled \"This Not That\"; and \"Pure Beauty\" opened at the Tate Modern, London, in 2009 and travelled to MACBA, Barcelona; LACMA, Los Angeles; and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, through 2011.\n\nThere was an \"Artist's Choice: John Baldessari\" at the Museum of Modern Art in 1994, and the artist was invited to curate the exhibition \"Ways of Seeing: John Baldessari Explores the Collection\" at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in 2006, and he created the exhibition design for \"Magritte and Contemporary Art: The Treachery of Images\" at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n\nFor the 2017/2018 season at the Vienna State Opera he designed the large-scale image (176 m²) \"Graduation\" for the ongoing series \"Safety Curtain\", conceived by museum in progress.\n\nBaldessari's works are part of major public and private collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden and the Broad Collection.\n\n\nBaldessari has been the recipient of numerous awards, among others:\n\n\nIn 2013, the California Institute of the Arts opened its John Baldessari Art Studio Building, which features approximately 7,000 square feet of space—much of it used as studio space for art students and faculty.\n\n\nBaldessari set a personal auction record when his acrylic-on-canvas piece \"Quality Material\" (1966–1968) was sold for $4,408,000 at Christie's New York in 2007.\n\nIn 1972, Ileana Sonnabend agreed to represent him worldwide. In 1999, after twenty-six years with the Sonnabend Gallery, Baldessari went to Marian Goodman. He has also been represented by Margo Leavin (1984-2013), and Sprüth Magers (since 1998)\n\n\n"}

After his father, James, died in 1888, George Poage, along with his mother and surviving sibling, moved into the home of Mary and Lucian Easton; Lucian was the son of local lumberman Jason Easton, who employed James in his stables.\n\nAt La Crosse High School Poage excelled as both a student and an athlete; he was considered the top athlete at the school and, in 1899, was the class salutatorian, becoming the school's first African-American graduate.\n\nThe following fall he became a freshman at the University of Wisconsin. After competing with the freshman track squad in 1900, he joined the varsity track and field team during his sophomore year. Poage was the first black athlete to run for UW, specializing in the short sprints and hurdles. A consistent point winner for his team, he quickly became well respected. When the track coach was called out of town in 1902, he placed Poage in charge of the team in his absence.\n\nPoage graduated in 1903 with a degree in History. His senior thesis was titled \"An Investigation into the Economic Condition of the Negro in the State of Georgia During the Period of 1860–1900\". He returned to the University for the 1903–04 school year to take graduate classes in History, supported by the UW athletic department, which hired him as an athletic trainer for the football team. In June 1904, he became the first African-American individual Big Ten track champion in conference history, placing first in both the 440-yard dash and the 220-yard hurdles.\n\nThe Milwaukee Athletic Club sponsored Poage to compete in the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri. Many prominent African-American leaders had called for a boycott of the games to protest racial segregation of the events in St. Louis. An integrated audience was not allowed at either the Olympics or the World's Fair as the organizers had built segregated facilities for the spectators. Poage chose to compete in four events and became the first African-American to medal in the Games by winning the bronze in both the 200-yard and 400-yard hurdles.\n\nPoage remained in St. Louis after the Olympics, working as a school principal for a year before becoming a teacher at segregated Charles Sumner High School. At Sumner, he was the head of the English department, teaching English composition, literature, and Latin, helped coach the school’s sports teams, and supervised various extracurricular activities such as debate and theater. In 1914, Poage left his job at Sumner. According to a former student, he purchased to a farm in Minnesota, although no land records of the purchase have been found. Local historian Margaret Lichter and Bruce Mouser have speculated that the land was owned by the Easton family.\n\nIn 1920, Poage moved to Chicago. He worked in a restaurant for four years. In 1924, Poage was hired by the United States Postal Service and worked as a postal clerk for nearly thirty years. After his retirement in the 1950s he remained in Chicago until his death in 1962.\n\nPoage was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nIn 2013, the La Crosse City Council renamed Hood Park to George C. Poage Park in Poage's honor.\n"}

The phenomenon has been noted in \"The New York Times\", which once published as many as 14 \"bus plunge\" stories per year in its foreign news section.\n\nThe stories exist not only because of their perceived newsworthiness but because they could be reduced to a few lines and used to fill gaps in the page layout. Further, the words \"bus\" and \"plunge\" are short, and can be used in one-column headlines within the narrow, eight-column format that was prevalent in newspapers through the first half of the 20th century.\n\nThe adoption of computerized layout tools has reduced the need for such filler stories, but news wires continue to carry them.\n\n"}

An expression cassette comprises three components: a promoter sequence, an open reading frame, and a 3' untranslated region that, in eukaryotes, usually contains a polyadenylation site.\n\nDifferent expression cassettes can be transfected into different organisms including bacteria, yeast, plants, and mammalian cells as long as the correct regulatory sequences are used.\n\n"}

He was influenced by Max Gluckman and conducted important research on social network analysis at the University of Manchester (see Manchester School). In the 1940s he carried out field research into social systems and social conditions in Central Africa (southern Malawi) interviewing heads of households in villages and urban areas and observing customs. In 1952 he was on the editorial committee of the \"Northern Rhodesia Journal\".\n\nMitchell studied network analysis and was a founding member of the International Network for Social Network Analysis, contributing to its \"Connections\" magazine.\n"}
{"id": "2008289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008289", "title": "Based on a True Story (The Starting Line album)", "text": "Based on a True Story (The Starting Line album)\n\nBased on a True Story is the second studio album by American pop punk band the Starting Line. The group's label Drive-Thru Records had a distribution deal which allowed MCA Records to acquire their bands. After MCA Records was absorbed into Geffen Records in mid-2003, the band spent most of 2004 writing and demoing songs for their next album. Following pre-production in July 2004, the band began recording for \"Based on a True Story\", finishing in September. The album was recorded at various studios in New York state and California. Separate sessions were produced by Tim O'Heir, Howard Benson and Eric Rachel.\n\nPrior to the album's release, \"Bedroom Talk\" was issued as a single in April 2005, and the band went on tour debuting a handful of songs from the album. \"Based on a True Story\" was released through Drive-Thru and Geffen Records on May 10. Peaking at number 18 on the \"Billboard\" 200, the album received mixed to positive reviews. Following its release, the band went on the Warped Tour throughout the summer. While on the tour, a music video was released for \"Bedroom Talk\". Soon after, Geffen de-prioritized the album, which resulted in the band leaving the label in December. Further tours in the UK and the US followed.\n\nThe Starting Line formed in 1999, signing with independent label Drive-Thru Records shortly afterwards. The band's debut album \"Say It Like You Mean It\", released in July 2002, was a joint release by Drive-Thru and major label MCA Records. MCA's distribution deal allowed it to acquire Drive-Thru Records' bands over a period of time. By the time the group sold around 300,000 copies, the band was signed to MCA Records, who saw the group's potential. Vocalist Kenny Vasoli said they were content with the label, based on the label's success with contemporaries New Found Glory and Blink-182. Following the conclusion of a US tour with Sum 41 in April 2003, the band took a brief break before they started writing for their next album.\n\n\"Say It Like You Mean It\" lone single \"The Best of Me\" received attention from MTV2, and was to be released to radio while the group performed on the Warped Tour in the summer. However, MCA Records was absorbed by Universal Music Group (UMG) subsidiary Geffen Records in mid-2003, which resulted in its staff and roster being moved to Geffen. According to guitarist Matt Watts, \"We ended up on Geffen, and it just seemed like no one there would assume responsibility for our band.\" On meeting people from the label, the group were told they would be treated like a new act, which left them disappointed.\n\nIn November, they finished writing and were aiming to record their next record in early 2004. Despite this earlier claim, the group said they had only finished writing in January 2004. They subsequently spent over half of the year writing new material and recording demos in Vasoli's basement. After the demos were unexpectedly leaked on the Internet, the band's fans thought it was their next album, but they were just \"rough sketches\" of what the band was going for. According to Watts, when the band played the demos for their label, the label responded by playing New Found Glory's \"Catalyst\" (2004). The label people said: \"'These demos aren't this CD, you guys should sound like this.' And that's not us.\"\n\nAccording to Watts, Geffen Records wanted the band to write a Simple Plan-esque record that had a pop sensibility to it that the label could release to the radio. The label pushed the band to write singles, however, the group \"fought to the death\" to write the record they wanted rather than \"Say It Like You Mean It,\" Part 2. According to Vasoli, most of the themes on \"Based on a True Story\" stem from having the songs but being frustrated by having to wait to get into the studio to record them. He thought the band had \"definitely got more comfortable\" with the songwriting process. Vasoli claimed the band expanded their musicality with \"Based on a True Story\".\n\n\"Inspired by the $\" came about when Vasoli attempted to write a song their record label would view as a hit. Fed up, he wrote \"Inspired by the $\", a song which satisfied his \"musical needs more than theirs.\" According to Vasoli \"Bedroom Talk\" was inspired by the knowledge he would lose his virginity to someone who would \"love me for longer than that night\". With this in mind, he wanted the song's lyrics to symbolize the \"physical and passionate sides of love\" while being honest. Vasoli viewed \"Photography\" as a typical love song that he wanted to tell \"the actual feeling of love\". Watts considered the song the band's \"November Rain\". Similar to \"Inspired by the $\", \"Ready\" was another song Vasoli felt went against what the label wanted him to do. They wanted the song to have a verse/chorus formula, which he refused to write.\n\nGeffen Records attempted to force the group into a direction which they did not want to go in and wanted Neal Avron to produce the album, but the band was determined to do their \"own thing\" according to Watts. Pre-production began on July 6 and lasted for two weeks while the band worked on 15 songs. During pre-production, Watts felt for the first time that the band was making a record as opposed to a bundle of songs that they simply liked. On August 1, it was announced that the band was one week into recording. On the same day, drummer Tom Gryskiewicz' drum parts were completed. On September 22, following eight weeks of work, recording was finished. Watts called the process \"great and really laid back\".\n\nTim O'Heir produced and engineered \"Inspired by the $\", \"Surprise, Surprise\", \"Photography\", \"Autography\", \"Artistic License\", \"Stay Where I Can See You\", \"The B-List\", \"Ready\", \"Cut! Print It\" and \"The World. These tracks were recorded at Mission Studios in Brooklyn, New York. Watts said O'Heir gave the songs an \"organic feel\" where \"it's not all computed and Pro Tools and stuff like that\". Additional engineering was done by Oliver Strauss. Additional recording took place at redruM Studios. David \"Garo\" Yellin arranged the strings on \"Photography\", and performed cello on the track. David Gold, Amy Kimbal and Taguchi Hiroka played violins on the track. Benjy King played the Hammond B3 organ on \"Photography\" and \"Cut! Print It\". Max Bemis of Say Anything contributed backing vocals on \"Ready\". Watts said it was \"an honor\" to have Bemis sing on the track as the band were big fans of Say Anything.\n\nVasoli said Geffen were not satisfied with how some songs sounded and wanted them to re-record the singles. The band then began working with Howard Benson. Benson produced a new version of \"The World\", and \"Bedroom Talk\", with recording taking place at Bay 7 Studios, Valley Village and Sparky Dark Studio in Calabasas, California. The tracks were recorded by Mike Plotnikoff, with additional engineering by Eric Miller. They were also edited using Pro-Tools by Paul DeCarli. Benson also played keyboards and provided programming on the tracks. Eric Rachel produced and engineered \"Making Love to the Camera\" recorded at Trax East in New York. Shawn Corrigan served as production assistant. Additional production was done by Vasoli. All the recordings were mixed by Chris Lord-Alge, with assistance from Dimtar Krnjaic, at Resonate Music in Burbank, California. Greg Calbi mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound in New York City.\n\nIn April 2005, the group went on tour with Armor for Sleep, Mae, and Suicide Pack, and debuted several new songs: \"Surprise, Surprise\", \"Bedroom Talk\", \"Ready\", \"Inspired by the $\", and \"Photography\". Around this time, the band filmed a music video for \"Bedroom Talk\". On April 11, the album's track listing was revealed. The following day, \"Bedroom Talk\" was released as a single. On April 17, \"Inspired by the $\" was made available for streaming via the group's PureVolume account, followed by three more songs on April 22. \"Based on a True Story\" was released by Drive-Thru and Geffen Records on May 10. The Japanese edition of the album included \"Nights and Weekends\" as a bonus track. It was later released in Canada on May 24 and in the UK on August 15. Fans who ordered the album within a week of pre-orders being posted received an autographed booklet. Everyone who pre-ordered was entered in a contest to win a Fender Telecaster guitar, and a lesson from a band member. Two runners-up received an assortment of Nike clothing.\n\nTo promote its release, the group did a few in-store performances, and appeared at the Y100 radio festival in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Between mid-June and mid-August, the group went on the 2005 edition of Warped Tour. On July 11, the music video for \"Bedroom Talk\", directed by Corey Petrick, was released. Shortly afterwards, Geffen Records de-prioritized the album and, as a result, despite the band's increasing popularity, provided very little promotion for the single. Vasoli said of the situation: \"It was like to go from such a perfect high point and have momentum going so well, then have it slowed down so much by the label\". In mid-September, the band toured the UK with the Early November and Anberlin. From late-September to late-November, the group went on the 2005 edition of the Nintendo Fusion Tour. On November 3, \"Alternative Press\" reported that the band had left Geffen Records and was in discussion with other labels. \"AbsolutePunk\" reported that record labels were having meetings with the band while it was on the Nintendo Fusion Tour.\n\nThe band's departure from Geffen Records was made official in mid-December. According to Watts, the band talked with Geffen president Jordan Schur who understood their concerns and the reasons they wanted to leave the label. \"He finally gave us the option to leave, and we did that.\" Vasoli added that it was \"probably like an hour[-long phone] call with them really hashing it out\". Vasoli also said that to be released from their contract with Geffen, the band \"forfeited rights to the recordings of \"Based On A True Story\". We might run into trouble if we ever try to re-record that stuff\". In January 2006, the band co-headlined a UK tour with MxPx, with support from the Matches and I Am the Avalanche. In February and March, the group headlined the Screaming Is for Babies tour, with support from Copeland, Gatsbys American Dream, and Cartel. In October 2008, the album was made available for streaming through the band's Myspace profile, and released on vinyl in 2013.\n\nNine days after its release, \"Based on a True Story\" had sold 41,686 copies, charting at number 18 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. The album received mixed to positive reviews from critics. \"AbsolutePunk\" founder Jason Tate wrote that the band's sound was \"still catchy, the music still bouncy\" with \"plenty of guaranteed sing along choruses\". He considered it an unexpected release: \"I figured it would be good, I never expected it to be great. I'm glad I was wrong.\" He concluded by calling it \"uplifting and incredibly fun to listen to\". AllMusic reviewer Johnny Loftus drew a comparison between the band's earlier release \"The Make Yourself at Home EP\" (2003) and \"Based on a True Story\". He said the album incorporated acoustic instrumentation, placing focus on Vasoli's \"edge-of-tears\" vocals, as well as \"favoring busy breaks that distract from actual rocking\". With this album, Loftus noted that the band \"matured into a more grandiose version\" of New Found Glory.\n\nKaj Roth of \"Melodic\" magazine mentioned how the group mixed emo and pop punk on \"Based on a True Story\", comparing it to \"having Armor For Sleep and Autopilot Off making a record together\". Roth thought the album contained \"some truly great stuff, a few ok songs and unfortunately 2-3 fillers,\" suggesting the band should have made an EP instead of an album. Punknews.org reviewer Meg Reinecker noted how the group had used the preceding three years to mature \"both vocally and instrumentally\". David Wild of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that the band \"made their sad songs much less cheesy\" on the album. He said the \"fresh-faced punk ballads\" were \"way more palatable\" compared to \"most emo bloodletting, but it's still too depressive and not as songful as it ought to be\". Wild concluded by noting the band knows \"how to make sweetly wordy pop out of over-the-top romantic naivete\".\n\nAll songs written by the Starting Line.\n\nPersonnel per booklet.\nThe Starting Line\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nProduction\nCitations\nSources\n\n"}

It is an account of the events leading to the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. An uncharacteristically human caricature of Richard Nixon serves as protagonist and narrator for the primary continuity.\n\nThe novel satirizes the Cold War politics of Joseph McCarthy by portraying \"The Phantom\" as the embodiment of global Communism and everything that threatens the American way of life—a vague, terrifying, and omnipresent enemy. The ugly side of the American psyche this draws out is characterized by an incarnation of Uncle Sam who unleashes a torrent of interminable verbosity in a folksy, foul-mouthed style whenever he appears. The \"New York Times\" and \"Time Magazine\" figure centrally as symbols of institutional failure not only to question whether the truth was a victim in this hyperpoliticized trial but also whether the official narrative was in fact a bunch of political lies.\n\nCoover first experienced difficulty finding a publisher, and then when he found a publisher, getting it to actually publish the novel, due to legal concerns over the unflattering depiction of Richard Nixon, Pat Nixon, Roy Cohn, and others. Then having published the novel, once it became a bestseller, Viking immediately abandoned all support, and pulled in copies, without explanation. Coover's editor, Richard Seaver, speculated to Coover that Viking management believed success would attract lawsuits.\n\nDespite these difficulties, this novel has received a large amount of critical attention. It has been called \"perhaps the most complete replenishment of the language since Whitman and (in a different way) Mark Twain ... no writer since Melville has dived so deeply and fearlessly into this collective American dream as Coover has in this novel\".\n\n"}

He set up in private medical practice in Soho, London, and then decided to specialise in psychiatry, being appointed to Springfield asylum, the first Surrey County Asylum. Diamond later moved to Brookwood Hospital, also in Surrey. Diamond was one of the founders of the Photographic Society, was later its Secretary and also became the editor of the Photographic Journal.\n\nDiamond was fascinated by the possible use of photography in the treatment of mental disorders; some of his many calotypes depicting the expressions of people suffering from mental disorders are particularly moving. These were used not only for record purposes, but also, he claimed in the treatment of patients - although there was little evidence of success.\n\nPerhaps it is for his attempts to popularize photography and to lessen its mystique that Diamond is best remembered. He wrote many articles and was a popular lecturer, and he also sought to encourage younger photographers. Among the latter was Henry Peach Robinson, who was later to refer to Diamond as a \"father figure\" of photography.\n\nRecognition for his encouragement and for his willingness to share his knowledge came in 1855, in the form of a testimonial amounting to £300 for services to photography; among those who subscribed were such people as Delamotte, Fenton and George Shadbolt. In 1867, the Photographic Society awarded its Medal in recognition of \"his long and successful labours as one of the principal pioneers of the photographic art and of his continuing endeavours for its advancement.\" The following year, at his own initiative, he relinquished any further salary as Secretary of the Society, and became its Hon. Secretary.\n\n"}
{"id": "2008318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008318", "title": "École nationale de l'aviation civile", "text": "École nationale de l'aviation civile\n\nThe École nationale de l'aviation civile (ENAC) (French Civil Aviation University) is one of the 205 colleges (as of September 2018) accredited to deliver engineering degrees in France.\n\nENAC is designated a \"Grande école\" by the \"Conférence des Grandes Écoles (CGE)\", a non-profit organisation which certifies and monitors these \"Grandes écoles\" (colleges of engineering in France). ENAC was founded on 28 August 1949 to provide initial and continuing education in the field of civil aviation. This university is a \"établissement public à caractère scientifique, culturel et professionnel\" (French public scientific, cultural or professional establishment) and operates under the oversight of the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development, Transport and Housing. It is also member of the following apart from \"Conférence des Grandes Écoles\", University of Toulouse, Aerospace Valley and is one of the five founders of France AEROTECH.\n\nENAC offers 30 engineering and technical programs in civil aviation/aeronautics. Some of the most notable ones include aerospace engineering, aircraft technicians, commercial airline pilots licenses, air traffic control, and flight instructors. The university also offers 3 masters of science programs and 12 Advanced masters degrees for students with relevant experience.\n\nIn 1945, immediately after WWII, the French air transport industry witnessed rapid growth. To ensure safety and compliance to regulations, demand for qualified staff was high and there was a need to harmonise communications between various sectors of the aviation industry. ENAC was founded to address this issue. Among the founders was Max Hymans, the secretary general of civil and commercial aviation at the time, who played a prominent role in ENAC's creation.\n\nIn the years following the Western Front, there was a distinct lack of unity within the civil aviation industry due to the recruitment of people with various backgrounds; this was a common situation in times of emergency when personnel were recruited hastily and in high quantities. To standardize backgrounds, many centers were created to train aeronautic personnel. Airfield commanders were trained in Orly while technical staff for air navigation were trained in Le Bourget. Wireless operators and radio technicians were also trained in Orly, although under the Department of Telecommunications and Signaling, which was not connected directly to the world of aviation. Technical managers were mostly trained in engineering schools, including \"Arts et Métiers\" and the National School of Meteorology (\"École nationale de la météorologie\"). Designers were trained by the \"École spéciale des travaux aéronautiques\" while aircrew were trained by other public or private institutions. ENAC's mission was to unify the training of all aviation personnel.\n\nThrough Decree No. 49-970 (7 June 1948), the rules of the French public administration were laid down. A complete overhaul of the regulations applying to civil aviation officials was made, affecting the technical staff in particular. Several new bodies of civil servants were established: air traffic engineers, air navigation operation engineers, aerial telecommunication civil engineers, air traffic controllers, telecommunication controllers and air navigation agents. The creation of these new bodies was immediately followed by a ministerial decision on 12 August 1948 that paved the way for the first recruitment by competitive examination. The examinations themselves were organized in October 1948. Independently of these events, on 14 April 1948, the International Civil Aviation Organization established prerequisite conditions for air crew licensing, notably including a minimum number of flight hours for each category of aircraft pilots.\n\nBefore adopting the name ENAC, the school was called a \"service of education and internships\" (\"service des écoles et des stages)\" and was provided by the General secretariat for civil and commercial aviation. That contrasted with that the longstanding tradition of French civil service personnel being trained in higher education institutions called \"Grande écoles.\" Jules Moch, the Minister of Works, Transport and Tourism at the time, proposed the name: \"\"École nationale de l'aviation marchande\"\", a name which was ultimately not chosen.\n\nENAC was created on 28 August 1949 (Decree 49-1205) in Paris at the initiative of Max Hymans, Secretary General of Civil Aviation, and Jules Moch to train all professionals of civil aeronautics and harmonize all air transport stakeholders, aircrew or not, commercial or technical, including civil services of civil aviation. The university is located at Orly, south of Paris (ENAC's buildings at Orly served as an examination center until the early 1990s). René Lemaire considers ENAC as \"a university of aviation safety\". This priority given to aviation safety is somehow consubstantial with ENAC, being the first reason for the training of future technicians and future airmen in a single university.\nAs noted in a report of the \"Inspection générale de l'aviation civile\", \"It was in the minds of the creators of the university, to develop between the aircrew and the ground staff a community of ideas, reciprocal knowledge, and esteem, that are essential for the teamwork required by air transport.\" However, it is doubtful that the \"community of ideas\" the author of the report wishes could be only expressed by the coexistence of different courses in the same university. Other factors work in opposite directions, including the very significant disparity of durations of the training cycles. Thus, air navigation civil engineers of the branch \"telecommunications\" stay 30 months in the university; students of the course \"operations\" are trained in 27 months ; air navigation engineers in two years; and finally, air traffic controllers in nine months. To realize fully the chemistry that, in the minds of its founders, must proceed in the creation of ENAC, it is necessary that other conditions are met. The main one is the consistency of the education provided to the students in different cycles. This need is reflected by the interpenetration of theoretical and practical training, \"air\" and \"ground\". The brand's most visible of such interpenetration is the development, whenever possible, of the teaching called \"inter-specialization\", that means, integrated programs of distinct cycles. These teachings, which have different promotions for a single design cost, results in significant savings, as well noticed by Rene Lemaire.\nOn 13 October 1959, the first major partner of the university was officially recognised. This allowed the recruitment of novice pilots with no previous flight experience. Previously, in 1958, the university only held training sessions on a purely experimental basis, and was responsible for the Airline Transport Pilot License theory. Regarding practical training in flight, it is performed at the SEFA center of Saint-Yan, created in 1949, until the commercial pilot licence, and at the Air France school for the advanced training. ENAC, in addition to its official duty related to the preparation of the Airline Transport Pilot Licence theory, has some tasks of theoretical training for pilots of various airlines. The question of the financial aspect of the training for airline pilots in private airlines arises. This training, whose cost is not paid by the French state, is too expensive for airlines and students, due to the flight training part in particular. Private airlines decided to pay the cost, which makes possible the free education for student pilots.\nMeanwhile, to enable its students to acquire a thorough knowledge of the environment in which the air transport takes place, ENAC seeks to develop cooperation with the \"École nationale de la météorologie\". A report dated 29 May 1950 invokes the obvious implications of meteorology in the air traffic and promotes the training of this topic for air traffic controllers. Also, many and close links traditionally exits between civil aviation and Air Force. After World War II, when civil aviation is developing, soldiers can help its expansion. A lot of pilots, but also radios, navigators and mechanics came from the army to airlines. ENAC seeks to be part of this movement, and help the conversion of military aircrew. It is in this spirit that was signed on 9 June 1951 a memorandum specifying its duties in the training of military pilots for civil aviation. The university is the general contractor of the operations and provides theoretical training. The \"Service de l'aviation légère et sportive\" (SALS), under the decree of 31 March 1951, is providing for free the flight training for airline pilots candidates coming from the army.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1959, the number of courses held increased from 6 to 64 and the number of students from 49 to 800. The causes of rapid enrollment growth are multiple. There is no doubt that ENAC has benefited from the spectacular development of air transport in the postwar years. But it would not have taken such an advantage if its teachings were not performant. Finally, one can not ignore the presence of a significant contingent of students from either foreign countries or – in even larger numbers – which territories would gain independence in the near future. In the early 1960s, the university is beginning to welcome its first students and trainees from foreign civil aviation authorities. Along with enrollment growth, new courses are created regularly. This creation is often a direct result of an administrative decision, as is case when a new rating is introduced. Thus, in 1956 was created the navigation instructor rating, with the opening of the corresponding training. Sometimes a course is simply set to meet a need. The same year 1956, for example, a speaking techniques course for instructors is introduced. Still in 1956, appears the first engineering students called \"civilians\", that is to say, not officials. The openings of new training graduate courses, of course, is much less frequent than those of new continuous training, which occurs fairly regularly. In 1958, the airline pilots theoretical training course started.\n\nLife at ENAC Orly is then punctuated by the yearly trip for all the students, undoubtedly one of the highlights of the studies. It has its share of unexpected, but its rites, as the inevitable reception in full uniform of the university officials and the students by local authorities, on arrival at a new location.\n\nThe university underwent significant changes during the period 1960–1975. In 1968 the university moved to Toulouse where the main campus is still located today. In 1970, the status of the university was changed, from an external department of the DGAC to a public Administration institution.\n\nAt the time of its creation, the \"École nationale de l'aviation civile\" was located on the outskirts of the runways of Paris-Orly Airport. This location near the largest airport in France offered many advantages, such as easy access to airplanes for navigation flights, promotional trips and other activities. In addition, leaders from nearby airlines, aircraft manufacturers and other aviation-related businesses could come to the university for lectures and conferences.\nHowever, the rapid growth of traffic at Paris-Orly – the platform of Roissy Charles de Gaulle did not exist yet – created in new challenges. For instance, requirements for the aircraft used by ENAC to be used in air traffic were growing more stringent. Consequently, Aéroports de Paris became increasingly reluctant to renew the lease for the lands on which the university was located. From the early 1960s, there the future of the facilities at Orly looked uncertain.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, people began to consider the possibility of moving the ENAC to a new location. Potential locations all involved cities close to Parisian airports. Thus, between 1954 and 1957, Thiais, Rungis, Issy-les-Moulineaux, Les Mureaux and even Le Bourget were all considered. That's not counting with the requirements of decentralization. Even before the famous book by Jean-François Gravier, \"Paris et le désert français\" (Paris and the French desert), decentralization was considered a key priority. Plans to keep the ENAC close to Paris looked increasingly doubtful, and more peripheral locations began to be considered. The potential locations were all part of a 150 km radius around the capital, among others Melun, Pontoise, Coulommiers, Étampes, Reims, Évreux, Chartres and Orléans. Meanwhile, a report published on 20 May 1959 listed the disadvantages of a location too distant from Paris, such as difficulties of transporting personnel, the possible extension of duration of the courses, and increased operating costs.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that René Lemaire proposed moving the school to Toulouse in a report published on 14 June 1960. The city's aeronautical infrastructure and long history as a university town made it an attractive location: the (University of Toulouse, created in 1229, isone of the oldest universities in France, ENSICA had settled in Toulouse since 1961 and the SUPAERO was going to move from Paris to the city). On 15 June 1961, the university's transfer to Toulouse was officially approved by the Prime Minister Michel Debré. It was confirmed by his successor Georges Pompidou in a letter dated 23 July 1963.\n\nConstruction of new buildings on the Rangueil campus began in April 1966. and was completed on 19 August 1968. The academic year started on 16 September 1968. An intake of five hundred students was expected, including 325 who were beginning their training. The new students consisted of 15 air navigation engineering students drawn largely from École Polytechnique, 70 engineering students in air navigation from \"classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles\", 60 airline pilot students, 100 air traffic controllers students, 40 electronics students, 20 commercial pilot students and 20 flight dispatcher students.\n\nThe \"Commission permanente\" began to grapple with the issue of the university's ambiguous legal status. This had been a problem since the university's founding, and had resurfaced on numerous occasions, as shown by various inspection reports on the institution management. The ENAC was closely monitored by its supervisory authority. Inspection reports were published at a rapid pace, at a rate of one every two years or more, and frequently leveled harsh criticisms at the ENAC. In contrast with the preceding years, reports published from mid-1950s onwards began to call into question the university's very existence. For instance, the confidential Brancourt Controller of 12 March 1952, asserted that the university had \"a lack of doctrine\", that \"there is a certain tension with the training center of Air France\", and even that the \"ENAC is a mistake\".\n\nThese difficulties were largely due to the mismatch between the status of ENAC and the nature of its business, which required it to provide courses for students and trainees who were not all officials from the supervisory authority, and to use teaching staff from different origins. The cumbersome process for allocating university budget also created challenges after other types of income, such as non-public resources, were reduced. This happened more in the years 1958–1964. In 1962, the management of ENAC considered raising tuition fees, courses prices and fees for customers outside from the Directorate General for Civil Aviation. However, the status of the institution meant this involved a complex approval process that ultimately lead to paralysis. For this reason, the separate status of \"public administrative institution\" appeared more appropriate. The final decision was taken in the form of Decree No. 70-347 on 13 April 1970, with application from 1 January 1971. This made the school a public administrative institution. The ENAC was given a board of directors, with René Lemaire as its first president.\n\nFrom 1975 a phenomenon is growing. It consists of a slow but inexorable increase of the proportion of engineering students called \"civilians\" in opposition to the \"officials\" (civil servants) engineering students. ENAC is becoming a major player in the training for aerospace industry (civilian personnel), while its primary purpose was only the training of officials for \"direction générale de l'aviation civile\". It is true that the existence of students for the private sector is not new at the university : it was in 1956 that are off the first of them. At the end of the 1950s, however, this recruitment is subsidiary and affects only a minority of students. It is primarily intended to offset the disadvantage which consists of the highly fluctuating number of students to serve in the Administration and to prevent the size of successive promotions with a too great disparity. However, this second source tends to become more and more important, to finally become dominant. This results in an overhaul of the teachings. ENAC engineering education, particularly that of the specialty called \"facilities\" – it focuses on electronics – convince the industrial sectors of electronics and information technology. Without having particularly desired, the university is gradually invested with the role of National \"Grande Ecole\" of Engineers.\n\nIndustry oriented university, research appeared in 1984, following the law on Higher education which provides that \"engineering education [...] has a research activity, basic or applied, \" and is organized around four areas: electronics, automation, computer and air transport economy. The university then feels interest for future engineers to learn research methods: while the method of deductive reasoning, for a long time favored by teachers in the \"classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles\" and \"grandes écoles\", shows its limitations, the method of inductive reasoning, characteristic of research, appears increasingly better adapted to highly scalable nature of functions performed by nowadays engineers. The most recent manifestation of the growing interest in research at ENAC is the creation of the air transport economics laboratory, which designation reflects the desire to study, in addition to air transport itself, certain related activities such as air navigation.\n\nThe mid-1980s saw the emergence of \"mastères spécialisés\" programs. They are born for most of them from an industrial demand, including the \"groupement des industries françaises aéronautiques et spatiales\", keen to support the export contracts by training. Indeed, while filling the needs of many French students or professionals, they can train in a relatively short period some foreign executives. The same period saw the diversification of continuing education at the university. The continuing education courses are organized in five main areas: air traffic systems, electronics, computer, aeronautics and languages/humanities.\n\nThe international dimension of the university grew significantly during the 1990s. However, its development faced a considerable obstacle in the form of the design and implementation of new training requirements for air traffic controllers. This hampered the university's efforts to develop ties abroad. The ENAC began to take on a more European character by participating in European projects such as EATCHIP (European Air Traffic control Harmonization and Integration Program), and by offering mobility programs for students through the Erasmus or Socrates. Under these programs, the university began to welcome a growing number of foreign students and forged close ties with foreign universities such as the Berlin Institute of Technology and the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany, and the University of Tampere in Finland. It was also during this period that ENAC created the \"groupement des écoles d'aéronautique\" (GEA France, in English French aeronautical universities network) with the ISAE and ENSMA. The three \"grandes écoles\" of this network, in partnership with the DGAC and French companies like (EADS, Airbus, Thales, Eurocopter, Safran), created in 2007 the \"Institut sino-européen d'ingénierie de l'aviation\" (Chinese European aviation engineering Institute) of Tianjin which provides Masters and \"Mastères Spécialisés\" courses for Chinese students. Since 1990, new missions have emerged. Thus, ENAC negotiates new contracts for studies and research abroad. During the 2000s, courses entirely taught in English and activities focused on air navigation were developed. In 2009, the university and its alumni association organized the first edition of the aeronautical literary festival in Toulouse. In December 2010, ENAC becomes an ICAO center for training in aviation security.\n\nMeanwhile, the university also established new teaching facilities : the air traffic control simulator \"CAUTRA\", the aerodrome control simulator \"AERSIM\", an Airbus A320 flight management system simulator, a static model of the CFM 56-5B engine that equips the A321 and a telecom networks laboratory.\n\nSince 1 January 2011 when the ENAC merged with the SEFA, the university is the biggest aviation university in Europe.\n\nIn 2013, ENAC launches with the DGAC, the \"Groupement d'intérêt économique\" DSNA Services which became France Aviation Civile Services in 2019, an expertise office intended to sell the French know-how in terms of regulation, air transport security and air navigation.\n\nThe current director of the university is Olivier Chansou, succeeding Marc Houalla who was SEFA director from 2006 till 1 January 2011. It is the eighth person to be director since the establishment of the university. He was elected the 27th of Novembre 2017. The various directors since inception are given in the following table.\n\nThe university is managed by an elected president. The president administers through three councils; the Training and research council, Flight training council and an International relations and development council.\n\nIn 2011, the university had a budget of 126 Million Euros, an increase of 61% compared to 2010. This came as a result of its merger with SEFA and includes an EU subsidy of 102 Million Euros.\n\nAfter several months of consideration, a corporate foundation was established in September 2011. It aims to guide the training and research council on reforming training \"Ingénieur ENAC\" (ENAC engineer) and corporate partnerships.\nIt consists of technical and human resources managers from aerospace companies such as Air France, Airbus, Aéroport de Paris, Rockwell Collins, Thalès and \"Aéroconseil\".\n\nENAC operates over eight locations with the main campus located at Rangueil, 6 km distant from Toulouse:\n\n\nThe university can provide accommodation. It also has a canteen, cafeteria, library, computer rooms, sports halls including a fitness room, a sports field, a rugby field, five tennis courts, a beach volleyball and a golf driving range.\n\nENAC has a fleet of 130 aircraft of different types:\n\nThe Toulouse campus has a number of fixed and full flight simulators (Robin DR400, Socata TB-20, Airbus A320 and Airbus A340). The air navigation department has control tower simulators (at 120 or 360 degrees), a ground-controlled approach and an area control center simulator.\n\nENAC has four Bachelor's degree courses to train airline pilots and civil aviation Technicians.\n\nENAC provide theoretical training for airline pilot students (EPL) in eight months in its campus of Toulouse, and the practical training of 16 months, is given in the other campuses of the university in Montpellier, Carcassonne, Saint-Yan or Muret. Since 1992, graduates of this training are represented by an alumni association called AGEPAC. In parallel, the university propose a preparation for the Airline Transport Pilot Licence theory (CPATPL) distinguished by its vocation, allow high school students from low income families to become airline pilot, and its level of recruitment (\"Baccalauréat\"). After graduation, students can prepare the Commercial pilot licence or going to the course \"technicien aéronautique d'exploitation\" (TAE, in English aeronautical operations technician), training also accessible from two other recruitment. With a similar name but preparing for a different job, the curriculum \"technicien supérieur de l'aviation\" (TSA, in English higher aviation Technician) allows the integration of the \"techniciens supérieurs des études et de l'exploitation de l'aviation civile\" (TSEEAC, in English higher civil aviation operations Technicians) civil servant department or the one of the \"techniciens supérieurs de l'aviation civils\" (TSA civils, in English civilian higher aviation Technician).\n\nIn addition, the university has seven Master's degree programs to train people for both aerospace industry and Directorate General for Civil Aviation.\n\nGoing exclusively to the Directorate General for Civil Aviation, the courses of \"ingénieur du contrôle de la navigation aérienne\" (ICNA, in English Air traffic controller) and \"ingénieur électronicien des systèmes de la sécurité aérienne\" (IESSA, in English Air Traffic Safety Electronics Personnel) are done by the university. the \"Ingénieur ENAC\" (IENAC) course trains aerospace engineer in three sectors : electronics and aeronautical telecommunications (L), computer systems and air traffic (S) and aeronautical engineering (T). A small part (10%), are civil servant engineering students. They become \"ingénieurs des études et de l'exploitation de l'aviation civile\" (civil aviation operations engineer) after graduation. Since 1949, ENAC is a specialization university for \"École Polytechnique\" graduates.\nThus, since 16 April 2002 and the merger of the \"corps des ingénieurs de l'aviation civile (IAC)\" (civil aviation engineer department) and thus of \" géographie et de la météorologie\" (geography and meteorology) into the Corps of Bridges and Roads, the training of managers of the Directorate General for Civil Aviation has changed. The Corps of Bridges and Roads are trained at the \"École des Ponts ParisTech\" and part of the course (about 300 hours) is organized in cooperation with ENAC for students who wants to join the DGAC. Furthermore, the university has created in 2007 a Master's degree in International Air Transport Opération Management (IATOM), in 2011 the course Master's degree in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) supported by the European Commission and in 2012 the training Master's degree in Air Traffic Management (ATM) in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Master's degree in Human–computer interaction (IHM) is realized in cooperation with the Paul Sabatier University.\n\nFinally, the École nationale de l'aviation civile provides seven \"Mastères Spécialisés\" courses in the fields : airport management (MA), air transport management (MTA) (in partnership with Toulouse Business School), Communication, navigation and surveillance and satellite applications for aviation (CNSSAA), aviation safety aircraft airworthiness (ASAA) (in partnership with the \"Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace\" and the \"École de l'Air\"), air-ground collaborative systems engineering (AGCSE), aviation and air traffic management (AATM) and aerospace project management (APM) (in partnership with the \"Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace\" and the \"École de l'Air\").\n\nThe alumni of the three Master programs, the \"Ingénieur ENAC\" course, as well as those of the Corps of Bridges and Roads and those of the \"Mastères Spécialisés\" courses was represented by an association, INGENAC, created in 1988, member of the \"Ingénieurs et Scientifiques de France\" (French scientific and engineer council) and located in Toulouse. On 16 March 2012, INGENAC decided to represent all the alumni of the university and changes its name to « ENAC Alumni ».\n\nEach course of the university has its own recruitment process, most of the time by a competitive examination.\n\nBy hosting each year more than 7,500 students who participate to more than 600 courses annually organized by the university, with a turnover of 15 million euros, ENAC is now the largest organization in Europe for aeronautical continuing education. The continuing education of ENAC has been developed in areas which ENAC is well recognized : air traffic, electronics, computer science, aeronautical engineering, aircraft control (instructor), ... These activities are for French and foreign businesses and for personnel of the \"direction générale de l'aviation civile\".\n\nStudents of the IENAC course can study at the \"Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace\" and at the \"École nationale supérieure de mécanique et d'aérotechnique\" as part of the \"groupement des écoles d'aéronautique\", and also at the INPT and at Audencia. Moreover, as part of France AEROTECH, an exchange of third year engineering students is under consideration with \"Centrale Lyon\", \"Centrale Nantes\", ENSEIRB-MATMECA and \"Arts et Métiers ParisTech\".\n\nAbroad, students have access to the Erasmus Programme and to Pegasus. In the aerospace engineer course (\"Ingénieur ENAC\" course), the university welcomes 8% of foreign students in 2011. Considering all the courses, this rate is 46% in 2010.\n\nThe university has also several bilateral agreements, in particular with : Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Florida Institute of Technology, University of California, University of Washington, \"École africaine de la météorologie et de l'aviation civile\". It also trains the staff of the \"Agence pour la sécurité de la navigation aérienne en Afrique et à Madagascar\".\n\nAlso, ENAC is a founder of the \"Institut sino-européen d'ingénierie de l'aviation\" of Tianjin. On this city, the university provides four \"Mastères Spécialisés\" courses at the Civil Aviation University of China only for Chinese students : airport management, aviation safety management – airworthiness, aviation safety management – flight opérations (in partnership with the \"Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace\") and aviation safety management – aeronautical maintenance (in partnership with the \"Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace\").\n\nFinally, in December 2011, the university has signed a partnership with the \"École des Ponts ParisTech\" and the \"Académie internationale Mohammed VI de l'aviation civile\" to launch, in March 2012 at Casablanca, an Executive MBA in aviation management for aerospace middle management.\n\nResearch is a growing business at ENAC. Industry oriented university, it appears in 1984, following the law on higher education which provides that « \"la formation des ingénieurs...comporte une activité de recherche, fondamentale ou appliquée\" » (engineer training...contains a research activity, pure or applied). It was originally organized around four areas : electronics, automation, computer and air transport economy. Mid-2009, the research teams was in the following laboratories : \"automatique – recherche opérationnelle (LARA)\" (automation – operational research), \"économie – d'économétrie de l'aérien (LÉÉA)\" (economy – air econometrics), \"étude – d'optimisation des architectures des réseaux de télécommunications (LÉOPART)\" (study – optimization of telecommunications networks architectures), \"électromagnétisme pour les télécommunications aéronautiques (LÉTA)\" (electromagnetism for aeronautical telecommunications), \"informatique interactive (LII)\" (interactive computer), \"mathématiques appliquées (LMA)\" (applied mathematics), \"optimisation du trafic aérien (LOTA)\" (air traffic optimization) and \"traitement du signal pour les télécommunications aéronautiques (LTST)\" (signal processing for the aeronautical telecommunications).\n\nENAC also has, since 2005, a team specializing in UAVs that maintains and develops \"Paparazzi\", a free system for automatic control of UAVs, unmanned aerial vehicle laboratory. The infrastructure includes also a planetarium and an air traffic control simulator. ENAC is a founding member of the European academy for aviation safety (EAFAS), network of the key training organizations in the field of air safety.\nDuring the Paris Air Show of 2005, the university announces a partnership with ONERA in the fields of air traffic management, air safety, satellite navigation, sustainable development and air transport economy.\n\nEnd of 2011, the university has established a new research organization that are six transverse programs : UAVs and air traffic management, airports, aircraft and air operations, human-computer interaction, air/ground communications and sustainable development, everything is now based on four laboratories : applied mathematics – optimization – optimal control – control engineering operations research (MAIAA), signal processing – satellite positioning system – electromagnetism – networks (TELECOM), architecture – modeling – engineering of interactive systems (LII) and economics – air transport econometrics (LEEA).\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2008322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008322", "title": "Vehicle-to-grid", "text": "Vehicle-to-grid\n\nVehicle-to-grid (V2G) describes a system in which plug-in electric vehicles, such as battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in hybrids (PHEV) or hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV), communicate with the power grid to sell demand response services by either returning electricity to the grid or by throttling their charging rate. V2G storage capabilities can enable EVs to store and discharge electricity generated from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, with output that fluctuates depending on weather and time of day.\n\nV2G can be used with \"gridable\" vehicles, that is, plug-in electric vehicles (BEV and PHEV), with grid capacity. Since at any given time 95 percent of cars are parked, the batteries in electric vehicles could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the electric distribution network and back. A 2015 report on potential earnings associated with V2G found that with proper regulatory support, vehicle owners could earn $454, $394, and $318 per year depending on whether their average daily drive was , respectively.\n\nBatteries have a finite number of charging cycles, as well as a shelf-life, therefore using vehicles as grid storage can impact battery longevity. Studies that cycle batteries two or more times per day have shown large decreases in capacity and greatly shortened life. However, battery capacity is a complex function of factors such as battery chemistry, charging and discharging rate, temperature, state of charge and age. Most studies with slower discharge rates show only a few percent of additional degradation while one study has suggested that using vehicles for grid storage could improve longevity.\n\nSometimes the modulation of charging of a fleet of electric vehicles by an aggregator to offer services to the grid but without actual electrical flow from the vehicles to the grid is called unidirectional V2G, as opposed to the bidirectional V2G that is generally discussed in this article.\n\nThe concept allows V2G vehicles to provide power to help balance loads by \"valley filling\" (charging at night when demand is low) and \"peak shaving\" (sending power back to the grid when demand is high, see duck curve). \nPeak load leveling can enable new ways for utilities to provide regulation services (keeping voltage and frequency stable) and provide spinning reserves (meet sudden demands for power). \nThese services coupled with \"smart-meters\" would allow V2G vehicles to give power back to the grid and in return, receive monetary benefits based on how much power given back to the grid. In its current development, it has been proposed that such use of electric vehicles could buffer renewable power sources such as wind power for example, by storing excess energy produced during windy periods and providing it back to the grid during high load periods, thus effectively stabilizing the intermittency of wind power. Some see this application of vehicle-to-grid technology as an approach to help renewable energy become a base load electricity technology.\n\nIt has been proposed that public utilities would not have to build as many natural gas or coal-fired power plants to meet peak demand or as an insurance policy against power outages. \nSince demand can be measured locally by a simple frequency measurement, dynamic load leveling can be provided as needed.\nCarbitrage, a portmanteau of 'car' and 'arbitrage', is sometimes used to refer to the minimum price of electricity at which a vehicle would discharge its battery.\n\nModern electric vehicles can generally store in their batteries more than an average home's daily energy demand. \nEven without a PHEV's gas generation capabilities such a vehicle could be used for emergency power for several days (for example, lighting, home appliances, etc.). \nThis would be an example of Vehicle-to-home transmission (V2H). \nAs such they may be seen as a complementary technology for intermittent renewable power resources such as wind or solar electric. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCV) with tanks containing up to 5.6 kg of hydrogen can deliver more than 90 kWh of electricity.\n\nMany of the grid-scale benefits of V2G can be accomplished with unidirectional V2G, also known as V1G or \"smart charging\". The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) defines V1G as \"unidirectional managed charging services\" and defines the four levels of Vehicle-Grid Interface (VGI), which encompasses all of the ways that EVs can provide grid services, as follows:\n\n\nV1G involves varying the time or rate at which an electric vehicle is charged in order to provide ancillary services to the grid, while V2G also includes reverse power flow. V1G includes applications such as timing vehicles to charge in the middle of the day to absorb excess solar generation, or varying the charge rate of electric vehicles to provide frequency response services or load balancing services.\n\nV1G may be the best option to begin integrating EVs as controllable loads onto the electric grid due to technical issues that currently exist with regards to the feasibility of V2G. V2G requires specialized hardware (especially bi-directional inverters), has fairly high losses and limited round-trip efficiency, and may contribute to EV battery degradation due to increased energy throughput. Additionally, revenues from V2G in an SCE pilot project were lower than the costs of administering the project, indicating that V2G still has a ways to go before being economically feasible.\n\nVehicle-to-home (V2H) or vehicle-to-building (V2B) or vehicle-to-everything (V2X) do not typically directly affect grid performance but creates a balance within the local environment. The electric vehicle is used as a residential back-up power supply during periods of power outage or for increasing self-consumption of energy produced on-site (demand charge avoidance).\n\nUnlike more mature V1G solutions, V2X has not yet reached market deployment, apart from Japan where commercial V2H solutions have been available since 2012 as back-up a solution in case of electricity black-out.\n\nWith V2G, the electric vehicles could be equipped to actually provide electricity to the grid. The utility or transmission system operator may be willing to purchase energy from customers during periods of peak demand, or to use the EV battery capacity for providing ancillary services, such as balancing and frequency control, including primary frequency regulation and secondary reserve. Thus, V2G is in most applications deemed to have higher potential commercial value than V2B or V2H.\n\nMost modern battery electric vehicles use lithium-ion cells that can achieve round-trip efficiency greater than 90%. \nThe efficiency of the battery depends on factors like charge rate, charge state, battery state of health, and temperature.\nThe majority of losses, however, are in system components other than the battery. \nPower electronics, such as inverters, typically dominate overall losses.\nA study found overall round-trip efficiency for V2G system in the range of 53% to 62%'. \nAnother study reports an efficiency of about 70%.\nThe overall efficiency however depends on several factors and can vary widely.\n\nA study conducted in 2012 by the Idaho National Laboratory\nrevealed the following estimations and future plans for V2G in various countries. It is important to note that this is difficult to quantify because the technology is still in its nascent stage, and is therefore difficult to reliably predict adoption of the technology around the world. The following list is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to give an idea of the scope of development and progress in these areas around the world.\n\nPJM Interconnection has envisioned using US Postal Service trucks, school buses and garbage trucks that remain unused overnight for grid connection.\nThis could generate millions of dollars because these companies aid in storing and stabilizing some of the national grid's energy. The United States was projected to have one million electric vehicles on the road between 2015 and 2019. Studies indicate that 160 new power plants will need to be built by 2020 to compensate for electric vehicles if integration with the grid does not move forward.\n\nIn North America, at least two major school-bus manufacturers—Blue Bird and Lion—are working on proving the benefits of electrification and vehicle-to-grid technology. As school buses in the U.S. currently use $3.2B of diesel a year, their electrification can help stabilize the electrical grid, lessen the need for new power plants, and reduce kids’ exposure to cancer-causing exhaust.\n\nIn 2017, at the University of California San Diego, V2G technology provider Nuvve launched a pilot program called INVENT, funded by the California Energy Commission, with the installation of 50 V2G bi-directional charging stations around the campus. The program expanded in 2018 to include a fleet of EVs for its free nighttime shuttle service, Triton Rides.\n\nIn 2018, Nissan launched a pilot program under the Nissan Energy Share initiative in partnership with vehicle-to-grid systems company Fermata Energy seeking to use bi-directional charging technology to partially power Nissan North America's headquarters in Franklin, Tn. In 2020 Fermata Energy’s bidirectional electric vehicle charging system became the first to be certified to the North American safety standard, UL 9741, the Standard for Bidirectional Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging System Equipment.\n\nIn order to meet the 2030 target of 10 percent of Japan's energy being generated by renewable resources, a cost of $71.1 billion will be required for the upgrades of existing grid infrastructure. \nThe Japanese charging infrastructure market is projected to grow from $118.6 million to $1.2 billion between 2015 and 2020.\nStarting in 2012, Nissan plans to bring to market a kit compatible with the LEAF EV that will be able to provide power back into a Japanese home. \nCurrently, there is a prototype being tested in Japan. Average Japanese homes use 10 to 12 KWh/day, and with the LEAF's 24 KWh battery capacity, this kit could potentially provide up to two days of power. \nProduction in additional markets will follow upon Nissan's ability to properly complete adaptations.\n\nIn November 2018 in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture, Toyota Tsusho Corporation and Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc initiated charging and discharging demonstrations with storage batteries of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles using V2G technology. The demonstration examines how to excel the ability of V2G systems to balance demand and supply of electricity is and what impacts V2G has on the power grid. In addition to ordinary usage of EVs/PHVs such as by transportation, the group is producing new values of EVs/PHVs by providing V2G services even when EVs/PHVs are parked. Two bi-directional charging stations, connected to a V2G aggregation server managed by Nuvve Corporation, have been installed at a parking lot in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture to conduct the demonstration test. The group aims to assess the capacity of EVs/PHVs to balance out demand and supply of electrical power by charging EVs/PHVs and supplying electrical power to the grid from EVs/PHVs.\n\nDenmark currently is a world leader in wind power generation. \nInitially, Denmark's goal is to replace 10% of all vehicles with PEVs, with an ultimate goal of a complete replacement to follow. The Edison Project implements a new set of goals that will allow enough turbines to be built to accommodate 50% of total power while using V2G to prevent negative impacts to the grid. Because of the unpredictability of wind, the Edison Project plans to use PEVs while they are plugged into the grid to store additional wind energy that the grid cannot handle. Then, during peak energy use hours, or when the wind is calm, the power stored in these PEVs will be fed back into the grid. To aid in the acceptance of EVs, policies have been enforced that create a tax differential between zero emission cars and traditional automobiles. The Danish PEV market value is expected to grow from $50 to $380 million between 2015 and 2020. PEV developmental progress and advancements pertaining to the use of renewable energy resources will make Denmark a market leader with respect to V2G innovation (ZigBee 2010).\n\nFollowing the Edison project, the Nikola project was started which focused on demonstrating the V2G technology in a lab setting, located at the Risø Campus (DTU). DTU is a partner along with Nuvve and Nissan. The Nikola project completed in 2016, laying the groundwork for Parker, which uses a fleet of EVs to demonstrate the technology in a real-life setting. This project is partnered by DTU, Insero, Nuvve, Nissan and Frederiksberg Forsyning (Danish DSO in Copenhagen). Besides demonstrating the technology the project also aims to clear the path for V2G-integration with other OEMs as well as calculating the business case for several types of V2G, such as Adaptive charging, overload protection, peak shaving, emergency backup and frequency balancing. In the project the partners explored the most viable commercial opportunities by systematically testing and demonstrating V2G services across car brands. Here, economic and regulatory barriers were identified as well as the economic and technical impacts of the applications on the power system and markets. The project started in August 2016 and ended in September 2018.\n\nThe V2G market in the UK will be stimulated by aggressive smart grid and PEV rollouts. Starting in January 2011, programs and strategies to assist in PEV have been implemented. The UK has begun devising strategies to increase the speed of adoption of EVs. This includes providing universal high-speed internet for use with smart grid meters, because most V2G-capable PEVs will not coordinate with the larger grid without it. The \"Electric Delivery Plan for London\" states that by 2015, there will be 500 on-road charging stations; 2,000 stations off-road in car parks; and 22,000 privately owned stations installed. Local grid substations will need to be upgraded for drivers who cannot park on their own property. By 2020 in the UK, every residential home will have been offered a smart meter, and about 1.7 million PEVs should be on the road. The UK's electric vehicle market value is projected to grow from $0.1 to $1.3 billion between 2015 and 2020 (ZigBee 2010).\n\nIn 2018, EDF Energy announced a partnership with a leading green technology company, Nuvve, to install up to 1,500 Vehicle to Grid (V2G) chargers in the UK. The chargers will be offered to EDF Energy’s business customers and will be used at its own sites to provide up to 15 MW of additional energy storage capacity. That’s the equivalent amount of energy required to power 4,000 homes. The stored electricity will be made available for sale on the energy markets or for supporting grid flexibility at times of peak energy use. EDF Energy is the largest electricity supplier to UK businesses and its partnership with Nuvve could see the largest deployment of V2G chargers so far in this country.\n\nIn fall 2019, a consortium called Vehicle to Grid Britain (V2GB) released a research report on the potential of V2G technologies.\n\nDenmark's Edison project, an abbreviation for 'Electric vehicles in a Distributed and Integrated market using Sustainable energy and Open Networks' was a partially state funded research project on the island of Bornholm in Eastern Denmark. The consortium of IBM, Siemens the hardware and software developer EURISCO, Denmark's largest energy company Ørsted (formerly DONG Energy), the regional energy company Østkraft, the Technical University of Denmark and the Danish Energy Association, explored how to balance the unpredictable electricity loads generated by Denmark's many wind farms, currently generating approximately 20 percent of the country's total electricity production, by using electric vehicles (EV) and their accumulators. The aim of the project is to develop infrastructure that enables EVs to intelligently communicate with the grid to determine when charging, and ultimately discharging, can take place.\nAt least one rebuild V2G capable Toyota Scion will be used in the project.\nThe project is key in Denmark's ambitions to expand its wind-power generation to 50% by 2020.\nAccording to a source of British newspaper The Guardian 'It's never been tried at this scale' previously. \nThe project concluded in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) developed the first vehicle-to-grid aggregation system qualified by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The system allows for owners of electric delivery truck fleets to make money by assisting in managing the grid frequency. When the electric grid frequency drops below 60 Hertz, the system suspends vehicle charging which removes the load on the grid thus allowing the frequency to rise to a normal level. The system is the first of its kind because it operates autonomously.\n\nThe system was originally developed as part of the Smart Power Infrastructure Demonstration for Energy Reliability and Security (SPIDERS) Phase II program, led by Burns and McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. The goals of the SPIDERS program are to increase energy security in the event of power loss from a physical or cyber disruption, provide emergency power, and manage the grid more efficiently. In November 2012, SwRI was awarded a $7 million contract from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to demonstrate the integration of vehicle-to-grid technologies as a source for emergency power at Fort Carson, Colorado. In 2013, SwRI researchers tested five DC fast-charge stations at the army post. The system passed integration and acceptance testing in August 2013.\n\nProf. Dr. Ad van Wijk, Vincent Oldenbroek and Dr. Carla Robledo, researchers at Delft University of Technology, in 2016 conducted research on V2G technology with hydrogen FCEVs. Both experimental work with V2G FCEVs and techno-economic scenario studies for 100% renewable integrated energy and transport systems are done, using only hydrogen and electricity as energy carriers. They modified a Hyundai ix35 FCEV together with Hyundai R&D so it can deliver up to 10 kW DC Power while maintaining road access permit. They developed together with the company Accenda b.v. a V2G unit converting the DC power of the FCEV into 3-phase AC power and injecting it into the Dutch national electricity grid. The Future Energy Systems Group also recently did tests with their V2G FCEVs whether it could offer frequency reserves. Based on the positive outcome of the tests an MSc thesis was published looking into the technical and economic feasibility assessment of a hydrogen and FCEV based Car Park as Power Plant offering frequency reserves.\n\nWillett Kempton, Suresh Advani, and Ajay Prasad are the researchers at the University of Delaware who are currently conducting research on the V2G technology, with Dr. Kempton being the lead on the project. Dr. Kempton has published a number of articles on the technology and the concept, many of which can be found on the V2G project page. The group is involved in researching the technology itself, as well as its performance when used on the grid. In addition to the technical research, the team has worked with Dr. Meryl Gardner, a marketing professor in the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economic at the University of Delaware, to develop marketing strategies for both consumer and corporate fleet adoption. A 2006 Toyota Scion xB car was modified for testing in 2007.\n\nIn 2010, Kempton and Gregory Poilasne co-founded Nuvve, a V2G solutions company. The company has formed a number of industry partnerships and implemented V2G pilot projects on five continents worldwide.\n\nAt Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Dr. Samveg Saxena currently serves as the project lead for Vehicle-to-Grid Simulator (V2G-Sim). V2G-Sim is a simulation platform tool used to model spatial and temporal driving and charging behavior of individual plug-in electric vehicles on the electric grid. Its models are used to investigate the challenges and opportunities of V2G services, such as modulation of charging time and charging rate for peak demand response and utility frequency regulation. V2G-Sim has also been used to research the potential of plug-in electric vehicles for renewable energy integration. Preliminary findings using V2G-Sim have shown controlled V2G service can provide peak-shaving and valley-filling services to balance daily electric load and mitigate the duck curve. On the contrary, uncontrolled vehicle charging was shown to exacerbate the duck curve. The study also found that even at 20 percent fade in capacity, EV batteries still met the needs of 85 percent of drivers.\n\nIn another research initiative at Lawrence Berkeley Lab using V2G-Sim, V2G services were shown to have minor battery degradation impacts on electric vehicles as compared to cycling losses and calendar aging. In this study, three electric vehicles with different daily driving itineraries were modelled over a ten-year time horizon, with and without V2G services. Assuming daily V2G service from 7PM to 9PM at a charging rate of 1.440 kW, the capacity losses of the electric vehicles due to V2G over ten years were 2.68%, 2.66%, and 2.62%.\n\nIn May 2016, Nissan and Enel power company announced a collaborative V2G trial project in the United Kingdom, the first of its kind in the country. The trial comprises 100 V2G charging units to be used by Nissan Leaf and e-NV200 electric van users. The project claims electric vehicle owners will be able to sell stored energy back to the grid at a profit.\n\nOne notable V2G project in the United States is at the University of Delaware, where a V2G team headed by Dr. Willett Kempton has been conducting on-going research. An early operational implementation in Europe was conducted via the German government-funded MeRegioMobil project at the \"KIT Smart Energy Home\" of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in cooperation with Opel as vehicle partner and utility EnBW providing grid expertise. Their goals are to educate the public about the environmental and economic benefits of V2G and enhance the product market. Other investigators are the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Xcel Energy, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and, in the United Kingdom, the University of Warwick.\n\nWMG and Jaguar Land Rover collaborated with the Energy and Electrical Systems group of the university. Dr Kotub Uddin analysed lithium ion batteries from commercially available EVs over a two year period. He created a model of battery degradation and discovered that some patterns of vehicle-to-grid storage were able to significantly increase the longevity of the vehicle's battery over conventional charging strategies, while permitting them to be driven in normal ways. \nThere is some skepticism among experts about the feasibility of V2G and several studies have questioned the concept's economic rationale. For example, a 2015 study found that economic analyses favorable to V2G fail to include many of the less obvious costs associated with its implementation. When these less obvious costs are included, the study finds that V2G represents an economically inefficient solution.\n\nThe more a battery is used the sooner it needs replacing. Replacement cost is approximately 1/3 the cost of the electric car. \nOver their lifespan, batteries degrade progressively with reduced capacity, cycle life, and safety due to chemical changes to the electrodes. Capacity loss/fade is expressed as a percentage of initial capacity after a number of cycles (e.g., 30% loss after 1,000 cycles). \nCycling loss is due to usage and depends on both the maximum state of charge and the depth of discharge. \nJB Straubel, CTO of Tesla Inc., discounts V2G because battery wear outweighs economic benefit. \nHe also prefers recycling over re-use for grid once batteries have reached the end of their useful car life. \nA 2017 study found decreasing capacity, and a 2012 hybrid-EV study found minor benefit.\n\nAnother common criticism is related to the overall efficiency of the process.\nCharging a battery system and returning that energy from the battery to the grid, which includes \"inverting\" the DC power back to AC inevitably incurs some losses.\nThis needs to be factored against potential cost savings, along with increased emissions if the original source of power is fossil based. \nThis cycle of energy efficiency may be compared with the 70–80% efficiency of large-scale pumped-storage hydroelectricity, which is however limited by geography, water resources and environment.\n\nAdditionally, in order for V2G to work, it must be on a large scale basis. Power companies must be willing to adopt the technology in order to allow vehicles to give power back to the power grid. With vehicles giving power back to the grid, the aforementioned \"smart-meters\" would have to be in place in order to measure the amount of power being transferred to the grid.\n\nThere are several electric vehicles that have been modified or are design to be compatible with V2G.\nHyundai ix35 FCEV from Delft University of Technology is modified with a 10 kW DC V2G output.\nSome vehicles that have V2G capability include the REV 300 ACX, the Boulder Electric Vehicle 500 series and 1000 series trucks, the ACPropulsion T-Zero, E-box and MINI-E, the Nissan Leaf and Nissan e-NV200. The Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV has a Vehicle To Home system in Japan that is also planned for roll out in Europe.\n\n"}

Grove took her first dancing lessons at age 4 and at 11 was performing professionally by singing and dancing for service clubs in Cambridge.\n\nShe attended Longfellow Grammar School and Cambridge High and Latin School. As a high school student, she performed for department stores' fashion shows in Boston.\n\nIn 1950, Grove debuted on Broadway in the 1948 original production of \"Kiss Me, Kate\", playing Lois Lane/Bianca, a lead role that was originated by Lisa Kirk (whom she replaced). She appeared on Broadway in three other shows as well: The 1968 original production of \"George M!\"; the 1979 original production of \"I Remember Mama\"; and the 1983 revival of \"On Your Toes\".\n\nGrove's network television debut came on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in 1949. That same year, after three auditions, she became the featured singer on ABC-TV's \"Stop the Music\". A 1951 review of \"Stop the Music\" emphasized the \"showmanly flair of Miss Grove and [Bert] Parks.\" In a 1952 magazine article, Parks described Grove's activities during five months in 1950 when she was in both \"Stop the Music\" on TV and \"Kiss Me Kate\" on Broadway: At 7:30 every Thursday night she would rush into a dressing room at ABC's Ritz Theatre on West 48th Street, change into her TV costume, tear on stage for her numbers, change again into her first act \"Kiss Me Kate\" togs, make a beeline for the Shubert Theatre on West 44th Street, arriving just in time for her on-stage cue. All this following a full day of rehearsing.

Roughly 340 EV Plus models were produced and released. Production of the EV Plus was discontinued in 1999 after Honda announced the release of its first hybrid electric vehicle, the Honda Insight. \n\nThe EV Plus served to test advanced battery chemistry in an electric car and also met California Air Resources Board requirements for zero-emission vehicles, like the General Motors EV1. It also tested the pancake-style motor, electronic control unit, power control unit and the Nickel–metal hydride battery (NiMH) later used in Honda hybrids and developed further in the first Honda FCX Fuel Cell Vehicles, which were rebuilt from returned (decommissioned) EV Plus chassis.\n\nHonda began development of an electric vehicle (EV) in April 1988, inspired in part by the General Motors Sunraycer, which won the World Solar Challenge in 1987, and with an intent to meet increasingly stringent future emissions standards. The first electric vehicle team at Honda had just four people. At the time, Honda was the last automotive company in Japan to start work on electric vehicles.\n\nEarly obstacles were discovered; electric traction motors that were powerful or efficient were too large to fit, energy storage density using existing lead-acid technology was similarly too low, and the time required to recharge was inconvenient. Besides the technical challenges, California issued a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate in late 1990, requiring manufacturers to sell 2% of their total sales as ZEVs, starting in 1998. With that in mind, Honda devoted approximately 100 employees to begin full-scale EV development early in 1991.\n\nA first prototype was designed, based on the existing three-door hatchback Civic, retrofitted with commercially-available electric motor and lead-acid batteries, and modified with numerous weight-saving measures, including aluminum body panels and acrylic plastic windows; it was completed in July 1991 and ran without issues. Although EV project team members were relieved that it was operable, project leader Junichi Araki was furious: \"You call this a car? What the heck did you just make? Why don't you just dig a hole, and bury it!\" Over the next two hours, Araki explained his anger: the finished product was a shameful compromise and merely an excuse for Honda's inexperience with EVs. \"As long as we continue trying a variety of measures in a project, each car we produce must constitute a learning experience that leads to the next step. If a car doesn't lead to greater experience, we might as well not build it. I was so disappointed that they hadn't put more passion into the project.\" The team refocused their goal \"to make a good electric vehicle, with no compromises.\"\n\nAs an example, the Honda EV project's powerplant team began working with battery manufacturers, proposing a battery format and size that were later adopted as a global standard. In addition, they began developing their own DC brushless motor, since commercially-available motors were not efficient enough. By June 1992, Honda had begun development of a purpose-built prototype, which led to the EV-X, a working concept vehicle exhibited at Tokyo in 1993, then powertrain testing with the Clean Urban Vehicle-4 (CUV-4), a converted Civic hatchback, gathering test data starting in August 1994. Over the next two years, the fleet of ten CUV-4s would be driven for an aggregate in partnership with California utilities Pacific Gas & Electric (operating five) and Southern California Edison (three).\n\nThese tests convinced Honda that lead-acid batteries were unsuitable as the main storage for a production-level electric vehicle. The CUV-4 had a limited range of just , prompting tweaks to the basic vehicle specifications that were later realized in the EV Plus, including battery voltage, chemistry, and motor power. A prototype EV Plus was assembled in December 1995, and production was approved in January 1996; the first production EV Plus left the line at Takanezawa in April 1997.\n\nThe EV Plus featured on-board conductive charging with the Avcon connector, passive battery balancing, regenerative braking and deceleration, AC/heat-pump climate control, HID headlights, 4 seats, and electrically heated windshield. The car was equipped with an oil-fired heater for faster cabin heating and passenger comfort, but the heater was not operable until the ambient temperature was below to comply with California ZEV standards. The heater had an output of .\n\nThe EV Plus came with a 12 V battery to power standard automotive accessories and lighting.\n\nVehicles also featured:\n\n\nThe traction motor output rating was at 8,750 RPM and .\n\nBattery capacity was 28.7 kW-hr; the battery weighed and occupied a volume of . Using a 110-volt \"emergency\" charger, approximately 24 hours were required for a complete charge; in contrast, the 220-volt charger was able to restore 80% of charge in 2 hours. Under instrumented testing, the EV Plus required approximately 7 hours to fully charge its battery at a rate of just over 5 kW.\n\nAt introduction, Honda cautioned potential drivers that actual driving range was limited to . Southern California Edison tested a Honda EV Plus at Pomona, California and determined the range was between (freeway loop, with auxiliary loads) to (urban loop, without auxiliary loads). As with virtually all vehicles, range was affected by driving style: rapid acceleration, high speeds, and fast stops lowered the all-electric range significantly. United States Environmental Protection Agency rated the range at , and careful driving would give it a range of just over . Consumption is rated at ; using an electricity equivalent of 33.7 kW-hr per gallon of gasoline, that gives an equivalent efficiency of combined, city/highway.\n\nA race-prepared EV Plus set a new record for electric vehicles at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in 1999 by finishing in 15:19.91. The special EV Plus, prepared and driven by Teruo Sugita, had been converted to mid-engine, rear-wheel drive and fitted with extra batteries.\n\nThe EV Plus was listed with an MSRP of $53,999, but Honda never allowed them to be sold, instead offering the cars on a 3-year, lease-only program for $455.00 per month. The cost of the battery pack alone was estimated at , and consumers were warned the battery would need to be replaced every three years, necessitating the lease program. Lease customers were required to install a 220-volt charger. The lease cost included comprehensive collision coverage, all maintenance, and roadside assistance.\n\nThe EV Plus was first available to California drivers starting on May 14, 1997, with four dealerships (three in Southern California and one in Sacramento) offering the new model; eight were leased within a week of release. By December, only 79 had been leased. From May 1997 to July 1998, Honda leased 177 EV Plus vehicles in southern California. 15 EV Plus vehicles were leased to the University of California, Riverside as the basis of a car-sharing program; on average, 100 trips per day were taken by faculty, staff, and students, with most trips lasting less than . The final EV Plus was assembled in April 1999; in total, approximately 325 were leased to customers: 300 in the United States, 20 in Japan, and 5 in Europe.\n\nAt the time Honda announced it would discontinue production, it promised to continue to re-lease and service the EV Plus indefinitely. Honda allowed some customers to extend their EV Plus lease for a few years. At the end of the leases, all EV Plus cars were taken back by Honda, decommissioned, and eventually destroyed. A few Honda EV Plus chassis were used as the base for some of Honda's first hydrogen () fuel cell vehicle prototypes.\n\nThe platform and drivetrain of the EV Plus were reused for the Honda FCX, a fuel cell vehicle. Instead of the high-voltage traction battery of the EV Plus, the FCX used hydrogen stored on-board in a fuel cell reactor to generate electricity. Then those prototypes were also destroyed.\n\n"}

The coastal regions are covered with Mangrove swamps, rain forest and tangled forest.\n\nTombali is divided into five sectors namely Bedanda, Cacine, Catio, and Komo. Guinea-Bissau got independence from Portugal on 24 September 1973 after wars and diplomatic political actions under the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), while Portugal accepted the independence of Cape Verde on 5 July 1975. PAIGC ruled both the countries after independence. While international funds came pouring in for the economic development of the nation, the party was accused of misusing power in authoritarian manner. The one-party state mechanism was turbulent during the period of 1980s and 1990s with army taking control of power more frequently and the resultant civil war resulted in loss of property and lives. To decentralize power, an administrative region and eight regions were created. There has not been any local administration since the civil war of 1998-99 and all the social services are done by organs of civil society and other government agencies. There is minimal health and education services offered by the government and all the government departments have operated in a limited fashion.

The series was internationally controversial, and was not screened by the UK channel which commissioned it, BBC Three.\n\nThe series follows the doodles and scribblings of a student at school during a lesson. His drawings depict the life of Father Nicholas, who lives in a Vatican City parody referred to as \"Popetown\". He is charged with being the handler for the Pope (who is always referred to by his title, and never given any name) who is a complete nincompoop with the emotional and mental maturity of a four-year-old. Father Nicholas must keep the Pope out of trouble, and make sure the general public does not find out that the Holy Father is a drooling idiot. Other characters include a priest who is a sexual deviant, an extremely buxom and vain nun who serves as the Popetown news anchor and a trio of corrupt cardinals who secretly run Popetown and attempt to get rich behind the Pope's back. These and other elements caused the show to be extremely controversial.\n\nThe original English-language version of the show features the voices of actor and \"Popetown\" writer Mackenzie Crook, \"Little Britain\" co-creator Matt Lucas, providing the voice for one of the cardinals, and actress Jerry Hall. Ruby Wax is the voice actor for The Pope.\n\nThe series was originally commissioned by BBC Three in the United Kingdom, but was dropped from scheduling without a screening in the wake of protests from Roman Catholics. The premiere screened on New Zealand's C4 television network on 8 June 2005. Despite never being shown on British television, it was eventually released on DVD in the UK by Revolver Entertainment on 5 September 2005, in Australia by Roadshow Entertainment and in Germany, where it was aired on television, by Polyband. It is also currently aired on several MTV channels, including MTV Latin America, MTV Latvia, MTV Estonia and others. The show was also banned in some countries (for example, Lithuania).\n\nThe Catholic Church in New Zealand had been considering laying a complaint to the Broadcasting Standards Authority . Bishops called for a boycott of all CanWest television and radio stations. C4 had received many complaints about the show but refused to pull it from its lineup.\n\nIn Germany, where insulting religious groups is a crime, MTV broadcast the first episode on 3 May 2006. After an advertisement was published at the start of the Holy Week featuring Jesus in a chair watching TV (with the heading \"laugh instead of hanging around\"), both MTV and the series drew sharp criticism from some Christians in Germany; the office of the archbishop of Munich said it is investigating an injunction to block the series. \"Popetown\" became a topic of public debate, even though few have had the opportunity to see the show.\n\nThe Christian Churches as well as the Jewish and Muslim Community and conservative politicians demanded that MTV withdraw the series. An evangelical magazine has put up an anti-Popetown website, \"stoppt-popetown.de\". The Archbishop of Munich and the parliamentary leader of the conservative CSU party in Bavaria demanded criminal prosecution of those responsible for the series under § 166 of the Penal Code, the \"blasphemy clause\". Edmund Stoiber, leader of the CSU, also demanded more severe punishments for slander of religious feelings.\n\nNondenominational organizations like the IBKA and others argued that satire must be allowed and censorship must not take place. Supporters of the series brought forward the argument that Popetown cannot be forbidden, just as the Muhammad cartoons are allowed for reasons of press freedom.\n\nAfter a discussion on MTV, which ended up with some 87% of online voters supporting broadcast, MTV decided to broadcast all of the other episodes. The experts taking position in the show said they would not broadcast it, but also not forbid it.\n\nThe series has yet to be broadcast or released on DVD in the United States, but it has spread by word of mouth, YouTube, and file sharing networks. In the 20 April 2006 edition of his weekly column, Parents Television Council founder L. Brent Bozell wrote an article criticizing Viacom for airing this anti-Christian series on MTV Germany as well as allowing a scene defacing Jesus Christ in the episode of the American animated series \"South Park\", \"Cartoon Wars Part II\". In America, \"South Park\" is broadcast on the Viacom network Comedy Central.\n\nIn March 2007, the MTV Baltics network was fined 3,000 litas (896 EUR) by the Lithuanian broadcasting regulator for airing the animation.

It was destroyed by Hurricane Emily in 2005; a replacement, Joyxee Island, has been open for tours since 2008.\n\nSpiral Island has been featured in a number of newspapers and TV documentaries around the world, including in Japan and South Korea, and has been featured in an episode of the \"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\" TV series, and on the MTV program \"Extreme Cribs\" in 2011.\n\nThe first Spiral island was located in a lagoon near Puerto Aventuras, on the Caribbean coast of Mexico south of Cancún; Richart Sowa began constructing it in 1998. He filled nets with empty discarded plastic bottles to support a structure of plywood and bamboo, on which he poured sand and planted numerous plants, including mangroves. The island sported a two-story house, a solar oven, a self-composting toilet, and three beaches. He used some 250,000 bottles for the structure. \n\nSowa was ordered to take the island out of the man-made canal in 2004 because many private homes and condos were being built and he lived for one year tied to the end of a loose rock pier. Sowa was offered a new location in the bay of Soliman about 200 km (124 mi) south, Finally, he was permitted by Port authorities to tow Spiral Island but the island was destroyed by Hurricane Emily in 2005.\n\nIn late 2007 and 2008, Sowa built a replacement for Spiral Island in the waters of Isla Mujeres, the \"Island of Women\", also near Cancun. It opened for tours in August 2008. \n\nThe new island was initially in diameter and contained about 100,000 bottles. It has since expanded to 25 metres (82 ft) due to various plants and mangroves growing from the island. The new island has three beaches, a house, two ponds, a wave-powered washing machine, solar panels, a solar-powered waterfall and river. The island is a constant work in progress with volunteers and Sowa himself continually making improvements.\n\nIn May 2011, Reishee embarked on a project to berth his island out in Isla Mujeres Bay, as it was now too big for its current site off a pier in Laguna Majax. The Mexican Government also recognized Joyxee Island as an \"Eco Boat\" and therefore needed to comply with all current boating regulations, which involved the purchase of fire extinguishers, life ring buoys and emergency kits. The project was launched on kickstarter.com with a goal of $18,000 that it failed to reach. Reishee later successfully relaunched the project with a more conservative $9,000 goal.\n\nNotes\n"}

Hence, with the focus on the nature of \"rights\", he proposed a system of analysis based on \"jural correlatives\" and \"jural opposites\". A correlative is where two concepts are logically consistent and the one necessarily implies the other. When two concepts are Hohfeldian opposites (technically, logical contradictions), they are mutually exclusive.\n\nThus, if A has a right with regard to B, an analysis of their relationship from B's point of view must imply that B has a duty to A. An owner of land may hold four distinct entitlements: rights, privileges, powers, and immunities. Hohfeld linked each entitlement to a corelative and its opposite:\n\nJurists such as Mickey Dias and Hohfeld have declared that rights and duties are \"jural corelatives\", which means that if someone has a right, \"someone else\" owes a duty to him. This reasoning of Dias' was used in \"Murphy v Brentwood District Council\" (1991) to disapprove Lord Denning MR's judgment in \"Dutton v Bognor Regis Urban District Council\" (1972).\n\n\n"}

The Imperial Japanese government first started issuing the military yen during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. The military yen reached its peak during the Pacific War period, when the Japanese government excessively issued it to all of its occupied territories. In Hong Kong, the military yen was forced upon the local population as the sole official currency of the territory. Since the military yen was not backed by gold, and did not have a specific place of issuance, the military yen could not be exchanged for the Japanese yen. Forcing local populations to use the military yen officially was one of the ways the Japanese government could dominate the local economies.\n\nThe territories controlled or occupied by Japan had many different currencies. Taiwan maintained its own banking system and bank notes after it came under Japanese sovereignty in 1895. The same is true for Korea post 1910. Between 1931 and 1945, large parts of China and South East Asia were occupied by Japan. Several types of currencies were put into circulation there during the occupation. In China, several puppet governments were created (e.g. Manchukuo), each issuing their own currency. In South East Asia, the Japanese military arranged for bank notes to be issued, denominated in the various currencies (rupees, pesos, dollars, etc.) that had been circulating there prior to the occupation. These latter are referred to as Japanese invasion money. In addition to these currencies, the Japanese military issued their own bank notes, denominated in yen - this is the Japanese military yen. The military yen became the official currency in some occupied areas, e.g. Hong Kong.\n\nIn the late 1930s there was an issue of military yen which was similar to the standard yen in terms of design, but with minor modifications. Generally, thick red lines were overprinted to cancel the name \"Bank of Japan\" (日本銀行) and any text promising to pay the bearer in gold or silver. Large red text instead indicated that the note was military currency (\"軍用手票\") so as not to be confused with regular Japanese yen.\n\nLater series were less crude. In the early 1940s, the Japanese government issued military yen notes with a design prepared specifically for the military yen. These designs were not based on existing Japanese yen notes, but featured original designs such as Onagadori cocks and dragons. All later series featured the following text on the reverse of the note:\n\nThis text explains: \"This note is exchangeable to Japanese currency upon presentation. Severe punishment will be applied to anyone who counterfeits notes or knowingly uses such notes.\"\n\nEarly issues did not have serial numbers, and were issued without regard for inflation. Later issues did initially feature serial numbers. Towards the end of the war, as more money was needed to pay military personnel, notes were issued without serial numbers once more.\n\nAfter the Hong Kong Government surrendered to the Japanese Imperial Army on 25 December 1941, the Japanese authorities decreed the military yen to be the legal tender of Hong Kong the following day. \n\nThe Japanese occupation also outlawed any use of Hong Kong dollar and set a deadline for exchanging dollars into yen.\n\nWhen the military yen was first introduced on 26 December 1941, the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the military yen was 2 to 1. However, by October 1942, the rate was changed to 4 to 1.\n\nAfter exchanging for Hong Kong dollars, the Japanese military purchased supplies and strategic goods in the neighbouring neutral Portuguese colony of Macao.\n\nAs Japan became more desperate in the war effort in 1944, the Japanese military authorities in Hong Kong circulated more military yen, resulting in hyperinflation.\n\nAfter Japan announced its unconditional surrender on 15 August 1945, military yen banknotes were seized by British military authorities. However, although there was about as much as 1.9 billion yen, the Japanese military administrations intentionally destroyed 700 million worth of it.\n\nOn 6 September 1945, the Japanese Ministry of Finance announced that all military yen became void, reducing the military yen to useless pieces of paper.\n\nOn 13 August 1993, an organization in Hong Kong seeking a refund for military yen took legal action against Japan, suing the Japanese government for the money that was lost when the military yen was declared void. A Tokyo district court ruled against the plaintiff on 17 June 1999, stating that, although it acknowledged the suffering of the Hong Kong people, the government of Japan did not have specific laws concerning military yen compensation. Japan also used the Treaty of San Francisco, of which the United Kingdom was a signatory state, as one of the reasons to deny compensation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2008475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008475", "title": "Mensural notation", "text": "Mensural notation\n\nMensural notation is the musical notation system used for European vocal polyphonic music from the later part of the 13th century until about 1600. The term \"mensural\" refers to the ability of this system to describe precisely measured rhythmic durations in terms of numerical proportions between note values. Its modern name is inspired by the terminology of medieval theorists, who used terms like \"musica mensurata\" (\"measured music\") or \"cantus mensurabilis\" (\"measurable song\") to refer to the rhythmically defined polyphonic music of their age, as opposed to \"musica plana\" or \"musica choralis\", i.e., Gregorian plainchant. Mensural notation was employed principally for compositions in the tradition of vocal polyphony, whereas plainchant retained its own, older system of neume notation throughout the period. Besides these, some purely instrumental music could be written in various forms of instrument-specific tablature notation.\n\nMensural notation grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called rhythmic modes, which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise \"Ars cantus mensurabilis\" (\"The art of measured chant\") by Franco of Cologne (). A much expanded system allowing for greater rhythmic complexity was introduced in France with the stylistic movement of the Ars nova in the 14th century, while Italian 14th-century music developed its own, somewhat different variant. Around 1400, the French system was adopted across Europe, and became the standard form of notation of the Renaissance music of the 15th and 16th centuries. After around 1600, mensural notation gradually evolved into modern measure (or bar) notation.\n\nThe decisive innovation of mensural notation was the systematic use of different note shapes to denote rhythmic durations that stood in well-defined, hierarchical numerical relations to each other. While less context dependent than notation in rhythmic modes, mensural notation differed from the modern system in that the values of notes were still somewhat context-dependent. In particular, a note could have the length of either two or three units of the next smaller order, whereas in modern notation these relations are invariably binary. Whether a note was to be read as ternary (\"perfect\") or binary (\"imperfect\") was a matter partly of context rules and partly of a system of mensuration signs comparable to modern time signatures. There was also a complex system of temporarily shifting note values by proportion factors like 2:1 or 3:2. Mensural notation used no bar lines, and it sometimes employed special connected note forms (ligatures) inherited from earlier medieval notation. Unlike in the earliest beginnings of the writing of polyphonic music, and unlike in modern practice, mensural notation was usually not written in a score arrangement but in individual parts.\n\nMensural notation was extensively described and codified by contemporary theorists. As these writings, like all academic work of the time, were usually in Latin, many features of the system are still conventionally referred to by their Latin terms.\n\nThe system of note types used in mensural notation closely corresponds to the modern system. The mensural \"brevis\" is nominally the ancestor of the modern double whole note (breve); likewise, the \"semibrevis\" corresponds to the whole note (semibreve), the \"minima\" to the half note (minim), the \"semiminima\" to the quarter note (crotchet), and the \"fusa\" to the eighth note (quaver). Very rarely, mensural notation also used yet smaller subdivisions, such as the \"semifusa\" (corresponding to the sixteenth note or semiquaver). On the other hand, there were also two larger values, the \"longa\" (quadruple whole note or long) and the \"maxima\" (or \"duplex longa\", called a \"large\" in Britain), which are no longer in regular use today.\n\nDespite these nominal equivalences, each note had a much shorter temporal value than its modern counterpart. Between the 14th and 16th centuries, composers repeatedly introduced new note shapes for ever smaller temporal divisions of rhythm, and the older, longer notes were slowed down in proportion. The basic metrical relationship of a long to a short beat shifted from longa–breve in the 13th century, to breve–semibreve in the 14th, to semibreve–minim by the end of the 15th, and finally to minim–semiminim (i.e., half and quarter notes, or minim and crotchet) in modern notation. Thus, what was originally the shortest of all note values used, the semibreve, has become the longest note used routinely today, the whole note.\n\nOriginally, all notes were written in solid, filled-in form (\"black notation\"). In the mid-15th century, scribes began to use hollow note shapes (\"white notation\"), reserving black shapes only for the smallest note values. This change was probably motivated by the change from parchment to paper as the most common writing material, as paper was less suited to holding large dots of ink.\n\nAs with the notes, the shapes of the rest symbols in mensural notation are already similar to their modern descendants (with the smaller values being successively introduced in the course of the period of mensural notation). The rest symbols of the larger values had a clear visual logic reflecting their time durations, based on the breve rest being a vertical stroke the length of one staff space. For the longa rests, a visual distinction was made depending on whether the longa was imperfect (two breves long) or perfect. Accordingly, their signs were visually twice or three times the length of a breve rest respectively, while the semibreve rest was half that length. Maxima rests, in turn, were groups of two or three longa rests combined. If several longa rests followed each other, groups of either two or three of them were written together on the same staff line to indicate whether they were supposed to be grouped into perfect or imperfect maxima units.\n\nLigatures are groups of notes written together, usually indicating melismatic singing of the same syllable over several notes. Ligature forms exist only for the larger note values from the semibreve upwards. Their use in mensural notation was a holdover from the earlier modal rhythmic system, of which they inherited some of their rhythmic meaning.\n\nThe rhythmic values of ligatures in modal notation had been based on a metric reinterpretation of the ligature neumes used since much earlier in the notation of Gregorian plainchant. In modal notation, ligatures represented stereotyped rhythmic sequences of short and long notes, typically involving groups of one or more initial short notes (i.e., breves) and one final long note (i.e., a longa). In mensural notation, this rule was generalized, with all other rhythmic combinations being classified in terms of deviation from this basic pattern. In medieval terminology, a ligature possessed \"perfectio\" (\"perfection\") if its final note was a longa (L), and it had \"proprietas\" (\"its [normal] property\") if its first note was a breve (B).\n\nAccordingly, a note pair of B–L \"(cum proprietate et cum perfectione)\" could be written with the most basic of ligature shapes, those inherited from plainchant, namely the descending \"clivis\" () and the ascending \"podatus\" (). Likewise, three-note groups of B–B–L could be written with some of the inherited ternary neumes, such as the \"porrectus\" (, direction down–up), the \"torculus\" (, direction up–down), or the \"scandicus\" (, direction up–up).\n\nIf, by way of exception, the first note was to be a longa, this was signaled by a reversal of its visual \"property\", namely the use of initial stems: the descending clivis had its downward stem removed (), while, conversely, the ascending podatus had one added to it ( or ).\n\nOn the other hand, if the final note was to be a breve \"(sine perfectione)\", this was signaled by a change in the noteheads themselves: the descending sequence of square heads was replaced with a single diagonal beam (), while the ascending podatus had its second note folded out to the right (). Both sequences correspond to the initial B–B segments of the ternary porrectus and torculus respectively.\n\nIf both exceptions co-occurred \"(sine proprietate et sine perfectione)\", both graphical alterations were combined accordingly.\n\nIn addition to sequences of longa and breve, ligatures could also contain pairs of semibreves (but not normally a single one). These were called \"cum opposita proprietate\", and always marked by an upward-pointing stem to the left of the note pair.\n\nThere were also some alternate versions of the ascending ligatures. Thus, the basic ascending B–L podatus shape was replaced by one where the second note was both folded out to the right and marked with an extra stem (), as if these two modifications were meant to cancel each other out. The ascending L–L \"(sine proprietate)\" was modified accordingly.\n\nLigatures could contain any number of notes. In multi-note ligatures, the rules about initial and final values are applied in analogy to those in the binary forms. In addition, the following rules hold for notes in all positions:\n\n\nMensural notation distinguished between several basic metric patterns of a piece of music, which were defined as combinations of ternary and binary subdivisions of time on successive hierarchical levels and roughly correspond to modern bar structures. The division of the semibreve into minims was called \"prolatio\", that of the breve into semibreves was called \"tempus\", and that of the longa into breves was known as \"modus\". The division of the maxima into longas was called \"modus maximarum\" or \"modus maior\"; in the modern literature it is also sometimes called \"maximodus\". Each of these levels could be either perfect (ternary) or imperfect (binary). The two types of prolatio were also known as \"major prolation\" and \"minor prolation\" respectively.\n\nThe perfect modus and maximodus became rare in practice after the 14th century. Of most practical importance were the subdivisions from the breve downwards, as by that time the semibreves rather than the breves had taken over the function of the basic counting unit. The four possible combinations of tempus and prolatio could be signaled by a set of mensuration signs at the beginning of a composition: a circle for tempus perfectum, a semicircle for tempus imperfectum, each combined with a dot for prolatio maior, or no dot for prolatio minor. These correspond to modern measures of , , , and respectively (assuming a reduction factor of 1:4 in transcription, i.e., mapping mensural minims to modern quavers), or alternatively , , and respectively (with a reduction factor of 1:2). In each case, one breve corresponds to one modern bar. In addition, each of these basic patterns had a diminished (\"diminutum\") variant, indicated by a vertical stroke through the sign (, , , ). These so-called \"cut signs\" indicated a reduction of all temporal values by a factor of two. (The signs and are the source of the modern \"common time\" and \"alla breve\" signatures and respectively.) A reversed semicircle was usually understood to be the same as .\n\nThere were normally no special signs for indicating the higher divisions of modus and maximodus. However, groups of longa rests at the beginning of a piece (which occurred frequently, as often some voices in a polyphonic composition would enter later than others) could be used as an indicator of the intended meter. If longa rests were written across three staff spaces, they were perfect; moreover, if they occurred in groups of three written together on the same staff line they indicated perfect maximodus. Occasionally, if no voice happened to have a sufficiently long rest at the beginning of the piece, a dummy rest symbol of one maxima's worth of longae would be written to the left of the mensuration sign; in that case it was understood as part of the time signature and not actually executed as a rest.\n\nThe time value of some notes could change according to their immediate context in certain situations. The rules for this were developed on the basis of the typical rhythmic nature of medieval music in the 13th century. Most of this music followed the same basic metric pattern, which in modern notation would be written as a swift (or ) meter. Thus, melodies consisted mainly of ternary long notes (in modern notation, dotted minims), or alternating sequences of binary long notes and short notes (minims and crotchets), or groups of three short notes. In the 13th century, all of these were notated using only the longa and breve notes. A longa was automatically understood to fill a whole ternary metric group whenever it was in the neighborhood of other notes that did the same, i.e., whenever it was followed either by another longa or by a full group of three breves. When, however, the longa was preceded or followed by a single breve, then both filled a ternary group together. Thus, the longa had to be reduced to a value of two (it was \"imperfected\"). When, finally, there were only two breves in between two longae, then the two breves had to fill up a metrical group together. This was done by lengthening the second breve \"(brevis altera)\" to a value of two, while the first \"(brevis recta)\" kept its normal value.\n\nAt the earliest stage, this basic principle applied only to the relation between longa and breve. Beginning with Franco of Cologne, the same pattern was also applied between breves and semibreves, and finally, with Philippe de Vitry's theory of the Ars nova, it was taken yet another level down, to the newly introduced minims. From that time onwards, imperfection and alteration could happen on the level of breves and semibreves whenever the piece was in tempus perfectum, and it could happen between semibreves and minims if the piece was in prolatio maior. The divisions below the minim were invariably binary. Theorists developed an intricate set of precedence rules for when and how to apply imperfection, together with a complex terminology for its different types.\n\nNormally, a note was imperfected by one of the next smaller order, e.g., a breve (B) by a semibreve (Sb), and thereby lost one third of its own nominal value (ex. [a–c]). This was called \"full imperfection\" \"(imperfectio ad totum)\". It could be induced either backwards (\"a parte post\"), or forwards (\"a parte ante\", ex. [c]). If both readings were possible, backwards imperfection took precedence. The smaller unit could also be replaced by a group of yet smaller notes of equivalent length, e.g., a semibreve's worth of minims or semiminims (ex. [d]). Imperfection could also apply recursively, for instance with an Sb imperfecting a preceding B and being itself imperfected by a following minim (ex. [e]), if the meter was suitable (e.g., tempus perfectum and prolatio maior).\n\nImperfection typically occurred if two larger notes were separated by a single smaller unit, as in a sequence of B–Sb–B–Sb. If, however, they were separated by a group of either two or three of the smaller units, there was no imperfection: in the case of two, alteration was applied instead (ex. [f]); while in the case of three the group was simply left to fill the space of a perfect unit by themselves (ex. [g]). If, in turn, there was a longer sequence of four or more smaller units before the next longer value, then the first of them induced imperfection (ex. [h]). Imperfection was barred on any note that was followed directly by another of the same order \"(similis ante similem perfecta)\". Thus, the middle part of a sequence like could only be written using alteration (as shown in ex.[f]); the use of imperfection like in ex.(c) was excluded, because the presence of the subsequent breve blocked it.\n\nThe normal reading of the groups could be overridden by placing a separator dot \"(punctus divisionis)\" between the notes to indicate which of them were meant to form a ternary unit together (ex. [i]). If the separator dot was placed after a potentially ternary note (e.g., a breve in tempus perfectum), it typically had the effect of keeping it perfect, i.e., overriding an imperfection that would otherwise have applied to it. In these cases it was also called \"punctus perfectionis\". Besides this, a dot could also be used in the same way as today: when it was placed after a note that was nominally binary (e.g., a breve in tempus imperfectum), it augmented it by one half \"(punctus augmentationis)\".\n\nIn some situations, imperfection could be induced not by a note of the next smaller order but by an even smaller one. For instance, a breve in prolatio maior, which could be thought of as being composed of two perfect semibreves, could be imperfected by an adjacent minim, taking away one third of one of its two halves, thus reducing its total length from 6 to 5 (ex.[j]). This was called \"partial imperfection\" \"(imperfectio ad partem)\". Imperfection involving note values two orders apart (e.g., a breve by a minim, or a longa by a semibreve) was called \"imperfection of an immediate part\" \"(ad partem propinquam)\"; while the (rarer) case where it occurred across even greater distances (e.g., between a longa and a minim) was known as \"imperfection of a remote part\" (\"ad partem remotam\", ex. [k]). Finally, partial imperfection could also apply from both sides of a long note at once (\"ad partes\", ex [l–m]). In this way, a note that was nominally 9 beats long could be reduced to any value down to 4, or a note that was 12 beats long to any value down to 7.\n\nRests, unlike notes, had an invariable duration and could not be imperfected or altered; however, they could induce imperfection or alteration on a neighboring note.\n\nAn individual composition was not limited to a single set of tempus and prolatio. Meters could be shifted in the course of a piece, either by inserting a new mensuration sign, or by using numeric proportions. A \"3\" indicates that all notes will be reduced to one-third of their value; a \"2\" indicates double tempo; a fraction \"\" indicates three in the time of two, and so forth. The proportion 2 is usually understood to have the same effect as the use of a cut sign with a vertical stroke ( = ).\n\nThe use of numeric proportions can interact with the use of different basic mensurations in fairly complex ways. This has led to a certain amount of uncertainty and controversy over the correct interpretation of these notation devices, both in contemporary theory and in modern scholarship.\nAnother way of altering the metrical value of notes was coloration. This refers to the device of literally marking a note as rhythmically exceptional by writing it in a different color. In the earlier period, when normal notes were black, the exceptional ones were written in red, or sometimes hollow. In the later period, the practice was reversed; as the normal notes were now hollow, the exceptional ones were filled out in black. In either case, \"colored\" notes are understood to have of their normal duration, and are always imperfect with respect to their next smaller sub-divisions.\n\nColoration applied to a group of breves (ex. [a]) was known as \"color temporis\", while that of a group of semibreves (ex. [b–c]) was called \"color prolationis\". The resulting rhythmic effect, as expressed in modern notation, differs somewhat according to whether the affected notes were normally perfect or imperfect according to the basic mensuration of the music. Applied to perfect notes (ex. [a–b]), coloration creates the effect of a hemiola: three binary rhythmic groups in the space normally taken up by two ternary ones, but with the next smaller time units (semibreves in [a], minims in [b]) remaining constant. When applied to notes that were already imperfect according to their normal values (ex. [c]), coloration results in the effect of a group of triplets, with all rhythmic units reduced by two thirds. Another special form of coloration was that applied to a group of a single semibreve and a following minim, called \"minor color\" (ex. [d]). Whereas it would logically be expected to result in a triplet group (), it was instead conventionally executed as a dotted group equivalent to a dotted minim and a semiminim (note that in the context of white notation, the colored – i.e., blackened – version of the minim in the \"minor color\" group happened to look just like a normal semiminim anyway, even though nominally it was considered a different type of note.)\n\nThe use of colored notes (at that time written in red) was introduced by Philippe de Vitry and flourished in the so-called ars subtilior of the late 14th century.\n\nThe example above, the chanson \"Belle, bonne, sage\" by Baude Cordier, written in a heart-shaped manuscript, is a rhythmically complex piece of ars subtilior. It uses several notation techniques for shifting between rhythms:\n\nSometimes, music was written in such a way that the same line of music had to be performed under two or more mensuration schemes, typically leading to slower (augmented) and faster (diminished) versions of the same passage. In such cases, the music was typically notated only once, and several different mensuration signs were placed in front of it together, often supplemented with a verbal instruction of how it should be executed (called a \"canon\").\n\nThis technique could be applied both successively and simultaneously. Successive mensural canons were a characteristic feature of late 14th and early 15th century isorhythmic motets. A famous example is \"Nuper rosarum flores\" by Guillaume Dufay, where the tenor (notated all in longa and a few breve values) is performed first as tempus perfectum (), then tempus imperfectum (), then tempus imperfectum diminutum (), and finally tempus perfectum diminutum (), leading to length relations of 6:4:2:3 between the four repetitions.\n\nPieces that demanded simultaneous execution of versions of the same music, i.e., contrapunctal canons, were written by several composers of the Franco-Flemish school in the late 15th and early 16th century, such as Josquin des Prez, Johannes Ockeghem or Pierre de la Rue. Ockeghem's \"Missa prolationum\" is famous for systematically exploring different ways of combining pairs of voices in mensural canons. In the example given below, from the first \"Kyrie\" of this mass, both upper voices sing the same notated line, one reading it as \"tempus imperfectum\" and the other as \"tempus perfectum\". The two lower voices are similarly coupled with each other. Each of the four voices thus starts the piece in a different mensuration, leading to different bar length in the modern transcription. (The lower voices, which are written in prolatio maior, later shift to a meter where all semibreves are imperfected through black coloration, which means they end up having the same length as those of the upper voices after all.)\n\nWhereas the rules of notating rhythm in Mensural notation were in many ways different from the modern system, the notation of pitch already followed much the same principles. Notes were written on staves of five (sometimes six) lines, prefixed with clefs, and could be altered by accidentals.\n\nMensural notation generally uses C and F clefs, on various lines. G-clefs, while used infrequently throughout the period, did not come into completely routine use until the later 16th century. Clefs were generally chosen to match the vocal range of a given voice, so as to avoid the need of ledger lines. Since middle C lies within that range for most voices, the C-clef is the one most frequently used. For mixed voices, a typical combination of clefs would have the bass clef (F on the fourth staff line) in the lowest voice, and tenor clef, alto clef and soprano clef (middle C on the fourth, third, and first staff line respectively) in the remaining voices. An alternative arrangement, known as \"chiavette\", had the range of each voice shifted one third up, leading to a combination of F, C, C and G clefs.\n\nClefs originally bore shapes more or less closely resembling the letter they represented, but came to develop more ornamental shapes over time. In the F-clef, the two arms of the \"F\" were changed into two dots sitting to the right of a vertical stem. All three elements could be further modified; in particular, they were often styled as if they were note heads. The C-clef remained a simple, often square, \"C\"-like shape in most manuscripts, but its arms tended to become hollow rectangles or rhomboids in later manuscripts and especially in music prints of the 16th century. The G-clef developed a curved ornamental swash typically attached to the top of the letter, which ultimately evolved into the loop shape of the modern form.\n\nThe use of accidentals in medieval and renaissance music differs significantly from modern practice. Medieval notation used two accidental signs, the \"b molle\" () and the \"b durum\" (). While the former was identical in form to the modern flat sign (), the latter could be written in forms that resemble either the modern sharp () or the modern natural (), but these functions were not distinguished from each other as they are today. The \"b molle\" served to pick out the lower of two alternative semitone steps for a given note (e.g., a B as opposed to a B), while the \"b durum\" served to pick out the higher one (e.g., B as opposed to B, but also F as opposed to F, etc.). The meanings of both signs thus overlaps with that of the natural sign today. Until the 16th century, only the flat signs regularly occurred as key signatures at the beginning of a staff (one or at most two flats). Both forms of accidentals could occur as temporary accidentals elsewhere; however, in practice they were often not written but left to the performer to infer according to the rules of counterpoint and musica ficta.\n\nMensural notation may contain a number of other symbols.\n\nThe custos (pl. custodes) appears at the end of the staff on or between the staff lines. It indicates the pitch of the first note that occurs on the following staff that belongs to that part relative to the clef of the current staff. This helps performers to prepare to sing the next note. If the next staff for the part occurs on the following page, two custodes may appear immediately next to each other.\n\nThe corona appears above the last note of the piece (or section). It is similar to the fermata in modern notation. It typically appears above the last note at each part of a piece to indicate the note should be held longer that its value indicates. If it does not appear at the end of a piece, typically a short pause is expected before proceeding with the notes after the note with the corona.\n\nThe signum congruentiae indicates the position of entry of another voice. This is used to denote canons. Instead of writing out all parts, only one part is written out. The signum congruentiae indicates that when the previous part has progressed up to the point where the signum congruentiae appears, the next part should enter (from the start).\n\nThere is some variation in the way signum congruentiae are denoted.\n\nThe most important early stages in the historical development of mensural notation are the works of Franco of Cologne (), Petrus de Cruce (), and Philippe de Vitry (1322). Franco, in his \"Ars cantus mensurabilis\", was the first to describe the relations between maxima, longa and breve in terms that were independent of the fixed patterns of earlier rhythmic modes. He also refined the use of semibreves:, while in earlier music, one breve could occasionally be replaced by two semibreves, Franco described the subdivision of the breve as ternary (perfect), dividing it either into three equal or two unequal semibreves (resulting in predominantly triplet rhythmic micro-patterns.)\n\nPetrus de Cruce introduced subdivisions of the breve into even more short notes. However, he did not yet define these as separate smaller hierarchy levels (minim, semiminim etc.), but simply as variable numbers of semibreves. The exact rhythmic interpretation of these groups is partly uncertain. The technique of notating complex groups of short notes by sequences of multiple semibreves was later used more systematically in the notation of Italian Trecento music.\n\nThe decisive refinements that made notation even of extremely complex rhythmic patterns on multiple hierarchical metric levels possible were introduced in France during the time of the Ars nova, with Philippe de Vitry as the most important theoretician. The Ars nova introduced the shorter note values below the semibreve; it systematicized the relations of perfection and imperfection across all levels, down to the minim, and it introduced the devices of proportions and coloration.\n\nDuring the time of the Franco-Flemish school in Renaissance music, use of the French notation system spread throughout Europe. This period brought the replacement of black with white notation. It also brought a further slowing of the duration of the larger note values, while introducing even more new small ones (fusa, semifusa, etc.). Toward the end of this period, the original rules of perfection and imperfection became obsolescent, as did the use of ligatures. During the 17th century, the system of mensuration signs and proportions gradually developed into the modern time signatures, and new notation devices for time measurements, such as bar lines and ties, were introduced, ultimately leading toward the modern notation system.\n\nToday, music from the mensural period is normally transcribed into modern notation for performance or study, using a modern score layout, bar lines and often a modernized choice of clefs. A number of special editorial conventions for such transcriptions are common, especially in scholarly editions, where it is desirable that the basic characteristics of the original notation should be recoverable from the modern text.\n\nWhile 19th and early 20th century editions of Renaissance music often preserved the large note values of the originals, including breves and longs, most modern editions will use scaled-down note values in order to match modern reading habits regarding tempo and beat structure. For 16th century music, a frequent scheme is diminution by a factor of 2 (i.e., rendering semibreves as modern minims), in a modern \"alla breve\" bar. Older music might be diminished by a factor of 4 (rendering semibreves as crotchets) or sometimes 8 (rendering breves as crotchets). For 13th-century pieces, diminution by 16 (rendering breves as quavers) is also common. For 15th and 16th century music, bar divisions are usually chosen to match the time of a breve, while 14th century Ars nova pieces may be written in measures the length of a longa, and 13th century music in measures the length of a maxima.\n\nTo account for these editorial changes, scholarly editions often print a brief notation fragment in the original form in front of each staff at the beginning of a piece, called an \"incipit\", including the original clefs, mensuration signs, accidentals, and often the first few notes. Alternatively, an annotation defining the mapping scheme may be provided over the staff, e.g., \"=\".\n\nWhere ligatures occur in the original text, this is conventionally marked by square brackets over the transcribed notes, while the use of coloration is sometimes marked by broken brackets (⌜...⌝). Flats or sharps that are not written in the original but suggested by the editor are typically indicated by placing them above the note rather than in front of it.\n\nA special issue in representing Renaissance music is how to deal with its characteristic free-flowing rhythms, where modern bar lines can seem to overly highlight what is part of the natural articulation points of the melodic units. To avoid the excessive use of ties and to allow for a notation more closely reflecting the original, some editions will print bar lines not across the staves, but only in the intermediate spaces between them (a convention sometimes referred to by the German term \"Mensurstrich\"), allowing notes to be read as lasting across a bar line.\n\nFor quoting mensural notation symbols in inline text, a number of characters have been included in the character encoding standard Unicode, in the \"musical symbols\" block. They are located at character codes U+1D1B6 through U+1D1CE.\n\n\n"}

It is also known as the zorro chilote or zorro de Darwin in Spanish and lives on Nahuelbuta National Park (Araucanía Region), the Valdivian Coastal Range (Los Ríos Region) in mainland Chile and Chiloé Island. This small, dark canine weighs , has a head-and-body length of and a tail that is .\n\nDarwin's fox was first collected from San Pedro Island off the coast of Chile by the naturalist Charles Darwin in 1834. It was long held that Darwin's fox was a subspecies of the South American gray fox (\"L. griseus\"); however, the discovery of a small population of Darwin's fox on the mainland in Nahuelbuta National Park in 1990 and subsequent genetic analysis has clarified the fox's status as a unique species. In 2012 and 2013 the presence of the Darwin's fox at Oncol Park, Alerce Costero National Park and the Valdivian Coastal Reserve was confirmed through camera trapping.\n\n\"Pseudalopex\" is a South American genus of canine distantly related to wolves and is technically not a fox. When Charles Darwin collected a specimen from San Pedro Island in Chiloé Archipelago in December 1834 during the \"Beagle\" survey expedition, he observed that this \"fox (of Chiloe, a rare animal) sat on the point & was so absorbed in watching [survey work], that he allowed me to walk behind him & actually kill him with my geological hammer\". In the 1839 publication of his \"Journal and Remarks\", Darwin said \"This fox, more curious or more scientific, but less wise, than the generality of his brethren, is now mounted in the museum of the Zoological Society.\" He said it was \"an undescribed species\", indicating that it was distinct from the species (\"L. culpaeus\" and \"L. griseus\") that occur on the mainland. Later, Darwin's fox was classified as a subspecies (\"Lycalopex griseus fulvipes\") of the latter.\n\nDarwin's fox does not interbreed with the other \"Lycalopex\" species, only lives in forests, and is smaller and darker-colored than the other species. In 1990 a small population of Darwin's fox was found on the mainland in the forested Nahuelbuta National Park, indicating that the fox was not endemic to the island. According to Yahnke et al., in their 1996 article published in the Journal of the Society for Conservation Biology, analysis of mitochondrial DNA of Darwin's fox and the gray fox showed two patterns, indicating Darwin's fox was a new species, closely related to the Sechuran fox. Also according to Yahnke (1995; et al.1996) the present restricted range is a relic of a much wider former range. Zoologists noted the distinctiveness in the ecological niche, appearance, and behavior of this species. Darwin's fox is differentiated from the gray fox in being darker; having shorter legs; a broader, shorter skull; smaller auditory bullae; a more robust dentition; and a different jaw shape and style of premolar occlusion.\n\nIn the late Pleistocene, Chiloé Island was connected to mainland Chile by a land bridge. The land bridge was severed about 15,000 years ago when the sea level rose following the last glaciation. This created two isolated populations of Darwin's fox.\n\nDarwin's fox has a vast diet. In dense forests, where it exists, the foxes hunt for mammals, reptiles, beetles, and invertebrates. Sometimes it selects fruits and berries. Birds and amphibians to a lesser degree are also consumed. It sometimes eats carrion, but it mostly eats live animals and fruit. This makes it mostly an omnivore, sometimes a scavenger.\n\nDarwin's fox is generally believed to be a forest obligate species found only in southern temperate rainforests. They only occur in areas of primary forest on Chiloé and on the mainland. They are most active at twilight and before sunrise. In contrast to other \"Lycalopex\" species, Darwin's fox prefers open spaces. The population of Chiloé has about 200 individuals, and Nahuelbuta on the mainland contains about 50 individuals. The total population size is about 250 mature individuals with at least 90% of the population occurring in one subspopulation (Chiloé Island). Although the species is protected in Nahuelbuta National Park, substantial mortality sources exist when foxes move to lower, unprotected private areas in search of milder conditions during the winter.\n\nThe species was previously cIassified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN, but in 2016 was downlisted to Endangered, as its area occurrences is apparently substantially larger than originally believed. Current estimates of the total population are still low, with an estimated minimum 227 individuals on the mainland and 412 on Chiloé Island. Fragmentation of forest adjacent to the national park and on the island is a concern for their conservation, and feral dogs may pose the greatest threat to their survival by spreading disease or directly attacking. Persecution by people who think that the foxes attack domestic fowls, though they pose little threat, is also a potential problem.\n\n]"}

The Stonewall is a \"system\"; White heads for a very specific pawn formation, rather than trying to memorize long lines of different variations. If White puts up the Stonewall formation it is called \"Stonewall Attack\", regardless of how Black chooses to defend against it. When Black sets up a Stonewall formation, with pawns on c6, d5, e6 and f5, then it is a variation of the Dutch Defense. \"MCO-15\" gives the following as a main line: 1.d4 d5 2.e3 Nf6 3.Bd3 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.f4. \nSince the Stonewall system is used against a variety of Black defenses, the \"Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings\" (\"ECO\") has trouble classifying it. Among the codes used are D00 (when Black has played ...d5), A45, and A03 (the code for Bird's Opening).\n\nThis sample game illustrates what can happen if Black defends poorly.\n\nBibliography\n"}

The book is a first person (and somewhat autobiographical) narrative told from the viewpoint of Israel David Goodkind, the third of the four generations in the book. Goodkind works in a minor bureaucratic post in the White House between March and October 1973; his insignificance gives him time to write his memoirs (the book itself, told as though Goodkind wrote it) while his position gives him opportunities to come face to face with the harried president Richard Nixon. Nixon never is named in the book, but there can be no doubt as to his identity. The narrative refers explicitly to the Watergate scandal, as an event contemporaneous with Goodkind's employment in the White House.\n\nThe story alternates between Goodkind's telling his family history and early years (specifically, his first 26 years (1915–1941)) and his account of current events in 1973, leading up to the Yom Kippur War. The tales of Goodkind's early years describe his family – his mother and father, his sister, his mother's father and father's mother, his mother's half sister, and a tribe of more distant uncles, aunts and cousins (the 'Mishpokha', Yiddish for 'family'). After college, Goodkind works for Harry Goldhandler, a gag writer for radio comedies (very loosely based on David Freedman), and has a romance with showgirl Bobbie Webb. The tales of his present day in 1973 are centered on his wife, his daughter, their friends, and Peter Quat, a college friend who also worked for Goldhandler, and who had become a famous novelist for his sexually explicit characters and unflattering depictions of American Jewish life. Quat's books seem similar to the work of Philip Roth, but Roth did not attend Columbia nor work for Freedman.\n\nAs a young man, Goodkind becomes less observant, but his adult self has returned to the Orthodox practices of his father and grandfather. Goodkind as a child and young man is embarrassed by his first name Israel, mockingly shortened by several other characters to Izzy. In the last scene of the novel when Goodkind returns to the U.S. after the Yom Kippur War, he tells an El Al flight attendant to call him Israel.\n\nAmong the famous people Goodkind comes face to face with in the course of the book besides Nixon are Golda Meir, Zero Mostel, Bert Lahr, Marlene Dietrich, John Barrymore, Ernest Hemingway, Leslie Howard, and the brothers George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin. Goodkind visits Israel during the Yom Kippur War, carries a secret letter from Golda Meir to Richard Nixon, and rides back to Israel with the U.S. Air Force airlift of supplies.\n"}

It was a turbulent period of the composer's life, marked by illness and deaths in his immediate family. In 1937, Stravinsky was diagnosed with tuberculosis, which had already forced his wife and two daughters to a sanatorium in Switzerland. Stravinsky's daughter Ludmilla and wife Catherine died of their illnesses in November 1938 and March 1939, respectively, followed by Stravinsky's own quarantine and the death of his mother Anna in June 1939. He also suffered a cerebral thrombosis while conducting the symphony at a 1956 concert in Berlin, Germany.\n\nStravinsky was still mourning the deaths of his family members when World War II forced him to leave Europe. He had written the symphony's first two movements in France and Switzerland. Stravinsky wrote the third movement in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the fourth movement in Hollywood, after his emigration to the United States. The symphony was premiered by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Stravinsky on November 7, 1940.\n\nThe Symphony in C is representative of Stravinsky's neoclassical period, which had been launched by his ballet \"Pulcinella\" (1919–20), the opera \"Mavra\" (1921–22), and Octet for winds (1922–23). The symphony has a traditional, four-movement structure and lasts approximately 30 minutes:\n\nThe Symphony in C is entirely abstract and seems a retreat into the \"pure music\" styles of Bach, Beethoven, and Haydn. Stravinsky disclaimed any link between his personal experiences and the symphony's content.\n\nRegarding its style, Stravinsky acknowledged a division of the symphony into halves. The first two movements, composed in Europe, use more traditional rhythmic patterns and harmonizations. The last two movements use frequent modulations of rhythm and are much more chromatic.\n\nStravinsky's misfortunes apart, the Symphony in C had been infrequently performed in the composer's lifetime; Stravinsky noted that for several years he was the only person conducting the work.\n\nThe work was choreographed by Martha Graham in the late 1980s. She named the result \"Persephone\" in ironic reference to another major work by Stravinsky. Although Graham choreographed all four movements, only the three-movement version was performed on stage.\n"}

{"id": "2008633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008633", "title": "Ansys", "text": "Ansys\n\nAnsys, Inc. is a global public company based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. It develops and markets multiphysics engineering simulation software for product design, testing and operation. Ansys was founded in 1970 by John Swanson. Swanson sold his interest in the company to venture capitalists in 1993. Ansys went public on NASDAQ in 1996. In the 2000s, Ansys made numerous acquisitions of other engineering design companies, acquiring additional technology for fluid dynamics, electronics design, and other physics analysis. Ansys became a component of the NASDAQ-100 index on December 23, 2019.\n\nThe idea for Ansys was first conceived by John Swanson while working at the Westinghouse Astronuclear Laboratory in the 1960s. At the time, engineers performed finite element analysis (FEA) by hand. Westinghouse rejected Swanson's idea to automate FEA by developing general purpose engineering software, so Swanson left the company in 1969 to develop the software on his own. He founded Ansys under the name Swanson Analysis Systems Inc. (SASI) the next year, working out of his farmhouse in Pittsburgh.\n\nSwanson developed the initial Ansys software on punch-cards and used a mainframe computer that was rented by the hour. Westinghouse hired Swanson as a consultant, under the condition that any code he developed for Westinghouse could also be included in the Ansys product line. Westinghouse also became the first Ansys user.\n\nBy 1991 SASI had 153 employees and $29 million in annual revenue, controlling 10 percent of the market for finite element analysis software. According to \"The Engineering Design Revolution\", the company became \"well-respected\" among engineering circles, but remained small. In 1992, SASI acquired Compuflo, which marketed and developed fluid dynamics analysis software.\n\nIn 1993, Mr. Swanson sold his majority interest in the company to venture capitalist firm TA Associates. Peter Smith was appointed CEO and SASI was renamed after the software, Ansys, the following year. Ansys went public in 1996, raising about $46 million in an initial public offering. By 1997, Ansys had grown to $50.5 million in annual revenue. In the late 1990s, Ansys shifted its business model. It focused less on selling software licenses and corresponding revenue declined. However, revenue from services increased more dramatically. From 1996 to 1999, profits at Ansys grew an average of 160 percent per year.\n\nIn February 2000, Jim Cashman was appointed CEO. Current CEO Ajei S. Gopal was appointed in early 2017.\n\nAnsys develops and markets engineering simulation software for use across the product life cycle. Ansys Mechanical finite element analysis software is used to simulate computer models of structures, electronics, or machine components for analyzing strength, toughness, elasticity, temperature distribution, electromagnetism, fluid flow, and other attributes. Ansys is used to determine how a product will function with different specifications, without building test products or conducting crash tests. For example, Ansys software may simulate how a bridge will hold up after years of traffic, how to best process salmon in a cannery to reduce waste, or how to design a slide that uses less material without sacrificing safety.\n\nMost Ansys simulations are performed using the Ansys Workbench system, which is one of the company's main products. Typically Ansys users break down larger structures into small components that are each modeled and tested individually. A user may start by defining the dimensions of an object, and then adding weight, pressure, temperature and other physical properties. Finally, the Ansys software simulates and analyzes movement, fatigue, fractures, fluid flow, temperature distribution, electromagnetic efficiency and other effects over time.\n\nAnsys also develops software for data management and backup, academic research and teaching. Ansys software is sold on an annual subscription basis. \n\nThe first commercial version of Ansys software was labeled version 2.0 and released in 1971. At the time, the software was made up of boxes of punch cards, and the program was typically run overnight to get results the following morning. In 1975, non-linear and thermo-electric features were added. The software was exclusively used on mainframes, until version 3.0 (the second release) was introduced for the VAXstation in 1979. Version 3 had a command line interface like DOS.\n\nIn 1980, Apple II was released, allowing Ansys to convert to a graphical user interface in version 4 later that year. Version 4 of the Ansys software was easier to use and added features to simulate electromagnetism. In 1989, Ansys began working with Compuflo. Compuflo's Flotran fluid dynamics software was integrated into Ansys by version 5, which was released in 1993. Performance improvements in version 5.1 shortened processing time two to four-fold, and was followed by a series of performance improvements to keep pace with advancements in computing. Ansys also began integrating its software with CAD software, such as Autodesk.\n\nIn 1996, Ansys released the DesignSpace structural analysis software, the LS-DYNA crash and drop test simulation product, and the Ansys Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulator. Ansys also added parallel processing support for PCs with multiple processors. The educational product Ansys/ed was introduced in 1998. Version 6.0 of the main Ansys product was released in December 2001. Version 6.0 made large-scale modeling practical for the first time, but many users were frustrated by a new blue user interface. The interface was redone a few months later in 6.1. Version 8.0 introduced the Ansys multi-field solver, which allows users to simulate how multiple physics problems would interact with one another.\n\nVersion 8.0 was published in 2005 and introduced Ansys' fluid–structure interaction software, which simulates the effect structures and fluids have on one another. Ansys also released its Probabilistic Design System and DesignXplorer software products, which both deal with probabilities and randomness of physical elements. In 2009 version 12 was released with an overhauled second version of Workbench. Ansys also began increasingly consolidating features into the Workbench software.\n\nVersion 15 of Ansys was released in 2014. It added a new features for composites, bolted connections, and better mesh tools. In February 2015, version 16 introduced the AIM physics engine and Electronics Desktop, which is for semiconductor design. The following year, version 17 introduced a new user interface and performance improvement for computing fluid dynamics problems. In January 2017, Ansys released version 18. Version 18 allowed users to collect real-world data from products and then incorporate that data into future simulations. The Ansys Application Builder, which allows engineers to build, use, and sell custom engineering tools, was also introduced with version 18.\n\nReleased in January 2020, Ansys R1 2020 updates Ansys’ simulation process and data management (SPDM), materials information and electromagnetics product offerings. In early 2020, the Ansys Academic Program surpassed one million student downloads.\n\n"}

For centuries, a peace treaty between the Black World and the world of humans has been maintained to ensure relative harmony. Both sides of the continuum are protected by an organization of secret agents called the Black Guard, specifically from a group of radicalized members of the Black World.\n\nRenzaburō Taki, a salaryman electronics salesman by day, and a Black Guard when needed, has casual sex with Kanako, a young woman who he has been meeting at a local bar for three months. Kanako reveals herself to be a spider-like doppelgänger from the Black World Radicals and escapes with a sample of Taki's semen. The next day, Taki is assigned to protect Giuseppe Mayart, a comical and perverted two-hundred-year-old mystic who is a signatory for a ratified treaty between the Human World and the Black World in Tokyo, and a target for the Radicals. Taki is also informed that he will be working with a partner: a Black Guard from the Black World.\n\nWhile awaiting Mayart's arrival at Narita, Taki is attacked by two Radicals at the runway, but is saved by his partner—a beautiful fashion model named Makie. Taki and Makie eventually meet Mayart; the trio take shelter in a Hibiya hotel with spiritual barriers to protect it from Radicals. While playing chess to pass time, the hotelier explains to Taki, who is unsure of his responsibilities within the Black Guard, that he will only value his position once he knows what he is protecting. During an assault on the hotel by a Radical, Mayart sneaks out.\n\nMakie and Taki find him in a soapland in the grip of a Radical who has sapped his health, prompting a frantic trip to a spiritual hospital under Black Guard protection. Halfway there, Makie is taken prisoner by a tentacle demon, and Taki is forced to leave her behind. Upon their arrival at the clinic, Mayart begins his recovery, while Mr. Shadow—the leader of the Radicals—uses a psychic projection to taunt Taki into rescuing Makie. Ignoring Mayart's threats that he will be fired, he pursues Shadow to a dilapidated building far from the hospital, where he finds Makie being gang raped by Radicals. A female Radical attempts to seduce Taki, asking him if he ever copulated with Makie, but he kills her and the Radicals violating Makie, and wounds Shadow.\n\nWhile tending to each other, Makie reveals to Taki that she was once romantically involved with a member of the Radicals, and that she joined the Black Guard because of her belief in the need for peace between the two worlds. Upon returning to the clinic, the pair are fired by Taki's superior, who deems Taki's desires a liability to his duties. While driving through a tunnel with a stowaway Mayart, they are ensnared by Kanako, who—having determined that Taki and Makie were partnered for genetic reasons—attempts to kill them again. Bolts of supernatural lightning kill Kanako, while Taki and Makie are wounded. They later awaken inside a church, and engage in passionate lovemaking.\n\nA final attack by Shadow comes against Taki and Makie, which is deflected by more lighting generated by a surprisingly healthy Mayart, who reveals that he was actually hired to protect his \"bodyguards\". Mayart and Taki almost succeed in defeating Shadow, but the final blow comes from Makie, whose powers have increased due to her being impregnated by Taki. Mayart explains that the two are essential to the new peace treaty; Taki and Makie were selected to be the first couple from both worlds that can produce half-human, half-demon children, and their bond will be instrumental in ensuring everlasting peace between the two worlds. Although angry with Mayart because they were not informed of the Black Guard's plans, Taki implicitly admits that he has fallen for Makie and, per the hotelier's advice, wants to protect her and their child. The trio leave to attend the peace ceremony. Taki remains in the Black Guard to ensure the protection of both worlds and his loved ones.\n\nYoshiaki Kawajiri had just completed his work directing \"The Running Man\", a segment from the portmanteau film \"Neo-Tokyo\" (1987), and was asked to direct a 35-minute OVA short film based on Hideyuki Kikuchi's novel. Writing under the pseudonym \"Kisei Chō\", Norio Osada's original draft of the screenplay began with Makie's saving of Taki from two demons at Narita, and ended with Taki's first battle with Mr. Shadow and rescue of Makie. After Japan Home Video were shown the first 15 minutes of completed animation, they were impressed enough with Kawajiri's work that the runtime was extended to 80 minutes. Kawajiri saw this as an opportunity to explore more characterization and created more animation for the start, the middle and the end. The project was completed in under a year.\n\nAlthough classified as OVA by JHV, it was released in Japanese theaters on April 19, 1987 and received a western release dubbed by Streamline Pictures under the name Wicked City on August 20, 1993. After Streamline Pictures lost the distribution rights, it was licensed and distributed by Urban Vision. A censored version of the film was distributed by Manga Entertainment in the UK with a different dub. Both the Streamline and Manga UK dubs were released in Australia, with the Manga UK dub being released on VHS in 1994. In 1995, Manga Video released in Australia a bundle VHS consisting of \"Wicked City\" and \"Monster City\", this version containing the Streamline dub. In 1997 when Madman Entertainment was named distributor for Manga in Australia, the Streamline dub was released on a single tape, and the Manga UK version was phased out. On July 26, 2015, Discotek Media announced at their Otakon panel that they have acquired the movie and re-released the movie on DVD in 2016 with a new video transfer and with both Streamline and Manga UK English dubs. On September 28, 2018, Toei announced a Region 2 Blu-ray release of the OVA to be released on January 9, 2019.\n\nCharles Solomon of the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated that the film epitomizes the \"sadistic, misogynistic erotica\" popular in Japan. He noted that Yoshiaki Kawajiri composes scenes like a live-action filmmaker, and complimented his deft cutting and camera angles, but felt that the \"Saturday-morning style animation\" and juvenile story did not warrant the effort. Solomon also opined that Kisei Choo's screenplay was inscrutable. Solomon concluded his review by touching upon the belief that there is a connection between screen violence and real-life violence by pointing out that Japan is one of the least violent societies in the industrialized world.\n\nDesson Howe of \"The Washington Post\", who observed the level of violence toward females in the film, characterized it as a \"post-Chandler, quasi-cyberpunky violence fest\". Howe found the film compelling for its \"gymnastic \"camera angles, its kinetic pace and imaginative (if slightly twisted) images.\" He also found the English dubbing laughable, though he saw ominous subtext in various bits of dialogue and other moments in the film.\n\nRichard Harrigton, also of \"The Washington Post\", saw the film as an attempt to create the \"Blade Runner\" of Japanese animation, citing its distinctively languid pace, linear storytelling and gradual exposition. Harrington also detected a \"Brave New World\" subtext, and calling it \"stylish and erotic, exciting in its limited confrontations and provocative in its ambition.\"\n\nMarc Savlov of \"The Austin Chronicle\" gave the film two and a half out of five stars, calling it a \"better-than-average\" treatment of the \"demons from an alternate universe\" subject matter. Savlov stated that the film was easier to follow than \"Urotsukidōji: Legend of the Overfiend\", due to \"Wicked City\" more linear and rapid storyline, and the lack of flashbacks and cyberpunk jargon that Savlov disliked in the genre. Savlov also appreciated the clarified animation. Savlov commented, \"This may not be the second coming of \"Akira\", but it's a step in the right direction.\"\n\nBob Strauss from \"Animation Magazine\" described it as \"one of the strongest features to come out of Japan’s anime\", presenting a seemingly incoherent scenario that \"makes more sense as it climaxes, revealing a few solid, thematic reasons for what initially seemed to be inexplicable behavior, gratuitous sex and reckless sci-fi gimmickry.\" He added that there was also a \"neat moral and spiritual subtext to the whole bizarre enterprise.\"\n\nChuck Arrington of DVD Talk, reviewing the DVD of the film, recommended that consumers \"skip it\", citing the transfer errors and scratches on the print, the at-times washed-out colors, and the uninteresting lengthy interview among the DVD's extras. Arrington thought that the visuals and the fight scenes were generally done well, and that the dubbing into English was acceptable, though exhibited some \"wooden elements\" endemic to all anime titles. Regarding the sexual violence in the film, Arrington found it excluded recommendation for most viewers, commenting, \"Though not nearly as gruesome as \"Legend of the Overfiend\", \"Wicked City\" is definitely not for children and not really for adults either.\"\n\nTheron Martin of \"Anime News Network\" said that \"in all, \"Wicked City\" isn't great fare, but if explicit, sexually-charged supernatural action stories appeal to you then it should fit the bill quite nicely.\"\n\n\"Wicked City\", a Hong Kong live-action adaptation of the film was made in 1992 produced by Film Workshop Ltd. The film was directed by Tai Kit Mak, produced and written by Tsui Hark, and starred Jacky Cheung, Leon Lai, Michelle Reis, Yuen Woo-ping, Roy Cheung, and Tatsuya Nakadai. (Michelle Reis said that Tsui Hark actually directed many scenes himself.)\n\nThe story takes place in Hong Kong in a conflict between worlds of Humans and \"Rapters\". Special police in the city are investigating a mysterious drug named \"happiness\". Taki, one of the police, meets his old lover Windy, who is a rapter and now mistress of a powerful old rapter named Daishu. Taki and other special police track down and fight Daishu, but later find that he hopes to coexist with human. The son of Daishu, Shudo, is the mastermind. In the end, Shudo is defeated, but Daishu and Taki's friends die too. Windy leaves alone.\n\n"}

Unfortunately, now that Billy has been seen doing the routine on TV, Dave can never perform it again, since people will think Dave stole it from Billy.\n\nWhile driving away from the TV studio, Billy is ambushed by Dave who threatens him with a pistol. Dave attempts to get money from Billy to make up for stealing his act but is distracted when Billy drives his car erratically. The car crashes as Billy attempts to wrest the gun away and both men are killed.\n\nBilly finds himself in the afterlife which resembles the backstage area of an extremely sleazy nightclub. His agent Max explains that he must audition on stage and that his performance will determine whether he goes to heaven or hell. A stage manager pushes him onto a stage in front of a bored-looking audience. When Billy tells conventional jokes the audience grows hostile and they taunt him. In order to make the audience laugh, Billy humiliates himself by recounting all the most shameful and degrading incidents of his life, which produces laughter from the audience. As he escapes the stage at the end of the set, he is traumatized by what he has had to reveal and is told that his act is a massive hit. As such, he must spend an eternity exposing his shameful acts forever.\n\nThis provided the inspiration for the episode \"The Comedian\" in the 2019 series.\n\n"}

It is the most north-westerly community in the European Union. Its most northerly point is the Butt of Lewis. The name Ness derives from the old Norse for \"headland\" and many of the other place names in the area also have a Norse origin.\nNess is part of the Galson Estate which is owned by Urras Oighreachd Ghabhsainn (Galson Estate Trust) which is managed by 10 local trustees elected by the community. The hand-over took place on 12 January 2007.\n\nNess is accessible via the A857 road and is about by road from Stornoway. You can also reach Ness by walking across the moor from North Tolsta in Back to Skigersta. It is about and takes 6 hours at a leisurely pace.\n\nScottish Gaelic is the language of the community with 75% being able to speak it. Peat cut from the moor, is used as a fuel for cooking and heating in many homes, but its use is on the decline. The 2001 Census results show a resident population of just under 1,000. In 1831 Ness had a population of just over 3,000.\n\nLandmarks include the 13th-century Teampull Mholuaidh in Eoropie and the small island of Dùn Èistean which is the ancestral home of the Lewis Morrisons of the Clan Morrison. There is a road sign to the bridge across to Dùn Èistean, and archaeological excavations have been taking place there. Morrisons of Harris and Lewis can traditionally be found around Nis, and in the north-west Highlands in the county of Sutherland around the town of Durness (Scottish Gaelic: Diùranais).\n\nEach year 10 men from Ness go out to the island of Sula Sgeir in late August for two weeks to harvest around 2,000 young gannets known locally as Guga. The Guga hunt is a Ness tradition and the bird considered a delicacy.\n\nA Ness boat builder called John F. Macleod from Port saved 40 lives following the sinking of the Iolaire by managing to take a line to shore.\n\nNess is known for its Sgoth, a type of clinker built skiff with a dipping lug sail. The boats were used for line fishing until the early half of the twentieth century. There are several still in active use owned by community trusts which maintain them.\n\nLionel School is the school providing for Ness. Lionel School prides itself on its sporting prowess and pupils have won trophies for football, running, badminton and swimming. The school roll is 116.\n\nThe small School at Cross closed in 2011 due to falling rolls, latterly having only 19 pupils. The buildings have now been taken over by Comunn Eachdraidh Nis, the Ness Historical Society.\n\nFootball is the main sport with Ness FC playing their home matches on Fivepenny Machair. 'Spors Nis' is a new (2007) Community Sports Centre with all the modern facilities you would expect including a two lane 10 pin bowling alley. Lionel School also has a swimming pool which is open to the public when not in use by the school.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2008686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008686", "title": "Poikilotherm", "text": "Poikilotherm\n\nA poikilotherm () is an animal whose internal temperature varies considerably. It is the opposite of a homeotherm, an animal which maintains thermal homeostasis. While the term in principle can apply to all organisms, it is generally only applied to animals, and mostly to vertebrates. Usually the fluctuations are consequence of variation in the ambient environmental temperature. Many terrestrial ectotherms are poikilothermic. However some ectotherms remain in temperature-constant environments to the point that they are actually able to maintain a constant internal temperature (i.e. are homeothermic). It is this distinction that often makes the term \"poikilotherm\" more useful than the vernacular \"cold-blooded\", which is sometimes used to refer to ectotherms more generally.\n\nPoikilothermic animals include types of vertebrate animals, specifically some fish, amphibians, and reptiles, as well as many invertebrate animals. The naked mole-rat and sloth are some of the rare mammals which are poikilothermic.\n\nThe term derives from Greek \"poikilos\" (), meaning \"varied,\" ultimately from a root meaning \"dappled\" or “painted,” and \"thermos\" (), meaning \"heat\".\n\nPoikilotherm animals must be able to function over a wider range of temperatures than homeotherms. The speed of most chemical reactions vary with temperature, and in order to function poikilotherms may have four to ten enzyme systems that operate at different temperatures for an important chemical reaction. As a result, poikilotherms often have larger, more complex genomes than homeotherms in the same ecological niche. Frogs are a notable example of this effect, though their complex development is also an important factor in their large genome.\n\nBecause their metabolism is variable and generally below that of homeothermic animals, sustained high-energy activities like powered flight in large animals or maintaining a large brain is generally beyond poikilotherm animals. The metabolism of poikilotherms favors strategies such as sit-and-wait hunting over chasing prey for larger animals with high movement cost. As they do not use their metabolisms to heat or cool themselves, total energy requirement over time is low. For the same body weight, poikilotherms need only 5 to 10% of the energy of homeotherms.\n\n\nIt is comparatively easy for a poikilotherm to accumulate enough energy to reproduce. Poikilotherms at the same trophic level often have much shorter generations than homeotherms: weeks rather than years. Such applies even to animals with similar ecological roles such as cats and snakes.\n\nThis difference in energy requirement also means that a given food source can support a greater density of poikilothermic animals than homeothermic animals. This is reflected in the predator-prey ratio which is usually higher in poikilothermic fauna compared to homeothermic ones. However, when homeotherms and poikilotherms have similar niches, and compete, the homeotherm can often drive poikilothermic competitors to extinction, because homeotherms can gather food for a greater fraction of each day.\n\nIn medicine, loss of normal thermoregulation in humans is referred to as \"poikilothermia\". This is usually seen with sedative and hypnotic drugs or in 'compartment syndrome'. For example, barbiturates, ethanol, and chloral hydrate may precipitate this effect. REM sleep is also considered a poikilothermic state in humans.\n"}

The term is often used as an adjective when referring to the portico of a classical building, which projects from the main structure. First used in Etruscan and Greek temples, this motif was later incorporated by the Romans into their temples.\n\nExamples of prostyle include the Temple of Athena Nike, Akropolis, Athens, a prostyle tetrastyle (i.e. with four columns). There are also prostyle hexastyle and prostyle octastyle temples.\n\nThis architectural element probably originated in the eastern Greek isles in the 8th century BCE, but there are also many examples in archaic temples in southern Italy.\n\nThe subsequent evolution of temple design came with the amphiprostyle, where there are rows of columns both in front and at the back of the temple.\n"}

In so doing, the chain bridge also spans the border between England and Scotland. When it opened in 1820 it was the longest wrought iron suspension bridge in the world with a span of , and the first vehicular bridge of its type in the United Kingdom. Although work started on the Menai Suspension Bridge first, the Union Bridge was completed earlier. Today it is the oldest suspension bridge still carrying road traffic and is a Category A listed building in Scotland and a Grade I listed building in England. It lies on Sustrans Route 1 and the Pennine Cycleway.\n\nBefore the opening of the Union Bridge, crossing the river at this point involved an round trip via Berwick-upon-Tweed downstream or a trip via Coldstream upstream. (Ladykirk and Norham Bridge did not open until 1888.)\n\nThe bridge was designed by an English Royal Navy officer, Captain Samuel Brown. Brown joined the Navy in 1795, and seeing the need for an improvement on the hemp ropes used, which frequently failed with resulting loss to shipping, he employed blacksmiths to create experimental wrought iron chains. was fitted with iron rigging in 1806, and in a test voyage proved successful enough that in 1808, with his cousin Samuel Lenox, he set up a company that would become Brown Lenox & Co. Brown left the Navy in 1812, and in 1813 he built a prototype suspension bridge of span, using of iron. It was sufficiently strong to support a carriage, and John Rennie and Thomas Telford reported favourably upon it.\n\nBrown took out a patent in 1816 for a method of manufacturing chains, followed by a patent titled \"Construction of a Bridge by the Formation and Uniting of its Component Parts\" in July 1817. In around 1817, Brown proposed a span bridge over the River Mersey at Runcorn, but this bridge was not built. It is not known why Brown became involved with the Union Bridge project, but agreed to take on the work based on a specification dated September 1818.\n\nBrown knew little of masonry, and Rennie did this aspect of the work.\n\nThe bridge proposal received consent in July 1819, with the authority of an Act of Parliament that had been passed in 1802, and construction began on 2 August 1819.\n\nIt opened on 26 July the following year, with an opening ceremony attended by the celebrated Scottish civil engineer Robert Stevenson among others. Captain Brown tested the bridge in a curricle towing twelve carts, before a crowd of about 700 spectators crossed. Until 1885, tolls were charged for crossing the bridge; the toll cottage, being at the English end, was demolished in 1955.\n\nWith the abolition of turnpike tolls in 1883, maintenance of the bridge passed to the Tweed Bridges Trust. When the Trust was wound up, the bridge became the responsibility of Scottish Borders Council and Northumberland County Council and it is now maintained by the County Council.\n\nIn addition to the 1902 addition of cables, the bridge has been strengthened and refurbished on many occasions. The bridge deck was substantially renewed in 1871, and again in 1974, with the chains reinforced at intervals throughout its life.\n\nThe bridge was closed to motor vehicles for several months during 2007. A newspaper report available online (see external links) indicates that the closure happened shortly before 12 April 2007 and was due to one of the bridge hangers breaking. The affected hanger has temporarily been replaced with a threaded bar to allow the bridge to reopen to motor vehicles.\n\nIn December 2008 the bridge was closed to traffic as a result of a landslide. In March 2013 the media reported a proposal to close the bridge because of a lack of funds to maintain it.\nIn October 2014, it was reported that local enthusiasts and activists had started a campaign to have the bridge fully restored in time for its bicentenary in 2020.\n\nIn 2013, the bridge was placed on Historic England's Heritage at Risk register.\n\nIn August 2017, Scottish Borders Council agreed to contribute £1 million towards a proposed £7.8 million upgrade of the bridge. A further £3.14 million was secured from the National Lottery Heritage Fund in September 2019. Matched funding from Scottish Borders Council and Northumberland County Council meant the project could go ahead. Work is due to start in February 2020. The bridge will be closed from then until April 2021.\n\nThe bridge has a single span of .\n\nIt runs on an east-west alignment, with the western end in Scotland and the eastern end in England.

Its extremely rich iconography and its visual components rank it among the most precious illuminated manuscripts of the second half of the 11th century in Europe. It was probably made at the order of Czech diplomats to honour an anniversary of the Czech King Vratislav's coronation which took place in 1085 (Vratislav was the first king of Bohemia, which was previously a dukedom). The codex is of Danubian provenance, and closely related to three other surviving manuscripts – two of them now in Poland and one in the Prague Chapter Library. They probably originated in the circle of the scriptorium at the Monastery of St. Emmeram in Regensburg. The manuscript is now located in the Czech National Library, Prague under the signature XIV A 13. In 2005 it was declared as a National cultural monument of the Czech Republic.\n\nThe earliest known representation of the \"Tree of Jesse\" is in the book.\nIn a paper analysing this image, J.A. Hayes Williams points out that the iconography employed is very different from that usually found in such images, which she argues relates to an assertion of the rightful kingship of the royal patron. The page showing the \"Jesse Tree\" is accompanied by a number of other illuminated pages of which four depict the Ancestors of Christ. The \"Jesse Tree\" has not been used to support a number of figures, as is usual. Instead, the passage from Isaiah has been depicted in a very literal way. In the picture, the prophet Isaiah approaches Jesse from beneath whose feet is springing a tree, and wraps around him a banner with words upon it which translate literally as: \"A little rod from Jesse gives rise to a splendid flower\", following the language of the Vulgate.

The score was revised in 1949.\n\nStravinsky designed the Capriccio to be a virtuosic vehicle which would allow him to earn a living from playing the piano part. The Capriccio, together with the Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments, belonged to a catalogue of breadwinning pieces which Stravinsky composed to support himself after fleeing the Russian Revolution to live in Western Europe.\n\nThe Allegro capriccioso movement that would become the finale was begun first, in Nice on Christmas Day 1928, and provided the musical material from which the other movements grew. It was followed by the second movement, completed at Echarvines on 13 September 1929, and then by the opening Presto. The orchestration of the first movement was completed on 26 October and that of the last movement on 9 November 1929 .\n\nThe premiere took place in the Salle Pleyel, Paris, on 6 December 1929, with the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris conducted by Ernest Ansermet (who had founded the orchestra that winter season) and featuring the composer at the piano . The next year, Stravinsky made a commercial recording of the work as soloist, with the Straram Orchestra, conducted by Ernest Ansermet . Beginning in the mind-1930s, Stravinsky's son Soulima often performed as soloist, most often with his father conducting .\n\nIn 1949 Stravinsky corrected a number of misprints and omissions in the score, and this version was published in 1952. Unfortunately, a few new mistakes were added in this new edition, the most important of which was a change of the tempo marking at rehearsal number 14 from the original dotted-quaver = 88 to 80, which contradicts the specification that the semiquavers remain the same .\n\nAmongst other influences on the Capriccio, Stravinsky very much had in mind Carl Maria von Weber, whom he described as \"a prince of music\" .\n\nThe three movements are played \"attacca\" (without interruption) and take just under twenty minutes to perform.\nThe Capriccio is scored for solo piano, pairs of woodwinds (flutes doubling piccolo, oboes, clarinets doubling piccolo clarinet, and bassoons), cor anglais, four horns, three trombones, tuba, strings and timpani.\n\nIn addition to the solo piano, there is a concertino group of soloists consisting of the first violinist, first violist, first cellist and first bassist.\n\nThe score was first used as ballet music when Léonide Massine choreographed it in 1947 for the Teatro alla Scala, Milan. The décor for this production was by Nicola Benois. A second production was created in 1957 with choreography, décor, and costumes by Alan Carter . \nThe original 1929 version of the Capriccio was used by George Balanchine as the score for the \"Rubies\" section of his full-length 1967 ballet \"Jewels\" .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2008726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008726", "title": "Abusir", "text": "Abusir\n\nAbusir (  ; Egyptian \"pr wsjr\"; \"\", \"the House or Temple of Osiris\"; ) is the name given to an Egyptian archaeological locality – specifically, an extensive necropolis of the Old Kingdom period, together with later additions – in the vicinity of the modern capital Cairo. The name is also that of a neighbouring village in the Nile Valley, whence the site takes its name. Abusir is located several kilometres north of Saqqara and, like it, served as one of the main elite cemeteries for the ancient Egyptian capital city of Memphis. Several other villages in northern and southern Egypt are named Abusir or Busiri.\nAbusir is one relatively small segment of the extensive \"pyramid field\" that extends from north of Giza to below Saqqara. The locality of Abusir took its turn as the focus of the prestigious western burial rites operating out of the then-capital of Memphis during the Old Kingdom 5th Dynasty. As an elite cemetery, neighbouring Giza had by then \"filled up\" with the massive pyramids and other monuments of the 4th Dynasty, leading the 5th Dynasty pharaohs to seek sites elsewhere for their own funerary monuments.\n\nAbusir was the origin of the largest find of Old Kingdom papyri to date — the Abusir Papyri. In the late nineteenth century, a number of Western museums acquired collections of fragmentary papyri from the administrative (temple) records of one Abusir funerary cult, that of king Neferirkare Kakai. This discovery was supplemented in the late twentieth century when excavations by a Czech expedition to the site revealed papyri from two other cult complexes, that of the pharaoh Neferefre (also read Raneferef) and for the king's mother Khentkaus II.\n\nThe Czech Institute of Egyptology of the Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague has been conducting excavations at Abusir since 1976. They are presently directed by Miroslav Bárta.\n\nThere are considerable catacombs near the ancient town of Busiris (Pliny xxxvi. 12. s. 16). To the south of Busiris one great cemetery appears to have stretched over the plain. The Heptanomite Busiris was in fact a hamlet standing at one extremity of the necropolis of Memphis.\n\nThere are a total of 14 pyramids at this site, which served as the main royal necropolis during the Fifth Dynasty. The quality of construction of the Abusir pyramids is inferior to those of the Fourth Dynasty; perhaps signalling a decrease in royal power or a less vibrant economy. They are smaller than their predecessors, and are built of low quality local stone. All of the major pyramids at Abusir were built as step pyramids, although the largest of them — the Pyramid of Neferirkare — is believed to have originally been built as a step pyramid some seventy metres in height and then later transformed into a \"true\" pyramid by having its steps filled in with loose masonry.\n\nThe three major pyramids are \n\n\nThe tombs of several high officials and family members are located in the direct vicinity of their king's pyramid:\n\nDirectly north of Saqqara is a cemetery of lower-ranking officials of the Old Kingdom, including the following tombs:\n\nOn a small hill directly south of the pyramid of Neferefre is a cemetery of tombs from the Saite period:\n\nAlso found at Abusir were substantial remains of a Ramesside temple, perhaps built by Ramses II. The temple lies about 500 meters south east of the pyramids, close to the cultivation in the desert. The main building of the temple was built of limestone. There were three cellars, a small hall with four columns and a courtyard (with mudbrick walls) with ten limestone columns. The limestone building was placed within a larger complex made of mud bricks with a pylon and magazines.\n\nAbusir, Saqqara and Dahshur suffered damage by looters during the 2011 Egyptian protests. Part of the false door from the tomb of the priest Rahotep was stolen, and store rooms were broken into. \n\nSystematic looting continues into 2013 with organized digging and destruction of tombs and mummies.\n\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies it climate as hot desert (BWh), as the rest of Egypt.\n\n\n"}

In 1632 he was made Majordomo and Prefect of the Lateran palace, in which posts he was responsible for supervising church and court ceremonies. On 25 Jul 1633, he was consecrated Titular Archbishop of Amasia \"in partibus\" by Antonio Marcello Barberini (seniore), Cardinal-Priest of Sant'Onofrio, with Giovanni della Robbia, Bishop of Bertinoro, and Benedetto Landi, Bishop Emeritus of Fossombrone, serving as co-consecrators.\n\nAs private secretary to Pope Urban, among his most valuable services was that of purchasing old works of art, or commissioning new works, for that inveterate collector; among the artists he encouraged was Claude Lorrain. He was rewarded toward the end of Urban's pontificate by being raised to the purple as Cardinal-Priest of San Crisogono on 31 August 1643. He was appointed Bishop of Orvieto in 1644.\n\nHe participated in the Papal conclave of 1644 which elected Urban's successor, Pope Innocent X.\n\nThroughout his life, he remained very devoted to his home town and region. In addition to beautifying Usigni, he was instrumental in developing iron mines in the area, and he was also so greatly devoted to Rita of Cascia (beatified by Urban in 1627), adorning her church in that town and promoting her cult, that he is often considered to have been the main force in establishing her present cult and popularity. The second edition (1652) of Girolamo de Ghetti's \"Breve Racconto della Vita e Miracoli della B. Rita da Cascia\" is dedicated to him.\n\nPoli died in Orvieto in 1653; he was buried according to his wishes in the Chapel of the Guardian Angel in his titular church of San Crisogono.\n\n"}

Population: \n\nThe name Berezniki is derived from a birch forest originally situated on the city's location.\n\nIt was founded in 1873. City status was granted to it in 1932 as its industry was rapidly expanding under Joseph Stalin.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of krai significance of Berezniki—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of krai significance of Berezniki is incorporated as Berezniki Urban Okrug.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the city's population dropped due to increased unemployment. Nevertheless, the city was able to keep its main industries on track. Large chemical plants such as titanium and sodium factories as well as several huge Potassium, Magnesium and Potash mines are operational in Berezniki.\n\nThe potash mine, owned by Uralkali, was the basis of the fortune of Dmitry Rybolovlev who sold his interest in 2010 to Suleyman Kerimov. Mine supports in the huge underground mine, about 1,000 feet (~300 metres) beneath the city, consist of soluble salt which is being dissolved by water flooding into the mine. The city, a former Soviet era labor camp, was built near the work site, over the mine. Several sinkholes, some huge, have opened within the city. The situation requires round-the-clock monitoring. The problem is believed to be limited to a small part of the mine which was not filled properly and to be limited in its future impact, but relocation of the city is under consideration. The largest sinkhole, locally dubbed, \"The Grandfather\" by 2012, was 340 yards (~310 metres) wide, 430 yards (~390 metres) long, and 780 feet (~240 metres) deep. When it opened in 2007 the hole was initially 80 m long, 40 m wide and 200 m deep. The sinkhole was expected to expand, and destroy part of the only rail line which leads to and from the potash mines, and, being that Berezniki produces around 10% of the worlds potash, this would lead global demand towards Canada, potentially damaging the local economy. Nobody was injured when the sinkhole appeared.\n\nBerezniki has a theater and a museum of regional history.\n\nEvery year from July 17 to the 20th the town celebrates its mosquitoes. They have music, dancing and a \"most delicious girl\" competition. In the competition, the girls stand for 20 minutes in their shorts and vests, and the one who receives the most bites wins.\n\n\nBerezniki is served by the Berezniki Airport, which mainly serves helicopters. A railway station is closed since it is located in the sinkhole area and has been damaged beyond repair. In the city public transport service is operated with trolleybuses.\n\n\n\n"}

It is mentioned in historical writings as Izyaslavl. The town's current name derives from this name.\n\nIn the early Middle Ages, the town was the centre of the Principality of Izyaslavl. In the 11th century, the town was heavily fortified; much of its territory has been designated an archaeological reservation. There is also a modern outdoor statue of Rogneda and Izyaslav on the grounds.\n\nDuring the period of Reformation, the town was a nest for followers of Calvinism and Socinianism.\n\nThe town became a part of the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire after the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. Soviet power was established in November 1917. German occupation lasted from February to December 1918. In 1919, the town became a part of the Byelorussian SSR. Polish occupation lasted from July 1919 to July 1920.\n\nThis district center was under German occupation from 28 June 1941 to 4 July 1944. In 1939, Jews comprised 9% of the town’s total population, numbering 248 people. \nIn October 1941, the Germans gathered 100 Jews of the city in a ghetto which was a building formerly occupied by Soviet border guards. It was forbidden to go outside, they didn’t received food. The ghetto was surrounded by a fence and was supervised day and night. On September 26 and 27, 1941, all the Jewish males were killed, at least 20 people in total, 12 of them burned in the ghetto building. On September 29, around 100 Jews, mostly women, children, and elderly people, were taken on horse carts out of the ghetto under the pretext of future resettlement to Minsk. They were all shot in a pit in the forest near the village of Sloboda. For a month following the liquidation of the ghetto, 35 Jewish women were kept in one of the houses on Bazarnaya Street. They were used for different kinds of forced labor until they were all shot on October 29, 1941.\n\nSituated in north-western suburb of Minsk, is part of its urban area and one of its main towns also with Fanipol and Machulishi.

It told the story of an alien culture in a manner that contained a blend of science fiction with details of Earth-like ancient civilizations, the most obvious being ancient Rome.\nThe series initially ran from 1965 to 1982, dealing with the long-past events of an empire on the distant planet of Elekton. Heavily influenced by mythological tales, a number of the societies seemed to be based on ancient cultures that had existed in history. Chief among these was the Trigan Empire, apparently modelled on Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. This similarity even extended to Trigan City, the capital being built on five hills, in a similar fashion to the seven hills of Rome. The Trigans flew atmosphere craft. The Trigans' clothing was similar to that of the Romans, with many of the populace dressed in toga-like garments, or in the case of the soldiery, in Greek or Roman-style armour. A similar likeness could be drawn with Hericon, the chief rival in power to the Trigans, whose appearance seemed to mirror that of elements of the Byzantine Empire, and the Persian Empire.\n\nAccording to Butterworth, \"The original Impetus was from that veritable genius Leonard Matthews, then my senior group editor when I was editing \"Sun” and “Comet\". He threw the first introductory script at me and told me to take it from there. He had no idea where to further it but he knew where to look for a guy who did...\"\n\nThe first strip told of a spaceship crashing into a swamp on Earth, the crew frozen to death, with many written volumes inside in an unknown language. Studies of the crew reveal them to be humanoid, but around 12 feet tall. After many years, the spaceship is turned into the central attraction of an amusement park. Eventually, at a very advanced age, a scientist—Peter Richard Haddon—who has studied the books from the spaceship as a young man manages to translate the volumes, and begins to relate the tales.\n\nThe Trigans began as a nomadic tribe called the Vorgs, with no technology, initially under the leadership of three brothers, Trigo, Brag and Klud. Trigo persuades his more conservative brothers that in the face of changing events, namely the ambitions of the Lokan Empire, they must settle. The fledgling Trigan nation is established via a merger of the nomadic Vorgs and the technically advanced people of Tharv (who arrived as refugees to the Plains of Vorg after they were defeated by the Lokans) under the leadership of Trigo, with the trappings of a Romanesque civilization with swords, lances and Roman-style clothing, but with high-tech ray guns, aircraft and a high-tech navy. In a later story, the Trigans create a rocketship in months to fly to one of Elekton's moons. Several of the other civilizations show a similar blend of low and high tech.\n\nThe strip first appeared in the first issue of the British magazine \"Ranger\" in September 1965 and then in the British \"Look and Learn\" magazine from issue 232 (June 1966) when the two titles merged after the 40th issue of \"Ranger\". Both titles were weekly educational magazines designed for children; although mainly filled with educational features on life, history, science and technology, both contained a small comic strip section in each issue. Unusually for a British comic, the strip was printed in colour.\n\nThe series ran in \"Look and Learn\" until the title ceased publication with issue 1049, in April 1982, comprising a run of 854 issues in total, divided between the two magazines.\n\nIn addition to the weekly strips, a very small number of Trigan Empire stories were published in \"Ranger\" annuals and a \"Vulcan\" summer special.\n\nIn 1975-1976, the series thus far was reprinted in its original sequential order, in \"Vulcan\", a weekly glossy-format comic, which reprinted the strips in full colour, albeit edited and resized, alongside colour reprints of other British comics serials of the 1960s.\n\nThere were a number of reprints in hardback format. In 1978, Hamlyn Publishing in the United Kingdom printed a hardback collection of early Trigan Empire stories titled simply \"The Trigan Empire\"; this was reprinted in the United States by Chartwell Publishing. A later collection, also in hardback, was printed by Hawk Publishing in 1989 as \"Tales of the Trigan Empire\". Both the Hamlyn and the Hawk books presented edited versions of the stories; most notably, in the Hawk book there are sometimes entire pages that have been left out. Several stories were repeated in both collections, but \"The Trigan Empire\" collection has the earliest, showing the establishment of the Empire.\n\nIn 2004-2008, the stories drawn by Don Lawrence were reprinted by the Don Lawrence Collection in luxury hardback limited editions. These editions contain the complete stories, without any of the omissions that were a feature of the earlier reprints, particularly the Hawk Publishing book. They were not reprinted from \"Look and Learn\"; in many cases they were printed from the original artwork, and used revised fonts to make the text easier to read.\n\nThe rights to \"The Trigan Empire\" were bought by Rebellion Developments in 2018. They intend publishing the sequence drawn by Lawrence in four volumes with a first volume appearing in March 2020.\n\nTrigo - Trigo is the founder of the Empire. With his two brothers Brag and Klud, he was the leader of a tribe of Vorgs. At this time the Lokan Empire was instituting a military buildup with an intent to take over the entire planet. Trigo had a vision of a nation where the Vorg tribesmen could give up their nomadic existence and band together in civilization. He knew that the Lokans were intent on conquest and felt that if the Vorgs were not united they would become extinct. When his initial plans to build a city on the plains of Vorg fail, there is a fateful meeting with refugees from the nation of Tharv which has been attacked by Loka. Among these refugees is the architect Peric who agrees to help Trigo with his plans as long as his people are allowed to stay there. Although Brag was willing to give up his claims of leadership to his people to allow Trigo to become sole ruler, his brother Klud had no such plan and tried to assassinate Trigo. In the years to come, Trigo will institute a treaty with Hericon, the other great power on the planet of Elekton, be crowned first Emperor of the Trigan Empire, and face many other threats to himself and his empire.\n\nBrag - Trigo's brother. While some consider him slow and perhaps a bit stupid, Brag is well-meaning and ever faithful to his brother. Despite living in relative luxury with all the benefits of more advanced technology there are times that Brag wishes he was back to his life as a simple Vorg huntsman. He keeps himself in good physical shape despite growing older. If Brag can be classed as having a fault, it is that he can be manipulated by those cleverer than himself.\n\nJanno - Janno is the son of Brag and nephew to Emperor Trigo. A courageous individual, he has a natural aptitude as an atmosphere craft pilot. He is friends with Keren, the son of Chief Imbala of Daveli, and Roffa from the City State of Ellul. Janno is regularly a representative of Trigan City, whether it is as an athlete in the olympic style games, or as a diplomatic envoy. In some stories it is mentioned in a short dialogue that Trigo had a thought to name him his successor.\n\nPeric - Chief architect of the destroyed nation of Tharv, Peric with his daughter and other Tharvish refugees made their way into the desert of Vorg after the destruction of the main city of Tharv by Lokan forces. Peric is of advanced years but remains fairly healthy. He is regarded as the greatest living architect on Elekton and an accomplished engineer and scientist. He is often behind many of the great accomplishments of the Empire.\n\nSalvia - Salvia is the daughter of Peric and is the most visible female character in the series. Salvia is skilled in Tharvish medicine, a trait that would serve the Empire well on a number of occasions, whether it is saving Trigo from potent poison inflicted by Trigo's brother, or the life of Keren, son of Chief Imbala of Daveli, or the life of the Chieftainess of the Tamaz desert warriors.\n\nKeren - Janno's best friend and son of Chief Imbala of Daveli whose culture closely mirrors that of Central American Indian civilisations. Keren was introduced in the second tale of the series, \"Crash in the Jungle\". Keren and his people are shown as being either blue skinned or dark green, depending on the printing.\n\nLady Ursa - Sister of King Kassar of Hericon and probably the next most visible female character of the series. She and Trigo were married, as guarantee for the ratification of a trade treaty, at the start of the story titled \"War With Hericon\". They would have triple sons, although two would later be killed.\n\nKing Zorth - The autocratic, megalomaniacal, despotic and tyrannical leader of Loka whose obsession with planet conquest (especially that of the Trigan Empire) ended only when he was overthrown by his own people.

The 2004 parish population, including the hamlet of Nounsley, was approximately 5,500. \"Hatfield\" means a 'heathery space in the forest'; \"Peverel\" refers to William Peverel, the Norman knight granted lands in the area by William the Conqueror after the Norman invasion of 1066. Sited on high ground east of the River Ter, between Boreham and Witham on the A12, it is situated in the southern extremity of the Braintree District Council area (to which it elects two members).\n\nHatfield Peverel is 6 miles (10 km) northeast from Chelmsford, the nearest large town, to which it is connected by road and rail. Hatfield Peverel railway station is on the Abellio Greater Anglia East Anglia rail network, connecting it to London and Colchester\n\nHatfield Peverel is the site of a priory founded by the Saxon Ingelrica, wife of Ranulph Peverel and reputed to be the mistress of William the Conqueror, to atone for her sins, and dissolved by Henry VIII. The parish church, St Andrew's (Church of England) is the surviving fragment of the Norman priory church nave. There is also a Methodist Church and a Salvation Army (northeast London headquarters) congregation. The village has a Junior School (St Andrew's C of E) and an adjacent County Infant School, and Scout and Guide organisations with headquarters in Church Road, a Post Office, library, and doctors' surgery. Hatfield Peverel was the site of an Arla Foods factory which closed in July 2016, it used to produce dairy products, and other small business concerns. The factory which has subsequently been demolished and there are plans to build up to 177 houses on the former site. There are six public houses, a farm shop and other retail outlets. Major houses include Berwick Place, Crix, Hatfield Place, Hatfield Wick, and The Priory.\n\nHatfield Peverel Station is seen in the 1976 film \"Exposé\" starring Linda Hayden and Fiona Richmond. The surrounding countryside is also seen.\n\nHatfield Peverel Football Club has been established since 1903. Originally based at the Duke of Wellington Public House before moving to the Recreation Ground in 1936. The club are now based on the outskirts of the village at a former gravel pit at Wickham Bishops Road and fields men's, ladies and junior teams.\n\nHatfield Peverel was the home of Agnes Waterhouse, the first woman to be executed for witchcraft in England. Known locally as Mother Waterhouse, and she confessed to witchcraft in 1566, and two other women were also accused of witchcraft at the same time: Elizabeth Francis and Joan Waterhouse (Agnes' daughter). Her trial took place in Chelmsford, where she was found guilty and executed for using witchcraft to disease and cause the death of William Fynne.\n\nElizabeth admitted to having a familiar - a cat called Satan, who she fed drops of her blood and it helped to kill people, terminate pregnancies and stole cattle. She sold the cat to Agnes in exchange for cake, and both Agnes and Joan tested the cat's abilities. Joan is said to have had the cat turn into a toad, and when a child refused to give Joan food, Satan offered to help Joan in exchange for her soul, which she agreed to. The toad was said to have harassed the child and threatened her with death, and eventually the child asked Satan who its 'dame' was, and it answered Agnes Waterhouse, leading her to be accused of witchcraft by the child.\n\nWaterhouse was executed two days after the trial based on the evidence and word of the child.\n\n"}

{"id": "2008784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008784", "title": "Gilad Atzmon", "text": "Gilad Atzmon\n\nGilad Atzmon (, ; born 9 June 1963) is a British jazz saxophonist, novelist, political activist, and writer. He has been described by scholars and anti-racism activists as antisemitic and a Holocaust denier.\n\nAtzmon was born in a secular Jewish family in Tel Aviv, Israel and grew up in Jerusalem.\n\nAtzmon first became interested in the British variety of jazz when he came across some recordings of it in a British record shop in Jerusalem in the 1970s, and found inspiration in the work of Ronnie Scott and Tubby Hayes and regarded London as \"the Mecca of Jazz.\" However, at 17, while readying himself for induction into the army, he happened to hear a radio broadcast of a recording of Charlie Parker's \"With Strings\" and was swept off his feet. Atzmon has said of the album that he \"loved the way the music is both beautiful and subversive – the way he basks in the strings but also fights against them.\" According to Atzmon, he skipped school to visit Jerusalem's Piccadilly Records outlet, and bought up every Bebop recording they stocked. Two days later, he purchased a saxophone.\n\nAccording to Atzmon, he was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in June 1981, first serving as a combat medic and participated in the 1982 Lebanon War. According to Aztmon, he was transferred to a position within the Israel Defense Forces Orchestra and spent most of his military service in the Israeli Air Force orchestra. After he was demobilised, Atzmon says he travelled to Europe in December 1984, living as a busker.\n\nIn the following years, he trained at the Rubin Academy of Music in Jerusalem. During the late 1980s and 1990s Atzmon was a popular session musician and producer, recording extensively and performing with Israeli artists such as: Yehuda Poliker, Yardena Arazi, Si Himan, Meir Banai and Ofra Haza. Additionally, he started the first incarnation of the \"Gilad Atzmon Quartet\" and a group named \"Spiel Acid Jazz Band\" with fellow Israeli Jazz musicians, and performed regularly at the Red Sea Jazz Festival.\n\nIn 1994, Atzmon planned on studying abroad in the United States but ended up in England, attending the University of Essex and earning a master's degree in Philosophy, according to \"CounterPunch\". He has lived subsequently in the UK, becoming a British citizen in 2002, according to \"CounterPunch\" and renouncing his Israeli citizenship.\n\nWhile Atzmon's main instrument is the alto saxophone, he also plays soprano, tenor and baritone saxophones and clarinet, sol, zurna and flute.\n\nAtzmon told \"The Guardian\" that he draws on Arabic music which he says cannot be notated like western music but must be internalised, which he calls \"reverting to the primacy of the ear\". Atzmon's musical method has been to play with notions of cultural identity, flirting with genres such as tango and klezmer as well as various Arabic, Balkan, Gypsy and Ladino folk forms. Atzmon's recordings deliberately differ from his live shows. \"I don't think that anyone can sit in a house, at home, and listen to me play a full-on bebop solo. It's too intense. My albums need to be less manic.\"\n\nAtzmon joined the veteran punk rock band Ian Dury and the Blockheads in 1998, and continued with the Blockheads after Dury's death. He has recorded two albums with Robert Wyatt, who describes him as \"one of the few musical geniuses I've ever met\".\n\nAtzmon founded the Orient House Ensemble band in London in 2000 with Asaf Sirkis on drums, Frank Harrison on piano and Oli Hayhurst on bass. In 2003 Yaron Stavi replaced Hayhurst. In 2009 Eddie Hick replaced Sirkis. The group was named after Orient House, the former East Jerusalem headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The band has recorded eight albums. Orient House announced a 40-date tour in 2010.\n\nRobert Wyatt, who has said that Atzmon combines \"great artistry with a sense of the intrinsically non-racialist philosophy that's implicit in jazz,\" worked with Atzmon and others on his album \"Comicopera\" (2007). Wyatt collaborated with Atzmon and Ros Stephens, as well as lyricist Alfreda Benge, on the album \"For the Ghosts Within\" (2010), released on Domino Records.\n\nAtzmon produced and arranged two albums for Sarah Gillespie \"Stalking Juliet \"(2009) and \"In The Current Climate \"(2011). Both albums were critically acclaimed. He has toured extensively as a member of Sarah Gillespie's band, playing saxophone, clarinet and accordion.\n\nIn 2014, Atzmon performed on The Endless River, the last album of Pink Floyd.\n\nAtzmon is on the creative panel of the Global Music Foundation, a non-profit organization formed in December 2004 which runs residential educational and performance workshops and events in different countries around the world. A musical transcription of ten saxophone solos by Atzmon was released in 2010.\n\nAccording to reviewer Chris Searle in 2010, writing in the \"Morning Star\", \"No jazz musicians have done more to honour, publicise and spread solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinians than Atzmon and the Orient House Ensemble.”\n\nAtzmon and his ensemble have received favorable reviews from the \"Financial Times\", \"The Scotsman\", and the \"Birmingham Post\". Reviews of his 2007 album \"Refuge\" included:\n\nIn February 2009, \"The Guardian\" jazz critic John Fordham reviewed Atzmon's newest album \"In loving memory of America\" which was described by Atzmon as \"a memory of America I had cherished in my mind for many years\". It includes five standards and six originals \"inspired by the sumptuous harmonies and impassioned sax-playing of (Charlie) Parker's late-40s recordings with classical strings\".\n\nWhile music journalist John Lewis has praised much of Atzmon's work, he notes that \"trenchant politics often sit uneasily alongside music, particularly when that music is instrumental\". In a 2009 profile in The Guardian, Lewis criticized his 2006 comedy klezmer project, Artie Fishel and the Promised Band, as \"a clumsy satire on what he regards as the artificial nature of Jewish identity politics.\" While Lewis described Atzmon as \"one of London's finest saxophonists\", he observed that: \"It is Atzmon's blunt anti-Zionism rather than his music that has given him an international profile, particularly in the Arab world, where his essays are widely read.\"\nAtzmon's \"Exile\" was BBC jazz album of the year in 2003.\n\nAtzmon has defined himself variously as \"not a Jew anymore. I indeed despise the Jew in me (whatever is left)\", a \"proud self-hating Jew\" in the style of Otto Weininger, \"a Jew who hates Judaism\", and as \"a Hebrew-speaking Palestinian\". \n\nHe has said: \"I don't write about politics, I write about ethics. I write about Identity. I write a lot about the Jewish Question – because I was born in the Jew-land, and my whole process in maturing into an adult was involved with the realisation that my people are living on stolen land.\" Atzmon has said that his experience in the military of \"my people destroying other people left a big scar\" and led to his decision that he was deluded about Zionism. Atzmon has compared \"the Jewish Ideology\" to that of the Nazis and has described Israel's policy toward the Palestinians as genocide. He has condemned \"Jewishness\" as \"very much a supremacist, racist tendency\", but has also stated that \"I don't have anything against Jews in particular and you won't find that in my writings\". Regarding the one-state solution, Atzmon concedes that such a state probably would be controlled by Islamists, but says, \"That's their business\".\n\nAtzmon has written for \"CounterPunch\" and \"The Palestine Chronicle\". In 2009, he wrote for and edited the website, \"Palestine Think Tank\".\n\nAtzmon's \"A Guide to the Perplexed\", published in 2001, is set in a 2052 in which Israel has been replaced by a Palestinian state. Jeffrey St. Clair in \"CounterPunch\" describes it as \"vividly written satire, infused with a ribald sense of humor and an unsparing critique of the incendiary political cauldron of the Mideast.\" It largely reviews memoirs of the alienated Israeli Gunther Wunker's rise to fame as a \"peepologist\", or voyeur. The perplexed are defined as \"the unthinking Chosen\" who \"cling to clods of earth that don't belong to them.\" The novel excoriates what it describes as the commercialization of the Holocaust and \"argues that the Holocaust is invoked as a kind of reflexive propaganda designed to shield the Zionist state from responsibility for any transgression against Palestinians.\"\n\nMatthew J. Reisz, a reviewer for \"The Independent\", wrote that \"As a viciously black satire on Israeli life\" the book \"is grandiose, childish and nasty, but with just enough connection with reality to give it a certain unsettling power\". Darren King in \"The Observer\" noted of this \"provocative debut novel\" that it is \"odd to mix knob gags with highly serious assertions\", but thought it works because \"Atzmon writes with so much style and his gags are so hilarious\". \n\nAtzmon's second novel, \"My One and Only Love\", was published in 2005 and features as a protagonist a trumpeter who chooses to play only one note (extremely well), as well as a spy who uncovers Nazi war criminals and locks them inside double bass cases which then tour permanently in the protagonist's orchestra's luggage. The book is also a comedic take on \"Zionist espionage and intrigue\" which explores \"the personal conflict between being true to one’s heart and being loyal to The Jews\". By 2009, his two comic novels had been published in 24 languages.\n\nAtzmon's 2015 book, \"A to Zion: The Definitive Israeli Lexicon\", was summarised by Eugene Schulman in \"CounterPunch\" as \"designed to alphabetically define certain aspects of Zionism and Zionist personalities in one-liner jabs.\" and called it as a book which would \"knock a hole in all your prejudices.\".\n\nAtzmon's fifth book, \"Being in Time: A Post-Political Manifesto\", published in 2017, was described by James Petras as \"a brilliant and substantive critique of identity politics and Jewish political ideology and culture\" and as \"an essential read for understanding and confronting authoritarianism of all stripes and colors.\" Keith Kahn-Harris, in an opinion piece, argued that its critique of identity politics and ascription of it to Jewishness was inherently antisemitic.\n\nIn 2011, Zero Books published Atzmon's book, \"The Wandering Who? A Study of Jewish Identity Politics\", stating that it \"examines Jewish identity politics and Jewish contemporary ideology using both popular culture and scholarly texts.\"\n\nMarc H. Ellis likens Atzmon's rhetorical extremism and harsh censure of Jews to the prophetic voices of the Old Testament, arguing that, for Atzmon, diasporic Jews are asked to construct their identity on the basis of the State of Israel and the Holocaust, an identity he regards as without foundation. He adds that Atzmon considers charges that he is antisemitic as 'last ditch attempts' to validate that identity. In Ellis's view, there may be, in the perceived anxiety in these repeated attacks, a reflection of the same anxiety Atzmon himself arguably embodies.\n\nIn \"The Atlantic\", Jeffrey Goldberg described Atzmon as \"jazz saxophonist who lives in London and who has a side gig disseminating the wildest sort of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories\", and described several instances of Holocaust denial and antisemitic discourse by Atzmon including: describing the Holocaust as \"the new Western religion\", that Hitler was persecuted by Jews, and that Jews traffic in body parts. Goldberg notes that even Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions activists have repudiated him. According to Goldberg, Atzmon in the book calls for renewed scholarship into the veracity of long-rejected medieval blood libels.\n\nAccording to Alan Dershowitz in \"The New Republic\", at least ten authors associated with the publisher called on it to distance itself from Atzmon’s views, asserting that the “thrust of Atzmon’s work is to normalise and legitimise anti-Semitism.”\n\nIn December 2004, Atzmon stated that \"I'm not going to say whether it is right or not to burn down a synagogue, I can see that it is a rational act\". This statement was included in a dossier of alleged antisemitic behaviour at the institution prepared by the Board of Deputies of British Jews.\n\nIn a 2005 opinion piece, David Aaronovitch criticized Atzmon for his essay \"On Anti-Semitism\" and for circulating an article promoting Holocaust denial. In June, members of the Jews Against Zionism (JAZ) group protested in front of a London bookshop against an appearance by Atzmon who was criticized by JAZ for circulating a Paul Eisen work that defended Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel.\n\nIn a 2006 opinion piece, David Hirsh criticised what he called Atzmon's \"openly anti-Jewish rhetoric\", including Jewish deicide. In response to a question about this Atzmon replied, in \"CounterPunch\", \"I find it astonishing that people today happen to be offended by such accusations (i.e. about an event almost 2000 years ago.)\"\n\nIn 2011, David Landy, an Irish academic and former chair of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, wrote that Atzmon's words, \"if not actually anti-Semitic, certainly border on it\". \n\nA group of Palestinian activists, including Ali Abunimah, Naseer Aruri, Omar Barghouti, Nadia Hijab and Joseph Massad, called in March 2012 for \"the disavowal of Atzmon by fellow Palestinian organizers, as well as Palestine solidarity activists, and allies of the Palestinian people\" and affirming that \"we regard any attempt to link and adopt antisemitic or racist language, even if it is within a self-described anti-imperialist and anti-Zionist politics, as reaffirming and legitimizing Zionism.\"\n\nAt a talk by Richard A. Falk at LSE in March 2017, which was being disrupted by pro-Israel activists, Atzmon was alleged to have commented that Jews had been \"expelled from Germany for misbehaving\" and also to have suggested that people should read Holocaust denier David Irving.\n\nIn 2018, Islington Council banned Atzmon from performing at the Islington Assembly Hall, as the council feared Atzmon's appearance could harm relationships with religious communities.\n\nDavid Neiwert, writing in the Southern Poverty Law Center's \"Hatewatch\", described Atzmon as \"a self-described 'self-hating ex-Jew' whose writings and pronouncements are rich in conspiracy theories, Holocaust trivialization and distortion, and open support of anti-Israeli terrorist groups.\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League described Atzmon as \"an outspoken promoter of classic anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and a fierce\ncritic of the State of Israel (who) has engaged in Holocaust diminution and has defended the right of\nHolocaust deniers to challenge historical narratives and offer revisionist theories about the Holocaust.\".\n\nHope not Hate described Atzmon as \"an antisemite who has promoted the works of Holocaust deniers\", relating the Holocaust denial support mainly to circulating a work of Paul Eisen. \n\nAccording to David Hirsh, Atzmon attempted to lead an antisemitic purge of the anti-zionist movement, however runs counter to the anti-Racist values of most anti-zionists. Despite this, it took some time for the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and Socialist Workers Party to stop treating Atzmon as legitimite.\n\nNicolas Terry characterized Atzmon, along with Paul Eisen and Israel Shamir, as one of the very few Jewish Holocaust deniers who were associated with deir Yassin Remembered. Terry notes that after the Palestine Solidarity Campaign expelled several Holocaust deniers, Atzmon rallied other sympathisers around the \"Deliberation\" website.\n\nAtzmon describes charges of antisemitism as being a \"common Zionist silencing apparatus.\" and claims that \"there is an international smear campaign against me.\" \nAccording to Atzmon, his statements have lost him performance contracts, especially in the United States, while in Britain, the Campaign Against Antisemitism has sought to stop him performing.\n\nAtzmon has written that he was quoted inaccurately and out of context. Atzmon has acccused the anti-fascist Hope Not Hate as being “an integral part of the Zionist network, dedicated to promoting Jewish tribal politics”. In 2009, Atzmon said \"I've got nothing against the Semite people, I don't have anything against people — I'm anti-Jewish, not anti-Jews.\" \n\nOren Ben-Dor wrote in \"CounterPunch\" in 2008 \"I am firmly convinced that these vulgar attempts at silencing of Gilad and other courageous voices offends against supremely thoughtful, compassionate and egalitarian intellectual endeavours.\"\n\nIn 2012, Norton Mezvinsky wrote that \"Gilad Atzmon is a critical and committed secular humanist with firm views, who delights in being provocative.\"\n\nIn July 2018, Atzmon was forced to apologise to Gideon Falter, the chairman of the Campaign Against Antisemitism and agreed to pay costs and damages, after being sued for libel. Atzmon had falsely alleged that Falter had profited from fabricating antisemitic incidents. Atzmon had sought help from his supporters to cover the remaining £40,000 of legal costs and damages.\n\nAtzmon has two children and lives in London.\n\n\n\n\n"}

But gradually the number of ovens has increased and there were more than a thousand coke-ovens of by-product type. This method of blending was adopted by all the subsequent manufacturers.\n\nShimomura was one of the earliest workers on ammonium sulphate to produce it on a large scale and put it on the market as a fertilizer in the days when its superiority to sodium nitrate in Japanese soils was not very well recognized. He was not an expert in tar distillation and was among the first to produce naphthalene in powder, balls and cakes at a time when its smell was objected to as something unbearable. \n\nHe was the first to put up a plant to extract benzene from coke-oven gas, when it was thought that it would not sell. This fear was subsequently contradicted by increased demand for benzene as solvent, motor oil and also an important raw material for dyestuffs. In the time of the world war, Japan was amply provided with benzene obtained from coke-oven gas to make the manufacture of dyestuffs independent of foreign supply.\n\nWhen Dr. Shimomura became connected with Osaka Gas Company, it was producing to supply about 700,000 c. ft. per day of gas. As a director, he was responsible for the extensions up to the several millions c. ft. a day. With the Osaka Seimi Works Company a similar growth took place and he was responsible for the works development from one battery to three batteries, from 16 to 73 ovens, from 600 tons of coke to 6000 tons per month.\n\nIn the year 1909 he determined to devote the surplus gas of the by-product ovens of the Seimi Works of two companies, the Osaka Gas and the Seimi, and by means of a compressor which had been used for riveting a gas-holder, about 200,00 c. ft. were sent out daily under high pressure. This is regarded as the first attempt in Japan to use the high-pressure conveyance, the method since then becoming so prevalent in this country,\n\nThe importance of subjecting railway sleepers to some preserving process was insisted on by Dr. Shiga, and a company was formed to use creosote oil mixed with Zinc compound; but owing to the lack of tar oil, the enterprise was in a precarious condition, when Dr. Shimomura was enabled to put a large quantity of creosote oil to its use, resulting in the formation of the Toyo Wood Preserving Company. The wood preserving business has steadily developed.\n\nIn his travels abroad, besides investigating coke-ovens, he took every opportunity to get a glimpse of the dyestuffs works and was favored with rare chances of inspecting inside of some works in England. When the world war broke out, he was found to be one of the very few among native chemists who had given any attention to the preparation of dyestuffs and was asked to take the position of the managing chief chemist to start the works of company, - the Japan Dyestuff Manufacturing Company. In view of the extraordinary circumstances, he consented to do so in spite of the impaired eyesight under which he was suffering. Thus was inaugurated the manufacturing of the dyestuffs on a large scale, one of the most ambitious projects that Japan had ever undertaken in competition with the West.\n\nDoshisha University:\nOsaka Seimi Works Company (amalgamation with the Osaka Gas Company):\nOsaka Gas Company:\nToyo (Oriental) Wood Preserving Company:\nKobe Gas Company:\nJapan Dyestuff Manufacturing Company (amalgamation with the Sumitomo Chemical):\n"}

It aired on May 13, 2004, in the 11th year of the series. In syndication, it is a two-part episode.\n\nFrasier (Kelsey Grammer) is on an airplane when he is surprised by the anxiety the woman sitting next to him suffers during the flight. The woman introduces herself as Dr. Anne Ranberg (Jennifer Beals), also a psychiatrist, and after brief deliberation, Frasier decides to disclose what is on his mind, in hopes that it will help pass the time on the flight.\n\nFrasier's girlfriend, Charlotte (Laura Linney), is leaving for Chicago, leaving Frasier devoid of any current love life. To commemorate her leaving for Chicago, Frasier and Charlotte sleep together on her final night in Seattle, resulting in a problem as Frasier misses his regularly scheduled radio show, which results in station manager Kenny Daly taking over at the last minute who quickly starts to enjoy himself. Once Frasier arrives, he bumps into his agent Bebe, where he learns about a job opening on a San Francisco television network after a death occurred there, but Frasier quickly declines, citing his comfort with his present situation at KACL. In the meantime, his brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce) and Niles' wife Daphne (Jane Leeves) are anticipating the birth of their child, while his father, Martin (John Mahoney), is set to be married to Ronee (Wendie Malick). A mishap occurs when Martin schedules the wedding for May 15 instead of July 15. Frasier and Niles agree to plan the wedding in eight days.\n\nAs the two are frantically putting the wedding together, both Frasier and Niles encounter numerous difficulties. Three of Daphne's brothers, Simon, Stephen, and Michael, are in Seattle in anticipation of Daphne's childbirth. Frasier has arranged for a ceremonial cannon-firing when Martin and Ronee are officially declared married. However, the person Frasier puts in position has a heat stroke from standing out in the sun too long, making him unusable. Stephen volunteers to do the job instead and is told the cue from Frasier. However, Frasier and Niles also have to deal with finding a new flower girl, as the three brothers have accidentally intoxicated her, rendering her unconscious. Roz (Peri Gilpin) allows her daughter Alice to do the job in the flower girl's stead, but upon receiving the same cue as Michael was told, Michael fires off the cannon, creating havoc in the neighborhood. Daphne and Niles realize Eddie has eaten the rings and take him to a local veterinarian. While they are at the vet's office, Daphne goes into labor. Frasier, Martin, and Ronee all hurry to the clinic, where Daphne has given birth to the couple's first child, whom they name David. Ronee suggests that she and Martin get married in the clinic, so Daphne and Niles do not miss out, and Frasier marries them.\n\nLater, a mover (the same from the first episode) returns to Frasier's residence to take away Martin's chair. Frasier calls Lilith to ask after Frederick. Afterwards, he finds himself with the peace and quiet he was once desperate for. However, with Martin having moved out and Niles and Daphne busy with their new son, Frasier realises that he is lonely. He decides to take the job in San Francisco. The following day, Frasier and his colleagues learn that Roz has been promoted to station manager after Kenny quits to become a DJ. Frasier invites his brother, father, Daphne, Ronee, and Roz to his apartment to announce his move to San Francisco. However, before the dinner, Frasier begins handing out gifts of significance. When an ominous phone call answered by the answering machine from a doctor reveals potentially bad news regarding Frasier's future outlook, the attendees fear the worst. Frasier then informs them of his impending move to San Francisco, where his new show will begin the following week. Later, during the celebration, Frasier reveals his reasoning for taking the job, citing that with Daphne and Niles' child, Martin and Ronee's marriage, and Roz's promotion, each of them have now begun a new phase of their lives, and that he now desires to do the same. Frasier then recites Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem \"Ulysses\". He reads the same poem at the end of his final show at KACL, where he thanks the staff and listeners for the past eleven years before closing with his signature words \"Goodnight, Seattle.\"\n\nFrasier finishes his story just as the plane lands – not in San Francisco, but in Chicago, where Charlotte has moved – and says, \"Wish me luck,\" to Anne before heading down the aisle as the screen fades to black.\n\nThe poem Frasier quotes in this episode is a shortened version of Alfred, Lord Tennyson’s \"Ulysses\":\n\"It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;\n<br>It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,\n<br>And though we are not now that strength which in old days\n<br>Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are—\n<br>\"[Scene shifts to Frasier’s KACL booth.]\"\n<br>Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will;\n<br>To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\"\n<br>I’ve been thinking about that poem a lot lately. And I think what it says is that, while it’s tempting to play it safe, the more we’re willing to risk, the more alive we are. In the end, what we regret most are the chances we never took. And I hope that explains, at least a little, this journey on which I am about to embark. I have loved every minute with my KACL family, and all of you. For eleven years you've heard me say, \"I’m listening.\" Well, \"you\" were listening, too. And for that I am eternally grateful. Goodnight, Seattle.\n\nThe episode was viewed by 33.7 million being the 11th most watched series finale and the 7th most watched from NBC.\n\nThe episode had an overwhelmingly positive reception. In 2011, the finale was ranked #17 on the TV Guide Network special, \"TV's Most Unforgettable Finales.\"\n\n"}

The Glenelg tram line runs along the middle of the street through the city centre.\n\nIt was named by the Street Naming Committee on 23 May 1837 after King William IV, the then reigning monarch, who died within a month. It is historically considered one of Adelaide's high streets, for its focal point of businesses, shops and other prominent establishments.\n\nIn August 1977, the first bus lane in Adelaide opened along King William Street from Victoria Square to North Terrace.\n\nThe name \"King William\" is applied several times to the continuous stretch of road that begins in the inner southern suburbs and terminates in North Adelaide. Where it runs through the Adelaide city centre from South Terrace to North Terrace, it is named \"King William Street\"; elsewhere it is named \"King William Road\".\n\nIt starts in the south as King William Road, at the north edge of Heywood Park in Unley Park, and runs through Hyde Park and Unley to Greenhill Road. The road through the south parklands is named Peacock Road after Caleb Peacock who was Mayor of Adelaide from 1875 to 1877.

The northern section called King William Road (connecting the Adelaide city centre with North Adelaide) passes several of Adelaide's landmarks, including Government House, Elder Park, the Adelaide Festival Centre, Adelaide Oval and St Peter's Cathedral. The section from North Terrace over the Adelaide Bridge to Pennington Terrace was named King William Road at the opening of the bridge in 1877.\n\nUntil the 1960s, trams used King William Street as a major backbone of the network, with a grand union junction at North Terrace and only one pair of tracks missing between Grenfell and Currie Streets. When most of the tram lines were dismantled in the 1950s, only the Glenelg tram line remained, and it used King William Street between South Terrace and its terminus at Victoria Square.\n\nIn 2007, the tram line was extended to run the full length of King William Street again, turning left onto North Terrace and terminating at Adelaide railway station, later extended westwards via Port Road to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre. In 2018, another expansion of the tram routes replaced the turn at the intersection of North Terrace and King William Street with a junction, and a short spur to a stop outside the Adelaide Festival Centre as well as an eastward extension along North Terrace to the Adelaide Botanic Garden. Tracks go in all four directions, but not all turning movements are supported.\n\nBetween North Terrace and South Terrace, all east-west roads change their names as they cross King William Street. It is said this is because no one was allowed to \"cross the path of a monarch\".

The traditional custodians of the area are the Guringai people.\n\nThe area was known as \"Bongin Bongin\" by Aboriginal Peoples. The initial land grants in the district of Pittwater were not made until April 1813, and those sections which now comprise Mona Vale, first surveyed in May 1814, were granted to Robert Campbell (1769-1846). These were originally part of that extended northwards from Mona Vale to the end of Newport beach. Local lore suggests the name Mona Vale was chosen by Campbell in remembrance of a town bearing the same name in Scotland, however the exact location of this place remains a mystery. In 2005, Mona Vale became the administrative centre of Pittwater Council, after the council chambers moved from Warriewood. Since then, Pittwater Council has been amalgamated with Warringah and Manly to form the Northern Beaches Council.\n\nMona Vale has two primary schools and a high school, an RSL club, a park, public library, golf course, hospital, a world class skate park, a bus depot, three supermarkets, and a variety of shops and businesses.

He represented the 3rd District from 1911 to 1915, and the 4th District from 1915 to 1919.\n\nIn 1854 William's father, Harvey LaFollette, was just 22 years old and newly married. He moved from Indiana to Primrose, Wisconsin to join his older brother Josiah (15 years his senior) in a farming venture. The LaFollettes had lived in the Knob Creek area of Kentucky for a generation before William's grandfather, Jesse LaFollette relocated his entire family to Putnam County, Indiana in order to leave land title and slavery issues behind him.\n\nWilliam's brother, Harvey Marion LaFollette, and his cousin, Robert M. La Follette, Sr., were both born in Primrose in log cabins built by the two LaFollette brothers. After Josiah's premature death from diabetes, William's father returned to Indiana, settling near other LaFollette relatives where he continued farming and built a flour mill. William's birth took place shortly after his family's arrived in Thorntown, Indiana late in 1860.\nFor five years additional siblings arrived and his family grew and prospered. Tragedy struck in 1865 when his father was killed in an industrial accident at the mill. William worked on the farm, clerked in a store, learned the jewelry business, and attended the local normal (public) schools.\n\nWilliam and his older brother, Harvey, both left their Indiana home in 1876. Harvey travelled to Europe to continue his studies in Paris. The sixteen-year-old William headed west to the Washington Territory and took up farming in Whitman County, an area in the Palouse that had been off limits to settlers since the Indian Wars of the 1850s. Too young to qualify for land under the Homestead Act, he returned to Indiana where he took some business courses at Central Indiana Normal College (now Canterbury College (Indiana).\n\nHe returned to the Palouse after these studies, staked his claim and began farming. He engaged in agricultural pursuits (mainly wheat), stock raising, and fruit growing. Later, he was extensively engaged as an orchardist at Wawawai on the Snake River, having purchased some 375 ac from his father-in-law, John Tabor (one of the founders of Whitman County) who had been among the first settlers to bring apples to the region.\n\nHe added to these fruit holdings, expanded his crops, built an aerial tramway to transfer the fruit across river to access the new railroad, created a sawmill to make the wooden boxes for shipping, and was responsible for making Wawawai the largest shipping point for fruit along the Snake River.\n\nHe shipped many vegetables and hogs as well as fruit and, by the early 1900s, his land holdings along the river exceeded 1000 ac. In order to educate his family, La Follette built a large home in Pullman to be near Washington State College. He sold a large portion of his fruit holdings and entered the world of national politics.\n\nLa Follette was a member of the World's Fair Commission and had charge of the Washington State building at the Chicago Exposition in 1893. He served as a member of the State House of Representatives from 1899 to 1901. He also served on the School Board and was an active member of the Grange. He was elected as a Republican to the Sixty-second and to the three succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1911 to March 3, 1919). He was active on the House Committee on Public Lands and engaged deeply in land use and water issues. His policy interests reached far beyond the region he represented in the Pacific Northwest. He fought for the passage of bills that brought water to San Francisco and the creation of the National Park Service. He joined with his cousin, Robert M. La Follette in opposing President Woodrow Wilson's foreign policy decisions, and like his cousin voted against declaring war on Germany.\nFor much of the time he was in Congress, the two LaFollette families shared a large house that he had purchased in Mount Pleasant, Washington D.C. The house became a center for debate and discussions of the great issues of the day as a steady stream of politicians, policy makers, academics, artists and labor and business leaders debated late into the night. In 1918 he ran unsuccessfully for renomination in the Republican primary.\n\nAfter leaving elected office La Follette resided in Spokane, Washington from 1920 to 1923 and in Princess Anne, Maryland from 1924 to 1925.After the failed presidential bid and death of his cousin Robert, William La Follette returned permanently to the Palouse. He moved to Colfax, Washington in 1927 and resumed his former business activities. Both he and his wife, Mary Tabor, died in 1934.\n\nHe was a member of the politically prominent La Follette family. His son, William Leroy \"Roy\" LaFollette Jr., served for many years as Prosecuting Attorney for Whitman County (1922–1930 and again during World War II). He successfully ran for his father's old seat in the Washington House of Representatives in 1939, but was defeated in 1942 in a bid for Congress.\nOne of his daughters, Suzanne La Follette, became a noted libertarian journalist. She helped to found \"The Freeman\" and \"National Review\" magazines.\nAnother son, Chester La Follette, was a painter whose portrait of his father's first cousin, U.S. Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. of Wisconsin, hangs in the United States Capitol.\n\nWilliam La Follette Sr.'s brother, Harvey Marion LaFollette, served as Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction before moving to Tennessee, where he founded the city of LaFollette, Tennessee.\n"}

Sheffield has long been the rural hub for the Mount Roland area. The Sheffield area is well known for its high quality butterfat production via dairy farming. The area is suitable for lamb and beef production. The town of Railton is nearby. At the , Sheffield had a population of 1,552.\n\nSheffield was one of the many early townships settled in 1859. The town was named by Edward Curr after his home town in South Yorkshire, England. \"Kentishbury\" Post Office opened on 1 November 1862 and was renamed \"Sheffield\" in 1882.\n\nThe area grew slowly and the commencement of the Mersey-Forth Power Development Scheme in 1963 saw the town grow dramatically. The completion of the power scheme –- seven dams and seven power stations –- in 1973 saw the town's population decline.\n\nSheffield's revival as the Town of Murals began as a bid by a small group of residents determined to save their town.\n\nInspired by the story of Chemainus, a small Canadian town that had through mural art, rescued itself from ruin, the Kentish Association for Tourism (KAT) worked on the vision to combine the arts and tourism to revive and reinvent the town of Sheffield.\n\nSheffield has become a major tourist attraction due to it being promoted as a \"Town of Murals\", based upon the instrumental contributions of the Kentish Association for Tourism (currently known as Sheffield Inc) and local tourism pioneer Brian Inder.\n\nThe first town mural was painted in Sheffield in December 1986. Since then over 60 murals depicting the area's rich history and beautiful natural scenery have been painted on walls throughout the town and buildings along the roadside. The murals attract an estimated 200,000 people to the town annually.\n\nA number of studios are open to the public where visitors can watch the artists work. There are artists of many disciplines, including photography, fine art, glass, woodcraft, pottery, ceramics and specialised crafts.\n\nThe International Mural Fest art competition has been held annually since 2003 and returns in April each year. A poem is selected, which the artists use as their inspiration. After each competition the nine finalist murals remain on display at Mural Park until the next competition. In 2012, an interactive mural and workshops were added to the artistic activities of the festival for the Mural Fest 10th anniversary celebrations.\n\nSheffield hosts the annual two-day Tasmanian Medieval Festival every October. The festival includes sword fighting, fencing, archery, jousting and demonstrations of working cannons and trebuchets. The festival has grown in popularity since its inception, with 4000 people attending the event in 2018.\n\nThere are many natural attractions in the Sheffield area.\n\nMount Roland is the backdrop of the Sheffield township rising 1234 metres above sea level.\n\nMount Roland Conservation Area & Regional Reserve \nThe reserve consists of 7600 hectares surrounding the range. A number of well marked bushwalks provide a day's exercise. There are walking tracks from Claude Road and Gowrie Park to the summit. The walk includes the plains and plateau leading to the peak. There are two tracks to the summit, which provide 360-degree views to Bass Strait, Cradle Mountain and Barn Bluff.\n\nLake Barrington is known as an international standard rowing venue and the site of the 1990 World Rowing Championships. It was created in 1969 by building the Devils Gate Dam on the Forth River.\n\nThe lake is a popular water ski location with access via West Kentish and Wilmot. There are two water ski clubs based at Lake Barrington: Kentish Aquatic Club and Horsehead Water Ski Club.\n\nThe lake is also used for canoeing and trout fishing. There is an adventure playground and a two-hour rainforest walk. Facilities for visitors include picnic sites, boat ramps and toilets.\n\nThe Devils Gate Dam has an overhanging crest that allows flood water to freefall to the river bed, with up to 2000 tonnes of water falling per second during an extreme flood.\n\nIt is one of the thinnest concrete arch dams in the world. It was completed by the Hydro-Electric Commission in 1969 and is 84 metres high. The narrowness of the gorge and the computer-aided design of its double-curvature shape enabled engineers to minimise the volume of concrete and hence the cost of the dam. Flood waters falling freely from the crest strike concrete slabs carefully positioned on the abutments to prevent undermining of the dam by erosion.\n\nThe walk starts at the junction just before turning into the Lemonthyme Lodge. The walk takes about two hours and allows visitors to observe the varieties of vegetation of the area. After crossing two areas of cleared land the track crosses a fern gully, beyond which there is more forest until the track terminates in the backwater of the lake. This walk is graded as hard because the return trip is a long haul uphill.\n\nKimberley Warm Springs are a geothermal feature and semi-developed visitor site located in the town of Kimberley. The micro climate created by the warm springs creates a unique habitat.\nThe small town of Gowrie Park is located 16 kilometres south of Sheffield. It is a starting point for walkers climbing Mount Roland. The town has a history as a Hydro construction village.\n\nCradle Mountain is approximately one hour's drive south-west of the township. The mountain is accessible from the northern end of the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park. There are numerous walks available, ranging from short to multi-day.\n\nMost of the South West and West Coast Hydro Tasmania power stations are controlled from the Hydro control centre in Sheffield \n\nSheffield won the Australian Tidy Town Award in 2014.\n\n"}

Buchanan, Sr was an American jazz trumpeter and teacher who became an early mentor of Miles Davis.\n\nBuchanan was born in St Louis, Missouri on January 26, 1907, and was trained in music by Joseph Gustat, the principal trumpeter with the St Louis Symphony Orchestra. He began his career playing in local dance bands, including Andy Kirk's orchestra, and on the riverboats that travelled on the Mississippi River between St Louis and New Orleans. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, he taught music and directed the band at Lincoln High School in East St Louis, and also visited the local elementary schools to give weekly lessons. Buchanan was known for his strict and demanding teaching style, and for encouraging pupils to compete with one another.\n\nBuchanan was a patient of Miles Davis's father, who told him of his son's interest in music. Although Davis, at thirteen, was then too young to attend Buchanan's school, Buchanan began giving him private lessons. Davis joined the school band when he began attending Lincoln. Although Buchanan had the band play mainly marches rather than jazz, the techniques he taught profoundly affected Davis' jazz style. In particular, Buchanan went against the times by recommending to his students that they play without vibrato, and is said to have broken Davis of the habit by rapping his knuckles with a ruler and commanding: \"Stop shakin' that note. You're going to shake enough when you get old\". Buchanan also encouraged Davis to study the lean, relaxed playing of Bobby Hackett (then little known beyond the East Coast) and Harold Shorty Baker. In this, too, Buchanan went against fashion; the most popular trumpeter of the day was Louis Armstrong, whose hot playing style was very different from those of Hackett or Baker.\n\nDavis later credited Buchanan with persuading his parents to buy him a new trumpet, rather than a violin as his mother had preferred. Buchanan also introduced Davis to Clark Terry, who would become his recording partner.\n\nIn his autobiography, Davis recalled: \"Mr. Buchanan was the biggest influence on my life up until then. He was definitely the person who took me all the way into music at that time.\" \n\n"}

{"id": "2008859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008859", "title": "Coele-Syria", "text": "Coele-Syria\n\nCoele-Syria, Coele Syria, Coelesyria (, \"Koílē Syría\"), also rendered as Coelosyria and Celesyria, otherwise Hollow Syria (), was a region of Syria in classical antiquity. It probably derived from the Aramaic for \"all\" of the region of Syria but more often was applied to the Beqaa Valley between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountain ranges. The area now forms part of the modern nations of Lebanon and Syria.\n\nIt is widely accepted that the term Coele is a transcription of Aramaic \"kul\", meaning \"all, the entire\", such that the term originally identified \"all\" of Syria. The word \"Coele\", which literally means \"hollow\" in Koine Greek, is thought to have come about via a folk etymology referring to the \"hollow\" Beqaa Valley between Mount Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon mountains. However, the term Coele-Syria was also used in a wider sense to indicate \"all Syria\" or \"all Syria except Phoenicia\", by the writers; Pliny, Arrian, Ptolemy and also Diodorus Siculus, who indicated Coele-Syria to at least stretch as far south as Joppa, while Polybius stated that the border between Egypt and Coele-Syria lay between the towns of Rhinocolara and Rhaphia.\n\nThe first and only official use of the term was during the period of Seleucid rule of the region, between c. 200 BCE and 64 BCE. During this period, the term \"Coele Syria and Phoenicia\" or \"Coele Syria\" was also used in a narrower sense to refer to the former Ptolemaic territory which the Seleucids now controlled, being the area south of the river Eleutherus. This usage was adopted by Strabo and the Books of the Maccabees. However, Greek writers such as Agatharchides and Polemon of Athens used the term Palestine to refer to the region during this period, which was a term originally given circa 450 BCE by Herodotus. Later during the Roman Period c.350 CE, Eunapius wrote that the capital of Coele-Syria was the Seleucid city of Antioch, north of the Eleutherus.\n\nAccording to Polybius, a former officer of the Ptolemaic Empire named Ptolemy Thrasea, having fought in the 217 BCE Battle of Raphia, defected to the Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great. Antiochus gave him the title \"Strategos and Archiereus of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia\". Some scholars speculate that this title may have been used previously by the Ptolemies, but no direct evidence exists to support this.\n\nThe region was disputed between the Seleucid dynasty and the Ptolemaic dynasty during the Syrian Wars. Alexander the Great's general Ptolemy first occupied Coele-Syria in 318 BC. However, when Ptolemy joined the coalition against Antigonus I Monophthalmus in 313 BC, he quickly withdrew from Coele-Syria. In 312 BC Seleucus I Nicator, defeated Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, in the Battle of Gaza which again allowed Ptolemy to occupy Coele-Syria. Though he was again to pull out after only a few months, after Demetrius had won a battle over his general and Antigonus entered Syria in force up to Antigonuses, this brief success had enabled Seleucus to make a dash for Babylonia which Seleucus secured. In 302 BC, Ptolemy joined a new coalition against Antigonus and reoccupied Coele-Syria, but quickly withdrew on hearing a false report that Antigonus had won a victory. He was only to return when Antigonus had been defeated at Ipsus in 301 BC. Coele-Syria was assigned to Seleucus, by the victors of Ipsus, as Ptolemy had added nothing to the victory. Though, given Ptolemy's track record, he was unlikely to organize a serious defense of Coele-Syria, Seleucus acquiesced in Ptolemy's occupation, probably because Seleucus remembered how it had been with Ptolemy's help he had reestablished himself in Babylonia.\n\nThe later Seleucids were not to be so understanding, resulting in the century of Syrian Wars between the Ptolemies and Seleucids. The Battle of Panium in 200 BC, during the Fifth Syrian War, was the final decisive battle between the two sides in ending Ptolemaic control over the region. The 171–168 BC conflicts over Coele-Syria, between Antiochus IV Epiphanes and Ptolemy VI Philometor, are discussed in Livy’s \"The History of Rome from its Foundation\" (in XLII. 29 and XLV. 11–12).\n\nSeleucid control over the area of Judea began diminishing with the eruption of the Maccabean Revolt in 165 BC. With Seleucid troops being involved in warfare on the Parthian front, Judea succeeded in securing its independence by 140 BC. Despite attempts of Seleucid rulers to regain territories, the conquests of Pompey in 64 BC were a decisive blow to them, and Syria became part of the Roman Republic.\n\nUnder the Macedonian kings, Upper Syria (Syria Superior) was divided into four parts (tetrarchies) which were named after their capitals. Later in the Roman Pompeian era, the province was divided into nine districts.\n\nJudging from Arrian and \"The Anabasis of Alexander\", the historians of Alexander the Great, as well as more ancient authors, gave the name of Syria to all the country comprehended between the Tigris and the Mediterranean. The part to the east of the Euphrates, afterwards named Mesopotamia was called \"Syria between the rivers;\" that to the west was called by the general name Coele-Syria, and although Phoenicia and Palestine were sometimes separated from it. Yet, it was often comprehended as the whole country as far as Egypt.\n\n\nIn the Wars of the Diadochi, Coele-Syria came under the control of Antigonus I Monophthalmus. Then in 301 BCE, Ptolemy I Soter exploited events surrounding the Battle of Ipsus to take control of the region. The victors at Ipsus finalized the breakup of Alexander's empire. Coele-Syria was allocated to Ptolemy's former ally Seleucus I Nicator, who—having been previously aided by Ptolemy—took no military action to gain control of the region. Their successors, however, became embroiled in a series of conflicts over this issue.\n\n\n\nAuthors of the Roman period differ on the limits of Coele-Syria, some extending and others contracting them. The \"Geography\" of Strabo notes that \"Coele Syria Propria (Proper)\" is defined by the \"Libanus\" and \"Anti-libanus\" mountain ranges, running parallel to each other. In the wars between the Ptolemies and the Seleucidæ, the name Cœle (or Hollow Syria) was applied to the whole of the southern portion of Syria, but under the Romans, it was confined to \"Cœlesyria Proper\" and variously included the district east of Anti-Libanus, about Damascus, and a portion of Palestine east of the Jordan river (possibly of: Trans-Jordan, Perea, or the Decapolis).\n\n\nThe name Syria comes from the ancient Greek regional name for the Levantine colonies and colonial territories which they had established and which were \"formerly comprehended as part of Assyria\" (see Name of Syria). Syria had an uncertain border to the northeast that Pliny the Elder describes as including from west to east; Commagene, Sophene, and Adiabene. In Pliny's time, Syria was administratively divided into a number of provinces with various degrees of autonomy under the Roman Empire, such as the Ityraei or Ituraei, who were a people of Coelo-Syria famous for shooting with a bow, [The wood of the trees called] \"yews are bent into Ituraean bows\".\n\n\n\nThe Decapolis was so called from its ten cities enumerated by Pliny. What \"Pliny\" calls \"Decapolis\", \"Ptolomy\" makes his \"Cœle-Syria\"; and the \"Cœle-Syria\" of \"Pliny\", is that part of \"Syria\" about \"Aleppo\".\n\n\nThe governor of Syria retained the civil administration of the whole large province undiminished, and held for long alone in all Asia a command of the first rank. It was only in the course of the second century that a diminution of his prerogatives occurred, when Hadrian took one of the four legions from the governor of Syria and handed it over to the governor of Palestine. It was Severus who at length withdrew the first place in the Roman military hierarchy from the Syrian governor. After having subdued the province —which had wished at that time to make Niger emperor, as it had formerly done with its governor Vespasian —amidst resistance from the capital Antioch in particular, he ordained its partition into a northern and a southern half, and gave to the governor of the former, which was called Coele-Syria, two legions, to the governor of the latter, the province of Syro-Phoenicia, one [legion].\n\nThere is also the colony of Laodicea, in Coele Syria, to which also the divine Severus granted the Italian Law on account of its services in the Civil War.\n\nYou may delineate the Promised Land of Moses from the Book of Numbers (ch. 34): as bounded on the south by the desert tract called Sina, between the Dead Sea and the city of Kadesh-barnea, [which is located with the Arabah to the east] and continues to the west, as far as the river of Egypt, that discharges into the open sea near the city of Rhinocolara; as bounded on the west by the sea along the coasts of Palestine, Phoenicia, Coele‑Syria, and Cilicia; as bounded on the north by the circle formed by the Taurus Mountains and Zephyrium and extending to Hamath, called Epiphany‑Syria; as bounded on the east by the city of Antioch Hippos and Lake Kinneret, now called Tiberias, and then the Jordan River which discharges into the salt sea, now called the Dead Sea.\n\nLibanius (died 392 CE) was born at Antioch, the capital of Coele Syria as it is called. This city was founded by Seleucus surnamed Nicator.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2008863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008863", "title": "Flightplan", "text": "Flightplan\n\nFlightplan is a 2005 psychological thriller mystery film directed by Robert Schwentke, written by Peter A. Dowling and Billy Ray, and starring Jodie Foster, Peter Sarsgaard, Erika Christensen, Kate Beahan, Greta Scacchi, Sean Bean, and Matt Bomer (in his film debut). A co-production of the United States and Germany, the film's narrative follows Kyle Pratt, a widowed American aircraft engineer living in Berlin, who flies back to the U.S. with her daughter and her husband's body only to lose her daughter during the flight and must struggle to find her while proving her sanity at the same time.\n\"Flightplan\" was distributed by Touchstone Pictures and was released worldwide theatrically on September 23, 2005. The film received mixed reviews from critics who acclaimed the performances of its cast but found the screenplay less competent. It grossed over $223 million.\n\nRecently-widowed Berlin-based American aviation engineer Kyle Pratt (Jodie Foster) is taking her husband David's body back to the U.S. after his untimely death. She and her 6-year-old daughter Julia (Marlene Lawston) board an Aalto Airlines Elgin 474, an aircraft Kyle helped design. Awakening from a short nap, Kyle finds Julia missing, and none of the passengers or crew recall seeing her. Flight attendant Stephanie (Kate Beahan) later claims there is no record of Julia boarding and the passenger manifest indicates the child's seat as unoccupied. Julia's boarding pass and backpack are also missing. Kyle insists Captain Marcus Rich (Sean Bean) conduct a thorough search of the aircraft.\n\nKyle becomes increasingly desperate, unjustly accusing two Arab passengers, Obaid (Michael Irby) and Ahmed (Assaf Cohen), of kidnapping Julia and plotting to hijack the aircraft. Captain Rich and the flight attendants, particularly Stephanie, suspect that, unhinged by her husband's death, Kyle might have imagined bringing her daughter on board. Because of her increasingly erratic and panicked behaviour, Captain Rich orders sky marshal Gene Carson (Peter Sarsgaard) to guard and handcuff her.\n\nLater, Captain Rich receives a wire from a Berlin hospital claiming that Julia died with her father. Kyle furiously denies this and insists the search continue. A therapist, Lisa (Greta Scacchi), consoles Kyle, who doubts her own sanity until she notices the heart Julia drew on the foggy window next to her seat. Kyle asks to use the bathroom; once inside, climbs through a trapdoor into the airliner's overhead crawl space. She sabotages the aircraft's electronics, deploying the oxygen masks and cutting power to the aircraft lighting. During the ensuing chaos, she rides a dumbwaiter to the lower freight deck where she finds and opens David's casket using the lock code, suspecting Julia may be trapped inside. It only contains her husband's body. Carson finds her and escorts her back to her seat in handcuffs. He says the flight is making an emergency stopover at Goose Bay Airport in Newfoundland, Canada where she will be taken into custody.\n\nKyle makes a final plea to Carson to search the aircraft upon landing. Before speaking to the captain, Carson sneaks down the freight deck and removes two explosives and a detonator concealed in David's casket, then goes to the avionics section, plants and arms the explosives where a presumably drugged Julia is sleeping. It is revealed at this point that Carson, Stephanie, and the Berlin mortuary director are part of a conspiracy to hijack the aircraft for a $50 million ransom and frame Kyle as the hijacker, because of her knowledge of the aircraft. The conspirators kidnapped Julia to force Kyle to unlock the casket as she's the only one who knows the code. Carson lies to Captain Rich that Kyle is threatening to bomb the aircraft unless the ransom money is wired to a bank account and a G3 aircraft is readied upon landing. He then plans to detonate the explosives, which will kill Julia and leave Kyle dead with the detonator in her hand.\n\nAfter landing in Newfoundland, the tarmac is surrounded by U.S. FBI agents. After the passengers disembark, Kyle apologizes to Captain Rich for disrupting the flight but is certain Julia will be found. Angered, Captain Rich demands she drop the charade, stating that the ransom has been paid. Kyle realizes that Carson is the perpetrator and, assuming the role of hijacker, commands Carson to remain aboard and the crew to leave. Carson realizes he cannot refuse without giving himself away.\n\nWhen the airliner door closes, Kyle knocks Carson unconscious with a fire extinguisher, handcuffs him to a rail, and takes the detonator. Stephanie appears as Carson regains consciousness. He shoots at his cuffs to free himself. After pursuing and shooting at Kyle, she locks herself in the cockpit, and tricks Carson into thinking she has left the cockpit by throwing a binder into the attic. Meanwhile, a panicked Stephanie flees the airliner after a small altercation with Kyle.\n\nKyle finds the unconscious Julia in the avionics area and narrowly avoids Carson. He reveals that he abducted Julia and dumped her in the food bin and that David was murdered to conceal the explosives in his casket because it wasn't required to be X-rayed. Carrying Julia, Kyle escapes into the aircraft's non-combustible hold. When Carson finds Julia gone, he turns his back and taunts Kyle, who closes the hold's door behind her just as Carson starts shooting at her. She detonates the explosives, killing Carson and destroying the front landing gear but she and Julia emerged unscathed.\n\nAt an airport hangar the next morning, Captain Rich apologizes to Kyle. As a handcuffed Stephanie is led away by FBI agents, one of the escorting agents informs Kyle of the arrest of the Berlin mortuary director, asking her to identify him. She carries the still-unconscious Julia through the crowd of passengers to a waiting minivan while the passengers realize the truth. As an act of respect and forgiveness, Obaid helps Kyle load her luggage. Julia awakes and sleepily asks \"Are we there yet?\" as the minivan drives away.\n\n\nPeter A. Dowling had the idea for \"Flightplan\" in 1999 on a phone conversation with a friend. His original pitch for producer Brian Grazer involved a man who worked on airport security doing a business trip from the United States to Hong Kong, and during the flight his son went missing. A few years later, Billy Ray took over the script, taking out the terrorists from the story and putting more emphasis on the protagonist, who became a female as Grazer thought it would be a good role for Jodie Foster. The story then focused on the main character regaining her psyche, and added the post-September 11 attacks tension and paranoia. There was also an attempt to hide the identity of the villain by showcasing the different characters on the plane. Both Dowling and Ray were allowed to visit the insides of a Boeing 747 at the Los Angeles International Airport to develop the limited space on which the story takes place. The film also draws on Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Lady Vanishes\", in which an older woman goes missing on board a train and only one passenger remembers her, especially in the scene where Kyle discovers the heart drawn by her daughter on the plane window.\n\nSchwentke said that to make \"Flightplan\" as realistic as possible, he wanted naturalistic, subdued performances. One example was Peter Sarsgaard, whom he described as an actor \"who can all of a sudden become a snake uncoiling\". First-time actress Marlene Lawston became Foster's daughter Julia. Sean Bean was cast to subvert his typecasting as a villain, and mislead audiences into thinking he was part of the villainous plot. The director also picked each of the 300 passengers through auditions.\n\nSchwentke described \"Flightplan\" as a \"slow boiling\" thriller, where the opening is different from the faster ending parts. The director added that sound was used to put audiences \"off-kilter\".\n\nThe art direction team had to build all the interiors of the fictional E-474 from scratch, including the cockpit. The interior design and layout is similar to an actual airplane, the Airbus A380. It is noted that the amount of dead space within the cabin, cargo and avionic areas do not reflect the actual amount of dead space within any aircraft. BE Aerospace provided various objects to \"stage the scene\"; \"many of the interior sets used real aircraft components such as seats, gallies, etc.\"\n\nOf special note in the movie is the avionics computer seen below the cockpit and the clean space between the upper deck passenger areas and the fuselage. To allow for varied camera angles, the set had many tracks for the camera dolly to move, and both the walls and the ceiling were built on hinges so they could easily be swung open for shooting. The design and colors tried to invoke the mood for each scene - for instance, a white room for \"eerie, clinical, cold\" moments, lower ceilings for claustrophobia, and wide open spaces to give no clues to the audience. Most exterior scenes of the \"E-474\" involve a model with 1/10th of the aircraft's actual size, with the images being subsequently enhanced through computer-generated imagery. The explosion in the nose involved both life sized and scaled pieces of scenery. A one-half scale set of the avionics area was constructed to make the explosion and fireball look bigger.\n\nThe score for \"Flightplan\" was released September 20, 2005, on Hollywood Records. The music was composed and conducted by James Horner and the disc contains eight tracks. Horner stated that film's score tried to mix the sound effects with \"the emotion and drive of the music\", and the instruments were picked to match the \"feelings of panic\" Kyle goes on through the film. These included Gamelan instruments, prepared piano, and string arrangements. No brass instruments are used in the soundtrack.\n\n\"Flightplan\" opened at #1 in US and Canada, grossing over $24 million in its opening weekend. It grossed $89,707,299 at the domestic box office and $133,680,000 overseas for a worldwide total of $223,387,299. It also grossed $79,270,000 on DVD rentals.\n\nFilm historian Leonard Maltin in \"Leonard Maltin's 2012 Movie Guide\" (2011) described \"Flightplan\" as \"suspenseful at first, this thriller becomes remote and un-involving; by the climax, it's just plain ridiculous.\"\n\nAviation film historian Simon D. Beck in \"The Aircraft-Spotter's Film and Television Companion\" (2016) noted that \"Flightplan\" was careful in setting the scene. \" The aircraft is a fictional mammoth airliner called the 'E-474', a double-deck jumbo modeled strongly after the Airbus A-380, the large size being suitable for the missing-person plot of the film.\"\n\n\"Flightplan\" received mixed reviews from critics and public alike. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 38% rating based on 173 reviews from non-critics, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site's consensus states: \"The actors are all on key here, but as the movie progresses, tension deflates as the far-fetched plot kicks in.\" Metacritic, an aggregate site, reports a 53 out of 100 rating, based on 33 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nThe Association of Professional Flight Attendants called for an official boycott of \"Flightplan\", which they say depicts flight attendants as rude, uncaring, indifferent, and even one as a \"terrorist.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2008865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008865", "title": "Mateship", "text": "Mateship\n\nMateship is an Australian cultural idiom that embodies equality, loyalty and friendship. Russel Ward, in \"The Australian Legend\" (1958), saw the concept as a central one to the Australian people. \"Mateship\" derives from \"mate\", meaning \"friend\", commonly used in Australia as an amicable form of address.\n\nMateship is regarded as an Australian military virtue. For instance, the Australian Army Recruit Training Centre lists the \"soldierly qualities\" it seeks to instill as including \"a will to win, dedication to duty, honour, compassion and honesty, mateship and teamwork, loyalty, and physical and moral courage.\"\n\nThe word \"mate\" bloomed during World War I, when lots of trenches were being built because of the machine gun. Many trenches were built which often stretched miles across war grounds. The words “diggers” and “mate” gained the same meaning and became interchangeable.\n\nDuring the 1999 Australian constitutional referendum there was some consideration regarding the inclusion of the term \"mateship\" in the preamble of the Australian constitution. This proposed change was drafted by the Australian poet Les Murray, in consultation with the Prime Minister of the time, John Howard:\n\nAustralians are free to be proud of their country and heritage, free to realise themselves as individuals, and free to pursue their hopes and ideals. We value excellence as well as fairness, independence as dearly as mateship.\n\nMurray was not supportive of the inclusion of \"mateship\" in the preamble, stating that it was \"blokeish\" and \"not a real word\", but the Prime Minister insisted it be included as the term, he said, had \"a hallowed place in the Australian lexicon\". Howard reluctantly dropped the term from the preamble, after the Australian Democrats refused to allow it to be passed by the Senate where they held the balance of power.\n\nSince the referendum the Australian government has introduced the concept of mateship as a possible part of an Australian citizenship test, although it was unclear how endorsement of the values of mateship would be tested.\n\nMateship is a concept that can be traced back to early colonial times. The harsh environment in which convicts and new settlers found themselves meant that men and women closely relied on each other for all sorts of help. In Australia, a 'mate' is more than just a friend and is a term that implies a sense of shared experience, mutual respect and unconditional assistance.\n\nThe term includes use in ways other than friendship like getting someone's attention, replacing a name, questioning a statement, letting one know to calm down and referring to someone in a rash or harsh way. The use of such in a harsh or negative way can be traced back to the word \"bastard\". Around the 16th century, the word \"mate\" adopted a similar meaning. Only within the last two centuries, has the term connected itself with a meaning of friendship.\n\n\n\n"}

MIME transfer encoding of UTF-8 makes it either unreadable as a plain text (in the case of base64) or, for some languages and types of text, heavily size inefficient (in the case of quoted-printable). \n\nSome document formats, such as HTML, PostScript and Rich Text Format have their own 7-bit encoding schemes for non-ASCII characters and can thus be sent without using any special email encodings. E.g. HTML email can use HTML entities to use characters from anywhere in Unicode even if the HTML source text for the email is in a legacy encoding (e.g. 7-bit ASCII). For details of this see Unicode and HTML.\n\n\n"}

His grandfather „Boley der Rüd genannt Anshelm“ had fought on the side of the \"Eidgenossen\" in the Burgundy Wars. After studies in Kraków (1493–95) and Tübingen (until 1499) he spent some time as a travelling scholar (in 1501, he was in Lyon). He then settled in Bern, where he was appointed on 22 August 1505 the headmaster of the Latin school. In 1508, he became the city physician.\n\nAs a sympathizer of the Reformation, he corresponded with reformers such as Zwingli and Vadian. A critical remark of his wife on the veneration of Mary earned him a reprimand by the city council and a substantial pay cut in 1523, and as a consequence the family moved to Rottweil two years later. However, there he got involved in the conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, too, and even spent some time in jail. When the Protestants were banned from Rottweil in 1529, he more than gladly followed a call of Bern (which had become Protestant in 1528) to serve as the city's chronicler. From 1535 to 1537 he again served also as the city physician. He died between 1 August 1546 and 21 February 1547; the exact date is unknown.\n\nAnshelm's appointment as chronicler was based on his having written a Latin chronicle of world history already during his first stay in Bern. Written in 1510, it was not printed until 1540, but Anshelm had distributed handwritten copies before. His main opus, however, was the \"Berner Chronik\", a history of the city of Bern on which he worked in his position as city chronicler until his death. After a brief introduction to the early history, it covered especially the time from the Burgundy Wars until 1536, although only fragments of the period of 1526 to 1536 survived. It remained buried in the municipal archives of Bern and was thus not widely known until the 17th century, when Michael Stettler was commissioned to continue Anshelm's work. Stettler's own \"Schweizerchronik\", a history of Switzerland that was based on Anshelm's work, appeared first in 1626.\n\n"}

{"id": "2008924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008924", "title": "French immersion", "text": "French immersion\n\nFrench immersion is a form of bilingual education in which students, who do not speak French as first language will receive instruction in French. In most French-immersion schools, students will learn to speak French and learn most subjects such as history, music, geography, math, art, physical education and science in French. Most school boards in Ontario offer French Immersion starting in grade one and others start as early as senior kindergarten. With the TDSB French immersion is offered starting in senior kindergarten. At the primary level, students will receive instructions in French at a hundred percent of their instructional day. English instruction is introduced in grade 4, and the minutes of English instruction will increase throughout their educational career with up to fifty percent of English/French instruction daily.\n\nFrench immersion programming spread rapidly from its original start in Canada in the 1960s. French Immersion education is optional and not compulsory. Parents have the choice in sending their children to schools that offer such programming. Students are encouraged to begin communicating in French as consistently as possible. Teachers in French Immersion schools are competent in speaking French, having acquired specific French as a Second Language qualifications to teach all subjects in French. Classroom communication of French in French Immersion programs is meaningful and authentic for students. Learning French becomes subconscious and there is a strong focus on understanding before speaking. Most students that enroll in French Immersion programs are not experts in French and lack experience in it. Students in French Immersion programs complete the same core curriculum subjects as students in the Core program.\n\nThe French Immersion was designed to: (a) capitalize on children's ability to learn language naturally and effortlessly; (b) take advantage of their social ability and open attitudes to language and culture; (c) reflect on the building blocks of language by emphasizing the use of languages for communication and (d) not stopping the children from participating in native language development, academic achievement or general cognitive development.\n\n\nThe age an individual begins the French Immersion program varies:\n\n\nThe amount of time French Immersion students spend in immersion varies:\n\n\nA study shows that French immersion might improve academic performance.\n\nStudents participate in French Immersion programs to gain employability-related skills and to increase job opportunities.\n\nStudents in French Immersion demonstrate a superior level of mental flexibility, which is an ability to think more independently of words and to have a higher awareness of concept formation as well as a more diversified intelligence than students in the regular program.\n\nData illustrates that students in French Immersion programs also have a linguistic advantage as they are able to adopt two different perspectives, offering alternative ways to look at the same information.\n\nFrench Immersion students also have a deeper appreciation and respect for various cultures. In addition, they also gain more fulfillment in learning a new language.\n\nStudents in French immersion programs also have greater opportunity to understand their own culture or their own nation. For example, Canada's identity is based on the fact that it holds two official languages, English and French. French Immersion students have the opportunity to gain a greater understanding of what it means to be Canadian through the French Immersion program.\n\nMany challenges in participating in French Immersion programs subsist. For example, many French Immersion students do not reach native-like language proficiency in French. This could be due, in part, to the fact that there is a lack of willingness on the part of French Immersion students to communicate in French outside of the classroom. This lack of willingness may stem from students not feeling prepared or equipped to practice the language.\n\nAccess to Special Education resources is often restricted to students in French Immersion and as such, it is often suggested to parents that they switch their children to a regular English stream in order to access the support that their child requires. Suggesting that exceptional students would be better off without the French Immersion program and that resources are not available in the program would be ignorant and misinformed. French Immersion teachers could go through professional development training and courses about special education integration into their programs, all while creating referral processes for special education in French Immersion with parent involvement as an aim. When the rights of children to special education are overlooked, consequences can be costly to students' futures.\n\nFrench Immersion students from elementary schools often experience difficulties when entering a high school which provides the full curriculum in English only. This often leads to problems with \"both language and subject matter gaps in their learning\", according to a Toronto Star report. Students who do have access to a high school with French instruction may feel overwhelmed with having to learn heavy content in mathematics and science in their second language. Teachers in such schools can be equally overwhelmed with being restricted to using only French in these contexts, and may experience guilt when English is used in their classrooms to reinforce vocabulary and complex concepts. Some experts recommend debate within school boards and ministries about allowing the use of English in French Immersion contexts when teaching complex concepts in mathematics and science.\n\nIt is extremely difficult for school boards in Canada to hire teachers who are fully fluent in French and also have experience and evidence of excellent teaching skills in the various subjects that they must teach in Elementary schools, for example. A school board in the Greater Toronto Area reported in 2017 that 80% of principals recently reported finding it extremely difficult to hire French-speaking teachers of the same caliber as the English-speaking staff. In fact, in November 2017, the Halton Catholic District School Board was considering an end to their French Immersion program for this reason. Some experts have suggested that research be conducted to seek strategies for French teacher recruitment to alleviate staff shortages in Canadian schools. Scholarship and bursary programs for prospective Bachelor of Education students to gain French teaching qualifications are also suggested to alleviate these shortages. The province of Ontario planned to open its first university where classes will be taught exclusively in French and this may alleviate the staffing problems eventually. By late 2017, the final recommendations from a planning board had been submitted to the government.\n\nA report, by a PhD candidate scholar in educational policy at the University of Toronto, also discussed concerns about French immersion creating a dual track academic stream in many schools. She referred to a system \"where the smart, motivated kids are funnelled into French, and everyone else gets left behind in English\" which can become viewed as the \"de facto low track stream\". The author discussed a study at a Vancouver school, published in the British Journal of Sociology of Education, which concluded that \"French immersion programmes operate as a 'cream-skimming' phenomenon … [that] allows white, middle class parents to access markers of higher social status and prestige.\"\n\nA report by the Canadian Council on Learning spoke on the failure of many students to learn French: \"Although most Canadian school children are taught English or French as a second language in school, these lessons often fail to yield functional bilingualism. For example, New Brunswick’s French Second Language Commission recently reported that fewer than 1% of the students who enrolled in \"core French\" in 1994 had met the provincial minimum goal by 2007. And fewer than 10% of students who enrolled in early-French immersion in 1995 had attained the provincial goal by 2007.\"\n\nThe \"Agence pour l'enseignement français à l'étranger\" (AEFE) runs or funds 470 schools worldwide, with French as the primary language of instruction in most schools.\n\nFrench immersion is used in Australian schools such as Benowa State High School and The Southport School; teaching mathematics, SOSE, science and French, entirely in French.\n\nThere is also a French immersion program offered at Methodist Ladies' College and Mansfield State High School teaching a variety of subjects over three years in French.\n\nTelopea Park School in Canberra is a bilingual French-English school.\n\nThe program is also offered at The Glennie School in Toowoomba, Queensland.\n\nLycée Condorcet in Maroubra, Sydney teaches almost entirely in French and conforms to the French government system, enabling students to easily transition to and from France to the school.\n\nFrench immersion programs were introduced into Canadian schools in the 1960s to encourage bilingualism across the country. Now immersion programs provide an alternative education stream for many students. Since their implementation, French immersion programs have become increasingly popular across Canada and school districts have seen significant increased enrolment in their French immersion student population over the years.\n\nFrench immersion programs are offered in most Anglophone public school districts. French immersion is also done in some private schools and preschools.\n\nSeveral Canadian universities offer opportunities for students to continue to study subjects in either French or English, such as Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, the University of Alberta Faculté Saint-Jean in Edmonton, the Université de Moncton in New Brunswick, the Université Sainte-Anne in Nova Scotia, the Université de Saint-Boniface of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, University of Ottawa, Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, York University's Glendon College in Toronto and HEC Montréal in Montreal.\n\nFrench-immersion programs are offered in all ten Canadian provinces. French popularity differs by province and region. Currently, enrollment in French immersion is highest in Quebec, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and lowest in Saskatchewan. Western Canada, which is predominantly Anglophone, is experiencing high population growth, and has seen significant increases in the proportion of French immersion students.\n\nWalker Road Primary School, Aberdeen, Scotland started an early partial immersion program in 2000. Also, Judgemeadow Community College, Evington, in Leicester, has been using a French Immersion course in one form group a year for the last four years. Pupils answer the register in French, and their French, IT and PHSE lessons are all in French. The Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle (originally Lycée Français de Londres) is a French school transported to England and as such the vast majority of the teaching is in French and caters to French curricula and indeed, as far as quatrième (at the age of 13-14), all pupils are taught entirely in French.\n\nPrivate French language immersion schools in the United States have existed since at least the 1950s. Most of these schools receive help from the AEFE. There are currently almost 40 of these schools in the United States.\n\nPublic school districts have run French immersion programs since 1974.\n\n\nThe southern part of Louisiana has a strong French heritage extending back to colonial times. During the mid-twentieth century, however, the number of native French speakers plunged as French was banned in public schools and children punished for speaking it. The social stigma associated with speaking French was sufficiently strong that many parents did not speak the language to their children, so generations born in the second half of the century rarely spoke French in the home. As a result, French immersion is today viewed by parents and educators as a way to save the French language in Louisiana, where there are more French immersion programs than in any other state.\n\nIn 2008, an editorial in the \"Vancouver Sun\" criticized French immersion programs for having become a way for higher socioeconomic groups to obtain a publicly funded elite track education. Since lower socioeconomic groups and children with learning and behavioral problems have lower rates of participation in French immersion, a situation has developed in which ambitious families might prefer French immersion for its effective streaming than for the bilingual skills it gives to students.\n\nEnrolment in French Immersion programs has become difficult for immigrants to Canada, because it is argued by school administrators and board professionals that learning English as a second language presents enough of a challenge for students. The lack of accessibility to French Immersion programs for English Language Learners is very similar to that for students with special needs.\nAs a result, the media places blame on Canada's immigrants for the declining number of bilingual citizens in Canada, while the immigrant community continues to pursue opportunities to become bilingual. It is suggested that Canada's education system provide more opportunities to immigrants to become bilingual in order to increase the number of official bilingual Canadians.\n\n"}

Culture polity traditions, language, food costume, belief system, architecture, arts, craft, music, dance, and sports which will be discussed in this article to give you an indication of Fiji's indigenous community but also the various communities which make up Fiji as a modern culture and living. The indigenous culture is an active and living part of everyday life for the majority of the population.\n\nFijian culture has evolved with the introduction of Indian, Chinese and European culture, and various cultures from the Pacific neighbors of Fiji; in particular the Tongan and Rotuman cultures. The culture of Fiji, including language, has created a unique communal and national identity.\n\nFijian indigenous society is very communal, with great importance attached to the family unit, the village, and the \"vanua\" (land). A hierarchy of chiefs presides over villages, clans, and tribes. Chiefly positions are hereditary; a deceased chief is invariably followed by a kinsman or kinswoman, though not necessarily his own son or daughter. This reflects Polynesian influence: in most other Melanesian societies, chiefs are appointed on merit.\n\nThe largest social unit for Fijians is the \"Yavusa\", defined by R.A. Derrick as the \"direct agnate descendants of a single kalou-vu\" (deified ancestor). Chiefly succession was from older brother/sister to younger brother/sister, after the death of their father/mother. When the youngest brother/sister died, the eldest son/daughter of the eldest brother/sister became chief. This tradition still influences Fijian society today, though less rigidly: there is more of a tendency nowadays towards primogeniture.\n\nEach brother/sister in the family then formed his own branch of the yavusa, called the \"Mataqali\". Each mataqali became the custodian of a specific task. A fully developed Yavusa has several mataqali:\n\n\nThe mataqali are subdivided into \"Tokatoka\", each comprising closely related families.\n\nSeveral mataqali comprise a village, several of which form a yavusa or district. The British colonial rulers amalgamated the districts into \"Yasana\", or Provinces. The districts also form three \"Matanitu\", or \"Confederacies.\" These are often said to be agglomerations of provinces, but as the latter were a colonial imposition, the boundaries do not coincide exactly, and the Provinces of Tailevu, Ra, Naitasiri, Lomaiviti and parts of Yasawa and Ba makes the Kubuna Confederacy. This Confederacy in modern Fiji is considered to be the most senior. The other two are Burebasaga (covering the rest of Viti Levu), and Tovata, covering Vanua Levu, Lau archipelago and Rotuma. Despite its isolation and relatively small size, Tovata has been politically dominant since Fiji gained its independence in 1970.\n\nEnglish, Fijian (based on the speech of Bau Island), and Hindustani are the official languages of Fiji. The Fijian language has many dialects, and there is a clear distinction between the dialects of the West, Central and Eastern parts of the country.\n\nOther languages spoken in the country are Fiji Hindi, Cantonese, Rotuman, Gilbertese (Rabi Island), and Tuvaluan (Kioa Island). The Fiji Islands are traditionally linked to their island neighbours Rotuma, Tonga and Samoa, and this is evident in the culture and dialects of the Northern and Eastern provinces being Cakaudrove, Bua, Macuata, and Lau. The many dialects spoken in these four provinces consistently use sounds that are heard in Tongan and Samoan, but not so with dialects from the Western and South Western parts of Fiji. The Fijian language uses a Latin alphabet. However, the Fijian alphabet is dissimilar from the English alphabet. The following conventions exist:\n\nIn Fijian words, each vowel is given its full weight and never shortened, skipped or slurred.\n\nThe existence of many dialects within the Fijian language as well as exposure to the other languages spoken has contributed to many Fiji Islanders being bilingual. For general communication in an informal environment, a very interesting cross use of the languages has developed, resulting in slang now commonly referred to as Fiji English, although in formal settings, correct usage is adhered to. Fiji English comprises aspects of Fijian, English and Hindi, which reflects the history and identity of the people of Fiji.\n\nFiji English is non-rhotic.\n\nThe vowel sounds for Fiji English are:\n\nFiji English recordings can be found here.\n\nIn culture, its various crafts and music give it an identity along with it traditional etiquette and varying forms of clothing attire, its unique architecture also tells a story of a culture and its evolution, the following will discuss these aspects of culture in Fiji.\n\nFiji's arts and crafts reflect local adaptations of their Polynesian and Melanesian heritage. By tradition, the men's and women's crafts are separate.\n\nThe village of Na lotu on Kadavu Island is famous for its pottery, the making of which is still governed by strict rituals. Nadroga and Rewa also produce fine pottery. Each region has its own unique style in the making of pottery.\n\nThe making of \"Tapa cloth\", or \"(masi)\", is another craft associated with women. Tapa is made from the bark of the paper mulberry tree and decorated in charcoal with symbolic motifs and various patterns. In modern times, it has become fashionable for a \"masi\" to bear the name of the person who made it. \"Masi\" are often exchanged as gifts on formal occasions. The island of Vatuelele of the southern coast of Viti Levu is famous for its \"masi\" products.\n\nMost Fijian mats are made from the leaves of the pandanus tree. The long process of preparation includes scraping and boiling the leaves, and drying them in the sun. There are different mats used for different occasions, and some are made as gifts for formal occasions such as weddings. Most mats are bordered with highly decorative and brightly coloured wool. One well-known Fijian mat is the kuta, made by women in Vanua Levu, particularly Bua.\n\nWeaving using various materials was another craft generally mastered by the women but also aspects of weaving were mastered only by the men, various types of weaving practiced were and still are; basket weaving, coconut rope weaving, and coconut leaves weaving.\n\nCarving was practiced by the men; carving would be used for items of practical use and simple shapes and design were used. A lot of effort was put into well adorned weapons and items for the home and ceremony, today carving is practiced for its use in tourism and no longer plays a major role in Fijian society and life except in the case of the tanoa used for drinking kava.\nCanoe building was another art practiced only by the men. Canoes were not only the major form of communication, but were important in all aspects of Fijian society, from the gathering of food and transporting of crops to use in presentation ceremonies and they were instrumental in wars and politics which were rife in Fiji. The art of canoe building was varied across the group and had several different types but of a similar design. The camakau was a small twin-hulled canoe for fishing or small transportation purposes. The most impressive canoes in Fiji were that of the Drua. In Fiji's early history before European involvement, control of the seaways was a major and decisive objective; disrupting or cutting off the enemies supply and reinforcements gave great advantage in battle and would ensure victory. Sea battles involving hundreds of canoes were frequent. The canoe, which inspired fear and awe and so often held the balance was the mighty Drua. One of the most elaborate and beautiful artifacts of Oceania, the Drua was a product of considerable group efforts and human sacrifice. Double hulled and of gigantic proportions, the Drua was a masterpiece of design and craftsmanship, requiring total community involvement in its construction and human sacrifice in its launching. Its speed out at sea would be in excess of twenty knots and still remained highly manoeuvrable, it was capable of carrying upward of 150 warriors and took some 6 to 7 years to build and would vary in length from 100 feet to 118 feet and have a mast height of 60 to 70 feet, in the mid-19th century the following accounts were recorded:\n\n\"\"Up went the huge sail, down went the great steering oars, splashing into the sea, and away we shot like a racehorse. Owing to the great rate at which we were going, the sea was like a hissing cauldron on either side of our course, and the vessel, instead of having time to mount over the smaller waves, cut its way through them.\"\" (West, 1869).\n\n\"\"It had a magnificent appearance with its immense sail of white mats; its velocity was almost inconceivable.\"\" (Wilkes, 1840).\n\nRatu Seru Cakobau commanded an impressive fleet which had Several Drua with armed warriors ready for battle the led Canoe was named 'Rusi I Vanua' or 'Cursed is the land'.\nMuch of the art of Canoe building has been lost and only a small few still practice the art on a very small scale as its use in this modern era seems to have lost its place. The craft of Canoe building was traditionally reserved for the male.\n\nAn indigenous art form is the Meke, which may incorporate the seasea (women's fan dance) or a meke wesi (men's spear dance). It is usually a narrative of an important event such as a war, a chiefly installation, or even a scandal. Some \"mekes\" are generations old, and form an important part of Fiji's oral history. In olden times, the \"meke\" was considered to be an oracle from the gods, and the \"Dau ni vucu\", or composer, would often go into a trance before a performance. Others are modern, composed for a particular event, much as a poet laureate might write a poem to celebrate an event in a Western country.\n\nEach district of Fiji has its own form of \"meke,\" performed in the local dialect. Other forms of Polynesian and Melanesian dance art forms exist with most widely known being dances of Rotuma and Tonga. There are also various Indian dances and Chinese dances which are performed at relevant festivals marking important times for these communities which are now a part of Culture in Fiji.\n\nMusic of Old Fiji consisted of various chants which often told a story or preserved information to be passed on from generation to generation, these songs used various traditional instruments.\n\nWith the introduction of European and Asian cultures music in Fiji has evolved and songs sung in the Fijian vernacular are popular but so also are songs in Indian and English, some local artists mix all three languages and traditional instruments from each culture making for a very interesting musical experience. A distinct Indian sound has evolved in Fiji that some see as influencing modern Indian music and even jazz.\n\nThe traditional attire was loin cloths for men and grass skirts for women. Skirts were short for single women, and long for married women, with girls wearing virgin locks before marriage. Most females had the lower parts of their bodies decorated with tattoos after their first menstruation, as an initiation from girlhood into womanhood. Chiefs dressed more elaborately.\n\nModern Fiji's national dress is the \"sulu\", which resembles a skirt. It is commonly worn by both men and women. One type worn by both men and women is the 'Sulu vaka Toga' pronounced Sulu vakah Tonga which is a wrap around piece of rectangular material which is elaborately decorated with patterns and designs of varying styles this is for more casual and informal occasions. Many men, especially in urban areas, also have \"Sulu vaka taga\" which is a tailored sulu and can be tailored as part of their suit. Many will wear a shirt with a western-style collar, tie, and jacket, with a matching \"Sulu vaka taga\" and sandals, this type of sulu can be worn to a semi formal or formal occasion. Even the military uniforms have incorporated the \"Sulu vaka taga\" as part of their ceremonial dress.\n\nWomen usually wear a multi-layered \"Tapa cloth\" on formal occasions. A blouse made of cotton, silk, or satin, of often worn on top. On special occasions, women often wear a \"tapa\" sheath across the chest, rather than a blouse. On other occasions, women may be dressed in a \"chamba\", also known as a \"sulu i ra\", a \"sulu\" with a specially crafted matching top.\n\nThere are many regional variations throughout Fiji. Residents of the village of Dama, in Bua Province Fiji wear finely woven mats called \"kuta\", made from a reed.\n\nWhile traditional and semi-traditional forms of dress are still very much in use amongst indigenous Fijian culture, there is a greater influence for Western and Indian Fashion in urban areas as in neighboring developed nations.\n\nEtiquette in indigenous Fijian ceremony is rather intricate depending on the function as various formalities and presentations which do several things; firstly it shows respect between two communal groups, strengthen tribal and family ties and reinforce social, tribal and family ties. Various items are used in ceremony and surrounded by ceremony, Kava, known in Fiji as \"yaqona\", is Fiji's national drink. Traditionally, it was used only in important ceremonies. Nowadays, it is a social beverage. There is a strict protocol associated with \"yaqona\" drinking. One should clap once, clasping the hands, take the cup, and drink the \"yaqona\" in a single draft before returning the cup to the bearer. Another highly prized item in ceremony is the tabua or Whale's tooth, other items also the use of tapa cloth (\"masi\") and mats are also used traditionally in ceremony. In modern day, practices such as the bulubulu ceremony (which acts as a mediation between two people, a victim and offender) will incorporate the kava and tabua into the ritual. Also various regions have tradition that has been passed down generation to generation for centuries one example are the firewalkers of beqa. The Sawau tribe of Beqa are noted for their ability to walk on white hot stones without being burned. Strict rituals have to be observed before the firewalking ceremony. There is an ancient myth about how an ancestor of the Sawau tribe was given this power by a spirit god in exchange for his life, after the god was captured by the man who was fishing for eels.\n\nThe cuisine of Fiji in pre-colonial times consisted of root crops, vegetables, and fruits, as well as various land animals such as wild pig, and various birds. The coastal tribes would have had the same, but also had a large amount of local seafood. These would have been prepared with local herbs and spices on wood fire rock ovens. Most cooking areas were located in the center of house so the smoke would repel insects and strengthen the roof thatching. Another popular method of cooking, which is still used today, is the \"lovo\" which is an earth oven — a fire made on in a pit in the ground lined with heat-resistant stones. It closely resembles the hangi of the New Zealand Māori. When the stones are hot, food wrapped in (banana) leaves are placed in the pit, covered with soil and left to cook before being exhumed and eaten. Dishes cooked this way include \"palusami\", parcels of taro leaves saturated with coconut milk, onions, and sometimes tinned meat.\n\nModern Fijian Cuisine is rather diverse with great influence from Indian cuisine and spices. When these are applied to local traditional dishes, it makes for interesting eating. European, Indian, and Chinese variants of cuisine, along with traditional foods, are commonplace in most, if not all households in Fiji.\n\nIn Old Fiji, the architecture of villages was simple and practical to meet the physical and social need and to provide communal safety. The houses were square in shape and with pyramid like shaped roofs, and the walls and roof were thatched and various plants of practical use were planted nearby, each village having a meeting house and a Spirit house. The spirit house was elevated on a pyramid like base built with large stones and earth, again a square building with an elongated pyramid like roof with various scented flora planted nearby.\n\nThe houses of Chiefs were of similar design and would be set higher than his subjects houses but instead of an elongated roof would have similar roof to those of his subjects homes but of course on a larger scale.\n\nWith the introduction of communities from Asia aspects of their cultural architecture are now evident in urban and rural areas of Fiji's two main Islands Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. A village structure shares similarities today but built with modern materials and spirit houses (Bure Kalou) have been replaced by churches of varying design.\n\nThe urban landscape of early Colonial Fiji was reminiscent of most British colonies of the 19th and 20th century in tropical regions of the world, while some of this architecture remains, the urban landscape is evolving in leaps and bounds with various modern aspects of architecture and design becoming more and more evident in the business, industrial and domestic sector, the rural areas are evolving at a much slower rate.\n\nThe emergence of Fiji's literature (as distinct from oral literature) coincides with the country's transition to independence in 1970. Among the first published works of Fijian literature, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, were Raymond Pillai's short stories (in English) and Pio Manoa's poetry (in English and in Fijian). More recent notable Fiji writers include Satendra Nandan (poet and novelist), Sudesh Mishra (poet), Larry Thomas (playwright), and Joseph Veramo (novelist).\n\nReligion is quite diverse with Christianity being the dominant faith in Fiji. Many Christian denominations are present in Fiji, the most prevalent of which is Methodist. Of the other Asian religions the Hindu faith is dominant, followed by Islam. There are other belief systems observed by Fijians as well.\n\nThe impact of Christianity in the 19th century resulted in certain traditions being proscribed. In the pre-Christian era, human sacrifice was practiced. Men were buried alive to hold the pillars to the house of a chief. Cannibalism was practiced, too: the bodies of enemies slain in battle, or in sacrifice, were piled up and cooked for festivals, such as the installation of chiefs or the launching of a great canoe. Seru Epenisa Cakobau, the Bauan warlord who united the disparate tribes of Fiji and proclaimed himself King in 1871, renounced cannibalism on his conversion to Christianity in 1854.\nFiji's old religion is no longer practiced by the majority in the indigenous community who have adopted Christianity. Old deities are still acknowledged and respected, but not worshipped. Fijian rituals still exist in private.\n\nOf the various faiths, Christianity is the dominant belief system and including all the various denominations of the Christian faith they number in total 449,482. Hindus, with their various denominations, number in total 261,097. Muslims make up 54,324 of Fiji's population. Followers of other belief systems make up 10,166 of Fiji's population.\n\nSports culture is unique as different racial mixes and cultures come together in a common interest. Fiji is fanatical about sports, the two most dominant being rugby and soccer.\n\nSports in older times had a practical place, apart from recreation, helping to train young warriors. One such practice would have the older men bring the male children a severely injured captive of war, allowing the boys to practice their archery skills against this living target. There were other sports that were practiced in older times which are not practiced now. Notable traditional sports used to be played were \"tiqa\", \"ulutoa\", \"veisaga\", and \"veisolo\".\n\nSports have developed greatly over the past two decades in Fiji with a wide variety of sports undertaken. Fiji is most well known for its prowess in the game of rugby union and in particular rugby sevens.\n\nRugby union is the most popular sport in Fiji. The highest level of competition is the Colonial Cup. The Fiji national rugby union team has competed in five Rugby World Cup competitions. The Fijian Rugby Sevens team is constantly one of the top two or three teams in the world, often the premier team.\n\nRugby league is a popular team sport played in Fiji. The Fiji national rugby league team is known as \"Fiji Bati\", with the team competing in three Rugby League World Cup competitions. They made it to the semi-finals of the 2008 Rugby League World Cup.\n\nSoccer was a minor sport, but over the last decade with further international funding from FIFA and sound local management of the sport has grown in popularity amongst the Indian community initially but now also the Fijian community.\n\nMany other sports have a following. Vijay Singh has been a world champion in golf, as has Tony Philps in surfing. Cricket, Sailing of varying forms, various adventure sports, athletics, martial arts and boxing are all popular.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2008939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008939", "title": "Drive-by download", "text": "Drive-by download\n\nDrive-by download means two things, each concerning the unintended download of computer software from the Internet:\n\n\nDrive-by downloads may happen when visiting a website, opening an e-mail attachment or clicking a link, or clicking on a deceptive pop-up window: by clicking on the window in the mistaken belief that, for example, an error report from the computer's operating system itself is being acknowledged or a seemingly innocuous advertisement pop-up is being dismissed. In such cases, the \"supplier\" may claim that the user \"consented\" to the download, although the user was in fact unaware of having started an unwanted or malicious software download. Similarly if a person is visiting a site with malicious content, the person may become victim to a drive-by download attack. That is, the malicious content may be able to exploit vulnerabilities in the browser or plugins to run malicious code without the user’s knowledge.\n\nA drive-by install (or installation) is a similar event. It refers to installation rather than download (though sometimes the two terms are used interchangeably).\n\nWhen creating a drive-by download, an attacker must first create their malicious content to perform the attack. With the rise in exploit packs that contain the vulnerabilities needed to carry out drive-by download attacks, the skill level needed to perform this attack has been reduced. \n\nThe next step is to host the malicious content that the attacker wishes to distribute. One option is for the attacker to host the malicious content on their own server. However, because of the difficulty in directing users to a new page, it may also be hosted on a compromised legitimate website, or a legitimate website unknowingly distributing the attackers content through a third party service (e.g. an advertisement). When the content is loaded by the client, the attacker will analyze the fingerprint of the client in order to tailor the code to exploit vulnerabilities specific to that client. \n\nFinally, the attacker exploits the necessary vulnerabilities to launch the drive-by download attack. Drive-by downloads usually use one of two strategies. The first strategy is exploiting API calls for various plugins. For example, the DownloadAndInstall API of the Sina ActiveX component did not properly check its parameters and allowed the downloading and execution of arbitrary files from the internet. The second strategy involves writing shellcode to memory, and then exploiting vulnerabilities in the web browser or plugin to divert the control flow of the program to the shell code. After the shellcode has been executed, the attacker can perform further malicious activities. This often involves downloading and installing malware, but can be anything, including stealing information to send back to the attacker.\n\nThe attacker may also take measures to prevent detection throughout the attack. One method is to rely on the obfuscation of the malicious code. This can be done through the use of IFrames. Another method is to encrypt the malicious code to prevent detection. Generally the attacker encrypts the malicious code into a ciphertext, then includes the decryption method after the ciphertext.\n\nDetection of drive-by download attacks is an active area of research. Some methods of detection involve anomaly detection, which tracks for state changes on a user’s computer system while the user visits a webpage. This involves monitoring the user’s computer system for anomalous changes when a web page is rendered. Other methods of detection include detecting when malicious code (shellcode) is written to memory by an attacker’s exploit. Another detection method is to make run-time environments that allow JavaScript code to run and track its behavior while it runs. Other detection methods include examining contents of HTML pages to identify features that can be used to identify malicious web pages, and using characteristics of web servers to determine if a page is malicious. Some antivirus tools use static signatures to match patterns of malicious scripts, although these are not very effective because of obfuscation techniques. Detection is also possible by using low-interaction or high-interaction honeyclients.\n\nDrive-by downloads can also be prevented from occurring by using script-blockers such as NoScript, which can easily be added into browsers such as Firefox. Using such a script-blocker, the user can disable all the scripts in a given webpage, and then selectively re-enable individual scripts on a one-by-one basis in order to determine which ones are truly necessary for webpage functionality. In this way, a whitelist of acceptable scripts can quickly be developed, which in turn facilitates convenient, safe, and efficient browsing of other websites. Such script-blocking also saves time and bandwidth (hence money) for the user, because scripts that load advertising (especially targeted ads) and invade the user's privacy (via tracking and profiling) no longer constitute a personal drain on the user and his/her resources.\n\n"}

The mountain receives over of snow annually, with a season from early December until mid-April. Half of the terrain is rated as advanced, and 15% is rated beginner.\n\nMt. Ashland is a community-focused ski area that is owned and operated by the non-profit Mt. Ashland Association. Mt. Ashland is dedicated to providing an outstanding alpine recreation experience for people of all ages and skill levels. To help meet its mission, Mt. Ashland offers the popular After School Youth Program which offers low-cost and free instruction to local youth. The 7,500' Crew Internship program also offers young people an opportunity to grow and develop at the ski area.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the mountain was a popular destination for local back country ski enthusiasts, some of whom built the lodge and one lift in 1963. In the 1970s, the area was managed by the Southern Oregon College Foundation (now Southern Oregon University) until it was purchased by Dick Hicks, a local businessman, in 1977. In 1983, the ski area was sold to Harbor Properties of Seattle, the owners of Stevens Pass Ski Area. Two new lifts were built during their ownership and night skiing lights were installed. In 1991, the City of Ashland purchased the ski resort through a community fundraising campaign and a grant from the Oregon Economic Development Fund. The slogan of the community fundraising campaign was \"Save Mount Ashland.\"\n\nIn 1929 the City of Ashland got the Forest Service to agree that the city would participate in any forest management that might impact water quality of the Ashland Creek watershed, the city's main municipal water supply.\n\nThroughout the 1940s and 1950s backcountry skiing on Mount Ashland grew in popularity among local residents, prompting some to envision a developed ski area.\n\nDuring 1961 to 1963, the Mount Ashland Corporation raised money to clear trees, grade terrain, build roads, and develop a ski area. It includes a ski lodge, the Ariel chairlift, a T-bar lift, and a rope tow on the north face of the mountain. Medford businessman Glenn Jackson provided more than half of the $120,000 that financed construction of the lodge.\n\nIn 1970, after three consecutive years of winter drought deprived the mountain of adequate snowfall to continue operations, the Mount Ashland Corporation folded. The Southern Oregon College Foundation took over management the ski area after the people of Jackson County financed the purchase of ski area resources in the first of two public bailouts in the operation's history.\n\nIn 1975, the City of Ashland signed a new Memorandum of Understanding with USFS in which the city agreed to hire consultants to monitor conditions in the Ashland Creek watershed and USFS agreed to implement any measures necessary to maintain watershed quality.\n\nIn 1977, Dick Hicks purchased the ski area from Jackson County and incorporated it as Ski Ashland, Inc.\n\nIn 1978, Ski Ashland installed the Windsor chairlift. The monitoring effort led by USFS Ashland district ranger, Glendon Jefferies, observed the East Fork of Ashland Creek flowing \"a solid reddish brown\" below the ski area. Jefferies wrote to Ski Ashland in 1978, \"The Mount Ashland Ski Area is a major source of sediment pollution in the East Fork of Ashland Creek.\" A 1979 report by James Montgomery to the city administrator made a similar finding.\n\nIn 1983, Harbor Properties of Seattle purchased Ski Ashland from Hicks. Over the next four years, Harbor developed on-slope lighting, a vehicle shop, and the Sonnet and Comer chair lifts.\n\nDrought struck again in 1988–1991 and skier use declined. In 1991 a grassroots effort raised two million dollars to save Mount Ashland from bankruptcy. Money for the purchase came from donor restricted contributions and a grant from the Oregon Economic Development Fund channeled through the City of Ashland. The city accepted donated funds and purchased Ski Ashland from Harbor Properties. The city then hired Mount Ashland Association (MAA), a newly formed non-profit corporation, to maintain and operate the ski area.\n\nIn 1992, the City of Ashland entered a lease agreement with MAA. The lease expires on June 30, 2017, with an option to be renewed or terminated. From 2005 through 2008, the City and MAA had a series of legal disputes, which were resolved with the City relinquishing the Special Use Permit to MAA with certain requirements to protect the Ashland Watershed.\n\nMt. Ashland hosted the Oregon Interscholastic Racing Association high school state championships in 2007 and 2016.\n\nThe Mt. Ashland Association continues to manage the ski area for the benefit for the entire community. Numerous programs benefiting the community include the 7,500' Crew teen internship program, the deeply-discounted After School Youth Program, the ACCESS Ski & Ride for Hunger day, and the Women of Winter program.\n\nThe ski area attempted to expand its terrain and add lifts in the 1990s. The proposal is still being debated and is well documented in the Mount Ashland Ski Area Expansion article.\n\nMount Ashland is a popular destination in summer for hiking, mountain biking, and sightseeing. The southernmost stretch of the Pacific Crest Trail in Oregon skirts the south and east sides of the mountain. The Mt. Ashland Hillclimb Run starts in Lithia Park near downtown Ashland and runners run up a series of Forest Service roads and trails to the summit of Mt. Ashland: \"13+ miles long, 1 mile up.\" The Jean Chinn Memorial Mount Ashland Hill Climb Race is a hill climb, and a combination road and mountain bike race, starting from the town of Ashland and ending at the Mount Ashland ski area parking lot, with a different route for road and mountain bikes. The \"Siskiyou Out Back\" is a set of 3 races: a 15 kilometer (9.3 mi) trail run and 50 kilometer (31 mi) and 50 mile (80.5k) ultramarathon trail runs, starting and ending at the Mount Ashland ski area parking lot. Finally, the Mt. Ashland 5K Trail Run, \"America's Friendliest 5K,\" begins in the ski area parking lot, with runners ascending to the summit and returning to the parking lot via a series of roads leading down from the summit.\n\nThe peak is also the site of the transmitter and antenna for KTVL Channel 10 television, based in Medford, Oregon, approximately 15 miles (24 km) to the north.\n\nMount Ashland Ski Area has an oceanic subalpine climate (Köppen climate classification \"Dsc\"). The record high temperature at the Mount Ashland Ski Area is , while the record low is . Yearly rainfall averages over , while snowfall averages over . The high elevation results in heavy precipitation, despite being located at the end of the Rogue Valley, which is located in a rain shadow.\n\n"}

Their traditional historic lands were along the Platte River in what is now Nebraska.\n\nTwo important dialect divisions are evident in Pawnee: South Band and \"Skiri\". The distinction between the two dialects rests on differences in their respective phonetic inventory and lexicon.\n\nOnce the language of thousands of Pawnees, today Pawnee is spoken by a shrinking number of elderly speakers. As more young people learn English as their first language, the status of Pawnee declines towards extinction. However, as of 2007, the Pawnee Nation is developing teaching materials for the local high school and for adult language classes. Now, there are extensive documentary materials in the language archived at the American Indian Studies Research Institute. The Pawnee language can be heard spoken in the 2015 movie \"The Revenant\".\n\nThe following describes the South Band dialect.\n\nPawnee has eight consonant phonemes, and according to one analysis of medial- and final-position glottal stops, one may posit a ninth consonant phoneme.\n\n\nPawnee has four short vowel phonemes and four long counterparts (also phonemic).\n\nPawnee is an ergative-absolutive polysynthetic language.\n\nThe Pawnee alphabet has 9 consonants and 8 vowels.

The verse is based around a sample of \"He's the Greatest Dancer\" by Sister Sledge, and the chorus is sampled from \"Sang and Dance\" by the Bar-Kays. Released in January 1998, the song was Smith's second hit produced by Poke & Tone and L.E.S., who replaced his long-time partner Jazzy Jeff, though the record-scratching techniques of Jazzy Jeff can be heard in the song.\n\nThe song spent three weeks at the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart from March 14, 1998. It also won a Grammy Award in 1999 for the Best Rap Solo Performance. It was ranked the 68th greatest song of the 1990s by VH1. However, it was ranked at #19 on the list of AOL Radio's 100 Worst Songs Ever in 2010. The song was included in Pitchfork Media's 2010 list of \"the seven worst U.S. No. 1 singles of the 90s\".\n\nThe song samples the 1979 Sister Sledge song \"He's the Greatest Dancer\". The \"mama-uh, mama-uh, mama come closer\" line is a reference to the song \"Soul Makossa\" by Manu Dibango, specifically the version adapted by Michael Jackson in \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\"'s final bridge. The connotations associated with the expression getting jiggy were heavily influenced by this single. The term went from being used to acclaim one's fashion or style towards being synonymous with dancing, and eventually back to the original association with sexual connotations.\n\nSmith has attested in an interview that his inspiration to alter the meaning for the purpose of the song came from his association of the term \"jiggy\" with \"jigaboo\", a derogatory term for African-Americans, which made the literal meaning of the title \"getting African-American with it\" and which was meant to reference the popular folk-myth of an innate sense of rhythm in black folks. The co-opting of a once offensive word also was racially empowering.\n\nThe song was also sampled by a Russian pop group \"Hi-Fi\" in their 1999 song \"Pro Leto\" (translated as \"About Summer\").\n\nSince the song's release, many people have speculated if Nas helped compose it, as he also helped compose the songs \"Chasing Forever\", \"Yes Yes Y'all\" and \"Just Cruisin'\" for Smith. In April 2014 on the social networking site Reddit, Nas finally put the rumor to rest:\n\n\"Alright, let's clear this up once and for all. I hung out with Will in the studio. And watched him write it. It was a fun studio session, and I said a line or two or three to him. It wasn't that serious. Will Smith wrote that song. But seriously, I watched him have fun making that record on his own, and Will is a true MC.\"\n\n\"Music & Media\" wrote in their review of the song: \"Musician-cum-actor Smith seems to have an infallible knack for simply irresistible poppy R&B. This time around, Sister Sledge's much-loved 1979 disco smash 'He's The Greatest Dancer' serves as the foundation for his third surefire hit in a row (after 'Men In Black' and 'Just Cruisin).\"\n\nThe music video was directed by Hype Williams and was filmed at various hotels on the Las Vegas Strip, including the New York-New York Hotel and Casino, The Mirage, and the foyer of the Luxor Las Vegas.\n\nThe video features a series of tableaux including a Deee-Lite-inspired sequence, a glitzy Puffa jacket-style choreographed studio dance routine, a sequence set in Ancient Egypt and a volcano-backed Hawaiian/ Māori segment. Other music styles, including Bollywood, are referenced. The video closes with Smith dancing beneath the Statue of Liberty replica at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino.\n\n\"Gettin' Jiggy wit It\" won the 1998 MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video. The song was also nominated for four additional awards, including Best Choreography, Viewer's Choice, Best Dance Video, and Video of the Year, but these further nominations were lost to Madonna for her song \"Ray of Light\".\n\nIn the 1999 film \"Superstar\", lead character Mary Katherine Gallagher gets advice from Jesus Christ, played by Will Ferrell, telling her to \"Get jiggy wit it, Na na na na na na\". In the \"Seinfeld\" episode \"The Reverse Peephole\", Jerry is disappointed at not being selected as DJ for a house party, stating, in regards to his having previously DJ'ed, \"I got jiggy with it!\" The song is also featured in the video game \"Backyard Football '08\".\n\nThe song has also been spoofed and covered by various artists. DJ Screw created a chopped and screwed version of the song. Jam band Phish covered the song on their 1999 album \"Hampton Comes Alive\". The song was referenced in the King Crimson song \"The World's My Oyster Soup Kitchen Floor Wax Museum\" on \"The Construkction of Light\" album. Cassetteboy released a short spoof version of the song in the wake of the 2015 Piggate scandal (the allegation that the British Prime Minister David Cameron once placed \"a private part of his anatomy\" into the mouth of a dead pig's head) entitled \"Gettin Piggy With It\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2008994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008994", "title": "Inheritance Tax in the United Kingdom", "text": "Inheritance Tax in the United Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Inheritance Tax is a transfer tax. It was introduced with effect from 18 March 1986, replacing Capital Transfer Tax.\n\nPrior to the introduction of Estate Duty by the Finance Act 1894, there was a complex system of different taxes relating to the inheritance of property, that applied to either realty (land) or personalty (other personal property):\n\n\nIn 1894, estate duty replaced probate duty, account duty, certain additional succession duties, and temporary estate duty.\n\nLegacy duty and succession duty were later abolished by the Finance Act 1949, followed by the abolition of corporation duty by the Finance Act 1959. The three-year period for gifts made prior to death was extended to five years by the Finance Act 1946, and then to seven years by the Finance Act 1969.\n\nEstate duty became more progressive in scale, eventually peaking in 1969 with the highest marginal rate fixed at 85% of amounts in excess of £750,000, provided that total duty did not exceed 80% of the value of the total estate.\n\nEstate duty was abolished with the passage of the Finance Act 1975, which created the Capital Transfer Tax, with the following characteristics:\n\nCTT was reduced in scope during the Thatcher years, with most lifetime gifts removed by the Finance Act 1986. The tax was renamed as Inheritance Tax.\n\nFor IHT purposes, a person's estate includes:\n\n\nExcluded property comprises:\n\n\nRelief is also granted, where the value of the estate is reduced with respect to specified business property, agricultural property, woodlands, certain transfers made within three years of death made at a diminished value, and certain other cases.\n\nDeductions will be made from an estate's nil rate band with respect to transfers of value made in excess of specified limits, other than \"potentially exempt transfers\" made more than seven years before the transferor's death. Transfers of value made within specified limits are known as \"exempt transfers\".\n\nTransfers of value will also include gifts arising from the amount by which an asset is sold for less than it could have been sold on the open market, as for a sale from a parent to a child. Gifts can also arise where:\n\nWhere the value of such transfers exhausts the amount available to the nil rate band, IHT is assessed on the excess amount, to which the recipients of such transfers bear the liability to pay.\n\nFor deaths occurring on or after 1 September 2006, the following estates are effectively excepted from liability for IHT:\n\nTax is assessed at 40% of the net value of the estate, after application of the nil rate band. The applicable nil rate band will depend on the date of death: if the date falls at any time from 6 August to 5 April in a given tax year, the current year's band will apply; but, where the date is after 5 April but before 6 August, and application for a grant is filed before 6 August, the prior year's band will apply.\n\nFor deaths occurring after 5 April 2012, the tax is assessed at 36%, where at least 10% of a specified baseline amount of the estate has been bequeathed as charitable gifts. For purposes of calculation, the property of the estate is separated into three components, each of which is tested to see if the charitable gifts are sufficient to qualify for the lesser rate:\n\nIf applicable gifts meet the 10% threshold for a given component, in certain circumstances, upon election, the 36% rate applies to the whole estate. There are several options available for estates to be able to achieve that threshold, such as having the will specifying relevant gifts in terms of percentages of assets, or successors executing a deed of variation to attain the desired result.\n\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer's Autumn Statement on 9 October 2007 announced that with immediate effect inheritance tax allowances (often referred to as the nil-rate band) were to be transferable between married couples and between civil partners. Thus, for the 2007/8 tax year, a married couple will in effect have an allowance of £600,000 against inheritance tax, whilst a single person's allowance remains at £300,000. The mechanism for this enhanced allowance is that on the death of the second spouse to die, the nil rate band for the second spouse is increased by the percentage of the nil-rate band which was not used on the death of the first spouse to die.\n\nFor example, if in 2007/08 the first married spouse (or civil partner) to die were to leave £120,000 to their children and the rest of their estate to their spouse, there would be no inheritance tax due at that time and £180,000 or 60% of the nil-rate band would be unused. Later, upon the second death the nil-rate band would be 160% of the allowance for a single person, so that if the surviving spouse also died in 2007/08 the first £480,000 (160% of £300,000) of the surviving spouse's estate would be exempt from inheritance tax. If the surviving spouse died in a later year when the nil-rate band had reached £350,000, the first £560,000 (160% of £350,000) of the estate would be tax exempt.\n\nThis measure was also extended to existing widows, widowers and bereaved civil partners on 9 October 2007. If their late spouse or partner had not used all of their inheritance tax allowance at the time of the spouse's death, then the unused percentage of that allowance can now be added to the single person's allowance when the surviving spouse or partner dies. This applies irrespective of the date on which the first spouse died, but special rules apply if the surviving spouse remarries.\n\nIn a judgement following an unsuccessful appeal to a 2006 decision by the European Court of Human Rights, it was held that the above does not apply to siblings living together. The crucial factor in such cases was determined to be the existence of a public undertaking, carrying with it a body of rights and obligations of a contractual nature, rather than the length or supportive nature of the relationship.\n\nPrior to this legislative change, the most common means of ensuring that both nil-rate bands were used was called a nil band discretionary trust (now more properly known as NRB Relevant Property Trust*). This is an arrangement in both wills which says that whoever is the first to die leaves their nil band to a discretionary trust for the family, and not to the survivor. The survivor can still benefit from those assets if needed, but they are not part of that survivor's estate.\n\nIt is worth noting that as the Government seeks not to profit from the death of those who a) gave their lives in military service, or b) died from the results of a wound, injury, or disease associated with that military service, that the estates of such servicemen and women are exempt, totally, from any Inheritance Tax regardless of the value of the estate even if it amounts to millions of pounds as long as a) or b) apply...and that that exemption is then transferable to the serviceman's or servicewoman's widow or widower. That they do qualify as at a) or b) may be certified by application to the British MOD \"Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre\" (JCCC). The JCCC then inform the HMRC of that decision. The exemption does not apply to ex-servicemen or servicewomen who die from other causes unrelated to their military service.\n\nIn the summer budget of 2015 a new measure was outlined to reduce the burden of IHT for some estates by providing additional tax-free allowances in cases where the family home passed to direct descendants. This measure, called the Residence Nil-Rate Band (RNRB) came into effect upon the passage of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2015, and provided for the following scheduled amounts:\n\nThe Finance Act 2016 provided further relief in cases where all or part of the additional band could be lost, where a person had downsized to a less valuable residence or had ceased to own a residence after 8 July 2015 (and before the person has died). This is conditional upon the deceased having left that smaller residence, or assets of equivalent value, to direct descendants. These are defined as lineal descendants, spouses or civil partners of such lineal descendants, or former spouses or civil partners who have not become anyone else's spouse or civil partner.\n\nThe introduction of the RNRB means that a married couple leaving a residence to direct descendants can currently leave up to £900,000 tax-free between them (2018/19 tax year), with this tax-free amount rising to £1 million by April 2020. This tax-free allowance is diminished for estates worth more than £2 million.\n\nEffective with the 2005-06 tax year, the Finance Act 2004 introduced a retrospective income tax regime known as pre-owned asset tax (POAT) which covers transactions not made at arm's length, where a person either:\n\nand then subsequently benefits from its use.\n\nThe person liable for POAT may, while he is still alive, elect on a timely basis to have such transactions treated as gifts with reservations (thus subject to IHT) with respect to such transactions made in a given tax year.\n\nIn 2002, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother left her estate (estimated at £50 million) to her daughter Elizabeth II, including works of art, jewels, antiques and her thoroughbred racehorses. A deal made back in 1993 ensures that The Queen is spared inheritance tax of an estimated £20 million on her mother's estate.\n\nIn 2016 published letters and a prominent article in \"The Guardian\" by a leading accountant supported by Jeremy Corbyn criticised the tax-exempt arrangements of many largest landowners and the most capital-endowed. They advocated reform of tax on such wealth and for transparency of trusts, namely:\n\nThis critique followed the death of Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster, whose significant at-death loose \"interests\", the benefit of which his children by trustees' discretion perhaps receive demonstrate suspected tax savings. The unpublished size of the late Duke's death estate compares with the valuation of the family-related landholdings of £9,000,000,000. Critics claim inheritance tax impacts more on the living standards of the middle class and less on plutocrats and the super rich. If the family assets were taxed as if one taxable estate the taxation would equate to the inheritance taxes paid nationally for 2014-2015.\n\nSince c. 2006 tax of 20% must be paid on assets entering most UK non-death trusts combined with periodic charges of between 2% and 6% are due on the total value of the trust every 10 years. This is designed to replicate the 40 per cent death charge once a generation (assuming a normal life span to be around seven decades).\n\nGeorge Hodgson, interim chief executive of the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners, counter-argued for trusts to remain private on three grounds: many beneficiaries are children or vulnerable adults; the inheritance tax exemptions and counter-tax-planning structures help to protect jobs; \"An awful lot of trusts are used to hold family businesses\".\n\n\n\n"}

Located in front of Wat Suthat, it was formerly used in an old Brahmin ceremony, and is one of Bangkok's tourist attractions.\nThe Giant Swing was constructed in 1784 in front of the Devasathan shrine by King Rama I. During the reign of Rama II the swing ceremony was discontinued as the swing had become structurally damaged by lightning. In 1920 it was renovated and moved to its current location in order to make space for a gas plant. The ceremony was again performed until 1935, when it was discontinued after several fatal accidents.\n\nThe last renovations were done in 1959, and after 45 years of exposure to the elements the wooden pillars were showing signs of serious damage. A major reconstruction began in April 2005. Six teak tree trunks were used. The two used for the main structure of the swing are over 3.5 m in circumference and over 30m in height. The remaining four are used for support and are 2.30 m in circumference and 20 m in height. The swing was taken down in late October 2006 and the work finished in December of the same year. The rebuilt swing was dedicated in royal ceremonies presided over by King Bhumibol Adulyadej in September 2007. The timbers of the original swing are preserved in the Bangkok National Museum.\n\nIn 2005, the Giant Swing, together with Wat Suthat, was proposed as a future UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nWat Suthat Thep Wararam, commonly shortened to \"Wat Suthat\", is an important temple in Thailand. Inside the grand hall is a Phra Sri Sagaya Munee, its principal Buddha image which was acquired from Wat Mahathat in Sukhothai. Wat Suthat was built by King Rama I in the center of his capital, but it was completed in the reign of Rama III. Many people often make pilgrimages to worship the Buddha especially on holy days such as Visakha Bucha Day and Magha Bucha Day.\n\nIn the quarter there is also a well known and high regarded Chinese shrine, Sarn Choa Po Seu ('tiger shrine'). Originally it was a building on Bamrungmueng Road where the big Chinese communities were. Later, King Rama V expanded the road and had the shrine relocated to the current location on Ta Nao Road near WatMahanaparam. The site is a place of worship for Thai and Chinese people seeking success in career, money, love, and infant fertility.\n\nIt was built in King Rama III reign which is 1834 and now.. Tiger God Shrine is one of the most ancient and famous shrines in Thailand. Moreover, this shrine has beautiful interior design and has some antiquities. Most people come to pay respect to \"Tua Lao Aie\", a Chinese God to have good fortune, especially on Chinese New Year's Day.\n\nAt the heart of the quarter is LanKonMueng in front of city hall. Every morning and evening, this is the recreational area of the locals where they can exercise such as dance aerobics, jogging, stroll around, gather or just relax, bring children or pets out for a walk and enjoy the breeze.\n\nDevasathan Shrine is the most important religious and ancient place for Brahmin-Hindu in Thailand. It was built in 1784. which is in King Rama I's reign. According to ancient tradition, it was built for holding officiating religious ceremony in the past. Devasathan Shrine has three important sanctuaries which are Shiva sanctuary, Ganesha sanctuary, and Narayana sanctuary.\n\nThe small temple of Lord Vishnu on Unakan Road beside of Wat Suthat. This temple was built in 1982 on the 250th anniversary of Rattanakosin by the Association of Indian-Thai Chamber of Commerce as a sign of good relations between Thailand and India. The Vishnu idol was brought from India.\n\nAn annual swinging ceremony known as \"Triyampavai-Tripavai\" was held at Giant Swings of major cities until 1935, when it was abolished for safety reasons. The name of the ceremony was derived from the names of two Tamil language Hindu chants: \"Thiruvempavai\" (a Shaivite hymn by Manikkavacakar) and \"Thiruppavai\" (a Vaishnavite hymn by Andal). Among Thai people, the ceremony was popularly known as \"Lo Jin Ja\" or \"Lo-Chin-Cha\" (\"pulling the swing\"). It is known that Tamil verses from \"Thiruvempavai\" — \"poet pratu sivalai\" (\"opening the portals of Shiva's home\") — were recited at this ceremony, as well as the coronation ceremony of the Thai king. According to T.P. Meenakshisundaram, the name of the festival indicates that Thiruppavai might have been recited as well.\n\nAccording to an ancient Hindu epic, after Brahma created the world he sent Shiva to look after it. When Shiva descended to the earth, Naga serpents wrapped around the mountains in order to keep the earth in place. After Shiva found the earth solid, the Nagas moved to the seas in celebration. The Swing Ceremony was a re-enactment of this. The pillars of the Giant Swing represented the mountains, while the circular base of the swing represented the earth and the seas. In the ceremony Brahmins would swing, trying to grab a bag of coins placed on one of the pillars.\n\n\n"}

Playing at left end for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1954 to 1956, he was selected as a consensus first-team All-American in 1955 and a unanimous first-team All-American in 1956. His jersey (#87) was retired after Kramer's senior year, and he was inducted into both the College Football Hall of Fame and the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1978.\n\nKramer was selected by the Green Bay Packers as the fourth pick in the 1957 NFL Draft and played for the Packers for seven seasons (1957, 1959–1964). He was a key player on coach Vince Lombardi's first NFL championship teams in 1961 and 1962. Kramer was selected as a first-team All-NFL player in 1962 after catching 37 passes for 555 yards and seven touchdowns. He also played three seasons for the Detroit Lions from 1965 to 1967.\n\nBorn in Girard, Kansas, Kramer moved to East Detroit, Michigan (now Eastpointe) at age five. He attended East Detroit High School where he was an all-state player in football, basketball and track in high school. He competed in the shot put and long jump in track. In December 1952, Kramer was named as an end on the United Press All-Michigan football team.\n\nKramer enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1953. He was a three-sport athlete (football, basketball, and track) and led both the football and basketball teams in scoring for two years. Altogether, Kramer won a total of nine varsity letters in his three sports — the maximum number possible, as freshmen did not have athletic eligibility at the time.\n\nKramer played college football at the end position (both defensive and offensive) for the Michigan Woverines from 1954 through 1956. \n\nAs a 19-year-old sophomore, Kramer started all nine games at left end for the 1954 team that finished the season ranked #15 in the final AP Poll. He was the leading receiver for the Wolverines with 23 catches for 303 yards and two touchdowns. At the end of the 1954 season, he was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten player.\n\nAs a junior in 1955, Kramer started six games at left end and Michigan finished 12th in the final AP Poll. Kramer set a Michigan record with three touchdown passes in a game against Missouri in 1955. For the season as a whole, he caught 12 passes for 224 yards and four touchdowns, and he was selected as a consensus first-team end on the 1955 College Football All-America Team.\n\nKramer had his best collegiate season as a senior, starting all nine games in 1956 and the Wolverines ended at seventh in the final AP Poll. Kramer caught 18 passes for 353 yards and two touchdowns in 1956. At the end of the season, Kramer was an consensus first-team All-American.\n\nFollowing Kramer's senior year, Michigan retired his jersey number 87 -- one of only five numbers in school history to be retired. In three years at Michigan, Kramer caught 53 passes for 880 yards and eight touchdowns. He was also known as an outstanding tackler and blocker. Bennie Oosterbaan, Kramer's football coach at Michigan, described his blocking and tackling ability as his most valuable asset. Oosterbaan said this of his star player:\"To top off his marvelous physical gifts of size and speed and strength, plus an uncanny coordination, Kramer was one of the fiercest competitors I've ever seen. Nothing was impossible for him — the impossible was only a challenge.\" \n\nKramer also handled kicking and punting duties for Michigan. He handled 31 punts for a 40.6 yard average, kicked two field goals, and successfully converted 43 of 51 extra point attempts.\n\nKramer also excelled in basketball. He played at the center position and was selected as the basketball team's most valuable player as a junior. As basketball team captain, he was third-team All-Big Ten in 1957 after being second-team All-Big Ten in both 1955 and 1956. During his junior year, he averaged 20.4 points per game over a 22-game season and is a member of the career 1,000-point club. He held the Michigan career scoring record of 1,119 points from 1957 until it was broken by John Tidwell in 1961. He was a fifth round pick in the 1957 NBA draft (34th overall), selected by the Detroit Pistons.\n\nKramer was a two-sport professional athlete. He played in the Midwest Professional Basketball League for two seasons. Kramer played for the Battle Creek Warriors in 1961-1962, alongside former Michigan teammates M.C. Burton and John Tidwell. He and Burton then played for the Toledo Tartans in 1962-1963.\n\nKramer was the fourth overall selection in the 1957 NFL Draft, picked by the Green Bay Packers. Kramer also received an offer in February 1957 to play with the all-star basketball team that toured with the Harlem Globetrotters; he rejected the offer to play professional basketball. As a rookie for the Packers in 1957, Kramer appeared in 11 games and caught 28 passes for 337 yards. He missed the entire 1958 season due to service in the U.S. Air Force, and the Packers had the worst record in the league at 1–10–1.\n\nKramer returned to the Packers in 1959, but caught no passes that year and only four passes during the 1960 season. Teammate Paul Hornung later described Kramer's evolution after Vince Lombardi arrived in 1959:\"[O]ne real special case was Ron Kramer. He came to us, Ron did, with an I-don't-give-a-damn attitude. He had great ability and great confidence in it but he just didn't use it. For a long time, he wasn't able to do the job. Vince got on (him) something terrible. He never let up and then one day, after nearly two years of that I guess, things just went click, click, click and Ron Kramer became a magnificent football player.\"\n\nKramer reached his stride after moving to the tight end position during the 1961 season; that year, Kramer had 35 catches for 559 yards and four touchdowns. In 1962, Kramer caught 37 passes for 555 yards and seven touchdowns and was selected to play in the Pro Bowl and as a first-team All-Pro player. From 1961 to 1964, Kramer had at least 500 receiving yards every season, averaging 16 yards per reception. He became an integral part of Vince Lombardi's 1961 and 1962 teams that won the Packers' first NFL championships since 1944. In the 1961 NFL Championship Game, a 37-0 win for the Packer over the New York Giants, Kramer was the leading receiver, catching four passes for 80 yards and two touchdowns. In addition to his talent as a receiver, Kramer's talent as a blocker was an integral part of the famed \"Packers sweep.\"\n\nKramer played out his contract option with the Packers and, as a free agent, signed a one-year contract with the Detroit Lions in August 1965. The Lions were required to compensate the Packers with a first-round draft choice in 1966. Kramer had asked to be traded to the Lions so he could be closer to his wife and children. Teammate Jerry Kramer recalled, \"He asked Coach Lombardi to trade him because he was trying to save his marriage.\"\n\nKramer played three seasons for the Lions at the tight end position from 1965 to 1967. He appeared in 39 games for the Lions, 13 as a starter. In his first two seasons with the Lions, Kramer caught 55 passes for 638 yards and a touchdown. During the 1967 season, Kramer was slowed by injuries and caught only four passes for 40 yards in 11 games. \n\nIn July 1968, the Lions gave Kramer his unconditional release. Three weeks later, Kramer announced that, despite receiving offers to play for several other teams, he was resigning from football to assume a position as vice president of Paragon Steel Corp. in Detroit. Kramer later described his years with the Lions as \"awful\" and called head coach Harry Gilmer \"the dumbest guy I ever met.\"\n\nIn 10 NFL seasons, Kramer appeared in 128 games and totaled 229 receptions for 3,272 yards and 16 touchdowns. Out of his 16 career touchdown catches, 15 came in a three-year stretch from 1961 to 1963.\n\nAfter retiring as a football player, Kramer went into the steel business. In 1969, he was hired as a vice president of Paragon Steel Corp. of Detroit. He spent 22 years at Paragon before establishing Ron Kramer Industries in 1981, a company which is still in business today. He had two children, Kurtis Kramer and Cassandra Koehler.\n\nKramer received numerous honors and awards, including the following:\n\nKramer died in September 2010 at age 75.\n\nOn September 15, 2012, Kramer was recognized as a Michigan Football Legend and his jersey (#87) was unretired and given to Brandon Moore. Each player honored with the No. 87 jersey will wear a patch over the left upper chest honoring Kramer, and dress at a locker labeled with a plaque bearing his name and time of tenure at Michigan.\n\nIn 2019, despite not being in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he was chosen as a finalist for the NFL's 100th Anniversary Team.\n\n\n"}

Single context planning developed by the Museum of London has become the professional norm. The basic advantage of single context planning is context plans draw on \"transparent perma-trace paper\" can be overlaid for re-interpretation at a later date. \n\n\"Multi-context Plans\" as opposed to single context plans can be made of complete sites, trenches or individual features. In the United Kingdom, the scale of the plans is usually 1:20. They are linked to the site recording system by the inclusion of known grid points and height readings, taken with a dumpy level or a total station (see surveying). Excavation of a site by the removal of human made deposits in the reverse order they were created is the preferred method of excavation and is referred to as stratigraphic area excavation \"in plan\" as opposed to excavation \"in section\". Plan and section drawings have an interpretive function as well as being part of the recording system, because the draughts-person makes conscious decisions about what should be included or emphasised.\n\nIt is common and good practice on excavations to lay out a grid of 5m squares so as to facilitate planning. This grid is marked out on-site with grid pegs that form the baselines for tapes and other planning tools to aid the drawing of plans. It is also common practice that planning is done for each context on a separate piece of perma-trace that conforms to these 5m grid squares. This is part of the single context recording system \"(see Fig 1.)\" The site grid should be tied into a national geomatic database such as the Ordnance survey\n\nArchaeological planners use various symbols to denote characteristics of features and contexts and while conventions vary depending on practitioner, the following are representative:\n\nOn sites with little stratigraphic depth, a pre-excavation multi-context plan is sometimes made of all visible features before any excavation is carried out. This helps in planning strategy since problems of stratigraphy on rural sites are minimal as features often cut into the natural minimizing issues of inter-cutting features. Conversely, planning a multi-context urban site is difficult to achieve on a multi-context plan as the features and deposits when planned will obscure each other on the same planning sheet.\n\nPre-excavation plans have been critiqued as being of limited use on urban or deeply stratified sites and have also been attacked in professional archaeology where they have been described as a misused tool of the unscrupulous operators to give the impression the archaeological record for a given site has been dealt with adequately.\n\nThis critical point of view contends, that comparisons between pre and post-excavation plans can demonstrate that a site has not been comprehensively excavated on the basis of a pre-ex plan alone. In many cases there is a pronounced difference between the two phases of planning. Although many features may be visible at ground level following machining, it is often the case that the true limits of features are not so initially discernible until the area of the feature is fully cleaned and subsequently excavated revealing further features and relationships lower in the sequence.\n\n"}

It is the capital of the Western Highlands Province and is located in the large fertile Wahgi Valley in central mainland Papua New Guinea, at an elevation of .\n\nThe Highlands Highway is the main arterial route to connect Mount Hagen with the coastal cities of Lae and Madang.\n\nThe city is named after the old eroded volcano Mount Hagen, located about to the north-west. The volcano was named after the German colonial officer (1859-1897).\n\nIn 1933 Mick Leahy, brother Dan Leahy, and government officer Jim Taylor conducted an aerial reconnaissance of the highlands and discovered the huge and heavily populated Wahgi Valley. A short time later they walked in with a well supplied patrol and became the first westerners to come into contact with the tribes that are now in the location of Mount Hagen. The first patrol built an airstrip at Kelua, a short distance from modern Mount Hagen. From 1934, a new airstrip, the 'Mogei drome' or 'Mogai Aerodrome', was located on a site where the future town was formed. The first flight arrived here on 1 April 1934, piloted by Bob Gurney, with the first airmail leaving the next day. Later, this airstrip was to become the main street passing by China town and the airstrip (current) was moved 15 minutes out of town.\n\nEach year, Mount Hagen hosts the Mount Hagen Cultural Show, one of the largest cultural events in Papua New Guinea. Various regional, provincial, even national tribal dance groups gather to celebrate their cultural heritage in the form of sing-sing. It is also one of the biggest tourist attractions of the country. Its near the Baiyer District which hosts the biggest collection of birds and wildlife in Papua New Guinea, the Baiyer River Sanctuary. Although locals do not recommend visiting the sanctuary as the road through the Baiyer District is prone to many highway robberies.\n\nTraditional culture and beliefs remain strong in Mount Hagen and its surrounds. In 2009, and again 2013, local women were reportedly burned alive after being accused of sorcery. Recent thinking links the upsurge in such accusations with poor development outcomes in Papua New Guinea and the erosion of social capital through fear and mistrust.\n\nMount Hagen Airport is located at Kagamuga, a satellite town 15 minutes drive from the centre of Mount Hagen. It is an international airport although flights into and out of it are not always available to the public. The airport altitude is above sea level. Currently, Hevilift operates a charter service using ATR-42 and Twin Otter aircraft from Cairns, Queensland, for mine workers at the Porgera Gold Mine in Enga Province. Asia Pacific Airlines also fly Dash 8s regularly to Tabubil, their hub, to service the Ok Tedi Mine. Air Niugini also service Mount Hagen, with regular Fokker 100 and Dash 8 services to destinations such as Port Moresby, Moro and Cairns. PNG Air also operate regular services to and from Mt Hagen to Port Moresby, Tabubil , Kiunga and Wewak. Near the airport is Airport Hotel.\n\nFrom time to time, the combination of altitude, midday temperatures and runway length restrict takeoff weights for domestic flights out of Mount Hagen.\n\nMount Hagen is connected via the Highlands Highway to the city of Lae and other provincial capitals such as Madang, Goroka, Wabag, Mendi and Kundiawa. The road between Mount Hagen and all these centers is theoretically sealed, although frequent landslides and general deterioration can lead to parts of the road becoming unsealed or rough.\n\nYou can travel from Mt Hagen along the Highlands Highway by using the popular PMV buses which operate as taxis or hire a car from the numerous hire car companies within Mt Hagen.

{"id": "2009032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009032", "title": "Cherrapunji", "text": "Cherrapunji\n\nCherrapunji () or Sohra is a subdivisional town in the East Khasi Hills district in the Indian state of Meghalaya. It is the traditional capital of ka \"hima\" Nongkhlaw (Khasi tribal kingdom)\n\nCherrapunji has often been credited as being the wettest place on Earth, but for now nearby Mawsynram currently holds that distinction. It still holds the all-time record for the most rainfall in a calendar month and in a year, however: it received in July 1861 and between 1 August 1860 and 31 July 1861.\n\nThe history of the Khasi people – native inhabitants of Cherrapunji – may be traced from the early part of the 16th century. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, these people were ruled by their tribal 'Syiems (rajas or chiefs) of Khyriem' in the Khasi Hills. The Khasi hills came under British authority in 1883 with the submission of the last of the important Syiem, Tirot Sing Syiem.\n\nThe main pivot on which the entire superstructure of Khasi society rests is the matrilineal system.\n\nThe original name for this town was Sohra (soh-ra), which was pronounced \"Cherra\" by the British. This name eventually evolved into a temporary name, Cherrapunji, meaning 'land of oranges', which was first used by tourists from other parts of India. It has again been renamed to its original form, Sohra.\n\nDespite abundant rainfall, Cherrapunji faces an acute water shortage and the inhabitants often have to trek very long distances to obtain potable water. Irrigation is hampered due to excessive rain washing away the topsoil as a result of human encroachment into the forests. Recent developments of rain-water harvesting techniques in the area have greatly helped the town and its neighbouring villages.\n\nThere is a monument to David Scott (British Administrator in NE India, 1802–31) in the town's cemetery.\n\nIt has an average elevation of and sits on a plateau in the southern part of the Khasi Hills, facing the plains of Bangladesh. The plateau rises 660 meters above the surrounding valleys.\n\nSoils on the plateau are poor owing to deforestation and washout caused by heavy rainfall. Owing to winter droughts, the vegetation in this location is even xerophytic in spite of the town's fame as an extremely wet place. Additional pressure on local ecosystems is created by the rapid increase of the population — from a Sohra-area population of 7,000 in 1960, it grew to over 10,000 by 2000.\n\nThe valleys around Cherrapunji, however, are covered with lush and very diverse vegetation, containing numerous endemic species of plants, including Meghalaya subtropical forests.\n\nThere are some interesting living root bridges in villages near Cherrapunji like the Umshiang root bridge, Mawsaw root bridge, Ritymmen root bridge and the Double Decker woot bridge at Nongriat village. \n\nThe Shillong Plateau is an uplifted horst-like feature, bounded by the E-W Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) to the North, the N-S Jamuna fault in the west, and the NW-SE kopilli fracture zone in the east.\n\nCherrapunji has a mild subtropical highland climate (Köppen \"Cwb\"), with monsoonal influences typical of India. The city's annual rainfall average stands at . This figure places it behind only nearby Mawsynram, Meghalaya, whose average is . Cherrapunji receives both the southwest and northeast monsoonal winds, giving it a single monsoon season. It lies on the windward side of the Khasi Hills, so the resulting orographic lift enhances precipitation. In the winter months it receives the northeast monsoon showers that travel down the Brahmaputra valley. The driest months are November, December, January and February. \n\nTemperatures average in January and in August, and the annual mean is \n\nCherrapunji holds two Guinness world records for receiving the maximum amount of rainfall in a single year: of rainfall between August 1860 and July 1861 and for receiving the maximum amount of rainfall in a single month: in July 1861.\n\nCherrapunji receives rains from the Bay of Bengal arm of the Indian summer monsoon. The monsoon clouds fly unhindered over the plains of Bangladesh for about 400 km. Thereafter, they hit the Khasi Hills which rise abruptly from the plains to a height of about 1,370 m above mean sea level within 2 to 5 km. The geography of the hills with many deep valley channels encompassing the low-flying (150–300 m) moisture-laden clouds from a wide area converges over Cherrapunji. The winds push the rain clouds through these gorges and up the steep slopes. The rapid ascent of the clouds into the upper atmosphere hastens the cooling and helps vapours to condense. Most of the rain is the result of air being lifted as a large body of water vapour. The extreme amount of rainfall is perhaps the best-known feature of orographic rain in northeastern India.\n\nOccasionally, cloudbursts can occur in one part of Cherrapunji while other areas may be totally or relatively dry, reflecting the high spatial variability of the rainfall. Atmospheric humidity is extremely high during the peak monsoon period.\n\nThe major part of the rainfall at Cherrapunji can be attributed to the orographic features. When the clouds are blown over the hills from the south, they are funneled through the valley. The clouds strike Cherrapunji perpendicularly and the low flying clouds are pushed up the steep slopes. It is not surprising to find that the heaviest rainfalls occur when the winds blow directly on the Khasi Hills.\n\nA notable feature of monsoon rain at Cherrapunji is that most of it falls in the morning. This could be partly due to two air masses coming together. During the monsoon months, the prevailing winds along the Brahmaputra valley generally blow from the east or the northeast, but the winds over Meghalaya are from the south. These two winds systems usually come together in the vicinity of the Khasi Hills. Apparently, the winds that are trapped in the valley at night begin their upward ascent only after they are warmed during the day. This partially explains the frequency of morning rainfall. Apart from orographic features, atmospheric convection plays an important role during the monsoon and the period just preceding it.\n\n India census, Cherrapunji had a population of 10,086, with males 48.75% of the total population and females 51.25%. It has an average literacy rate of 74%, higher than the national average of 59.5%, with a male literacy rate of 72.4% and a female one of 73.9%.\n\nThe locals living in and around Cherrapunji are known as Khasis. It is a matrilineal culture. After the wedding, the husband of the youngest daughter goes to live with his wife's family, who own the property of the family, while others live on their own getting a bit of the share. The children take on the surname of the mother.\n\nCherrapunji is also famous for its living bridges. Over hundreds of years the people have developed techniques for growing roots of trees into large bridges. The process takes 10 to 15 years and the bridges typically last hundreds of years, the oldest ones in use being over 500 years old.\n\nSohra Government College is the only general degree college in the town. Most students move to the state capital for college degrees. Schools, like the Ramkrishna Mission which are independent and government-run schools like the Thomas Jones School have been set up in and around the town. \nCherrapunji has an All India Radio relay station known as Akashvani Cherrapunji. It broadcasts on FM frequencies.\n\n\n"}

Concrete notions of complexity used include restrictions for smoothness and bounds on the vector space norm.\n\nA theoretical justification for regularization is that it attempts to impose Occam's razor on the solution (as depicted in the figure above, where the green function, the simpler one, may be preferred). From a Bayesian point of view, many regularization techniques correspond to imposing certain prior distributions on model parameters.\n\nRegularization can serve multiple purposes, including learning simpler models, inducing models to be sparse and introducing group structure into the learning problem.\n\nThe same idea arose in many fields of science. A simple form of regularization applied to integral equations, generally termed Tikhonov regularization after Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov, is essentially a trade-off between fitting the data and reducing a norm of the solution. More recently, non-linear regularization methods, including total variation regularization, have become popular.\n\nRegularization can be motivated as a technique to improve the generalizability of a learned model.\n\nThe goal of this learning problem is to find a function that fits or predicts the outcome (label) that minimizes the expected error over all possible inputs and labels. The expected error of a function formula_11 is:\n\nwhere formula_13 and formula_14 are the domains of input data formula_1 and their labels formula_7 respectively. \n\nTypically in learning problems, only a subset of input data and labels are available, measured with some noise. Therefore, the expected error is unmeasurable, and the best surrogate available is the empirical error over the formula_17 available samples:\n\nWithout bounds on the complexity of the function space (formally, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space) available, a model will be learned that incurs zero loss on the surrogate empirical error. If measurements (e.g. of formula_19) were made with noise, this model may suffer from overfitting and display poor expected error. Regularization introduces a penalty for exploring certain regions of the function space used to build the model, which can improve generalization.\n\nWhen learning a linear function formula_10, characterized by an unknown vector formula_21 such that formula_22, one can add the formula_23-norm of the vector formula_21 to the loss expression in order to prefer solutions with smaller norms. This is called Tikhonov regularization, one of the most common forms of regularization. It is also known as ridge regression. It is expressed as:\n\nIn the case of a general function, we take the norm of the function in its reproducing kernel Hilbert space:\n\nAs the formula_23 norm is differentiable, learning problems using Tikhonov regularization can be solved by gradient descent.\n\nThe learning problem with the least squares loss function and Tikhonov regularization can be solved analytically. Written in matrix form, the optimal formula_21 will be the one for which the gradient of the loss function with respect to formula_21 is 0.\n\nBy construction of the optimization problem, other values of formula_21 would give larger values for the loss function. This could be verified by examining the second derivative formula_36.\n\nDuring training, this algorithm takes formula_37 time. The terms correspond to the matrix inversion and calculating formula_38, respectively. Testing takes formula_39 time.\n\nEarly stopping can be viewed as regularization in time. Intuitively, a training procedure like gradient descent will tend to learn more and more complex functions as the number of iterations increases. By regularizing on time, the complexity of the model can be controlled, improving generalization.\n\nIn practice, early stopping is implemented by training on a training set and measuring accuracy on a statistically independent validation set. The model is trained until performance on the validation set no longer improves. The model is then tested on a testing set.\n\nConsider the finite approximation of Neumann series for an invertible matrix where formula_40:\n\nThis can be used to approximate the analytical solution of unregularized least squares, if is introduced to ensure the norm is less than one.\n\nThe exact solution to the unregularized least squares learning problem will minimize the empirical error, but may fail to generalize and minimize the expected error. By limiting , the only free parameter in the algorithm above, the problem is regularized on time which may improve its generalization.\n\nThe algorithm above is equivalent to restricting the number of gradient descent iterations for the empirical risk\n\nwith the gradient descent update:\n\nThe base case is trivial. The inductive case is proved as follows:\n\nAssume that a dictionary formula_46 with dimension formula_47 is given such that a function in the function space can be expressed as:\n\nEnforcing a sparsity constraint on formula_21 can lead to simpler and more interpretable models. This is useful in many real-life applications such as computational biology. An example is developing a simple predictive test for a disease in order to minimize the cost of performing medical tests while maximizing predictive power.\n\nA sensible sparsity constraint is the formula_50 norm formula_51, defined as the number of non-zero elements in formula_21. Solving a formula_50 regularized learning problem, however, has been demonstrated to be NP-hard.\n\nThe formula_54 norm (see also Norms) can be used to approximate the optimal formula_50 norm via convex relaxation. It can be shown that the formula_54 norm induces sparsity. In the case of least squares, this problem is known as LASSO in statistics and basis pursuit in signal processing.\n\nformula_54 regularization can occasionally produce non-unique solutions. A simple example is provided in the figure when the space of possible solutions lies on a 45 degree line. This can be problematic for certain applications, and is overcome by combining formula_54 with formula_23 regularization in elastic net regularization, which takes the following form:\n\nElastic net regularization tends to have a grouping effect, where correlated input features are assigned equal weights.\n\nElastic net regularization is commonly used in practice and is implemented in many machine learning libraries.\n\nWhile the formula_54 norm does not result in an NP-hard problem, the formula_54 norm is convex but is not strictly diffentiable due to the kink at x = 0. Subgradient methods which rely on the subderivative can be used to solve formula_54 regularized learning problems. However, faster convergence can be achieved through proximal methods.\n\nFor a problem formula_65 such that formula_66 is convex, continuous, differentiable, with Lipschitz continuous gradient (such as the least squares loss function), and formula_67 is convex, continuous, and proper, then the proximal method to solve the problem is as follows. First define the proximal operator\n\nand then iterate\n\nThe proximal method iteratively performs gradient descent and then projects the result back into the space permitted by formula_67.\n\nWhen formula_67 is the formula_54 regularizer, the proximal operator is equivalent to the soft-thresholding operator,\n\nThis allows for efficient computation.\n\nGroups of features can be regularized by a sparsity constraint, which can be useful for expressing certain prior knowledge into an optimization problem.\n\nIn the case of a linear model with non-overlapping known groups, a regularizer can be defined:\n\nThis can be viewed as inducing a regularizer over the formula_23 norm over members of each group followed by an formula_54 norm over groups.\n\nThis can be solved by the proximal method, where the proximal operator is a block-wise soft-thresholding function:\n\nThe algorithm described for group sparsity without overlaps can be applied to the case where groups do overlap, in certain situations. This will likely result in some groups with all zero elements, and other groups with some non-zero and some zero elements.\n\nIf it is desired to preserve the group structure, a new regularizer can be defined:\n\nFor each formula_80, formula_81 is defined as the vector such that the restriction of formula_81 to the group formula_83 equals formula_80 and all other entries of formula_81 are zero. The regularizer finds the optimal disintegration of formula_21 into parts. It can be viewed as duplicating all elements that exist in multiple groups. Learning problems with this regularizer can also be solved with the proximal method with a complication. The proximal operator cannot be computed in closed form, but can be effectively solved iteratively, inducing an inner iteration within the proximal method iteration.\n\nWhen labels are more expensive to gather than input examples, semi-supervised learning can be useful. Regularizers have been designed to guide learning algorithms to learn models that respect the structure of unsupervised training samples. If a symmetric weight matrix formula_87 is given, a regularizer can be defined:\n\nIf formula_89 encodes the result of some distance metric for points formula_19 and formula_91, it is desirable that formula_92. This regularizer captures this intuition, and is equivalent to:\n\nThe optimization problem formula_96 can be solved analytically if the constraint formula_97 is applied for all supervised samples. The labeled part of the vector formula_10 is therefore obvious. The unlabeled part of formula_10 is solved for by:\n\nNote that the pseudo-inverse can be taken because formula_103 has the same range as formula_104.\n\nIn the case of multitask learning, formula_105 problems are considered simultaneously, each related in some way. The goal is to learn formula_105 functions, ideally borrowing strength from the relatedness of tasks, that have predictive power. This is equivalent to learning the matrix formula_107 .\n\nThis regularizer defines an L2 norm on each column and an L1 norm over all columns. It can be solved by proximal methods.\n\nThis regularizer constrains the functions learned for each task to be similar to the overall average of the functions across all tasks. This is useful for expressing prior information that each task is expected to share similarities with each other task. An example is predicting blood iron levels measured at different times of the day, where each task represents a different person.\n\nThis regularizer is similar to the mean-constrained regularizer, but instead enforces similarity between tasks within the same cluster. This can capture more complex prior information. This technique has been used to predict Netflix recommendations. A cluster would correspond to a group of people who share similar preferences in movies.\n\nMore general than above, similarity between tasks can be defined by a function. The regularizer encourages the model to learn similar functions for similar tasks.\n\nBayesian learning methods make use of a prior probability that (usually) gives lower probability to more complex models. Well-known model selection techniques include the Akaike information criterion (AIC), minimum description length (MDL), and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Alternative methods of controlling overfitting not involving regularization include cross-validation.\n\nExamples of applications of different methods of regularization to the linear model are:\n\n"}

The regulator, also known as a \"cutoff\", models our lack of knowledge about physics at unobserved scales (e.g. scales of small size or large energy levels). It compensates for (and requires) the possibility that \"new physics\" may be discovered at those scales which the present theory is unable to model, while enabling the current theory to give accurate predictions as an \"effective theory\" within its intended scale of use.\n\nIt is distinct from renormalization, another technique to control infinities without assuming new physics, by adjusting for self-interaction feedback.\n\nRegularization was for many decades controversial even amongst its inventors, as it combines physical and epistemological claims into the same equations. However, it is now well understood and has proven to yield useful, accurate predictions.\n\nRegularization procedures deal with infinite, divergent, and nonsensical expressions by introducing an auxiliary concept of a regulator (for example, the minimal distance formula_1 in space which is useful, in case the divergences arise from short-distance physical effects). The correct physical result is obtained in the limit in which the regulator goes away (in our example, formula_2), but the virtue of the regulator is that for its finite value, the result is finite.\n\nHowever, the result usually includes terms proportional to expressions like formula_3 which are not well-defined in the limit formula_2. Regularization is the first step towards obtaining a completely finite and meaningful result; in quantum field theory it must be usually followed by a related, but independent technique called renormalization. Renormalization is based on the requirement that some physical quantities — expressed by seemingly divergent expressions such as formula_3 — are equal to the observed values. Such a constraint allows one to calculate a finite value for many other quantities that looked divergent.\n\nThe existence of a limit as ε goes to zero and the independence of the final result from the regulator are nontrivial facts. The underlying reason for them lies in universality as shown by Kenneth Wilson and Leo Kadanoff and the existence of a second order phase transition. Sometimes, taking the limit as ε goes to zero is not possible. This is the case when we have a Landau pole and for nonrenormalizable couplings like the Fermi interaction. However, even for these two examples, if the regulator only gives reasonable results for formula_6 and we are working with scales of the order of formula_7, regulators with formula_8 still give pretty accurate approximations. The physical reason why we can't take the limit of ε going to zero is the existence of new physics below Λ.\n\nIt is not always possible to define a regularization such that the limit of ε going to zero is independent of the regularization. In this case, one says that the theory contains an anomaly. Anomalous theories have been studied in great detail and are often founded on the celebrated Atiyah–Singer index theorem or variations thereof (see, for example, the chiral anomaly).\n\nThe problem of infinities first arose in the classical electrodynamics of point particles in the 19th and early 20th century.\n\nThe mass of a charged particle should include the mass–energy in its electrostatic field (electromagnetic mass). Assume that the particle is a charged spherical shell of radius . The mass–energy in the field is\n\nwhich becomes infinite as . This implies that the point particle would have infinite inertia, making it unable to be accelerated. Incidentally, the value of that makes formula_10 equal to the electron mass is called the classical electron radius, which (setting formula_11 and restoring factors of and formula_12) turns out to be\n\nwhere formula_14 is the fine structure constant, and formula_15 is the Compton wavelength of the electron.\n\nRegularization: This process shows that the physical theory originally used breaks down at small scales. It shows that the electron cannot in fact be a point particle, and that some kind of additional new physics (in this case, a finite radius) is needed to explain systems below a certain scale. This same argument will appear in other renormalization problems: a theory holds in some domain but can be seen to break down and require new physics at other scales in order to avoid infinities. (Another way to avoid the infinity but while retaining the point nature of the particle would be to postulate a small additional dimension over which the particle could 'spread out' rather than over 3D space; this is a motivation for string theory.)\n\nSpecific types of regularization procedures include\n\nPerturbative predictions by quantum field theory about quantum scattering of elementary particles, implied by a corresponding Lagrangian density, are computed using the Feynman rules, a regularization method to circumvent ultraviolet divergences so as to obtain finite results for Feynman diagrams containing loops, and a renormalization scheme. Regularization method results in regularized n-point Green's functions (propagators), and a suitable limiting procedure (a renormalization scheme) then leads to perturbative S-matrix elements. These are independent of the particular regularization method used, and enable one to model perturbatively the measurable physical processes (cross sections, probability amplitudes, decay widths and lifetimes of excited states). However, so far no known regularized n-point Green's functions can be regarded as being based on a physically realistic theory of quantum-scattering since the derivation of each disregards some of the basic tenets of conventional physics (e.g., by not being Lorentz-invariant, by introducing either unphysical particles with a negative metric or wrong statistics, or discrete space-time, or lowering the dimensionality of space-time, or some combination thereof). So the available regularization methods are understood as formalistic technical devices, devoid of any direct physical meaning. In addition, there are qualms about renormalization. For a history and comments on this more than half-a-century old open conceptual problem, see e.g.\n\nAs it seems that the vertices of non-regularized Feynman series adequately describe interactions in quantum scattering, it is taken that their ultraviolet divergences are due to the asymptotic, high-energy behavior of the Feynman propagators. So it is a prudent, conservative approach to retain the vertices in Feynman series, and modify only the Feynman propagators to create a regularized Feynman series. This is the reasoning behind the formal Pauli–Villars covariant regularization by modification of Feynman propagators through auxiliary unphysical particles, cf. and representation of physical reality by Feynman diagrams.\n\nIn 1949 Pauli conjectured there is a realistic regularization, which is implied by a theory that respects all the established principles of contemporary physics. So its propagators (i) do not need to be regularized, and (ii) can be regarded as such a regularization of the propagators used in quantum field theories that might reflect the underlying physics. The additional parameters of such a theory do not need to be removed (i.e. the theory needs no renormalization) and may provide some new information about the physics of quantum scattering, though they may turn out experimentally to be negligible. By contrast, any present regularization method introduces formal coefficients that must eventually be disposed of by renormalization.\n\nPaul Dirac was persistently, extremely critical about procedures of renormalization. In 1963, he wrote, \"… in the renormalization theory we have a theory that has defied all the attempts of the mathematician to make it sound. I am inclined to suspect that the renormalization theory is something that will not survive in the future,…\" He further observed that \"One can distinguish between two main procedures for a theoretical physicist. One of them is to work from the experimental basis ... The other procedure is to work from the mathematical basis. One examines and criticizes the existing theory. One tries to pin-point the faults in it and then tries to remove them. The difficulty here is to remove the faults without destroying the very great successes of the existing theory.\"\n\nAbdus Salam remarked in 1972, \"Field-theoretic infinities first encountered in Lorentz's computation of electron have persisted in classical electrodynamics for seventy and in quantum electrodynamics for some thirty-five years. These long years of frustration have left in the subject a curious affection for the infinities and a passionate belief that they are an inevitable part of nature; so much so that even the suggestion of a hope that they may after all be circumvented - and finite values for the renormalization constants computed - is considered irrational.\"\n\nHowever, in Gerard ’t Hooft’s opinion, \"History tells us that if we hit upon some obstacle, even if it looks like a pure formality or just a technical complication, it should be carefully scrutinized. Nature might be telling us something, and we should find out what it is.\"\n\nThe difficulty with a realistic regularization is that so far there is none, although nothing could be destroyed by its bottom-up approach; and there is no experimental basis for it.\n\nConsidering distinct theoretical problems, Dirac in 1963 suggested: \"I believe separate ideas will be needed to solve these distinct problems and that they will be solved one at a time through successive stages in the future evolution of physics. At this point I find myself in disagreement with most physicists. They are inclined to think one master idea will be discovered that will solve all these problems together. I think it is asking too much to hope that anyone will be able to solve all these problems together. One should separate them one from another as much as possible and try to tackle them separately. And I believe the future development of physics will consist of solving them one at a time, and that after any one of them has been solved there will still be a great mystery about how to attack further ones.\"\n\nAccording to Dirac, \"Quantum electrodynamics is the domain of physics that we know most about, and presumably it will have to be put in order before we can hope to make any fundamental progress with other field theories, although these will continue to develop on the experimental basis.\"\n\nDirac’s two preceding remarks suggest that we should start searching for a realistic regularization in the case of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, starting with the original QED Lagrangian density.\n\nThe path-integral formulation provides the most direct way from the Lagrangian density to the corresponding Feynman series in its Lorentz-invariant form. The free-field part of the Lagrangian density determines the Feynman propagators, whereas the rest determines the vertices. As the QED vertices are considered to adequately describe interactions in QED scattering, it makes sense to modify only the free-field part of the Lagrangian density so as to obtain such regularized Feynman series that the Lehmann–Symanzik–Zimmermann reduction formula provides a perturbative S-matrix that: (i) is Lorentz-invariant and unitary; (ii) involves only the QED particles; (iii) depends solely on QED parameters and those introduced by the modification of the Feynman propagators—for particular values of these parameters it is equal to the QED perturbative S-matrix; and (iv) exhibits the same symmetries as the QED perturbative S-matrix. Let us refer to such a regularization as \"the minimal realistic regularization\", and start searching for the corresponding, modified free-field parts of the QED Lagrangian density.\n\nAccording to Bjorken and Drell, it would make physical sense to sidestep ultraviolet divergences by using more detailed description than can be provided by differential field equations. And Feynman noted about the use of differential equations: \"... for neutron diffusion it is only an approximation that is good when the distance over which we are looking is large compared with the mean free path. If we looked more closely, we would see individual neutrons running around.\" And then he wondered, \"Could it be that the real world consists of little X-ons which can be seen only at very tiny distances? And that in our measurements we are always observing on such a large scale that we can’t see these little X-ons, and that is why we get the differential equations? ... Are they [therefore] also correct only as a smoothed-out imitation of a really much more complicated microscopic world?\"\n\nAlready in 1938, Heisenberg proposed that a quantum field theory can provide only an idealized, large-scale description of quantum dynamics, valid for distances larger than some \"fundamental length\", expected also by Bjorken and Drell in 1965. Feynman's preceding remark provides a possible physical reason for its existence; either that or it is just another way of saying the same thing (there is a fundamental unit of distance) but having no new information.\n\nThe need for regularization terms in any quantum field theory of quantum gravity is a major motivation for physics beyond the standard model. Infinities of the non-gravitational forces in QFT can be controlled via renormalization only but additional regularization - and hence new physics—is required uniquely for gravity. The regularizers model, and work around, the break down of QFT at small scales and thus show clearly the need for some other theory to come into play beyond QFT at these scales. A. Zee (Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell, 2003) considers this to be a benefit of the regularization framework—theories can work well in their intended domains but also contain information about their own limitations and point clearly to where new physics is needed.\n"}

Included among the papers were all Party membership cards with identification photos, documents relating to the Party, SA courts, and SA administration.\"\n\nSix to seven million of these cards were moved to the Army's Munich headquarters, located in the \"Reichfinanzhof\" building (Reich Finance Court). Browne's report included a photo of these files. \nBrowne came upon the remaining files at the paper mill in September 1945. He alerted General Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), which immediately ordered a major task force to organize and catalog the files. Browne's discovery received worldwide press coverage.\nThe files subsequently became the heart of the collections of the Berlin Document Center (BDC), and were instrumental in the Allied Denazification of Germany, and in the Nuremberg War Crimes trials.\n\nIn 2000, \"Test of Courage\" a biography of former CIC Agent Michel Thomas gave an account of his rescue of the files in May 1945.

This states that the first U.S. soldier to see the files in May 1945 was Counter Intelligence Corps Agent Francesco Quaranta. However, when the investigator interviewed Quaranta's widow, she said he did not speak or read German and would not have understood what was on the cards, nor did he ever mention any role in the discovery of the files.\n\nAs of 2002, only one other Agent survived from Thomas's unit, Mr. Walter Wimer.

Reid was included in the year-end world top 10 rankings for 12 consecutive years (1968–1979). She won at least one tournament annually from 1966 through 1979, except for 1975. Her career-high ranking was World No. 5 in 1971, behind Margaret Court, Billie Jean King, Evonne Goolagong, and Rosie Casals.\n\nReid began her Grand Slam tennis career in 1963 when she reached the third round of the Australian Championships. In 1966, she reached the semifinals of both the Australian and US Championships, defeating Billie Jean King in the second round of the latter tournament. In 1967, Reid again reached the semifinals of the Australian Championships and reached the semifinals of the French Championships for the first and only time.\n\nReid was the women's singles runner-up at the 1970 Australian Open, losing to Margaret Court in the final in straight sets. Reid also was the women's singles runner-up at the US Open in 1972, losing to King after defeating Chris Evert in one semifinal 6–4, 6–2.\n\nIn 1972, Reid reached the final of the inaugural WTA Tour Championships, where she lost to Evert 7–5, 6–4.\n\nIn January 1977, Reid won her only Grand Slam singles title when she defeated fellow Australian Dianne Fromholtz 7–5, 6–2 in the final of the Australian Open. Reid and Fromholtz were the only top 10 players who played the tournament. The previous week, Reid also defeated Fromholtz in the final of the New South Wales Open, where Reid and Fromholtz again were the only top 10 players who entered. On both the Virginia Slims and the Colgate Grand Prix tours in 1977, Reid qualified for the season-ending tournaments (each limited to the top eight players on the respective tour). In World Team Tennis, Reid was undefeated in singles against both Martina Navratilova and Virginia Wade, defeating each three times.\n\nReid capped her last year on the professional tour in 1979 by beating Navratilova for the first time in tournament play. Reid defeated Navratilova in a Family Circle Cup semifinal 6–3, 7–6, then lost to Tracy Austin in the final 7–6, 7–6. Reid also competed in the year-ending WTA Tour Championships (limited to the year's top 8 players).\n\nReid won the Australian Open women's doubles title twice, outright in 1968 and shared in December 1977. With Wendy Turnbull in 1978, Reid won the women's doubles title at Wimbledon, was the doubles runner-up at the US Open, and won the doubles titles at the Virginia Slims of Seattle, the Virginia Slims of Philadelphia, the US Women's Indoor Championships, and the New South Wales Open.\n\nReid was a member of the Australian team that won the Federation Cup in 1968.

The band consists of Jack White (vocals, guitar), Brendan Benson (vocals, guitar), Jack Lawrence (bass guitar), and Patrick Keeler (drums). Lawrence and Keeler were originally members of the Greenhornes, while White and Lawrence went on to become members of the Dead Weather.\n\nThe band is based in Nashville, Tennessee. According to the band's official website, \"The seed was sown in an attic in the middle of a hot summer when friends Jack White and Brendan Benson got together and wrote a song that truly inspired them. This song was 'Steady, As She Goes' and the inspiration led to the creation of a full band with the addition of Lawrence and Keeler.\" The band came together in Detroit during 2005 and recorded when time allowed for the remainder of the year. Due to the various members' success in other bands, they were quickly dubbed a supergroup. The band, however, asserted they were not, saying that the term implies something pre-planned or temporary, whereas they are actually \"a new band made up of old friends.\"\n\nThe band are known as \"The Saboteurs\" in the Australian market, due to a Queensland band already using the name \"Raconteurs\". The Queensland band refused to give up their name for the amount of money they were offered, and instead asked for a higher price from The Raconteurs' record company, who refused to pay the greater amount. A member of the Queensland band said that they had not been informed of who was trying to buy their name and asked for the larger sum of money to see what would happen.\n\nThe band has played a number of music festivals in Europe, Asia, and North America (including Oxegen in Ireland; Reading Festival, Leeds Festival, Glastonbury Festival, and T in the Park in the United Kingdom; Heineken Open'er Festival in Poland; Vegoose in Las Vegas; Lollapalooza in Chicago; Bonnaroo in Manchester, Tennessee; Austin City Limits Music Festival in Austin, Texas; Coachella in Indio, California; and Orlando Calling in Orlando, Florida), headlining many.\n\nThe Raconteurs' full-length debut, \"Broken Boy Soldiers\", was recorded at Brendan Benson's in-home studio located in Detroit. The first single was \"Steady, As She Goes/Store Bought Bones\" and was released as a limited-edition 7-inch, 45 rpm vinyl record in Europe on January 30, 2006, and in North America on March 7, 2006. A CD version of \"Steady, As She Goes\" was released on April 24, 2006, with the B-side \"Bane Rendition\".\n\nThe Raconteurs first performed live at the Academy in Liverpool, UK, on March 20, 2006, launching a short British tour. Their first American date was the following month, on April 20, at New York City's Irving Plaza. Nearly nonstop touring followed, bringing the band to audiences around North America and Europe. The high profile of Jack White meant that even though the band was new, they were able to sell out mid-size venues—a rarity for a band's first tour.\n\n\"Broken Boy Soldiers\" was released on May 15, 2006, in the UK on Third Man Recordings/XL Recordings and May 16 in the U.S. on Third Man Recordings/V2 Records. It entered the UK charts at No. 2 and the U.S. charts at No. 7.\n\nIn November 2006, the Raconteurs played eight dates as the opening act for Bob Dylan on the north-eastern leg of his U.S. tour. On November 3, 2006, the Raconteurs performed the song \"Store Bought Bones\" and the title track, \"Broken Boy Soldier\" on \"Later with Jools Holland\". According to \"Planet Sound\" (who had reporters in attendance), during \"Store Bought Bones\", White's guitar malfunctioned and they had to re-play the song. This eventually happened four times, with the band breaking up in laughter by the fourth take. The TV airing used edited pieces from all four performances and cut out any laughter. The band's cover of \"Teenage Kicks\" by The Undertones appeared on a 40-year anniversary of the BBC live compilation. They played it live on a John Peel tribute.\n\nThe band has performed a number of covers during live shows. For instance, the set list usually includes renditions of \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\" (a song written by Sonny Bono and popularized by both Cher and Nancy Sinatra) and \"Headin' for the Texas Border\" by The Flamin' Groovies. Other songs the band has covered include Gnarls Barkley's \"Crazy\", Bo Diddley's \"Who Do You Love?\", Ron Davies' \"It Ain´t Easy\", Love's \"A House Is Not a Motel\", and Charley Jordan's \"Keep It Clean\". The band has also covered the song \"Floating\" by the Irish band Jape, and \"Send Me a Postcard\", by Dutch band Shocking Blue. They have also performed an old Blues song written by Big Joe Williams in 1935 (popularized by Van Morrison's \"Them\" in 1964), \"Baby, Please Don't Go.\"\n\nIn December 2006, the band's debut album, \"Broken Boy Soldiers\", was awarded the title Album of the Year by Britain's \"Mojo\" magazine. In 2007, the album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album.

The Raconteurs announced an additional American show to play at The Tabernacle in Atlanta, Georgia on November 13, 2011. In April 2012, Third Man Records released two songs that were supposed to appear on Consolers of the Lonely: \"Open Your Eyes\" and \"You Make a Fool Out of Me\". The songs were re-recorded for Brendan Benson's next solo album 'My Old, Familiar Friend'. In February 2013, Jack White announced that the band was back in the studio recording new music. In March 2014, in an interview in The Guardian newspaper, Brendan Benson announced that a new album was \"kind of off the table\", suggesting that a new album was not currently in the works, and that the band's hiatus was more like a split.\n\nBenson and Lawrence joined White onstage during the encore of his January 28, 2015 concert at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, TN. They played \"Salute Your Solution\" and \"Steady, As She Goes\". Keeler was unable to join since he was on tour with The Afghan Whigs at the time.\n\nOn October 8, 2018, Third Man Records announced a deluxe reissue of \"Consolers of the Lonely\" through the label's Vault quarterly subscription service would feature two newly-recorded songs, \"Sunday Driver\" and \"Now That You're Gone\", on an accompanied 7-inch vinyl. Both songs were made available digitally on December 19 and subsequently were included on the 2019 album \"Help Us Stranger\". The album was released on June 21, 2019.\n\n\"Help Us Stranger\" was recorded at Third Man Studio in Nashville. White and Benson wrote all songs except for a cover of \"Hey Gyp (Dig The Slowness)\", by Donovan. The album was produced by The Raconteurs and engineered by Joshua V. Smith. Musical collaborators included Dean Fertita of The Dead Weather and Queens of the Stone Age and Lillie Mae and Scarlett Rische of Jypsi. The album was mixed by Vance Powell and The Raconteurs at Blackbird Studios in Nashville.\n\nThe band announced plans for a live album entitled \"Live in Tulsa,\" which was recorded live at Cain's Ballroom in Tulsa, Oklahoma from October 13, 2019 through October 16, 2019.\n\n\nTouring members\n\n"}

It was established in the United States by five private sector organizations, dedicated to guiding executive management and government entities in relevant aspects of organizational governance, business ethics, internal control, business risk management, fraud and financial reports. COSO has established a common internal control model against which companies and organizations can evaluate their control systems. COSO has the support of five support organizations: the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA), the American Accounting Association (AAA), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and Financial Executives International (FEI).\n\nCOSO was formed in 1985 to sponsor the National Fraudulent Financial Information Commission (the Treadway Commission). The Treadway Commission was originally sponsored and jointly funded by five major professional accounting associations and institutes based in the United States: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), American Accounting Association (AAA) , Financial Executives International (FEI), Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and Institute of Management Accountants (IMA). The Treadway Commission recommended that the sponsoring organizations of the Commission work together to develop an integrated guidance on internal control. These five organizations formed what is now called the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nThe original president of the Treadway Commission was James C. Treadway, Jr., Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Paine Webber and former Commissioner of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. UU. Hence the popular name \"Treadway Commission\". Robert B. Hirth, Jr. became the President of COSO at June 1, 2013. He held the position for 4.5 years. In February 1, 2018, Paul J. Sobel became the new president of COSO.\n\nDue to the questionable practices of financing corporate political campaigns and corrupt foreign practices in the mid-1970s, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Congress enacted reforms to the campaign finance law and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977 that criminalized transnational bribery and required companies to implement internal control programs. In response, the Treadway Commission, a private sector initiative, was formed in 1985 to inspect, analyze and make recommendations on fraudulent corporate financial reports.\n\nThe Treadway Commission studied the financial information system during the period from October 1985 to September 1987 and issued a report of findings and recommendations in October 1987, \"Report of the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Information.\" As a result of this initial report, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO)) was formed and retained Coopers & Lybrand, an important company CPA, to study the problems and write a report on an integrated internal control framework.\n\nIn September 1992, the four-volume report entitled \"Internal control: integrated framework\" was published by COSO and then published again with minor amendments in 1994. This report presented a common definition of internal control and provided a framework against which internal control systems can be evaluated and improved. This report is a standard that US companies use to assess their compliance with the FCPA. According to a survey conducted by the magazine `` CFO \" published in 2006, 82% of respondents said they used the COSO framework for internal controls. Other frameworks used by respondents included COBIT, AS2 (Audit Standard No. 2, PCAOB) and SAS 55/78 (AICPA).\n\nThe COSO framework involves several key concepts:\n\nThe COSO framework defines internal control as a process, carried out by the board of directors, the administration and other personnel of an entity, designed to provide \"reasonable security\" with respect to the achievement of objectives in the following categories:\n\nThe COSO internal control framework consists of five interrelated components derived from the way in which the administration manages a business. \" \" 'According to COSO, these components provide an effective framework to describe and analyze the internal control system implemented in an organization' \" \" as required by financial regulations (see Securities Exchange Act of 1934,) The five components are as follows:\n\n\" 'Control environment:' \" The control environment sets the tone of an organization, influencing the control consciousness of its people. It is the basis of all other components of internal control, providing discipline and structure. Factors in the control environment include integrity, ethical values, the operational style of administration, the delegation of authority systems, as well as the processes for managing and developing people in the organization.\n\n\" 'Risk assessment:' \" Each entity faces a variety of risks from external and internal sources that must be assessed. A prerequisite for risk assessment is the establishment of objectives and, therefore, risk assessment is the identification and analysis of risks relevant to the achievement of the assigned objectives. Risk assessment is a prerequisite for determining how risks should be managed. The four underlying principles related to risk assessment are that the organization should have clear objectives in order to be able to identify and assess the risks relating to those objectives; should determine how the risks should be managed; should consider the potential for fraudulent behavior; and should monitor changes that could impact internal controls.\n\n\" 'Control activities:' \" Control activities are the policies and procedures that help ensure that management directives are carried out. They help to ensure that the necessary measures are taken to address the risks that may hinder the achievement of the entity's objectives. Control activities occur throughout the organization, at all levels and in all functions. They include a range of activities as diverse as approvals, authorizations, verifications, reconciliations, operational performance reviews, asset safety and segregation of functions.\n\n\" 'Information and communication:' \" Information systems play a key role in internal control systems, as they produce reports, including operational, financial and compliance-related information, which make the operation and control of the business possible . In a broader sense, effective communication must ensure information flows down, across and up the organization. For example, the formalized procedures for individuals to report suspected fraud. Effective communication with external parties, such as customers, suppliers, regulators and shareholders on related political positions, must also be guaranteed.\n\n\" 'Monitoring' \": Internal control systems must be monitored, a process that evaluates the quality of system performance over time. This is achieved through continuous monitoring activities or separate evaluations. Internal control deficiencies detected through these monitoring activities must be reported upstream and corrective measures must be taken to ensure continuous improvement of the system.\n\nInternal control involves human action, which introduces the possibility of errors in prosecution or trial. Internal control can also be overridden by collusion among employees (see separation of duties) or coercion by senior management.\n\nThe magazine `` CFO \" reported that companies are struggling to apply the complex model provided by COSO. \"One of the biggest problems: limiting internal audits to one of the three key objectives of the framework. In the COSO model, these objectives apply to five key components (control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication , and monitoring \"Given the number of possible matrices, it is not surprising that the number of audits can get out of control.\" CFO magazine continued to state that many organizations are creating their own risk and control matrix by taking the COSO model and modifying it to focus on the components that relate directly to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley.\n\nIn 2001, COSO initiated a project and hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to develop a framework that administrations could easily use to evaluate and improve the business risk management of their organizations. High-profile commercial scandals and failures (eg, Enron, Tyco International, Adelphia, Peregrine Systems and WorldCom) generated calls to improve corporate governance and risk management. As a result, Sarbanes-Oxley Law was enacted. This law extends the long-standing requirement for public companies to maintain internal control systems, which requires management to certify and the independent auditor to certify the effectiveness of those systems. The \" Internal Control - Integrated Framework \" continues to serve as the `` widely accepted standard \" to meet those reporting requirements; however, in 2004 COSO published \"Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework\". COSO believes that this framework is expanded in internal control, providing a more robust and extensive approach to the broader issue of business risk management.\n\nThis business risk management framework is still aimed at achieving the objectives of an entity; However, the framework now includes four categories:\n\nThe eight components of business risk management encompass the five previous components of the Integrated Internal Control Framework while expanding the model to meet the growing demand for risk management:\n\n\" 'Internal environment:' \" The internal environment encompasses the tone of an organization and establishes the basis of how risk is seen and addressed by the persons of an entity, including the risk management philosophy and risk appetite , integrity and ethical values, and the environment in which they operate.\n\n\" 'Setting objectives:' \" The objectives must exist before management can identify potential events that affect its achievement. Business risk management ensures that management has implemented a process to establish objectives and that the chosen objectives support and align with the mission of the entity and are consistent with its appetite for risk.\n\n\" 'Event identification' \": Internal and external events that affect the achievement of the objectives of an entity must be identified, distinguishing between risks and opportunities. The opportunities are re-channeled into management strategy or goal-setting processes.\n\n\" 'Risk assessment:' \" The risks are analyzed, considering the probability and impact, as a basis for determining how they should be managed. The risks are inherently and residually assessed.\nPost comments\nRecord\nSaved\nCommunity\n\n\" 'Risk response:' \" Management selects risk responses, avoiding, accepting, reducing or sharing risk, developing a set of actions to align risks with the entity's risk appetite and risk appetite.\n\n\" 'Control activities:' \" Policies and procedures are established and implemented to help ensure that risk responses are carried out effectively.\n\n\" 'Information and communication:' \" The relevant information is identified, captured and communicated in a way and time frame that allow people to fulfill their responsibilities. Effective communication also occurs in a broader sense, flowing down, through and up the entity.\n\n\" 'Monitoring:' \" The entire business risk management is monitored and modifications are made as necessary. Monitoring is achieved through ongoing management activities, separate evaluations or both.\n\nCOSO believes that \" Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework \" provides a clearly defined interrelation between the components and risk management objectives of an organization that will satisfy the need to comply with the new laws, regulations and standards of listing and waiting that companies accept it widely. and other organizations and stakeholders.\n\nCOSO admits in its report that, although business risk management provides significant benefits, there are limitations. Business risk management depends on human judgment and, therefore, is susceptible to decision making. Human failures, such as simple errors or errors, can lead to inadequate risk responses. In addition, controls can be avoided by collusion of two or more people, and management has the ability to override business risk management decisions. These limitations prevent a board and management from having absolute security regarding the achievement of the entity's objectives.\n\nPhilosophically, COSO is more oriented towards controls. Therefore, it has a bias towards risks that could have a negative impact instead of the risks of missing opportunities. See ISO 31000.\n\nWhile COSO states that its expanded model provides more risk management, companies are not required to change to the new model if they are using the Integrated Internal Control Framework.\n\nThis document contains guidance to help smaller public companies to apply the concepts of 1992 Internal Control - Integrated Framework. This publication shows the applicability of these concepts to help smaller public companies design and implement internal controls to support the achievement of financial information objectives. It highlights 20 key principles of the 1992 framework, providing a principles-based approach to internal control. As explained in the publication, the 2006 guideline applies to entities of all sizes and types.\n\nCompanies have invested heavily in improving the quality of their internal controls; However, COSO noted that many organizations do not fully understand the importance of the monitoring component of the COSO framework and the role it plays in streamlining the evaluation process. In January 2009, COSO published its \"Guidance on the monitoring of internal control systems\" to clarify the internal control monitoring component.\n\nOver time, effective monitoring can lead to organizational efficiencies and reduced costs associated with public information about internal control because problems are identified and addressed proactively, rather than reactively.\n\nThe COSO Monitoring Guide is based on two fundamental principles originally established in the 2006 COSO Guide:\n\nThe monitoring guide also suggests that these principles are best achieved through monitoring based on three general elements:\n\nInternal auditors play an important role in assessing the effectiveness of control systems. As an independent function that informs senior management, internal audit can evaluate the internal control systems implemented by the organization and contribute to continued effectiveness. As such, internal auditing often plays an important \"monitoring\" role. To preserve its independence of judgment, the internal audit should not assume any direct responsibility in the design, establishment or maintenance of the controls that it is supposed to evaluate. You can only advise on possible improvements to be made.\n\n1141/5000\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Law, management and external auditors must report on the adequacy of the company's internal control over financial information. Audit Standard No. 5, published by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, requires that auditors \"use the same appropriate and recognized control framework to conduct their internal control audit on the financial information that management uses to its annual evaluation of the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial information. \" Section 143 (3) (i) of the Indian Companies Act, 2013 also requires Legal Auditors to comment on internal control over financial information\n\nIn November 2010, COSO announced a project to review and update the \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" to make it more relevant in the increasingly complex business environment. The five components of the framework remain the same. A new feature in the updated framework is that the internal control concepts introduced in the original framework will now be coded into 17 principles explicitly listed among five components. The Changes in the framework include internal controls over technology, such as email and the Internet, which were not widely used. when the original framework was published in 1992.\nTogether with the updated Framework, COSO intends to publish the following documents:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2009102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009102", "title": "Yin Shun", "text": "Yin Shun\n\n(Master) Yin Shun (印順導師, \"Yìnshùn Dǎoshī\") (5 April 1906 – 4 June 2005) was a well-known Buddhist monk and scholar in the tradition of Chinese Mahayana Buddhism. Though he was particularly trained in the Three Treatise school, he was an advocate of the One Vehicle (or Ekayana) as the ultimate and universal perspective of Buddhahood for all, and as such included all schools of Buddha Dharma, including the Five Vehicles and the Three Vehicles, within the meaning of the Mahayana as the One Vehicle. Yin Shun's research helped bring forth the ideal of \"Humanistic\" (human-realm) Buddhism, a leading mainstream Buddhist philosophy studied and upheld by many practitioners. His work also regenerated the interests in the long-ignored Āgamas among Chinese Buddhist society and his ideas are echoed by Theravadin teacher Bhikkhu Bodhi. As a contemporary master, he was most popularly known as the mentor of Cheng Yen (Pinyin: Zhengyan), the founder of Tzu-Chi Buddhist Foundation, as well as the teacher to several other prominent monastics.\n\nAlthough Master Yin Shun is closely associated with the Tzu-Chi Foundation, he has had a decisive influence on others of the new generation of Buddhist monks such as Sheng-yen of Dharma Drum Mountain and Hsing Yun of Fo Guang Shan, who are active in humanitarian aid, social work, environmentalism and academic research as well. He is considered to be one of the most influential figures of Taiwanese Buddhism, having influenced many of the leading Buddhist figures in modern Taiwan.\n\nYin Shun was born on 5 April, 1906 (The traditional Chinese calendar: March 12, 丙午) in a village in Zhejiang Province, China. His birth name was Zhang Luqin (Wade–Giles: Chang Luch'in). At the time of Zhang's birth, it was the end of the Qing Dynasty. Eleven days after his birth, Zhang was critically ill and nearly died. He began school at age seven.\n\nIn his studies, he stumbled upon the subject of immortality—a subject that Zhang found interesting. His parents found what Zhang was doing to be very unusual, so they required him to teach at other schools.\n\nZhang turned his attention to Confucianism and Taoism, but neither of their philosophies could help him find the truth. At one point, Christianity sparked light into his heart. However, Zhang still felt empty, and could not commit himself to Christianity after two years. One day, Zhang was looking for something to read. He stumbled onto the words \"the Buddha Dharma\". This immediately sparked interest into his heart again, like what Christianity did for him, and Zhang zealously looked for anything that had to do with Buddhism.\n\nIn 1930, Zhang applied to a Buddhist college in Beijing. For many days he had traveled from his home to Beijing, with high hopes. He arrived too late for acceptance.\n\nWhile pondering where he could go next, Zhang thought of a temple called \"Tiantong Temple\". Zhang then went to Mount Putuo, where he met a young man named Wang. Both searched for an abode where they could study the Buddha Dharma. They eventually found a small place where they could do so, where their abbot who was well cultivated. They asked to study under him.\n\nThe elder monk then referred Zhang and Wang to another place called Fuzhun Monastery (福泉庵), less than a half mile from where they were. The two hurried to Fuzhun Monastery. Later, on October 11, 1930, the abbot, Master Qingnian (清念和尚), shaved Zhang Luqin's head and gave him the Dharma name of \"Yin Shun\" (印順).\n\nMaster Taixu 太虛 (1890–1947) divided Mahayana Buddhism into three types. They are: School of śūnyatā and prajña (faxing konghui zong 法性空慧宗, Madhyamaka), School of dharmalaksana and vijnaptimatra (faxiang weishi zong 法相唯識宗) and School of dharma-dhatu and perfect enlightenment (fajie yuanjue zong 法界圓覺宗). Furthermore, he states that dharma-dhatu is on the highest level, complete and the final dharma. On the following levels are Madhyamaka and Vijnaptimatra.\n\nBy contrast, Yinshun 印順 (1906–2005), Tiaxu’s disciple, took a different direction from that of his teacher. He claims that Mahayana Buddhism can be divided into three systems. They are: School of śūnyatā and name only (xingkong 性空唯名系, Madhyamaka), School of illusion and Vijñapti-mātra (weishi 虛妄唯識系, Vijñapti-mātra) and School of genuine and permanent mind (zhenchang 真常唯心系, Tathāgata-garbha).\n\nFor him, early Mahayana Buddhism is characterized by Nāgārjuna’s 龍樹 prajñapāramitā thought. Mahayana Buddhism, in its middle stage, is characterized by Vijñapti-mātra which was upheld by Asanga and Vasubandhu. Later Mahayana Buddhism is mainly characterized by Tathāgata-garbha thought 如來藏思想. Therefore, it is clear that Yinshun distanced himself from his teacher’s position. \n\nIn March 2004, he was awarded the Order of Propitious Clouds Second Class, for his contributions to the revitalization of Buddhism in Taiwan.\n\nOn February 1963, a thirty-two-day novitiate for Buddhist monks and nuns was held in Taipei. Monks and nuns came from all over Taiwan to register. All were accepted except a young female devotee from Hualien, a county in eastern Taiwan.\n\nMaster Yin Shun recalled the day he first met Master Cheng Yen:\n\n¹At the time, Yin Shun only had three disciples. All three now are teaching the Buddha Dharma in the United States.\n\nMaster Yin Shun then said to her, \"Our karmic relationship is very special. As a nun, you must always be committed to Buddhism and to all living beings.\"\n\nSince the registration for the novitiate was about to end within the hour, the venerable master quickly gave the young disciple her Buddhist name, \"Cheng Yen\", and told her to get going and begin the novitiate promptly. At that moment, the conditions for the creation of the Tzu-Chi Foundation began.\n\nIn the summer of 1979, Master Yin Shun came to Hualien. Living in this beautiful but undeveloped part of the island, Cheng Yen told Master Yin Shun about her aspiration to build a high-quality hospital for the people living in eastern Taiwan, where there were few medical facilities.\n\nAs he listened to her, he could foresee the daunting challenges lying ahead. Like a father sharing his life experiences with his daughter, he said, \"Just like the time you told me you intended to begin charity work, I reminded you to think whether you would have the strength and the money when more people came to you for help. The task can only be realized with unwavering commitment.\" \n\nSeeing his disciple's resolution, Master Yin Shun's mind was put at ease. With this talk, the hospital construction project began. Although Cheng Yen would soon face many insurmountable difficulties and challenges, Master Yin Shun's support gave Cheng Yen the strength to go on. He transferred virtually all the monetary offerings made to him by his followers to the hospital construction. The sum accumulated throughout the years was truly sizable.\n\nOn June 4, 2005, Master Yin Shun died after fighting pulmonary tuberculosis since 1954. He died in Tzu-Chi hospital in Hualien at the age of 100. In Taiwan, many were stunned to hear of his death, even though his death was expected in the coming months. Tzu-Chi, along with other Buddhist organizations and monasteries influenced by Yin Shun, joined in mourning for eight days, the length of his funeral.\n\nAmong those attending the services were Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian, ROC Premier Frank Hsieh, and other legislators. Several monastics from many parts of the world, predominantly the United States, also attended Master Yin Shun's funeral. Monastics who were disciples of Master Yin Shun also attended the funeral, including Master Cheng Yen herself.\n\nMaster Yin Shun had a simple and spartan lifestyle in the last days of his life, so his disciples decided to keep his funeral simple but solemn. His funeral was held at Fu Yan Vihara in Hsinchu, where he had lived for many years until his death. Master Yin Shun was later cremated on June 10 and his ashes and his portrait used during the services were placed inside a hall alongside the remains of other monastics.\n\n\n\n"}

A drum wrench is a convenient tool for safely opening and removing materials from 55 gallon drums, but they are certainly not the only means of protection from the hazards of said drums. Some drums act as a vacuum with very low internal pressures, increasing the risk of the top \"popping up\" soon after opening.

The book is edited by William Irwin, Mark T. Conard and Aeon J. Skoble, each of whom also wrote one of the eighteen essays in the book.\n\nThe book was released on February 28, 2001, as the second volume of Open Court Publishing's Popular Culture and Philosophy series, which currently includes eighty books. The book has gone on to be extremely successful, both in sales and critically, and is also used as a main text in various universities with philosophy courses.\n\nThe book includes contributions from eighteen academics in the field of philosophy. Topics included are comparisons of the characters in the show, such as Homer Simpson and Aristotle, or Bart Simpson and Friedrich Nietzsche. The book brings up topics such as why Homer's appeal is universal by arguing that he speaks to fundamental conflicts about what gives human pleasure.\n\nOther topics include the manner in which the show makes philosophical statements, and its opinions on sexuality in politics. Religion is also discussed in the book, such as the guilt Homer feels for not going to church, or Ned Flanders experiencing tragedies, despite following the Bible closely.\n\nThe book was highly successful, selling over 203,000 copies, making it the best selling book in the Open Court Publishing's Popular Culture and Philosophy series. The book was also critically successful, highlighting the philosophical themes that the book was able to make with \"The Simpsons\", such as \"Booklist\", who wrote, \"[...]these pieces make erudite concepts accessible by viewing things through the lens of a great cartoon series,\" or \"Publishers Weekly\" who wrote, \"Fans of The Simpsons are certain to find this book to be the perfect rebuttal for those who dismiss the show as a no-brainer.\"\n\nAt Siena Heights University a course titled \"Animated Philosophy and Religion\" uses the book as one of the main texts in order to help teach philosophy. The book has been praised for being able to make connections to philosophical studies and to youth, by using popular culture. The professors who use the book say the book \"helps draw people to philosophy.\" A course titled \"Simpsons and Philosophy\", devoted entirely to the show & philosophy, is offered at the University of California, Berkeley as part of the university's controversial DeCal program in which students take courses taught by their peers.\n\nSteve Carroll of \"The Age\" criticized the book and others like it for watering down philosophical content while making tenuous connections with popular themes in order to maximize appeal to consumers. The book was satirized in an article titled \"The 'Popular Culture and Philosophy' Books and Philosophy: Philosophy, You’ve Officially Been Pimped\", in the online journal \"Flow TV\".\n\n"}

Its registers include a wide range of material on the political, administrative, economic and social affairs of Scotland. The council supervised the administration of the law, regulated trade and shipping, took emergency measures against the plague, granted licences to travel, administered oaths of allegiance, banished beggars and Gypsies, dealt with witches, recusants, Covenanters and Jacobites and tackled the problem of lawlessness in the Highlands and the Borders.\n\nLike the Parliament, the Council was a development of the King's Council. The King's Council, or \"curia regis\", was the court of the monarch surrounded by his royal officers and others upon whom he relied for advice. It is known to have existed in the thirteenth century, if not earlier, but has left little trace of its activities. \n\nBy the later fifteenth century the council had advisory, executive and judicial functions though surviving records are mainly confined to the last. It is at this period that the 'secret' or privy council makes its formal appearance when, in February 1490, parliament elected 2 bishops, an abbot or prior, 6 barons and 8 royal officers to form the king's council \"for the ostensioun and forthputting of the King's authorite in the administracioun of justice\". \n\nThe \"Lords of Secret Council\", as they were known, were part of the general body of Lords of Council, like the Lords of Session and Lords Auditors of Exchequer. After 1532 much of the judicial business was transferred to the newly founded College of Justice, the later Court of Session. The council met regularly and was particularly active during periods of a monarch's minority. A separate register of the privy council appears in 1545 and probably marks the point at which the secret council split off from its parent body.\n\nAfter 1603 James VI was able to boast to the English Parliament that he governed Scotland \"with my pen\". The council received his written instructions and executed his will. This style of government, continued by his grandsons Charles II and James VII, was disrupted during the reign of Charles I by the Covenanters and the Cromwellian occupation. There are gaps in the register during the upheavals of 1638–41 when the council was largely displaced by an alternative administration set up by the Covenanters and during the Cromwellian period, the council ceased to act at all. \n\nAfter the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II nominated his own privy councillors and set up a council in London through which he directed affairs in Edinburgh, a situation that continued after the Glorious Revolution of 1688–9. The council survived the Act of Union but for one year only. It was abolished on 1 May 1708 by the Parliament of Great Britain and thereafter there was one Privy Council of Great Britain sitting in London.\n\nUntil 1707, the Privy Council met in what is now the West Drawing Room at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. It was called the Council Chamber in the 17th century.\n\nThe Register of the Privy Council of Scotland (1545–1689) was edited and published between 1877 and 1970 by John Hill Burton, David Masson, Peter Hume Brown and Henry Macleod Paton.\n\nThe President of the Privy Council was one of the Great Officers of State in Scotland. The Lord Chancellor presided over the Council ex officio, but in 1610 James VI decreed that the President of the College of Justice should preside in the Chancellor's absence, and by 1619 the additional title of President of the Privy Council had been added. The two presidencies were separated in 1626 as part of Charles I's reoganisation of the Privy Council and Court of Session. The Lord President of the Council was accorded precedence as one of the King's chief officers in 1661, but appeared in the Estates of Parliament only intermittently.\n\"office abolished in 1708\"\n\nThe Register of the Privy Council of Scotland (edited and abridged) – 2nd Series (incomplete)\nOther links\n"}

The creek is only several kilometres long and eventually meets the North Para River at . The watercourse is studded with ancient and picturesque River Red Gums.\n\nIt was first discovered (but not named) by Europeans in December 1837 by an expedition led Colonel William Light and was surveyed in 1839 by his assistant surveyor, William Jacob (1814–1902), as part of a wider survey of the Barossa region. Jacob settled here in the early 1840s, hence the origin of the name. In the local aboriginal dialect it is called \"Cowieaurita\", meaning \"yellow-brown water\", in an area known to them as Moorooroo, which became the name of the Hundred.\n\nIn the early 1840s Jacob's Creek was briefly home to Johann Menge, South Australia's first geologist, who lived for some time on an island and in nearby cave on the creek. Here he grew vegetables, and was particularly struck with the possibilities for viticulture. Menge was influential in facilitating the settlement from the Barossa Valley by German Lutheran immigrants.\n\nThe creek lent its name to the famous wine brand Jacob's Creek, which is produced by Orlando Wines, located southwest along the Barossa Valley Highway in the small town of Rowland Flat. Johann Gramp, the founder of Orlando Wines, first planted grape vines on the banks of Jacob's Creek in 1847.\n\nIn 1997 Orlando Wines, in conjunction with the Northern Adelaide and Barossa Catchment Water Management Board, commenced a rejuvenation project for Jacobs Creek. All non-native plants and trees, such as bamboo, ash, and olives were removed, and replanted with blue gums, red gums and other Australian native trees and shrubs. As a result of the project, many native species of frogs, native fish, and waterbirds have returned, with the creek gradually returning to its former natural state.\n\n"}

She also had one sister named Eva. Leiber was sent to King's College London in 1938 by her family to study chemistry for the cosmetics industry, in part since her father thought she would be safer in London in the case of a war.\n\nShe returned to Hungary before World War II, where thanks to family connections she obtained a traineeship at a handbag company, where she learned to cut and mold leather, make patterns, frame and stitch bags. She was the first woman graduated to master craftswoman, becoming the first woman to join the Hungarian Handbag Guild in Budapest.\n\nShe avoided Nazi persecution when she escaped the Holocaust of World War II to the safety of a house set aside for Swiss citizens, when her father, a Hungarian Jew who managed the grain department of a bank, was able to obtain a Swiss \"schutzpass\", a document that gave the bearer safe passage. This pass is on view at the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC. The flat where Leiber survived the war housed 26 people.\n\nIn December 1944, those living in the apartment were taken to one of the Hungarian Nazi-run ghettos. After the liberation of Hungary by the Red Army, Leiber's family moved into a basement with 60 other people.\n\nIn 1946, she married Gerson Leiber (Gus), who was a sergeant in the United States Army serving in Eastern Europe. They met when she was making purses for the secretaries of the American Legation in Budapest, and they moved to New York City in 1947. He was an abstract expressionist painter, member of the National Academy of Design, with some of his works displayed at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Museum, the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, and other institutions.\n\nAfter working as a handbag designer for other companies, Leiber founded her own business in 1963. She is known for her crystal \"minaudières\", evening purses made of a metal shell often encrusted with Swarovski crystals, plated with silver or gold and with various forms, such as baby pigs, slices of watermelon, cupcakes, peacocks, penguins, and snakes. Sold at exclusive boutiques around the world, her purses may cost up to several thousand dollars and have become a status symbol for many women, including several Presidential First Ladies to whom she has given them as a present, from Mamie Eisenhower to Barbara Bush and Hillary Clinton. Animals are a recurring theme in her designs, and often ornament the most expensive purses of the collection, with prices on some animal-shaped minaudières exceeding US$7,000. Some wealthy women collect them; Bernice Norman, an arts patron in New Orleans, owns close to 300 of the Leiber bags.\n\nIn 1994, Leiber received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers. She retired in 1998. In September 2008, she was rated the most prestigious luxury handbag brand for the second year running by the New York-based Luxury Institute. In 2010, Leiber received a Visionary Woman Award from Moore College of Art & Design. Examples of her work can be found in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The Taubman Museum of Art in Roanoke, Virginia, has had a gallery of her work on display since it opened in 2008.\n\nThe Leibers bought property in Springs, New York in 1956 and it became their primary residence in 2011. In 2005 they opened the Leiber Museum across the street from their home to display the bags as well as paintings by Gerson Leiber. The Leibers sought to buy back an example of all of the purses to be displayed at the museum. The museum also displays various awards including the 1973 Coty Award.\n\nThe Judith Leiber boutiques are exclusive as there are only four in the world. They are located in New Delhi, Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. However, some of her collection is available at selected fashion stores like Neiman Marcus, Harvey Nichols, Lane Crawford, Holt Renfrew and Harrods.\n\nLeiber died at her home in Springs, New York, on April 28, 2018, just a few hours after her husband Gerson Leiber had died.\n\n"}

He served as a Senator in the 1990s, becoming President of the Senate before winning the Cakaudrove West Fijian Communal Constituency in the House of Representatives in a byelection in 1996.

The last time prior to his death that anyone was \"officially\" installed as Vunivalu of Natewa was in September 1974 when Lotaropate Rakuita Saurara (1908-1985 - a.k.a.

It is in the civil parish of Lyminge.\nThe village has a standard golf course noted for its hills, as well as a pub restaurant called The New Inn which claims to be the closest pub to the Channel Tunnel. Village facilities include a basketball court, two football goals, and a village hall. A large BT Group communication mast, which was used as a telecommunication relay during the Cold War, still stands in the village.\n\nThe hamlet of Etchinghill lies at the southern end of the Parish of Lyminge. Its original name was Tettinghelde 1240 (Tetta’s slope). A spring rises to the north side of Westfield Lane, (the road to Tolsford Hill) and the resultant stream flows across the fields to join up with the Nailbourne that rises in Well Field, Lyminge. This stream is known as the East Brook and probably in the Saxon period, when the settlement got its name of Tetinghelde, the volume of water would have been much greater. By the 15th Century the hamlet’s name had altered to “Etynghyld” and “Etynghyll”. Later known as Eachendhill or Etchinghole before settling to become Etchinghill. For centuries the hamlet remained a small farming community around the cross-roads, one of which led to Dover; one going south to Hythe and north to the village of Lyminge where the church is; the track up Westfield Lane over Tolsford Hill led people to West Hythe no doubt, but the importance of this waned as the coastline altered; and a final lane (now vanished) led to Newington.\n\nOver the years the hamlet has grown with additional development on all four of the roads leading from the crossroads, the establishment of a cricket club and, more recently, the creation of a golf course spreading across the land which separates Etchinghill from Lyminge.\n\nTo the North-East of the Village are the remains of the Elham Valley Railway, characterised by steep-sided cuttings and tunnels. The line which ran from Canterbury to the port of Folkestone, was closed in 1947 and dismantled between 1950 and 1954. \nThe line is crossed by Teddars Leas Road (bridge) and Badger's Bridge as well as the Golf Course.\nAlthough there was no station in Etchinghill, villagers could catch the train by travelling to the neighbouring village of Lyminge, approximately 2 miles to the North via road or one of the many public footpaths.\n\nDuring the war, Etchinghill was home to the \"Boche Buster\", a large rail-mounted gun which could be retracted into one of the many tunnels to provide cover from aerial photography and German bombing raids, and which gained a certain notoriety owing to its large size (there were other large rail-mounted guns in service, but none of 18 inch bore).\n\nThe Elham Valley Railway was requisitioned during the war as a military railway. With a range of around 12 miles, the gun was designed to attack invading German forces whilst still in mid-channel. Some sources still claim that the Boche Buster had a range of over 30 miles and could fire across the channel into German-occupied France. This was not the case, although it shared a considerable amount of history with a set of 13.5 inch railway guns also stationed in Kent, which were capable of firing into German-occupied France. The gun's location and operation were considered secret, and it was initially transported to Kent disguised (by camouflage) as a banana freight train.\n\nUntil the early 1990s, the village was dominated by St Mary's Hospital. This was constructed in 1836 by the Elham Poor Law Union as the workhouse for the surrounding area, including the towns of Folkestone and Hythe. Prior to this each parish had relieved the poor the best way they could, usually by allowing them to remain in their own homes and giving them outdoor relief, although Elham and Newington each had a small local workhouse facility. In 1834 Parliament passed the Poor Law Amendment Act and suggested parishes might group together and provide cross-community facilities. This led to the foundation of the Elham Poor Law Union in 1835, and the building of the workhouse at Etchinghill in 1836 at a cost of £6,500.\n\nDesigned by architect Sir Francis Head, the workhouse was designed to accommodate 300 inmates. In 1841 an additional building had been erected to provide food and temporary accommodation to some of the many vagrants who wandered the countryside. Despite its large size, it was considerably extended in 1890, with the addition of new dormitory wards, an infirmary, and a chapel.\n\nFollowing the closure of the workhouse in 1947, the buildings passed to the National Health Service, and were re-opened as St Mary's Hospital, specialising in geriatric care. There was also a hospital annexe providing isolation facilities for patients with highly infectious diseases. The hospital was helped by community volunteers who included hospital visitors (who befriended patients), the local St. John Ambulance (who provided qualified auxiliary nurses for routine nursing and bed making duties throughout the 1980s), and a very active League of Friends (who raised money to provide many additional comforts for the residents), active from 1962 until the hospital's closure.\n\nSt Mary’s hospital was closed in 1990 and all the buildings, with the exception of the un-consecrated chapel, were demolished. 52 houses now occupy approximately two thirds of the land, with a new village hall and amenity land for all to enjoy taking up the remainder of the land. The hospital chapel, the last remaining physical element, has been converted into a private house.\n\n"}

He founded property search company Garrington Home Finders Ltd in 1996. He describes himself as not the first to see this opportunity \"but I was probably second or third, and Kirstie [Allsopp] was the fourth.\" The company entered into liquidation in early 2009, a victim of the credit crunch that followed the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

{"id": "2009196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009196", "title": "Coat of arms of Switzerland", "text": "Coat of arms of Switzerland\n\nThe coat of arms of the Swiss Confederation shows the same white-on-red cross as the flag of Switzerland, but on a heraldic shield instead of the square field.\n\nThe federal coat of arms (\"eidgenössisches Wappen\") was defined by the Swiss Diet (\"Tagsatzung\") in 1815 for the Restored Confederacy. A more elaborate federal seal was also defined, as the federal coat of arms surrounded by the twenty-two cantonal coats of arms. Similar heraldic arrangements representing the Thirteen Cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy are on record from the mid-16th century.\n\nThe 1815 legislation remained in force in the federal state established in 1848, as was explicitly recognized by the Federal Council in 1889. While the simple coat of arms was in wide use, especially on coins, and from the early 20th century also on car number plates and passports, the full seal did not see official use beyond its representation in stained glass in the Federal Palace of Switzerland (c. 1900).\nThe 19th-century definition of the federal seal and coat of arms was replaced only in 2017, with the adoption of a new law\nwhich defined the Swiss coat of arms as \"a Swiss cross in a triangular shield\" with fixed proportions, but which no longer recognizes a federal seal.\n\nThe 2017 law defines the \"Swiss coat of arms\" (German: \"Schweizerwappen\") formally the \"Coat of Arms of the Swiss Confederation\" (, , )\nas \"a Swiss cross in a triangular shield\". The Swiss cross (, , ) is defined as \nThe shape of the \"triangular shield\" is defined by means of an image given in an annex to article 2.\nThe color red to be used is specified in the same annex as:\n\nThe triangular shield has been in use by the federal administration since the first half of the 20th century.\nIt is an unusual shape, based on the triangular or \"heater\" shaped shield of classical heraldry, but with a curved top.\n\nAlternative shapes of the heraldic shield were also in frequent use, and still remain in use in spite of the 2017 legislation. \nA frequently seen shield shape is the \"Iberian\" or \"curved\" type, specifically used to mark Swiss embassies and border crossings, and also used on the five franks coin. \nAnother frequently seen variant is a Renaissance-style articulated shield, shown as being held by the national personification Helvetia on the ½, 1 and 2 franks coins.\n\nThe Swiss cross originates as a field sign worn by the troops of the Old Swiss Confederacy. Use of the emblem is attested with certainty in the context of the Old Zürich War, for the year 1444, when the \"Tagsatzung\" defended itself against allegations that the troops of the Confederacy had deceptively used two different field signs (\"Heerzeichen\"). Aegidius Tschudi (\"Chronik II.390) cites a song containing this allegation, specifying that the Swiss were bearing \"two kinds of crosses, white at the back and red in front\" (\"Si trügend zweierlei Crützeren, [...] Hinden wiß und vornen rot\") to deceive the Zürich side.\n\nHeraldic representation of the Confederacy was by representations of the cantonal coats of arms. Petermann Etterlin on the of his \"Kronika\" of 1507 shows the coats of arms of the Thirteen Cantons (besides those of Chur, Valais and St. Gallen) surrounding the imperial coat of arms, reflecting the claim of the cantons of the Confederacy to imperial immediacy within the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe first known example where the cantonal coats of arms are shown as surrounding a Swiss cross representing the Confederacy is a medal commissioned by the \"Tagsatzung\" from Zürich goldsmith Hans Stampfer in 1547 as a gift for the French princess Claude. The obverse side of this medal shows the coats of arms of the Thirteen Cantons in their order of precedence, the reverse shows the coats of arms of the Associates, both groups surrounding a central cross with ornamental foliage. Similar representations are found throughout the early modern period, on commemorative medals and on regimental seals used by Swiss Guards in French service.\nThe first mention of the \"Confederate Cross\" (\"Eidgenossen Crütz\") shown in a shield (on pennies minted by Schwyz) dates to 1533.\n\nThe Napoleonic Helvetic Republic adopted an official seal on 12 May 1798, showing William Tell and his son, holding the apple pierced by the crossbow bolt.\nThis seal disappeared with the dissolution of the Helvetic Republic five years later. The Swiss Confederation established by Napoleon in 1803 adopted the seal, described as: \"an armed Old Swiss, on whose shield shall be inscribed 'XIX. Kantone', surrounded by the inscription 'Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft. 1803.'\".\nThe Tagsatzung (Swiss Diet) re-introduced the white cross in the red field for the seal of the Confederacy in 1814. The commission for drafting a federal constitution on 16 May 1814 recommended the adoption of a seal of the Confederacy based on the \"field sign of the old Swiss\".\nOn 4 July 1815, the Diet accepted the design of the commission, adopting it as the provisional seal and describing it as \"in the center, the federal red shield with the white cross as common federal heraldic emblem, surrounded by a simple circular Gothic ornament, on the outside of which the inscription 'Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft' with the year number MDCCCXV, and in an outer circle all XXII cantonal coat of arms in circular fields, according to their federal order of precedence; around all, a simple wreath\".\n\nIn November 1889, the Federal Council published a \"communication regarding the federal coat of arms\", detailing the history of the use of the Swiss cross since the 15th century.\n\nSeals produced from 1815 onward, and cantonal coins minted from 1826 showed the arms of the cross in the 7:6 length to width ratio. Later in the 19th century, there was a trend of depicting the cross as composed of five equal squares. The two competing designs were controversially discussed in the late 19th century, especially after the introduction of the new design for the five franks coin, which showed the Swiss coat of arms in a Baroque-style heraldic shield. The Federal Council in 1889 introduced the 7:6 ratio as official. The associated communication explains that \"our heraldic cross is not a mathematical figure, but at the same the Christian cross symbol and the field sign of the Old Confederacy\". The 1889 law avoids specification of the shape of the shield, the omission being explained in the communication as deliberate, in order to avoid prejudicing the ongoing controversy, and in order to enable the shape of the shield to be left to the \"tastes of the current time and practical necessity\".\nThe legislation, passed on 12 December 1889 (SR 111), explicitly invokes the \"Tagsatzung\" decision of 1815 as retaining validity, with the only addition of specifying the proportions of the cross, the four arms having equal length, in a ratio to their width of .\n\nIn the 1850 series of the Swiss franc coins, the small denominations (1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 centimes) had a coat of arms with floral ornaments, while the larger denominations (½, 1, 2 and 5 francs) showed a seated Helvetia figure holding a triangular shield on which the Swiss cross was displayed within an oval shape. The coat of arms in the denominations 5, 10 and 20 centimes was replaced by a female head (Liberty) in 1881. In the 1 and 2 centimes coins, the coat of arms was replaced by a simple Swiss cross in 1948.\nFor the ½, 1, and 2 francs coins, the seated Helvetia was replaced by her standing figure in 1875.\nThe 1888 five franks coin showed a coat of arms with a heraldic shield in a shape inspired by Baroque cartouche designs. The 1922 design of the five franks coin introduced a simplified shield of the rounded \"\" type.\n\nThe Model 1900/06 Parabellum pistol (\"Swiss Luger\") had a Swiss cross engraved on the top of the chamber.\nThe Swiss cross was represented as \"in splendor\" in the batches produced during 1906–1908, and in a heraldic shield from 1909.\nThe heraldic shield was of the \"baroque\" type, with an engrailed top, in the 1900/06 models produced from 1909–1914 by Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken (DWM). The coat of arms is no longer present in the model 1900/06 batches produced by Waffenfabrik Bern during 1918–1933.\nThe Swiss coat of arms is again present on the Model 1929 Parabellum pistol made by Waffenfabrik Bern during 1933–1947, now with a triangular shield. Ordnance pistols produced for the army, models SIG Sauer P210 (1949–1975) and SIG Sauer P220 (from 1975) continued to have the Swiss coat of arms with triangular shield engraved on the slide, rendered in simple outline (without hatching of the shield).\n\nThe representation of the Swiss coat of arms in a convex triangular shield representing the federal administration is a tradition introduced in the early 20th century. \nThis special shield shape had no official force prior to the adoption as \"logo\" in 2005, but it came to be used \"de facto\" as emblem by the federal authorities from the 1930s, shown on Swiss passports during 1932–1984 (the passport of 1915 still showed a coat of arms with a \"\" style shield in a wreath on its first page).\nEarly Swiss car registration plates, introduced in 1905, showed coats of arms with articulate \"Baroque\" shields.\n\nBeginning in 1933, this design was replaced by simplified a shield shape of the \"triangular\" type with vertical sides, with slight design variations between cantons.\n\nThe Federal Council in 2004 announced the introduction of a \"corporate design\" in the sense of a contemporary logo, to be used by all organs of the federal administration.\nAdoption by the Federal Council itself was announced for 2005, with adoption to be complete by all of the federal administration by the end of 2006, with a projected cost of CHF 25 million. \nThe logo consists of the Swiss coat of arms in convex triangular shield alongside the name \"Swiss Confederacy\" in the four national languages in black Frutiger Light typeset. Provision is made for using white script and adding a white line surrounding the coat of arms in cases where the logo is printed on red or black backgrounds.\n\nIn keeping with the new logo, a new law was passed in 2017, known as \"Wappenschutzgesetz\" (\"WSchG\", SR 232.21). This law replaces a 1931 law on the protection of federal, cantonal and foreign heraldic emblems.\nWhile the older law did not contain any specifications as to federal emblems, the new law specifies the \"Swiss coat of arms\" and the \"Swiss flag\", including two images in an annex, declared as authoritative in the text of the law, \nso that the federal \"Swiss coat of arms\" is now defined as a Swiss cross in a convex triangular shield.\nThe 2017 law thus also renders obsolete the 1815 definition of the federal coat of arms and its 1889 confirmation, SR 111 being marked as abrogated per 1 January 2017.\nThe image of the coat of arms shown in the document shows the hatching indicating heraldic tincture (red or \"gules\" indicated by vertical hatching) which has traditionally been used in black-and-white representations of the coat of arms throughout the 20th century. By contrast, the \"corporate design\" manual used by the federal administration specifies that no such hatching is to be shown in black-and-white representations of the \"logo\", the red shield instead being shown in solid black.\nIn spite of the more restrictive 2017 definition of the \"Swiss coat of arms\", other styles of heraldic shield remain in official use, specifically on coins and number plates.\n\nA number of regulations passed along with the new flag law, also in force from 2017, restricted the commercial use of the Swiss cross. Dubbed the \"Swissness regulation\" (\"Swissness-Verordnung\"), these changes were originally proposed in 2006\nby national councillor Jasmin Hutter and state councillor Anita Fetz, and eventually implemented in five separate regulations.\nNumerous exceptions were granted to companies who have historically used the Swiss cross, such as Swiss army knife producer Victorinox (uses the federal coat of arms as company logo since 1909).\n"}

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Rakovica.\n\nResnik is located in the southern section of the municipality and makes the southernmost point of the urban Belgrade City Proper. Originally a village distant from Belgrade, which developed between the valleys of the creek of Rakovički potok and the Topčiderka river. The creek of \"Pariguz\" flows through the southern parts of Resnik before it empties into the Topčiderka. The settlement is roughly triangularly shaped and bordered by the settlements of Sunčani Breg, Jelezovac, Straževica (north), Petlovo Brdo and Kijevo (north-west) which make Resnik's urban connection to the rest of Belgrade. The other three sides are still not urbanized (fields of Klik, Mandrine, Hladna Voda, Pašinac, etc.).\n\nKadinac creek flows into the Topčiderka west of the neighborhood. As it grows, Resnik almost makes a continuously built-up area with Rušanj on the south, and Pinosava on the south-east.\n\nThe village of Resnik was mentioned in Ottoman \"defter\" from 1528. It had 17 houses in 1713 and 33 in 1718. First school was open in 1842.\n\nResnik was a separate village and had its own municipality from 1832 until the 1959/1960 administrative reform, when became part of the Čukarica municipality. In 1972, it lost a separate settlement status and became part of the Belgrade urban proper. When municipality of Rakovica was reconstructed in 1974 from part of Čukarica, Resnik became part of it. It continued to be the seat of the local community, a sub-municipal administrative unit. By the 1981 census it was divided in two (Resnik and Avala Grad) and in 2010 two new local communities were created: Železnička Stanica Resnik and Sunčani Breg.\n\nWhen the neighboring Kijevo lost its separate settlement status in 1959, the majority of its area was attached to the village of Kneževac, but one small part became a cadastral part of Resnik.\n\nFrom the 1970s, local entrepreneurs attempted to turn Resnik into the nightlife attraction. In the 1970s, a club \"Resnik\" was opened in the former adult movie theater which was closed by the authorities. In the 1980s, a club \"Cvetni Breg\" was also opened. Though gaining some prominence, the move ultimately failed as the venues, being distant from downtown, weren't much attended.\n\nResnik is predominantly residential settlement. It is close to the important traffic routes: the valley of Rakovički potok is a route to the \"Kružni put\", suburban road of Belgrade and the future part of the projected Belgrade beltway, and a Belgrade-Požarevac railway, while the valley of Topčiderka is a route to the Belgrade-Niš railway. Resnik has a railway stations on both railways (northern one is officially styled Jajinci but it is far from that neighborhood). Tunnels are constructed on both road and railway passing through the northern section of Resnik.\n\nThe building industry develops along the \"Kružni put\" as a series of construction companies, cement plants and a building material's depots are located there. An open green market (\"kvantaš\") is also located on the road.\n\nThe artificial lake Pariguz is a well-known attraction in the area. It was made in 1989/90 and named after the nearby creek. It is a popular summer destination for many inhabitants of Resnik and for Belgraders who have weekend-houses in the area, even though the water was never tested and the banks are not arranged. Lake Pariguz was the proposed site of the 3rd European Peoples Global Action held in 2004, before it was moved to Jajinci.\n\nSouth-eastern extension of the neighborhood, in the direction of Pinosava. It is located on the Topčiderka river and is prone to flash floods during the heavy rains.\n\nFormerly the northernmost extension of Resnik, across the railway, in the Miljakovac direction. Split into the separate local community in 2010.\n\nResnik has its own railway station. Resnik railway station was located on the, now defunct, regional express network of BG Voz. On 13 April 2018, it became part of BG Voz, Belgrade's urban rail system, which connected Resnik with the Belgrade Centre railway station in Prokop. The projected commuting time, via Kijevo, Kneževac, Rakovica, Košutnjak and Topčider (the train will not stop at the last two stations), is calculated at only 18 minutes.\n\nNeighbourhood is served by five bus lines from GSP Belgrade; 47 (Slavija - Resnik) , 94 (New Belgrade - Resnik), 503 (Voždovac - Resnik), 504 (Vidikovac - Resnik) and 506 (Patin majdan - Resnik), also a line passing through the settlement is 507 (Kneževac - Rušanj)\n\nIn September 2007 an official motion was started by the municipality of Voždovac to create new sub-Avalan municipality (Avalski Venac), which would include the settlements of Ripanj, Beli Potok, Pinosava and Zuce from Voždovac, Vrčin from the municipality of Grocka and Resnik. It was supported by the local Voždovac administration headed by the Democratic Party at the time, but not by the members of the same party on the city level. It was also proposed by the political party G17 Plus in 2010 and Nova Stranka in 2015, but with Resnik remaining in Rakovica.\n"}

He is one of eight children, having two brothers and five sisters. When he was three, his family moved to the Dakota Territory near the town of Athol, located in what is now the state of South Dakota, where he would play semi-pro ball there for many years.\n\nPhillippe first appeared in pro baseball with the National League's Louisville Colonels in 1899. He had a 21–17 record that year, which was highlighted by a no-hitter in his seventh career game. While the Colonels disbanded after the season, before which owner Barney Dreyfuss moved a number of Louisville players, including Phillippe, to the Pirates, a team Dreyfuss co-owned.\n\nPhillippe won 20 games for four straight seasons as the Pirates won three straight National League pennants from 1901 to 1903. In 1900, he pitched for the Pirates in Game 3 of the \"Chronicle-Telegraph\" Cup series to determine the National League champion between the Pirates and the Brooklyn Superbas. Pittsburgh avoided the series sweep as Phillippe threw a six-hit shutout and the Pirates' bats added 10 runs. The Pirates lost the series 3 games to 1.\n\nIn 1903, Phillippe earned the honor of starting the first World Series game for the Pirates against the Boston Americans in 1903. In a complete game victory, Phillippe struck out 10 batters and earned the win against Cy Young to start the best-of-nine series. He single-handedly guided the Pirates to a 3–1 series lead, earning the wins in each game, but when his arm wore down due to overuse, the Americans came back to win the series 5 games to 3, with Phillippe losing the last two. His five decisions in the World Series are still a record for a pitcher. To show their appreciation, Pirates' fans presented him with a diamond horseshoe stickpin and team owner Barney Dreyfuss rewarded him ten shares of stock in the club.\n\nPhillippe missed half of the 1904 season due to a sore arm, before winning 20 games for the sixth time in 1905. However his years as an ace ended in 1908, when he suffered from another sore arm and missed nearly the entire season. Phillippe returned in 1909 to play a bit role on a Pirate team which went 110–42, en route to their first World Series title. In 1910, he was primarily used as a relief pitcher and had a 14–2 record. He retired after the 1911 season after making only three appearances that year.\n\nIn 1912, he managed the Pittsburgh Filipinos, which were named after him, and began play in the United States Baseball League. The Filipinos finished in first place during the league's inaugural season, which lasted only one month, with a 19-7 record. The team then moved to the new Federal League in 1913 and, for a short time, was later renamed the Pittsburgh Stogies.\n\nPhillippe was widely renowned for his control. No pitcher who has debuted since 1893 (when the pitching mound was moved to its present distance of 60 feet and 6 inches away from home plate) has averaged fewer walks per nine innings than Phillippe.\n\nDeacon is a distant relative of actor Ryan Phillippe, who named his first son Deacon in honor of the pitcher in 2003.\n\nThe spring that supplies the town with water to this day in Rural Retreat, Virginia is called Phillippe Springs.\n\nPhillippe was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1982.\n\n"}

As the angle approaches zero, it is clear that the gap between the approximation and the original function quickly vanishes.\nThe red section on the right, , is the difference between the lengths of the hypotenuse, , and the adjacent side, .

This leads to significant simplifications, though at a cost in accuracy and insight into the true behavior.\n\nThe 1 in 60 rule used in air navigation has its basis in the small-angle approximation, plus the fact that one radian is approximately 60 degrees.\n\nThe formulas for addition and subtraction involving a small angle may be used for interpolating between trigonometric table values:\n\nExample: sin(0.755)\n\n"}

It is currently entitled TRUMP® WHITE HOUSE, and is published by Americatastic, Inc.\n\nWHITEHOUSE.ORG was registered in 1995 by San Francisco residents Mark Pace & Brooks Talley, who first published satirical campaign spoofs on the site during the 1996 re-election campaign of Bill Clinton against Senator Bob Dole. Pace and Talley also registered dole96.org and clinton96.org.\n\nThe George W. Bush version of WHITEHOUSE.ORG was a long-running website parody of the 43rd U.S. President and his family, friends and administration. Launched by Chickenhead Productions in September 2001, the website's banner reads: \"THE WHITE HOUSE\" (and then in smaller print underneath) \"OFFICIOUS WEBSITE OF PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH\". Additionally, a spoof of the Seal of the President of the United States, with the bald eagle replaced with a vulture, appears on each webpage.\n\nIn spite of the site's authors' best efforts to make its satirical nature obvious, reader mail posted to the website indicated that some users nevertheless believed (or at least pretended to believe) WHITEHOUSE.ORG was the real White House website.\n\nThe George W. Bush version of WHITEHOUSE.ORG remains archived at whitehouse.georgewbush.org.\n\nThe website's purpose was to satirize the George W. Bush administration, their supporters and their politics using farce. The authors depicted the administration and their supporters as greedy, arrogant, overtly egotistical, culturally ignorant, nepotist, misogynist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic power-hungry warhawks who have absolutely no regard for any privacy or human rights other than their own. In keeping with those characterizations, women and ethnic and religious minorities who are in or favor the administration are ironically portrayed as unquestioning flock in (relatively) low-level job positions and who the white men of the administration dislike but keep around for support. For example, former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norm Mineta is listed as the \"Chauffeur\" and unfeatured anywhere but the list of members of the administration, while Justice Clarence Thomas of the U.S. Supreme Court is listed as the \"Best Boy\" and is satirically depicted in a reader Q&A session as incapable responding to any questions unrelated to pornography. U.S. Secy. of State Condoleezza Rice is an exception to the rule, but a poster once advertised on the site satirically depicted her exclaiming, \"I'm fighting for WHITEY!\"\n\n\nWHITEHOUSE.ORG gained attention in the media in 2003, when one page on the website was the center of a dispute between Vice President Dick Cheney's Counsel, David Addington, and John A. Wooden, the Editor in Chief of Chickenhead Productions. Addington made what was likely a litigation threat intended to scare the authors into censoring the website. Addington's effort, whatever the intent, backfired.\n\nIn December 2002, Addington sent a cease-and-desist letter to Wooden, arguing that certain characteristics of a satirical biography of Lynne Cheney (Dick Cheney's wife) on WHITEHOUSE.ORG were cause for litigation should Mrs. Cheney decide to file a lawsuit against Chickenhead Productions. Among the characteristics cited: photographs of her were used for a for-profit website without her permission; she was portrayed in the false biography \"in a false light\"; and that \"few people are likely to notice your disclaimer link\" and \"even fewer are likely to click on the link and actually see the disclaimer.\" Addington also cited the spoof of the Presidential seal was displayed on every page of the website, asserting such use of the seal was a violation of federal law. In conclusion, Addington demanded that Wooden delete the photographs and fictional text of the satirical page, and to fax him with notifications of the changes, but clarified that \"nothing in this request should be construed as expressing the lawfulness, wrongfulness or inappropriateness, or not, of any other aspect of your website\".\n\nWHITEHOUSE.ORG responded by doctoring photos of Lynne Cheney on the page with clown noses and the word \"CENSORED\", and by inserting a special disclaimer that read in part:\n\nWHITEHOUSE.ORG then satirized the incident in a fake \"Statement by the Vice President\" on February 20, 2003, titled \"Irate Vice President Cheney Issues a Punctilious, Legally Precise 'Oh, Wise Guy, Eh? Why I Oughta!' Letter to Nefarious 'Whitehouse.org' Terror Portal!\".\n\nWooden also gave a copy of the letter to the New York City chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, who then went to the press to speak out in defense of WHITEHOUSE.ORG's First Amendment rights. Wooden discussed the events in interviews with Salon.com and CNN. In the wake of the controversy, staffers in Vice President Cheney's office disavowed knowledge of Addington's letter, telling the Washington Post, \"We consider the matter closed.\"\n\nIn 2004, the Plume imprint of Penguin Group USA published the WHITEHOUSE.ORG spin-off book, llThe White House Inc. Employee Handbook: A Staffer's Guide to Success, Profit, and Eternal Salvation Inside George W. Bush's Executive Branchll. Written by John A. Wooden (Editor), Paul A. Bradley, John DeVore, and Chris Harper.\n\nIn 2005, the site's \"Reader Mail\" feature, which regularly published e-mails from the general public—many intended for George W. Bush—was adapted into an off-Broadway show: \"Dear Dubya: Patriotic Letters To WHITEHOUSE.ORG.\" Written & Curated by John A. Wooden, Directed by R.J.

He was born about 1578, and succeeded to the family estate in 1590 on the death of his father, who was assassinated on the orders of his kinsman, Robert Ker, younger of Cessford. Cessford's men ambushed William Kerr of Ancram on the stairs at the entry to his lodging and shot him with a pistol called a \"dag\".\n\nHe was cousin to Robert Carr, the favourite of James VI. Kerr appears to have also been honoured at an early age with court favour. Soon after the king's accession to the English throne, Kerr occupied a considerable station in the household of Prince Henry. He subsequently was employed by Prince Charles, who became his patron through life. Charles mediated the marriage between Sir Robert and the Lady Anne Stanley, daughter of the Earl of Derby.\n\nIn 1620, Kerr was involved in a fatal quarrel with Charles Maxwell, who insinuated that he had slighted the Duke of Buckingham and insulted him without provocation as he entered the palace at Newmarket. In a duel that followed, Sir Robert killed Maxwell. Even though Maxwell's friends acquitted Kerr of blame, the king's strict rules for prevention and punishment of duels forced him to flee to Holland, where he remained about a year. During his exile, he collected pictures, for which, like his royal master, he had good taste. He eventually presented those he brought back with him to the prince. He was also distinguished by his literary taste and was a friend of John Donne. He also lived in Whitehall Palace and Kew.\n\nOn the accession of Charles I to the throne, in 1625, Sir Robert Kerr was made a gentleman of the bedchamber.\n\nHe was Member of Parliament (MP) for Aylesbury in 1625, and for Lostwithiel and Preston in 1628.\n\nOn 24 June 1633, when Charles was in Scotland at his coronation, Kerr was elevated to the peerage under the titles Earl of Ancram and Lord Kerr of Nisbet, Langnewton, and Dolphinstoun. Previously, his son William, by his first wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Murray of Blackbarony, had married his relative, Anne, Countess of Lothian in her own right, and had been, by the king, given the title Earl of Lothian. It was therefore arranged, in the patent granted to Kerr, that his own title should descend to the children of his second marriage. Thus, he was father of two peers.\n\nUnlike others who owed everything to this prince, the Earl of Ancram remained the prince's steady adherent during the whole of his troubles—though he was unable to prevent his eldest son, the Earl of Lothian, from acting a conspicuous part on the opposite side. On the death of King Charles, Kerr took refuge in Holland, where he spent the remainder of his days in solitary afflictions and poverty, and died in 1654, aged 76. Jan Lievens painted him marvelously.\n\nHis son Charles, inherited his title, but ultimately merged with that of Lothian.\n\nHe had two sons by his first marriage to Elizabeth Murray:\n\nHe had one son and two daughters by his second marriage to Anne, daughter of William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby:\n"}

{"id": "2009229", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009229", "title": "Pugad Baboy", "text": "Pugad Baboy\n\nPugad Baboy (literally, \"swine's nest\" in Tagalog) is a comic strip created by Filipino cartoonist Apolonio \"Pol\" Medina, Jr. The strip is about a Manila community of mostly obese people – \"fat as pigs\", so to speak (\"baboy\" is Tagalog for pig).\n\nIt started appearing in the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\" on May 18, 1988, and was published exclusively in the Inquirer line of newspapers (Broadsheet \"Inquirer\" and its free concise sister tabloid called \"Inquirer Libre\" and tabloids \"Bandera\" and \"Tumbok\".) Its popularity has spawned numerous compilations, a live-action television series, and merchandise such as T-shirts and figurines.\n\nThe strip not only showcases domestic life; occasionally, it features adventure, drama, and pure spoof sequences. More often, the strip mirrors the general sentiment of the Filipino people on relevant topics such as corruption in the government as well as Filipino pop culture. In this respect, the strip has been likened to Garry Trudeau's \"Doonesbury\". Sometimes, political satire is woven into some ordinary strips and adventure stories.\n\nMedina conceived the strip while working under contract in Iraq in 1986. On May 18, 1988, he pitched his strips to the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\". His strip, named after a friend's piggery in Bulacan, was accepted on the spot.\n\nMedina originally spelled \"Pugad Baboy\" with a hyphen in the strip itself, though not in the title.\n\nFor many years, the strip was exclusively a black-and-white daily. A full-color Sunday strip in the same paper debuted on October 3, 2004. The full-colored strips ended their run sometime in 2009. Before the tabloid \"Inquirer Libre\" debuted, the strip appeared exclusively in the \"Inquirer\" broadsheet.\n\nIn a strip published in September 2006, Medina commented on online life substituting for physical contact. He mentioned Wikipedia as one of the alternatives to library visits, the other being Google.\n\nThe Inquirer decided to discontinue carrying \"Pugad Baboy\" in its comics section beginning June 5, 2013, after a strip for the June 4 edition reportedly lambasted hypocrisy among Christians against homosexuals when certain sectarian schools condone such students among their ranks. The newspaper later clarified that the cartoonist was not actually fired and the strip would just be suspended from publication until an internal investigation had been carried out. However, Medina officially resigned from the paper on June 7, 2013. Online news website Rappler later hired him, with the strip being published as a webcomic on the site starting June 17, 2013. The new version offers readers alternative punchlines with the respective voting options.\n\nIts final strip on Rappler, depicting a portal, appeared on March 1, 2018. The strip returned to print media with its first appearance in the \"Philippine Star\" and its sister publications, \"Pilipino Star Ngayon\" and \"Pang-Masa\", on March 5, 2018.\n\nThe Sungcal family reflects aspects of traditional and stereotypical families, with a housewife and an overseas contract worker as members, with a domestic helper to supplement. \"Sungkal\" is a Tagalog word for the term \"digging a hole with a (pig's) snout\".\n\n\nPolgas (derived from the Spanish and Tagalog \"pulgas\" for \"flea\") is the Sungcals' anthropomorphic family dog. Notable for his human characteristics such as speech, optional bipedalism, use of clothing and general behavior, he is called \"ang asong hindi\" (the dog who isn't) in material outside the strip proper because of his human characteristics. He acts as an extra member of the Sungcals and is his master Dagul's drinking buddy. However, he still behaves like a typical dog when he chooses to, though usually when he takes a bite out of people or leaks on them, most often Dagul.\n\nPolgas was initially a normal dog which walked on all fours, albeit one who wore shirts and undershirts like Dagul. Medina eventually gave him the ability to talk, followed by other human characteristics like a more humanlike physique. Originally, Brosia, a former ventriloquist, supplied Polgas's voice, but Medina was so dissatisfied with the idea that he abandoned it completely. Medina later explained in a 1995 spin-off graphic novel entitled \"Pirata\" that Polgas developed human characteristics due to his master's exotic version of \"bibingka\" (rice cake) and exposure to radiation emitted by television sets. Apparently, the combination had a teratogenic effect on him, somewhat similar to the mutation of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nMedina eventually developed the character into a \"man (dog) of action\", humorously saving the human characters from danger during story arcs, and later a full-fledged action hero involved with more serious activities. Polgas became a \"deep penetration\" agent of a fictional military division called the Organized Canine Bureau (OCB). This organization spoofs the TV series \"Wiseguy\", which features a fictional branch of the FBI called the Organized Crime Bureau, responsible for the protagonist Vinnie Terranova's activities.\n\nMedina's OCB was originally formed to combat the pilfering of stray dogs being sold in Metro Manila for their meat. Wisedog's second mission took place in Baguio City, where the selling and eating of dog meat is an illegal industry. (See The Baguio Connection). Polgas's original call sign in the OCB was \"Wisedog\" (a homage to \"Wiseguy\"). Later, he changed his call sign to \"Dobermaxx\" after he and some other residents of Pugad Baboy were accidentally sent to and returned from the year 2078. Subsequently, he is sometimes referred to as \"Agent Delta\" or simply \"Delta\".\n\nAs an agent, Polgas was issued with a prototype \"garapata\" (tick) \"gun\", which shoots droplets of tick sweat that causes itching that lasts for six months. Later, he was issued a tiny surveillance robot flea named \"Gary\" and ballistic \"arnis\" sticks. After his first mission, he was issued a customized Porsche 959, the \"Thunderdog\". As a result, from his adventure in 2078, he acquired a technologically advanced \"garapata gun\". Later he also acquired the \"Thunderpuppy\", a Harley Davidson V-Rod motorcycle.\n\nAs Wisedog/Dobermaxx, Polgas has fought many foes over the years, ranging from the mundane (drug pushers) to the fantastic (a lord of supernatural creatures). His most prominent foe is Atong Damuho (Renate Domingo), erstwhile drug pusher, dognapper, illegal logger and most recently, magic mushroom courier.\n\nHe appears in many other guises such as Dr. Sigmund Floyd (a spoof of Sigmund Freud), Pol Torero (World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE's The Undertaker), Amorsolo (a non-existent Ninja Turtle), Aquapol (Aquaman), Growlsbuster (spoofing The Ghostbusters), Darth Paul (spoofing Darth Maul), Polverine (a spoof of Wolverine, an X-Men character) and many others.\n\nThe Tangaras are two siblings from Gingoog City that both share a close relationship with the Sungcals, they are one of Pugad Baboy's few thin, slim residents. Their surname is a play on \"tanga\", a Tagalog word for \"stupid\".\n\n\nThe Sabaybunots reflect a very violent but tolerably quiet household. \"\"Sabay, bunot!\"\" is used by the Philippine military as an oral Tagalog command during martial ceremonies when the drawing of weapons is called for, as in the drawing of officers' swords. It roughly means \"draw simultaneously\". This may be in homage to Tomas' military background.\n\n\nIgno (Benigno Ramos; not to be confused with the Sakdalista movement founder of the same name) – Introduced to the series in 1998 as a bodyguard for Mao's son Jong, Igno is Tomas' cousin and an ex-convict from the actual National Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa. He claims he was incarcerated because of a Breach of Contract with his former boss, who employed him as a bodyguard. Possibly due to his being an ex-convict, he is actually more competent in survival skills than his cousin. He specializes in \"improvised weapons employment\", and even took a part-time job as a bounty hunter at one time in order to earn some cash. He drinks very often, but is afraid of ghosts and the supernatural. In fact, his frequent drinking caused his breath, blood and urine to become highly flammable, especially while drunk. Igno is also extremely tough and invulnerable, able to shrug off most things that, at worst, would have destroyed a normal person's body. His name is a play on \"ignoramus\". At the end of the Returnee, Igno starts his own high-tech greenhouse beside his kubo. During the epilogue chapters of the \"Dugo ng Shinobi\" Arc, 33 years later, an aged Igno is still seen to be in good health despite his history of maintaining a very dangerous and unhealthy lifestyle.\n\n\"Lamon\" is a Tagalog verb meaning \"to eat [food] in great quantities\", or more loosely, \"pig out\", and is commonly used as a label pertaining to one's gluttony. The surname \"was\" spelled \"Lamon\" at first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also recurring characters in the strip, including: \n\nOther minor characters in the strips serve as antagonists to the residents. \"See: Villains of Pugad Baboy\". On the other hand, the Pugad Baboy gang are often aided by friends and acquaintances they meet during these escapades. See each article of the story arcs for info on these allies.\n\nProminent personalities, both local and foreign, have also made cameo appearances in \"Pugad Baboy\". Among them are presidents Ramos, Estrada, and Arroyo, martial artist Ernesto Presas, politicians Robert Jaworski, Rene Saguisag and Richard Gordon, singer Freddie Aguilar, comedian Leo Martinez, boxer Manny Pacquiao, Pope John Paul II, Mel Gibson, and Michael Jackson.\n\nMedina drew many of the above minor characters for the covers of some compilations, but these did not appear in the selected strips. Some of these appeared either earlier in the comic strip's run (such as Father Marty) while others were just mere extras (such as the Los Kosas Muntinlupas, Igno's former fellow inmates in Bilibid Prison). Many of these were only given official names in \"character guide\" supplements in compilations (such as the inmates and the school principal, mostly hitherto unnamed). These names are then carried over to future strips.\n\nBritish English words are prevalent in the strip (like \"-ise\" words) and Medina uses these kinds of words in his own write-ups.\n\nThe characters are typically ageless, and their actual ages are usually vague. The few characters whose present ages are stated are Dagul (48), and the kids (8 or 9). Utoy and 'Adre are the only characters to have visibly aged in the strip through the years, barring flashbacks (Utoy first appeared as a baby; 'Adre has lately lost some of his hair). A \"holdover hippie\" from the 1960s, Bab nevertheless seems to be only in his twenties or thirties, which would be impossible in real life. In the early-1990s story arc \"Ang Hiwaga ng Dueñas\" (published in \"Pugad Baboy 4\") the faith healer Mang Danilo, an old acquaintance, mentions that Bab was teenaged at the time of Woodstock (Bab immediately covers the faith healer's mouth as the word \"Woodstock\" is mentioned). A series of strips published in \"Pugad Baboy X\" (1998) implies that Bab is at least over 28 years old. In the same compilation, Tita Cel mentions that Jolen is 27 years younger than Bab and since the stock age of the Pugad Baboy children is 8–9, Bab is possibly 35–36. The first volume of the Polgas Comics collections has a story called \"Class Reunion\" illustrated by Jerald Dorado which has Bab attending an elementary class reunion for the 'Batch of 1969' which further enforces this view of his age.\n\nOne of the strip's running gags is the depiction (or at least the description) of Arabs having very foul body odor. Examples of this running gag are Kules' Saudi friend, which the former calls \"Lancaster\" (because the friend smells like the \"langka\" or jack fruit), and the stinky concentrated chemical agent PSSI (\"pawis ng singit ng sundalong Iraqi\" or Iraqi soldier's jock sweat) mentioned in the story arc \"The Baguio Connection\". This running gag is likely based on the author's personal experience. It is also reasonable, considering that the desert atmosphere in most Arab countries prevents their people from taking daily baths.\nOther such gags include the monotonous diet of chicken in Saudi Arabia (also likely based on personal experience), Paltik's blatant aversion to the \"coming of age\" ritual of circumcision, and Polgas and Dagul de-appetizing Debbie on the breakfast table. And steriotyped Iraqis are seen in earlier works.\n\nMedina usually voices out his takes on events, people and the like through Polgas and Mang Dagul. (Polgas is also recurringly shown as a comic strip artist, like his creator.) According to Medina, the characters he most identifies with are Polgas, Mang Dagul, and Utoy; like him, they wear earrings on their left ears. Medina himself has even appeared once in the strip proper, holding a cartooning workshop in Palawan, though he avoids breaking the fourth wall by not referring to himself as the strip's creator.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this article, the strip does not showcase domestic life alone as Medina has created story arcs which involve the various characters in adventurous, dramatic or other plotted situations.\n\nThere is no standard as how long a story arc may last, since it can run from several weeks to a few months. The story arc is only titled when it is included in a compilation.\n\nThis list below contains named story arcs that last at least 15 strips long and which compilation each appears.\n\n\nNot included in the list above is \"Planet of the Dogs\", Medina's homage/parody to \"Planet of the Apes\". This story arc (which appeared in \"Disi-Sais!\") is relatively short at only nine strips long. Since that arc, it took Medina three years before he came up with \"Benigno Ramos: Bounty Hunter\", and then another three with \"Bodyguard\".\n\nThe first compilation of \"Pugad Baboy\" comic strips was originally part of a thesis by Frank Aldana, a student of De La Salle University. This compilation became so popular that Medina himself made more. Typically, a new compilation is released near the start of each year. Including Aldana's compilation, there are currently 34 \"Pugad Baboy\" compilation books:\n\n\nMedina also made other \"Pugad Baboy\" original works:\n\nThe popularity of \"Pugad Baboy\" also spawned some merchandise such as DogStyle Apparel and Polgas P-gurines (a set of figurines depicting Polgas and some Polgas characters). They are currently distributed by Medina's company, Pol Medina Jr. Novelties.\n\nOn September 25, 1993, \"Pugad Baboy\" was made into a live-action TV show called \"Rated PB (Pang-Bayan) – Pugad Baboy Sa TV\". Directed by Leo Martinez, the show featured Edgar Mortiz (Bab), Giselle Sanchez (Brosia) and Rudy Meyer (Mang Dagul) among the cast. Though the show was live-action, the opening logo featured limited animation. Some of the episodes were based upon earlier plots in the strip, while others followed a skit show format. It was aired on GMA 7 and lasted only two seasons, 15 episodes in all.\n\nIn the ninth book, Medina states that he dreams of making a \"Pugad Baboy\" cartoon.\n\nBesides \"Pugad Baboy\" books, Medina has also published compilations of his editorial cartoons for the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\", called the \"Ink and Politics\" series. The cartoons sometimes feature \"Pugad Baboy\" characters. Polgas always appears on covers of these books. Three books have been published as the newspaper stopped hiring him as substitute political cartoonist in around 2006.\n\nMedina includes photos and caricatures of himself in some of the strip's compilations.\n\nSome \"Pugad Baboy\" characters can be seen on the ads of Dencio's, a notable restaurant chain in the Philippines. They are also featured as endorsers of Quake Overload Cakes, a line of pastries made by snack company Jack 'N Jill. Animation has been done by another great Pinoy artist, Arnold Arre\n\n"}

The band was formed of former members of Uriel, the other member of which was guitarist Steve Hillage. After Hillage left Uriel in August 1968, the other three continued as a trio. Having signed a deal with the Middle Earth club's management branch, they were advised to change their name to Egg, allegedly because Uriel \"sounded too much like 'urinal'\". In mid-1969 the band signed a deal with Decca's 'progressive' music subsidiary Deram and released their debut album in March 1970. While not a commercial success, it was received well enough for the label to finance the recording of a follow-up, but when the time came to release it, the label shelved it until producer Neil Slaven's lobbying finally resulted in \"The Polite Force\" coming out in February 1971. Now signed to The Groundhogs' management company, Egg finished the year with an increased touring schedule, but in spite of accumulating enough material for a third album, they were unable to secure another record deal, and split up in July 1972.\n\nIn 1974 Stewart, who had signed with Virgin as a member of Hatfield and the North, got a deal for Egg to record their unreleased material, which resulted in the farewell album \"The Civil Surface\".\n\nIn December 2007, a selection of live recordings from between 1969 and 1972, entitled \"The Metronomical Society\", was released.\n\nEgg are often regarded as part of the Canterbury scene, a loose movement of progressive and psychedelic musicians, based on Stewart's later membership of Hatfield and the North and National Health, although the band have no geographical connection to Canterbury. Their music can be described as progressive rock with elements of psychedelia and chamber rock (later exemplified by the Rock In Opposition movement). They employed unusual time signatures, as reflected in songs like \"Seven Is A Jolly Good Time\". They also brought a humorous element to their music. Mont Campbell, the band's main composer, acknowledged the strong influence of Igor Stravinsky, which resulted in multi-part suites such as the imaginatively-titled \"Symphony n°2\" and \"Long Piece n°3\".\n\nIn mid-1969, to capitalise on the psychedelic rock market, Stewart, Campbell and Brooks contributed to the one-off studio project Arzachel, named after a moon crater. Also featured in that project was Steve Hillage (on summer holiday from university), who had like the others been a member of the pre-Egg band Uriel. Egg were by that time under contract to Decca, therefore all were credited under pseudonyms.\n\nAlso available is a 26,000-word, 60-page companion booklet \"Copious Notes\". Written by Dave Stewart, Mont Campbell and their close friend Antony Vinall, it tells the inside story of Uriel, Egg, Arzachel and the Ottawa Company, from the formation of Uriel in early 1968 to the making of Egg's final album \"The Civil Surface\" in 1974. The text includes personal memoirs, anecdotes, short stories, random recollections, social observation, period details, musical analysis and song lyrics, as well as a priceless collection of archive photos taken by Terry Yetton and the musicians.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2009231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009231", "title": "Martinus Rørbye", "text": "Martinus Rørbye\n\nMartinus Christian Wesseltoft Rørbye (17 May 1803 – 29 August 1848) was a Danish painter, known both for genre works and landscapes. He was a central figure of the Golden Age of Danish painting during the first half of the 19th century.\n\nThe most traveled of the Danish Golden Age painters, he traveled both north to Norway and Sweden and south to Italy, Greece and Constantinople. He was also the first Danish painter to take to painting in Skagen at the northern top of Jutland, almost half a century before the thriving community of Skagen Painters formed and came to fame, through Michael Ancher, Anna Ancher and P.S. Krøyer.\n\nMartinus Rørbye was born in Drammen in Norway on 17 May 1803 to Danish parents Ferdinand Henrik Rørbye and his wife Frederikke Eleonore Catherine de Stockfleth. \nMartinus was not inclined to schooling, but in 1820 started his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at 17 years of age. He studied under Christian August Lorentzen and Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, a strong influence on a generation of artists during the Danish Golden Age. Rørbye was a favorite student of Eckersberg, and they formed a close association. He took to Eckersberg's careful attention to nature and his strivings to capture details realistically. He was also greatly influenced by Lorentzen's use of color.\n\nHe won the Academy's small silver medal in 1824, and the large silver medal in 1828. He competed for the gold medal and won a cash prize. In 1829 he won the small gold medal for his painting \"Christ healing the blind\", which remains in the ownership of the Royal Danish Academy. He never won the large gold medal in spite of repeated attempts.\n\n\"View from the Artist's Window\", is a painting by a young Rørbye around 1825, heralding the many travels he would later make with its depiction of a caged bird in an open window, on the border between the safety of his parents' home and the wide, unknown world represented by a berthed ship.\n\nRørbye first exhibited his paintings at Charlottenborg in 1824 and would do so almost every year until 1848. His works were modestly priced, and he found sufficient buyers for his pieces. The majority of his works in the 1820s consisted of views from Copenhagen and the island of Zealand, although he also painted a number of portraits including one of Lorentzen, his painting instructor.\n\nTwice, in 1830 and 1832, he traveled to Norway. On the first of these journeys he visited Jutland on the way, a rare destination for painters at that time. On 31 May 1830 he went to Århus on the paddle steamer \"Dania\". Another passenger on the ship was Hans Christian Andersen and the two artists decided to travel together for a while. From Århus they went north, staying at the Rosenholm, Clausholm and Tjele estates. After that, Rørbye and Andersen parted with Rørbye, continuing to the remote and seldom-visited Thy province of north-western Jutland to visit relatives in Thisted. From his journals it can be concluded that he found the place deeply exotic, making detailed sketches and notes of everything from women's costumes and markets to the scenery. However, he found the landscape unsuitable for painting due to the lack of trees. On 7 July he left Thisted bound for Norway.\n\nIn Norway he painted landscapes under the influence of Johan Christian Dahl and Caspar David Friedrich.\n\nIn 1834 Rørbye received a travel scholarship from the Academy on account of his talents as a portraitist. He traveled by way of the Netherlands and France to Rome, In Paris he met Peter Andreas Heiberg, August Bournonville and the French painter Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres.\n\nWhen he arrived in Rome, he joined the city's thriving Danish artists community which had Bertel Thorvaldsen as its central figure.\n\"A Group of Danish Artists in Rome\", is a painting depicting the artist in Rome, painted by Constantin Hansen. Rørbye is number two from the left sitting behind Bindesbøll who is lying on the floor with a fez he often wore after their visit to Constantinople. Also appearing in the picture are the painter himself, Marstrand, Küchler, Blunck and Jørgen Sonne, sitting on the table.\n\nIn Italy he traveled to Sorrento, the Sabine Mountains, and Sicily.\nThe following year Rørbye traveled to Athens accompanied by the architect Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll, one of the compatriots he had met in Rome. From there they continued to Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire, a rare adventure in those days. He sketched prodigiously during his travels.\n\nIn 1837 he returned home to Copenhagen. His excellent orientalist studies from these exotic locales brought him the Danish public's attention. The Academy, recognizing the excellence of his work during his travels, invited him to apply for membership by submitting a painting. His task was to create a Turkish folk scene. His motif came from a study of a \"Caravan near Smyrna\". It was finished in 1838 and he was unanimously voted into the Academy. His studies from Greece and Turkey continued to serve as the basis for his creative output. In this regard he admired the work of French painter Horace Vernet.\n\nThat same year at the Spring Exhibition he received the Exhibition Medal, the first time it had been given out, for a painting of a scene outside the Kılıç Ali Pasha Complex, \"A Turkish notary witnesses a marriage contract\". Typical of Rørbye are the rich colours and careful attention to detail.\n\nHe married Rose Frederikke Schiøtt on 29 August 1839. His health was not good, however, and that same autumn he traveled again to Italy in the hope of renewing his strength. He painted \"\"Torvet i Amalfi\"\" (\"The plaza in Amalfi\") during this stay, and it was exhibited in 1842. He returned home in 1841.\n\nHe gave private painting lessons to Christen Dalsgaard, and in 1844 became professor at the Academy's school of modelling. His health deteriorated, and he died on 29 August 1848 in Copenhagen, leaving his young wife widowed and with several small children. She exhibited twelve of his paintings, mostly of Italian subjects, in 1849.\n\nHe is remembered for his genre paintings, his landscapes and his architectural paintings, as well as for the many sketches he made during his numerous travels. He painted numerous scenes of life in Copenhagen, as well as large compositions showing Italian and Turkish landscapes and scenes of folk life. He painted few portraits.\n\nHe was one of the most traveled of the Golden Age painters, and distinguished his artistic production by his interpretations of lands rarely explored at that time for their artistic motifs, as well as for his anecdotal genre paintings depicting the Copenhagen of his day.\n\nRørbye visited Skagen on three occasions, painting the local fishermen and the North Sea environs. The first time was in 1833, the year before he set out on his travels to the Mediterranean area and almost half a century before the community of Skagen Painters formed in the town and came to fame. He returned to Skagen towards the end of his life, in the summers of 1847 and 1848. His painting of \"Men of Skagen on a summer evening in fair weather\" was one of the last he completed.\nHis works appear in a number of Danish art museums, including the Danish National Gallery (\"Statens Museum for Kunst\"), the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, and the Hirschsprung Collection.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2009236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009236", "title": "Joseph Kinsey Howard", "text": "Joseph Kinsey Howard\n\nJoseph Kinsey Howard (February 28, 1906 – August 25, 1951) was an American journalist, historian, and author, who wrote extensively about the history, culture, and economic circumstances of Montana. One of the state's most noted authors of nonfiction, Howard's landmark 1943 book, \"Montana: High, Wide, and Handsome\" is a respected account of Montana history that has influenced later generations of historians. Howard also authored numerous other historic and literary works, and was a vocal, articulate and persuasive advocate for a variety of social, economic and environmental reforms. These endeavors earned Howard the posthumous sobriquet, \"Montana's Conscience.\" Howard believed Montana and the rural West provided the \"last stand against urban technological tedium\" for the individual. He fervently believed that small towns of the sort that predominated in Montana provided a democratic bulwark for society. Howard's writings demonstrate his strong belief in the necessity to identify and preserve a region's cultural heritage. Howard worked first as a newspaper editor on the \"Great Falls Leader,\" later for the Montana Study (a statewide community development project), and as a freelance writer. His books, speeches and magazine articles, expressed his ideals of community awareness and identity, encouraging readers to retain an idealistic vision contesting the deadening demands of the modern world.\n\nHoward was born in Oskaloosa, Iowa, and spent his early childhood years in Lethbridge, Alberta, with his family. In 1919 he moved with his mother to Great Falls, Montana, where he graduated from high school in 1923. Immediately after graduating, Howard landed a job as a reporter for the \"Great Falls Leader,\" one of the city's two daily newspapers at the time. He was promoted to news editor at the Leader in 1926, at age 20, a position he held until 1944.\n\nAt the \"Leader,\" Howard developed a characteristic writing style that was simultaneously straightforward, evocative, and compelling, and within a few years his talent began to receive broader attention. Beginning in the mid-1930s Howard authored numerous nonfiction articles for national publications, including The Nation, Harper's Magazine and others. He was also a stringer covering Montana issues for Time and Life magazines. Many of the essays Howard produced for these periodicals explored the difficulties faced by Montana's Native Americans and other disenfranchised groups; others were exposés of what Howard saw as undue corporate influence in Montana economics and life, particularly by the Anaconda Copper Mining Company.\n\nThough primarily an author of nonfiction, Howard also wrote book reviews for \"The New York Times\" and short stories that were published in \"The Saturday Evening Post\", \"Esquire\", and elsewhere.\n\nHoward's first book-length effort was \"Montana: High, Wide, and Handsome,\" which was published in 1943. The volume was both a thoughtful history of the state, and an impassioned indictment of the corporate and bureaucratic forces that had heavily influenced much of that history. Among the book's primary targets were Anaconda Copper, which controlled much of the state's economic and political activity at the time, and the Great Northern Railway, which had lured thousands of homesteaders onto Montana land that proved wholly unsuitable for farming. The book also paid particular attention to the inappropriate and inequitable usage of the state's scarce water resources, making an open plea for reform of the system.\n\n\"Montana: High, Wide, and Handsome\" proved to be an unquestioned landmark in the state's literary history, drawing significant attention both to Howard and the causes he espoused. The themes of corporate exploitation that Howard so convincingly and eloquently outlined became the primary focus of Montana historians for a generation to come, and became a primary theme in the works of K. Ross Toole, the state's most noted academic historian. Howard's book remains perhaps the most influential and evocative work ever published about Montana's past.\n\nThe recognition afforded Howard by the response to \"Montana: High, Wide, and Handsome\" helped open the doors to additional writing, research, and advocacy projects. In 1944 Howard resigned his position at the \"Leader\" to become a staff member of the Montana Study, a research project largely funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. The Study was an examination of life in small-town Montana, with the goal of identifying ways to improve the quality of life in such places and thus helping ensure their preservation. Howard remained with the Study for two years, before resigning in order to return to writing full-time.\n\nHoward's second published volume was \"Montana Margins: A State Anthology,\" completed in 1946. The book is a thick collection of short fiction, poetry, and historic narratives, covering the full spectrum of Montana's geography and history. The depth and scope of the book made it a model for later regional anthologies, such as the voluminous 1988 imitation, \"The Last Best Place: A Montana Anthology.\"\n\nThe remainder of Howard's life was devoted to writing, promoting the arts in Montana, and teaching writers workshops. Aided by the support of Guggenheim Fellowships in 1947 and 1948, he devoted considerable effort to the writing of a history of Métis leader Louis Riel and his resistance movements against the Canadian government. The result of this project was the book \"Strange Empire: A Narrative of the Northwest,\" published posthumously in 1952.\n\nHoward died on August 25, 1951 after suffering a heart attack at age 45. He is still recognized, however, as one of Montana's most talented, influential, and significant authors. His legacy was summed up by Bernard DeVoto in 1952, who wrote, \"By the time Howard died, he came closer to being the spokesman of the West than any other writer has ever been.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2009237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009237", "title": "Tour of Duty (TV series)", "text": "Tour of Duty (TV series)\n\nTour of Duty is an American military drama television series based on events in the Vietnam War, broadcast on CBS. The series ran for three seasons, from September 24, 1987, to April 28, 1990, for a total of 58 one-hour episodes. The show was created by Steve Duncan and L. Travis Clark and produced by Zev Braun.\n\nThe show follows an American infantry platoon on a tour of duty during the Vietnam War. It was the first television series to regularly show Americans in combat in South Vietnam and was one of several similarly themed series to be produced in the wake of the acclaimed Oliver Stone film \"Platoon\" (1986).\n\nThe series won an Emmy Award in 1988 for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Series, and it was nominated again in 1989 and 1990.\n\n\"Tour of Duty\" examined the issues of politics, faith, teamwork, racism, suicide, fragging, terrorism, civilian deaths, sexuality, drug abuse, and how the lives of soldiers and civilians were permanently affected by the Vietnam War.\n\nThe first season began in 1967 and followed Bravo company's second platoon, a standard light infantry platoon conducting \"search and destroy\" missions in Vietnam, under the command of 2nd Lieutenant (1st Lieutenant from the start of season 2) Myron Goldman (Stephen Caffrey) and Staff Sergeant (later Sergeant First Class) Zeke Anderson (Terence Knox). It was filmed on location in Hawaii at Schofield Barracks.\n\nFor the second and third seasons, the series was filmed around Los Angeles, California, to reduce the budget. The same locations, notably a small river with grass on one bank and woods on the other, were reused in a number of episodes. The old set of war comedy-drama television series \"M*A*S*H\" was also used for filming.\n\nThe change of location also led to a change in the show's direction. Beginning in the second season, the platoon was relocated to a base near Saigon. Production staff interviewed in \"Vietnam Magazine\" said this change in premise doomed the series because it shifted from being a realistic chronicle about the life of an average combat infantryman to an action/romantic/drama show. CBS wanted female characters because ABC had premiered \"China Beach\", a Vietnam Army Nurses drama, which was aimed directly at attracting more female viewers.\n\nIn \"Tour of Duty\"'s third season, the remaining female character was killed off, and the platoon was transferred to a SOG unit under the command of Colonel Brewster (played by Carl Weathers). The unit conducted covert operations in Vietnam and Cambodia which included a fictional version of the raid on Son Tay Prison. The show was canceled at the end of this season due to falling ratings.\n\nGuest stars included Lee Majors, James Hong, Mako, Kelly Hu, Angela Bassett, Ving Rhames, Melora Hardin, Everett McGill, Olivia d'Abo, David Alan Grier, Richard Brooks, and Michael Madsen.\n\nThe series won an Emmy Award in 1988 for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Series (for \"Under Siege\"), and it was nominated again in 1989 and 1990.\n\nEmmy Award nominations:\n\nEddie Award nominations\n\nIn Argentina, it was broadcast by Telefe as \"Nam: Primer Pelotón\" (Nam: First Platoon).\n\nIn Australia, Network Ten originally aired the series at 7:30 pm. In recent years, repeats have returned to Australian television with the Seven Network repeating the series in 2006 in late Thursday night/Early Friday morning timeslots airing at 11.30 pm then later bumped to 12:00 am midnight. Repeats also returned with Channel Ten repeating the series in 2010 in late Sunday nights/Early Monday mornings airing at 1:30am. FOX Classics started airing the first series on the 17 September 2012.\n\nIn Brazil, the show was broadcast by SBT with the title \"Combate no Vietnã\" (Combat in Vietnam).\n\nIn Chile, Paraguay and Colombia, the show was aired with the title \"Misión del Deber\" (Mission of Duty), based on the Mexican dub of the series.\n\nIn Dominican Republic, the show was aired with the title \"Misión del Deber\" in channel 11.\n\nIn Costa Rica, it was aired by channel 9 and then by channel 7 as \"Misión Vietnam\" (Mission Vietnam).\n\nIn Denmark, the show was broadcast in the 1990s as \"Platoon B\" on various local-TV networks, mainly on Kanal 2.\n\nIn France and the Canadian province of Québec, the French-speaking version was called \"L'Enfer du devoir\" (The Hell of duty) and aired on La Cinq in France, and on the Historia channel in Québec Monday through Thursday at 5 PM in July and August 2005.\n\nIn Germany, the show was aired by RTL with the title \"NAM – Dienst in Vietnam\" (NAM – Service in Vietnam).\n\nIn Israel, the show aired in the mid-2000s on the now-defunct local version of the AXN cable channel under the name \"Sherut Kravi\" (Combat Service). It was also previously broadcast on the METV channel.\n\nIn Italy, the show was aired by a local TV Network Italia7 with the title \"Vietnam Addio\" (Goodbye Vietnam) in the form of a TV-movie. It was also aired on the national network Italia1.\n\nIn Japan, the show with the title \"Good Luck Saigon\" was aired through the Wowow, a paid satellite broadcast around 1991. For this reason, the show is least known by the Japanese public.\n\nIn Malaysia, it was aired by Sistem Televisyen Malaysia Berhad's channel TV3 as \"NAM: Tour of Duty\".\n\nIn Mexico, it was aired by Televisa's Canal 5 as \"Misión del Deber\" (Mission of Duty).\n\nIn the Netherlands, it was broadcast by Veronica on the national television network.\n\nIn New Zealand, the show was aired by TVNZ. It was a very popular show in New Zealand and re-runs were also shown on the Orange TV network throughout the 1990s.\n\nIn Nigeria, the show was aired by the national broadcaster, NTA in the early 1990s.\n\nIn Norway, the show was broadcast with the title \"Pliktløpet\" (Run of duty) by TV Norge in the 1990s.\n\nIn Sweden, the show was broadcast with the title \"Pluton B i Vietnam\" (Pluton B in Vietnam) by TV 5 Nordic in the 1990s.\n\nIn the Philippines, it was weekly aired in English on GMA 7 every Monday night at 9:00 pm. The American service members stationed in the Philippines routinely watched it on the local network because the episodes were newer than the ones on Armed Forces Radio and Television Service's Far East Network.\n\nIn Poland, the show was never aired, but there was a VHS release with the title \"Rok w Piekle\" (Year in Hell).\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, it was (as of July 2013) being shown with the original title and in English with Arabic subtitles. It is broadcast on the MBC Action channel.\n\nIn South Africa, the show was aired with the title \"Sending Vietnam\" (Mission Vietnam) in Afrikaans by the SABC.\n\nIn South Korea, the show was aired with the title \"머나먼 정글\" (Faraway Jungle) by MBC from 1990. It was initially aired at 11:00 PM Monday but due to popularity it moved to 6:00 PM Saturday.\n\nIn Spain, the show aired as \"Camino del Infierno\" (Road to Hell) on Telecinco in late night hours Wednesday and later on C+ as \"Tour of Duty\" at 12.00 M.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the show has been aired at least twice, once in 1990s and once in 2007/8 by MTV.\n\nIn Sweden, the show was originally scheduled by the public service SVT network as \"Pluton B i Vietnam\" (Platoon B in Vietnam), but only the pilot episode was broadcast followed by a massive media outcry for the heavy violence in the show. In the late 1990s, the show was picked up by Kanal 5 under the same name.\n\nIn Taiwan (Republic of China), the show has been aired on China Television Company, Ltd. (CTV) as 霹靂神兵. The Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China) also purchased the series, renamed 天降神兵 and aired it on Chinese Television System (CTS) and CTS Education and Culture.\n\nIn the United Arab Emirates, it was aired on Dubai Channel 33.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Tour of Duty\" was screened on ITV on Friday nights at various times, usually around midnight. It was later broadcast on the FX channel.\n\nIn Venezuela, it was broadcast by RCTV as \"Pelotón del deber\" (Platoon of Duty).\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the show was broadcast in the early 1990s, showing on the national television channel ZBC TV1 (Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation Television 1) at nine o'clock pm on Thursdays and developed a cult following, becoming a hit television series throughout its screening.\n\nThe opening theme song was an abbreviated version of The Rolling Stones hit \"Paint It, Black\" that had featured in the end titles of the 1987 Vietnam War film \"Full Metal Jacket\"; this was removed for the US DVD release. The closing consisted of an instrumental, synthesized tune with a distinctive Asian sound mixed in with acoustic guitar; it was performed by Joseph Conlan, and was never released for public consumption other than in the series. That music was used as background music for most of the series. On the US release DVD most of the Vietnam War era popular music was replaced by instrumental bits to cover the blank spots of music.\n\nAll three seasons that have been released in the United Kingdom feature the complete original soundtrack, including \"Paint It, Black\".\n\nThe show was known for its classic American rock soundtrack including Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jimi Hendrix, and Jefferson Airplane. One first-season episode, \"USO Down\", used \"live\" versions of \"Wooly Bully\", and \"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\" as performed by a USO band, the latter song being used also for ironic comment. The songs in this episode were retained in the DVD soundtracks. But for copyright reasons, the VHS and DVD soundtracks of the majority of episodes were replaced with soundalikes (the music played, but there were no voices)—a move which was widely protested by buyers, and resulted in a significantly lower sales volume for the third-season DVD set than for the first two.\n\nIn the Netherlands, amongst other European nations, a total number of seven albums were released, containing most of the songs featured on the show. As a result, \"Paint It, Black\" was re-released as a single, again hitting the number 1 position in the Dutch top 40 popchart in May 1990.\n\nThe \"Tour of Duty\" television series soundtrack was released by CBS on Columbia Records as four different compilation albums during 1988 and 1989. The original albums are now out of print. Their track listings are as follows:\nIn 1992, Sony Music released a compilation CD titled \"The Best of 'Tour of Duty\"'. It contains only twenty of the songs featured in the four original \"Tour of Duty\" Soundtrack albums.\n\nSony Pictures released all 3 seasons in the USA for the very first time in 2004-2005. All original music was replaced with sound-alike versions. These releases have been discontinued and are out of print.\n\nOn August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library including \"Tour of Duty\". They subsequently re-released the first season on DVD on September 16, 2014.\n\nOn April 21, 2015, Mill Creek released a budget priced complete series set, an eleven-disc set featuring all 58 episodes of the series.\n\nOn November 7, 2011 Fabulous Films (licensed from Fremantle Home Entertainment) in the United Kingdom released the complete first season as a region 2 PAL boxed set. This release has improved sound and picture quality and the complete original soundtrack, including \"Paint It, Black\". The release consists of 5 DVDs covering all 21 episodes. The fifth disc contains extras including hundreds of behind the scenes stills and images and a brand new documentary that runs for 55 minutes. Fabulous Films filmed a series of interviews in Los Angeles in July 2011 with seven of the key cast: Terence Knox, Joshua D. Maurer, Steve Akahoshi, Tony Becker, Eric Bruskotter, Kevin Conroy and Miguel A. Núñez Jr. and key members of the production crew that included Zev Braun (producer) Bill L. Norton (writer/director), Steve Smith (writer/producer), Steve Duncan (creator) and Paul Sinor (military advisor). Additional documentaries are being produced for the season 2 and 3 releases.\n\nThe complete second season was released on May 14, 2012 in the UK. Featuring a brand new making of documentary 'The Story of Tour Of Duty' Part 2 (30 mins) featuring Cast and Crew, Character Biographies, Original Cast Biographies, Original Crew Biographies, Action Stills, Behind The Scenes Stills, Publicity Stills, Synopses and Glossary of \"Tour of Duty\" Military Terms.\n\nOn November 26, 2012, Fabulous released the complete third season on DVD in the UK, along with the complete series set which was released simultaneously. The third installment of the documentary features Dan Gauthier (1st Lieutenant Johnny McKay).\n\n"}

{"id": "2009253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009253", "title": "English passive voice", "text": "English passive voice\n\nThe passive voice is a grammatical \"voice\". The noun or noun phrase that would be the object of a corresponding active sentence (such as \"Our troops defeated \"the enemy\"\") appears as the subject of a sentence or clause in the passive voice (\"\"The enemy\" was defeated by our troops\").\n\nThe subject of a sentence or clause featuring the passive voice typically denotes the recipient of the action (the patient) rather than the performer (the agent). Verbs in the passive voice in English are formed using several parts (periphrastically): the usual construction uses the auxiliary verbs \"to be\" or \"to get\" together with the past participle of the main verb.\n\nFor example, \"Caesar was stabbed by Brutus\" is in the passive voice. The subject, \"Caesar\", indicates the person acted upon. The agent is expressed here with the phrase \"by Brutus\", but this can be omitted. The equivalent sentence in the active voice is \"Brutus stabbed Caesar\", in which the subject denotes the doer, or agent, Brutus. A sentence featuring the passive voice is sometimes called a \"passive sentence\", and a verb phrase in passive voice is sometimes called a \"passive verb\".\n\nEnglish allows a number of passive constructions which are not possible in many of the other languages with similar passive formation. These include promotion of an indirect object to subject (as in \"Tom was given a bag\") and promotion of the complement of a preposition (as in \"Sue was operated on\", leaving a stranded preposition).\n\nUse of the passive in English varies with writing style and field. It is generally much less used than the active voice but is more prevalent in scientific writing than in other prose. Contemporary style guides discourage excessive use of the passive but appropriate use is generally accepted, for instance where the patient is the topic, the agent is unimportant (and therefore omitted), or the agent is to be highlighted (and therefore placed toward the end).\n\nThe passive voice is a specific grammatical construction. The essential components, in English, are a form of the auxiliary verb \"be\" (or sometimes \"get\") and the past participle of the main verb denoting the action. The agent (the doer of the action) may be specified using a prepositional phrase with the preposition \"by,\" but this is optional.\nIt can be used in a number of different grammatical contexts; for instance, in declarative, interrogative, and imperative clauses, and in gerundial constructions:\n\nA distinction is made between the above type of clause and a superficially similar construction where a word with the form of a past participle is used as predicative adjective, and the verb \"be\" or similar is simply a copula linking the subject of the sentence to that adjective. For example:\nis not passive voice, because \"excited\" here is not a verb form (as it would be in the passive \"the electron was excited with a laser pulse\"), but an adjective denoting a state. See below.\n\nThough the passive \"can\" be used for the purpose of concealing the agent, this is not a valid way of identifying the passive, and many other grammatical constructions can be used to accomplish this. Not every expression that serves to take focus away from the performer of an action is an instance of passive voice. For instance \"There were mistakes.\" and \"Mistakes occurred.\" are both in the active voice. Occasionally, authors express recommendations about use of the passive unclearly or misapply the term \"passive voice\" to include sentences of this type. An example of this incorrect usage can be found in the following extract from an article from \"The New Yorker\" about Bernard Madoff (bolding and italics added; bold text indicates the verbs misidentified as passive voice):\n\nTwo sentences later, Madoff said, \"When I began the Ponzi scheme, I believed it would end shortly, and I would be able to extricate myself, and my clients, from the scheme.\" As he read this, he betrayed no sense of how absurd it was \"to use the passive voice\" in regard to his scheme, as if it were a spell of bad weather that had descended on him . . . In most of the rest of the statement, one not only heard \"the aggrieved passive voice\", but felt the hand of a lawyer: \"To the best of my recollection, my fraud began in the early nineteen-nineties.\"\n\nThe intransitive verbs \"would end\" and \"began\" are in fact in the active voice. Although the speaker may be using words in a manner that diverts responsibility from him, this is not being accomplished by use of passive voice.\n\nThe passive voice can be used without referring to the agent of an action; it may therefore be used when the agent is unknown or unimportant, or the speaker does not wish to mention the agent.\n\nThe last sentence illustrates a frequently criticized use of the passive, as the evasion of responsibility by failure to mention the agent (which may even be the speaker themselves).\n\nHowever the passive voice can also be used together with a mention of the agent, usually using a \"by\"-phrase. In this case the reason for use of the passive is often connected with the positioning of this phrase at the end of the clause (unlike in the active voice, where the agent, as subject, normally precedes the verb). Here, in contrast to the examples above, passive constructions may in fact serve to place emphasis on the agent, since it is natural for information being emphasized to come at the end:\n\nIn more technical terms, such uses can be expected in sentences where the agent is the focus (\"comment\", \"rheme\"), while the patient (the undergoer of the action) is the \"topic\" or \"theme\" (see Topic–comment). There is a tendency for sentences to be formulated so as to place the focus at the end, which can motivate the choice of active or passive voice:\n\nSimilarly, the passive may be used because the noun phrase denoting the agent is a long one (containing many modifiers) since it is convenient to place such phrases at the end of a clause:\n\nIn some situations, the passive may be used so that the most dramatic word or the punchline appears at the end of the sentence.\n\nMany language critics and language-usage manuals discourage use of the passive voice. This advice is not usually found in older guides, emerging only in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1916, the British writer Arthur Quiller-Couch criticized this grammatical voice:\n\nGenerally, use transitive verbs, that strike their object; and use them in the active voice, eschewing the stationary passive, with its little auxiliary \"its’s\" and \"was’s\", and its participles getting into the light of your adjectives, which should be few. For, as a rough law, by his use of the straight verb and by his economy of adjectives you can tell a man’s style, if it be masculine or neuter, writing or 'composition'.\nTwo years later, in the original 1918 edition of \"The Elements of Style\", Cornell University Professor of English William Strunk, Jr. warned against excessive use of the passive voice:\n\nThe active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive . . . This rule does not, of course, mean that the writer should entirely discard the passive voice, which is frequently convenient and sometimes necessary . . . The need to make a particular word the subject of the sentence will often . . . determine which voice is to be used. The habitual use of the active voice, however, makes for forcible writing. This is true not only in narrative concerned principally with action, but in writing of any kind. Many a tame sentence of description or exposition can be made lively and emphatic by substituting a transitive in the active voice for some such perfunctory expression as \"there is\" or \"could be heard\".\nIn 1926, in \"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage\", Henry Watson Fowler recommended against transforming active voice forms into passive voice forms, because doing so \"...sometimes leads to bad grammar, false idiom, or clumsiness.\"\n\nIn 1946, in the essay \"Politics and the English Language\", George Orwell recommended the active voice as an elementary principle of composition: \"Never use the passive where you can use the active.\"\n\n\"The Columbia Guide to Standard American English\" states that:\n\"Active voice\" makes subjects do something (to something); \"passive voice\" permits subjects to have something done to them (by someone or something). Some argue that \"active voice\" is more muscular, direct, and succinct, \"passive voice\" flabbier, more indirect, and wordier. If you want your words to seem impersonal, indirect, and noncommittal, \"passive\" is the choice, but otherwise, \"active voice\" is almost invariably likely to prove more effective.\n\nUse of the passive is more prevalent in scientific writing, but publishers of some scientific publications, such as Nature, Science and the IEEE, explicitly encourage their authors to use active voice.\n\nThe principal criticism against the passive voice is its potential for evasion of responsibility. This is because a passive clause may be used to omit the agent even where it is important:\n\nKrista Ratcliffe, a professor at Marquette University, notes the use of passives as an example of the role of grammar as \"...a link between words and magical conjuring [...]: passive voice mystifies accountability by erasing who or what performs an action [...].\"\n\nJan Freeman, a columnist for \"The Boston Globe\", said that the passive voice does have its uses, and that \"all good writers use the passive voice.\"\n\nPassive writing is not necessarily slack and indirect. Many famously vigorous passages use the passive voice, as in these examples with the passive verbs italicized:\n\nWhile Strunk and White, in \"The Elements of Style\", encourage use of the active voice, they also state that the passive is often useful and sometimes preferable, even necessary, the choice of active or passive depending, for instance, on the topic of the sentence.\n\nAnother advisor, Joseph M. Williams, who has written several books on style, states with greater clarity that the passive is often the better choice. According to Williams, the choice between active and passive depends on the answers to three questions:\nBryan A. Garner, in \"Garner's Modern English Usage\", stresses the advantages of the active voice, but gives the following examples of where the passive is preferred:\n\"Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage\" recommends the passive voice when identifying the object (receiver) of the action is more important than the subject (agent), and when the agent is unknown, unimportant, or not worth mentioning:\nThe linguist Geoffrey Pullum writes that \"The passive is not an undesirable feature limited to bad writing, it's a useful construction often needed for clear expression, and every good writer uses it.\"\n\nDespite criticism that the passive can be used to hide responsibility by omitting the agent, the passive can also be used to emphasize the agent. Writers have preferred placing the agent at the end of a clause or sentence to give it greater emphasis, as in the examples given in the previous section:\n\nAgentless passives were once common in scientific writing, where the agent may be irrelevant, although at least one publisher considers this a \"fading practice\": \n\nThe passive voice is used more frequently in scientific writing than in other prose, where it is relatively rare.\n\nA statistical study of a variety of periodicals found a maximum incidence of 13 percent passive constructions. Despite Orwell's advice to avoid the passive, his \"Politics and the English Language\" employs passive voice for about 20 percent of its constructions.\n\nIn the most commonly considered type of passive clause, a form of the verb \"be\" (or sometimes \"get\") is used as an auxiliary together with the past participle of a transitive verb; that verb is missing its direct object, and the patient of the action (that which would be denoted by the direct object of the verb in an active clause) is denoted instead by the subject of the clause. For example, the active clause:\ncontains \"threw\" as a transitive verb with \"John\" as its subject and \"the ball\" as its direct object. If we recast the verb in the passive voice (\"was thrown\"), then \"the ball\" becomes the subject (it is \"promoted\" to the subject position) and \"John\" disappears:\nThe original subject (the agent) can optionally be re-inserted using the preposition \"by\".\n\nThe above example uses the verb \"be\" (in the past tense form \"was\") to make the passive. It is often possible to use the verb \"get\" as an alternative (possibly with slightly different meaning); for example, the active sentence \"The ball hit Bob\" may be recast in either of the following forms:\n\nThe auxiliary verb of the passive voice (\"be\" or \"get\") may appear in any combination of tense, aspect and mood, and can also appear in non-finite form (infinitive, participle or gerund). See the article on English verb forms for more information. Notice that this includes use of the verb \"be\" in progressive aspect, which does not normally occur when \"be\" is used as a simple copula. Some examples:\n\nUnlike some other languages, English also allows passive clauses in which an indirect object, rather than a direct object, is promoted to the subject. For example:\n\nIn the active form, \"gave\" is the verb; \"John\" is its subject, \"Mary\" its indirect object, and \"a book\" its direct object. In the passive forms, the indirect object has been promoted and the direct object has been left in place. (In this respect, English resembles dechticaetiative languages.)\n\nIt is normally only the first-appearing object that can be promoted; promotion of the indirect object takes place from a construction in which it precedes the direct object (i.e. where there is no \"to\" or \"for\" before the indirect object), whereas promotion of the direct object in such cases takes place from a construction in which the indirect object follows the direct object (this time being accompanied by \"to\" or \"for\"; see ). For example:\nSimilar restrictions apply to the prepositional passive, as noted in the following section.\n\nIt is also possible, in some cases, to promote the object of a preposition. This may be called the prepositional passive, or sometimes the pseudopassive (although the latter term can also have other meanings, such as being equivalent to the impersonal passive voice, particularly in descriptions of other languages).\nIn the passive form here, the preposition is \"stranded\"; that is, it is not followed by an object.\n\nThe prepositional passive is common, especially in informal English. However some potential uses are much less acceptable than others; compare the following examples:\nThe second sentence appears much less acceptable because sleeping above a bunk does not change its state; the verb phrase \"been slept above\" does not express a \"relevantly important property\" of the bunk.\n\nIt is not usually possible to promote a prepositional object if the verb also has a direct object; any passive rendering of the sentence must instead promote the direct object. For example:\n\nExceptions occur with certain idiomatic combinations of verb+object+preposition, such as \"take advantage of\":\n\nA type of clause that is similar or identical in form to the passive clauses described above has the past participle used to denote not an action, but a state being the result of an action. For example, the sentence \"The window was broken\" may have two different meanings:\n\nThe first sentence is an example of the canonical English passive as described above. However the second case is distinct; such sentences are not passive voice, because the participle is being used adjectivally; Such constructs are sometimes called \"false passives\" or \"stative passives\" (rarely called \"statal\", \"static\", or \"resultative passives\"), since they represent a state or result. By contrast the canonical passives, representing an action or event, may then be called \"dynamic\" or \"eventive\" passives.\n\nThe ambiguity in such sentences arises because the verb \"be\" is used in English both as the passive auxiliary and as the ordinary copular verb for linking to predicate adjectives. When \"get\" is used to form the passive, there is no ambiguity: \"The window got broken\" cannot have a stative meaning. (For ways in which some other languages make this distinction, see .) If a distinct adjective exists for the purpose of expressing the state, then the past participle is less likely to be used for that purpose; this is the case with the verb \"open\", for which there exists an adjective \"open\", so the sentence \"The door was opened\" more likely refers to the action rather than the state, since in the stative case one could simply say \"The door was open\".\n\nPast participles of transitive verbs can also be used as adjectives (as in \"a broken doll\"), and the participles used in the above-mentioned \"stative\" constructions are often considered to be adjectival (in predicative use). Such constructions may then also be called \"adjectival passives\" (although they are not normally considered true passives). For example:\nHere, \"relieved\" is an ordinary adjective, though it derives from the past participle of \"relieve\". In other sentences that same participle may be used to form the true (dynamic) passive: \"He was relieved of duty.\"\n\nWhen the verb being put into the passive voice is a stative verb anyway, the distinctions between uses of the past participle become less clear, since the canonical passive already has a stative meaning. (For example: \"People know his identity\" → \"His identity is known.\") However it is sometimes possible to impart a dynamic meaning using \"get\" as the auxiliary, as in \"get known\" with the meaning \"become known\".\n\nSome passive constructions are not derived exactly from a corresponding active construction in the ways described above. This is particularly the case with sentences containing content clauses (usually \"that\"-clauses). Given a sentence in which the role of direct object is played by such a clause, for example\nIt is possible to convert this to a passive by promoting the content clause to subject; in this case, however, the clause typically does not change its position in the sentence, and an expletive \"it\" takes the normal subject position:\n\nAnother way of forming passives in such cases involves promoting the subject of the content clause to the subject of the main clause, and converting the content clause into a non-finite clause with the \"to\"-infinitive. This infinitive is marked for grammatical aspect to correspond to the aspect (or past tense) expressed in the content clause. For example:\n\nSome verbs are used almost exclusively in the passive voice. This is the case with \"rumor\", for example. The following passive sentences are possible:\nbut it is not possible to use the active counterpart *\"They rumored that he was a war veteran.\" (This was once possible, but has fallen out of use.)\n\nAnother situation in which the passive uses a different construction than the active involves the verb \"make\", meaning \"compel\". When this verb is used in the active voice it takes the bare infinitive (without the particle \"to\"), but in the passive voice it takes the \"to\"-infinitive. For example:\n\nThe construction called double passive can arise when one verb appears in the \"to\"-infinitive as the complement of another verb.\n\nIf the first verb takes a direct object ahead of the infinitive complement (this applies to raising-to-object verbs, where the expected subject of the second verb is raised to the position of object of the first verb), then the passive voice may be used independently for either or both of the verbs:\nOther verbs which can behave similarly to \"expect\" in such constructions include \"order\", \"tell\", \"persuade\", etc., leading to such double passives as \"The man was ordered to be shot\" and \"I was persuaded to be ordained\".\n\nSimilar constructions sometimes occur, however, when the first verb is raising-to-subject rather than raising-to-object – that is, when there is no object before the infinitive complement. For example, with \"attempt\", the active voice construction is simply \"We attempted to complete the project\". A double passive formed from that sentence would be:\nwith both verbs changed simultaneously to the passive voice, even though the first verb takes no object – it is not possible to say \"*We attempted the project to be completed\", which is the sentence from which the double passive would appear to derive.\n\nThis latter double passive construction is criticized as questionable both grammatically and stylistically. Fowler calls it \"clumsy and incorrect\", suggesting that it springs from false analogy with the former (acceptable) type of double passive, though conceding its usefulness in some legal and quasi-legal language. Other verbs mentioned (besides \"attempt\") with which the construction is found include \"begin\", \"desire\", \"hope\", \"propose\", \"seek\" and \"threaten\". Similarly, \"The American Heritage Book of English Usage\" declares this construction unacceptable. It nonetheless occurs in practice in a variety of contexts.\n\nCertain other constructions are sometimes classed as passives. The following types are mentioned by Pullum.\n\nA \"bare passive clause\" is similar to a typical passive clause, but without the passive auxiliary verb (so it is a non-finite clause consisting of a subject together with a verb phrase based on a past participle with the passive construction). These can be used in such contexts as newspaper headlines:\nand as modifiers (adverbial phrases), i.e. nominative absolutes:\n\nOther constructions are mentioned in which a passive past participle clause is used, even though it is not introduced by the auxiliary \"be\" or \"get\" (or is introduced by \"get\" with a direct object):\n\nIn the \"concealed passive\", the present participle or gerund form (\"-ing\" form) appears rather than the past participle. This can appear after \"need\", and for some speakers after \"want\" (with similar meaning). For example:\n(An idiomatic expression with the same construction is \"... doesn't bear thinking about\".) \n\nThe concealed passive (with an \"-ing\" form) can also be used in a complex construction; Huddleston gives the following example:\nSee also .\n\nThe term \"middle voice\" is sometimes used to refer to verbs used without a passive construction, but in a meaning where the grammatical subject is understood as undergoing the action. The meaning may be reflexive:\nbut is not always:\n\nSuch verbs may also be called \"passival\".\n\nAnother construction sometimes referred to as \"passival\" involves a wider class of verbs, and was used in English until the nineteenth century. Sentences having this construction feature progressive aspect and resemble the active voice, but with meaning like the passive. Examples of this would be:\nA rare example of the passival form being used in modern English is with the following phrase:\nThis passival construction was displaced during the late 18th and early 19th century by the progressive passive (the form \"is being built\" as given above). The grammaticality of the progressive passive, called by some the \"imperfect passive,\" was controversial among grammarians in the 19th century, but is accepted without question today. It has been suggested that the passive progressive appeared just to the east of Bristol and was popularized by the Romantic poets.\n\n\n"}

It was directed and co-written by Samuel Fuller.\n\nThe film is a loose remake of \"The Street with No Name\" (1948), using the same screenwriter (Harry Kleiner) and cinematographer (Joseph MacDonald).\n\nIn 1954, a military train guarded by American soldiers and Japanese police is robbed of its cargo of guns, ammunition, and smoke bombs. Five weeks later, a thief named Webber lies dying in a Tokyo hospital, shot by one of his own cohorts during a holdup in which smoke bombs were used. Webber is questioned by military and police investigators, but he refuses to implicate his fellow gang members. Webber does reveal, however, that he is secretly married to a Japanese woman named Mariko. Police also discover that among Webber's possessions, there is a letter from an American named Eddie Spanier, who wants to join Webber in Japan after his release from a U.S. prison.\n\nThree weeks later, Spanier arrives in Tokyo and makes contact with Mariko, gaining her trust with a photograph of himself taken with Webber. Later, Spanier goes to a \"pachinko\" parlor, attempting to sell \"protection\" to the manager. But when he tries to shake down another parlor, he is beaten by a group of Americans led by racketeer Sandy Dawson, who is so intrigued with Spanier's audacity that he later arranges for him to join his gang, a disgruntled group of former American servicemen who have been dishonorably discharged. After being accepted into the gang, Spanier secretly meets with U.S. and Japanese investigators, for whom he is actually working undercover. To solidify his cover, Spanier asks Mariko to live with him as his \"kimono girl.\" Hoping to discover who killed Webber, Mariko consents to Spanier's offer. In the meantime, Dawson grows to trust Spanier and even saves his life when Eddie is wounded during a robbery.\n\nSpanier finally informs Mariko of his real identity as an undercover infiltrator into the Dawson gang. And when Charlie, one of Dawson's men spies Mariko meeting with an American army officer to fill him in on the details of the Dawson gang's next heist, he notifies Dawson. The job is thus aborted, but an outside informant reveals to Dawson that (a) the police are poised to capture him and that (b) Spanier is a military plant. Dawson thus sets up Spanier's death, but that plan backfires. Dawson is chased by the police to a rooftop amusement park. After an intense gunfight, Spanier shoots and kills Dawson.\n\n\nThe narration at the film's beginning tells the viewer that the film was photographed entirely on location in Tokyo, Yokohama, and the Japanese countryside. At movie's end, an acknowledgments credit thanks \"the Military Police of the U.S. Army Forces Far East and the Eighth Army, as well as the Government of Japan and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department\" for their cooperation with the film's production.\n\nThe film was one of a number of 20th Century Fox movies produced by Buddy Adler being shot on location in Asia around this time. Others included \"Soldier of Fortune\", \"The Left Hand of God\" and \"Love is a Many Splendored Thing\". It was the second Cinemascope Fox film that Samuel Fuller made for the studio.\n\nFuller, Stack and Yamaguchi arrived in Japan on 26 January 1955.\n\nThe staff of \"Variety\" magazine wrote of the film, \"Novelty of scene and a warm, believable performance by Japanese star Shirley Yamaguchi are two of the better values in the production. Had story treatment and direction been on the same level of excellence, \"House\" would have been an all round good show. Pictorially, the film is beautiful to see; the talk's mostly in the terse, tough idiom of yesteryear mob pix.\"\n\nFilm critic Keith Uhlich believes the film is an excellent example of wide-screen photography. He wrote in a review, \"Quite simply, \"House of Bamboo\" has some of the most stunning examples of widescreen photography in the history of cinema. Traveling to Japan on 20th Century Fox's dime, Fuller captured a country divided, trapped between past traditions and progressive attitudes while lingering in the devastating aftereffects of an all-too-recent World War. His visual schema represents the societal fractures through a series of deep-focus, Non-theatrical tableaus, a succession of silhouettes, screens, and stylized color photography that melds the heady insanity of a Douglas Sirk melodrama (see, as an especial point of comparison, Sirk's 1956 Korea-set war film \"Battle Hymn\") with the philosophical inquiry of the best noirs.\"\n\nFor many years after its initial release, the film was only seen on TV in pan-and-scan prints, leading people to believe that DeForest Kelley has a small role near the end of the film. When Fox finally struck a new 35mm CinemaScope print for a film festival in the 1990s, viewers were surprised to see that Kelley was in the film all the way through—he was just always off to one side and thus had been panned out of the frame.\n\nA scene from \"House of Bamboo\" is briefly shown prominently, but enigmatically, in the 2002 film \"Minority Report\".\n\n\n"}

A descendant of the Mayflower Pilgrims, the Dickinson family had been settled in the United States for generations. His family moved to Cornwall, Ontario in 1827. By 1847, he had established a business transporting goods on the Rideau Canal between Ottawa and Kingston. By 1850, Moss owned 16 steamers and 60 barges. Locals started to call him the 'King of the Rideau'.\n\nDickinson saw promise on Long Island in the middle of the Rideau River. He purchased seven acres of land in the town he named Manotick. Dickinson chose the name 'Manotick' from the Algonquin word for 'island'.\n\nIn 1860, with Joseph Merrill Currier, he completed construction of the Long Island Flouring Mill in Manotick, Ontario. He also built a sawmill, carding mill and bung factory. This served as the economic basis for the formation of the village. The grist mill is today called Watson's Mill and is open to the public as a museum.\n\nMoss Kent Dickinson applied to five Order-in-Councils during his life. His son, George Dickinson, applied to two. The Orders-in-Councils were either about a lease of water power or for timber limits. The timber grants were in the North-West Territories. The timber grants provided additional income for the Dickinsons. John A. Macdonald signed Moss Kent Dickinson's and George's Orders-in-Council. It was more of a standard procedure of the Prime Minister than an indicator of a specific benevolence extended towards the family. Wilfrid Laurier had signed George's last Order-in-Council dated March 31, 1903. George had applied for a grant of water bulkheads to Long Island.\n\nDickinson served as mayor of Ottawa from 1864 to 1866. Under his leadership, the Ottawa City Passenger Railway was incorporated. It was the first public transit system in Ottawa. The system consisted of horse-drawn tramcars that rode on iron rails.\n\nDickinson was also elected in the riding of Russell in the 1882 federal election. (Dickinson was the last non-Liberal MP for Russell County until Pierre Lemieux was elected in 2006, a span of 124 years.) His son George Lemuel also served in the House of Commons.\n\nMacdonald visited Manotick once, on February 10, 1887. He gave a speech at the large hall over Dickinson's lumber mill. Macdonald mentioned that he was \"happy to meet his constituents in Manotick.\" He had dinner at the Dickinson's residence afterwards. Their conversations were brief, as Macdonald left that night to return to Ottawa.\n\nPatronage was a key theme in Dickinson's relationship with Macdonald. This was prominent in their correspondence. It spanned through many years, with the first letter in 1863 and the last in the year of Macdonald's death, 1891. The 28 years of correspondence yielded only 38 letters. Dickinson wrote 31 of them and Macdonald wrote 7. Most of the letters were about appointments or political favours for him or his friends.\n\nTogether with his wife Elizabeth, Dickinson had five children: George, Charlotte, William, Lydia and Elizabeth. He also had another son, Alpheus, who died in infancy. Lydia died at age 15 of tuberculosis. None of Dickinson's children ever married, leaving him with no descendants.\n\nHe died in Manotick in 1897. Dickinson is buried in Beechwood Cemetery beside his wife. Dickinson Days are celebrated in Manotick on the first weekend in June, to coincide with Dickinson's birthday.\n\n"}

Zimmerman graduated from Kellam High School in Virginia Beach, Virginia and played college baseball at the University of Virginia. He is nicknamed Mr. National as he has been a member of the Washington Nationals since his debut on September 1, 2005, and was the team's first ever draft pick when the Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise moved from Montreal. Zimmerman was drafted in the first round as the fourth overall pick by the Nationals in the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft. He is well known for his clutch hitting and walkoff hits. Formerly a third baseman, Zimmerman transitioned to first base in 2015.\n\nPrior to college, Zimmerman played on the same AAU team as B.J. Upton and David Wright. As a high schooler in 2000, he played on a \"showcase team\" with Wright, B.J. Upton, Mark Reynolds and Justin Upton.\n\nZimmerman played high school baseball as a shortstop at Floyd E. Kellam High School in Virginia Beach. Until late in his senior year, James Madison, Charlotte and UNC Wilmington were the only Division I programs to show interest in him. He later received a scholarship offer from Virginia.\n\nA three-year starting third baseman for the Virginia Cavaliers in the Atlantic Coast Conference, Zimmerman started in all 174 games he appeared in, and his collegiate career statistics include 250 hits, 140 RBIs, 128 runs, 47 doubles, seven triples and nine home runs. He was successful on 32 of 39 stolen base attempts. His career totals are among the top ten in Virginia statistical categories for doubles (5th), hits (6th) and RBI (7th). Zimmerman established the school record of hits in a season with 90 in 2004, breaking his own record with 92 in 2005.\n\nIn his final collegiate season, Zimmerman led the Cavaliers with a .393 average, .581 slugging percentage, 136 total bases, 92 hits, 59 RBIs, and 51 runs. He coupled his high batting average with striking out just 14 times in the full season. Through August 2011, he was one of 29 former UVA players to have made it to the major leagues, along with among others former Cavaliers Michael Schwimer, Javier López, and Mark Reynolds.\n\nZimmerman's collegiate awards and honors include 2005 All-American by \"Baseball America\", 2005 All-American by National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association, 2005 All-ACC selection, 2005 ACC All-Tournament Team and 2005 Virginia College Sports Information Directors (VaSID) Player of the Year. He was also a 2004 First Team All-ACC selection, 2004 VaSID All-State Team selection and named to the 2004 Charlottesville NCAA Regional All-Tournament Team.\n\nZimmerman started at third base for the 2004 USA Baseball National Team that won the gold medal in the FISU II World University Baseball Championship. Zimmerman's summer with Team USA included starting 18 of 24 games and leading the team in batting average (.468), hits (36), RBI (27), runs (25), doubles (12), home runs (4), slugging percentage (.805) and total bases (62). He also posted a .933 fielding percentage and won the team Triple Crown. In his sophomore year in college he batted over .400 in the 9th inning with 2 runners on base.\n\nZimmerman's .468 batting average set a national team single-season record and was a factor in his earning the World University Championship tournament MVP.\n\nHe won the USA Baseball Richard W. \"Dick\" Case Player of the Year Award in 2004.\n\nZimmerman was drafted in the first round as the fourth overall pick by the Washington Nationals in the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft. After being signed on the day he was drafted, he was sent to the Savannah Sand Gnats, the Nationals' minor league A-level affiliate and then quickly moved up to the Harrisburg Senators, the AA affiliate.\n\nZimmerman was called up to the majors when rosters expanded in September 2005, and shared third base duties with Vinny Castilla, taking over the position on a more permanent basis between the time the Nationals were mathematically eliminated from playoff contention and the end of the season. In his first major league at bat at RFK Stadium he muscled a double to right center. Over the course of 20 games, he posted a .397 batting average, 10 doubles, and 6 RBIs in 58 at-bats. He was the only member of the 2005 team to hit over .300 in at least 50 at-bats.\n\nHe remained with the Major League club to start the 2006 campaign, taking over third base duties from Castilla, who was traded to the San Diego Padres. Prior to 2006 Spring Training, Zimmerman changed his jersey number from #25 (2005) to #11, his former college number.\n\nOn April 5, 2006, he hit his first Major League home run off a 93-mph fastball in the ninth inning against Mets' closer Billy Wagner. It sailed into the second deck in Shea Stadium, tied the game in the top of the ninth inning, and allowed the Nationals to go on to win their first game of the 2006 season by a score of 9–5 in extra innings.\n\nOn June 18, 2006, Father's Day, with his father in the stands, Zimmerman hit his tenth Major League home run and his first walk-off home run when he hit a 2-run shot in the bottom of the ninth inning to beat the New York Yankees 3–2. The usually stoic Zimmerman gleefully tossed his batting helmet in the air while rounding third and leaped onto home plate as his teammates crowded around him. He later took a curtain call and tossed his batting gloves into the stands.\n\nOn July 4, 2006, he hit a 3-run home run against Florida closer Joe Borowski on a two-strike pitch with two outs in the 9th inning of a game Washington was losing 4–3; the walk-off home run carried Washington to a 6–4 victory. This was Zimmerman's 12th career home run and his second walk-off. Two days later he delivered a walk-off single against the Marlins to win the game 8–7 in the 11th inning.\n\nOn September 27, 2006, against the Philadelphia Phillies, Zimmerman hit his 20th home run of the season and tied the Expos/Nationals franchise record for home runs by a rookie; in 2002, Brad Wilkerson hit 20 home runs for the Montreal Expos.\n\nDuring his first season as the Nationals' third baseman, Zimmerman became a hometown hero and a fan favorite through his defense and ability to come through in late-inning situations. Frank Robinson once compared Zimmerman's defense to that of Brooks Robinson, a former teammate of Frank Robinson's. During the 2006 spring training, Frank Robinson said that he thought 12 homers and 60 RBIs would be a realistic goal for his rookie infielder; Zimmerman exceeded those expectations and finished with 20 home runs and 110 RBIs. Along with those two figures, he finished the 2006 season with 156 games played, 612 at-bats, .288 batting average, .352 OBP, 84 runs scored, 176 hits, 47 doubles, 3 triples, and 11 steals. He led all Major Leaguers with 10 or more bunts in bunt hit percentage, at 83.3% with 10 bunt hits. Although he was named on more ballots (29–27), Zimmerman finished second in the 2006 NL Rookie of the Year voting to Florida Marlins shortstop Hanley Ramírez in the closest Rookie of the Year vote ever.\n\nOn a game that began on May 12, 2007, but ended at 1:42 am the next day (Mother's Day), Zimmerman hit a two-out bottom-of-the-ninth grand slam to rally the Nationals past the Florida Marlins, 7–3.\n\nOn June 22, 2007, Zimmerman fielded a routine ground ball that ended up in his jersey. As he bent over to underhand the ball at his stomach level, his jersey top opened and hung down in front of his glove, causing the ball to go into his jersey instead of his positioned glove.\n\nOn July 4, 2007, Zimmerman hit a two-out go-ahead home run in the first inning against the Chicago Cubs. The one-run home run would have been considered routine had it not continued a trend that led to Zimmerman being declared a \"human fireworks\" show by an ESPN.com article. The Independence Day home run marked Zimmerman's fifth game-ending or go-ahead home run on a holiday. Zimmerman hit home runs on Father's Day in 2006 and 2007, Independence Day in 2006 and 2007, and Mother's Day in 2007. Per ESPN.com, Zimmerman was quoted as saying, \"I wish every day was a holiday.\"\n\nOn August 3, 2007, Zimmerman delivered his sixth walk-off game-winner in his first two seasons with a single to left, giving the Nationals a 3–2 win over the visiting St. Louis Cardinals. With another walk-off in September, Zimmerman produced seven walk-offs with three via home run, three via singles, and one via bases-loaded walk, in less than two seasons. Manager Manny Acta stated, \"He has done some dramatic stuff since he's been up here…he doesn't get rattled when that situation comes up, and I think that's what he has shown here the last two years.\" Subsequent to the game, Zimmerman was presented the 2006 Larry Doby Legacy Award for his achievements during his rookie season.\n\nOn August 4, 2007, Zimmerman had his first career multi-homer day, hitting a solo shot in the fourth and a two-run homer in the sixth in a 12–1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nIn November 2007 during offseason Zimmerman participated in a homerun derby fundraiser for Grassfield High School in Chesapeake, Virginia. Participants included Michael Cuddyer who won the derby, Justin Upton, B.J. Upton, David Wright, and Mark Reynolds (baseball); all of whom are from the Hampton Roads area. Zimmerman broke his wrist and could not complete the derby and required surgery prior to the 2008 season.\n\nOn March 30, the Washington Nationals played the Atlanta Braves in the first regular season major league baseball game in the new Nationals Park. In that game, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Zimmerman hit a walk-off home run off of the Braves' Peter Moylan, giving the Nationals a 3–2 win. It was the first home run hit by a Nationals player in the history of their new ballpark. Zimmerman was placed on the disabled list on June 3, 2008 with a small labral tear in his left shoulder. He rejoined the team July 22, 2008, after a short minor league assignment. On February 20, 2009, Zimmerman agreed to a $3.325 million, one-year deal for 2009, avoiding arbitration.\n\nOn April 20, 2009, Zimmerman signed a five-year, $45 million contract with the Nationals through the 2013 season, replacing the one year, $3.325 million contract he had agreed to in February in order to avoid arbitration. He hit safely in 30 consecutive games, the longest such streak by any player since 2006. That streak was broken May 13 against the Giants, going 0-for-3 with two walks in five plate appearances; he hit into a fielder's choice in his last at-bat. His streak of reaching base (via hit or walk) in 43 consecutive games ended on May 26. On July 5, 2009, he was selected to his first All-Star Game. On September 6, 2009, he hit a walk-off two-run homer against the Florida Marlins to give the Nationals a 5–4 win. On November 11, 2009, he won a Gold Glove Award as the best defensive third baseman in the National League, and on November 12, 2009 he won a Silver Slugger Award as the best offensive third baseman in the league. Zimmerman also won a Fielding Bible Award as Major League Baseball's best fielding third baseman. He also won the ESPN WEB Gem Award, which is given to the player with the most Top 10 plays on SportsCenter. He was the first player given the award and as of this year, the only player.\n\nZimmerman hit his 100th career home run on May 30, 2010 at Petco Park, he became the second player to reach this milestone in the '05 draft class. He would later homer again to have his 7th multi-homer game of his career. Zimmerman hit 25 home runs, 85 RBIs, and had his first .300 batting average with .307. On November 11, 2010, Zimmerman won his second Silver Slugger Award at third base.\n\nZimmerman started off the season hot batting .357 through April 9. On that day Zimmerman was injured, and on April 11 was placed on the 15-Day DL with an abdominal strain. It wasn't until June 14 that the Nationals star 3rd baseman came back to play against the Cardinals. As of July 9, Zimmerman was hitting .252, with 4 homers and 15 RBIs, with 15 runs scored and 1 stolen base. On August 19, 2011, Zimmerman hit a walk-off grand slam to give the Nationals an 8–4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nOn February 26, 2012, Zimmerman signed a 6-year, $100 million extension that runs through 2019 and includes a $24 million club option for 2020. His extension also includes a full no-trade clause, effective 2014. Zimmerman had previously set a deadline of the day before to sign an extension. Zimmerman will earn $12 million in 2012, $84 million from 2013 to 2018 at $14 million annually, $18 million in 2019, and either $18 million if the Nationals pick up his option, or $2 million if they buy him out. After he retires, he will earn $10 million more over the course of 5 years while working for the club. If the Nationals trade him before his no-trade clause takes effect, he will earn an additional $8 million. Zimmerman could make as little as $126 million, or as much as $150 million.\n\nOn April 27, the Nationals placed Zimmerman on the 15-day Disabled List with shoulder inflammation, retroactive to April 21. He returned May 6.\n\nZimmerman struggled early in the 2012 season due to shoulder pain, hitting only .218 with 3 home runs in his first 55 games. He received a cortisone injection on June 24 to mitigate the pain, with apparent results: in his next 25 games, he hit .392 with 11 home runs and 28 RBI. He brought his OPS up from .590 to .801. For his much-improved performance by mid-July, Zimmerman was awarded the NL Player of the Week.\n\nZimmerman underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder in the off-season to repair the scar tissue that had bothered him in 2012. He spent much of the winter rehabilitating it to get ready for the season, although his doctors estimate he may not regain full strength in it until June. On May 29 Zimmerman had first three home run game as the Nationals lost to the Orioles 9-6. On July 26, 2013, Zimmerman hit his ninth career walkoff home run against the Mets. He completed the season batting .275 with 26 home runs, 79 runs batted in, and 6 stolen bases over a total of 147 games played.\n\nAfter returning from an injury and with Anthony Rendon playing well at third base, Zimmerman played left field for the Nationals. On June 24, three weeks after returning, Zimmerman hit a 2-run home run in the 16th inning against the Milwaukee Brewers. Zimmerman, playing left field, caught the final out to what as at the time the longest game by innings in Nationals history.\n\nAfter the season, the Nationals declined the option of first baseman Adam LaRoche, indicating Zimmerman would permanently move to first base in 2015 due to his many shoulder injuries, with Rendon taking over as starting third baseman.\n\nOn May 19, 2015, Zimmerman hit his 10th career walk-off home run, ranking him third all time in National League walk-off home runs. On September 4, Zimmerman hit two home runs in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, the second of which was his 200th career home run.\n\nOn May 15, 2016, Zimmerman hit his first career inside-the-park home run. Outfielders Marcell Ozuna and Giancarlo Stanton violently collided into each other going after the ball that was hit to the right-center field warning track, and both fell to the ground on the outfield warning track.\n\nZimmerman enjoyed a major offensive return to form during the 2017 Washington Nationals season, and he was voted onto the National League All-Star roster as the starting first baseman, his first selection to the All-Star Game since 2009.\n\nOn April 29, Zimmerman hit a 470-foot homer, marking the longest ever hit at Nationals Park.\nOn July 17, Zimmerman hit his 235th career home run, setting a new Nationals/Expos franchise record. On July 27, Zimmerman hit the fourth consecutive home run by Nationals hitters off Milwaukee Brewers starter Michael Blazek, the first time the feat had been accomplished in Major League Baseball since the 2011 season.\n\nOn August 9, Zimmerman set the Nationals' franchise record for most runs batted in, earning his 906th RBI on a solo home run against the Miami Marlins. He finished the night by going 4 for 4 with two home runs and 5 RBIs. On August 11, he tied his career high for RBIs in a game, with six, during a contest against the Chicago Cubs in which he also hit two home runs, both coming off of Cubs starter Jon Lester.\n\nZimmerman was awarded the 2017 Players Choice Award Comeback Player of the Year Award.\n\nZimmerman missed nearly half of the 2018 season due to an oblique injury. He batted .264/.337/.486 with 13 home runs in 85 games.\n\nOn August 22, Zimmerman hit his 11th career walk-off home run against the Philadelphia Phillies off Seranthony Dominguez. His 11 walk offs had him in a three-way tie for 8th most all time.\n\nIn 2019 he batted .257/.321/.415 with six home runs and 27 RBIs in 171 at bats.\n\nOn October 22, 2019, he hit the first World Series home run in Nationals franchise history. The World Series would go on for a full 7 games, and the Nationals won it for the first time in franchise history. \n\nThe Nationals declined to exercise an $18 million club option for Zimmerman for the 2020 season, making Zimmerman a free agent for the first time in his career. On January 28, 2020, Zimmerman signed a one-year, $2 million contract to return to the Nationals.\n\nZimmerman's mother, Cheryl, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1995, and has needed to use a wheelchair since 2000. Zimmerman has cited his mother's condition as a substantial formative influence on his development, saying that it forced him to grow up and assume responsibilities at an earlier age than most children. He also founded the ziMS Foundation, which is dedicated to treating and curing multiple sclerosis.\n\nZimmerman became engaged to Heather Downen, a tech-firm sales representative, in April 2012, and they married in January 2013. The couple welcomed their first child, a daughter named Mackenzie, in November 2013. Their second child, a daughter named Hayden, was born in June 2016.\n\nOn January 5, 2016, it was announced that Zimmerman had filed a lawsuit suing \"Al Jazeera\" for defamation following the publication's release of the documentary \"\"\"\", which linked Zimmerman and Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard, among others, to a clinic that allegedly distributed steroids and HGH.\n\n\n"}

While Metra doesn't explicitly refer to any of its eleven routes by colors, the NCS' timetable accents are lavender, a shade of purple. It is the only Metra line that does not have a specific color for a fallen flag railroad that used to operate on this route.\n\nBetween Union Station and River Grove stations the North Central Service shares tracks with the Milwaukee District/West Line, but does not stop at any of the intermediate stations used by the MD-W between Western Avenue and River Grove. About a mile west of River Grove, this route turns north at a junction known as tower B-12. The rest of the route operates on track owned and dispatched by the Canadian National Railway (\"CN\"). A single daily inbound train, #120, makes all stops along the North Central Service from Antioch to Washington Street, then switches to the Milwaukee District/North Line's tracks at a diamond in Grayslake, makes stops at Libertyville and Lake Forest, and then runs express to Union Station.\n\nThe CN assumed ownership of this route on September 7, 2001 when it absorbed the Wisconsin Central Railroad (\"WC\"). The WC operated this route after it was purchased from the Soo Line Railroad in April 1987.

{"id": "2009296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009296", "title": "Sieve tube element", "text": "Sieve tube element\n\nSieve elements are specialized cells that are important for the function of phloem, which is a highly organized tissue that transports organic compounds made during photosynthesis. Sieve elements are the major conducting cells in phloem. Conducting cells aid in transport of molecules especially for long-distance signaling. In plant anatomy, there are two main types of sieve elements which are sieve cells and sieve tube members. Sieve cells are specialized cells in the phloem tissue of flowering plants. Companion cells and Sieve cells originate from meristems, which are tissues that actively divide throughout a plant's lifetime. They are similar to the development of xylem, a water conducting cells in plants whose main function is also transportation in the plant vascular system. Sieve elements' major function includes transporting sugars over long distance through plants by acting as a channel. Sieve elements elongate cells containing sieve areas on their walls. Pores on sieve areas allow for cytoplasmic connections to neighboring cells, which allows for the movement of photosynthetic material and other organic molecules necessary for tissue function. Structurally, they are elongated and parallel to the organ or tissue that they are located in. Sieve elements typically lack a nucleus and contain none to a very small number of ribosomes. The two types of sieve elements, sieve tube members and sieve cells, have different structure. Sieve tube members are shorter and wider with greater area for nutrient transport while sieve cells tend to be longer and narrower with smaller area for nutrient transport. Although the function of both of these kinds of sieve elements is the same, sieve cells are found in gymnosperms, non-flowering vascular plants, while sieve tube members are found in angiosperms, flowering vascular plants.\n\nSieve elements were first discovered by the forest botanist Theodor Hartig in 1837. Since this discovery, the structure and physiology of phloem tissue has been emphasized more as there has been greater focus on its specialized components such as the sieve cells. Phloem was introduced by Carl Nägeli in 1858 after the discovery of sieve elements. Since then, multiple studies have been conducted on how sieve elements function in phloem in terms of working as a transport mechanism. An example of analysis of phloem through sieve elements was conducted in the study of Arabidopsis leaves. By studying the phloem of the leaves in vivo through laser microscopy and the usage of fluorescent markers (placed in both companion cells and sieve elements), the network of companion cells with the compact sieve tubes was highlighted. The markers for sieve elements and companion cells was used to study the network and organization of phloem cells.\n\nThere are two categories of sieve elements: sieve cells and sieve tube members. The main functions of sieve tube members include maintaining cells and transporting necessary molecules with the help of companion cells. The sieve tube members are living cells (which do not contain a nucleus) that are responsible for transporting carbohydrates throughout the plant. Sieve tube members are associated with companion cells, which are cells that combine with sieve tubes to create the sieve element-companion cell complex. This allows for supply and maintenance of the plant cells and for signaling between distant organs within the plant. Sieve tubes members do not have ribosomes or a nucleus and thus need companion cells to help them function as transport molecules. Companion cells provide Sieve tube members with proteins necessary for signaling and ATP in order to help them transfer molecules between different parts of the plant. It is the companion cells that helps transport carbohydrates from outside the cells into the sieve tube elements. The companion cells also allow for bidirectional flow.\n\nWhile sieve tube members are responsible for a lot of the signaling necessary for the plant's organs, only some proteins are active within the sieve tubes. This is due to the fact that sieve tube members do not have ribosomes to synthesize protein as this makes it harder to determine which active proteins are specifically related to the sieve tube elements.\n\nSieve tube members and companion cells are connected through plasmodesmata. Plasmodesmata consists of channels between cell walls of adjacent plant cells for transport and cell to cell recognition. Structurally, the walls of sieve tubes tend to be dispersed with plasmodesmata grouped together and it is these areas of the tube walls and plasmodesmata that develop into sieve plates over time. Sieve tube members tend to be found largely in angiosperms. They are very long and have horizontal end walls containing sieve plates. Sieve plates contain sieve pores which can regulate the size of the openings in the plates with changes in the surroundings of the plants. These sieve plates are very large which means that there is a greater surface area for material transport.\n\nSieve tube members are arranged from end to end in a longitudinal manner in order to form sieve tubes. Formed through these vertical connections between multiple sieve tube members, sieve tubes are directly responsible for the transport through the minimum resistance surrounding their walls. By having the assistance of these pores that constitute a majority of the structure of sieve plates, the diameter of the sieve tubes can be regulated. This regulation is necessary for the sieve tubes to respond to changes in the environment and conditions within the organism.\n\nSieve cells are long, conducting cells in the phloem that do not form sieve tubes. The major difference between sieve cells and sieve tube members is the lack of sieve plates in sieve cells. They have a very narrow diameter and tend to be longer in length than sieve tube elements as they are generally associated with albuminous cells. Similar to how Sieve Tube members are associated with companion cells, sieve cells are flanked with albuminous cells in order to aid in transporting organic material. Albuminous cells have long, unspecialized areas with ends that overlap with those of other sieve cells and contain nutrients and store food in order to nourish tissues. They enable the sieve cells to be connected to parenchyma, functional tissue in the organs, which helps to stabilize the tissue and transport nutrients. Sieve cells are also associated with gymnosperms because they lack the companion cell and sieve member complexes that angiosperms have. Sieve cells are very uniform and have an even distribution across of sieve areas. Their narrow pores are necessary in their function in most seedless vascular plants and gymnosperms which lack sieve-tube members and only have sieve cells to transport molecules. While sieve cells have smaller sieve areas, they are still distributed across several cells to still effectively transport material to various tissue within the plant.\n\nSieve cell associated albuminous cells work between phloem and parenchyma. They connect parenchyma with mature sieve cells to help participate in transport of cells. There can be many of these albuminous cells that belong to one sieve cell, depending on the function of the tissue or organ.\n\nSieve pores are very common in the areas that have overlapping sieve cells. Callose levels are measure in order to observe the activity of sieve cells. Callose acts as a block to the sieve pores that are present in both of these sieve elements. A lack callose suggests that the sieve elements are more active and therefore can regulate their pores more actively in response to environmental changes.\n\nBecause the plant vascular system is vital in growth and development of plant cells and the organs within the plant, the role of sieve elements in the transport of necessary carbohydrates and macromolecules is largely expanded. This can be applied to agriculture to observe the way resources are distributed to various parts of the plant. Plasmodesmata connect companion cells to sieve elements and parenchyma cells can connect the sieve tubes to various tissues within the plant. This system between the plasmodesmata, companion cells, and sieve tubes allow for the delivery of necessary metabolites. The yield of agricultural product could potentially be increased to maximize the delivery system of these specialized cells within the phloem in a way that diffusion can be maximized. It has been discovered that the angiosperm phloem can use the sieve tubes as a way to transport various forms of RNA to sink tissues which can help alter transcriptional activity. Sink tissues are tissues that are in the process of growth and need nutrients. Having Sieve elements transport additional nutrients to sink tissues can speed up the growth process, which can affect plant growth and development. Overtime, rapid growth has the potential of leading to a greater agricultural output.\n\n"}

This disease causes illness in piglets, with clinical signs including progressive loss of body condition, visibly enlarged lymph nodes, difficulty in breathing, and sometimes diarrhea, pale skin, and jaundice. PCVD is very damaging to the pig-producing industry and has been reported worldwide. PCVD is caused by \"Porcine circovirus 2\" (PCV-2).\n\nThe North American industry endorses \"PCVAD\" and European use \"PCVD\" to describe this disease.\n\n\"Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome\" (\"PMWS\") is the classic PCVD entity, caused by PCV-2. PCV-2 has a near universal distribution – present in most pig herds. In contrast, PMWS is more sporadic in its distribution. Experimental induction of PMWS has not been achieved by PCV-2 infection alone, using infectious DNA clones of the virus or a pure form of PCV-2 derived from infectious DNA clones. Therefore, it is assumed that PMWS is a multifactorial disease. PCV-2 is necessary but not sufficient for the development of PMWS. However, viral infection by itself tends to cause only mild disease, and co-factors such as other infections or immunostimulation seem necessary for development of severe disease.[1] For example, concurrent infection with porcine parvovirus or PRRS virus, or immunostimulation lead to increased replication of PCV-2 and more severe disease in PCV-2-infected pigs. There is no significant correlation of the disease with virus sequence variation with affected and control pigs. Porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) was first identified in 1974 and was recognized as a non-disease-causing agent that frequently occurred in laboratory tissue cultures.\n\nBoth PMWS and \"porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome\" (\"PDNS\") are associated to PCV-2. Many pigs affected by the circovirus also seem to develop secondary bacterial infections, like Glässer disease (\"Haemophilus parasuis\"), pulmonary pasteurellosis, colibacilosis, salmonellosis and others. Postmortem lesions occur in multiple organs, especially in lymphoid tissues and lung, giving rise to the term \"multisystemic\". Lesions may also affect the skin, kidney, reproductive tissue, brain, or blood vessels.\n\nWasting pigs is the most common sign of PMWS infection, increasing the mortality rate significantly.\n\nFrançois Madec, a French author, has written many recommendations on how reduce PMWS symptoms. They are mostly measures for disinfection, management, and hygiene, referred to as the \"20 Madec Points\" [Madec & Waddilove, 2002].\n\nThese measures have recently been expanded upon by Dr. David Barcellos, a professor at the Veterinary College in the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. He presented these points at \"1st Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul Symposium about swine management, reproduction, and hygiene\".\n\nHe divided his points by pig growth stage, and they can be loosely summarized as:\n\n\n\n"}

It specializes in leather, lifestyle accessories, home furnishings, perfumery, jewellery, watches and ready-to-wear. Its logo, since the 1950s, is of a Duc carriage with horse. Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski is the current creative director.\n\nThierry Hermès was born in Krefeld, Germany, to a French father and a German mother. The family moved to France in 1828. In 1837, Hermès first established a harness workshop in the Grands Boulevards quarter of Paris, dedicated to serving European noblemen. He created high-quality wrought harnesses and bridles for the carriage trade, winning several awards including the first prize in its class in 1855 and again in 1867 at the Expositions Universelles in Paris.\n\nHermès's son, Charles-Émile, took over management from his father in 1880 and moved the shop to \"24 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré\", where it remains. With the help of his sons Adolphe and Émile-Maurice, Charles-Émile introduced saddlery and started selling his products retail. The company catered to the élite of Europe, North Africa, Russia, Asia, and the Americas. In 1900, the firm offered the \"Haut à Courroies\" bag, specially designed for riders to carry their saddles with them.\n\nAfter Charles-Émile Hermès's retirement, sons Adolphe and Émile-Maurice took leadership and renamed the company Hermès Frères. Shortly after, Émile-Maurice began furnishing the czar of Russia with saddles. By 1914, up to 80 saddle craftsmen were employed. Subsequently, Émile-Maurice was granted the exclusive rights to use the zipper for leather goods and clothing, becoming the first to introduce the device in France. In 1918, Hermès introduced the first leather golf jacket with a zipper, made for Edward, Prince of Wales. Because of its exclusive rights arrangement the zipper became known in France as the \"fermeture Hermès\" (Hermès fastener).\n\nThroughout the 1920s when he was the sole head of the firm, Émile-Maurice added accessories and clothing collections. He also groomed his three sons-in-law (Robert Dumas, Jean-René Guerrand, and Francis Puech) as business partners. In 1922, the first leather handbags were introduced after Émile-Maurice's wife complained of not being able to find one to her liking. Émile-Maurice created the handbag collection himself.\nIn 1924, Hermès established a presence in the United States and opened two shops outside of Paris. In 1929, the first women's couture apparel collection was previewed in Paris. During the 1930s, Hermès introduced some of its most recognized original goods such as the leather \"Sac à dépêches\" in 1935 (later renamed the \"Kelly bag\" after Grace Kelly) and the Hermès \"carrés\" (square scarves) in 1937.\n\nThe scarves became integrated into French culture. In 1938, the \"Chaîne d'ancre\" bracelet and the riding jacket and outfit joined the classic collection. By this point, the company's designers began to draw inspirations from paintings, books, and \"objets d'art\". The 1930s also witnessed Hermès's entry into the United States market by offering products in a Neiman Marcus department store in New York; however, it later withdrew. In 1949, the same year as the launch of the Hermès silk tie, the first perfume, \"Eau d'Hermès\", was produced.\n\nFrom the mid-1930s, Hermès employed Swiss watchmaker Universal Genève as the brand's first and exclusive designer of timepieces, producing a line of men's wrist chronographs (manufactured in 18K gold or stainless steel) and women's Art Déco cuff watches in 18K gold, steel, or platinum. Both models contained dials signed either \"Hermès\" or \"Hermès Universal Genève\", while the watch movements were signed \"Universal Genève S.A.\". The Hermès/Universal partnership lasted until the 1950s.\n\nÉmile-Maurice summarized the Hermès philosophy during his leadership as \"leather, sport, and a tradition of refined elegance.\"\n\nRobert Dumas-Hermès (1898–1978), who succeeded Émile-Maurice after his death in 1951, closely collaborated with brother-in-law Jean-René Guerrand. Dumas became the first man not directly descended from \"Hermès père\" to lead the company because his connection to the family was only through marriage. Thus, he incorporated the Hermès name into his own, Dumas-Hermès.\n\nThe company also acquired its Duc-carriage-with-horse logo and signature orange paper boxes in the early 1950s. Dumas introduced original handbags, jewelry, and accessories and was particularly interested in design possibilities with the silk scarves. Ironically, during the mid-20th century, scarf production diminished. World Tempus, a Web portal dedicated to watchmaking, states: \"Brought to life by the magic wand of Annie Beaumel, the windows of the store on the [rue du] Faubourg Saint-Honoré became a theatre of enchantment and [established the store as] a Parisian meeting-place for international celebrities.\" In 1956, \"Life\" magazine featured a photograph of Grace Kelly, who had become the new Princess of Monaco, carrying the \"Sac à dépêches\" bag. Purportedly, she held it in front of herself to disguise her pregnancy. Thus, when the public began calling it the \"Kelly\" bag, a name subsequently adopted by Hermès, it became hugely popular.\n\nThe perfume business became a subsidiary in 1961, concurrently with the introduction of the \"Calèche\" scent, named after a hooded four-wheeled horse carriage, known since the 18th century, and is also the company's logo since the 1950s. (In 2004, Jean-Claude Ellena became the in-house perfumer or \"nose\" and has created several successful scents, including the Hermessence line of fragrances.)\n\nDespite the company's apparent success in the 1970s, exemplified by multiple shops' being established worldwide, Hermès began to decline, compared to competitors. Some industry observers have assigned the cause to Hermès's insistence on the exclusive use of natural materials for its products, unlike other companies that were calling on new man-made materials. During a two-week lapse in orders, the Hermès workrooms were silent. The renewed success of Hermès's fragrances in the marketplace was probably due to the public's increasingly paradigmatic shift of back to natural materials as opposed to artificial. This point undoubtedly contributed to reestablishing Hermès's scents as a major player in the fragrances marketplace.\n\nJean-Louis Dumas, the son of Robert Dumas-Hermès, became chairman in 1978 and had the firm concentrate on silk and leather goods and ready-to-wear, adding new product groups to those made with its traditional techniques. Unlike his father, Jean-Louis was maternally related to the Hermès family. Travelling extensively and marrying Rena Greforiadès, he entered the buyer-training program at Bloomingdale's, the New York department store. Having joined the family firm in 1964, he was instrumental in turning around its decline.\n\nDumas brought in designers Eric Bergère and Bernard Sanz to revamp the apparel collection and, in collaboration, added unusual entries. They included the python motorcycle jackets and ostrich-skin jeans, which were dubbed as \"a snazzier version of what Hermès has been all along.\" (Annual sales in 1978, when Jean-Louis became head of the firm, were reported at US$50 million. By 1990, annual sales were reported at US$460 million, mainly due to Dumas's strategy.) In 1979, he launched an advertising campaign featuring a young, denim-clad woman wearing an Hermès scarf. The purpose was to introduce the Hermès brand to a new set of consumers. As one fashion-sector observer noted: \"Much of what bears the still-discreet Hermès label changed from the object of an old person's nostalgia to the subject of young peoples' dreams.\" However, Dumas's change-of-image created outrage both within and outside of the firm.\n\nAlso in the 1970s, the watch subsidiary, La Montre Hermès, was established in Bienne, Switzerland. Then, throughout the 1980s, Dumas strengthened the company's hold on its suppliers, resulting in Hermès's gaining great stakes in prominent French glassware, silverware acquiring venerable tableware manufacturers such as Puiforcat, St. Louis, and Périgord.\n\nFrom the 1980s, tableware became a strong segment of the firm. And, overall, the collection of Hermès goods expanded in 1990 to include over 30,000 pieces. New materials used in the collection included porcelain and crystal.\n\nHermès relocated its workshops and design studios to Pantin, just outside Paris. By June 1993 Hermès had gone public on the Paris Bourse (stock exchange). At the time, the equity sale generated great excitement. The 425,000 shares floated at FFr 300 (US$55 at the time) were oversubscribed by 34 times. Dumas told \"Forbes magazine\" that the equity sale would help lessen family tensions by allowing some members to liquidate their holdings without \"squabbling over share valuations among themselves.\"\n\nTo this time, the Hermès family was still retaining a strong hold of about 80% in stocks, placing Jean-Louis Dumas and the entire family on the \"Forbes\" list of billionaires. Mimi Tompkins of \"U.S. News & World Report\" called the company \"one of Paris' best guarded jewels.\"\n\nIn the following years, Dumas decreased Hermès franchises from 250 to 200 and increased company-owned stores from 60 to 100 to better control sales of its products. The plan was to cost about FFr 200 million in the short term but to increase profits in the long term. Having around FFr 500 million to invest, Hermès pressed ahead, targeting China for company-operated boutiques, finally opening a store in Beijing in 1996.\n\nIn 1997, Jean-Louis hired iconoclastic Belgian designer Martin Margiela to supervise women's ready-to-wear.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Hermès continued extensively to diminish the number of franchised stores, buying them up and opening more company-operated boutiques. The fashion industry was caught off guard in September 1999, when Jean-Louis decided to pay FFr 150 million for a 35% stake in the Jean-Paul Gaultier fashion house. In the latter part of the 1900s, the company encouraged its clientele to \"faites nous rêver\" (make us dream), producing throughout the period artistically atypical orders.\n\nIn 2003, Margiela left Hermès, and highly controversial Jean-Paul Gaultier, as the head designer, debuted his first ready-to-wear collection for fall/winter 2004–05.\n\nAfter 28 years as head of the firm, Jean-Louis Dumas retired in January 2006. Known for his charm and one of Europe's greatest authorities on luxury, he died in 2010 after a long illness. Patrick Thomas, who had joined the company in 1989 and who had worked with Jean-Louis as the co-CEO from 2005, replaced him. Thomas became the first non-Hermès family member to head the company.\n\nIn February 2015, Hermès has announced an increase of its turnover of 9.7%, which represents more than €4 billion in sales.\n\nThis increase is internationally visible. In Asia, excluding Japan, where the turnover grew 7%, in America, with 10% rise, in Europe where it grew 7% growth and generated a good performance in the group's stores.\n\nIn March 2018, Hermès opened its largest, multi-storey shop, in middle east, at The Dubai Mall.\n\nOn 17 May 2018, Malaysian police seized 284 luxury bags, believed to be some Hermès handbags from the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dato' Seri Najib Razak's-linked apartments.\n\nIn 2019, the brand was ranked 33rd in the Forbes List \"World's Most Valuable Brands\".\n\nThe designers throughout the company's history have included Lola Prusac, Jacques Delahaye, Catherine de Karolyi, Monsieur Levaillant, Nicole de Vesian, Eric Bergère, Claude Brouet, Tan Giudicelli, Marc Audibet, Mariot Chane, Bernard Sanz, Martin Margiela, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Christophe Lemaire, Véronique Nichanian (the men's-wear designer since 1988), and Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski (since 2014 succeeding Lemaire).\n\nKnown for luxury goods, by 2008, Hermès had 14 product divisions that encompassed leather, scarves, ties, men's and women's wear, perfume, watches, stationery, footwear, gloves, enamelware, decorative arts, tableware, and jewellery.\n\nHermès sales compose about 30% leather goods, 15% clothes, 12% scarves, and 43% other wares. The company licenses no products and keeps tight control over the design and manufacture of its vast inventory.\n\nThe firm is very attached to its traditional business model and rejects mass production, assembly lines, and mechanization. Hermès's goods are almost entirely made in France by hand in middle-sized workshops known as Les Ateliers Hermès that emphase high-quality manufacturing. Indeed, Hermès claims most items are fabricated from beginning to end by only one person, which is supposed to guarantee the quality and uniqueness of its products.\n\nIn 2012, Hermès retail outlets changed their policy regarding returns and exchanges of products. Consumers may only exchange items within ten days of purchase and only for another color variant of the original purchase. No other post-purchase exchanges are permitted, and refunds are never offered, regardless of the consumer's having a receipt.\n\nThe scarf or \"carré\" (square) was introduced in 1937. The first example was a 70 cm x 70 cm print of white-wigged females playing a popular period game, a custom-made accessory named \"Jeu des Omnibus et Dames Blanches.\" Hermès oversaw the production of its scarves throughout the entire process, purchasing raw Chinese silk, spinning it into yarn, and weaving it into fabric twice as strong and heavy as most scarves available at the time.\n\nThe company's scarf designers spend years creating new print patterns that are individually screen-printed. Designers can choose from over 70,000 different colors. When production first began, a dedicated factory was established in Lyon, France, the same year that Hermès celebrated its 100th anniversary.\n\nContemporary Hermès \"carrés\" measure 90 cm × 90 cm, weigh 65 grams and are woven from the silk of 250 mulberry moth cocoons. All hems are hand-stitched. Motifs are wide-ranging, Two silk-scarf collections per year are released, along with some reprints of older designs and limited editions. And two collections per year are introduced in a Cashmere/silk blend. Since 1937, Hermès has produced over 2,000 unique designs; the horse motif is particularly famous and popular. The ubiquitous \"Brides de Gala\" version, introduced in 1957, has been produced more than 70,000 times. An Hermès scarf is sold somewhere in the world every 25 seconds; by the late 1970s, more than 1.1 million scarves had been sold worldwide.\n\nThe scarves have been worn by an array of celebrities, partially such as:\n\nIn 1946, the brand introduced a range of men's silk neckties in an array of motifs and widths. Neckties account for 10% of the company's annual sales.\n\nFor years, Hermès has partnered with Tuareg tribesmen for silver jewelry. The Saharan nomads' traditional motifs are often mirrored in various Hermès products, including scarves.\n\nHermès is known for its handmade luggage and handbags. One of them might require 18 to 24 hours to produce. The construction of each Kelly bag, for example, requires 18 hours to fully realize. Hermès's leathers come from all over the world. Customers may currently wait from six months to one year for delivery of one of the house's signature bags. Incidentally, should Hermès's leather goods require repair, owners can bring an item to any Hermès store, where it will be shipped to Les Ateliers Hermès in Pantin for repair or reconditioning.\n\nAnother famous Hermès handbag, the \"Birkin\", was named after English actress Jane Birkin. In a chance encounter with Jean-Louis Dumas, she complained that her bag was not practical for everyday use. Consequently, he invited her to France where they co-designed the bag in 1984. Birkin has since stopped carrying her namesake bag due to her tendonitis, as the bag became too large and heavy for her to carry. Asked by her that her name be removed and with much back-and-forth comments about various issues such as having her name removed. According to \"Vogue\": \"Jane Birkin 'is satisfied by the measures taken by Hermès', according to the brand, following an investigation by the fashion house [that refuted] claims made by PETA [the animal-rights organization] that its famous Birkin bags were being 'constructed from the skins of factory-farmed and cruelly slaughtered crocodiles.' \"\n\nSince 1951, the company has created a number of scents for both men and women, as well as unisex lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelonging to the group is the crystal glass manufacturer Saint-Louis, the oldest crystal company in the world. Since its founding in 1586, Saint-Louis has drawn design inspiration from the decorative periods of the 19th and 20th centuries, from the Restoration to Modern styles, through Napoléon III, Art Nouveau and Art Déco. Saint-Louis became one of the Hermès Group Métiers in 1989.\n\nIn 2015, Hermès partnered with Apple Inc. to produce the Apple Watch Hermès, combining Apple's smartwatch with Hermès's specially crafted single tour, double tour, and cuff watch bands.\n\nThe Hermès Foundation was launched in 2008. It is chaired by Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the artistic director of Hermés, and directed by Catherine Tsekenis.\n\nThe Foundation embodies the group's goal to sponsor and support creation and craftsmanship activities.\n\nIn 2010, it launched the biannual Emile Hermès Prize that rewards an innovative project in the field of design. In 2014, the three winners who shared the first prize, chaired by Italian architect Michele De Lucchi, were Johan Brunel and Samuel Misslen for their \"Ventilated Capsule,\" Antoine Lesur and Marc Venot for \"Hut,\" and Paul Tubiana for \"Leon.\" In 2012, the Foundation participated in the \"New Settings\" show for the promotion of the arts. In 2013, the Foundation supported the exhibition of works by young artists shown at the Palace of Tokyo. In January 2014, it has pledged a three-year support of the Cité internationale of Aubusson tapestry.\n\nBy 31 December 2016, the Hermès family, as partners of Émile Hermès SARL and their family members, collectively owned 65.1% of the share capital of Hermès International S.A. through a number of asset holding companies and direct ownerships, which entitled the family to 74.8% of the voting rights on allocation of net income and 77.2% on all other matters. Luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH held 20.21% of shares (amassed in the latter half of 2010) and 13.08% of votes at the same date, with 0.39% of shares held as treasury stock and the remaining 16.61% as free float. Speculation that LVMH would launch a takeover bid for Hermès has been repeatedly denied by its chairman Bernard Arnault. Some industry insiders have been in doubt, such as René Weber, an analyst at Zürich's Vontobel Investment Banking, who has claimed: \"Arnault is not afraid of a fight and a lot of his battles have been successful for him and his shareholders. Whether he can eventually succeed with [a takeover of] Hermès is still an open question.\" Bertrand Puech, who chairs the main Hermès family holding company, has criticised LVMH's acquisition of Hermès shares and called on the company to reduce its stake by half.\n\n\n"}

The mummies, particularly the early ones, are frequently associated with the presence of the Indo-European Tocharian languages in the Tarim Basin, although the evidence is not totally conclusive and many centuries separate these mummies from the first attestation of the Tocharian languages in writing. Victor H. Mair's team concluded that the mummies are Caucasoid, likely speakers of Indo-European languages such as the Tocharians.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, European explorers such as Sven Hedin, Albert von Le Coq and Sir Aurel Stein all recounted their discoveries of desiccated bodies in their search for antiquities in Central Asia. Since then, numerous other mummies have been found and analyzed, many of them now displayed in the museums of Xinjiang. Most of these mummies were found on the eastern end of the Tarim Basin (around the area of Lopnur, Subeshi near Turpan, Loulan, Kumul), or along the southern edge of the Tarim Basin (Khotan, Niya, and Cherchen or Qiemo).\n\nThe earliest Tarim mummies, found at Qäwrighul and dated to 1800 BCE, are of a Caucasian physical type whose closest affiliation is to the Bronze Age populations of southern Siberia, Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and the Lower Volga.\n\nThe cemetery at Yanbulaq contained 29 mummies which date from 1100–500 BCE, 21 of which are Mongoloid—the earliest Mongoloid mummies found in the Tarim Basin—and eight of which are of the same Caucasian physical type found at Qäwrighul.\n\nNotable mummies are the tall, red-haired \"Chärchän man\" or the \"Ur-David\" (1000 BCE); his son (1000 BCE), a small 1-year-old baby with brown hair protruding from under a red and blue felt cap, with two stones positioned over its eyes; the \"Hami Mummy\" (\"c.\" 1400–800 BCE), a \"red-headed beauty\" found in Qizilchoqa; and the \"Witches of Subeshi\" (4th or 3rd century BCE), who wore black felt conical hats with a flat brim. Also found at Subeshi was a man with traces of a surgical operation on his abdomen; the incision is sewn up with sutures made of horsehair.\nMany of the mummies have been found in very good condition, owing to the dryness of the desert and the desiccation it produced in the corpses. The mummies share many typical Caucasian body features (elongated bodies, angular faces, recessed eyes), and many of them have their hair physically intact, ranging in color from blond to red to deep brown, and generally long, curly and braided. Their costumes, and especially textiles, may indicate a common origin with Indo-European neolithic clothing techniques or a common low-level textile technology. Chärchän man wore a red twill tunic and tartan leggings. Textile expert Elizabeth Wayland Barber, who examined the tartan-style cloth, discusses similarities between it and fragments recovered from salt mines associated with the Hallstatt culture. As a result of the arid conditions and exceptional preservation, tattoos have been identified on mummies from several sites around the Tarim Basin, including Qäwrighul, Yanghai, Shengjindian, Shanpula (Sampul), Zaghunluq, and Qizilchoqa.\n\nIt has been asserted that the textiles found with the mummies are of an early European textile type based on close similarities to fragmentary textiles found in salt mines in Austria, dating from the second millennium BCE. Anthropologist Irene Good, a specialist in early Eurasian textiles, noted the woven diagonal twill pattern indicated the use of a rather sophisticated loom and said that the textile is \"the easternmost known example of this kind of weaving technique.\"\n\nA 2008 study by Jilin University showed that the Yuansha population has relatively close relationships with the modern populations of South Central Asia and Indus Valley, as well as with the ancient population of Chawuhu.\n\nIn 2007 the Chinese government allowed a National Geographic Society team headed by Spencer Wells to examine the mummies' DNA. Wells was able to extract undegraded DNA from the internal tissues. The scientists extracted enough material to suggest the Tarim Basin was continually inhabited from 2000 BCE to 300 BCE and preliminary results indicate the people, rather than having a single origin, originated from Europe, Mesopotamia, Indus Valley and other regions yet to be determined.\n\nBetween 2009–2015, the remains of 92 individuals found at the Xiaohe Tomb complex were analyzed for Y-DNA and mtDNA markers. Genetic analyses of the mummies showed that the maternal lineages of the Xiaohe people originated from both East Asia and West Eurasia, whereas the paternal lineages all originated from West Eurasia.\n\nMitochondrial DNA analysis showed that maternal lineages carried by the people at Xiaohe included mtDNA haplogroups H, K, U5, U7, U2e, T and R*, which are now most common in West Eurasia. Also found were haplogroups common in modern populations from East Asia: B5, D and G2a. Haplogroups now common in Central Asian or Siberian populations included: C4 and C5. Haplogroups later regarded as typically South Asian included M5 and M*.\n\nOf the paternal lines of male remains surveyed nearly all – 11 out of 12, or around 92% – belonged to Y-DNA haplogroup R1a1, which are now most common in West Eurasia; the other belonged to the exceptionally rare paragroup K* (M9). The R1a1 lineage suggests a proximity of this population with groups related to the Andronovo culture, i.e. early Indo-Europeans.\n\nThe geographic location of this admixing is unknown, although south Siberia is likely.\n\nMair claims that \"the earliest mummies in the Tarim Basin were exclusively Caucasoid, or Europoid\" with east Asian migrants arriving in the eastern portions of the Tarim Basin around 3,000 years ago while the Uyghur peoples arrived around the year 842. In trying to trace the origins of these populations, Victor Mair's team suggested that they may have arrived in the region by way of the Pamir Mountains about 5,000 years ago.\n\nMair has claimed that:\n\nChinese historian Ji Xianlin says China \"supported and admired\" research by foreign experts into the mummies. \"However, within China a small group of ethnic separatists have taken advantage of this opportunity to stir up trouble and are acting like buffoons. Some of them have even styled themselves the descendants of these ancient 'white people' with the aim of dividing the motherland. But these perverse acts will not succeed.\" Barber addresses these claims by noting that \" is scarcely closer to 'Turkic' in her anthropological type than she is to Han Chinese. The body and facial forms associated with Turks and Mongols began to appear in the Tarim cemeteries only in the first millennium BCE, fifteen hundred years after this woman lived.\" Due to the \"fear of fuelling separatist currents\", the Xinjiang museum, regardless of dating, displays all their mummies, both Tarim and Han, together.\n\nPhysical anthropologists propose the movement of at least two Caucasian physical types into the Tarim Basin. Mallory and Mair associate these types with the Tocharian and Iranian (Saka) branches of the Indo-European language family, respectively. However, archaeology and linguistics professor Elizabeth Wayland Barber cautions against assuming the mummies spoke Tocharian, noting a gap of about a thousand years between the mummies and the documented Tocharians: \"people can change their language at will, without altering a single gene or freckle.\"\n\nB. E. Hemphill's biodistance analysis of cranial metrics (as cited in and ) has questioned the identification of the Tarim Basin population as European, noting that the earlier population has close affinities to the Indus Valley population, and the later population with the Oxus River valley population. Because craniometry can produce results which make no sense at all (e.g. the close relationship between Neolithic populations in Ukraine and Portugal) and therefore lack any historical meaning, any putative genetic relationship must be consistent with geographical plausibility and have the support of other evidence.\n\nHan Kangxin, who examined the skulls of 302 mummies, found the closest relatives of the earlier Tarim Basin population in the populations of the Afanasevo culture situated immediately north of the Tarim Basin and the Andronovo culture that spanned Kazakhstan and reached southwards into West Central Asia and the Altai.\n\nIt is the Afanasevo culture to which trace the earliest Bronze Age settlers of the Tarim and Turpan basins. The Afanasevo culture (\"c.\" 3500–2500 BCE) displays cultural and genetic connections with the Indo-European-associated cultures of the Eurasian Steppe yet predates the specifically Indo-Iranian-associated Andronovo culture (\"c.\" 2000–900 BCE) enough to isolate the Tocharian languages from Indo-Iranian linguistic innovations like satemization.\n\nMallory and Mair associate this later (700 BCE–200 CE) Caucasian physical type with the populations who introduced the Iranian Saka language to the western part of the Tarim basin.\nFrom Libby Rosof (1997) \"\"Penn Researcher Finds Chinese Mummies’ Surprising Roots\"\":\n"}

It is located in the Gothic Revival former Canterbury College (now the University of Canterbury), Christchurch Boys' High School and Christchurch Girls' High School buildings, many of which were designed by Benjamin Mountfort. The centre is a national landmark and taonga as it is home to New Zealand's largest collection of category one heritage buildings with 21 of the 23 buildings covered by Heritage New Zealand listings.\n\nThe centre, which is held in trust for the people of Canterbury and its visitors, has been undergoing a large restoration since it was badly damaged in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Buildings are progressively reopening to the public as they are strengthened and repaired and more than two-thirds of the buildings have reopened.\n\nThe Arts Centre Te Matatiki Toi Ora comprises 22 heritage buildings. The Student Union building was registered on 26 November 1981 and is a Category II entry. All buildings on the western half of the centre were registered as heritage buildings by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust on 15 February 1990 with registration number 7301 classified as A and B. With the change of the classification system, the buildings later became a Category I listing. The Registry Building in the northeast corner of the site was registered on 13 February 1997 and is a Category I listing.\n\nThe buildings are also listed in the Christchurch City Plan as heritage items. In the previous plan, 20 buildings were listed as Group 1 or 2, and three buildings were listed as Group 3. There are just two modern buildings on the site, with the Registry Additions built in 1957 and extended in 1967 and not listed under the old city plan, although it was proposed by the Christchurch City Council to include it in the listing with the historic registry building.\n\nThe restored Arts Centre Te Matatiki Toi Ora buildings are home to museums, including Rutherford's Den, where the father of nuclear physics Ernest, Lord Rutherford studied while at Canterbury College and the University of Canterbury's Teece Museum of Classical Antiquities, as well as boutique art galleries, eateries, retailers and offices.\n\nThe centre also hosts many special arts and cultural events, including a weekly market, and it has beautiful buildings and rooms available to hire.\n\nBefore the 2011 earthquake The Court Theatre, a professional theatre company, was based at The Arts Centre from 1976 until 2010.\n\nThe Twelve Local Heroes is a series of bronze busts located on Worcester Boulevard outside The Arts Centre to commemorate twelve local Christchurch people who were prominent in their respective fields in the latter part of the 20th century. They are currently unavailable as the building adjacent to it is awaiting restoration.\n\nThe Arts Centre of Christchurch Incorporated was created in 1974, when the University of Canterbury completed its move to its new Ilam campus, and ownership of the site was transferred in 1978.\n\nThe Arts Centre Te Matatiki Toi Ora is governed by a charitable trust board. It relies solely on donations as it receives no ongoing funding from central or local governments. Its chief executive is Philip Aldridge, who took over the role in mid-2018 after the departure of André Lovatt.\n\nIn 2009 strong debate emerged over a proposal to use The Arts Centre Te Matatiki Toi Ora car park located off Hereford Street for the University of Canterbury's School of Music. Proponents valued the additional vibrancy that this would bring into the Cultural Precinct, and supported the university moving back to their original site. Opponents felt that the proposed building was out of scale with the existing Arts Centre and that the building design would detract from the heritage value. Ultimately the proposal was abandoned after a successful campaign by Save our Arts Centre, a group led by Richard Sinke.\n\nIn May 2017, the university opened two departments in the restored old Chemistry building – the classics and music school. Some 400 students transfer from the Ilam campus to the central city facility.\n\nIn the early hours of 4 September 2010, a major earthquake caused extensive damage throughout the Canterbury region. The Arts Centre Te Matatiki Toi Ora buildings were damaged – collapsing chimneys damaged the Great Hall, the Observatory Tower and the Clock Tower. The then Arts Centre director Ken Franklin commented that prior measures taken to reinforce the buildings may have prevented additional damage. The buildings had been insured for NZ$95 million, and this was increased to NZ$120m in January 2011.\n\nThe Arts Centre Te Matatiki Toi Ora was very badly damaged in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, but no people were hurt at the centre. All historic buildings became inaccessible to the public and the entire complex was closed until the first restored and strengthened building, Registry, reopened in 2013.\n\nIt was initially estimated the cost to repair The Arts Centre Te Matatiki Toi Ora would be NZ$100m. This was later revised to more than NZ$200m and estimated to take 15 years to accomplish. In July 2012, it was announced that André Lovatt had been secured as its new chief executive, tasking him with the restoration project; Lovatt started in October 2012. Under Lovatt's guidance, the programme was accelerated although with the scope becoming better known, the costs escalated to NZ$290m making it one of the largest heritage restoration projects in the world.\n\nThe massive restoration programme immaculately restores and strengthens the heritage features of the centre's unique heritage buildings, while fitting them out with the latest modern facilities. With more than two-thirds of the centre open again, it is home to museums, art galleries, boutique eateries and retailers, offices, arts and cultural events, a weekly market and venues for hire.\n\nWhile a significant amount of the restoration has been paid for, there is still a substantial shortfall in funds to complete it and the charitable trust is actively fundraising with the next stage to include the $10m restoration of the Observatory Tower and the restoration of the Physics, Biology and Engineering buildings. The Physics and Biology buildings will become home to a boutique hotel.\n\nThe first buildings to reopen after the earthquake were Registry, Registry Additions and The Gym with Registry reopening in July 2013. The Great Hall opened in June 2016.\n\n"}

NCS train #120 is also shown on the timetable as it makes stops at Libertyville and Lake Forest. Metra operates a reduced schedule on weekends. This service is supplemented by Amtrak, whose \"Empire Builder\" and \"Hiawatha Service\" inter-city trains stop at Union Station and Glenview.\nMetra began increased reverse-commute service on the North Line on March 4, 2019. This service is part of a pilot-program funded under a two-year, public-private partnership (P3).\n\nBefore the 1970s, this line was the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road). With the demise of the Milwaukee Road, ownership eventually passed to Metra. Today this service is one of several Metra routes operated by Metra crews, but trains are dispatched, under contract, by the Canadian Pacific Railway, which bought the Milwaukee Road in 1986 along with the Soo Line in 1990 and runs freight service over parts of this route.\n\nThe Milwaukee District/North Line route and Metra's track ownership diverges from the Chicago - Milwaukee - Minneapolis mainline at Rondout, Illinois and proceeds northwesterly toward Fox Lake. This secondary route, owned by Metra, was known as the Janesville Subdivision (J-Sub) of the Milwaukee Road. The mainline north of Rondout is owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and sees Amtrak and freight traffic only. Metra service and track ownership ends at Fox Lake. The tracks beyond Fox Lake are owned by the State of Wisconsin and operated for freight service by the Wisconsin and Southern Railroad. Commuter service beyond Fox Lake, abolished in 1982, served the communities of Spring Grove, Illinois, Solon Mills, Illinois, Zenda, Wisconsin, and Walworth, Wisconsin. \n\nUntil 1984, there was a stop in Rondout. The station building itself was demolished in the mid-1960s. The station was located at Rondout Junction, where the line crosses the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway's tracks at a diamond junction.\n\nThere is also talk of constructing a second branch, running along the Canadian Pacific main line from Rondout north to Wadsworth and Kenosha County, Wisconsin.\n\nSince 2014 annual ridership has declined from 7.2 million to 6.6 million, an overall decline of 8.7%.\n\n"}

He has appeared in several American films, making his debut in \"Bee Season\" (2005) before starring in \"Art School Confidential\" (2006), \"The Social Network\" (2010) and \"The Internship\" (2013). Minghella currently stars as Nick Blaine in the Hulu drama series \"The Handmaid's Tale\".\n\nMinghella was born in Hampstead, London, the son of director Anthony Minghella (1954–2008) and dancer and choreographer Carolyn Jane Choa. His father was born in Ryde, Isle of Wight, and was of Italian descent, and his mother was born in Hong Kong. His maternal grandfather was of three-quarters Han Chinese and one-quarter Jewish descent, and his maternal grandmother was of Chinese, English, Irish, Parsi, and Swedish ancestry. His maternal great-grandfather was Hong Kong legislator Sir Robert Kotewall, and his maternal great-great-grandfather was Calcutta-born businessman Emanuel Raphael Belilios.\n\nMinghella spent time on his father's film sets while growing up, of which he has \"fond memories\" and has said that he felt \"no pressure\" by his father to succeed in the entertainment industry. He was educated at St Anthony's Preparatory School and University College School in Hampstead. He then attended Columbia University, which he considered his \"first priority\", and studied history, graduating in 2009. He typically worked on films only during his summer break. He said that he felt like \"an English boy at an American school\", that he kept to himself, and that most of his fellow students did not know that he was an actor.\n\nMinghella was inspired to become an actor during his late teenage years, after seeing a production of the play \"This Is Our Youth\" in London's West End; he subsequently dropped out of the University College School to pursue an acting career, and attended the National Youth Theatre. He did not always want to become an actor. He said: \"I thought it was sort of embarrassing to say you wanted to be an actor it was, like, uncool. And growing up I was massively concerned with seeming cool. I thought up until about age 16 that I was going to be a music video director.\"\n\nMinghella had an uncredited appearance as an extra in his father's film \"Cold Mountain\". His first professional role was in \"Bee Season\", playing the son of a dysfunctional Jewish American family. The film was released in November 2005 to mostly mixed reviews and low box office, grossing only $1 million in its limited release, although critics remarked that Minghella was \"a talented young actor to watch, delivering a strong performance\".\n\nMinghella's other November 2005 role was the political thriller \"Syriana\" in which he played the son of George Clooney's CIA agent character. In 2006, he starred in the Daniel Clowes adaptation \"Art School Confidential\", a comedy directed by Terry Zwigoff. He got the part after meeting Zwigoff when he visited the set of \"Bee Season\". His film \"Elvis and Anabelle\", a dark romantic drama in which he plays an undertaker's son, premiered at the South by Southwest film festival in 2007. He described it as \"a really sweet film\". He was to play Art Bechstein in the film version of writer Michael Chabon's novel \"The Mysteries of Pittsburgh\", but dropped out of the project due to his university schedule.\n\nThe press reported in 2007 that Minghella was cast in Beeban Kidron's \"Hippie Hippie Shake\", a film about writer Richard Neville set in 1960s London. In March 2008, it was announced that he would star in Alejandro Amenábar's second English language film, \"Agora\". The film is set in 4th century Egypt and revolves around Hypatia of Alexandria. Later in 2008, Minghella played a pompous film director in \"How to Lose Friends & Alienate People\", and was seen in a segment of the dark comedy \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men\".\n\nIn David Fincher's \"The Social Network\", the 2010 film about the origins of Facebook, he plays Divya Narendra, one of the Harvard upperclassmen who sues Mark Zuckerberg for stealing the idea behind Facebook. In June 2010, Minghella was cast in the Russian science-fiction film \"The Darkest Hour\", released in December 2011. He appeared in the ensemble dramedy \"10 Years\" (2012). The following year, he had a supporting role as Graham Hawtrey in the comedy \"The Internship\".\n\nIn November 2013, it was announced that Minghella would be playing Richie Castellano in the second season of the Fox sitcom \"The Mindy Project\".

In retaliation for Forrest’s raid on Fort Pillow, north of Memphis, Union General Andrew Jackson (Whiskey) Smith, with a large military force, arrived in Oxford, MS on August 24, 1864, and in one day burned the Lafayette County Courthouse, all the business houses on the Square, except one, and all homes in the immediate area.\n\nSmith was born in rural Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1838 ranking 36th in a class of 45 graduates. He entered West Point with his kin Langdon C. Easton of St. Louis, who was Chief Quartermaster of General William T. Sherman's 100,000-man army. Smith was engaged on active service on the frontier in the Southwest and in the Mexican–American War, in the latter briefly commanding the Mormon Battalion. He later fought against Native Americans in the Washington and Oregon territories. He was successively promoted to first lieutenant in 1845, captain in 1847, and major in early 1861.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War, Smith became a colonel of the 2nd California Volunteer Cavalry in the Union Army, rising early in 1862 to the rank of brigadier general in the United States Volunteers and to the chief command of the cavalry in the Department of the Missouri. From March through July, he served in the same capacity in the Department of the Mississippi. Assigned afterwards to the Army of the Tennessee, he took part in the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou and the capture of Arkansas Post. He commanded a division of the XIII Corps in the Vicksburg Campaign. Later, he led a division of the XVI Corps in the Red River Campaign of Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks. He received the brevet rank of colonel in the regular army for his services at the action of Pleasant Hill.\n\nIn July 1864, Smith became a lieutenant colonel in the regular army, to rank from May April 10, 1864. On May 14, 1864 President Abraham Lincoln appointed Smith a major general in the volunteers, to rank from May 12, 1864, the date of the United States Senate's confirmation of President Lincoln's May 9, 1864 nomination of Smith for the appointment.\n\nOn July 14-15, 1864, Smith defeated Confederate Lt.

During the autumn of 1864, Smith lead Union troops against Confederate Maj. Gen. Sterling Price during Price's Raid into Missouri. Smith was then summoned to join forces with Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas at Nashville, Tennessee, then threatened by the advance of Confederate Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood. Smith bore a conspicuous share in the crowning victory at the Battle of Nashville leading his troops past the Confederates' south flank. He commanded the XVI corps in the final campaign against Mobile, Alabama, in 1865.\n\nOn April 10, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Smith for appointment to the grade of brigadier general in the United States Army (Regular Army), to rank from March 13, 1865, for his services at the Battle of Tupelo and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on May 4, 1866.

It has an area of and an urban area that covers .\n\nTara is in the federal electoral district of Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound and in the provincial electoral district of the same name.\n\nTara Siding is just to the south of the community on the right (opposite) bank of the Sauble River. It was created in 1855 by the building of the Stratford and Huron Railway (later Grand Trunk Railway; later Canadian National Railway Owen Sound Subdivision; abandoned 1993).\n\nRichard Berford and John Hamilton were the first European settlers to move onto and survey the lots of the future village of Tara in 1851. The opening of the road from Southampton to Owen Sound in 1852 helped the early growth of the community, as the village is located approximately half-way in between the two larger towns. Shortly after, Hamilton opened a hotel, serving the incoming settlers of the surrounding townships. A post-office opened in 1862 with the name, Eblana, however it was changed the following year to Tara, after a town in County Meath, Ireland which served as the seat of Irish royalty. In 1880, the local newspaper, \"The Tara Leader\" was first published, and the following year the railroad was built to the community and the first locomotive arrived.\n\nIn 1855, a sawmill opened by H. W. M. Richards, becoming the first \"manufacturing industry\"; a grist mill was added to it in 1857. Two years later, a large foundry and agricultural implement works was started by W. A. Gerolamy. Other earlier businesses included a steam sawmill, a woolen mill and a potash factory. The first post office opened in 1862. The railway reached Tara in October 1881. The village never did become a major manufacturing centre.\n\nThe Government of Ontario has erected a historic plaque in Tara, offering a glimpse into the past of this area. The plaque titled THE FOUNDING OF TARA reads as follows. \"Soon after the survey of Arran Township was completed in 1851. John Hamilton and Richard Berford, early settlers in the area, located here along the Sauble River. The opening of the Owen Sound Post road stimulated the growth of a small community and in 1858 Berford registered a village plan. Situated in a rich agricultural region wuth abundant water power, the settlement developed quickly. By 1861 it contained saw and grist mills, a foundry producing agricultural implements, wagon works and a tannery, and the following year a post office was established.

His exceptional skating ability and irrepressible energy drew widespread attention to \"Whirlwind\" (later \"Cyclone\") Taylor and in 1905, in Michigan, he entered the International League, hockey's first professional organization. Having joined the Canadian civil service in 1907, he continued to play with Ottawa and Renfrew teams, and soon confirmed his reputation as a brilliant all-round player. He concluded his celebrated hockey career with the Vancouver Millionaires, 1912–20, of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. In 1946 he received the Order of the British Empire for his service to the immigration department. \"Cyclone\" Taylor was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1947.\"\n\nThe second plaque refers to a prominent lawyer. \"SIR WILLIAM H. HEARST 1864 - 1941. Born in Arran Township, Hearst was educated at the Collingwood Collegiate and Osgoode Hall. He practised law at Sault Ste. Marie and was first elected to the provincial legislature as Conservative member for that community in 1908. He was appointed minister of lands, forests and mines in 1911 during the administration of Sir James Whitney, and following the latter's death in September, 1914, became Ontario's seventh prime minister. Hearst retained that post throughout the first World War and was knighted for his services. Following his government's defeat in 1919 by the United Farmers of Ontario, he retired from politics, but served as a member of the International Joint Commission on Boundary Waters, 1920-40.\"\n\nA more recent notable former resident - Jeff Sprung now known as \"Jeff Kelly\" - is a radio personality currently residing in London working for 97.5 Virgin Radio as the afternoon drive show host weekdays 2-6 pm.

After leaving school, he became an arranger for such big bands as those of Stan Kenton, Vincent Lopez, and Johnny Richards.\n\nHe was a very prolific songwriter during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, with many of his songs attaining high rankings on the charts. Although he worked with many collaborators, the largest proportion of his well-known songs were written with Bennie Benjamin.\n\nWeiss contributed to a number of film scores: \"Murder, Inc.\" (1960), \"Gidget Goes to Rome\" (1963), \"Mediterranean Holiday\" (1964), and \"Mademoiselle\" (1966).\n\nCollaborations on three Broadway musicals were among his compositions. \"Mr. Wonderful\" was written in 1956 with Jerry Bock and Larry Holofcener. The Broadway production starred Sammy Davis, Jr. \"First Impressions\" was based on Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice.\" It was written in 1959, with Bo Goldman and Glenn Paxton. \"Maggie Flynn\" was written in 1968, with Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore. It was set in New York during the American Civil War, and the Broadway production starred Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy. In addition, Weiss and Will Severin composed the family musical, \"A Tale of Cinderella,\" which was first presented in December 1994 at the Theater Institute in Troy, New York, and filmed for presentation on PBS.\n\nWeiss wrote the lyrics for the Jazz standard \"Lullaby of Birdland\", which became a huge hit for Ella Fitzgerald. In 1984 Weiss was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2006 a court settlement was reached regarding royalties for the worldwide rights of the song \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight,\" best known as a #1 hit for The Tokens, which was based on a 1939 song, \"Mbube\", by the South African musician, Solomon Linda.

He had particularly successful songwriting partnerships with Sol Marcus, with whom he wrote \"I Don't Want To Set The World On Fire\", \"When the Lights Go On Again (All Over the World)\", and \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\"; and with George David Weiss, with whom he wrote \"Oh! What It Seemed to Be\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\". Most of his songs were in the traditional pop idiom.\n\nBenjamin was born in Christiansted on the island of St. Croix, then part of the Danish West Indies, and later within the United States Virgin Islands. As his family did not have sufficient funds to allow him to train as a minister, he trained as a tailor and cabinetmaker before moving to New York City in 1927.\n\nHe studied banjo and guitar at Hy Smith's School of Music, developing a distinctive playing style, and began performing in dance bands. He played guitar and banjo with various orchestras at the Savoy Ballroom and the Cotton Club, and elsewhere, and toured with Olsen and Johnson. Although he wrote songs and attempted to sell them, he had little success until starting work at a music publishing firm, and forming a songwriting partnership in the mid-1930s with New York-born composer Sol Marcus (1912–1976). With Marcus, Eddie Durham and Eddie Seiler (1911–1952), he wrote \"I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fire\", which was first recorded in 1941 by Harlan Leonard and his Kansas City Rockers, and then more successfully by The Ink Spots, whose version reached number 4 on the pop chart, and Horace Heidt, whose recording rose to number 1. The song won \"Billboard\"'s \"Top Songwriter's Award\" for 1941. Benjamin, Marcus and Seiler then wrote a second number 1 hit, \"When the Lights Go On Again (All Over the World)\", recorded by Vaughn Monroe and associated in Britain with Vera Lynn.\nIn 1942, Benjamin enlisted in the US Army, and performed in and produced entertainment shows. After returning to civilian life, he joined with lyricist George David Weiss, and established a second successful songwriting partnership with him. The pair wrote some twenty hit songs over the next decade. Their early successes included \"Oh! What It Seemed to Be\", a 1946 hit for Frank Sinatra, Frankie Carle, and others; Perry Como's number 1 hit \"Surrender\"; and \"Rumors Are Flying\", a number 1 hit in 1946 for Frankie Carle and also a hit for the Andrews Sisters and others. They also wrote together for the Disney films \"Fun and Fancy Free\" and \"Melody Time\". Later hits written by Benjamin and Weiss included \"I Don't See Me In Your Eyes Any More\" (recorded by the Stardusters and Perry Como); \"I'll Never Be Free\" (a pop hit as a duet between Tennessee Ernie Ford and Kay Starr, and an R&B hit for both Dinah Washington and Louis Jordan); \"Can Anyone Explain? (No, No, No!)\" (The Ames Brothers); and \"These Things I Offer You\" (by Benjamin, Weiss, and Morty Levins, recorded by Sarah Vaughan). In 1952, Benjamin and Weiss wrote one of their most successful songs, \"Wheel of Fortune\", a number 1 hit for Kay Starr which sold over one million copies and provided the theme for a TV show.\n\nAlthough Benjamin and Weiss continued to work together, their hits became less frequent and their working partnership ended in 1955. Benjamin then began working again with Sol Marcus, and the pair wrote \"Lonely Man\", recorded by Elvis Presley; and several songs recorded by Nina Simone, including \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\". The song was co-credited to Benjamin, Marcus, and Gloria Caldwell, the wife of songwriter Horace Ott. It was recorded by Simone in 1964 and was later a hit for The Animals. \n\nHaving first established a publishing company with Perry Como in 1950, Benjamin became more active as a music publisher in the 1960s, and set up Benjamin Publishing in 1965 and Bennie Benjamin Music in 1968. He was actively involved in ASCAP, winning an award for \"I'll Never Be Free\" in 1979, and was on the Council of the American Guild of Authors and Composers. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984.\n\nIn later life, he became an active investor in the US Virgin Islands, and became a major stockholder in the West Indies Bank and Trust. He also became known for his charitable activities, particularly in health care in the Virgin Islands. \n\nHe died in New York City on May 2, 1989, after a long illness.\n\nHe was married to Martha Flores from 1944 until her death in 1983.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His father, a milliner, sent him to Hampstead's University College School. Already in the Territorial Army from the age of 16, he enlisted in the Royal Engineers as the war broke out. In 1941 he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery as a searchlight officer. After converting from Judaism to the Church of England, he married Gay, with whom he had been friends since their childhood, in 1943. Shortly after the wedding he volunteered for the Special Operations Executive, and began training in Peterborough before his first mission to France. Rubinstein is the great great grandfather of comedian Jolyon Rubinstein.\n\nHe led the Special Operations Executive Jedburgh team that was parachuted safely, despite ground fire, into Brittany on the night of 6 August 1944, bearing five million francs for the French Resistance.\n\nThe following weeks were spent with the SAS and the Forces Français de L'Interieur helping to land gliders loaded with arms and hiding in an oyster farm between operations. The mission was a success, and resulted in most of the region being cleared of German forces by the end of the month.\n\nThe Jeds returned to France on 15 September parachuting into eastern France close to the Swiss border, there to gather intelligence on enemy movements and to help repel the German troops.\n\nHe was mentioned in dispatches, and awarded the Croix de Guerre.\n\nIn December 1944, he and two colleagues were parachuted into northern Burma to gather intelligence on Japanese supply lines and to stoke the resistance movement among the local Kachins, who were sympathetic to the Allied forces.\n\nAgain it would be a successful mission, with the guerilla groups organised by Rubinstein taking a heavy toll on the enemy. He had similar success in an operation in April 100 miles to the east. The 200 guerilla fighters he raised carried out ambushes on Japanese troops and captured weaponry. After two months, he led his team south to Toungoo to join forces holding back the Japanese advance on Siam.\n\nAfter the war, in which he reached the rank of Major, Rubinstein stayed in the Territorial Army, transferring to the Parachute Regiment in 1950.\n\n"}
{"id": "2009366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009366", "title": "SouthWest Service", "text": "SouthWest Service\n\nThe Southwest Service (SWS) is a Metra commuter rail line, running southwest from Union Station in downtown Chicago, Illinois, to Manhattan, Illinois. Metra does not refer to its lines by color, but the timetable accents for the SouthWest Service line are \"Banner Blue,\" for the Wabash Railroad's \"Banner Blue\" passenger train. The trackage is owned by Metra north of a junction with the Belt Railway of Chicago at Loomis Boulevard, and is leased from Norfolk Southern Railway south of the junction (NS has trackage rights over Metra's portion).\n\nThe line south of the curve at the east end of the section aligned with 75th Street was built by the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway, which opened in 1880 to Chicago. That curve was a junction with the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad, of which the Wabash owned one-fifth, and used to reach Dearborn Station in downtown Chicago. Commuter service from Chicago began as early as 1893, with trains running as far south as Orland Park, and by 1909, the service had been extended with several trains operating as far south as Manhattan. The level of service deteriorated in the 1930s, with commuter operations effectively reduced to one train in each direction making local stops from Chicago to Decatur. By 1964, the once daily Chicago–Decatur trains were cut back to Orland Park.\n\nAfter several reorganizations the Wabash Railroad was leased by the Norfolk and Western Railway on October 16, 1964. The single round trip continued under the new ownership, who named the train the Orland Park Cannonball. On May 1, 1971, Amtrak assumed control of most intercity passenger trains in the United States. On this date all intercity services operating into and out of Chicago were either routed into Union Station or discontinued, leaving the single Orland Park Cannonball as the only train to still use Dearborn Station. Dearborn Station closed, but the commuter train continued to use a small platform and track on the property until 1976 when it relocated to Union Station, via a new connection at Alton Junction.\n\nThe Regional Transportation Authority began to subsidize the service in 1978. N&W merged with Southern Railway to form the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1982, and for the next decade the line was known as the Norfolk Southern Line (NS). The RTA closed the Western Avenue station on May 15, 1984, as part of a cost reduction plan which saw the closure of twelve other lightly used stations and the removal of ticket agents from an additional seventeen stations across the system. On June 1, 1993 Metra took over operations and renamed it the SouthWest Service.\n\nThe rail line expansion project, which includes of new track and at least two additional train stations, was completed (except for the Laraway Road station) in January 2006. The number of trains per day increased from 16 to 30, 15 in each direction. For years, Pace operated Route 835, whose bus service enhanced the limited train service in the SouthWest Service corridor. With the rail service expansion, ridership on route 835 became so poor that Pace eliminated it on August 17, 2007.\n\nMetra started Saturday service on March 21, 2009, with six trains between Union Station and Manhattan.\n\nSouthWest Service trains will shift from Union Station to LaSalle Street Station with the reconfiguration of the 75th Street Corridor under the auspices of the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE). This will happen no earlier than 2025 when construction is scheduled for completion. Additional mainline trackage will also be built between LaSalle St Station and 74th to handle the increase in traffic. LaSalle St Station will also be expanded. This would relieve congestion at Union Station and improve reliability for the SouthWest Service, as well as allowing more trains to run in each direction.\n\n, the last time Metra revised the timetable, the SouthWest Service has fifteen round-trips per day on weekdays and three on Saturday. There is no Sunday/holiday service. All Saturday trains run through to Manhattan. Of the weekday trains, one terminates at Orland Park 153rd Street, two at Manhattan, and the remainder at Orland Park 179th Street.\n\nFrom 2006 to early 2018, a third weekday train (a midday one) terminated at Manhattan. Due to lack of ridership as well as service cuts, this train became a short-turn to Orland Park 179th Street effective Spring 2018.\n\nThe Laraway Road and Manhattan stations see a combined ridership of under 60 people daily, making them two of the least-used stations on Metra's system.\n\nSince 2014 annual ridership has declined from 2.6 million to 2.4 million, an overall decline of 9%.\n\n"}

The party was registered with the Electoral Commission in 2005, although its registration has since lapsed.\n\nThe NA sought to build a closer alliance with other groups on the far right working outside the BNP and sought to negotiate a merger with the Freedom Party, although the proposed merger did not come to pass as Adrian Davies was reluctant to join up with some of the more extremist elements of the NA. Seeking to further their ties with other activists, the party held a meeting attended by members of the White Nationalist Party and National Front at Rawdon Conservative Club on 10 September 2005 as a memorial to John Tyndall, where they were addressed by Tyndall supporter and BNP member Richard Edmonds, NA party leader and ex-leader of the WNP Eddy Morrison, and John Wood, formerly a senior member of the WNP. The meeting was attacked, with windows being smashed.\n\nAlthough the meeting at Rawdon demonstrated the support that the NA was building up amongst far right activists, it also helped to bring about the group's destruction. A photograph of the membership at the meeting appeared in \"Searchlight\", leading to accusations being made about who was to blame for its appearance. Along with the failure of the Freedom Party initiative and general ideological clashes the unity within the NA did not last and in September 2005 Morrison, Wood and Watmough split to form the British Peoples Party.\n\nThe split led to recriminations across the far right, with Morrison attacked by Martin Webster, with whom Morrison was in dispute over which of them was the political heir of the late John Tyndall, with Webster accusing Morrison in his web bulletin of using the NA simply to swindle the members out of their money, a charge Morrison denied.\n\nDespite the split, the Nationalist Alliance continued to operate, offering a policy platform that was nativist, in favour of deportation, supportive of stronger punishments for criminals including capital punishment and in favour of white nationalism. Afterwards they sought, largely under the direction of former Burnley BNP activist Sharon Pastow, to continue their moves towards a wider alliance by working closely with the National Front and the England First Party (EFP), whilst also holding a largely dual membership with the Wolf's Hook White Brotherhood.\n\nIn November 2006 a leading member Mick \"Belsen\" Sanderson was murdered in Nottingham following a fight with another NA member. In September 2007 the member, John Pakulski, was sentenced to six years imprisonment for manslaughter whilst Catherine Parker-Brown received a community order for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after she was found to have cleaned the scene of the crime.\n\nParker-Brown, a former organiser for the BNP in the East Midlands, was the nominal leader of the NA, although their membership is largely interchangeable with the now more important EFP. The NA's sister group, the Wolf's Hook White Brotherhood, has ceased to exist, with most of its membership transferring to the Racial Volunteer Force. Beyond an internet presence and its occasional publication \"Axiom\" (previously the group had two publications, \"Vanguard\" and \"Imperium\", although these both switched to the BPP following the split) the party is largely defunct, with the group's entry in the Register of Political Parties lapsing in December 2008.\n\nThe name had been used 'in house' for an initiative driven by Andrew Brons to achieve a reconciliation and joint electoral action between the Flag Group and the BNP in 1986, a move which ultimately came to nothing. The current incarnation of the Nationalist Alliance has no connection to this proposal however.\n"}

Evidence has also been found of occupation during Roman times; the foundations of a villa were excavated in a field just north west of the castle in 1822.\n\nFrom 1985 to 2010 the village was the venue for the annual Trowbridge Village Pump Festival.\n\nThe manor was called Farleigh Montfort from just after the conquest when it was owned by a Norman family, the Montforts, until the fourteenth century. Then Reginald de Montfort sold the estate to one of Edward III’s soldiers whose family held it only for about a quarter of a century. In 1369 AD Sir Thomas de Hungerford bought the house from the childless daughter of the recently deceased squire, and the house later came to be known as Farleigh Hungerford. The parish of Farleigh Hungerford was part of the Wellow Hundred.\nIt is the location of Farleigh Hungerford Castle, built around 1370 and owned by English Heritage and the former home of Sir Thomas Hungerford, Speaker of the House of Commons. In the early 15th century, his son, Sir Walter Hungerford, enlarged the castle by adding the outer court that enclosed the parish church, St Leonard's, which he used as his chapel. It is thought that he built the present parish church nearby to replace it.\n\nIn the Civil War, Sir Edward Hungerford (1596-1648) commanded the Parliamentary forces of Wiltshire briefly. His half-brother, Col John Hungerford, was a Royalist and was given the command of the garrison of Farleigh in 1644. However he surrendered to Sir Edward without fighting in 1645. A later Sir Edward Hungerford (1632-1711), who had been MP for Chippenham during Richard Cromwell's brief reign, entertained Charles II of England at Farleigh in about 1675. After the discovery of the Rye House Plot in 1683, the castle was raided by the government and weapons were seized. The spendthrift Sir Edward was the last male of his family, but by the time of his death he had already sold the castle (in 1686) to Henry Bayntun for £56,000.\n\nEnclosed by a curtain wall with a cylindrical tower at each corner, the squarish inner bailey contained a selection of domestic buildings. Today only two of the towers and some sections of the curtain wall survive. The south west tower stands almost to its full height of five storeys in places, but the south east tower exists only a little more than its third floor. It is a grade I listed building.\n\nFarleigh House is a large country house, previously the centre of the Farleigh Hungerford estate, and has sometimes been called \"Farleigh New Castle\". The present building was started in the 18th century but is mainly an early 19th-century Gothic Revival building. In 2010 it was converted to be used as the offices and training centre of Bath Rugby.\n\nThe Anglican parish Church of St Leonard was consecrated in 1443, and remodelled in 1856. It was once within the outer walls of the castle but is now separated from it by the main road. The church, which is a grade II* listed building, has a perpendicular style West Tower in 3 stages, with a pair of stone gargoyles on each face. There are the remains of some 14th-century stained glass in the north window of the nave and in the east Chancel window which are of Flemish origin.\n\nThe church also contains a 17th-century wooden altar rail carved with open work scrolls and figures. The pulpit dates from the early 18th century and is carved with eagles and angels.\n\nThere is a spot on the river Frome which is used by what is claimed to be the only river swimming club still active in Britain.\n"}

The team competes as a member of UEFA in various international football tournaments such as the FIFA Women's World Cup, UEFA Women's Euro, the Summer Olympics, and the Algarve Cup.\n\nThe France women's national team initially struggled on the international stage failing to qualify for three of the first FIFA Women's World Cups and the six straight UEFA European Championships before reaching the quarter-finals in the 1997 edition of the competition. However, since the beginning of the new millennium, France have become one of the most consistent teams in Europe, having qualified for their first-ever FIFA Women's World Cup in 2003 and reaching the quarter-finals in two of the three European Championships held since 2000. In 2011, France recorded a fourth-place finish at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup; its best finish overall at the competition. In the following year, the team captured the 2012 Cyprus Cup and the fourth place at Women's Olympic Football Tournament.\n\nCorinne Diacre has been the manager of the national team since 30 August 2017. The current captain of the national team is midfielder Amandine Henry.\n\nIn 1919, a women's football championship was established in France by the \"Fédération des Sociétés Féminines Sportives de France\" (FSFSF). On 29 April 1920, a team led by French women's football pioneer Alice Milliat traveled to England and played its first international match against English team Dick, Kerr's Ladies. The match, held in Preston, attracted more than 25,000 spectators. France won the match 2–0 and ended its tour with two wins, one draw, and one defeat. The following year, a return match in France at the Stade Pershing in Vincennes, a suburb of Paris, took place in front of over 12,000 spectators. The match ended in a 1–1 draw. In May 1921, France returned to England for friendlies. The team won its first match 5–1, then suffered three consecutive defeats. In October 1921, the English team returned to France contesting matches in Paris and Le Havre with both matches ending in stalemates. Despite women's football in England being prohibited by The Football Association in December 1921, France continued to go there on tour for matches. A victory for the French in Plymouth was followed by 0–0 draws in Exeter and Falmouth. By 1932, the female game had been called to an end and the women's league formed in 1919 by the FSFSF was discontinued. The last match by the FSFSF international team was another scoreless draw against Belgium on 3 April 1932.\n\nThroughout the late 1960s in France, particularly in Reims, local players worked hard to promote awareness and the acceptance of women's football. A year before getting officially sanctioned, France took part in a makeshift European Cup against England, Denmark, and Italy. The tournament was won by the Italians. The Federal Council of the French Football Federation officially reinstated women's football in 1970 and France played its first official international match on 17 April 1971 against the Netherlands in Hazebrouck. That same year, France took part in the unofficial 1971 Women's World Cup, held in Mexico. The ladies continued the pirate games, which just made it into the margins of FIFA's records, until FIFA began overseeing the competition in 1991. Since 1982, UEFA has governed the European games.\n\nIn 1975, the women's football league was officially reinstated, this time with backing from the French Football Federation, the governing body of football in France. Stade Reims was the best team in the country throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, thus constituted much of the French national squad. For the non-official World Cup in 1978 in Taiwan, the team included the entire Reims squad. The team shared the title with Finland, who never actually played the final. Due to receiving minimal support from the French Football Federation, who ultimately looked at women's football as not being highly regarded, France struggled in international competition failing to advance past the first round of qualification in both the 1984 and 1987 UEFA Women's Championship. Francis Coché, who managed the team during these failures, was later replaced by Aimé Mignot. Mignot helped the team finally get past the first round, however, in the quarterfinals, they lost to Italy, which meant they wouldn't appear at the 1989 UEFA Women's Championship. Despite the initial positives, Mignot failed to continue his success with France failing to qualify for both the 1991 and 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup and losing in the first round of qualification in three straight UEFA Women's Championships. After almost a decade in charge, Mignot was replaced by former women's international Élisabeth Loisel.\n\nWith Loisel in charge, the FFF, along with then France national football team manager Aimé Jacquet, moved the women's national team to Clairefontaine, which had quickly become a high-level training facility for male football players. As a result of the move, younger women were afforded the same benefits from the facilities offered by Clairefontaine as the men. The success of female training led to the formation of the \"Centre National de Formation et d'Entraînement de Clairefontaine\", which is now referred to as the female section of the Clairefontaine academy. Under the tutelage of Loisel, the first results appeared encouraging. They reached their first-ever Women's World Cup qualifying for the 2003 edition after defeating England over two legs in a play-off game in London and again at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. The match in Saint-Étienne attracted more than 23,000 spectators and was broadcast by the popular French broadcasting company Canal Plus. Loisel's squad later qualified for the 2005 European Championship, where they were knocked out in the group stage. She was eventually sacked after failing to qualify for the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\nLoisel was replaced by former football player and now coach Bruno Bini. Bini had been in charge of several France female international youth sides before accepting the role and was tasked with the job of qualifying for UEFA Women's Euro 2009. Due to the success of the Clairefontaine project and the surprising emergence of the French women's first division, Division 1 Féminine, Bini inherited a team full of emerging, young, and influential talent, which included the likes of Camille Abily, Sonia Bompastor, Louisa Necib, Élise Bussaglia, Laura Georges, and Corine Franco. Bini was also provided with leadership from captain Sandrine Soubeyrand. Early results under Bini were extremely positive with France finishing first in their Euro qualifying group only conceded two goals. France also performed well in friendly tournaments, such as the Nordic Cup and Cyprus Cup. At UEFA Women's Euro 2009, France were inserted into the group of death, which consisted of themselves, world powerhouse Germany, no. 7 ranked Norway, and an underrated Iceland. France finished the group with 4 points, alongside Norway, with Germany leading the group. As a result of the competition's rules, all three nations qualified for the quarterfinals. In the knockout rounds, France suffered defeat to the Netherlands losing 5–4 on penalties after no goals were scored in regular time and extra time.\n\nCorinne Diacre is the current manager of France's women's national team and was appointed in August 2017. She has led the French national team to success as champions in the SheBelieves Cup in 2017 and runner-ups in 2018. \n\nBini's next task was to qualify for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup after the disappointment of four years earlier. In the team's qualifying group, France finished the campaign scoring 50 goals and conceded none over the course of ten matches (all wins). On 16 September 2010, France qualified for the World Cup following the team's 3–2 aggregate victory over Italy.\n\nAt the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany, France qualified to the knockout stage by finishing in second place in its group after wins over Nigeria and Canada, and a loss to the host team. The team went on to beat England on penalty kicks in the quarterfinals, but lost to the United States in the semi-finals. France finished the competition in fourth place and earned qualification to the Olympic football tournament at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London; it was the nation's first appearance in the competition. Striker Marie-Laure Delie was the only multiple goal scorer for France in the tournament, while defenders Sonia Bompastor and Laura Georges as well as midfielder Louisa Necib were selected to the All-Star Team.\n\nFrance has entered one of the most successful eras in the country's women's football history. In the UEFA Women's Euro 2013 held in Sweden, France stood top of the group, beating Spain, England and Russia to earn its ticket to the quarter-finals. However, Bergeroo's side lost to Denmark in a penalty shootout, thus failing to advance to the semi-finals.\n\nIn the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup held in Canada, France was listed to Pot 1, and was a favorite to become champions. France was named to Group F, alongside England, Mexico and Colombia. In the opening match against England, a goal from Eugénie Le Sommer gave France a 1–0 victory. However, France was shocked by Colombia in a 2–0 loss, making Colombia only the second Latin American team to win a Women's World Cup match. Therefore, France's third and final group stage match against Mexico was a must-win. France went on to beat Mexico 5–0 to qualify to the knockout round as top of the group.\n\nIn the knockout round, France eased past South Korea in a 3–0 win in Montreal to remain at the same location awaiting the quarter-final match against Germany. In the quarter-final match against Germany, despite dominating the majority of the match, France were unable to capitalize on their chances, which ultimately cost them the game. France were finally able to score in the 64th minute through Louisa Nécib, but failed to keep the lead as Célia Šašić scored on an 83rd-minute penalty kick. The score was 1–1 after 120 minutes, resulting in the match to be decided in a penalty shootout, where France's 5th penalty taken by Claire Lavogez was denied by Nadine Angerer, in which France were eliminated from the tournament losing 4–5 on penalty kicks.\n\nFrance won all matches at the UEFA Women's Euro 2017 qualifying Group 3. The home matches had sizable crowds, with 7,761 spectators attending the Romania match at the MMArena in Le Mans, 15,028 spectators at the Ukraine match at the Stade du Hainaut in Valenciennes, 24,835 spectators at the Greece match at Roazhon Park in Rennes, and 7,521 spectators at the Albania at Stade Jean-Bouin in Paris. The team scored a win and two draws at the UEFA Women's Euro 2017 Group C, and was defeated by England in quarter-finals.\n\nIn March 2015, France was selected to host the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup of the tournament. Having automatically qualified as hosts, France was considered a favorite to win the tournament, along with the United States. The team opened with three victories against Norway, Nigeria, and South Korea, winning its group with a total of 9 points. In the round of 16, France defeated Brazil by a score of 2-1, but lost to the United States in the quarterfinal with a score of 2–1. This Women's World Cup was particularly notable, as it was used as a platform by many women's teams to campaign for equal pay between men and women.\n\nThe following 23 players were named to the squad for the UEFA Women's Euro 2021 qualifier against on 9 November 2019.\nHead coach: Corinne Diacre\n\nThe following players were named to a squad in the last 12 months.\n\n\"Caps and goals may be incorrect.\"\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of matches in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2009388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009388", "title": "Rock Island District", "text": "Rock Island District\n\nThe Rock Island District (RI) is a Metra commuter rail line from Chicago, Illinois, southwest to Joliet. Metra does not refer to its lines by color, but the timetable accents for the Rock Island District line are \"Rocket Red\". This refers to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad's \"Rocket\" passenger trains.\n\nThe Suburban Line was built in 1870 as a steam dummy line, splitting from the main line just north of 99th Street, running west along 99th and turning south to the present line at the S-curve just south of 99th. The crossing of the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway midway along 99th was known as Dummy Crossing. In the early 1890s the line was extended north to 89th Street in conjunction with the expansion of the Chicago Terminal Transfer Railroad, and the portion on 99th was removed.\n\nThe track is owned by Metra, bought from the bankrupt Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad for $35 million in December 1982. The Regional Transportation Authority had signed a contract with the Rock Island in 1976 to fund service, and in 1980 the Chicago and North Western Railway began operating the Rock Island District. In spring 1981 the C&NW stepped away, and the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation (Metra) was formed to take over operations. Through freight trains on the line are operated by CSX and Iowa Interstate Railroad on a trackage rights agreement. In addition, Chicago Rail Link has rights to operate local freight service on the whole district, and it also uses the line between Gresham Wye and Blue Island to connect with the Iowa Interstate and Indiana Harbor Belt Railroads.\n\nA new station at 35th Street and Federal Street opened on April 3, 2011 to serve U.S. Cellular Field and the Illinois Institute of Technology. It was named 35th Street/'Lou' Jones/Bronzeville Station after Lovana Jones who was an Illinois State Representative in the Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nThe Englewood Flyover, an overpass located in the Chicago neighborhood of Englewood, eliminated delays for the Rock Island. The overpass replaced a diamond crossing with the Norfolk Southern's Chicago Line. The overpass proposed by Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE), which cost $142 million to construct, was completed in October 2014.\n\nIn recent years, Metra has expressed a desire to electrify and modernize the line if funding became available.\n\nThe February 2018 timetable shows 33 trains out of Chicago each weekday, of which 9 terminate at Blue Island, 23 at Joliet, and 1 at Tinley Park. Originally the train that terminates at Tinley Park terminated at New Lenox. The February 2018 timetable also shows 34 weekday trains in to Chicago of which 22 start at Joliet. The remaining 12 start at Blue Island-Vermont Street. Weekend express trains run through to Joliet, while weekend local trains make a short run to Blue Island. A few locals however, run down to Joliet.\n\nThe Rock Island District consists of the former Rock Island main line to Joliet and the slightly longer Suburban Line that loops to the west between Gresham and Blue Island. Most trains use the latter; the two stations on that part of the main line are served only during rush hour and during weekend express operations.\n\nIn June 2015, Metra began weekend express service on the Rock Island District. The six express trains that operate on both Saturday and Sunday run express from 35th Street to Blue Island-Vermont Street before making all stops to Joliet, bypassing the entire Beverly branch. Local trains run as well, making all stops on the Beverly branch and terminating at Blue Island-Vermont Street. This cuts about 20 minutes off the trips from Blue Island to downtown. On August 23, 2015, Metra announced that the weekend express service would become permanent upon completion of the trial period on November 29, 2015.\n\nThe Rock Island District runs a few empty equipment move (deadhead) trains, most during the weekdays. Inbound deadheads are scheduled between the Joliet, Mokena-Front Street, and Tinley Park stations and run to Blue Island-Vermont Street.\n\nThere are proposals to extend the line from Joliet to LaSalle-Peru in LaSalle County with intermediate stations at Rockdale, Minooka, Morris, Seneca, Marseilles, Ottawa and several others. A feasibility study was completed in 2003.\n\nAfter the passage of the Rebuild Illinois, $20 million was allocated for the long planned construction of a new Auburn Park station. Construction is expected to start in 2020.\n\nSince 2014 annual ridership has declined from 8.5 million to 7.5 million, an overall decline of 11.3%.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2009389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009389", "title": "Minicoy", "text": "Minicoy\n\nMinicoy, locally known as Maliku ; is an island in Lakshadweep, India. Along with Viringili, it is on \"Maliku atoll\", the southernmost atoll of Lakshadweep archipelago. Administratively, it is a census town in the Indian union territory of Lakshadweep.\n\nMinicoy is known as \"Maliku\" in the local language, Divehi, which is also the national and official language of the Republic of Maldives. The language is a descendant of Elu Prakrit and is closely related to the Sinhala language, but not mutually intelligible with it. However, the Lakhshadweep Administration refers to Divehi as Mahl. This is due to a misunderstanding on the part of a British civil servant who came to Minicoy in the Twentieth Century during the time of the Indian Empire. The official asked a local what his language was and he said \"Divehi-bas\". The Englishman looked confused as he had never heard of this language. Noticing this, the islander said \"Mahaldeebu\" as he knew that people on the subcontinent referred to the kingdom to the south (the Maldives) by that name. The English official recorded the language of Minicoy as Mahl.\n\nThe ancient name of Maliku was \"Mahiladū\" meaning women's island. Mahiladū derives from Elu Prakrit term \"Mahila du\", which literally means woman-island. \nHowever, the name \"Maliku\" is thought to have been derived from the Arab trader's term for the island, \"Jazirat al-Maliku\" ('the island of the king'). \n\nMinicoy islanders have long settled in the Nicobar Islands across the Bay of Bengal. These settlers regularly travelled back to Minicoy. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands had a reputation in the Maldives and Minicoy of being inhabited by cannibals, and so collectively the Andaman and Nicobar groups were called \"Minikaa-raajje\" by Maldive and Minicoy islanders. This meant \"cannibal kingdom\".\n\nA British official once asked a Minicoy islander what the name of his island was. The islander told the official that he was from Maliku but usually lived in \"Minikaa-raajje\" (Nicobar). The official thought Maliku and Minikaa were the same place and recorded the name of this islander's home as \"Minikaa\". This later became anglicised as Minicoy.\n\nLittle did this islander know that as a result of this cross-cultural exchange, his home would forever be called by a name that sounded like \"cannibal\" in his own language.\n\nMinicoy is the second largest and the southernmost among the islands of the Lakshadweep archipelago. It is located 201 km to the southsouthwest of Kalpeni, at the southern end of the Nine Degree Channel and 125 km to the north of Thuraakunu, Maldives, at the northern end of the Eight Degree Channel. The atoll is 10 km in length, having a maximum breadth of about 6 km. The closest geographic feature is the Investigator Bank, a submerged shoal located 31 km to the northeast.\n\nIt is located 400 km west off the coast of Trivandrum. The atoll contains two islands. The main island is located on the eastern and southeastern side of the lagoon, along the reef fringe. It measures about 10 km from its northern end to its southernmost point and it is about 1 km wide in its southern half, while the northern half is a narrow sandspit, often less than 100 m wide. Minicoy is almost completely covered with coconut trees. One of the few landmarks of the island is a tall lighthouse. On the southern side of the main island lies the uninhabited islet of Viringili (Dhivehi: ވިރިންގިލި ; , also called the Small Pox Island), measuring barely 200 m in length. Formerly the lepers of Minicoy were banished to this island where they lived in abject conditions.\n\nMaliku Atoll has a lagoon with two entrances in its northern side, Saalu Magu on the northeast and Kandimma Magu on the northwest. Its western side is fringed by a narrow reef and coral rocks awash. The interior of the lagoon is sandy and of moderate depth, rarely reaching 4 m. It has some coral patches.\n\nThis atoll is administered under the Indian Union Territory of Lakshadweep. Nine Degree Channel separates Minicoy and the Laccadive Islands. The closest island to Minicoy is Thuraakunu in the Republic of the Maldives. Since 1956, the Indian Government has forbidden the direct travelling between the two islands despite their geographic proximity and ethnographic similarities.\n\nMaliku Kandu is the traditional name of the broad channel between Minicoy (Maliku) and Ihavandippulhu (Haa Alif Atoll) in the Maldives. In the Admiralty Charts it is called Eight Degree Channel. Other names for this channel are Addigiri Kandu and Māmalē Kandu. It appeared in old French maps with the name Courant de Malicut.\n\nThere are total of eleven villages (\"athiris\")(\"avah\") in Minicoy Island. From North to South, they are:\n\n\nMinicoy has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification \"Aw\") with warm temperatures throughout the year. Precipitation falls during most of the year; only January to March are relatively dry.\n\nThere are remains in an area of the island known as \"Salliballu\" dating back from Minicoy's Buddhist past, about 800 years ago. The most conspicuous archaeological sites are two mounds or large heaps of ruins belonging to a stupa and another related structure. These sites were investigated by the Archaeological Survey of India in the 1980s. The excavations yielded few discoveries, for the sites had been much damaged and vandalized previously. Still, a much-damaged large Buddha head was found buried in the area. The name \"Salliballu\" originated in the local name for the \"Christian cross\", because the locals say that an inscription with a \"cross\" was found there. But it is likely that, coming from a Buddhist site, it was a cross-shaped mandala or visvavajra, like those often found on inscriptions in archaeological remains in the Maldives.\n\nLocal oral tradition has it that Kamborani and Kohoratukamana, two princesses from the Maldives, came to Maliku. When they arrived, the tivaru, who had been living there before, left the island for Sri Lanka. The Kamborani's descendants are the bodun (land- and shipowners) and the descendants of Kohoratukamana are the niamin (captains). The other status groups are made up of the descendants of their crew.\n\nThe affiliation of the island to the Laccadive Islands now known as Lakshadweep is rather recent. The term Lakshadweep, according to folk etymology, means a hundred thousand islands. The Laccadive group consists of only 25 islands and it is unlikely the name refers to a numerical value. According to ancient Sanskrit literature the term originally applied to all the island groups southsouthwest of the Indian Subcontinent, that is the Laccadive-Maldive-Chagos archipelagoes. Even then the number of islands is only around 2000.\n\nThe kings of the Maldives styled themselves as \"Kings of Twelve Thousand Islands\". This indicated a huge number rather than a numerical value. In the old Maldive duodecimal system of counting, twelve thousand was a round figure such as a hundred thousand in the decimal system. Clearly, therefore, twelve thousand was the figurative duodecimal equivalent of the decimal a hundred thousand. Even today in Maldive and Maliku speech, terms such as \"lakka duvas\" (a hundred thousand days) are used to refer to a huge number, in this case, a huge number of days (or time).\nUntil the 16th Century, the Laccadives appear to have been under the suzerainty of the Kolathiri Raja of Chirakkal in what is now the Indian state of Kerala. With the Portuguese ascendancy in the region, it became necessary for the Kolathiri to transfer sovereignty of the islands to their hereditary admiral, the Ali Raja of Kolathunadu | Cannanore. It is unclear if Maliku was included in this transfer or if in fact Maliku ever formed part of the dominions of the Kolathiri.\n\nStill, until relatively recently, the kings and queens of the Maldives issued edicts addressed to the subjects in their realm \"Malikaddu Midhemedhu\". This meant \"Between Maliku and Addu\". Previously Addu was the southernmost island in the dominions of the Maldive kings and was in Addu Atoll. The island was dredged off by the British in 1959 to construct the airfield on neighbouring Gan island. As late as AD 1696, a grant issued under the Seal of the King Siri Kula Ran Mani (Sultan Mohamed IV) of the Maldives referred to him as \"Malikaddu Midhemedhu ekanuonna mi korhu anikaneh nethee korhu\" which meant \"Sole Sovereign with no other over what lies between Maliku and Addu\". The grant was issued in the matter of the building and upkeep of a mosque in the island of Finey in Thiladhummathi Atoll, Maldives.\n\nOn 18 December 1790 Maliku was surrendered to the Court of Directors of the English East India Company by the Ali Raja of Cannanore, Junumabe Ali-Adi Raja Bibi II. The Ali Raja was allowed to administer Maliku in return for a tribute to the East India Company. She continued to dispute the transfer of sovereignty but in 1824, her successor, Mariambe Ali-Adi Raja Bibi made a formal written recognition of the suzerainty of the East India Company. She and her successors, however, continued the tributary arrangement.\n\nOn 27 July 1795, the Governor General of the Presidency of Madras under whose jurisdiction Maliku was, abolished Junumabe Ali Adi-Raja Bibi's coir monopoly. This was the beginning of the end of the Ali Raja's real control over Maliku.\n\nIn 1857, suzerainty over Maliku transferred from the East India Company to the Indian Empire when Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress.\n\nIn 1905 under the heavy burden of debts to the Empire, Mohamed Ali-Adi Raja agreed to surrender sovereignty and control over Maliku. He died before the formal transfer. After an attempt to backtrack, his successor Imbicchi Ali-Adi Raja Bibi finally signed over Maliku to the Emperor Edward VII on 9 February 1909, backdated to 1 July 1905. Following this, Maliku was annexed to the District of Malabar.\n\nIn August 1947 the possessions of the Emperor of India passed to either the Indian Union or Pakistan according to an agreed demarcation line. The rulers of the independent countries that were vassals of the Emperor had the choice of acceding to either India or Pakistan.\n\nWhile Maliku was a sovereign possession of the Emperor and not that of an independent country such as Cannanore, Kashmir or Hyderabad, it is unclear why India felt it necessary to hold a plebiscite in Maliku in 1956 to determine whether or not the people of Maliku wished to join the Indian Union. A referendum was held and an absolute majority of the Malikun decided to join the Indian Union. On 1 November 1956, Maliku was incorporated into the Union Territory of Laccadive, Minicoy, and Aminidivi Islands, renamed Lakshadweep in 1973. At this time, the Maldives was still not independent from the British. It is also unclear whether India had a legitimate right to hold it if Maliku was a sovereign possession of the Emperor. There were frequent contacts between the Maldives and Maliku travellers, but this was subsequently banned by the Indian government.\n\nMaliku Atoll has been under Indian administrations since the mid 16th century. It was the northernmost atoll of the historical Maldives before then. In December 1976, India and the Maldives signed a maritime boundary treaty whereby Maliku was placed on the Indian side of the boundary.\n\nHowever, on 26 July 1982, Abdulla Hameed, the half-brother of Maldivian president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and the Minister of Atolls for the Maldivian government, gave a speech in which he declared that Minicoy Island was part of the Maldives. The speech caused a minor diplomatic crisis between India and the Maldives, and Gayoom clarified that the speech was intended to highlight the linguistic, cultural, and religious ties between the Maldives and Minicoy and that the Maldives was not intending to make a political claim over the atoll. However, on social media, Maldivians increasingly express that Minicoy is a part of the Maldives.\n\nAn oral tradition of the Maldives (according to the late Magieduruge Ibrahim Didi, a Maldivian scholar from the island of Fuvahmulah) explains why Minicoy is not politically part of the Maldives anymore:\n\n\"Some time in the past (perhaps during the 17th century), Minicoy was devastated by a great cyclone which destroyed most houses and a great number of coconut trees. Following the catastrophe, a delegation of Minicoy islanders from the best families in the island sailed to the King in Malé asking for gold to help them through the hard times. However, the Maldive King told them that he had not enough money in his treasury as he had faced a Malabari invasion from the King of Kannur recently who stole the entire treasury and that he was not able to help them. Hence the delegation of Maliku nobles went onwards to the Malabar coast, where they found favor with the king of Cannanore (Kannur) who welcomed them and helped the Minicoy people to rebuild their island in exchange for their loyalty. Henceforth the Minicoy Islanders owed allegiance to this kingdom of the SW Indian shore.\".\n\n India census, the island of Minicoy had a population of 9,495. Males constitute 49% of the population and females 51%. Minicoy has an average literacy rate of 82%, higher than the national average of 74.04%: male literacy is 84%, and female literacy is 80%. In Minicoy, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. The people of Minicoy are ethnically Dhivehis and make up the third subgroup of Dhivehis referred as Mahls. The people locally identify themselves as \"Malikun\".\n\nThe cultural traits of Minicoy differ from those of any other island in Lakshadweep. Manners, customs, lifestyle and food are similar to those of the Maldives to the south of Minicoy and Malikubas (officially referred as Mahl by the Lakshadweep administration), a dialect of Dhivehi language, is spoken on the island. Like in other Dhivehi-speaking communities, the right-to-left Tāna script is used for writing.\n\nThe social structure is anthropologically interesting, being a matrilineal Muslim society with natolocal residence. A man will live in either his mother's or his wife's house. Remarriage for both men and women is accepted. Property is inalienable and owned by \"houses\" (matrilineal descent groups). As Muslims, they have conservative customs and traditions and yet they are liberal in approach. Here a man after marriage stays a member of his own mother's house throughout his life. Quite frequently Minicoy is referred to as the \"female island\" mentioned in the travelogue of Marco Polo.\n\nThuraakunu in the Maldives is the closest island to Minicoy. Formerly there was direct trade between both, and fishermen from both islands used to visit each other. This exchange continued even after Minicoy became part of the Indian Union after independence. However, since 1956 the Indian government has forbidden these visits between two nations. The people of Maliku are known as good sailors, and also for boat building and other crafts. The Indian seafarers originated from Maliku island.\n\nThe \"bodun\" owned land and \"bandu-odies\" (merchant ships); they were the \"vering\" (rulers). The \"niamin\" were pilots of the Bandu-odies and while on shore assisted the bodun in administrative and other leadership functions; they were custodians of property and supervised public work. The \"medhukimbin\" and the \"raaverin\" were working classes (the medhukimbin enjoying a status higher than the raaverin.) The raaverin tapped coconut palms for \"toddy\", a distinctive beverage converted into sweet palm syrup. Coconut vinegar, known as \"raahuiiy\", was also produced by the raaverin.\n\nEach village of Maliku has a \"Bodukaaka\" (male mayor) and \"Bodudhatha\" (female mayor) who conduct village business at a gathering known as \"Baemedu\". The Bodukaaka announces Baemedu by sending children of the village to each house. Male members gather in the village house to learn the purpose of the Baemedu. After the work is finished, there is a feast prepared by female members of the village.\n\nA newborn child is named on its day of birth (this is different from the Maldivian tradition of being named on the seventh day). The baby normally stays in the room in which it is born (which is customarily the ancestral home of the mother) for the first six days. The mother's house name becomes the child's surname. On the seventh day after birth, the baby is taken to the father's ancestral home, where jewellery is presented.\n\nAfter 20 days, the baby's head is shaven and the hair is weighed against something of value, traditionally gold or silver, which would be given to the poor. This ceremony is called \"boabeylun\".\n\nCircumcision of boys is followed by much celebration. Dancing and drumming in the evening forms part of the entertainment. The festivities usually continue for about a week.\n\nMinicoy islanders, like the other Lakshadweep islanders, follow Islam.\n\nUnder the Laccadive, Minicoy and Aminidivi Islands (Laws) Regulations, 1967 of the Government of India, the following people may enter Minicoy (Maliku):\n\n\nThe High Commissioner of India in Malé shall intimate the names of the persons whose visits are permitted and the period of their stay to the Administrator of Lakshadweep sufficiently in advance. The Administrator may, on valid grounds, extend the period of stay of Maldive nationals.\n\nMV \"Corals\", MV \"Lagoons\", MV \"Amindivi\", MV \"Arabian Sea\", MV \"Bharat Seema\", MV \"Dweep Setu\", MV \"Kavaratti\", MV \"Lakshadweep Sea\" and MV \"Minicoy\" are the important passenger ships connecting Lakshadweep with Kerala. The passage takes between 14 and 20 hours.\n\nAgatti Airport is the only civilian airport in Lakshadweep. Helicopter transfer is available from Agatti to Kavaratti throughout the year. The flight from Cochin to Agatti takes approximately one hour thirty minutes. Flights operate six days a week. The Government of India is planning to develop an airport at Minicoy Island to boost tourism and promote tuna fishing industry for improving livelihoods in Lakshadweep.\n\nThe emergence of historic port city Vizhinjam (Trivandrum) to its ancient glorious state as one of the major cities in India had forced the Ports Department to dust off an old proposal to launch a passenger ship service between Trivandrum and Minicoy. The distance between Trivandrum and Minicoy is just 398 km. The Lakshadweep authorities are also seeking an opportunity to invest in Kollam Port. They are ready to invest in a passenger terminal with dormitory facilities and an office to guide the people of Minicoy reaching Kollam Port.

It is situated on the Avocet Line which runs between Exeter St Davids and Exmouth.\n\nA station known as Woodbury Road opened with the railway on 1 May 1861; It was renamed Exton on 15 Sept 1958 and became Exton Halt on 28 February 1965 but has since lost the \"halt\" suffix in common with most similar stations. Its location on the banks of the River Exe was exploited for many years by placing a camping coach in the goods yard that could be hired by holidaymakers.\n\nThe station has a single platform that serves trains in both directions (it is on the left of a train arriving from Exeter) and faces out across the estuary of the River Exe.\n\nThe platform is much lower than usual in the United Kingdom which leads to a significant step up into the trains. This is difficult for the less mobile or for people with luggage, also while all trains carry wheelchair ramps, it is not possible to use them here. Requests to Railtrack and Network Rail to raise the platform have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nAbout half the trains on the Avocet Line from to and call at Exton on request. This means that passengers alighting here must tell the conductor that they wish to do so, and those waiting to join must signal clearly to the driver as the train approaches.\n\nConnections are available at for also and other stations to Waterloo; passengers for other main line stations change at St Davids.\n"}

{"id": "2009409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009409", "title": "Metra Electric District", "text": "Metra Electric District\n\nThe Metra Electric District is an electrified commuter rail line owned and operated by Metra which connects Millennium Station (formerly Randolph Street Station), in downtown Chicago, with the city's southern suburbs. As of 2018, it is the fifth busiest of Metra's 11 lines, after the BNSF, UP-NW, UP-N, and UP-W with nearly 7.7 million annual riders. While Metra does not explicitly refer to any of its lines by color, the timetable accents for the Metra Electric District are printed in bright \"Panama orange\" to reflect the line's origins with the Illinois Central Railroad (IC) and its \"Panama Limited\" passenger train. It is the only Metra line running entirely on dedicated passenger tracks, with no freight trains operating anywhere along the route. The line is the only one in the Metra system with more than one station in Downtown Chicago, and also has the highest number of stations (49) than any other Metra line.\n\nIt is the only Metra line powered by overhead catenary, and the only one with three branches. Trains operate on 1500 volts direct current, and all stations have high-level platforms. Its main line north of Kensington is shared by NICTD's South Shore Line, an electric interurban line through northern Indiana to South Bend. Per a longstanding non-compete agreement, South Shore trains stopping at stations shared with the Electric District only stop to pick up passengers eastbound and discharge them westbound.\n\nIt is the only Metra line with significant off-peak and Saturday service. In total, 76 trains depart Millennium Station according to the Monday-Friday public timetable. Of these, 40 run on the main line with 26 reaching University Park, 5 terminating at Flossmoor, and 4 terminating at Harvey. The stretch of the line from Millennium Station to 55th-56th-57th Street is the most heavily traveled section on the entire Metra system. Suburban operations along the line are the most frequent in the entire Metra system. The Metra Electric District also has the best on-time performance of all Metra lines, averaging only one late train a month in 2014.\n\nThe line was built by the Illinois Central Railroad, one of the first commuter services outside the major metropolitan areas of the northeastern United States. It opened on July 21, 1856 between the IC's then-downtown station, Great Central Station, (now Millennium Station) and Hyde Park. Part of the line was elevated for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Jackson Park.\n\nThe line predates the 1871 Great Chicago Fire, and ran on a trestle just offshore in Lake Michigan. After the fire, remains of buildings destroyed by the fire were dumped into the lake, creating landfill that forms the foundation of Grant Park, which the Metra Electric District runs through.\n\nTwo branches were added: from Brookdale southeast to South Chicago in the early 1880s, and from Kensington southwest to Blue Island in the early 1890s, both later electrified along with the main line.\n\nWhen the IC moved its intercity operations to Central Station in 1893, it built Randolph Street Terminal on the former site of Great Central to handle its growing commuter operations.\n\nBy the early 20th century the IC operated up to 300 steam trains each day. In 1919, the IC and the Chicago city government collaborated to build a berm from the far south suburb of Homewood into the city. They also dug a trench from the near south side into the city proper, eliminating all grade crossings on the main line except one just south of the Richton Park station. The University Park extension required the line to cross a very long private driveway. The South Chicago branch runs at grade, crossing many city streets.\n\nThe grade crossing elimination project was followed by electrification. The IC electrified the commuter tracks in 1926, from downtown to Matteson. In addition to the removal of all grade crossings, the tracks were separated from, and moved to the west side of, the two freight and inter-city tracks. At McCormick Place just south of downtown Chicago, the two non-electrified tracks to Central Station crossed over the new electric alignment. The electric tracks continued north to Randolph Street Terminal.\n\nThe \"IC Electric\" was once Chicago's busiest suburban railroad, and carried a great deal of traffic within the city as well as to suburban communities. The three lines carried 26 million passengers in 1927, the first full year of electrified operation. Ridership rose to 35 million in 1929, and reached an all-time peak of 47 million in 1946.\n\nService was extended southward from Matteson to Richton Park, a new station at the south end of the coach storage yard, in 1946.\n\nThe main line had six tracks between Roosevelt Road (Central Station) and 53rd Street (reduced to four in 1962), four to 111th Street, then two. The South Chicago branch has two tracks and the Blue Island branch has a single track.\n\nThe Illinois Central Gulf commuter rail crash, the worst rail accident in Chicago history, occurred on October 30, 1972. A commuter train made up of new lightweight bi-level Highliner cars, inbound to Randolph Street Station during the morning rush hour, overshot the 27th Street platform and backed up into the station. The bi-level train had already tripped the signals to green for the next train, an older, heavy steel single-level express train. As the bi-level train was backing up at , it was struck by the single-level train at full speed. The single-level train telescoped the bi-level train, killing 45 passengers and injuring hundreds more, primarily in the bi-level train. A major contributing factor was that Illinois Central Gulf used a dark gray color scheme on the front ends of the Highliner fleet, which was very difficult to see on the cloudy morning of the accident. After the accident the ends of all of the ICG 1926 heavyweight still in use and Highliner MU fleet were partially painted with bright orange added for additional visibility.\n\nIn 1976 the Regional Transportation Authority signed a contract with Illinois Central Gulf to fund its commuter service. The next year an extension of was built to the current terminal at University Park (originally named Park Forest South). On May 1, 1987 Metra bought the line and its branches for $28 million. The line is now operated by Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Rail Corporation, Metra's operating subsidiary. Two inter-city freight tracks retained by the ICG are now part of the Canadian National Railway, used by Amtrak's \"City of New Orleans\", \"Illini\" and \"Saluki\" trains.\n\nFrom 1988 onward, Randolph Street Terminal was under near-perpetual construction. The construction of Millennium Park moved the station completely underground, and in 2005 it was renamed Millennium Station.\n\nThe Metra Electric is the only line on the Metra system in which all stations (except 18th and 47th Streets, both flag stops) have ticket vending machines. The machines originally sold magnetically encoded tickets which unlocked the turnstiles. People with paper tickets or weekend passes, on reduced fares or who had trouble with the vending machines had to use a blue or orange pal phone to contact an operator who would unlock the turnstiles. Complaints from passengers who missed their trains caused Metra to remove the turnstiles in November 2003.\n\nThe main line and South Chicago branch run daily, but the Blue Island Branch does not operate on Sundays or holidays. A unique feature of the Metra Electric schedule is the similarity of the weekday and Saturday timetables. Many express trains run throughout the day in both directions. On other Metra lines, express service operates exclusively during the morning and afternoon rush hours. It is the only Metra line where all trackage is used exclusively for commuter service. Freight trains and Amtrak trains run on a pair of adjacent tracks owned by the Canadian National Railroad.\n\nOff-peak and Saturday service is frequent, while Sunday service operates hourly north of 63rd Street and every 2 hours south of 63rd.\n\nThe proposed Gold Line, derived from the earlier and more extensive Gray Line plan would have the Electric District operate more like a rapid transit line, by running trains more frequently (every ten minutes between 6am and midnight) with reduced-fare transfers to CTA buses and trains. Unlike the current service, which bypasses many stations to reach suburban stations more quickly, it would make all stops within the city. It would run from Millennium Station to South Chicago (93rd Street) at an estimated cost at $160 million. Since the Gold Line was proposed, the idea of providing rapid transit service along Chicago's south lakefront has gained considerable support from neighborhoods along its route. Despite its popular support, officials from CTA and Metra have largely dismissed the plan, focussing on other expansion projects. In response to this and other concerns, in 2009 the RTA and the Chicago Department of Transportation authorized $450,000 for a \"South Lakefront Study\" that is anticipated to yield either one or two new transit projects that are eligible for Federal transit funding.\n\nAn extension to Peotone, Illinois has been considered since the SouthWest Service was extended to Manhattan.\n\nOn May 24, 2017, Metra announced new schedule proposals for the line. The new schedule will provide rapid service for the Hyde Park stations every 20 minutes on weekdays until 7 p.m. and every half-hour on Saturdays. The proposed schedule also calls for boosting service on the main line from 63rd Street to Kensington, from every two hours to every hour. However, the proposed schedule also calls for the elimination of lightly used Blue Island trains, including all Saturday service.\n\nAfter reviewing community feedback, Metra decided to keep four Saturday Blue Island trains and one late night trip to South Chicago. The new service went into effect September 11, 2017.\n\nSince 2014 annual ridership has declined from 9.4 million to 7.7 million, an overall decline of 18.1%.\n\nThe Metra Electric District uses second-generation bi-level Highliner multiple unit cars built by Nippon Sharyo. These will be supplemented by additional EMU's built at Nippon Sharyo's new Rochelle, IL facility opened in 2012. In 2005, these began to replace the original Highliner fleet built by St. Louis Car Company and Bombardier in the 1970s.\n\nOn February 12, 2016 the original Highliners left on their last run in revenue service. Metra confirmed in a Facebook post that twenty-four cars are being sent to museums around the Midwestern United States, including the Illinois Railway Museum, while an unconfirmed source stated that some cars were sent to Mendota, Illinois to be scrapped.\n\nThe branch leaves the mainline south of the former 67th Street station.\nThe branch leaves the main line south of .\n\n"}

It has a lower electrical conductivity and can be run at higher speeds than can gels made from TAE buffer (5-30V/cm as compared to 5-10V/cm). At a given voltage, the heat generation and thus the gel temperature is much lower than with TAE buffers, therefore the voltage can be increased to speed up electrophoresis so that a gel run takes only a fraction of the usual time. Downstream applications, such as isolation of DNA from a gel slice or Southern blot analysis, work as expected when using lithium acetate gels.\n\nLithium boric acid or sodium boric acid are usually preferable to lithium acetate or TAE when analyzing smaller fragments of DNA (less than 500 bp) due to the higher resolution of borate-based buffers in this size range as compared to acetate buffers.\n\nLithium acetate is also used to permeabilize the cell wall of yeast for use in DNA transformation.

{"id": "2009412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009412", "title": "Geosmin", "text": "Geosmin\n\nGeosmin is an irregular sesquiterpene, produced from the universal sesquiterpene precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (also known as farnesyl diphosphate), in a two-step -dependent reaction. Geosmin, along with the irregular monoterpene 2-Methylisoborneol, together account for the majority of biologically-caused taste and odor outbreaks worldwide. Geosmin has a distinct earthy or musty odor, which most people can easily smell. The odor detection threshold of geosmin is very low, ranging from 0.006 to 0.01 micrograms per liter in water. Geosmin is also responsible for the earthy taste of beetroots and a contributor to the strong scent (petrichor) that occurs in the air when rain falls after a dry spell of weather or when soil is disturbed. \n\nIn chemical terms, it is a bicyclic alcohol with formula , a derivative of decalin. Its name is derived from the Ancient Greek \"earth\" and \"smell\". The word was coined in 1965 by the American biochemist Nancy N. Gerber (1929–1985) and the French-American biologist Hubert A. Lechevalier (1926–2015).\n\nGeosmin is produced by various blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) and filamentous bacteria in the class Actinomyces, and also some other prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The main genera in the cyanobacteria that have been shown to produce geosmin include \"Anabaena\", \"Phormidium\", and \"Planktothrix\", while the main genus in the Actinomyces that produces geosmin is \"Streptomyces\". Communities whose water supplies depend on surface water can periodically experience episodes of unpleasant-tasting water when a sharp drop in the population of these bacteria releases geosmin into the local water supply. Under acidic conditions, geosmin decomposes into odorless substances.\n\nIn 2006, the biosynthesis of geosmin by a bifunctional \"Streptomyces coelicolor\" enzyme was unveiled. A single enzyme, geosmin synthase, converts farnesyl diphosphate to geosmin in a two-step reaction.\n\nNot all blue-green algae cyanobacteria produce geosmin. Identification of species that might produce geosmin is traditionally done through microscopic identification of algae as geosmin producers, a technique that is labor-intensive and requires specialized knowledge. Recent advances in molecular biology have enabled identification of a geosmin synthase gene, \"geoA\", which is present in cyanobacterial species that produce geosmin, but is not present in other cyanobacterial species . Amplification of this gene from water samples using real-time PCR may permit predictions of taste and odor events caused by cyanobacteria in fresh water. \n\"Streptomyces coelicolor\" is the model representative of a group of soil-dwelling bacteria with a complex lifecycle involving mycelial growth and spore formation. Besides the production of volatile geosmin, it also produces many other complex molecules of pharmacological interest; its genome sequence is available at the Sanger Institute.\n\nThe human nose is extremely sensitive to geosmin and is able to detect it at concentrations as low as 5 parts per trillion.\n\nGeosmin is responsible for the muddy smell in many commercially important freshwater fish such as carp and catfish. Geosmin combines with 2-methylisoborneol, which concentrates in the fatty skin and dark muscle tissues. It breaks down in acid conditions; hence, vinegar and other acidic ingredients are used in fish recipes to reduce the muddy flavor. Taste and odor compounds including geosmin lead to an unpleasant taste of drinking water which is perceived by consumers as an indication of poor water quality.\n\nThis compound is also an issue for saltwater fish farmed in recirculating aquaculture systems, such as Atlantic salmon. These systems rely on biological filtration using cultured microbial communities to process the nitrogenous waste from the fish (ammonia) into less harmful compounds (nitrite and nitrate) that can be tolerated at higher concentrations. However geosmin-producing bacteria can also grow in these systems, and often require fish to be transferred to an additional \"finishing\" or \"purge\" system where they are not fed for several days prior to harvest to remove off-flavor compounds and empty the intestinal tract. This process is also known as depuration.\n\n\n"}

In the 1922 general election he unsuccessfully fought the Newbury seat for the Liberal Party; he was elected to the seat in the general election of 1923 with a majority of just 41 votes.\n\nIn Parliament Stranger allied with the left-wing of the Liberal Party. With 12 other Liberal MPs, he refused to join the majority of the party in voting for a motion which the Labour government had declared a motion of no confidence in October 1924, and backed the government instead.

This version soon disintegrated, and some years later a new line-up emerged, this time based in Manchester.\n\nA short lived 1986 version of World of Twist featured Gordon King (vocalist and co-songwriter), Tony Ogden (co-songwriter), Andy Hobson (Bass, Keyboards), Neil Drabble (visuals).\n\nThe 1989 version of World Of Twist featured Ogden (now vocalist and co-songwriter), King (guitar and co-songwriter), and Hobson (synthesisers) joined by Alan Frost (visual effects, synthesisers), Julia aka M.C. Shells (swirls and sea noises) and Angela Reilly (visual effects). Nick Sanderson (drums) joined some time later.\n\nA demo tape (featuring \"The Storm\", \"Blackpool Tower Suite\", \"The Spring\", and \"She's a Rainbow\") released in early 1990 drew attention to the band, and a recording contract with Circa Records followed. The record label issued the singles \"The Storm\" (produced by Clif Brigden) that same year with \"Sons of the Stage\" also (produced by Clif Brigden) and \"Sweets\" following in 1991. A cover of The Rolling Stones' \"She's a Rainbow\", originally issued as the B-side of \"The Storm\", was reissued with new dance mixes by Fluke in 1992. The original B-side version had been one of the last tracks produced by Martin Hannett, who died in 1991.\n\nThe band's live show and Radio 1 sessions for John Peel and Mark Goodier, and the first two Clif Brigden produced singles raised expectations, but their debut album, \"Quality Street\" (1991), met with little critical or commercial acclaim.\n\nWhilst John Peel's Radio 1 show was broadcasting during the 1990 World Cup, a listener's letter was read out on air recalling that when a World Of Twist single was played during one of England's previous Cup games, England scored during the record's air-time. The letter pleaded for Peel to play it again if England needed a goal. 81 minutes into the game, Gary Lineker scored to level the game at 1-1. This forced extra time & penalties, \nand Peel must have been contemplating repeating the play of the record.\n\nWhile World of Twist never toured in North America, \"Sons of the Stage\" was an indie/club hit in Toronto and New York. Oasis considered naming themselves after the song, and it was later covered by Oasis's successor group Beady Eye, as a B-side to their debut single, \"Bring the Light\".\n\nWork began on a follow up album and there were plans for further touring, but problems emerged when Ogden decided that he no longer wanted to sing. This, coupled with creative differences within the band, contributed to the demise of the group in 1992.\n\nGordon King, James Fry and Nick Sanderson went on to form Earl Brutus in 1993 with Rob Marche (formerly of Joboxers and Subway Sect) and Stuart Boreman.

{"id": "2009431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009431", "title": "Caracazo", "text": "Caracazo\n\nThe Caracazo, or sacudón, is the name given to the wave of protests, riots, looting, shootings and massacres that started on 27 February 1989 in Guarenas, spreading to Caracas and surrounding towns. The weeklong clashes resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people, thousands by some accounts, mostly at the hands of security forces and the military. The riots and the protests began mainly in response to the government's economic reforms and the resulting increase in the price of gasoline and transportation.\n\nThe term, “Caracazo,” stems from the city’s name, Caracas, and “-azo,” which stems from another historic event, the Bogotazo, was a massive riot in Bogotá, recognized as having a crucial role in Colombia’s history. “Caracazo” is technically defined as the “Caracas smash” or “the big one in Caracas” based on Spanish dialect.\n\nA fall in oil prices in the mid-1980s caused an economic crisis to take hold in Venezuela, and the country had accrued significant levels of debt. Nevertheless, the administration of the left-leaning President Jaime Lusinchi was able to restructure the country's debt repayments and offset an economic crisis but allow for the continuation of the government's policies of social spending and state-sponsored subsidies.\n\nLusinchi's political party, the Democratic Action, was able to remain in power following the 1988 election of Carlos Andrés Pérez as president. Pérez received 53% of the vote, while the others gained at least 40%. Pérez then proposed a major shift in policy by implementing economic reforms recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The program, called \"El Gran Viraje\" (The Great Turn), but popularly known as the \"paquete\" (the \"package\"), was contrary to statements made during Pérez's populist campaign in which he had described the IMF as \"a neutron bomb that killed people, but left buildings standing.\"\n\nMeasures taken by Pérez included privatizing state companies, tax reform, reducing customs duties, and diminishing the role of the state in the economy. He also took measures to decentralize and modernize the Venezuelan political system by the direct election of state governors, who had previously been appointed by the president. The most controversial part of the economic reform package was the reduction of the gasoline subsidies, which had long maintained domestic gasoline prices far beneath international levels and even the production costs. On the weekend of 25-26 February 1989, gasoline prices rose 100 per cent, as had been laid out in the economic adjustment program announced by the government on February 16. The fuel price increase in turn necessitated an increase in public transportation fares of 30 per cent officially, and more in practice as some carriers refused to limit their prices to the official rate.\n\nAccording to retired Venezuelan General Carlos Julio Peñaloza Zambrano, Cuban agents might have entered Venezuela during Carlos Andrés Pérez's inauguration ceremony, which was attended by Fidel Castro, and may have waited for unrest to occur in Venezuela so they could exacerbate political tensions.\n\nThe protests and rioting began on the morning of 27 February 1989 in Guarenas, a town in Miranda State about east of Caracas, due to the increase in public transportation prices. The protests and rioting quickly spread to the capital and other towns across the country. A lack of timely intervention by authorities –some police were under orders not to take action– led the Metropolitan Police to be quickly overwhelmed. The protests spread to Caracas, whose Metropolitan Police was on a labour strike.\n\nDespite initial debate within the government over how to manage the situation, a heavy-handed approach was implemented as a state of emergency and martial law were imposed. On February 28, Pérez suspended a number of articles of the Constitution, including Article 60 (right to individual liberty and security), Article 62 (inviolability of the home), Article 66 (freedom of expression), Article 71 (right to gather publicly and privately), and Article 115 (right to peaceful protest). The rights were not completely restored until March 22, and in the interim, there was no official decree or resolution to define how government authority would be exercised in the absence of those constitutional rights.\n\nBy the time authorities encountered the scenes of rioting, citizens began firing weapons at officers, with the ensuing firefights resulting in many bystanders being killed by \"bullets from army troops and from sniping protesters.\" In many poor areas, citizens destroyed their own local commercial facilities, with food markets so damaged that their food distribution system was ruined. Much of the rioters destroyed properties indiscriminately, with no motives related to initial protests. According to Amnesty International, tactics used by security forces included \"disappearances,\" the use of torture, and extrajudicial killings. As part of the government's security forces, members of Hugo Chávez's MBR-200 allegedly participated in the crackdown. Chávez himself was sick that day with measles. As tensions eased, troops began to sweep through neighborhoods collecting appliances and cash registers and informing citizens that if they provided a certificate of purchase, the items would be returned.\n\nThe initial official pronouncements stated that 276 people had died but many estimates put the number at above 2,000. Shortages of coffins were reported and many Venezuelans had to line up at government food distribution centers since markets were destroyed by rioters. Insurance estimates of damage caused during the rioting were $90 million CAD ($120 million 2017 USD).\n\nOn March 3, 1989, President Carlos Andres Pérez spoke with U.S. President George H. W. Bush. President Bush offered Pérez a US$450 million emergency loan. Pérez thanked Bush and asked him to support a change in debt policy toward Latin America: \"I want to tell you if there is no change in [international] debt policy then whatever we may do here may be useless.\" Pérez told Bush that he had sent him a letter several days earlier and that he would appreciate it if he would read it. Pérez also visited Bush in Washington on April 1, 1989. \n\nThe clearest consequence of the \"Caracazo\" was political instability. The following February, the army was called to contain similar riots in Puerto La Cruz and Barcelona and again in June, when rising of transportation costs ended in riots in Maracaibo and other cities. The reforms were modified.\n\nThe MBR-200 repudiated the Caracazo and accelerated its preparation for a coup d'état against the Perez government. In 1992, there were two attempted coups in February and November. Pérez was later accused of corruption and removed from the presidency. Chávez, a MBR-200 leader and an organiser of one of the coups, was found guilty of sedition and incarcerated. However, he was subsequently pardoned by Pérez's successor, Rafael Caldera, and he went on to be elected president after the latter. Chavez later explained that after the event, \"the members of the MBR 200 realized we had passed the point of no return and we had to take up arms. We could not continue to defend a murderous regime.\"\n\nIn 1998, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights condemned the government's action and referred the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. In 1999, the Court heard the case and found that the government had committed violations of human rights, including extrajudicial killings. The Venezuelan government, by then headed by Chávez, did not contest the findings of the case and accepted full responsibility for the government's actions.\n\nIn August 2009, Defense Minister Italo del Valle Alliegro was charged in relation to the Caracazo. In July 2010, the Supreme Court overturned an appeal court ruling, which had declared the case covered by a statute of limitations.\n\n\n"}

They are noted for their docile nature, and gentle disposition.\n\nBonnie Seeley of High Bridge, New Jersey, introduced the Jersey Wooly at the 1984 American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) Convention in Orlando, Florida. It was recognized by the ARBA in 1988. Today, the Jersey Wooly is one of the most widely-exhibited rabbits at local and national shows in the United States. They are also renowned as highly docile pets.\n\nThe Jersey Wooly was developed by crossing the Netherland Dwarf and the French Angora. The result of this cross was a petite rabbit with a wool coat. Early Jersey Woolies still maintained the oblong body shape of the French Angora, made smaller by the influence of the dwarfing gene.\n\nA full grown Jersey Wooly weighs 1 - 1.5 kg (2.5 - 3.5 pounds) with 3 lbs being considered ideal. They have a compact body type. The ears are small and erect, standing about 2 inches long. 3 inch ears are the maximum length allowed for exhibition stock per the ARBA's Standard of Perfection. When showing a Jersey Wooly, people must know that the head and ears have the most points. The head is bold and squarish which led the breed to being affectionately referred to as the \"Mug Head.\" These rabbits are very affectionate and playful and most Jersey Woolys have very friendly personalities. As pets, they range from laid-back lap bunnies to outgoing explorers.\n\nThe average life span of a Jersey Wooly can depend on many factors, including genetics and care. It is not uncommon for a Jersey Wooly to live 7-10+ years when properly cared for. There is a common myth that those who have had litters die sooner, but this has not been scientifically proven. Many rabbit breeders have healthy Jersey Woolys who have had multiple litters live just as long as pet Jersey Woolys who have never had babies. It is also believed that neutering and spaying these rabbits will add years to their life span. Without neutering or spaying, rabbits can develop cancer and tumors that are life-threatening. A competent, experienced exotics veterinarian is the best way to minimize surgical complications.\nA Jersey Wooly's coat should be brushed regularly. Brushing the wool with a sharp wire brush is not recommended, as the wire can damage the Wooly's very sensitive skin. Jersey Woolies can be housed in a hutch or cage with suitable space of at least four feet. Rabbits are easy to litter box train and litter boxes should have an absorbent material underneath such as paper litter never ceder or cat litter, with plenty of hay on top. Rabbits should have access to hay 24/7 and hay should be a good quality and mold free. Also, they should have a healthy pelleted food and treats such as green vegetables (not lettuce unless Romaine) and the occasional small piece of fruit (not citrus or tomato). Not all rabbits enjoy being cuddled and played with by their owner, but many will engage if you meet them down at their level while they romp about in a safe environment outside their habitat, playing with rabbit-safe toys.\n\nHandling and petting your rabbit helps you to know their body. If any unusual nodes or masses show themselves, you may be able to get a jump on treatment. Albon can be used to combat these infections. Amoxicillin should never be used as it is fatal to rabbits. Don't be afraid to ask for treatment.\n\n\n"}

It does not appear particularly bright in the sky to the naked eye, with a visual apparent magnitude of +3.97. However, this is due to its distance; in reality, the star is more than double the effective temperature of the Sun and nearly three times as massive, with a luminosity in visible wavelengths about 117 times greater than that of the Sun. Based on an excess emission of infrared radiation, it may have a debris disk, much like Vega. \n\nThis is a single-lined spectroscopic binary system. The ROSAT All Sky Survey discovered that Alpha Sagittarii is emitting an excess flux of X-rays, which is not expected to originate from a star of this spectral class. The most likely explanation is that the companion is an active pre-main sequence star or else a star that has just reached the main sequence.\n\n\"α Sagittarii\" (Latinised to \"Alpha Sagittarii\") is the star's Bayer designation. It is unclear why Bayer designated this star as the alpha, rather than Epsilon Sagittarii or Sigma Sagittarii. This led some old star charts to occasionally depict Alpha and Beta Sagittarii as much brighter than they are in reality, as they are invisible from northern Europe, being too far south to see there.\n\nThe star bore the traditional names \"Rukbat\" and \"Alrami\", derived from the Arabic \"rukbat al-rāmī\" 'the knee of the archer'. The star Delta Cassiopeiae also bore the traditional names \"Ruchbah\" or \"Rukbat\", from the Arabic word ركبة \"rukbah\" meaning \"knee\". In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included \"Rukbat\" for this star (Delta Cassiopeiae was later given the name \"Ruchbah\").\n\nIn Chinese, (), meaning \"Celestial Spring\", refers to an asterism consisting of Alpha Sagittarii, Beta¹ Sagittarii and Beta² Sagittarii.

He was a member of a famous noble Venetian family (the Morosini family) which produced several Doges and generals. He \"dressed always in red from top to toe and never went into action without his cat beside him.\" \n\nMorosini first rose to prominence as Captain-General of the Venetian forces on Crete during the siege of Candia by the Ottoman Empire. He was eventually forced to surrender the city, and was accused of cowardice and treason on his return to Venice; however, he was acquitted after a brief trial.\n\nIn 1685, at the outbreak of the Morean War, Morosini took command of a fleet against the Ottomans. Over the next several years, he captured the Morea with the help of Otto Wilhelm Königsmarck, as well as Lefkada and parts of western Greece. He also briefly captured Athens but was unable to hold it, and attempted a failed siege of the former Venetian fortress of Negroponte. His fame reached such heights that he was given the victory title \"Peloponnesiacus\", and was the first Venetian citizen to have a bronze bust placed during his own lifetime in the Great Hall, with the inscription \"Francisco Morosini Peloponnesiaco, adhuc vivendi, Senatus\".\n\nDuring the siege of Athens in 1687 at the Morean War, his artillery turned the Parthenon from a functioning building to a simple ruin, and he personally oversaw the looting of some of the surviving sculptures. The Parthenon was used as a powder magazine by the Ottomans when on September 26, 1687, Morosini's cannon scored a direct hit on the edifice. An attaché of the Swedish field commander General Otto Wilhelm Königsmarck wrote later: \"How it dismayed His Excellency to destroy the beautiful temple which had existed three thousand years!\". By contrast Morosini, who was the commander in chief of the operation, described it in his report to the Venetian government as a \"fortunate shot\".\n\nWhen he conquered Acropolis in early 1688, Morosini tried to loot Athena's and Poseidon's horses and chariots from the west pediment of the Parthenon but the sculptures fell on the ground and smashed. This was the first documented attempt to remove sculptures from the pediments.\nThe Ottoman Empire regained possession of the monument in the following year and having noticed the demand began to sell souvenirs to Westerners.\n\nMorosini also looted from the port of Piraeus the famous Piraeus Lion which is on display at the Venetian Arsenal.\n\nIn the summer of 1688, Morosini, now having been proclaimed Doge of Venice, attacked Negropont but was unable to capture it and was forced to return to Venice when plague broke out among his troops. He embarked on a final campaign in 1693, but was again unsuccessful in taking Negropont, and returned to Venice after sacking some minor coastal towns. After his death in 1694, a large marble arch was placed in his honor at the Doge's Palace, and his cat, of which Morosini was notably fond, was embalmed and taken to the Museo Correr.\n\n\n"}

The virus (\"EIAV\") is endemic in the Americas, parts of Europe, the Middle and Far East, Russia, and South Africa. The virus is a lentivirus, like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Like HIV, EIA can be transmitted through blood, milk, and body secretions.\nTransmission is primarily through biting flies, such as the horse-fly and deer-fly. The virus survives up to 4 hours in the vector. Contaminated surgical equipment and recycled needles and syringes, and bits can transmit the disease. Mares can transmit the disease to their foals via the placenta.\nThe risk of transmitting the disease is greatest when an infected horse is ill, as the blood levels of the virus are then highest.\n\nAcute: The acute form is a sudden onset of the disease at full-force. Symptoms include high fever, anemia (due to the breakdown of red blood cells), weakness, swelling of the lower abdomen and legs, weak pulse, and irregular heartbeat. The horse may die suddenly.\n\nSubacute: A slower, less severe progression of the disease. Symptoms include recurrent fever, weight loss, an enlarged spleen (felt during a rectal examination), anemia, and swelling of the lower chest, abdominal wall, penile sheath, scrotum, and legs.\n\nChronic: The horse tires easily and is unsuitable for work. The horse may have a recurrent fever and anemia, and may relapse to the subacute or acute form even several years after the original attack.\n\nA horse may also not appear to have any symptoms, yet still tests positive for EIA antibodies. Such a horse can still pass on the disease. According to most veterinarians, horses diagnosed EIA positive usually do not show any sign of sickness or disease.\n\nEIA may cause abortion in pregnant mares. This may occur at any time during the pregnancy if there is a relapse when the virus enters the blood. Most infected mares will abort, however some give birth to healthy foals. Foals are not necessarily infected.\n\nStudies indicate that there are breeds with a tolerance to EIA.\n\nRecent studies in Brazil on living wild horses have shown that in the Pantanal, about 30% of domesticated and about 5.5% of the wild horses are chronically infected with EIA.\n\nA vaccine is available, called \"Chinese Live Attenuated EIA vaccine\", developed in China and widely used there since 1983. Another attenuated live virus vaccine is in development in the United States.\n\nReuse of syringes and needles is a risk factor for transfer of the disease. Currently in the United States, all horses that test positive must be reported to federal authorities by the testing laboratory. EIA-positive horses are infected for life. Options for the horse include sending the horse to a recognized research facility, branding the horse and quarantining it at least 200 yards from other horses for the rest of its life, and euthanizing the horse. Very few quarantine facilities exist, which usually leads to the option of euthanizing the horse. The Florida Research Institute for Equine Nurturing, Development and Safety (a.k.a. F.R.I.E.N.D.S.) is one of the largest such quarantine facilities and is located in south Florida.\nThe horse industry and the veterinary industry strongly suggest that the risks posed by infected horses, even if they are not showing any clinical signs, are enough of a reason to impose such stringent rules. The precise impacts of the disease on the horse industry are unknown.\n\nThe Coggins test (agar immunodiffusion) is a sensitive diagnostic test for equine infectious anemia developed by Dr. Leroy Coggins in the 1970s.\n\nCurrently, the US does not have an eradication program due to the low rate of incidence. However, many states require a negative Coggins test for interstate travel. In addition, most horse shows and events require a negative Coggins test. Most countries require a negative test result before allowing an imported horse into the country.\n\nHorse owners should verify that all the horses at a breeding farm and or boarding facility have a negative Coggins test before using the services of the facility. A Coggins test should be done on an annual basis. Tests every 6 months are recommended if there is increased traveling.\n"}

The island is in length, but is only wide. The New Danube waterway is practically an elongated (swimming) lake, technically a diluvian bed. It has been described as an \"autobahn for swimmers\", due to its use by people commuting to work.\n\nTo most visitors, the island is known as a recreational area with bars, restaurants and nightclubs. It has sports opportunities from rollerblading, cycling and swimming to canoeing. There is one beach that, in its beginning, felt so exotic that it was soon nicknamed the \"Copa Cagrana\" as a humoristic allusion to Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana: \"Kagran\" is the part of the 22nd District of Vienna next to that beach. In the southern and northern parts of the island, there are extensive (and free) nude beaches.\n\nThe Donauinselfest is an internationally well-known annual open air festival, and Europe's biggest event of this kind, with over 3 million visitors. It takes place at the end of June (Friday through Sunday) – except for 2008 (September 5–7), due to Austria (and Switzerland) hosting the European Football Championship. On September 23, 2008, Madonna gave her first concert in Austria there in front of a crowd of 57,000.\n\nThe main purpose of the island however is to be part of Vienna's highly sophisticated flood protection system. As the river Danube crosses the city (before major extensions: passed nearby), this has been a constant concern over hundreds of years. The first notable protective measures were taken between 1870 and 1875. A central bed, 280 m, was dug out, and an inundation area of 450 m was created at the river's left bank.\n\nIn 1970, a new plan was conceived and soon executed: digging an additional channel to replace the former inundation area, and using the spoil to build up the remaining strip of land between the straightened bed from the 19th century flood defense schemes and the newly created one. The new channel is called the Neue Donau (New Danube). After the completion of the works it was envisaged that the resulting island should eventually be used for recreation. The flood control system is designed to protect from flash floods bringing river flows of up to 14,000 m per second. This has only happened once in Vienna's history; in 1501. The heavy 2002 flood brought flows of 10,000 m per second. It includes the Danube Canal's historic Nußdorf watergate, locks at either end of New Danube, a groundwater level control system integrated into the right bank flood levee (which creates appropriate conditions for the large park area Prater, once part of a wide alluvial forest zone), and the new Freudenau river plant's sluice.\n\nThe works were started in March 1972\nand finished in 1988.\nThe river plant was added from 1992 to 1998.\n\n\n"}

It is an alternative to internal fixation, where the components used to provide stability are positioned entirely within the patient's body. It is used to stabilize bone and soft tissues at a distance from the operative or injury focus. They provide unobstructed access to the relevant skeletal and soft tissue structures for their initial assessment and also for secondary interventions needed to restore bony continuity and a functional soft tissue cover. \n\nIn this kind of reduction, holes are drilled into uninjured areas of bones around the fracture and special bolts or wires are screwed into the holes. Outside the body, a rod or a curved piece of metal with special ball-and-socket joints joins the bolts to make a rigid support. The fracture can be set in the proper anatomical configuration by adjusting the ball-and-socket joints. Since the bolts pierce the skin, proper cleaning to prevent infection at the site of surgery must be performed.\n\nInstallation of the external fixator is performed in an operating room, normally under general anesthesia. Removal of the external frame and bolts usually requires special wrenches and can be done with no anesthesia in an office visit.\n\nExternal fixation is usually used when internal fixation is contraindicated- often to treat open fractures, or as a temporary solution.\n\nExternal fixation is also used in limb lengthening. Typically, the bone is cut diagonally in a surgical procedure. External fixator pins or wires are placed on each side of the split and the external metal apparatus is used to very gradually pull the two sides of the bone apart over a long period of time. Bone will gradually grow into the small gap through distraction osteogenesis.\n\nIn most cases it may be necessary for the external fixator to be in place for many weeks or even months. Most fractures heal in between 6 and 12 weeks. However, in complicated fractures and where there are problems with the healing of the fracture this may take longer. It is known that bearing weight through fracture by walking on it, for example, with the added support of the external fixator frame actually helps fractures to heal.\n\nThe parts of an external fixator include:\n\nAlmost 2,400 years ago Hippocrates described a form of external fixation to splint a fracture of the tibia. The device consisted of closely fitting proximal and distal Egyptian leather rings connected by four wooden rods from a cornel tree.\n\nIn 1840, Jean-Francois Malgaigne described a spike driven into the tibia and held by straps to immobilise a fractured tibia. In 1843 he used a claw-like device to percutaneously hold the fragments of a fractured patella.\n\nClayton Parkhill of Denver, Colorado and Albine Lambotte of Antwerp, Belgium independently invented the modern concept of unilateral external fixation, in 1894 and 1902, respectively. Lambotte was the first to use threaded pins, however, his device necessitated initial, open fracture reduction and then pin insertion and fixator placement.\n\nIn 1938, Raoul Hoffmann of Geneva, Switzerland, building on the work of others, realized that major improvements were essential to make the external fixator more clinically relevant. He developed a technique based on closed reduction with guided percutaneous pin placement. Hoffmann’s technique exemplified the first application of minimally invasive orthopaedic surgery.\n\nIn the 1950s, Gavriil Ilizarov of Kurgan, Soviet Union, devised and developed a new method for treating fractures, deformities and other bone defects. A metal frame that encircles the limb is attached to the underlying bone by crossing (X) pins inserted through the bone and limb. The external rings are linked to each other by threaded rods and hinges that allow to move the position of the bone fragments without opening the fracture site, then the fragments can be fixed in rigid position until complete healing.\n\n\n"}

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Pogoni, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 56.693 km, the community 18.830 km. The municipal unit consists of 4 villages: Pogoniani, Dolo, Drymades, Stavroskiadi.\n\nIn antiquity the area of Pogoniani was inhabited by Molossians, one of the three main Ancient Greek tribes of the northwestern Greek group.\n\nThe establishment of the bishopric of Pogoniani is associated with the reign of Byzantine Emperor Constantine Pogonatos () due to the latter's nickname, but it first appears in the \"Notitiae Episcopatuum\" during the reign of Andronikos III Palaiologos (). The seat of the archbishop was most likely in Depalitsa (modern Molyvdoskepastos). Pogoniani fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1447.\n\nThe three-aisled Orthodox basilica of Pogoniani was erected in 1873, with donations by the local Zosimas brothers benefactors. In the late Ottoman period and until 1923, the village of Pogoniani (known as Vostina) was inhabited by Muslim Albanians alongside Orthodox Greek inhabitants. Until 1924, Muslim Albanians from the village of Pogoniani used to have close relations and exchanges with people from the town of Libohovë in Albania.\n\nDuring the period prior to the First World War the British member of the International Commission that was responsible of the delineation of the Greek-Albanian border noticed that the villages that were ceded to Albania, which consist of the northern portion of Pogoniani are entirely Greek-speaking.\n"}
{"id": "2009521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009521", "title": "Integrated library system", "text": "Integrated library system\n\nAn integrated library system (ILS), also known as a library management system (LMS),\nis an enterprise resource planning system for a library, used to track items owned, orders made, bills paid, and patrons who have borrowed.\n\nAn ILS usually comprises a relational database, software to interact with that database, and two graphical user interfaces (one for patrons, one for staff). Most ILSes separate software functions into discrete programs called modules, each of them integrated with a unified interface. Examples of modules might include:\n\n\nEach patron and item has a unique ID in the database that allows the ILS to track its activity.\n\nPrior to computerization, library tasks were performed manually and independently from one another. Selectors ordered materials with ordering slips, cataloguers manually catalogued sources and indexed them with the card catalog system (in which all bibliographic data was kept on a single index card), fines were collected by local bailiffs, and users signed books out manually, indicating their name on clue cards which were then kept at the circulation desk. Early mechanization came in 1936, when the University of Texas began using a punch card system to manage library circulation. While the punch card system allowed for more efficient tracking of loans, library services were far from being integrated, and no other library task was affected by this change.\n\nThe next big innovation came with the advent of MARC standards in the 1960s, which coincided with the growth of computer technologies – \"library automation\" was born. From this point onwards, libraries began experimenting with computers, and, starting in the late 1960s and continuing into the 1970s, bibliographic services utilizing new online technology and the shared MARC vocabulary entered the market; these included OCLC (1967), Research Libraries Group (which has since merged with OCLC), and the Washington Library Network (which became Western Library Network and is also now part of OCLC).\n\nThe 1970s can be characterized by improvements in computer storage, as well as in telecommunications. As a result of these advances, ‘turnkey systems on microcomputers,’ known more commonly as \"integrated library management systems\" (ILS) finally appeared. These systems included necessary hardware and software which allowed the connection of major circulation tasks, including circulation control and overdue notices. As the technology developed, other library tasks could be accomplished through ILS as well, including acquisition, cataloguing, reservation of titles, and monitoring of serials.\n\nWith the evolution of the Internet throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, ILSs began allowing users to more actively engage with their libraries through an OPACs and online web-based portals. Users could log into their library accounts to reserve or renew books, as well as authenticate themselves for access to library-subscribed online databases. Inevitably, during this time, the ILS market grew exponentially. By 2002, the ILS industry averaged sales of approximately US$500 million annually, compared to just US$50 million in 1982.\n\nBy the mid to late 2000s, ILS vendors had increased not only the number of services offered but also their prices, leading to some dissatisfaction among many smaller libraries. At the same time, open source ILS was in its early stages of testing. Some libraries began turning to such open source ILSs as Koha and Evergreen. Common reasons noted were to avoid vendor lock in, avoid license fees, and participate in software development. Freedom from vendors also allowed libraries to prioritize needs according to urgency, as opposed to what their vendor can offer. Libraries which have moved to open source ILS have found that vendors are now more likely to provide quality service in order to continue a partnership since they no longer have the power of owning the ILS software and tying down libraries to strict contracts. This has been the case with the SCLENDS consortium. Following the success of Evergreen for the Georgia PINES library consortium, the South Carolina State Library along with some local public libraries formed the SCLENDS consortium in order to share resources and to take advantage of the open source nature of the Evergreen ILS to meet their specific needs. By October 2011, just 2 years after SCLENDS began operations, 13 public library systems across 15 counties had already joined the consortium, in addition to the South Carolina State Library.\nLibrarytechnology.org does an annual survey of over 2,400 libraries and noted in 2008 2% of those surveyed used open source ILS, in 2009 the number increased to 8%, in 2010 12%, and in 2011 11% of the libraries polled had adopted open source ILSs. The following year's survey (published in April 2013) reported an increase to 14%, stating that \"open source ILS products, including Evergreen and Koha, continue to represent a significant portion of industry activity. Of the 794 contracts reported in the public and academic arena, 113, or 14 percent, were for support services for these open source systems.\"\n\nThe use of cloud-based library management systems has increased drastically since the rise of cloud technology started.\n\nMany modern cloud-based solutions allow automated cataloging by scanning a book's ISBN.\n\nLibrary computer systems tend to fall into two categories of software:\n\nWith distributed software the customer can choose to self-install or to have the system installed by the vendor on their own hardware. The customer can be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the application and the data, or the customer can choose to be supported by the vendor with an annual maintenance contract. Some vendors charge for upgrades to the software. Customers who subscribe to a web (hosted) service upload data to the vendor's remote server through the Internet and may pay a periodic fee to access their data.\n\nMany applications can reduce a major portion of manual data entry by populating data fields based upon the entered ISBN using MARC standards technology via the Internet.\n\nWith most software, users can eliminate some manual entry by using a bar-code scanner. Some software is designed, or can be extended with an additional module, to integrate scanner functionality. Most software vendors provide some type of scanner integration, and some print bar-code labels.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1991 the show was awarded a New York Regional Emmy for \"Outstanding Magazine Format Programming\", and \"Outstanding Issues Programming - Segments\". Later, Rosenbaum was nominated for a national Emmy Award for \"Exceptional Merrit In Nonfiction Filmmaking\" for the film \"With All Deliberate Speed'\n\nIn 1995, he created ; a half-hour show on MTV featuring first-person stories provided by viewers and curated by the show's producers. The show would typically feature content not covered by traditional media and was the first commercial use of UGC, User-Generated Content.\n\nIn 2001, while working on a shoot for Animal Planet, he witnessed the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. He directed his five film crews to Manhattan to capture the devastating aftermath of the attacks. This footage would later become the award-winning documentary \"7 Days in September\"(winner of CINE Golden Eagle and Telly Award) and go on to become a research archive of meticulously curated amateur video known as The CameraPlanet Archive The 500 Hours of 9/11 ) which Rosenbaum donated to the National 9/11 Memorial Museum.\n\nLater in 2001, he launched CameraPlanet.com; a web-based video shop that created television content and encouraged users to create their own content by providing them with tips on how to tell their own story. The site featured many categories like \"beaches\" and \"pets\" and each video featured about four minutes of footage created entirely by the users.\n\nIn 2005, he was nominated for an Emmy Award for Exceptional Merit in Nonfiction Filmmaking for his work in \"With All Deliberate Speed\" for the Discovery Channel.

{"id": "2009536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009536", "title": "Stackless Python", "text": "Stackless Python\n\nStackless Python, or Stackless, is a Python programming language interpreter, so named because it avoids depending on the C call stack for its own stack. In practice, Stackless Python uses the C stack, but the stack is cleared between function calls. The most prominent feature of Stackless is microthreads, which avoid much of the overhead associated with usual operating system threads. In addition to Python features, Stackless also adds support for coroutines, communication channels, and task serialization.\n\nWith Stackless Python, a running program is split into microthreads that are managed by the language interpreter itself, not the operating system kernel—context switching and task scheduling is done purely in the interpreter (these are thus also regarded as a form of green thread). Microthreads manage the execution of different subtasks in a program on the same CPU core. Thus, they are an alternative to event-based asynchronous programming and also avoid the overhead of using separate threads for single-core programs (because no mode switching between user mode and kernel mode needs to be done, so CPU usage can be reduced).\n\nAlthough microthreads make it easier to deal with running subtasks on a single core, Stackless Python does not remove Python's Global Interpreter Lock, nor does it use multiple threads and/or processes. So it allows only cooperative multitasking on a shared CPU and not parallelism (preemption was originally not available but is now in some form). To use multiple CPU cores, one would still need to build an interprocess communication system on top of Stackless Python processes.\n\nDue to the considerable number of changes in the source, Stackless Python cannot be installed on a preexisting Python installation as an extension or library. It is instead a complete Python distribution in itself. The majority of Stackless's features have also been implemented in PyPy, a self-hosting Python interpreter and JIT compiler.\n\nAlthough the whole Stackless is a separate distribution, its switching functionality has been successfully packaged as a CPython extension called greenlet. It is used by a number of libraries (e.g. gevent) to provide a green threading solution for CPython. Python since has received a native solution for green threads: await/async.\n\nStackless is used extensively in the implementation of the \"Eve Online\" massively multiplayer online game as well as in IronPort's mail platform.\n\n\n"}

Three years later, Bruce DuMont, founder, president, and CEO of the Museum of Broadcast Communications, assumed control of the Hall, moved its base of operations to Chicago, and incorporated it into the MBC. It has been described as being dedicated to recognizing those who have contributed to the development of the radio medium throughout its history in the United States. The NRHOF gallery was located on the second floor of the MBC, at 360 N. State St., from December 2011 until October 2017, when the traveling exhibit \"\"Saturday Night Live\": The Experience\" was installed on the second and fourth floors. In September 2018 the MBC's board of directors was reportedly close to finalizing a deal to sell the museum's third and fourth floors to Fern Hill, a real estate development and investment firm, according to Chicago media blogger Robert Feder, which would leave the MBC with just the second floor in terms of exhibit space. (After \"\"Saturday Night Live\": The Experience\" closed on March 31, 2019, the NRHOF gallery was partially restored on the second floor.)\n\nInductees to the National Radio Hall of Fame are nominated by a 24-person Nominating Committee composed of industry programming leaders and executives, industry observers and members of academia. The Nominating Committee is inclusive of commercial and public radio. Nominating Committee members serve two or three year terms on a volunteer basis. The committee receives suggestions from the industry and listening public before convening and presenting a slate of 24 nominees, 16 of which are voted upon by an industry-wide Voting Participant panel while eight others are voted on by the public. The Nominating Committee subsequently chooses up to four additional individuals for induction, choosing from suggested air personalities, programmers, management or ownership.\n\nVoting was open to the public from 2008 to 2010, then closed to public ballots from 2011 to 2014. Public voting resumed in 2015 and continues today.\n\nThe Nominating Committee recommends nominations in the following categories:\n\n\nThe online public selection of Focus on the Family's radio program for induction in the NRHOF caused gay-rights activists to protest the induction ceremony in Chicago on November 8, 2008.\n\n\"Since 2011 the public has been shut out of the Radio Hall of Fame voting process despite requirements that the steering committee consider recommendations from the public, announce multiple nominees in four categories, and conduct public voting online. Instead, the steering committee announced each year's inductees as a \"fait accompli\",\" wrote Robert Feder in June 2015 as NRHOF chairman Kraig Kitchin announced the return of public voting. In 2011 the NRHOF made headlines by inducting former U.S. president Ronald Reagan, \"whose radio career spanned only five years as a sportscaster in Iowa in the 1930s,\" Feder reported. (An August 2016 article posted on the website Chicagoland Radio and Media that centered on further controversies surrounding Bruce DuMont's personal life and his presidency of the Museum of Broadcast Communications stated that he \"finally succumbed to pressure\" when he stepped down as the NRHOF's chairman in 2014.)\n\nHoward Stern, one of the most highly rated and visible figures in radio since the 1980s, has been vocally critical of the NRHOF. He has regularly made it a focus of his jokes, lampooning the fact that the entire nomination and selection process appeared to be controlled by Bruce DuMont, the sole authority appointing the panel for the selection process. Stern has stated he would reject any offer to join the NRHOF, and further said, \"There is no Radio Hall of Fame. It's just a guy in his basement giving out awards. His name is Bruce DuMont, and he has nothing to do with radio other than the fact that his family made radios years ago.\" On June 28, 2012, Robert Feder reported that the \"most conspicuous and embarrassing omission to the Radio Hall of Fame finally will be corrected this fall when Howard Stern\" is inducted.\n\nThere are 247 inductees to the National Radio Hall of Fame with the addition of eight from the Class of 2019. A complete list can be found at the Radio Hall of Fame website.\n\n\n"}
