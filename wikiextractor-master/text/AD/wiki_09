It has an important place in traditional Malian culture and has, more recently, become a symbol of Malian cultural identity. The cloth is exported worldwide for use in fashion, fine art and decoration.\n\nThe dye technique is associated with several Malian ethnic groups, but the Bambaran version has become best known outside Mali. In the Bambara language, the word \"bògòlanfini\" is a composite of \"bɔgɔ\", meaning \"earth\" or \"mud\"; \"lan\", meaning \"with\" or \"by means of\"; and \"fini\", meaning \"cloth\". Although usually translated as \"mud cloth,\" bogolan actually refers to a clay slip with a high iron content that produces a black pigment when applied to handspun and handwoven cotton textiles.\n\nThe center of bògòlanfini production, and the source of the highest quality cloth, is the town of San.\n\nIn traditional bògòlanfini production, men weave the cloth and women dye it. On narrow looms, strips of cotton fabric about wide are woven and stitched into cloths about wide and long.\n\nThe dyeing (a \"strange and cumbersome technique\", according to the 1973 opinion of J.B. Donne) begins with a step invisible in the finished product: the cloth is soaked in a dye bath made from leaves of the \"n'gallama\" (\"Anogeissus leiocarpa\") tree that have been mashed and boiled, or soaked. Now yellow, the cloth is sun-dried and then painted with designs using a piece of metal or wood. The paint, carefully and repeatedly applied to outline the intricate motifs, is a special mud, collected from riverbeds and fermented for up to a year in a clay jar. Because of a chemical reaction between the mud and the dyed cloth, the brown color remains after the mud is washed off. Finally, the yellow \"n'gallama\" dye is removed from the unpainted parts of the cloth by applying soap or bleach, rendering the finished cloth white.\n\nAfter long use, the very dark brown color turns a variety of rich tones of brown, while the unpainted underside of the fabric retains a pale russet color.\n\nAround Mopti and Djenné, a simpler method is used by artists considered to be of inferior skill. The cloth is dyed yellow in \"wolo\" solution, made from the leaves of \"Terminalia avicennoides\", and then painted over with black designs. The yellow is either removed, producing a stark black and white design, or painted a deep orange with a solution from the bark of \"M'Peku\" (\"Lannea velutina\").\n\nBased on these simplified techniques, as of around 2000, large quantities of bògòlanfini are being mass-produced for the tourist and export markets. These fabrics use simpler designs, often applied by stencil, painted in black on a yellow or orange background. With this method, the cloth can be produced about six to seven times faster. The democratic reforms after the overthrow of Moussa Traoré in 1991 caused many young men to lose their previously guaranteed government jobs and scholarships. This led many to take up bògòlanfini production. Consequently, most cloth is now produced by men rather than women, and the traditional year-long apprenticeships have been replaced by short, informal training sessions.\n\nIn traditional Malian culture, bògòlanfini is worn by hunters and serves as camouflage, ritual protection and a badge of status. Women are wrapped in bògòlanfini after their initiation into adulthood (which includes genital cutting) and immediately after childbirth, as the cloth is believed to have the power to absorb the dangerous forces released under such circumstances.\n\nBògòlanfini patterns are rich in cultural significance, referring to historical events (such as a famous battle between a Malian warrior and the French), crocodiles (significant in Bambara mythology) or other objects, mythological concepts or proverbs. Since about 1980, Bògòlanfini has become a symbol of Malian cultural identity and is being promoted as such by the Malian government.\n\nBògòlanfini has become a popular Malian export, notably to the United States. There, it is marketed as \"mud cloth\", either as a symbol of African American culture or as a generically \"ethnic\" decorative cloth.\n\nIn Mali, the cloth is worn by people of all ethnicities, including prominently in Malian cinema and by Malian musicians, either as an expression of national or ethnic identity or as a fashion statement. Particularly popular among young people, bògòlanfini is made into a wide range of clothes, including Western miniskirts and jackets as well as traditional flowing robes (\"boubous\").\n\nThe Malian fashion designer Chris Seydou has been credited with popularizing bògòlanfini in international fashion.\n\nBògòlanfini is also produced as fine art by several Malian artists, notably by the \"Groupe Bogolan Kasobané\", six artists collaborating since 1978. These paintings are produced with vegetable dyes and mud, but often feature designs unrelated to those of traditional fabrics; their newer motifs are also often found on clothing. Other notable creators include Nakunte Diarra.\n\nTraditional bògòlanfini designs are also used for on a wide range of commercial products, such as coffee mugs, curtains, towels, sheets, book covers and wrapping paper.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2194310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194310", "title": "Sharpie (boat)", "text": "Sharpie (boat)\n\nSharpies are a type of hard chined sailboat with a flat bottom, extremely shallow draft, centreboards and straight, flaring sides. They are believed to have originated in the New Haven, Connecticut region of Long Island Sound, United States. They were traditional fishing boats used for oystering, and later appeared in other areas. With centerboards and shallow balanced rudders they are well suited to sailing in shallow tidal waters.\n\nSharpies first became popular in New Haven, Connecticut, towards the end of the 19th century. They came into use as a successor to the dugout log canoe and most likely were derived from the flatiron skiff. In an 1879 edition of Forest and Stream, a man named Goodsell claimed to have built the first sharpie with his brother in 1848 and his claim was never contested. These sharpies were typically used for oyster tonging and evolved to suit that work. They grew in popularity because they were easy to row, cheap to build and fast under sail.\n\nVarying in length, the 24–28 ft one-man boats usually had one sail, while the larger two-man boats which were around 35 ft were rigged with two sails, as cat-ketches. They had leg-o-mutton sails with sprit booms on un-stayed masts. The larger boats had three mast-steps; one at the bow, one amidships and one in between. Typically, in the summer, two masts would be stepped: one at the bow and amidships. In the winter, when heavier winds were expected, a single mast would be stepped in between. Their hulls were narrow with a large sheer and low freeboard. At the ends you will find a plumb bow with the heel of the stem sitting just out of the water and a round stern. The centerboard was long and shallow as was the balanced rudder.\n\nThe sharpie type migrated south and west to other regions where shallow water prevented deep-draft vessels from operating, including Chesapeake Bay, the Carolinas, the Great Lakes (Ohio) and Florida.\n\nAlthough most sharpies were rigged as a leg-o-mutton cat-ketch with free standing masts and sprit booms, larger versions - especially those found in the Carolinas and Florida - used stayed gaff schooner rigs which included a jib.\n\nSharpies were introduced to Florida in 1881, when Commodore Ralph Munroe brought the 33-foot New Haven style sharpie, of his own design, \"Kingfish\" to the Miami area of Florida. Perhaps the most famous of sharpies was the Commodore's \"Egret\" design, now immortalized in plans available from \"WoodenBoat\" magazine. Commodore Monroe designed \"Egret\" in 1886 and had her built on Staten Island and delivered to Key West.\n\n\"Egret\" was unique in that she had higher, flaring sides than the typical sharpie and was double-ended. This meant more stability as she was loaded and the ability to run before a following sea without waves breaking over the stern. These attributes contributed to behavior that led the Commodore to call the \"Egret\" a \"sharpie-lifeboat\".\n\nThroughout the late 19th century, the Commodore and others helped to evolve the type. Various sharpie yachts were designed by those who found the lines of working sharpies appealing. Thomas Clapham used a v-bottom in his \"Nonpareil sharpies\", and Larry Huntington introduced a rounded, arc bottom that has been used by modern designers like Bruce Kirby and Reuel Parker. Some believe the Chesapeake Bay skipjack with its v-bottom may have evolved from the early sharpies. Whatever the case, Chesapeake sharpie skiffs were common, especially in the smaller sizes, because of their easy and cheap construction.\n\nHoward I. Chapelle, a naval architect and curator of maritime history, wrote several books on traditional work boats and boat building, some of which include sharpie design and construction. He was a particular advocate of pleasure boats based on work boat models and designed many sharpie sailboats, cruisers and yachts. For a typical example of his work, see the article on a 14-foot sharpie.\n\nIn recent years, the sharpie, as with many traditional American small craft, has enjoyed renewed interest as designers and sailors have sought boats with the virtues of shallow draft and ease of construction. However, most are home-built or of one-off construction. Exceptions include Bruce Kirby's Norwalk Islands series of sharpies, Catbird 24 by Chesapeake Marine design, Johns Sharpie by Chesapeake Light Craft, Ted Brewer’s Mystic Sharpie, various designs by Parker Marine, and Phil Bolger's unique designs.\n\nLike dories, sharpies are initially tender since they have a shallow draft without a keel. They need large amounts of ballast stowed on the central floor before they become acceptable as sea boats: 600 to 900 lbs is normal in a 30 ft boat. Sharpies rely on their high flared topsides to provide stability when heeled on a reach or to windward. The twin unstayed masts makes rigging very easy and saves on cost. The unstayed flexible masts also allow wind to be spilled from the sails which helps with stability. The flat bottom, narrow water line and ample working sail means the boat is fast down wind where the flat bottom helps promote surfing or planing in stronger winds. The narrow beam, the high center of gravity, the low aspect ratio of the centre board and the longitudinal rudder shape do not help windward performance, but mostly these same features help in shallow waters or where the boat has to change direction often, such as in a tidal or rocky estuary. Cabin sharpies are an acquired taste due to the space taken up by the large central centerboard case and the restricted headroom. Even a 30-foot traditional sharpie is only suited to a maximum of 2 people when cruising for a week. A sharpie does not have the strong self-righting ability of a more conventional deep keeled yacht, so it is best suited to sheltered waters. It needs an experienced skipper who understands the foibles of the design.\n\nSharpie style hulls that are developed in New Zealand are made of plywood, use water ballast in underseat tanks that empty when trailered, vertical (dagger) ballasted boards (about 80-100 lbs) type centerboards (hoisted with a simple 4:1 block arrangement led back to the cockpit) and are commonly about 20–24 feet LOA. They are not traditionally rigged, instead having conventional fractional sloop rigs. They went through a brief period of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nDesigners such as Ian Oughtred have produced modern versions that incorporate many traditional features while addressing some of the drawbacks, in particular the replacement of the shallow, balanced rudder (which had a tendency to lead to wild and erratic steering in big following seas) with a more conventional transom-hung pivoting rudder blade. The Haiku design also has fully battened sails in an effort to improve windward performance. Oughtred offers the Haiku with either twin swinging centreboards, which give more interior room, at the expense of hydrodynamic efficiency, or a single central board, which takes up more space. At 30 feet long the Haiku is set up for a small family to cruise in sheltered waters.\n\nPhil Bolger designed a rudimentary solution to the problem of hull slap at anchor, which effects flat bottom boats, by making a 3 foot long, oval shaped anti-slap pad of multiple layers of ply about 2 inches deep, which were then rounded into a shallow arc. The noise is the same as chine slap familiar to owners of deep-V powerboats at anchor. Other designers have made the forefoot deeper so that it is immersed in the water at rest. Owners have found that putting extra weight in the bow and lowering the centreboard when anchored at night reduces the noise which is accentuated by thinner ply and lighter overall construction.\n\n\n"}

Prior to this he was a worship pastor at Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. He has written songs such as \"Eagles Wings\", \"Hear Our Praises\", \"I Give You My Heart\", \"My Redeemer Lives\" and \"Mighty to Save\", which won the Worship Song of the Year at the 40th GMA Dove Awards. In 2005 his first solo worship album, \"World Through Your Eyes\", debuted at No. 3 in the \"Australian Christian Charts\".\n\nIn 2005, Morgan signed with Rocketown Records. The company released his debut album in the United States, but four of the original songs were removed in favour of cover versions of Hillsong songs written by Morgan. In addition, the remaining songs were remixed and the resulting songs had a heavier feel when compared to the softer pop-rock originals.\n\nMorgan has toured extensively around the United States, Canada and Europe. A 2007 European tour featured events in Scotland, England, Germany and Sweden.\n\"Everyone\", contains Morgan's interpretation of his music and was mostly written in the previous 18 months, recorded in a big sounding, studio worship without the congregational elements found in the \"Hillsong Live\" albums. \"Everyone\" largely featured covers of previously released Hillsong songs written by Morgan and was released in Australia on 2 October 2006.\n\nMorgan officially became Hillsong's new worship pastor in 2008, succeeding Darlene Zschech, however, Zschech continues to be a worship leader of the Hillsong Worship Team. On 29 June 2010, Hillsong Live released \"A Beautiful Exchange\", an album featuring songs by Morgan. Morgan led Hillsong's 2010 tour of the United States, which kicked off on 21 July and included events in Dallas, Detroit and Los Angeles.\n\nMorgan's first songwriting contribution to Hillsong's live praise and worship albums was the song \"I give you my heart\", which was featured on the Hillsong live album \"God is in the House\". Morgan himself, however, did not perform on the album; the lead vocals for this performance were sung by Steve McPherson. Morgan later recorded his own interpretation of \"I give you my heart\" for his first solo album, \"World Through Your Eyes\".\n\nMorgan made his first official performing appearance on Hillsong's next live album, \"All Things are Possible\", playing acoustic guitar and contributing three original compositions to this album. One of these songs, \"Shadow of your wings\", was an outtake on the live audio recording, although it did appear on the video recording. Reuben performed co-lead vocals on the live recording of \"Shadow of your wings\" together with Darlene Zschech, although he was not credited as a vocalist for this album. His two other songwriting contributions to \"All Things are Possible\" were \"In your hands\", which was sung by Rob Eastwood and Donia Makedonez; and \"Your love\", which was sung by Miriam Webster and Lisa Young. \n\nOver time Morgan would become a prolific songwriter for Hillsongs. The next four Hillsong live albums (\"Touching Heaven Changing Earth\", \"By Your Side\", and \"You Are My World\") featured songwriting contributions and acoustic guitars from Morgan, although he did not sing lead vocals on any of these recordings. His first official credit as a vocalist was on the album \"For This Cause\". But it was not until Hillsong's 2002 live album, \"Blessed\", where he first contributed a lead vocal, which was on the track \"Most High\".\n\nThe song \"Mighty to Save\", from the 2006 Hillsong album of the same name, was written by Morgan and Ben Fielding, with lead vocals performed by Morgan. It was nominated for \"Song of the Year\" and won \"Worship Song of the Year\" at the 40th GMA Dove Awards.\n\nHe is married to Sarah and they have three children.\n\nSongs written or co-written by Morgan appear on the following albums:\n\n"}

The sundial, discovered during a renovation in 1771, commemorates the rebuilding of the ruined church, about the year 1055, by Orm, son of Gamal, whose Scandinavian names suggest that he may have been a descendant of Vikings who overran and settled this region in the late 9th century.\nThe inscription on the sundial reads as follows:\n\n(ǷFS may be an error for ǷES, though if the letters were originally painted, as seems quite possible, the E may have appeared intact. The Anglo-Saxon character represented in this transcription by '7' stands for the conjunction 'and'. Several characters in the Anglo-Saxon alphabet but no longer used in English appear in the inscriptions. Ð/ð (called 'eth')is equivalent to modern 'th', as also is þ (called 'thorn'). Ƿ (called 'wynn') is equivalent to modern 'w'; and Æ/æ (called 'ash') is here equivalent to modern 'a').\n\nThe sundial itself is inscribed\nAnd at the bottom of the central panel is the line\n\nThe reference is to Edward the Confessor and Earl Tostig, Edward's brother-in-law, who was the son of Earl Godwin of Wessex and the brother of Harold. Tostig held the Earldom of Northumbria from 1055 to 1065, fixing the date of the church's reconstruction to that decade. He is also known for the murder of Gamal, Orm's father. The language of the inscription is late Old English, with a failing case and gender system. The compound \"solmerca\" is otherwise unattested in English, and has been ascribed to Scandinavian influence (Old Norse \"solmerki\" 'sign of the zodiac').\n\nThe Historic England Web site, which lists St Gregory's as Grade I, provides the following translation of the full, three part inscription: \"Orm Gamal's son bought St. Gregory's Minster when it was all broken down and fallen and he let it be made anew from the ground to Christ and St. Gregory, in Edward's days, the king, and in Tosti's days, the Earl. This is day's Sun marker at every tide. And Haworth me wrought and Brand, priests.\" The last two sentences are more fully translated by some sources as: \"This is the day’s sun-marking at every hour. And Hawarth made me and Brand priest(s)\" \n\nThe Journal of the Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society. (Volume 69), published in 1997, offers more persuasive interpretations of the final sentence: \"First, it makes two statements: that Hawarth made the sundial (that is, he was the craftsman), and that Brand was the priest. The second interpretation is that both Hawarth (who was probably a craftsman and could have been a priest) and Brand the priest (acting as his assistant or \ninstructor), together made the sundial. Higgitt has suggested that 'Brand was \nperhaps responsible for the drafting and laying out of the text, and perhaps too \nfor the design of the sundial'.27\" (The Higgitt referred to is John Higgitt who was a medieval scholar who specialized in analyses of Anglo-Saxon inscriptions. He contributed to a 1997 Medieval Archaeology journal report, \"Kirkdale - The inscriptions\", 41. Vol 41, pp. 51-99.)\n\nPart of the sundial's historical significance is its testimony that, a century and a half after the Viking colonisation of the region, the settlers' descendants such as Orm Gamalson were now using English, not Danish or Norwegian, as the appropriate language for monumental inscriptions.\n\n\n"}

Jesus has reported that he came not to destroy the law, but fulfil it. In this verse he perhaps continues to reinforce this claim.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 5:19\n\nBoth the WEB and KJV have the prohibition refer to \"breaking\" the commandments. France feels this is incorrect as the Greek is closer to \"shall set aside one of these.\" Jesus emphasizes that the fulfillment of the commandments or the law does not mean its abolition, as the law 'remains wholly authoritative and demands the fullest respects'.\n\nThe sentence structure makes it seem as though this verse is a restatement of the last two in the importance of the Mosaic law, but some disagree. Hill notes that Jesus refers to \"these least commandments,\" but previously and throughout this gospel the law was a singular entity and is not described as a set of rules. Thus some interpret this passage as referring to the collection of rules Jesus is about to set out (the Sermon on the Mount), not the Old Testament ones called the Mosaic Law such as the Ten Commandments or Noahide Laws.\n\nHill also notes that in Jesus' time mainstream Judaism did make a distinction between lesser and greater commandments and supported the notion that the punishment for breaking a lesser one would be less than for breaking a great one. Some Jewish sects did disagree strongly with this view, however. There is some dispute about what Jesus meant by \"least in the Kingdom of Heaven.\" Schweizer feels that this phrasing is just for literary effect and that it actually means that the law breakers would be excluded from the Kingdom of Heaven. Others feel that this verse does indicate that the Kingdom of Heaven will be divided into grades and that those who break minor commandments will be allowed in, but those who break major ones will not.\n\nHill notes that some scholars have read this verse as an attack on Paul, who is generally seen to have placed less importance on Mosaic law than the author of Matthew does. Those who support this view see it as based on Paul's description of himself in , where he calls himself \"least of the apostles.\" Most scholars reject this view as there is little evidence that the author of Matthew had read Paul's works, and suggest that the Matthew passage should be read on its own terms.\n\n"}
{"id": "2194393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194393", "title": "Poster Children", "text": "Poster Children\n\nPoster Children is an American indie rock band formed at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana in 1987. They have issued eleven studio albums. Known for their strong DIY ethic, the band members continue to drive their own tour bus, create their own artwork and T-shirt designs, and operate their own record label. Poster Children were also pioneers in several forms of electronic technology relating to performance art, including enhanced CDs, webcasts, and blogs.\n\nRick Valentin and Rose Marshack met in the mid-eighties at the University of Illinois and formed several bands in rapid succession. When the two met drummer Shannon Drew in 1987, their like-minded enthusiasm sparked the beginning of a new band, dubbed Poster Children. As Valentin explained in November 1991:\nThey began selling their first album \"Toreador Squat\" on cassette and playing clubs in the Midwest. The following year, the band recorded songs with producer Iain Burgess, followed by five more songs produced with Steve Albini: the resulting album \"Flower Plower\" was released in 1989 on the Limited Potential label. It was also at this time that Poster Children picked up a second guitarist in order to complete their four-piece configuration.\n\nA major label record deal was signed with Warner Bros. Records subsidiary Reprise Records. Over the next few albums, Poster Children would be shuffled from imprint to imprint within the Warner organization. Tracks for \"Daisychain Reaction\" were recorded by Steve Albini at the Chicago Recording Company in 1990, but due to financial difficulties at the label, the album was not released until the following year. The album included Hum bassist Jeff Dimpsey on guitar.\n\nIn 1991 Rick's brother, Jim, replaced Dimpsey, and remains to this day. \"Tool of the Man\" was recorded in 1992 at Dreamland Studio in New York with John Herndon (celebrated Tortoise percussionist) on drums. \"Tool of the Man\" was also released in the UK on the Creation label. The track \"Clock Street\" was picked as their only UK single to date. \"Just Like You\" and \"Junior Citizen\" followed, with modest but consistent sales. Matt Friscia auditioned for the band in 1993 as a high school student willing to drop out to go on tour, but the band didn't want to contribute to his delinquency, and hired Howie Kantoff instead. Friscia was available again in 2001 when the band was searching for its seventh (and current) drummer.\n\nThe band was on the second stage for Lollapalooza in 1995.\n\nRick Valentin and Rose Marshack are married and have hosted the podcast \"Radio Zero\" since 1999. They both are professors in the Arts Technology program at Illinois State University.\n\nPoster Children usually write their music collectively, leaving Rick to create lyrics after the fact. During the band's formative years, they wrote and recorded with a different drummer for each album. This resulted in a fluctuating style that touched on pop punk, post hardcore, what the band refers to as \"post wave\", and new wave revival. Their music is made up of angular, overdriven guitar parts, strong basslines, and powerful yet intricate drums. The typical Poster Children song is high-energy and hard, yet melodic, and they often use unusual time signatures. Rick Valentin's lyrics are by turns witty and introspective, often obliquely related to political issues.\n\nPoster Children have not had much commercial success or industry recognition, but critics consistently describe the band as catchy, impressive, and underrated. Despite their longevity, \"the Poster Children don't have it in them to make a bad album\". The band's \"unique brand of smart pop-punk\" makes them \"definitely one of the more underrated college-rock bands to emerge in the '90s\".\n\nMarshack and the Valentin brothers have continued to work with former drummer Howie Kantoff outside of the Poster Children lineup. The four have recorded techno and electronic music under the name Salaryman. The group has released three studio albums: \"Salaryman\" (1997); \"Karoshi\" (1999); and \"The Electric Forest\" (2006).\n\nSince 2012 Rick Valentin also fronts a solo project named Thoughts Detecting Machines (TDM). Under this project he has released two EP's titled \"An Introduction to\" (2012); and \"Forget\" (2013), along with two albums \"Work the Circuits\" (2015) and \"Sound, Noise, & You\" (2019). When he performs live under this project, he places three screens vertically in front of himself onstage. The contents of each screen is provided by a camera placed behind each screen, which point at him while he plays guitar and sings along with backing tracks via laptop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Together with Breakneck Ridge on the opposite bank of the river it forms \"Wey-Gat\" or Wind Gate, the picturesque northern narrows of the Hudson Highlands. Its distinctive curved ridge is the most prominent aspect of the view south down Newburgh Bay, from Newburgh, Beacon, and the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge. It can also be seen by southbound travelers on nearby sections of the New York State Thruway. This view was a popular subject for early artists of the Hudson River School.\n\nWhile thought of as the highest point in the area, its summit reaching approximately above sea level, the eastern summit known officially as Butter Hill is actually higher, with an elevation of .\n\nDuring his initial voyage up the river, Henry Hudson and his crew named the mountain \"Klinkesberg\", due to its wrinkled rock cliffs near the river.\n\nLater, the early Dutch colonists of the region referred to the mountain simply as \"Boterberg\" (Butter Hill, since the mountain looked like a lump of butter; the English translation was later the common name for the mountain). During the middle of the 19th century, writer Nathaniel Parker Willis, who had become a resident in the region, proposed the name Storm King:\n\nThe section of New York State Route 218 that winds around the eastern slope of the mountain overlooking the River Hudson was named originally the Storm King Highway. That name is often used presently for the four-lane section of U.S. Route 9W to the west, with Route 218 referred to as the Old Storm King Highway.\n\nDuring 1962 the mountain became the topic of an when local activists formed the Scenic Hudson Preservation Coalition (known presently simply as Scenic Hudson) to fight plans by utility Consolidated Edison to cut away part of the mountain near the river and build a pumped storage hydro-electric plant complete with transmission lines across the Hudson River for an ambitious power generating scheme which would also have entailed creating a reservoir in much of what is now Black Rock Forest. In a lawsuit brought by the coalition, \"Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission\", a judge ruled for the first time that environmentalists had standing to challenge executive branch decisions in federal court. During 1979 Con Edison finally abandoned even a greatly reduced version of the project, and settled another lawsuit against their Indian Point facility by agreeing to regulate the operation of their Hudson River power plants so as to minimize the number of fish they killed and endow the Hudson River Foundation with $12 million.\n\nAfter forest fires on the mountain during the dry summer of 1999, unexploded ordnance remaining from 19th century artillery tests and training at the nearby United States Military Academy was discovered in some areas close to the trails. As a result, hiking on the mountain was prohibited until October 2002, when authorities could be sure it had been removed safely.\n\nOn February 20, 2011, a NYPD helicopter rescued two Fourth Class \"plebes\" from the United States Military Academy nearby, who had stranded themselves 500 feet up on the southern cliff face while rappelling, when a New York State Police chopper proved unable to complete the task.\n\nThe mountain is a major part of Storm King State Park. With wide views of the river and areas surrounding, both Storm King and Butter Hill summits are popular with hikers. The orange-blazed unnamed connector trail, leading to the yellow-blazed Stillman Trail, most often accessed at a parking area on U.S. Route 9W, offers an immediate and steep climb up Butter Hill followed by a longer and more relaxing hike to the summit of Storm King.\n\nAlthough attempted infrequently and not permitted by the park authorities, there are documented technical rock climbing routes above the river, as well as ice climbing, when conditions are favorable.\n\n\n"}

He won a Stanley Cup with the New Jersey Devils in 1995, and the World Cup of Hockey in 1996 playing for the United States. Rolston has represented the U.S. three times in Olympic competition for ice hockey. In the Salt Lake City Olympics of 2002, he won the silver medal. Rolston was born in Flint, Michigan, but grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Brian was most recently named to take over as head coach of the Little Caesars 2001 hockey club as well as assist with the Little Caesars 2005 team.\n\nAs a youth, Rolston played in the 1985 and 1987 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with the Detroit Compuware and Detroit Red Wings minor ice hockey teams.\n\nRolston is considered a utility forward, as he can play as a center, left wing and right wing competently. Standing 6'2' and 214 pounds in his playing days, he was best known for his highly regarded two-way ability.\n\nRolston was drafted in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils as their second pick in the first round. Prior to his NHL career, Rolston played for Lake Superior State University (where as a freshman he scored the game-winning goal and earned Most Outstanding Player honors in the National Championship game, which his team won), then the Albany River Rats of the American Hockey League (AHL). He has played for the Devils, the Minnesota Wild, the Colorado Avalanche and the Boston Bruins. Rolston was one of four players who was traded from Colorado in the 2000 deal that sent the Bruins' Ray Bourque to the Avalanche. He scored a then career-high 62 points, including nine shorthanded goals in 2001–02 with the Bruins to establish a club record. During his career, he scored a total of 33 shorthanded goals.\n\nRolston signed with the Minnesota Wild as an unrestricted free agent on July 8, 2004, though his Wild debut did not occur until the 2005–06 season due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout. Rolston often quarterbacked the Wild's powerplay (a task normally given to a defenseman) due to his booming shot from the point and strong two-way ability. During the season, he was an on-ice leader and was one of the Wild's top scorers, scoring a new career high of 79 points. He was named as team captain for Minnesota for February, October and November 2006 and January 2007. During 2006–07, Rolston scored three goals (one on a penalty shot and two in overtime shootouts), using a slapshot from the slot. He was selected for the 2006–07 NHL Western Conference All-Star Team. During the game, Rolston scored two goals and added two assists. Rolston's shot is also known for making Anaheim Ducks goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère duck for cover during a game in the 2007–08 season when Rolston fired a slapshot from the right wing aiming for the top left corner of the net. Giguère ducked to avoid being hit in the mask, resulting in a goal for Rolston. In a similar event during the 2006–07 NHL season, Rolston fired a slapshot on Vancouver Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo. The shot hit Luongo in the mask, and though unhurt, Luongo was dazed for minutes, lying on the ice until the team's trainer confirmed he was okay to continue the game. Rolston would later score on a penalty shot using his slapshot in the same game against Luongo.\n\nOn June 29, 2008, Rolston's negotiating rights were traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning in return for a conditional draft pick in 2009 or 2010. After failing to agree to a contract with the Lightning, Rolston became a free agent the next day on July 1, 2008, and signed a four-year, $20 million contract to return to the New Jersey Devils.\n\nRolston was traded to the New York Islanders for Trent Hunter. In reaction to the trade, Rolston was quoted by \"The Star Ledger\" as saying, \"It's been a bit of a rough ride in Jersey, I'm actually happy to go to a place that wants me. I just want to start new. I'm actually really happy about the change... I saw it coming. There was no blindside here. It was something we discussed from the end of the season and into the summer.\" Rolston had been waived by the Devils during the 2010–11 season, and was then entering the final year of the four-year contract he signed in 2008.\n\nAfter a poor performance on the Islanders where he only scored nine points, Rolston was traded to the Boston Bruins (along with Mike Mottau) in exchange for Yannick Riendeau and Marc Cantin.\n\nAfter 17 seasons and 1,256 career NHL games, Rolston announced his retirement from the NHL on April 30, 2013.\n\nRolston's frequent use of the slapshot became a specific subject of notoriety during his tenure with the Minnesota Wild. While Rolston was known for having an above average slapshot early in his career, his use of it on penalty shots and shootouts garnered NHL-wide attention and resulted in \"Sports Illustrated\" ranking his shot eighth all-time in March 2013, after Rolston's retirement. The advent of his unorthodox approach began after Jacques Lemaire, head coach of the Wild, mentioned to Rolston during a practice he had a dream the night before that Rolston used a slapshot in a shootout and scored. The very next day, in a game against the Vancouver Canucks, Rolston scored on a penalty shot, beating goaltender Roberto Luongo with a slapshot. After this, Rolston began to use the slapshot regularly in these situations.\n\nRolston and his wife Jennifer have four sons: Ryder, Brody, Stone and Zane. His older brother is Ron Rolston, a former coach of the Buffalo Sabres. Rolston has been a resident of Traverse City, Michigan.\n\n"}

His career encompassed soul, country, and pop. His most successful songs are 1977's \"I Go Crazy\", a #7 pop hit which once held the record for the longest chart run on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and 1982's \"'65 Love Affair\", which at #6 is his highest-charting single. Another pop hit, \"Cool Night\", was also released in 1982. In the mid-1980s, he also had two country #1 hits as a guest vocalist on songs by Marie Osmond and Tanya Tucker.\n\nPaul Davis was a member of a local group called the Six Soul Survivors around 1966 and later in another group called the Endless Chain. In 1968 he was a writer for Malaco Records, based in Jackson, Mississippi. Ilene Berns, widow of Bert Berns, signed Davis to Bang Records in 1969, and in 1970, released a cover version of The Jarmels' hit \"A Little Bit of Soap\", reaching #52 on the \"Billboard\" pop chart. His first album, \"A Little Bit of Paul Davis\", was released in 1970. In 1974, he recorded his third album, \"Ride 'Em Cowboy\", and the title track, his first top 40 single, peaked at #23 on January 18, 1975. (The same song became a Top 40 Country hit for Juice Newton in 1984.) Davis also reached #35 in September 1976 with \"Superstar\", a tribute song not related to any of the 1971 hits by that name.\n\nDavis had his first American Top 10 single with the ballad \"I Go Crazy,\" which after 30 weeks on the Hot 100 peaked at #7 on March 18, 1978. \"I Go Crazy\" spent 40 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, which at the time set the record for most weeks on the chart. The follow-up, \"Sweet Life\", also did well, peaking at #17. On May 17, 1980, his gospel-tinged \"Do Right\" peaked at #23, and Casey Kasem noted the religious aspects of this song, along with other songs before it, on that day’s edition of American Top 40. Davis was active on Bang Records when the label folded in the early 1980s.\n\nAfter one more album on the Bang label, Davis signed with Arista Records in 1981 and scored two more hits, \"Cool Night\" (which in February 1982 reached #11 on the Hot 100 and #2 on the Adult Contemporary chart) and \"'65 Love Affair\" (a Top 10 hit on both charts). His Arista debut album spawned a third hit with a remake of \"Love or Let Me Be Lonely\". The single contained a third verse of music which was not included on the album version, and despite its Top 40 and AC success, had never been reissued on any CD release until Wounded Bird reissued the \"Best of Paul Davis\" compilation in 2011. Davis retired from making records for a time, except for two duets that went to #1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart. The first was in 1986 with Marie Osmond singing \"You're Still New to Me\"; while the second, in 1988, was a collaboration with Tanya Tucker and Paul Overstreet singing \"I Won't Take Less Than Your Love\". Davis also wrote \"Meet Me in Montana\", which his friend Dan Seals and Osmond took to #1 on the \"Billboard\" country chart in 1985, and \"Bop\", a solo #1 country hit for Seals in early 1986. Davis recorded a duet with Marsha Morgan called \"Looking for a Light\" which was well received regionally in the southeast. \nBefore his death, Davis had returned to singing and songwriting by recording two songs, \"You Ain't Sweet Enough\" and \"Today\". They have not been released. Through the years, Davis was heavily influenced by technology. He owned numerous synthesizers and spent a great majority of his spare time at his home composing music that he hoped would be used in future films. Additionally, Davis was very versatile with sampling and using the Synclavier and Fairlight CMI.\n\nMany of his songs, including his best known hits, are owned by Paul McCartney through his MPL Publishing company.\n\nPaul Davis survived a shooting in Nashville, Tennessee on July 29, 1986. He was leaving a hotel on Music Row with a female companion when an unidentified man walked up, demanded his wallet, and shot him in the abdomen.\n\nDavis was an avid golfer, and was also an avid billiards enthusiast. As a member of Music City Amateur Billiard Tour in Nashville, he was competitive in the late 1990s. Additionally, his father was a preacher.\n\nDavis was once married to Pamela Gayle Jay Davis, who enjoyed a brief career with Bang Records/Web IV Music in Atlanta, GA where her husband Paul was writing and recording his songs. When their only son Jonathan was born, Pamela left her job in the music world to dedicate the following 38 years to his care, spending every day seeing to his special needs. Pamela died on March 20, 2017.\n\nDavis died of a heart attack at the Rush Foundation Hospital in Meridian, Mississippi on April 22, 2008, a day after his 60th birthday.\n\n1970-1971: Fender Rhodes electric piano, Yamaha grand piano, RMI Electra, Farfisa Organ, Hammond B-3 organ, Moog synthesizer, EMS Synth\n\n1972-1974: Minimoog, ARP 2500, ARP 2600, ARP Odyssey Mark 1, Moog Opus 6, Hammond B-3 organ, Fender Rhodes, Yamaha grand piano, EMS VCS3 Synthi\n\n1975-1976: Minimoog, ARP 2500, ARP 2600, ARP Odyssey Mark 1, Korg MiniPops drum machine, Polymoog, Fender Rhodes electric piano, Solina, EMS VCS3 Synthi\n\n1977-1979: Minimoog, Polymoog, Yamaha CS-80, Korg MiniPops drum machine, EMS VCS3, EMS Vocoder 2000, ARP 2600, ARP Odyssey, Yamaha grand piano, Hammond B-3 organ.

For 52 years from 1905 until his death, Ferguson acted as the scorer and baggageman for Australia, England, West Indies, South Africa and New Zealand in 43 tours and 208 Test matches.\n\nHe is often credited with two of the most revolutionary innovations in scoring. He developed the radial scoring chart, which shows the directions in which a batsman scored his runs. Originally called \"Ferguson's charts\", they are now popularly known as \"wagon-wheels\". He was one of the first scorers to use a linear system of scoring which, unlike the conventional system, keeps track of the balls faced by a batsman and off a particular bowler. In order to record such details, including the times of significant events during an innings, he designed his own scoring books – \"which contain[ed] at least twice as much information as any other in the world\" – and had them printed at his own expense. At the same time he also filled in a conventional scoring book for official use. He retained his own scoring books. \n\nHe received the British Empire Medal in 1951. He scored for the West Indian cricket team in England in 1957 at the beginning of the tour, but had to give up during the tour after a bad fall.

The show ended in 1940, allowing Askey to pursue a career in film and Murdoch to join the Royal Air Force. A show of the same name and starring Askey and Murdoch with Tommy Trinder was playing at the London Palladium when the Second World War broke out. The following year, another version - with Norman Evans in place of Trinder - played at the Blackpool Opera House.\n\nAn Audiobook CD, featuring extracts from the \"Band Waggon\" radio show along with other comedy recordings by Askey and Murdoch, was issued in 2006.\n\nA film version of the series was released in 1940 was produced, directed by Marcel Varnel, again featuring the double act of Arthur Askey and Richard \"Stinker\" Murdoch. The plot involves the latter pair using unorthodox methods to get their show onto the BBC and running into enemy agents at a castle in Sussex. Arthur Askey, playing himself, in his first major film role, employs his trademark catchphrase: \"I Thank You\" and songs: \"Big-Hearted Arthur\" and \"The Bee\". The film also features the music of Jack Hylton, the singing talents of Patricia Kirkwood, dancing girls and the clowning of Moore Marriott. In 1958, a television version was made, starring Askey and Murdoch, called \"Living It Up\".\n\n"}

Shaw himself was born in Dublin, yet this is one of only two plays of his where he thematically returned to his homeland, the other being \"O'Flaherty V.C.\" The play was highly successful in its day, but is rarely revived, probably because so much of the dialogue is specific to the politics of the day.\n\n\nThe play deals with Larry Doyle, originally from Ireland, but who has turned his back on his heritage to fit in with the English and Tom Broadbent, his English (and very Machiavellian) business partner. They are civil engineers who run a firm in London. They go to Roscullen, where Doyle was born, to develop some land.\n\nDoyle has no illusions about Ireland while Broadbent is taken with the romance of the place. Broadbent, a lively man who is seemingly not always aware of the impression he makes, becomes a favourite of the people. Before the play is over, it is clear he will marry Nora Reilly, the woman waiting for Doyle (who is more than happy to let her go) and become the area's candidate for Parliament after Doyle refuses to stand. Doyle has also 'called in' all his loans given \"so easily\" to the locals against their homes and intends (as he had planned all along) to make the village into an amusement park.\n\nAnother major character is the defrocked priest Peter (Father) Keegan, the political and temperamental opposite of Broadbent, who sees through him from the beginning and warns the locals against him.\n\nThe play was commissioned by W. B. Yeats for the opening of Dublin's Abbey Theatre, but Yeats rejected it as too long and too difficult to produce. He claimed that no actors were available who could do justice to the part of Broadbent. Peter Kavanagh suggests that Yeats' real reason was dislike of Shaw's style of playwrighting: \"at this time Yeats and Synge did not feel that Shaw belonged to the real Irish tradition. His plays would thus have no place in the Irish theatre movement. \"John Bull's Other Island\" was a play about Ireland but not of it. Furthermore, Shaw's plays were mostly argument, and Yeats particularly detested this quality in dramatic writing.\" Shaw himself commented the play was written at the request of \"Mr William Butler Yeats as a patriotic contribution to the Repertory of the Irish Literary Theatre. Like most people who have asked me to write plays Mr Yeats got rather more than he bargained for ... It was uncongenial to the whole spirit of the neo-Gaelic movement, which is bent on creating a new Ireland after its own ideal, whereas my play is a very uncompromising presentment of the real old Ireland.\"\n\nThe play premiered in London at the Royal Court Theatre on November 1, 1904, under the Vedrenne-Barker management. Due to its length, Barker, with Shaw's consent but not approval, cut the play somewhat. The role of Tom Broadbent was created by Louis Calvert. Dealing with the Irish question of the time, the play was seen by many major British political figures. A command performance was given for King Edward VII. He laughed so hard he broke his chair. This incident was widely reported and—after more than a decade of playwriting—Shaw's name was made in London. It was a great success and the Court would go on to produce many other Shaw plays, both old and new. In the words of T. F. Evans, \"the age of Bernard Shaw may be said to have begun\".\n\nAs popular as the play was originally, it is not one of Shaw's more revived pieces. Liz Kennedy reviewing a revival in 2004, during the New Labour government of Tony Blair, argued that the play was still relevant: \"Shaw's vision from one hundred years ago was a far-seeing one...The drama has especial contemporary resonance in this continued period of political vacuum on our own shores\" She particularly praised \"Alan Cox, giving an appropriately mannered Blairite performance as Broadbent the Englishman...he might historically be a Liberal, but he sounded very New Labour.\"\n\nGaiety Theatre, Dublin 1987: Cyril Cusack as Keegan, Marc Sinden as Broadbent, Ian McElhinney as Doyle and Kate O'Toole as Nora. Directed by Joe Dowling. Produced by Noel Pearson. Sinden took over the role five days before the first night, after the original actor broke his wrist in a fall in rehearsal.\n"}
{"id": "2194426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194426", "title": "Ghost bat", "text": "Ghost bat\n\nThe ghost bat (\"Macroderma gigas\") is a flying mammal found in northern Australia. \nThe species is the only Australian bat that preys on large vertebrates – birds, reptiles and other mammals – which they detect using acute sight and hearing, combined with echolocation, while waiting in ambush at a perch. \nThe wing membrane and bare skin is pale in colour, their fur is light or dark grey over the back and paler at the front. The species has a prominent and simple nose-leaf, their large ears are elongated and joined at lower half, and the eyes are also large and dark in colour.\nThe first description of the species was published in 1880, its recorded range has significantly contracted since that time. \nA species of \"Macroderma\", one of several genera in the family Megadermatidae (false vampires). The family all have large eyes, a nose-leaf and tragus, long ears joined at the base, and are also found in southern Asia and central Africa. The description was published in 1880 by George Dobson, emerging from an examination of specimens held by the Göttingen Museum. \nThe author compared his specimen to taxa named as species of \"Megaderma,\" identifying species \"Megaderma spasma\" (lesser false vampire bat) as the closest in resemblance. A revision of bat genera by Gerrit Smith Miller reassigned the species to a new genus \"Macroderma\", creating the current generic combination. \nThe name \"Macroderma gigas\" combines the Greek words \"macros\" (large) and \"derma\" (skin), due to the large size of their partially conjoined ears (Richards, 2012). The epithet \"gigas\" (giant) denotes it as the largest species in the family (Hudson, 1986).\nThe species \"M. gigas\" is placed with the Megadermatidae. An arrangement separating a \"Pilbara district\" population as subspecies \"Macroderma gigas saturata\" is noted as synonymous with this species concept (MSW 3rd ed., 2005).\n\nThe specimen had previously been described by Gerard Krefft in a communication to the Zoological Society of London, and had been forwarded to the Göttingen museum by Dr. Schuette. The description and illustration were presented to the society in 1879, accompanied by the suggestion that it was an unnamed genus of Phyllostomatidae (New World leaf-nosed bats); a member of the society, Edward Richard Alston, proposed instead it was a species of \"Megaderma\" which were unknown in Australia. The type locality is at the Wilson River near Mt Margaret in Queensland, where the collector, also named Wilson, obtained the bat. An earlier observation had been noted by Robert Austin in 1854 at Mount Kenneth while surveying the inland regions of Western Australia.\n\nStudies of brain structures indicate that \"Macroderma gigas\" is an intermediate and divergent species of the insectivorous microchiropterans and the carnivorous species from South America.\n\nCommon names that refer to \"Macroderma gigas\" have included ghost bat, false vampire, false vampire bat, and Australian false vampire bat. The name ghost bat derives from its distinct colouring, the predominant colour of its fur may be near white or pale grey.\n\nA larger species of microchiropterans (microbats) and the largest in Australia, the size is comparable the megabat species (flying fox, fruitbat). The fur colour is grey, ranging in tone from mid, sometimes dark, to very pale grey at the back and whitish at the ventral side and head, The colour of populations is a geographic cline, becoming darker toward the coastal regions. A ring at the eye is dark. and colour of the wing membranes and other bare skin is pale and brownish. The interfemoral membrane extends the wing surface between the length of the legs. The great length of the ear, from notch at head to tip, is 44 to 56 millimetres and they are fluted in form; the inner margins of the ears are fused for half their length.\nThe length of the prominent ears is twice that of the head, a seam at the inner margins stiffens these to keep them upright while in flight.\nOther measurements of the species are a 96 to 112 mm range for the forearm length, 98 to 120 mm for the combined length of the head and body, and a weight range of 75 to 145 grams, averaging as 105 g across the sampled specimens.\n\nThe eyes are comparatively large and well developed for nocturnal vision, a feature shared with the long-eared genera \"Nyctophilus\". The nose-leaf is also large and prominent, and simple in form. The nasal appendage is presumably similar in usage to the elaborate forms of the horse-shoe and leaf-nosed bat genera, manipulating, directing and receiving echolocation signals to detect prey. The lack of a tail, effectively absent, is a characteristic of the species. The membrane at the rear is, however, supported by a calcar at the ankle. The teeth and short robust jaw allow the consumption of a wide variety of animals, either the flesh and bones of other vertebrate species or hard shells of larger invertebrates. A pregnant bat possesses two sets of teats, one pair beneath the armpits provide milk from the mammary glands and another pair at the pubic area. The pubic teats do not have a lactational function, rather they act as purchase points for the new-born to be carried in flight by the mother.\n\nThe voice is audible to humans, one sound resembles the avian species \"Petrochelidon ariel\" (fairy martin) and transliterated as 'dirrup dirrup'. This twittering call is given when the bat is excited or before leaving the roost to feed. A chirp uttered by the species resembles crickets. The species is generally quiet, but some vocalisation is known in captivity when a squealing sound accompanies a squabble over food. The twittering sound was reported in captivity as hunger, and young will continually emit a chirp when the mother is absent.\nAlthough \"Macroderma gigas\" is inactive during daylight hours, they do not hibernate. The colony size reduces in the austral winter, increasing when they gather to breed or females form maternity groups.\n\nThey leave the roost several hours after sunset, alone, in pairs, or as small groups. Hunting occurs via a 'sit and wait' technique while suspended from a tree or as low surveys over vegetation. The large ears allow the bat to hear prey moving on the ground. Field observations at Pine Creek using nightscope equipment reported seeing \"M. gigas\" suspended from a tree and dropping to catch large locusts detected moving through grass at ten to twenty metres distance. They are also able to detect the echolocation signals of the microbats on which they prey. The bat has good vision for a microchiropteran, and echolocation is also utilised to directly locate approaching prey. They are able to visually locate birds roosting in trees, and budgerigars (\"Melopsittacus undulatus\") are detected by their silhouettes against the evening light. The budgie is a favoured food of the bat, which they detect by the flock's chatter while retiring for the night, and these are taken to a perch to be consumed head first; the feet and wing parts are discarded while butchering the bird.\n\nPrey may be taken at or to the ground, where it is enveloped with the wings and killed with bites to the neck. The sharp teeth and strong jaws are able to subdue animals as large as the bar-shouldered dove, species \"Geopelia humeralis\", that may weigh as much as 150 grams, although most prey is smaller. Bird and mammal remains are most frequently recorded in their scats. Once located, an animal is held down via the thumb claws and killed by a single bite to the neck. The prey is killed at the ground or in flight, and taken to a perch to be consumed, feeding may be at an overhanging rock or smaller cave for this purpose.\nThe family Megadermatidae is carnivorous, feeding on animals that includes vertebrate species, and this species commonly feeds on arthropod, mammalian, amphibian and reptilian prey. These include large insects and small mice, other bats, small birds, frogs, Pygopodidae (legless lizards), geckos and snakes. \"Macroderma gigas\" is formally referred to as a specialised carnivore, but they have been known to feed on insects if prey is scarce. Vertebrate prey is eaten much more frequently, and is usually consumed at the site of capture. Other species of microbats are taken in flight, these include species of sheathtails, bentwings or horseshoe bats and little cave eptesicus.\n\nA study of the avian prey of the bat revealed that over fifty species of birds are targeted, in a range of sizes but a preference for those weighing less than 35 grams. Birds that roost in flocks make up a large part of the diet, and a quarter of the species are non-passerines. One nocturnal species of bird is recorded at their middens, the Australian owlet-nightjar \"Aegotheles cristatus\". The examination of the butchered remains of their middens has given support to interpretation of fossil depositions, that have similar assemblages of discarded remains, at the Riversleigh formations where this and other species of \"Macroderma\" are exceptionally well represented.\n\nField workers report that the species is remarkably passive when handled. Other workers have recorded and confirmed reports of \"Macroderma gigas\" preying on rodents caught in their pitfall traps.\n\nThe ghost bat is endemic to Australia. Three population centres are identified, the Northern Pilbara and Kimberley in Western Australia, the Top End of the continent and in Queensland. The distribution of colonies is non-contiguous, and they usually occur in small isolated pockets within each region. Analysis of fossil remains shows that distribution patterns within Australia changed, in waves of both expansion and contraction, and the probable cause was ecological changes resulting from the increasing aridity of the continent's climate. Little is known of the genetics of the ghost bat, although research into population indicates is highly structured. The colonies shows a high degree of genetic distinctiveness at a local and regional level.\n\nThe southernmost record is Austin's 1854 note at Mt Kenneth. A limestone cave site favoured by \"M. gigas\" is in the region of the Mitchell and Palmer rivers at Cape York. They are occur around Shoalwater Bay at the east coast. \nThe species is well represented at Litchfield National Park, which provides important caves and habitat for a number of bat species in the northern regions near Darwin. \nThe largest recorded breeding colony of \"M. gigas\" is at a gold mine named Kohinoor at the Top End. The mine was dug in the late nineteenth century and later occupied as a creche when it became unprofitable, however, it remains on a lease that may be profitable as an open-cut operation. \nAnother well known breeding site is found at Nourlangie Rock in Kakadu National Park, a region that is protected by conservation. It is also recorded in national parks at Mount Etna Caves NP and at Tunnel Creek where they cohabit with other bat species. Small colonies have been recorded along the Victoria River and at Camooweal Caves NP. The range extends in association with rocky cliffs, gorges, or outcrops along watercourses in the Kimberley region of northwest Australia.\n\nBuilt environments may be used as feeding grounds, but the ghost bat selects daytime roosts in caves, sheltered rock crevices, boulder piles or disused mines; occupation of abandoned buildings is only occasionally reported. A preference is given to sites with a complex of shafts or cavities and several openings to the outside. \"Macroderma gigas\" favours these caves with multiple entrance ways as they are large enough to accommodate the greater wingspan of the species and allow an alternative exit when sensing a threat. They require several suitable sites for rest, feeding and reproduction, and change locations seasonally. The species is especially sensitive to disturbance by humans, and this contributes to the selection or abandonment of a roost site.\n\nThe bat and the caves they occupied were well known to peoples of Australia, often informing field workers of their locations in central Australia; some sites were part of 'men's business' that imparted a story of the being to young initiates.\n\n\"Macroderma gigas\" is present in the fossil record of Australia and found at the Riversleigh World Heritage Area. The species was sympatric with others of the genus at Riversleigh. such as \"Macroderma malugara\", and is the modern representative of a lineage that extends to at least the early Miocene epoch.\n\nThe ghost bat was once widely distributed throughout Australia, and became restricted to a sparser population across northern regions. The species was recorded three more times in the twenty years that followed its discovery, two at Alice Springs and one in the Pilbrara. Attempts to survey the distribution range began in 1961, when its earlier status as a relict and rare species was revised to indicate it was more widespread and disappearing in regions where it was known within living memory; Hedley Finlayson interviewed Pitjanjarra elders (Anangu people) who knew of the species in the Musgrave, Mann and Tomkinson Ranges and not seen for forty years.\nThe species had been observed across the central regions of Australia, and the desiccated remains have been found on cave floors in the Flinders Ranges. The skeletons have also been recorded in caves of the coast in the southwest of Australia. The range is now limited to regions near the coast and north of the Tropic of Capricorn.\n\nResearchers have noted the lack evidence for the species in former range, and the contraction to the north both before and after European settlement has been investigated. There are isolated congregations of bats in specified maternity sites in which the alleles expressed by the females are distinguishable; this implies that the separation of such populations extends through evolutionary time. This scattering into small sets of populations greatly raises the threat of extinction to the species.\n\nIt is estimated that several thousand ghost bats remain in existence today. Declines in population are expected to be reversed in part because of increased survival rates, not because of immigration from other isolated areas. There are very few national parks that strive to protect the species at this time. The decline has been correlated to the increasing range of the amphibian species \"Rhinella marina\" (\"Bufo marinus\"), known locally as the cane toad. Investigations of recorded sites found the bat absent when the toad reached their local habitat, combined with the evidence of occasional consumption and—in one example—found in the throat of a deceased bat, the advance of the cane toad is strongly implicated as the cause of their rapid decline.\n\nDuring the breeding season, late October to early November, female bats congregate in groups and give birth to a single young. The generation length is estimated at four years. According to a study conducted on range of ghost bats in Australia, “female bats gave birth to a single young in late spring, but only 40% of females bred in their second year, increasing to 93% for females greater than 2 years old”.\n\nMaternity colonies are founded in large and open caves and occupied until the young are reared. The teats are evident in females during the maternity season. The possession of anterior teats allows the new born to cling to the mother until the milk teeth are shed. The young are born in the austral spring, are able to fly after seven weeks, and become fully weaned at sixteen weeks. As is the norm for microbats, only one young is produced by the mother. The males play no part in the rearing of young. The juvenile hunts with the mother until reaching an independent stage of its maturity.\n\nThe associated species include the black flying fox \"Pteropus alecto\", recorded at Tunnel Creek in the Kimberley. A new species of parasite, the tick \"Argas macrodermae\", was discovered on specimens of \"M. gigas\", but as a microchiropteran is remarkably free of external parasitic organisms. The only record as host to an endoparasite is the filarial nematode species \"Josefilaria mackerrasae\", described from specimens found on \"M. gigas\" in 1979.\n\n\"Macroderma gigas\" has few predators, and most competition of their nocturnal hunts is from medium-sized owls (Strigidae). They will join other predators at a cave mouth where other bat species will exit, this example of multiple species feasting together with other carnivores is intensified in the season when young bats are emerging from their creche. These congregations include introduced species, cane toad \"Rhinella marina\", feral cats and foxes, and natives such as pythons, birds of prey, quolls and large frogs of genus \"Litoria\".\n\nThe bat will often take prey to a feeding roost, where a midden is formed from the discarded remains. The range of a species of skink, found in the Northern Territory, was extended to Queensland by a record at a feeding roost of \"M. gigas\".\n\nThe species is vulnerable to several anthropogenic hazards, one is barbed wire fencing that accounts for many deaths when they are snagged through the easily torn wing membrane while in flight. The damage caused by the barbed wire strands, often left littering their environment, is greatly increased as the individual become entangled as it attempts to dislodge itself. A study in the Pilbara region identified this as an especial concern, with indications that barbed wire was significantly impacting local populations when erected. The foraging height of \"M. gigas\" is around that of the dominant \"Triodia\" (spinifex) vegetation and the species is unable to visually detect the wire strand, and is not thought to use echolocation to forage in flight. The thorny and tangled introduced plant lantana also presents a similar hazard to bats. They are especially sensitive to disturbance in wintering roosts, and a single fleeting visit will see the site deserted for several weeks or altogether if human activity continues. Most bat species are vulnerable to human disturbance, but attempts to view \"M. gigas\" at their roosts are especially discouraged due to the rapid decline in range and population. New or reopened mining operations may have an impact on local colonies, although they may provide diurnal roosts when complete; they are vulnerable to dilapidation in former mines such as the collapse of ceilings.\n\nThe conservation status of \"Macroderma gigas\" includes listings of state or federal authorities and non-governmental organisations. The Queensland and South Australian state registers note the species as endangered and in Western Australia it is classified as vulnerable to threatening factors. The federal classification is vulnerable under the EPBC act 1999. Despite a well documented decline, the relevant criteria of legislation was not found to support a relisting of their status as endangered without analysis of genetic variation in the population. The relevant non statuary bodies, IUCN and \"The action plan for Australian mammals\" (2012), also list this species as vulnerable to extinction. The population estimate at the IUCN Red List (2019) is between four and six thousand mature individuals in total. The state population of Queensland is less than one thousand, and the large colony at Mt Etna has gone into decline. The Kohinoor maternity colony at the Top End is stable but vulnerable to mine collapse. The western populations are more numerous in the Kimberley, three to four thousand, and the Pilbara group is estimated at less than six hundred.\n\n"}

Originally designating a single permanent marker, the Sharpie brand has been widely expanded and can now be found on a variety of previously unrelated permanent and non-permanent pens and markers formerly marketed under other brands. This article focuses on the legacy Sharpie permanent marker line.\n\nSharpie markers are made with several tips. The most common and popular is the Fine tip. Other tips include Ultra Fine Point, Extra Fine Point, Brush tip, Chisel tip, and Retractable tip.\n\n\"Sharpie\" was originally a name designating a permanent marker launched in 1964 by the Sanford Ink Company (established in 1857). The Sharpie also became the first pen-style permanent marker.\n\nIn 1990, Sharpie was acquired by The Newell Companies (later Newell Rubbermaid) as part of Sanford, a leading manufacturer and marketer of writing instruments.\n\nIn 2005, the company's popular Accent highlighter brand was repositioned under the Sharpie brand name. A new version of Sharpie called Sharpie Mini was launched, which are markers half the size of a normal Sharpie and feature a clip to attach the Sharpie to a keychain or lanyard. In 2006, Sharpie released a new line of markers that had a button-activated retractable tip rather than a cap. Sharpie Paint markers were also introduced. As of 2011, 200 million Sharpies had been sold worldwide. Sharpie markers are manufactured in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico and Maryville, TN, and with numerous off-shore partners globally.\n\nSharpie sponsored the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Sharpie 500, a popular night-time race at Bristol Motor Speedway, from 2001 through 2009. For the 2010 season, Newell Rubbermaid switched the sponsorship for this race to its Irwin Tools brand. Sharpie sponsored the Nationwide Series Sharpie Mini 300 race from 2004 to 2008. Before 2006, they sponsored Kurt Busch, who was the 2004 Sprint Cup champion. Sharpie also sponsored Jamie McMurray in the 2006 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.\n\nIn recent years, Sharpie commercials have followed the slogan \"Write Out Loud\". These advertisements depict people using Sharpies in bad situations, such as using the marker to touch up a car and a college woman highlighting words in a book to notify a male student that his fly was open. Also, a middle-aged woman trying to think of what to write for her resignation letter, writes \"I QUIT\" with a red Sharpie. David Beckham is sponsored by Sharpie and appears in a commercial signing autograph with a Sharpie and trying to steal them.\n\nHand sanitizer and acetone based nail polish remover are said to be effective on permanent markers. Sharpie official FAQ suggests trying a product called Amodex stain remover. Though Sharpie ink will become mostly permanent after setting, it can be erased. A dry erase marker is usually successful in removing sharpie ink by covering the sharpie ink using three to four pen strokes. \n\nSharpie ink that has dried for more than several hours can be removed with acetone and other ketones and esters, such as ethyl acetate, but acetone and other organic solvents may damage the surface of the material written upon. Isopropyl alcohol works well and is less damaging to some surfaces; rubbing alcohol is the dilute form, so it works more slowly. On some surfaces, the ink can be removed by coloring over the ink with a dry erase marker (since this marker's ink contains organic solvents) and then removing the Sharpie ink and dry erase marker ink with a dry cloth. Steam cleaning has proved effective, as have rubber erasers. Magic Eraser has also proven somewhat effective on hard surfaces such as brick and very effective on wood furniture. On non-porous surfaces, denatured alcohol is the most effective solvent for the removal of Sharpie ink, and it is safe for use on most plastics.\n\nThere are no warning labels on Sharpie markers. They bear the new AP (Approved Product) certification symbol of The Art & Creative Materials Institute, Inc. (ACMI). According to the organization:\n\"The new AP (Approved Product) Seal, with or without Performance Certification, identifies art materials that are safe and that are certified in a toxicological evaluation by a medical expert to contain no materials in sufficient quantities to be toxic or injurious to humans, including children, or to cause acute or chronic health problems. (Sanford LP became a member of ACMI in 1986) However, this does not mean that materials are not irritants or allergens. Such products are certified by ACMI to be labeled by the chronic hazard labeling standard, ASTM D 4236, and the U.S. Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act (LHAMA).\"\nThey are considered non-toxic for \"normal uses\", meaning writing on posters, soccer balls and such. Sharpie is not meant for the skin but is not dangerous with incidental exposure.\n\nDuring an October 14, 2002 National Football League Monday Night Football game against the Seattle Seahawks, San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Terrell Owens pulled a black Sharpie marker out of his sock to sign the football he caught to score a touchdown and then gave the ball to his financial adviser, who was in the stands. The touchdown celebration would bring a resurgence to the NFL for new and innovative ways to celebrate touchdowns. It has commonly been referred to by sports fans as \"The Sharpie Incident\" or \"The Sharpie Touchdown\".\n\nSpecial Camp David Sharpies were made for United States President George W. Bush, who has long been loyal to the brand.\n\nSharpie markers are favored by illustrator Adam Hughes for inking large areas in his convention sketches.\n\nSharpies are the writing utensil of choice by astronauts aboard the International Space Station because of their usability in zero-gravity. According to Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who commanded the International Space Station in 2012–2013, \"you can hold it any which way and it still works\".\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump has a well-known preference for using Sharpies to sign official government documents. \n\nIn September 2019, Trump was involved in a \"Sharpie-gate\" controversy, in which - as CNN reports: \"Trump defended an apparent Sharpie-altered map of Hurricane Dorian's predicted path.\"\n\n"}

Astatke led his band while playing vibraphone and conga drums—instruments that he introduced into Ethiopian popular music—as well as other percussion instruments, keyboards, and organ. His albums focus primarily on instrumental music, and Mulatu appears on all three known albums of instrumentals that were released during Ethiopian Golden 1970s.\n\nMulatu's family sent the young Mulatu to learn engineering in Wales during the late 1950s. Instead, he began his education at Lindisfarne College near Wrexham before earning a degree in music through studies at the Trinity College of Music in London. He collaborated with jazz vocalist and percussionist Frank Holder. In the 1960s, Mulatu moved to the United States to enroll at Berklee College of Music in Boston. He studied vibraphone and percussion.\n\nWhile living in the U.S., Mulatu became interested in Latin jazz and recorded his first two albums, \"Afro-Latin Soul, Volumes 1 & 2\", in New York City in 1966. The records prominently feature Mulatu's vibraphone, backed by piano and congas playing Latin rhythms, and were entirely instrumental with the exception of the song \"I Faram Gami I Faram,\" which was sung in Spanish.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Mulatu brought his new sound, which he called Ethio-jazz, back to his homeland while continuing to work in the U.S. He collaborated with many notable artists in both countries, arranging and playing on recordings by Mahmoud Ahmed, and appearing as a special guest with Duke Ellington and his band during a tour of Ethiopia in 1973.\n\nMulatu recorded \"Mulatu of Ethiopia\" (1972) in New York City, but most of his music was released by Amha Eshete's label Amha Records in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, including several singles, his album \"Yekatit Ethio Jazz\" (1974), and six out of the ten tracks on the compilation album \"Ethiopian Modern Instrumentals Hits\". \"Yekatit Ethio Jazz\" combined traditional Ethiopian music with American jazz, funk, and soul.\n\nBy 1975, Amha Records had ceased production after the Derg military junta forced the label's owner to flee the country. Mulatu remained to play vibes for Hailu Mergia and the Walias Band's 1977 album \"Tche Belew\" (which included \"Musicawi Silt\") before the Walias also left Ethiopia to tour internationally. By the 1980s, Mulatu's music was largely forgotten outside of his homeland.\n\nIn the early 1990s, many record collectors rediscovered the music of Mulatu Astatke and were combing stashes of vinyl for copies of his 70s releases. In 1998, the Parisian record label Buda Musique began to reissue many of the Amha-era Ethio-jazz recordings on compact disc as part of the series \"Éthiopiques\", and the first of these reissues to be dedicated to a single musician was \"Éthiopiques Volume 4: Ethio Jazz & Musique Instrumentale, 1969–1974\". The album brought Mulatu's music to an international audience.\n\nMulatu's music has had an influence on other musicians from the Horn region, such as K'naan. His Western audience increased when the film \"Broken Flowers\" (2005) directed by Jim Jarmusch featured seven of his songs, including one performed by Cambodian-American rock band Dengue Fever. National Public Radio used his instrumentals as beds under or between pieces, notably on the program \"This American Life\". Samples of his were used by Nas, Damian Marley, Kanye West, Cut Chemist, Quantic, Madlib, and Oddisee.\n\nAfter meeting the Massachusetts-based Either/Orchestra in Addis Ababa in 2004, Mulatu began a collaboration with the band beginning with performances in Scandinavia in summer 2006 and London, New York, Germany, Holland, Glastonbury (UK), Dublin, and Toronto in 2008. In the fall of 2008, he collaborated with the London-based collective The Heliocentrics on the album \"Inspiration Information Vol. 3\", which included re-workings of his Ethio-jazz classics with new material by the Heliocentrics and himself.\n\nIn 2008, he completed a Radcliffe Institute Fellowship at Harvard University where he worked on modernization of traditional Ethiopian instruments and premiered a portion of a new opera, \"The Yared Opera\". He served as an Abramowitz Artist-in-Residence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, giving lectures and workshops and advising MIT Media Lab on creating a modern version of the krar, a traditional Ethiopian instrument.\n\nOn 1 February 2009, Mulatu performed at the Luckman Auditorium in Los Angeles with a band that included Bennie Maupin, Azar Lawrence, and Phil Ranelin. He released a two-disc compilation album to be sold exclusively to passengers of Ethiopian Airlines, with the first disc containing a compilation of styles from different regions of Ethiopia and the second consisting of studio originals. On 12 May 2012, he received an honorary doctor of music degree from the Berklee College of Music.\n\nIn 2015, Mulatu began recording with Black Jesus Experience for \"Cradle of Humanity\", which premiered at the Melbourne Jazz Festival in 2016 and was followed by a tour of Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2194446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194446", "title": "Lancaster and Chester Railroad", "text": "Lancaster and Chester Railroad\n\nThe Lancaster and Chester Railroad or L&C is a railway headquartered in Lancaster, South Carolina. The original route connects Lancaster in Lancaster County with Chester in Chester County. The line's nickname is The Springmaid Line, which refers to its original purpose of connecting the plants of the Springs Mills company.\n\nIn 1873, the Cheraw and Chester Railroad Company was granted a charter by a Special Act of the South Carolina General Assembly \"to construct a railroad from Cheraw, in Chesterfield County, to Chesterville, in Chester County, by such route as shall be found most suitable and advantageous\".\n\nIn those days, railroads were often built in sections using different contractors and money sometimes ran out before the line was tied together. This happened to the narrow gauge Cheraw and Chester. In 1879, it made it the from Chester County to the Catawba River but did not cross it. On the other end, rail was laid from Cheraw to Pageland before the capital was exhausted in that direction. It operated for three years in these sections before being split. The Chester section was leased to the Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta Railroad, which built a wooden bridge across the Catawba and extended the track beyond Lancaster in 1883. It was then leased to the Richmond and Danville Railroad, which in turn went into receivership. Meanwhile, the line from Cheraw to Pageland became the Chesterfield and Lancaster Railroad but never extended any further.\n\nThe receivers for the Richmond and Danville operated the line from Lancaster to Lenoir as one railroad but neglected to pay expenses. It soon returned the Cheraw and Chester to its stockholders.\n\nTwo years later, in 1896, the railroad was sold by court order at an advertised auction for $25,000 to satisfy its debts. Its buyer, Colonel Leroy Springs, renamed the line the Lancaster and Chester Railroad and organized a company to run it.\n\nIn addition to Leroy Springs, the incorporators of the new railroad were William Ganson, R. C. McManus, W. T. Gregory, L. C. Payseur, James M. Heath and W. H. Hardin. All of the men were from Lancaster save for Hardin, who was from Chester. The capital stock of the company was $50,000. On June 22, 1896, Hardin, also manager of the Chesterville and Lenoir, was elected manager and auditor of the line.\n\nSprings did not have any personal experience in the railroad business. His interest in purchasing the line may have stemmed in part from the fact that his father, Andrew Baxter Springs, had been one of the contractors and directors for the Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta Railroad, which helped form the towns of Rock Hill and Fort Mill, South Carolina. His grandfather, John Springs III, had been an early investor of the South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company, the nation's first operating railroad, and had the privilege of having one of its early engines named after him in the days when engines were named instead of numbered. Springs' brother was president of the Atlantic, Tennessee and Ohio Railroad (AT&O) that proceeded from Charlotte to Taylorsville before it ran out of capital. When he would refer to the AT&O in front of fellow businessmen, Springs would claim to be president of the Lancaster, Klondike and Manila Western Railroad.\n\nAlthough the railroad business as a whole was not prosperous, the newly created L&C did not have to look far for business. Springs had recently completed a textile mill in Lancaster to go with the mills he already owned in Chester, all of which supplied traffic to the railroad. Other businesses in both towns were also served by the L&C. The line connected with the Southern Railway at both ends; with Carolina and Northwestern Railway (itself later part of Southern) at Chester; and with Seaboard Air Line at Fort Lawn.\n\nIn 1899, both the Catawba River Trestle and Lancaster Depot burned a few months apart from one another. The cost to replace both structures nearly equaled what Springs and his associates paid for the railway three years earlier. However, this misfortune did allow the line an opportunity to upgrade by building a steel trestle to replace the original wooden one.\n\nFor the first six years of its existence, the Lancaster and Chester Railroad had the distinct disadvantage of being a narrow gauge railroad. Thus, it was impossible to exchange cars with the main lines, which were . Freight had to be unloaded from the main line cars in Lancaster or Chester and reloaded onto the smaller L&C cars and vice versa. Also, the L&C engines had to burn wood because the coal mines were on standard gauge lines and it was not economical to reload the coal on to smaller cars.\n\nIn 1902, Springs borrowed $125,000 from the Southern Railway to convert the L&C rails to standard gauge. The railway also bought new coal burning locomotives as well as new rail cars. The East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad purchased the old rolling stock from the L&C. By 1913, the L&C owned three steam locomotives, nineteen box cars, two coal cars, two passenger cars, and two combines. Capital stock had risen from $50,000 to $500,000.\n\nThen as now, odd-numbered trains ran eastbound and even-numbered trains ran westbound, against traditional railroad operating procedure. This is because before Springs bought the railroad, trains ran through from points north of Chester. Thus, they started their runs as southbound trains which, like westbound trains, normally have odd-digit numbers. They kept their odd numbers all the way to Lancaster on the Chester and Cheraw, even after they turned east at Chester.\n\nLater that year, the Lancaster and Chester was persuaded to run a special passenger train to carry fans to a baseball series in Chester County between Chester and Dillon. There were as many passengers on that one train as the L&C ordinarily carried in an entire year. To make the most of the trip, several empty coal cars were attached in front of the passenger cars. When the train reached the Hooper Creek Trestle, one of the hopper cars derailed, taking the three coaches into the creek below. Every person aboard was badly shaken or injured, and five lives were lost.\n\nThe seventy-one personal injury claims totaled more than $130,000, nearly causing the L&C to go bankrupt. Two weeks after the Hooper Creek derailment, a fire destroyed the Lancaster Depot, which also served as a warehouse for the mill, costing the railway an additional $75,000. It took Springs two years to emerge from the courthouse with his railroad intact. He then was able to borrow enough money to get the line operating again.\n\nIn 1916, a hurricane-generated flood washed away the three-span Catawba River Trestle as well as the Cane Creek Trestle near the Lancaster Plant. For weeks, the L&C detoured over the Southern line to Catawba Junction and the Seaboard line to Fort Lawn to connect with its own line. A ferry was then built to take the place of the trestle, but this proved to be both slow and expensive.\n\nA new trestle would have cost $90,000, more than the railroad was worth before the old trestle was lost. The Southern Railway was not interested in taking the railroad back and building a new trestle. For a year, the option of abandoning operations and taking up the rails to sell for scrap was considered.\n\nSprings then heard of a main-line trestle that was about to be abandoned by the railroad that owned it so they could replace it with a trestle that had double tracks. The trestle also included a bridge for automobiles. Colonel Springs bought this trestle and then sold it to the county for what he had paid for it. He was left with only the expense of moving the trestle to the Catawba and attaching it to the stone piers of the old trestle that were spared by the flood. The new trestle fit the piers of the old one.\n\nThe Lancaster and Chester resumed operations just in time to be taken over by the government during World War I.\n\nSprings died in April 1931 leaving his empire to his only child, Elliott White Springs. Elliott Springs was born just weeks after his father purchased the L&C and had a genuine love for the railway. Under his leadership, the L&C began to prosper in the latter part of that decade, on the eve of the Second World War. In 1939, he brought the L&C national attention when he purchased the Loretto, a rail car that had originally been built for the former president of U.S. Steel, Charles M. Schwab. Springs carefully preserved the splendor of the forty-year-old car's Victorian design—Cuban mahogany paneling, crystal chandelier, velvet draperies, marble bath, and gold-plated beds. He had the Loretto remodeled for office use, then parked it on a siding near the White homestead in Fort Mill.\n\n, the Loretto on display at the North Carolina Transportation Museum in Spencer, North Carolina.\n\nSprings had a flair for colorful advertising. One of the things he remains best remembered for is the menu he wrote and printed for the L&C dining car. This menu included: Long Island Ugly Duckling stuffed with Turnip Greens and Pearl Onions, Cannibal Sandwich with real collar buttons, Pork Barrel stuffed with Republican, Drawn and Quartered Democrat Roasted in Own Jacket, and Elliott Springs with Garlic and Chlorophyll. Also offered were an alligator pear for one dollar and a pair of alligators for two dollars. Dessert was watermelon Jane Russell, pitted grapes and potted dates. That the L&C did not actually own a dining car at the time did not matter.\n\nSprings rarely did anything in a small way and usually had fun doing it. It was his idea to appoint 29 vice-presidents to the railway, one for each mile of track. They included playwright Charles MacArthur, golfer Bobby Jones, artist James Montgomery Flagg, writer Lucius Beebe, radio man Lowell Thomas and his wartime friends Billy Bishop and Clayton Knight. Another one of these fictional vice-presidents was Ham Fisher, who seldom drew a freight train in his Joe Palooka strip without labeling it Lancaster and Chester.\nHowever, it was striptease artist Gypsy Rose Lee, named vice-president in charge of unveiling, who got the most attention. Lee was brought to the attention of Springs by his friend, Agnew Bahnson of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She was a devoted fan of the rails and kept models of famous trains in her basement.\n\nIn addition to providing menus for dining cars that did not exist and the naming of the colorful vice-presidents, Springs listed a timetable for trains that likewise did not exist. They included The Shrinking Violet, The Black Label, The Purple Cow, The Red Rose, The White Horse and The Blue Blazes.\n\nWhen the New York, New Haven and Hartford denied Springs his request for a pass by writing that they were granted only to those lines that generated traffic for its route, he wrote back, \"I note that the New Haven does not consider the L&C Railway of sufficient importance to honor its officials with an annual pass. I have personally routed some two hundred carloads over the New Haven in the past three or four months but you may rest assured that I will do otherwise in the future.\"\n\nWhen Springs moved into his office at the new company headquarters in Fort Mill, he found himself with a and blank space on his walls. He proposed a mural of his railroad, the Lancaster and Chester, but several aerial photographers insisted this would be impossible. In spite of this, Springs sent well-known photographer Elliott Lyman Fisher up with company pilot Cecil Neal. They flew up and down the line until Fisher had photographed every foot of track—villages, mills, woodlands and fields. When several mountings of the prints failed to satisfy Springs, Fisher colored each slide by hand. One hundred and eighty lights illuminated the slides from the rear giving them a three-dimensional effect. The mounting of the mural allowed Springs to inspect his railroad any time he wished.\n\nIn 1946, the L&C upgraded its fleet by buying six diesel locomotives from the U.S. Army. These 65-ton Whitcomb locomotives had seen service in Italy during the war and burned about the same amount of oil to run that the old steam engines used for lubrication. The purchase of these engines made the L&C the first fully diesel-operated railroad in the state, something that Springs liked to boast of. The steam engines formerly used by the railroad were either sold or put out to pasture. However, these diesels did not spend long on the line as they were replaced by three 70-ton GEs in late 1950. Among the Whitcombs, number 51 passed to the Allegheny and South Side Railway where it would stay until the end of that property.\n\nIn 1951, Gypsy Rose Lee was on hand in Lancaster to 'unveil' the new Williamsburg-style depot. Her six-year-old son, Erik, was also present and was photographed with his mother in the cab of one of the L&C's locomotives. In addition, Springs gave the L&C its slogan, \"The Springmaid Line\". He also outfitted a Rolls-Royce as a high rail inspection vehicle. In the late 1950s, the Railway adopted a light blue, gray and white paint scheme to replace the dark blue and white scheme of earlier diesels.\n\nElliott Springs died in 1959 and his son in-law, H.W. Close, became president of Springs and the L&C. In 1961, a steel shop and engine house was built in Lancaster to replace the wood structure that was currently in use. In late 1965, the GE diesels were replaced by two new EMD SW900s. They were given the numbers 90 and 91 and are still in use by the Railway on a regular basis in late 2001. These locomotives handled the traffic on the line—much of the time making two freight runs a day—until December, 1984, when an additional EMD SW900 was added to the fleet and given the number 92. In 1996, two EMD SW1500's, numbered 95 and 96, were added, followed by four EMD SW1200s in 1998, which were numbered 93, 94, 97 and 98. In 2001, the line leased two more ex-Conrails units from Locomotive Leasing Partners, or LLPX, SW1500 #215 and SW1001 #91.\n\nThe L&C added another aspect to its operation in 1996 when Bob Willetts began a passenger car restoration program in Lancaster. The J.P. Henderson car was the first to come out of Lancaster. It is currently in charter service on Amtrak. In the late 1970s, this car had been in storage in New York and a state of disrepair. It was bought, then moved to Hartsville, South Carolina where a total renovation began. It went back into service in 1989 and was later bought by the Lancaster and Chester.\n\nIn 2006, the South Carolina shortline got some national railroad attention again in Pennsylvania. The New Hope and Ivyland Railroad restored their Baldwin steam engine 2-8-0 #40 to her original appearance as a 1920s-era freight locomotive when she worked for the Lancaster and Chester. When the L&C went diesel in 1947, the steamer went to the Cliffside Railroad in North Carolina. Due to the conversion from steam to diesel motive power on the Cliffside, the #40 was sold in 1962. Steam Trains Inc., a Pennsylvanian group of investors, bought the 2-8-0 and had it shipped to the Reading roundhouse in Wilmington, Delaware. By 1966, the equipment was again transferred to New Hope, Pennsylvania where the locomotive operates to this day. However, it is now again lettered for the NH&I.\n\nOn March 25, 2001, the L&C entered into a lease-purchase agreement with Norfolk Southern to operate the SB trackage in Lancaster County. It is the first expansion in route mileage since the inception of the L&C more than one hundred years ago.\n\nOn September 2, 2010, Gulf and Ohio Railways announced it was purchasing the Lancaster and Chester; the deal was planned to be completed by November 2010.\n\nIn 2001, the Lancaster and Chester entered into a lease-purchase agreement with Norfolk Southern to operate the former SB line in Lancaster County. This extends from MP 89.5 near the Catawba River to MP 58.7 in Kershaw, a total of . This ended years of negotiation between the two lines. Until then the Lancaster and Chester Railroad had virtually the same route-mileage since its inception in 1896. It passes over nine wooden trestles ranging in length from long Catawba River Trestle is a combination structure made of wooden trestle segments and four steel though trusses. Along the line lies 66 curves, the sharpest of which is 5 degrees 30 minutes. The steepest grade is a mile and half stretch west of Richburg called, appropriately enough, Richburg Hill. At 4.7%, it is said to be among the steepest in the Southeast. (This might even be more true now that NS stopped rolling trains over Saluda.)\n\nThe Railway invested heavily in its own line in the late 1990s, spending close to nine million dollars over a three- to five-year period. New rail was laid replacing 85 to 95 pound per yard (42–47 kg/m) rail with 127-132 lb/yd (63–66 kg/m) rail. Most of it is stick rail, through some welded sections were added on crossings and curves to simplify maintenance. In addition, the railroad tripled their locomotive fleet in that time period going from three units in 1996 to a total of nine by the end of the decade. Bridges were also strengthened. This allowed the Railway to begin using cars instead of the cars previously used. In time, the L&C plans to use cars.\n\nThere are now two interchanges on the line. One is with Norfolk Southern in Chester on their Charlotte to Columbia main. Traffic to and from the interchange on the NS end is handled daily with their local out of Rock Hill. The power on these locals are generally GP59s or high hood GP38-2s. NS Transcaer GP59 #4611 and Operation Lifesaver #4640 was power for most of October, 2001. An interchange with CSX-predecessor Seaboard Coast Line (and before that Seaboard Air Line) was built in 1981 in East Chester to replace the SCL interchange in Fort Lawn that was abandoned at the same time. Power on these trains can be anything from GP40s to wide noses—even LMSX #710 once or twice—to ex-Con B36-7s.\n\nThe lease agreement with Norfolk Southern effectively takes away the Lancaster interchange which had not been used in many years. Most of the L&C's traffic on the Original 29 is on the Chester end of the line and the car-hire charge was reduced if all interchange was handled there.\n\nThere was a time when the L&C's parent company was responsible for up to 90% of the traffic on the line, up to 13,000 cars annually at the six plants on the line. (The L&C also switched out the Eureka Plant in Chester. To get there, they had to cross Seaboard at grade while using the Southern Columbia to Charlotte main. The last time I saw this happen was in 1989.)\n\nHowever, when Springs bought another company, a truck fleet came with it. The trucking side soon became more dominant and Springs-generated rail traffic dwindled from a couple of thousand cars of textile-related material annually to roughly one hundred cars a year at the Lancaster Complex in the early 2000s. That plant was closed in 2003 and soon torn down to make way for a park. The hundred cars that came out of that plant in later years was bales of corrugated cardboard which was taken a few miles up track to Bowers Fibers. When Springs stopped shipping there by rail, Bowers Fibers stopped receiving by rail. Springs-owned Grace Water Treatment Plant uses about 1,400 cars of coal a year. In terms of revenue, this was for many years the largest business served by the L&C.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the railroad, sensing that Springs-generated traffic would soon dwindle, created a industrial park In Richburg near I-77. Formerly known as Carolina's Distribution Park, since renamed The L&C Railway Distribution Park, this area includes Guardian Industries, Porter-Warner and Thyssen Steel, which was the first industry to move there. \nThyssen, which recently opened a second plant on the line, takes inbound coils of sheet steel and slits them for various industries, such as stampings for automobiles, lawn mowers and refrigerators. The Lancaster and Chester handles up to 2,400 carloads of sand and chemicals to park tenant Guardian Glass a year. Also, the Railway bought four gondolas for Guardian to ship cullet to the Richburg plant from Florida. (However, these gondolas, numbered 300 to 303, are in storage on line. Two of them are in Fort Lawn on the spur that once led to the cotton warehouses.)\n\nThe Railway owns more than of land near I-77 in Richburg and hopes to attract other businesses to the area. But not at any cost. A Charlotte, North Carolina company was recently looking to build along the line. However, research into the company's past revealed a number of environmental citations. As a result of this finding, the Lancaster and Chester decided not to sell to this company.\n\nFor volume of cars, the largest customer on the line was at one time GAF at a section of track in East Chester near the CSX interchange. GAF has stopped shipping as much by rail. Archer-Daniels-Midland in Kershaw is currently the biggest customer on the line with estimates ranging up to 4,000 cars a year. Circle S at MM17 on the Original 29 handles some 3,500 cars a year. Furthermore, there is a shuffle train between the two feed mills. This was billed as an added bonus to L&C operation of the SB. Formerly, 18-wheelers, up to 60 a week, handled this traffic.\n\nThe L&C owns a fleet of boxcars— cars built in 1979, cars built in 1996—that were used primarily by GAF, which manufactures rolled roofing-mat material. The 50 footers once numbered forty in total and were in the 200 to 239 block. Five were lost in a derailment in Arkansas while ten were sold to Lexington & Ohio Railroad in 2000. The 60 footers are numbered 600 to 619. For a time, fifteen of these had been leased by CSX. I believe those have since been returned to service by L&C.\n\nPPG Industries is also in East Chester. PPG manufactures 70 million pounds (32,000 metric tons) of fiber material annually that is used in such diverse products as computers and surfboards. Speciality Polymers, Union Carbide and Owens-Corning are also near the wye at East Chester.\n\nOnce every week to ten days, the L&C gets unit trains from Ohio for the Circle S Feed Mill now at Milepost 17 between Fort Lawn and Richburg. Both Norfolk Southern and CSX were vying for Circle S. But the L&C convinced the owner of the plant to locate on the L&C by making him see that, according to Steve Gedney, president of the L&C, 'he could have the best of both worlds here,' a reference to being able to choose the best rate between both Class 1 carriers that the L&C connects with. It was this business, along with the 4.7 percent grade at Richburg Hill, that prompted the Railway to purchase four ex-Conrail EMD SW1200s which arrived in 1998. One of these 1200s, 97, spent most of the first three years it was on the line at Circle S unloading the grain cars. As of early November, 2001, it had been replaced by LLPX SW1001 #91. When the SW1001 was returned to LLPX, the railroad put their SW900 #91 at the grain mill.\n\nIn all, the Railway handles about 14,000 cars a year in steel, coal, chemicals, glass, fiberglass, sand, corn, barley, soybeans and lumber. Steve Gedney, however, said that it is hard to project actual car loadings. However, this number is certainly an improvement from the 5,800 cars it averaged yearly during the 1980s. An additional 4,000 cars could be added if Circle S undergoes a planned expansion. L&C officials foresee moving between 18,000 and 20,000 cars a year in the future, but add that the line could handle upwards of 30,000 a year (on the original route) \"without bumping into each other.\"\n\nBut it is the recent lease-purchase deal with Norfolk Southern that offers the most hope from growth on the Lancaster and Chester. \"I think the main thing is our presence and having our operating headquarters in this area\", Steve Gedney, the president of the railroad told this reporter.\n\n\"If we want to grow our business, which by doing that helps and assists the local economy whether it be in Lancaster County, Chester County or even York County, we do our own marketing in conjunction with the county economic developers for both counties to try to locate companies and factories that will use rail.\" \nThe primary customers on the new line are the Archers-Daniels-Midland plant in Kershaw and AmeriSteel on Riverside Road in Lancaster. Gedney envisions service to existing companies on the line that presently do not use rail.\n\n\"We are going to see what we can do initially with shippers that have been on the line that have stopped shipping like Thomas and Betts. They’ve got a rail siding going in there. We’re going to talk to them and see if there's anything we can do to help their business which would put rail cars on the line.\"\nAdditionally, a spur was put in at Southern Gas north of the interchange in Lancaster. Southern Railway once served this business, but that spur had been taken up years ago.\n\nThe line has reshuffled the way they move the trains. In addition, they have put in 100 pound-per-yard (50 kg/m) switches. Presently everything that is on the main line right now on the Kershaw District is 85 lb/yd (42 kg/m) rail. This compares with the 127 to 132 lb/yd (63–66 kg/m) rail on the L&C's original line. New ties have been placed as well on all the curves. Gedney adds, \"We’ve also done some bridge work on the 521 bridge. That's not major work, mainly just heavy maintenance.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the L&C and Lancaster County Economic Development Corporation President Ray Gardner are seeking new business to the line. \"We’ve already identified some land around Heath Springs and Kershaw,\" Gardner said and he suggested that it would be used to make a park.\n\nThere are also two parcels of land in the northern part of the county. One is nearly of land at Foster Park. This area is on Riverside Road. \"It's zoned I-2,\" said Gardner, \"heavy industrial. We hope to take advantage of that. On down Riverside Road near the airport, we hope the county is going to get us some land there.\"\n\n\"They didn’t go out of their way marketing,\" Gardner said of how Norfolk Southern handled the line in Lancaster. \"I’m not critical of them. But the L&C has got better service. They’re more dependable. They’re local. If you need something, you can drive down there to see them. They’re eager just like we are.\"\n\nThe purchase of the former SB line in Lancaster has fueled speculation on whether the L&C will ever make it into Catawba where interchange with CSX could be easier for Kershaw. Or perhaps even into Rock Hill. But more than six years after the L&C's end cabs set steel on the SB rails, this has not happened yet. What has happened is that the L&C purchased their first non endcab units, two EMD GP38-2s that were originally leased from Helms Leasing after spending most of their career on Conrail. (They went to Norfolk Southern after the split.) They’ve also currently leasing four rebuilt GP38-2s from GMTX.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2194459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194459", "title": "Steve Cotterill", "text": "Steve Cotterill\n\nStephen John Cotterill (born 20 July 1964) is an English former footballer who played as a striker. He was most recently manager of Championship club Birmingham City.\n\nCotterill had a nine-year career as a footballer playing for Burton Albion, Wimbledon, Brighton & Hove Albion and Bournemouth before deciding to take up football management. He began with Irish side Sligo Rovers and after a year he returned to England and took over at his home town club, Cheltenham Town. He did well at Whaddon Road guiding the club from the sixth tier to the third in five years. His success at Cheltenham led to Stoke City appointing him as their manager prior to the 2002–03 season.\n\nAfter 13 games as manager, he left to become assistant manager to Howard Wilkinson at Sunderland only to be dismissed from this post with Wilkinson in March 2003 after 27 games in the role. He joined Burnley in June 2004. After three years at Turf Moor he moved on to have a short spell at Notts County in 2010 and spent a season-and-a-half at cash-strapped Portsmouth. In October 2011 he was appointed manager at Nottingham Forest guiding the club out of a relegation battle. He was dismissed by Forest in July 2012 after the club was taken over by the Al-Hasawi family. In January 2013, he joined Queens Park Rangers' coaching staff remaining until the end of the 2012–13 season. Cotterill was appointed manager of Bristol City in December 2013, taking them to the Championship before being dismissed in January 2016. He was manager of Championship club Birmingham City from September 2017 to March 2018.\n\nCotterill was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He started his playing career in non-League football as a forward who could play centrally or in wide positions, playing semi-professionally at clubs like Cheltenham Town, Alvechurch and Burton Albion. In 1989, he moved into professional football when signing for Wimbledon in the First Division. He made 25 appearances in four years at Wimbledon and went out on loan to Brighton & Hove Albion to recapture his fitness following a serious cruciate knee-ligament injury. Cotterill signed for Bournemouth in the summer of 1993 for the fee of £120,000. He was out of contract and this fee was set by the then Transfer Tribunal. In three years at Bournemouth he got his career back in good shape scoring 18 goals in 55 league starts for the club. While at the club he picked up three player of the season awards but had to finish his career in 1996 after another bad knee injury from which he was unable to fully recover.\n\nFollowing on from Lawrie Sanchez, Sligo Rovers appointed Cotterill in 1995. He led the club to third place in the Premier Division of the League of Ireland and his side also reached the League of Ireland Cup final, where they lost on penalties to Shelbourne. Cotterill also led them into Europe, playing against teams such as Nantes where they earned a 3–3 draw and another creditable 0–0 draw against Dutch team, Heerenveen.\n\nCotterill joined Cheltenham when they were still a non-league club and he built up a successful side which won promotion from the Southern Football League Premier Division to the Football Conference in his first full year at the club. He won the FA Trophy in 1998, beating Southport 1–0 in the final, and Cheltenham finished second in the Conference the same year, their first season in that league. Cheltenham won the Conference and with it promotion to the Football League the following year. His first two seasons in the Third Division saw them finish in the top half. In 2001–02, the club reached the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time in its history, ended only by a 1–0 away defeat to West Bromwich Albion and including the defeat of Cotterill's future club Burnley. He twice won the prestigious award of Manager of the Year during his tenure. Cotterill took Cheltenham into the Second Division that season, following a play-off victory over Rushden & Diamonds at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. He was awarded his UEFA Pro Licence in 2002.\n\nCotterill left Cheltenham to join First Division side Stoke City in the summer of 2002. His only major summer signing was that of striker Chris Greenacre from Mansfield Town. Stoke began the 2002–03 season with a 0–0 draw at Sheffield Wednesday and their first win came on 17 August against Bradford City. This was followed by a 3–4 defeat by Preston North End and narrow losses to Derby County and Burnley. The side then went five matches unbeaten before Cotterill shocked the club on 10 October by handing in his resignation after just 13 games to become assistant manager to Howard Wilkinson at Sunderland.\n\nAs Howard Wilkinson's assistant, they were tasked with keeping Sunderland in the Premiership. However, Sunderland recorded just two league victories under the new management team and both Wilkinson and Cotterill were dismissed after just 27 games in charge.\n\nIn the summer of 2004, a decision by Burnley not to renew the contract of their manager, Stan Ternent, led to Cotterill being named as the new manager of the club. In his first season at the club they reached the third round of the Football League Cup, beating Aston Villa 3–1 on the way. They also reached the fifth round of the FA Cup, beating Premier League side Liverpool 1–0 in the third round. After losing striker and captain Robbie Blake and young midfielder Richard Chaplow they finished 13th in the Championship. In 2005–06 he led Burnley to a 17th-place finish, again having to sell his star striker, the club's leading goal scorer Ade Akinbiyi to Sheffield United for £1.75 million.\n\nThe 2006–07 season began well, with a series of wins. Cotterill also won the Championship Manager of the Month for October 2006. However Burnley were dealt a blow in November when leading goalscorer Andy Gray was sidelined until February. Akinbiyi was re-signed in the January transfer window, but the striker was unfit and failed to make an impact. Cotterill eventually left the club on 8 November 2007 by mutual consent, after earning the title of longest serving manager in the league with three years seven months service. He left the club in 15th place in the league having won just one game in ten.\n\nIn August 2008, Steve Cotterill was offered the chance to become the head coach and technical director of USL First Division Minnesota Thunder after Amos Magee stepped down. Cotterill was offered a temporary seven-week contract with a view to a longer deal when the season ended. As it would take two weeks to obtain a work permit, leaving only five weeks with Minnesota, Cotterill decided to turn this opportunity down.\n\nOn 23 February 2010, it was announced that Cotterill would be manager of Notts County until the end of the season. On 3 April 2010, Cotterill was named March Football League Two Manager of the Month for six wins and two draws in the month. Cotterill also received this accolade for April 2010. On 27 April 2010, Notts County were crowned champions of League Two after defeating Darlington 5–0.\n\nAfter the 2009–10 season, Cotterill was linked with the vacant Coventry City post but had said that Coventry did not try to contact him. Two weeks later Cotterill publicly turned down the job. On 25 May, another Championship club, Portsmouth confirmed interest in the Notts County boss.\n\nOn 27 May 2010, Notts County announced that Cotterill had left after failing to commit his future to the club. Notts County chairman, Ray Trew said of Cotterill: \"The job that Steve did for us here will live long in the memory of all Notts County fans and, as is a mark of all great managers, he leaves the club in a much better position than when he arrived.\"\n\nCotterill was appointed as manager of Portsmouth on 18 June 2010, with the club in financial difficulty. Cotterill played a key role in stabilising Portsmouth through some turbulent times which saw the club nearly in liquidation. His performance as manager with Portsmouth saw him linked with the manager's job at other clubs, including that at Birmingham City.\n\nIn his second full season and under new ownership, Portsmouth were expected to improve on the previous season's performance. However, the team won just two of their first 10 league matches in the Championship. On 4 October 2011, the joint owner of Portsmouth, Roman Dubov backed him saying \"\"We support him and believe in him – his talent, his attitude and his work\"\".\n\nIt later became public knowledge that Nottingham Forest were interested in hiring Cotterill as their new manager after Steve McClaren resigned from his post on 2 October 2011 after 111 days in charge. This followed the club's poor start to the season and allegations by McClaren of broken promises by the Nottingham Forest board regarding the signing of loan players. Cotterill was granted permission to speak with Nottingham Forest on 14 October 2011 after compensation was agreed with Portsmouth.\n\nCotterill was appointed as manager on 14 October 2011 on a three and half-year deal. He won four of his first six games in charge. Cotterill began his Forest reign with a 2–0 win over Middlesbrough and a 2–1 win at Blackpool. The turnaround was short-lived though as a run of seven games without a goal, during which Forest suffered six defeats leaving them in the bottom three at the turn of the year. Forest ended that sequence with a 3–1 win at Ipswich Town on 2 January 2012 and followed that with a 0–0 draw at home to Leicester City in the third round of the FA Cup. A 4–0 defeat in the replay and two more league defeats, as part of six consecutive home league defeats, meant by the end of January 2012 Forest were 23rd in the league. From mid February, Forest's fortunes improved, starting with a 2–0 win over fellow relegation candidates Coventry City. This culminated in Forest finishing 19th and ten points clear of relegation. Cotterill left the club on 12 July 2012 following the take-over of the club by the Al-Hasawi family, despite Fawaz Al-Hasawi having previously favoured Steve's retention and despite Steve's own preference to remain.\n\nIn January 2013 he joined Queens Park Rangers to be part of Harry Redknapp's coaching staff on a short-term basis.\nCotterill was invited by Redknapp to coach again in the 2013–14 season but declined the offer and left the club.\n\nOn 3 December 2013, Cotterill was appointed manager of League One club Bristol City on a three-and-a-half-year contract. In his first season in charge, Cotterill guided Bristol City to 12th place in League One. In his second season in charge, the 2014–15 season, City won the Football League Trophy, for a record third time. 10 points clear at the top of League One and 37 points ahead of their rivals, City beat Walsall 2–0 at Wembley on 22 March 2015. Cotterill guided Bristol City to promotion from League One in the 2014–15 season with a club record of 99 points. Club chairman Keith Dawe said that the season's success \"will live in the memory for a long time\". Their form since the start of the season under Cotterill was described as \"imperious\" and promotion was gained on 14 April 2015 after a 0–6 away win at Bradford City.\n\nOn 18 April 2015, Bristol City were crowned League One champions following a 0–0 draw at home to Coventry City. This made them the first club to win both the Football League Trophy and League One in the same season since Birmingham City in 1995. It was Bristol City's first league title win for 60 years since their win in the 1954–55 Division Three South. Following Bristol City's promotion to the |Championship, Steve was named LMA League One Manager of the Year, having already earned Sky Bet League One Manager of the Month in September 2014 and March 2015.\n\nDespite their successes in League One, the squad struggled in the Championship after a series of rejected transfers following a lack of investment. Only 256 days after Cotterill had led them back to the Championship, Cotterill was dismissed by Keith Dawe on 14 January 2016, despite his earlier favourable appraisal of Cotterill: \"I believe Steve Cotterill has the capacity to be a Premier League manager\". Other senior figures at the club were also supportive of Cotterill prior to his dismissal, such as club owner Steve Lansdown: \"He is the man at the helm to take us forward\".\n\nWith three matches left of the 2016–17 season, Cotterill joined Birmingham City as first-team coach under new manager Harry Redknapp. He played his part in preparing the team to gain the two wins needed to avoid relegation to League One, but decided against remaining with the club as assistant manager for 2017–18. After Redknapp's dismissal in September 2017, Cotterill agreed a -year contract as Birmingham manager, to take effect on 2 October. After five months in post, during which the team remained in and around the relegation zone, and after a fifth successive league defeat – performance affected at least in part by a series of injuries and boardroom politics – Cotterill was dismissed on 3 March 2018.\n\nSource:\n\nCheltenham Town\n\nNotts County\n\nBristol City\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

In total he served four times as head of the Greek State, most times in the history of the seat.\n\nPávlos Kountouriotis was born on the island of Hydra to Theodoros Kountouriotis, Consul and Member of the Greek Parliament and Loukia Negreponte. From his father's side he descented from the Kountouriotis, a Hydriot family of Arvanite origin originally from the village of Kountoura, in the Megarid and was grandson of Geórgios a shipowner who took part as many members of the family in the Greek War of Independence and who served as Prime Minister of Greece under King Otto. From his mother's side he was descended from the Negreponte family, a prominent family from Chios and was great-grandson of Constantine Hangerli, Prince of Wallachia. He was the second of nine children, including Ioannis Kountouriotis. Little is known of Pávlos' childhood. In 1875, following his family's long-standing naval tradition, he joined the Royal Hellenic Navy, presumably in the rank of Ensign. .\n\nIn 1886, he took part in the naval operations at Preveza as a lieutenant. During the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, serving as lieutenant commander he commanded the ship \"Alfeios\". His ship took part in at least two landings of Greek troops on the island of Crete. In 1901, commanding the training ship \"Miaoulis\", he was sent to Boston. This was reported as the first transatlantic trip of a Greek war vessel. Kountouriotis served as an aide-de-camp to King Geórgios I from 1908 until 1911, receiving the rank of Captain in 1909.\nIn June 1911, Kountouriotis was sent to Britain, to take control of the newly-commissioned , following the \"blue cheese mutiny\". As he was highly esteemed, he quickly reimposed discipline and set sail for Greece.\n\nOn 16 April 1912 he was appointed Chief of the Navy General Staff until 16 September, when he was appointed of the Aegean Fleet, in view of the worsening situation in the Balkans, and the imminent outbreak of the First Balkan War.\n\nKountouriotis played a crucial role in the Greek government's decision to enter the war. Partly because the Greek fleet had not yet completed its modernization programme, and in view of the disaster of 1897, the Greek leadership remained ambivalent about Greece's prospects. Kountouriotis weighed in decisively in these discussions, proclaiming his confidence that even with the existing fleet, victory could be achieved, thanks to superior personnel. His reply to Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos became famous:\nDuring the Balkan Wars, with his flagship, \"Georgios Averof\", he led the Greek Navy to major victories against the Turkish fleet in December 1912 (Battle of Elli) and in January 1913 (Battle of Limnos), bringing most of the Aegean islands under Greek control. His victories, due in large part to his daring but successful tactics, earned him the status of a national hero. He was promoted to vice admiral for \"exceptional war service\", the first Greek career officer since Constantine Kanaris to reach the rank (usually reserved for members of the Greek royal family).\n\nIn 1916, he became a minister in the Stephanos Skouloudis government, but, in disagreement with the pro-German feelings of King Konstantínos I of the Hellenes, he followed Eleftherios Venizelos to Thessaloniki where he was assigned the ministry of Naval Affairs in Venizelos' National Defence government. Konstantínos was deposed, and replaced on the throne by his second-eldest son, The Prince Aléxandros. Kountouriotis subsequently retired from the navy with the honorary rank of full Admiral. On the death of the young King Aléxandros of the Hellenes in 1920, he was elected Regent of Greece by the Greek Parliament on 28 October by a vote of 137 to 3. After the sitting government of Venizelos was defeated in the elections that took place in November 1920, Kountouriotis resigned as Regent on 17 November, to be replaced by Queen Olga, King Aléxandros's grandmother. The following month, King Konstantínos was restored.\n\nIn March 1924, after King Geórgios II of the Hellenes was deposed, he was elected as the first President of the Second Hellenic Republic, but resigned the post in March, 1926, in opposition to General Pangalos' dictatorship. He was reelected President in May 1929, but due to serious health complications he resigned in December of the same year.\n\nAdmiral Pávlos Kountouriotis died in 1935. Α World War II Greek destroyer and a Standard-class frigate, \"Kountouriotis\", are named after him.\n\nOne of the two gold 100-Euro coins issued by Greece in 2012 to commemorate the centenary of the Balkan Wars featured Kountouriotis and \"Georgios Averof\".\n\n"}

Hyoscine butylbromide can be taken by mouth, injection into a muscle, or into a vein.\nSide effects may include sleepiness, vision changes, dry mouth, rapid heart rate, triggering of glaucoma, and severe allergies. Sleepiness however, is uncommon. It is unclear if it is safe in pregnancy. It appears safe in breastfeeding. Greater care is recommended in those with heart problems. It is an anticholinergic agent, which does not have much effect on the brain.\nHyoscine butylbromide was patented in 1950, and approved for medical use in 1951. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is not available in the United States, and a similar compound methscopolamine may be used instead. The wholesale cost in the developing world is US$0.004–0.11 per pill as of 2014. It is manufactured from hyoscine which occurs naturally in the plant deadly nightshade.\n\nHyoscine butylbromide is effective in treating crampy abdominal pain.\n\nHyoscine butylbromide is effective in reducing the duration of the first stage of labour, and it is not associated with any obvious adverse outcomes in mother or neonate.\n\nIt is also used during abdominal or pelvic MRI or CT scans to improve the quality of pictures.\n\nAs little of the medication crosses the blood brain barrier it has less effect on the brain and therefore has reduced occurrence of the centrally mediated effects (such as delusions, somnolence, and inhibition of motor-functions) which hinder the usefulness of some other anticholinergic drugs. Hyoscine butylbromide is still capable of impacting the chemoreceptor trigger zone due to the lack of a well-developed blood-brain-barrier in the medulla oblongata, which potentiates the antiemetic effects that it produces via local action on the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nIt is a quaternary ammonium compound and a semisynthetic derivative of hyoscine hydrobromide (scopolamine). The attachment of the butyl-bromide moiety effectively prevents the movement of this drug across the blood–brain barrier, effectively minimising undesirable central nervous system side effects associated with scopolamine/hyoscine.\n\nHyoscine butylbromide is not centrally active and has a low incidence of abuse. In 2015, it was reported that prisoners at Wandsworth Prison and other UK prisons were smoking prescribed hyoscine butylbromide, releasing the potent hallucinogen scopolamine. There have also been reports of abuse in Mashhad Central Prison in Iran.\n"}

Elliott\n\nWilliam John Shannon Elliott, , known commonly as Bill Elliott, is a career civil servant with the Government of Canada and served as the first civilian Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from July 16, 2007 to November 20, 2011. He served as the Special Representative of INTERPOL to the United Nations, as well as the Special Adviser to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness until his retirement in 2014.\n\nElliott received a Bachelor of Arts in 1976 and a Bachelor's degree in Common Law in 1979, both from the University of Ottawa. He was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1981 and remains a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada as a non-practicing lawyer.\n\nElliott started his professional career in 1981 as a lawyer in a private law practice. In 1988, he left private practice to join the Deputy Prime Minister of Canada's office as a Legal Advisor and Special Assistant and then Executive Assistant in 1989. In 1990, Elliott was promoted to Chief of Staff to Deputy Prime Minister Don Mazankowski in the Mulroney government, a position he held until 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Elliott joined the Public Service of Canada as Senior Counsel/Manager, Comprehensive Claims and Northern Affairs for the Department of Justice and was based at the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Legal Services Unit. In 1994, he was promoted to Senior General Counsel and Head of Legal Services, Indian Affairs and Northern Development.\n\nIn 1998, Elliott was appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Canadian Coast Guard and held the authority of an Assistant Deputy Minister.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2003, Elliott was appointed Assistant Deputy Minister, Safety and Security, at Transport Canada. The Safety and Security Branch of Transport Canada is responsible for the development and enforcement of regulations and national standards, as well as for the implementation of monitoring, testing, and inspections, which contribute to safety and security in the aviation, marine, rail and road modes of transport.\n\nMr. Elliott was appointed Assistant Secretary to the Cabinet in 2003, responsible for the Security and Intelligence Secretariat of the Privy Council Office.\n\nThe secretariat provides support and secretariat services to the Cabinet Committee for Foreign Affairs and Security (formerly the Cabinet Committee on Security, Public Health and Emergencies), in addition to the Advisory Council on National Security who provides confidential expert advice to the Government through the National Security Advisor on issues related to national security.\n\nIn his role, Elliott supported the National Security Advisor and as Assistant Secretary, was responsible for the support and secretariat services provided to Cabinet Committees and Ministers of the Crown.\n\nIn April 2005, Elliott was appointed by the prime minister, Paul Martin, National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nOn May 1, 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed Elliott the Associate Deputy Minister of Public Safety Canada, alongside Deputy Minister of Public Safety, Suzanne Hurtubise. In his role, Elliott assumed responsibility for several key branches within the Department, including the Policing, Law Enforcement and Interoperability Branch; and, the Emergency Management and National Security Branch.\n\nElliott was announced as the 22nd Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on 6 July 2007, by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, making him the first commissioner that had not previously served in the police or military. He formally assumed command on July 16, 2007.\n\nHis appointment came after the resignation of Giuliano Zaccardelli, who left the force rocked by scandal and in crisis. Reaction to Elliott's appointment was mixed. Public perceptions are that the force's problems are rooted in its institutional culture and many felt that someone from outside the Canadian policing milieu and \"free of loyalties\" was necessary to effect necessary change. Many on the force, however, believe that one of their own, someone \"who understands the force's unique culture and structure was needed to clean up the organization.\" On February 4, 2011 the Prime Minister's Office announced that Elliot would step down as commissioner in the summer of 2011.\n\nAs a civilian appointment, Elliot never wore the RCMP uniform during his time as Commissioner.\n\nOn August 18, 2011, the Secretary General of INTERPOL, Ronald K. Noble, announced that Elliott will be appointed to a three-year term as Special Representative of INTERPOL to the United Nations, effective November 21, 2011. He previously served as a Delegate for the America's with INTERPOL's Executive Committee.\nElliott's responsibilities will include working to facilitate and enhance co-operation between INTERPOL and the United Nations and its agencies on matters of terrorism, transnational organized crime and international police cooperation. As head of INTERPOL's UN office, the Special Representative of INTERPOL to the United Nations assists both organizations to develop key INTERPOL-UN partnerships to combat international crime and works with senior officials at the UN to identify resource-sharing opportunities.\n\nThe Order of Merit of the Police Forces honours a career of exceptional service or distinctive merit displayed by the men and women of the Canadian Police Services, and recognizes their commitment to this country. The primary focus is on exceptional merit, contributions to policing and community development. As Commissioner of the RCMP, Elliott holds the Commission of Principal Commander of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces. Upon leaving the RCMP, Elliott will continue to be a Commander of the Order.\n\nThe Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem has been a Canadian national honour since 1990, recognizing charitably minded men and women whose philanthropy is expressed principally through its two foundations, the St. John Eye Hospital in Jerusalem and St. John Ambulance. Elliott was installed an Officer of the Order of St. John in 2008.\n\nIn 1992, Elliott was commissioned a Queen's Counsel (or King's Counsel during the reign of a male sovereign), a lawyer appointed by letters patent to be one of \"Her [or His] Majesty's Counsel learned in the law\". While Ontario has ceased appointments to the rank of Queen's Counsel, membership continues to exist in various provinces within Canada and Commonwealth countries around the world. Privileges of membership include sitting within the Bar of court.\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal was created in 2002 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ascension of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II to the throne. The Medal was awarded to Canadians who have made outstanding and exemplary contributions to their communities or to Canada as a whole. Elliott was awarded the Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002.\n\n"}

{"id": "2194552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194552", "title": "Guy Noir", "text": "Guy Noir\n\nGuy Noir is a fictional private detective regularly featured on the public radio show \"A Prairie Home Companion\". Voiced by Garrison Keillor, the character parodies the conventions of hardboiled fiction and the film noir genre. Guy Noir works on the twelfth floor of the Acme Building in a city that \"knows how to keep its secrets\", St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nThe first Guy Noir segments aired in 1995 and were heavy on tongue-twisters, alliteration and other wordplay. In early episodes of the series, Guy and his \"friend\" Pete (Walter Bobbie) would often get into fights and end up shooting each other. Both died many times. However, following Bobbie's departure as a show regular, Pete appears to have died off for good.\n\nIn later episodes, Noir is a down-on-his-luck detective, who ends up taking odd jobs to get by, such as finding missing poodles. Thrown in with these plots tend to be references to current events. For example, in November 2006, while waiting for a case, Noir contents himself by listening to parts of George W. Bush's post-mid-term election speech. Occasionally, political agents use him for hatchet work.\n\nFor the portion of \"A Prairie Home Companion\"'s season that is performed outside of St. Paul, the setting of Noir's case usually involves the city that the program is visiting that week. In the same skit as the Bush reference, Noir is flown to Hawaii to look for a missing Minnesotan. That week, the show was broadcast from Hawaii. \n\nRecurring characters in the skits include: Sugar (Sue Scott), a romantic interest; Jimmy (Tim Russell), a bartender; and Wendell (Tom Keith), the boy who works at the deli around the corner. Wendell's nasally pubescent voice and BLT sandwiches are always there for Noir, though his character is minor. \n\nNoir often runs into a beautiful, mysterious woman during the skits, part of the play on film noir movies. Jazzy saxophone music is played as Noir describes the beauty, sometimes to the point of absurdity. For example:\nShe was tall, blonde, in jeans that looked sprayed on and a T-shirt so tight I could study her bone structure. I could see she wasn't from Duluth. There were no chinstrap marks on her neck, her hair hadn't been deformed by stocking caps, she didn't have that roll of fat around her middle—her midriff was as tight as the cap on a pickle jar.\nand\nShe was tall and long-legged and her blonde hair hung down sort of like what Beethoven had in mind when he wrote the Moonlight Sonata. She wore a knit sweater and jeans so tight it looked as if she'd been poured into them and forgot to say \"When\". When she moved, she seemed to undulate under her clothes in ways that took a man's mind off the state of the economy.\nand\nShe was tall and dark and so beautiful you wanted to just give her all your money right away and skip the preliminaries.\n\nNoir is the protagonist of Keillor's book \"Guy Noir and the Straight Skinny\", where he falls in with Naomi Fallopian and her get-rich-quick diet pill scheme. The story has many of the hallmarks of the radio dramas.\n\nA 2006 Guy Noir skit, in which some characters had a fictitious variation of Tourette syndrome called \"Broadway Tourette's\", drew criticism from the Tourette Syndrome Association.\n\nNoir is played in the 2006 film \"A Prairie Home Companion\" by Kevin Kline. In the film, Guy's detective career is faltering, and he works as a security guard at a radio show to pay the bills. It is strongly implied that he is taken by an angel of death named Asphodel at the end of the movie, though since she is played by Virginia Madsen in a trench coat, this might be considered a relatively upbeat ending by Guy's standards.\n\nThe late Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone was a known fan of Noir; Noir was his favorite segment. Following his untimely 2002 death in a plane crash, the next \"APHC\" opened with a Noir segment, skipping even the show's theme song.\n\n"}

Two other sons, Thomas, and James, also became artists.\n\nUntil the age of 11, John attended Girthon Parish School. The \"Castle Douglas Weekly Visitor\" for 19 August 1831 recorded that at the examination of Girthon school \"the company present were shown a beautiful and correct book of maps, executed by John Faed, as a specimen of his many and varied drawings, which often ere now have elicited the admiration of all who have seen them\".\n\nFaed primarily painted religious, literary, and historical scenes. He exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy and the Royal Academy almost continually. When he was President of the Kirkcudbrightshire Fine Art Association in 1899, his portrait of \"Sir Isaac Newton\" (painted when Faed was 36) was shown in the Dalbeattie Loan and Industrial Exhibition which took place in July and August that year.\n\nFaed also had a following in the United States. His \"Portrait of George Washington taking the Salute at Trenton\" was so popular that it was selected to illustrate an article on Washington in the \"Magazine of American History\" in 1880. His highly successful painting \"Shakespeare and his Friends at the Mermaid Tavern\" was sold to an American in 1851.\n\nHis paintings, popular in Victorian Britain, can today be found in private and public collections, including the National Gallery of Scotland.\n\nIn 1859 he helped Joseph Noel Paton raise the 1st Edinburgh (City) Artillery Volunteer Corps from among artists in the city and served as its lieutenant. He was an active member of the community where he finally made his home, Gatehouse of Fleet. He helped to conceive and develop a number of community projects such as the clock tower and the town hall, which was opened in August 1885 by his brother Thomas Faed, by then a celebrated Academician.\n\nFaed became seriously ill in the summer of 1902, and died on 22 October at the age of 83. He was buried beside his wife, Jane, in the new Girthon parish churchyard.\n\nThe known titles of his works amount to 278 items. Of these, 241 were hung in the Royal Scottish Academy, twenty of which were exhibited in the Royal Academy, and nineteen were exhibited in the Royal Academy only.

She subsequently graduated from Girton College, Cambridge University in the UK in 1975 with undergraduate degrees in anthropology and archaeology. On her return to Japan, she obtained a position working for a translation company, but soon returned to England to learn about legal terminology used in statutes. She returned to Japan again in 1982. After her return, she was hired to assist Prince Mikasa as an interpreter and assistant at the 31st International Asian-North African Cultural Symposium. Princess Takamado received a PhD in arts from the Osaka University of Arts in February 2012.\n\nOn 23 April 1984, she attended a reception hosted by the Embassy of Canada in Tokyo, where she first met Norihito, Prince Takamado. He proposed on 20 May and the Imperial Household Council announced the engagement on 1 August 1984. The formal engagement ceremony made on 17 September 1984, and the wedding held on 6 December 1984.

The character had a feud with Sting which lasted from fall to winter that year.\n\nIn August 1990, The Black Scorpion debuted in WCW (which was still under the NWA banner at the time) in vignettes taunting NWA World Heavyweight Champion Sting. He wore a hooded robe to conceal his face and warned Sting he was after him. The wrestler playing this part was Ole Anderson with his voice distorted enough to keep the fans pondering his identity. The announcers and parties involved attempted to imply that The Scorpion was a former friend of Sting, with the main suspects being former tag partner Jim Hellwig (a.k.a. The Ultimate Warrior, who was the WWF Champion at the time), or former training and Powerteam USA partner Dave Sheldon aka The Angel of Death.\n\nThe Black Scorpion debuted in the ring against Sting for his title at Clash of the Champions XII on September 5, 1990. The wrestler playing him this time was Al Perez, who, according to Ric Flair, was supposed to remain The Black Scorpion until his unmasking—that is, before he quit. Sting was about to unmask him when another Black Scorpion appeared on the entrance ramp, allowing the one that wrestled to escape. The Scorpion would also incorporate amateur \"magic\" into his taunting of Sting by performing parlor tricks with members of the audience, presumably plants. According to one wrestling website, magician Franz Harary performed the illusions.\n\nSting wrestled Black Scorpion at house shows but could never unmask him because of continuous attacks by Sid Vicious. The performers Sting faced at these house shows were either Jeff Ellis or The Angel of Death. The Black Scorpion gimmick was cut short by an accident in training when Anderson's arm was broken. His comeback plans had to be scrapped, and the injury forced a rewrite to the entire storyline. Anderson never returned to active wrestling again and would eventually become a referee.\n\nEventually, a rematch was signed between Sting and the Black Scorpion for Starrcade. It was to be a cage match with professional wrestling legend Dick the Bruiser as the special guest referee. The rule was if the Black Scorpion did not win the title, he would be forced to reveal his identity. Sting defeated the Black Scorpion with a flying shoulder tackle off the top rope. The Scorpion was unmasked to reveal Ric Flair. According to Flair, it would have been either himself or Barry Windham. Flair volunteered thinking the gimmick wouldn't hurt him, whereas it could Windham, who recently portrayed an imposter Sting at Halloween Havoc on October 27. The Black Scorpion angle ended with Flair's unmasking. Flair, as himself, ended up winning the title from Sting at a WCW house show less than a month later.\n\n\n"}

There, in conjunction with others, he pitched an early comedy-adventure version of the TV series \"Gargoyles\" to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Eventually, the idea underwent a transformation from Weisman's initial conception as a largely comedic cartoon, to an episodic but sequential animated action-drama, and the series was produced for syndication. Though \"Gargoyles\" itself bears no on-air creator credit, Weisman describes himself on his website as \"one of the creators\" of the show. Aired as a syndicated show for 65 episodes, \"Gargoyles\" was later picked up for a further 13 episodes by ABC. Weisman was credited as a co-producer of \"Gargoyles\" from episode 6, and as a supervising producer for much of the show's second season, but he has disassociated himself from the third season (\"The Goliath Chronicles\"). Weisman is notable for the question and answer forum he participates in with \"Gargoyles\" fans online.\n\nWeisman's other television credits include overseeing the first season of \"Max Steel\", the second season of \"W.I.T.C.H.\", and both seasons of \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" and four of \"Young Justice\". Weisman has written episodes for numerous animated series, including \"\", \"\", and \"Kim Possible\". He also voice directs and voice acts on occasion; he played the role of Donald Menken on \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" and Lucas \"Snapper\" Carr on \"Young Justice\". Weisman was also executive producer on \"Star Wars Rebels\", alongside Dave Filoni and Simon Kinberg, but left the series after the first season. In 2016, it was reported that he would return in the upcoming revival season of \"Young Justice\", alongside Brandon Vietti; the new season, titled \"Young Justice: Outsiders\", began streaming on DC Universe in January of 2019.\n\nWeisman also continues to write for comics, including in continuity continuations of the storylines from the television series \"Gargoyles\" and \"Young Justice\". On the latter, Weisman, along with Kevin Hopps, became full-time writers of the tie-in comic as of issue #7 (as well as issue #0). Weisman also wrote a parody of \"Gargoyles\" and \"Captain Atom\" in \"JLA Showcase\" #1. During his time with the \"Star Wars\" franchise, Weisman wrote the miniseries \"Star Wars: Kanan\" for Lucasfilm and Marvel Comics. From 2015 to 2016, he wrote the superhero series \"Starbrand & Nightmask\", which lasted six issues.\n\nAfter leaving Disney in 1996, Weisman spent two years at DreamWorks, where he created and developed a new television series called \"Rain of the Ghosts\". When the series was not picked up, Weisman bought the property back to turn it into a series of novels. His debut novel, also titled \"Rain of the Ghosts\", was released in 2013. Its sequel, \"Spirits of Ash and Foam\", followed in 2014. Weisman has announced that the third book will be titled \"Masque of Bones\", and in 2015, he released a full-cast unabridged AudioPlay based on \"Rain of the Ghosts\" after successfully crowdfunding the project through Kickstarter. It was the most funded young adult project on Kickstarter. In 2016, Weisman released a children's novel in the \"World of Warcraft\" universe entitled \"World of Warcraft: Traveler\", followed by a sequel, \"World of Warcraft: Traveler - The Spiral Path\". Weisman's next novel is set in the \"\" universe. \"War of the Spark - Ravnica\" was released on April 23, 2019 and made the New York Times Best Sellers List. Its sequel, \"War of the Spark - Forsaken\", was released in November of 2019.\n\n"}

Much of its development was attributable to the entrepreneur James Murray's decision to build his summer home, Cally House there in 1763. The house is now the Cally Palace Hotel.\n\nOver the next hundred years, the town developed into a centre for industry, particularly cotton mills. The western approach to the town is dominated by the imposing Cardoness Castle. Gatehouse of Fleet is the birthplace of Victorian artist John Faed. The renowned inventor of clockwork mechanisms, Robert Williamson, was also known to have set up a workshop in the town in 1778, which burned to the ground (and claimed his life) in 1794.\n\nThe town takes its name from its location near the mouth of the river called the Water of Fleet which empties into Wigtown Bay at Fleet Bay, and its former role as the \"Gait House\" or \"the House on the Road on the River Fleet\" or toll booth of the late 18th century stagecoach route from Dumfries to Stranraer, now the A75 road. It was a haven along this route, and travellers would often stop in the area rather than furthering the journey at night due to the high numbers of bandits and highwaymen at the time.\n\nCally House was designed by Robert Mylne and built in 1763. The house was sold in 1933 and became a hotel, which opened in 1934. It was used as a residential school for evacuees from Glasgow during the Second World War, reopening as an hotel in the later 1940s.\n\nThe settlement of Anwoth is one mile (1.5 km) to the west of Gatehouse of Fleet; this is where Samuel Rutherford was minister from 1627 to 1636.\n\nGatehouse has the second oldest average population of towns in Scotland.\n\nJeanie Donnan, (1864-1942),  \"\"The Galloway Poetess\"\", was born here before moving to Whithorn in Wigtownshire where she lived on George Street and where she is commemorated by a plaque. She wrote poetry about local events. Her works include Hameland: The Poems of Jeannie Donnan, 1907; War Poems, 1915; The Hills of Hame, 1930. Many of her poems were also published in the \"Galloway Gazette\". \n\nChurch of the Resurrection, 1971 designed by Sutherland, Dickie & Copland. The church is lit by a dramatic clerestory window.

Since the closure of this church on 1 February 2020 and ahead of its demolition, the sculptures have been removed to St Andrew and St Cuthbert Church in Kirkcudbright.\n\n\"The Swallows\" is an artwork created in willo by local artist Lizzie Farey and was a memorial commission. The last Mass was celebrated on the 1st February 2020 by the Bishop of Galloway, William Nolan and parish priest Rev Fr William McFadden. The church will be demolished and the site sold for housing.\n\nPart of the action of \"Five Red Herrings\", a 1931 Lord Peter Wimsey detective novel by Dorothy L.

It is based on the French F1 grenade and contains a 60-gram explosive charge (TNT). The total weight of the grenade with the fuze is about 600 grams.\n\nDue to its shape and its yellow-green color, it is nicknamed the (fem. \"lemon\"). It is also nicknamed \"Efka\" () for the letter F. It is similar to the American Mk 2 \"pineapple grenade\", which was also ultimately modeled on the French F1.\n\nThe UZRGM (\"Universal'nyi Zapal, Ruchnaya Granata, Modernizirovannyi\", 'Universal Igniter, Hand Grenade, Improved') fuse is a universal Russian type also used in the RG-41, RG-42, RGO-78, RGN-86 and RGD-5 grenades. The standard time delay for this fuse is 3.5 to 4 seconds. However, UZRGM fuse variants are available which give delays between zero (i.e., instantaneous, specifically for use in booby-traps) and 13 seconds. It is possible to hear a loud \"pop\" as the fuse ignites and begins to burn.\n\nThe F1 was introduced during World War II and subsequently redesigned post-war. It has a steel exterior that is notched to facilitate fragmentation upon detonation and to prevent hands from slipping. The distance the grenade can be thrown is estimated at 30–45 meters. The radius of the shrapnel dispersion is up to 200 meters (effective radius is about 30 meters, by some sources (Russian)). Hence, the grenade has to be deployed from a defensive position to avoid self harm. About 60 percent of the grenade body pulverizes during the explosion, only 30 percent of the body splints into 290 high velocity sharp cut splinters each weighing around 1 gram with initial speed of about 700 meters per second.\n\nThe F1 grenade has been supplied to various Soviet allies and Third World nations over the years, including Iraq and other Arab nations, and there are different production variations according to country of origin (in terms of finish, markings and spoon/lever design). Though obsolete and no longer in production, it can still be encountered in combat zones.\n\n\n\n"}

He served in the Third Anglo-Ashanti War in 1873 and then in the expedition of Sir Charles Warren to Bechuanaland in the mid 1880s. He took a prominent role as General Officer Commanding the 1st Division in the Second Boer War. He suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Magersfontein, during which he failed to carry out adequate reconnaissance and accordingly his artillery bombarded the wrong place leading to the Highland Brigade taking heavy casualties. He was later captured by the Boers at Tweebosch. After the war he became General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in South Africa in 1908, Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Natal in 1910 and then Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Malta in 1915.\n\nPaul Sanford Methuen was born at Corsham Court, Wiltshire, the eldest of three sons of Frederick Methuen, 2nd Baron Methuen and his wife Anna Horatia Caroline Methuen (née Sanford).\n\nEducated at Eton College, Methuen served two years as a cornet in the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry and then joined the Scots Fusilier Guards as an ensign in the regiment and lieutenant in the army on 22 November 1864. He was promoted to lieutenant in the regiment and captain in the army on 25 December 1867, and became adjutant of the 1st battalion in 1868. He became brigade major, Home District in 1871 and saw active duty on the staff of Sir Garnet Wolseley at Amoaful in 1873 during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War. Promoted to captain in the regiment and lieutenant colonel in the army on 15 July 1876, he became assistant military secretary in Ireland in 1877, military attaché in Berlin in 1878 and quartermaster-general at the Home District in April 1881, before being promoted to colonel on 1 July. He was the commandant of headquarters in Egypt for three months in 1882, being present at the Battle of Tel el-Kebir. On return to the UK he became assistant-adjutant and quartermaster-general for the Home District again. He was promoted to major in the regiment on 25 October 1882.\n\nMethuen served in the expedition of Sir Charles Warren to Bechuanaland in 1884 to 1885, where he commanded Methuen's Horse, a corps of mounted rifles. He became deputy adjutant-general, in South Africa in 1888, and having been promoted to major general on 21 May 1890, he succeeded his father as 3rd baron in 1891. He became Major-General commanding the Brigade of Guards and General Officer Commanding the Home District in April 1892 and then served as press censor at headquarters on the Tirah expedition in 1897. Promoted to lieutenant general on 1 April 1898, he was given the command of the 1st Division on the outbreak of the Second Boer War.\n\nMethuen reached South Africa in November 1899 with orders to relieve Kimberley but initially just expelled the Boers from Belmont and Graspan. He was slightly wounded at the Battle of Modder River. He suffered both defeats and successes during the war. His greatest defeat was at the Battle of Magersfontein, during which he failed to carry out adequate reconnaissance and accordingly his artillery bombarded the wrong place leading to the Highland Brigade taking heavy casualties. The battle was regarded as one of the three British disasters in \"Black Week\" that led to the despatch of Lord Roberts to South Africa.\n\nAfter Magersfontein, Methuen remained in the Kimberley–Boshof area trying to capture Boer General Christiaan de Wet. Methuen was himself captured by the Boers at Tweebosch on 7 March 1902. He had been wounded in the battle when he broke his leg after his horse fell on him. Boer General Koos de la Rey released him due to the severity of his injuries, providing his personal cart to take Methuen to hospital in Klerksdorp. The two allegedly became lifelong friends as a result of this action. Following the end of hostilities in early June 1902, he left Cape Town with other invalids and convalescents on board the \"SS Assaye\", arriving in Southampton the following month, still walking with crutches.\n\nIn his final despatch from South Africa in June 1902, Lord Kitchener, Commander-in-Chief of the forces during the latter part of the war, described the effort of his brother officer the following way:\nFor his war service he received the Queen's South Africa Medal with clasps and was promoted to a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1901 South Africa Honours list (the order was dated to 29 November 1900, and he was only invested as such after his return home, by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902) He was further promoted to a Knight Grand Cross in the Order (GCB) in the October 1902 South Africa Honours list.\n\nDespite visible setbacks on the battlefield during the Boer War, Methuen continued to be well regarded, and was given more responsibilities. Appointed colonel of the Scots Guards on 1 May 1904 and promoted to full general on 26 May, he was given the command of the IV Army Corps in June 1904, before it was reconstituted as Eastern Command in June 1905. He was also invited to become a board member of the Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation in August 1905. He became General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in South Africa in April 1908 and Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Natal in January 1910 before being promoted to field marshal on 19 June 1911.\n\nMethuen helped raise the standards of training of the British Expeditionary Force in 1914 and was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Malta in February 1915, a post he held until he retired in May 1919.\n\nIn retirement Methuen was appointed Constable of the Tower late in 1919 and deputy lieutenant of Wiltshire in 1921. He devoted himself to the interests of the Brigade of Guards and died at Corsham Court on 30 October 1932.\n\nLord Methuen was married twice, first to Evelyn, the eldest daughter of Sir Frederick Hervey-Bathurst, of Clarendon Park, Wiltshire. They were married in 1878 until her death in 1879. He then married in 1884, his cousin Mary Ethel, the second daughter of William Ayshford Sanford, of Nynehead Court. They had three sons and two daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the painter and zoologist Paul Ayshford Methuen, 4th Baron Methuen.

Since this is almost universally fatal, it is considered an especially conspicuous and selfless act of individual sacrifice in wartime; in United States military history, more citations for the Medal of Honor have been awarded for falling on grenades to save comrades than any other single act.\n\nSuch an act can be survivable: in World War II, U.S. Marine Jack Lucas, in the Battle of Iwo Jima, placed two grenades under his steel M1 Helmet and himself before they exploded. Lucas lived, but spent the rest of his life with over 200 pieces of shrapnel in his body. In 2008 near Sangin in Afghanistan, British Royal Marine Matthew Croucher used his rucksack to pin the grenade to the floor; his body armor absorbed the majority of the blast. On November 21, 2010 in Marjah, Helmand Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Kyle Carpenter threw himself upon a grenade, thrown onto a rooftop, to save a fellow Marine, sustaining injuries to his face and right arm and losing his right eye; he survived these wounds.

He is best known for his collaboration with Helen Schucman in typing the original manuscript and being on the editing team for \"A Course in Miracles\" (\"ACIM\"), a self-study curriculum in religious psychology. He died in 1988, aged 65, in Tiburon, California, after having made his involvement with the ACIM material and its study the most central focus of his life.\n\nThetford was born on April 25, 1923, in Chicago, Illinois to John and Mabel Thetford as the youngest of three children. At the time of his birth and early childhood, his parents were both regular members of the Christian Science church. At the age of seven, the untimely death of his older sister caused his parents to disavow their affiliation with the Church of Christian Science. Afterwards, for the next few years, Thetford sampled various other Protestant denominations.\n\nAt the age of nine he contracted a severe case of scarlet fever, which led to rheumatic fever and a debilitating heart condition. These resulting health problems forced him to spend the next three years at home recuperating. During his forced recuperation period he took advantage of the many free hours, using the time to satisfy his voracious appetite for reading. Despite his absence from the classroom, he entered high school at the age of twelve.\n\nFollowing graduation from high school, he was awarded a four-year scholarship to DePauw University in Indiana where he graduated with majors in psychology and pre-medicine in 1944. During the course of his university studies, Thetford eventually settled on the idea of specializing in psychology, and in 1949 he received his PhD in this field from the University of Chicago.\n\nAfter graduating from DePauw in January 1944 until the summer of 1945, Thetford had a job as an administrative officer at the University of Chicago working with the scientific team doing atomic research. In his graduate studies he was fortunate to be one of the first students of the renowned psychologist, Carl Rogers.\n\nFor the five years following his graduation in 1949, Thetford worked as a research psychologist in both Chicago, and later in Washington, D.C. He was a research psychologist in the Institute for Psychosomatic & Psychiatric Research & Training at the Reese Hospital in Chicago from 1949-1951 and a senior psychologist for the United States government in Washington, DC from 1951-1954. In 1953 he was a consultant in Beirut, Lebanon at the Foreign Service Institute. He spent 1954 and 1955 as the director of clinical psychology at The Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut. From 1955 to 1957 he was an assistant professor of psychology at Cornell University.\n\nIn 1958 he accepted an assistant professorship, which later developed into a full professorship, at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. During a portion of this same period he also served as the Director of Clinical Psychology at the Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. It was here that he would stay for the next 20 years, and it was here that he first met Helen Schucman, hiring her as a research psychologist and assistant.\n\nA c.v. listing his positions, affiliations, grants, publications and papers is given as Appendix 2 in a biography \"Never Forget to Laugh\" by Carol Howe.\n\nThe working relationship between Thetford and Schucman was apparently often somewhat strained, yet throughout these difficulties they would always maintain a certain level of professional courtesy and respect for one another. The story is often retold that it was into this environment of inter-relational strain between Thetford and Schucman that the \"ACIM\" material was in a sense first “invited” into this world. This “invitation” came in the form of an exclamation by Thetford one day, in the midst of one of their periodic difficulties, in which Thetford exclaimed, “There must be another way!” This exclamation was followed by a certain speech he made to Schucman describing how he believed that it was time for them to try to refocus their energies on constructive and helpful agendas, rather than being forever hyper critical and hyper competitive with one another. Expecting a typically condescending response from Schucman, the studied silence that followed his speech was then followed by a most surprising concurrence from Schucman, fully supporting his new proposal. This speech was given in June 1965.\n\nThe next four months were filled with a number of unusually vivid dream sequences and even some unusual waking experiences for Schucman. Amongst her vivid dream sequences, she began to become familiar with a certain internal character who spoke to her as Jesus in her dreams. Little did she know that the voice of this dream character would soon come to dominate the rest of her life. Many of her unusual experiences during these four months are recorded in the biographical work, \"Absence from Felicity\", by Kenneth Wapnick. Schucman appears to have confided her experiences with Thetford, who acted as a sort of a calming, encouraging and stabilizing influence for Schucman during this period.\n\nFinally in October of that year, the transcriptions of what is now known as \"A Course In Miracles\" first began. According to both Thetford and Schucman, due to Schucman's intensely divided feelings about the work of the transcription, Schucman would at times require a great deal of reassurance from Thetford in order to complete the process that eventually resulted in the first typewritten copy of \"ACIM\", which later became known as the Urtext.\n\nAccording to Thetford, Schucman was sitting at home on the night of October 21, 1965, when she heard an internal \"voice\" say to her, \"This is a course in miracles. Please take notes.\"\n\nWhen she first heard this internal voice, she thought she recognized it as the same voice of the dream sequence character that in her recent dream sequences had represented the person of Jesus to her. Schucman then wrote down about a page of notes before she realized that this request was going to be of much greater significance, and would require a far greater commitment in time than it had ever asked of her before. In a panic, she phoned Thetford to ask for his advice. Thetford encouraged Schucman to do what the voice asked, and to take the notes. He offered to meet with her the next morning before work, to review her notes, to discuss them further with her, and then to determine what she should do with this \"Voice\".\n\nOn the following morning, after Thetford's review of the notes, he was so impressed with what she read to him that he encouraged Schucman to continue with the note taking. Schucman was initially taken aback by Thetford's reaction, but then apparently after giving herself enough time to recover from her initial jitters to honestly review the notes herself, she agreed. Soon they recognized that the notes, which eventually became \"A Course in Miracles\" (referred to as \"The Course\" by \"ACIM\" students), was their answer, the \"other way\" that they had agreed to find together four months earlier.\n\nClassifying this transcription process as one of Schucman's unusual waking experiences is an understatement at best. During the process Schucman claimed to have the mental equivalent of a tape recorder in her thoughts, which she described as being able to turn on and off at will, at her convenience, so that she might be able to transcribe into shorthand notes, what she was internally hearing. This voice identified itself as none other than the historical Jesus.\n\nDuring the beginning of this process, one of Thetford's gentle complaints was, “In the beginning I spent most of my time while typing these notes with one hand on the typewriter and the other on Helen’s shoulder”. After some months of experiencing an initial struggle in this process, eventually they both began to experience less subconscious resistance to the process, and the initial transcription began to move along more smoothly.\n\nFrom 1965 through 1972 Thetford directly assisted Schucman with the transcription of the first three sections of the work, which was in fact the great bulk of the material. Then in 1972, somewhat to both of their reliefs (yet on some levels to their dismay) it appeared that the writing was complete, which for the most part it was.\n\nIn 1972 Thetford and Schucman were introduced to Kenneth Wapnick through their mutual friend Father Groeshel. Wapnick was intrigued by the manuscript although he soon realized it needed considerable editing to render it into a publishable format. Wapnick urged Helen to go over the manuscript once again with his assistance, which they did, bringing the final editing to a completion in the Spring of 1975. Thetford, Wapnick and Schucman, the three principle transcriber-editors of ACIM were to remain friends for the rest of their lives, throughout the arduous process of seeing this manuscript through to first successful publication, and beyond to witness the initial spreading of its teachings.\n\nAfter the completion of the bulk of the initial scribing/ transcribing process, for brief periods during 1973, 1975, and 1977 the short transcriptions of Psychotherapy, of Clarification of Terms, and of the Song of Prayer, which are the remainder of the standard material of \"ACIM\", were transcribed in similar fashion.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1978 Thetford, along with David Saunders, headed the CIA mind control Project MKULTRA Subproject 130: Personality Theory.\n\nIn 1978 Thetford resigned from his positions at both Columbia University and at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. In 1980 he packed up his household, and at the apparent invitation of Judith Skutch Whitson, moved to Tiburon, California, where Whitson was by now employed full-time in the publication and distribution of \"ACIM\".\n\nNow in Tiburon at age 57, Thetford transitioned into a sort of semi-retirement, no longer accepting any demanding positions of heavy responsibility in either his professional life, or in his involvement with the ever growing readership of \"ACIM\". In California Thetford took on two part-time professional positions; one as a psychology consultant at Travis Air Force Base and the other as one of the directors of the \"ACIM\" related Center for Attitudinal Healing in Tiburon, as offered to him by his friend and fellow student of ACIM, Dr. Gerald Jampolsky.\n\nIn California Thetford spent the final eight years of his life regularly attending meetings of fellow \"ACIM\" students where \"ACIM\" principles would be discussed, but only rarely engaging in these discussions in any kind of an authoritative manner. Instead, during this final period of his life, he appears to have been primarily concerned with his own personal study of the \"ACIM\" material, and with enriching his own grasp of its message.\n\nOn July 4, 1988, at age 65 Thetford died of a massive heart attack.\n\n"}

About 12,000 demonstrators were involved in the protests and over 900 people were detained. 64 policemen and 20 demonstrators were injured in the events.\n\nVarious anti-capitalist protesters were seeing this institutions as one of reasons for the economic problems faced by the third world. Anger was directed against the way the IMF and World Bank pushed for a policy of directing power to the markets and multinational companies. \n\nMost radical activists tried to prevent the opening of the summit by blocking access roads to the Prague Congress Centre. There were barricades in the streets and camouflaged protestors threw Molotov cocktails and cobblestones. There were also reported attacks on journalists and breaking of shop windows in the city center.\n\nTear gas and water cannon were used to force back a breakaway group of activists that attempted to reach the summit venue to shut down the meetings of the global financial institutions. In spite of the large police presence, the protesters succeeded in breaking up the last day of the summit.\n\nAdditionally this action was marked by the emergence of both the \"pink bloc\" and the \"white overall\" tactics used by the Italian radical group \"Ya Basta!\".

He has written over 100 books, including works about human health, politics, cricket, and animal issues, and a range of novels.\n\nIn 1981, Dr Coleman was fined by the DHSS for refusing to write the diagnoses on sick notes, which he considered to be a breach of patient confidentiality. After publishing his first book, \"The Medicine Men\", which accused the NHS of being controlled by pharmaceutical companies, he left the NHS to focus on his writing.\n\nHis books have appeared on several bestseller lists, including \"The Sunday Times\". \"Life Without Tranquillisers\" reached the Top Ten of \"The Sunday Times\" in March 1985. \nHis book \"Bodypower\" reached several bestseller lists in the UK.\n\nHis novel \"Mrs Caldicot's Cabbage War\" was turned into a movie with the same name.\n\nColeman has been censured by the Press Complaints Commission and banned by the Advertising Standards Authority.\n\nIn 1994, a High Court judge granted a temporary injunction preventing Coleman from publishing the home address or telephone number of Sir Colin Blakemore, who had been targeted by anti-vivisection activists. He also agreed not to publish anything about Professor Blakemore that might jeopardize his safety, and to give solicitors the names of anyone he may have already passed the information to.\n\nColeman was born in 1946, the son of an electrical engineer. He grew up an only child, in Walsall, West Midlands, England, where he attended Queen Mary's Grammar School.\n\nAs a child he was unsure what he wanted to do, but then, according to \"The Independent\" in 2008, he said he \"met a friend of the family when I was about 12 who said, if you're a lawyer you spend your life making people unhappy, and if you're a doctor you spend your life trying to make people happy.\"\n\nBefore going to medical school, Coleman worked in 1964 and 1965 as a volunteer in Kirkby, Liverpool, getting children to paint old people's houses and doing their shopping. According to Coleman, \"The unions threatened to strike, as they were taking away work, but...work that they weren't doing anyway...\"\n\nColeman qualified as a doctor in 1970 and worked as a GP. He is no longer registered and licensed to practise as a GP principal having relinquished registration as of 31 Mar 2006. An anti-vivisectionist, he has been a witness at the House of Lords on vivisection.\n\nA 1989 editorial in the \"British Medical Journal\" criticised his comments on leprosy after it was announced that Diana, Princess of Wales was to shake hands with a leper. The incident was covered on Channel 4's \"Hard News\", but Coleman declined to appear unless paid a fee because of travel costs.\n\nIn November 1989 he wrote an article published in \"The Sun\" under the headline \"AIDS—THE HOAX OF THE CENTURY\" which claimed that there was a conspiracy to present AIDS as a syndrome that could affect heterosexuals as well as homosexuals.\n\n\"How to Stop Your Doctor Killing You\" came out in 1996, and then again in 2003. \n\nAfter publishers refused to publish \"Alice's Diary\" and certain other of his books, he decided to begin self-publishing.\n\nHe has also written under the pen name Edward Vernon. In the late 1970s, he wrote three novels about life as a GP: \"Practice makes Perfect\", \"Practise What you Preach\" and \"Getting into Practice\". Coleman (who uses a number of other pen names) says that the books are novels and not autobiographical and that the pen name was used on the advice of his literary agent for purely practical reasons.\n\nHe resigned from the \"People\" in 2003.\n\nIn 2005 the Advertising Standards Authority responded to an advertisement for a book by Vernon Coleman that read \"The person most likely to kill you is not a burglar, a mugger, a deranged relative or a drunken driver. The person most likely to kill you is your doctor. This book explains how to protect yourself from this serious threat to your life and good health.\". The advertisement was for his book \"How To Stop Your Doctor Killing You\". Complainants, including a general medical practitioner challenged whether the advertisement was misleading, particularly the claim \"The person most likely to kill you is your doctor\" were misleading, offensive and denigratory to the medical profession. The advertisers believed that the claim did not breach the CAP code and that the claim was fair. Coleman claimed that doctors were one of the four most common causes of death though precise figures were not available. He claimed that he was trying to help vulnerable people and that the book was honest and helpful. The ASA considered that the advert was likely to offend and denigrate the medical profession and told the advertisers to revise the advert with advice from the CAP Copy Advice team.\n\nThe ASA noted Colemans' comments that the book was designed to help vulnerable people but considered that claims such as \"Ten reasons why you shouldn't trust your doctor\" were irresponsible because they would discourage people from seeking essential medical help. The ASA told the advertisers not to repeat the claims and to consult the CAP Copy Advice team for assistance with future advertising.\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority found that he had made misleading claims about the link between food and cancer.\n\nColeman is married to Donna Antoinette Coleman (born 1972), a co-author with him of \"How To Conquer Health Problems Between Ages 50 and 120\" (2003), and \"Health Secrets Doctors Share With Their Families\" (2005).

The test device was replaced with a TX-24/EC-24 \"Runt II\" bomb which was detonated on May 5, 1954, at Bikini Atoll.\nIt released energy equivalent to 13.5 megatons of TNT, the second-largest yield ever in a U.S. fusion weapon test.\n\nYankee was originally intended to be a test of a TX-16/EC-16, a weaponized version of the large and complex Ivy Mike device. A small number of emergency capability EC-16s were produced, without being tested, to provide a stop-gap thermonuclear weapon capability in response to the Russian nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe test device, code-named \"Jughead\", had been prepared as a backup in case the non-cryogenic Castle Bravo \"Shrimp\" device failed to work.

Like the Mike, Bravo and Romeo tests, a large percentage of the yield was produced by fast fission of the natural uranium tamper. Of the total yield, 7 megatons were from fission; the other 6.5 megatons were from fusion reactions. The high fusion yield was due to the enriched fuel and set a U.S. record that stood until Hardtack Poplar in 1958.\n\n\n"}

Brightness temperatures are processed as quickly as possible and sent to numerical weather prediction (NWP) centers around the world. This data helps keep the assessment of the current state of the atmosphere correct, which in turn helps make predictions more accurate.\n\nLong-term AMSU records are also used in studies of climate.\n\nAMSU-A + AMSU-B have flown together on the 3 NOAA KLM satellites: NOAA-15 (NOAA K), launched May 13, 1998; NOAA-16 (NOAA L), launched September 21, 2000; and NOAA-17 (NOAA M), launched June 24, 2002.\n\nFor NOAA-18 (NOAA N), launched May 20, 2005, AMSU-B was replaced by a similar instrument, the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS).\n\nVersions of AMSU-A also fly on the NASA Aqua Earth science satellite and the EUMETSAT MetOp series. On these spacecraft, AMSU-B is replaced by similar microwave humidity sounders: HSB for Aqua and MHS for MetOp.\n\nThe AMSU was an improvement of the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU), incorporating capabilities of the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU), both of which had flown on TIROS-N in 1978 and continued on the NOAA-6 through NOAA-14 satellites. The next generation in the family is the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), first flown on Suomi-NPP in 2011 and now standard equipment on the JPSS series of satellites, the first of which, NOAA-20, launched in 2017.\n\nAMSUs were manufactured by Aerojet Corporation in Azusa, California. This organization is now part of Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems.\n\nAMSUs are always situated on polar-orbiting satellites in sun-synchronous orbits. This results in their crossing the equator at the same two local solar times every orbit. For example, EOS Aqua crosses the equator in daylight heading north (ascending) at 1:30 pm solar time and in darkness heading south (descending) at 1:30 am solar time.\n\nThe AMSU instruments scan continuously in a \"whisk broom\" mode. During about 6 seconds of each 8-second observation cycle, AMSU-A makes 30 observations at 3.3° steps from −48° to +48°. It then makes observations of a warm calibration target and of cold space before it returns to its original position for the start of the next scan. In these 8 seconds the subsatellite point moves about 45 km, so the next scan will be 45 km further along the track. AMSU-B meanwhile makes 3 scans of 90 observations each, with a spacing of 1.1°.\n\nDuring any given 24-hour period there are approximately 16 orbits. Almost the entire globe is observed in either daylight or nighttime mode, many in both. Polar regions are observed nearly every 100 minutes.\n\nThe AMSU has two sub-instruments, AMSU-A and AMSU-B. AMSU-A has 15 channels between 23.8 and 89 GHz, and is used primarily for measuring atmospheric temperatures (known as \"temperature sounding\"). It has a ground resolution near nadir of 45 km. AMSU-B, with five channels between 89 and 183.3 GHz, has a spatial resolution near nadir of 15 km and is primarily intended for moisture sounding. Spot size of both sub-instruments becomes larger and more elongated toward the edges of the swath. When the two instruments are used together, there are roughly 9 AMSU-B fields-of-view in a 3x3 array corresponding to each AMSU-A field-of-view. This reflects the higher spatial variability of water vapor compared to temperature. HIRS/3 infrared sounders with the same spatial resolution as AMSU-B are also included on NOAA 15–17 satellites and are used together with AMSU-A and AMSU-B. Together the three instruments form ATOVS, the Advanced TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder.\n\nThe Aqua and MetOp AMSU-A instruments are 15-channel microwave sounders designed primarily to obtain temperature profiles in the upper atmosphere (especially the stratosphere) and to provide a cloud-filtering capability for tropospheric temperature observations. The EOS AMSU-A is part of a closely coupled triplet of instruments that include the AIRS and HSB. The MetOp AMSU-A similarly works with HIRS, IASI, and MHS. MHS and HSB are variants on AMSU-B.\n\n\nTable 1 Radiometric characteristics of the AMSU-A (from 3,5). \n\nTable 2 Radiometric characteristics of the AMSU-B (from 4). \n\n"}

In 1820 Haden Edwards and his brother Benjamin acquired a plantation near Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nAfter learning that Mexican authorities were considering opening Mexican Texas to American immigration, Edwards traveled to Mexico City, where he joined forces with Stephen F. Austin, among others, in a 3-year attempt to persuade various Mexican governments to pass a law to allow Americans to settle in Texas.\n\nIn 1824 the Mexican federal government passed a General Colonization Law, which for the first time permitted immigration into Texas. Under the terms of the law, each state would set its own requirements for immigration. On March 24, 1825, Coahuila y Tejas passed a colonization law, authorizing large land grants to \"empresarios\" who would recruit settlers for a particular colony. Many would-be \"empresarios\" had congregated in Mexico to lobby for land grants. Among these was Haden Edwards, an American land speculator who quickly became known for his quick temper and aggressiveness. Despite his abrasive attitude, Edwards was granted a colonization contract on April 14. The contract allowed him to settle 800 families in East Texas. It contained standard language requiring Edwards to recognize all pre-existing Spanish and Mexican land titles in his grant area, to raise a militia to protect the settlers in the area, and to allow the state land commissioner to certify all deeds that Edwards would award.\n\nEdwards's colony encompassed the land from the Navasota River to 20 leagues west of the Sabine River, and from 20 leagues north of the Gulf of Mexico to 15 leagues north of the town of Nacogdoches. To the west and north of the colony were lands controlled by several native tribes which had recently been driven out of the United States. The southern boundary was a colony belonging to Stephen F. Austin, the first \"empresario\" in Texas; he had received special permission to establish his colony several years previously. East of Edwards's grant was the former Sabine Free State, a neutral zone which had been essentially lawless for several decades.\n\nEdwards arrived in Nacogdoches in August 1825. Under the mistaken belief that he was authorized to determine the validity of pre-existing land deeds, in September Edwards posted notices alerting all residents that they must provide written proof of their ownership or their land would be forfeited and sold at auction. None of the English-speaking residents had valid titles; those who had not arrived as filibusters had been duped by land speculators. Most of the Spanish-speaking landowners were unable to find documentation that their families might have received 70 or more years previously. Edwards's goal was to remove many of the less-prosperous settlers and assign their lands to wealthy planters from the southern United States. A wealthy planter himself, Edwards scorned the residents who were poorer or of a different race than himself. Anticipating that there might be conflict between the new \"empresario\" and the long-time residents of the area, municipality acting \"alcalde\" Luis Procela and the municipality clerk, Jose Antonio Sepulveda, began validating old Spanish and Mexican land titles. Edwards accused the men of forging deeds. It is likely that both Edwards and the municipality authorities were in the wrong; the state land commissioner had been given authority to validate existing land titles.\n\nThe settlers protested to Political Chief Saucedo. In June 1826 Mexican President Guadalupe Victoria annulled Edward’s contract and expelled him from Mexico. Word traveled slowly. On November 22, 1826, thirty-six armed men who supported Edwards, arrested the anti-Edwards alcalde Samuel Norris and other officials. The party then arrested Jose Antonio Sepulveda, the commander of Nacogdoches’ tiny Mexican militia.\n\nOn December 16, 1826 the rebels rode into Nacogdoches and raised a flag of independence. On December 21, 1826 Edwards signed a document declaring the Republic of Fredonia, which would comprise land from the Sabine River to the Rio Grande. On December 13, 1826 Mexican Colonel Mateo Ahumada and Saucedo moved against the Texas rebels. Austin rallied the other colonist against Edwards and his attempt at open rebellion. Austin offered to negotiate with Edwards, but he refused. On January 22, 1827 Colonel Ahumada moved towards Nacogdoches. All was not going well inside the Edwards camp either. There was internal fighting and the rebellion weakened. With the advancing Mexican and Anglo troops Edwards fled to Louisiana for safety on January 28, 1827. He returned to Texas during the Texas Revolution, participated in the battle of Nacogdoches in 1832 and made his home in Nacogdoches until his death, on August 14, 1849.\n\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks. WSFJ-TV's studios are located on North Central Drive in Lewis Center, and its transmitter is located on Twin Rivers Drive near downtown Columbus.\n\nWSFJ-TV began operations on March 9, 1980. Originally licensed to Newark, another Columbus suburb, it was the first independent television station in Columbus, and the first new commercial station in the area since 1949. On paper, Columbus had grown large enough to support an independent station as far back as the late 1960s. However, the Columbus area is a very large market geographically, stretching across a large swath of central Ohio. The only available full-power allocations in the market were on UHF, and UHF stations do not carry well across large blocks of territory. By the late 1970s, cable television had gained enough penetration to make an independent station viable. Prior to the arrival of WSFJ, Columbus-area cable systems imported the signals of independents from nearby areas, such as WXIX-TV in Cincinnati, WUAB in Cleveland and WTTV in Indianapolis.\n\nThe new station ran only Christian programs, including \"The PTL Club\", Jimmy Swaggart, \"The 700 Club\", \"Another Life\", and children's programming. In the fall of 1980, WSFJ began running secular programming such as \"Independent Network News\" and \"New Zoo Revue\" during the weekdays, along with \"Wild Kingdom\" and other hunting and wildlife shows on Saturdays. However, the schedule remained predominantly Christian, and its policy regarding secular programming was very conservative so as not to offend the sensibilities of its mostly fundamentalist and Pentecostal viewership. It was the only over-the-air source of non-network programming in central Ohio until WTTE (channel 28) signed on in 1984.\n\nIn February 1999, the station affiliated with Pax TV (later i: Independent Television, now Ion Television), running the network's programming from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and again from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. WSFJ also began to be seen on a translator in Columbus, WCPX-LP (channel 48), which was owned by Pax's parent company, Paxson Communications (now Ion Media Networks). Before this, Pax programming was seen overnights on WWHO, a WB affiliate then owned by the Paramount Stations Group. WSFJ was the largest Ion affiliate owned by a company other than Ion Media Networks. While WSFJ was affiliated with Pax, WCMH-TV (channel 4), the local NBC owned-and-operated station, reaired their \"NewsChannel 4\" newscasts on channel 51, as part of an agreement with NBC and Pax. \nWSFJ was sold to Guardian Enterprise Group in 2004. In 2005, WSFJ began to acquire some family-friendly programming separate from its affiliation with Pax/i and rebranded the station as \"GTN51\"—short for \"Guardian Television Network.\" Guardian Enterprise Group was located in the same office as WSFJ. Other companies under the Guardian Enterprise Group include Guardian Studios and Guardian Human Resources.\n\nIn March 2007, WSFJ moved its master control and studio into a facility at Easton Town Center, which generated the content that was sent to their new digital transmission facility in Pataskala, off of SR 161. That year, WSFJ launched its digital signal on channel 24.\n\nIon sold WCPX-LP in 2007, and in January 2008 it was relaunched as an Azteca América affiliate. At the same time, Ion programming disappeared from WSFJ, leaving it exclusively with family entertainment, religious shows, and paid programming. Ion's main program feed would later resurface in the market on the third subchannel of WCMH-TV.\n\nIn July 2008, it was announced that Guardian would sell WSFJ to the Trinity Broadcasting Network for $16 million. Guardian retained its other properties, including the then-upcoming \".2 Network\", and acquired W23BZ, which had been a low-power repeater of TBN; it picked up WSFJ's programming when channel 51 began carrying TBN programming on October 1, 2008. However, by selling off its full-powered station and getting a low-powered signal, GTN would find themselves at a disadvantage—being on a low-power signal, it lost its must-carry status; as a result, Guardian urged viewers to contact their cable systems to pick up GTN after the move to channel 23.\n\nAs a TBN-owned station, WSFJ served as a pass-through for the TBN national feed with virtually no local programming. TBN has long been known for buying existing stations in order to get must-carry status on local cable systems. In 2011, the station began work on a new television studio in Lewis Center, Ohio in Delaware County.\n\nTBN entered into an option agreement with Ion Media Networks on November 14, 2017, which gave Ion the option to acquire the licenses of WSFJ-TV and three other TBN stations serving Ohio and Indiana–WDLI-TV in Canton, WKOI-TV in the Dayton area, and WCLJ-TV in Indianapolis–all of whom had sold their spectrum in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s incentive auction; Ion exercised the option on May 24, 2018. The sale was completed on September 25, 2018 and the next day, all TBN programming was dropped for Ion Life (now Ion Plus), which had not been carried in the Columbus market previously. Ion Media has pursued a new strategy since 2018 of giving Ion Life a primary channel placement (mainly involving purchases and shuffles related to the incentive auction) in order to require local cable and satellite providers to offer the channel under must-carry provisions. Ion Television is already available in the Columbus market on cable and satellite via its national feed; WCMH-DT3's Ion feed is not carried on any local pay TV providers.\n\nFor some time after TBN took over the station, WSFJ did not multiplex its signal, unlike the other TBN-owned stations. However, in July 2012, WSFJ upgraded its studios and equipment, and carried the TBN affiliated subchannels seen on all other full power TBN stations until September 2018.\n\nWSFJ-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 51, on April 16, 2009, the date TBN-owned full-power stations permanently ceased analog transmissions. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 24, using PSIP to display WSFJ-TV's virtual channel as channel 51 on digital television receivers.\n\n"}

It was originally owned by the MacCullochs of Myreton. They abandoned the castle in the late 17th century, following the execution of Sir Godfrey McCulloch for the murder of a Clan Gordon neighbour. It is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland, and is a scheduled monument.\n\nAround 1170 the lands of Anwoth were granted by Malcolm IV to David fitz Teri, a Cumbrian lord, who built a motte-and-bailey castle at Boreland, close to the present castle. In 1220 a Nicholas de Kerdenes and his wife Cicely were in dispute with the monastery at Dundrennan over Cicely's dowry—he eventually appealed to the Pope. In 1277, Bertram de Kerdennes was a witness to a charter by King Alexander III (reigned 1249–1286), confirming a grant by Devorguilla de Balliol to Glasgow Cathedral. On 18 June 1342 Malcolm Fleming, Earl of Wigtown, was granted a charter of the lands of Cardoness, in Galloway, from King David II in excambion (exchange) for the lands of Mochrum which the King had formerly given him. He was also granted other lands in Wigtownshire.\n\nThe lands of Cardoness were in the McCulloch family by 1466. Writing in 1864, Sir Andrew Agnew recorded a local tradition relating how the McCullochs came to possess Cardoness:\n\nThe McCulloch lairds built the present Cardoness Castle in the late 15th century. In the 1560s, an English spy reported on the castle to Elizabeth I of England, in preparation for a planned invasion of Scotland that never took place. In 1622 the Gordons of Ardwall acquired the mortgaged estate. Feuding between the McCullochs and the Gordons culminated in 1690 when Sir Godfrey McCulloch shot dead William Gordon of Buck o'Bield. Sir Godfrey escaped to France, but was spotted in Edinburgh in 1697 and beheaded on the Maiden, the Scottish equivalent of the guillotine. It was subsequently uninhabited, and passed through the hands of a number of owners before being placed in state care in 1927. It has been protected as a scheduled monument since 1928, and is now maintained by Historic Environment Scotland. The castle is open to the public.\n\n"}

He was born in Nashville, Tennessee during the height of Jesse James' career as an outlaw. His mother was Zerelda, Jesse James' wife and first cousin.\n\nJames was named after his father and American Outlaw Jesse James. He went by the name of Tim Edwards in his youth to conceal his relationship to his father. After his father's death, James and his family lived in Kansas City and were taken under the wing of Thomas T. Crittenden Jr., the son of Governor Thomas Theodore Crittenden, who had signed what would become the death warrant of the outlaw Jesse James. In 1898 James was arrested, and stood trial in 1899, for the robbery of a Missouri Pacific train, but was acquitted.\n\nJames married Stella Frances McGowan (Feb 27, 1882 – Jan 1, 1951) on January 2, 1900 in the parlor of his mother's home, though she was too sick to attend the wedding.\n\nThe couple had four daughters:\n\nThe Jameses moved to Los Angeles, California, in the 1920s, where for a time they ran a restaurant called \"The Jesse James Inn\", and remained in California until his death in 1951.\n\nFollowing his acquittal for train robbery, James wrote a book, \"Jesse James, My Father\" (), which was published in 1899.\n\nHe owned a pawn shop in Kansas City while studying law.

{"id": "2194732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194732", "title": "Spanish missions in Texas", "text": "Spanish missions in Texas\n\nThe Spanish Missions in Texas comprise a series of religious outposts established by Spanish Catholic Dominicans, Jesuits, and Franciscans to spread the Catholic doctrine among area Native Americans, but with \nthe added benefit of giving Spain a toehold in the frontier land. The missions introduced European livestock, fruits, vegetables, and industry into the Texas area. In addition to the \"presidio\" (fortified church) and \"pueblo\" (town), the \"misión\" was one of the three major agencies employed by the Spanish crown to extend its borders and consolidate its colonial territories. In all, twenty-six missions were maintained for different lengths of time within the future boundaries of the state of Texas.\n\nSince 1493, Spain had maintained missions throughout New Spain (Mexico and portions of what today are the southwestern United States) to facilitate colonization. The eastern Tejas missions were a direct response to fear of French encroachment when the remains of La Salle's Fort Saint Louis were discovered near Matagorda Bay in 1689, and a response to the first permanent French outposts along the Gulf Coast ten years later.\n\nFollowing government policy, Franciscan missionaries sought to make life within mission communities closely resemble that of Spanish villages and Spanish culture. To become Spanish citizens and \"productive\" inhabitants, Native Americans learned vocational skills, such as plows, farm implements, and gear for horses, oxen, and mules fell into disrepair, blacksmithing skills soon became indispensable. Weaving skills were needed to help clothe the inhabitants. As buildings became more elaborate, mission occupants learned masonry and carpentry under the direction of craftsmen contracted by the missionaries.\n\nIn the closely supervised setting of the mission the Native Americans were expected to mature in Christianity and Spanish political and economic practices until they would no longer require special mission status. Then their communities could be incorporated as such into ordinary colonial society. This transition from official mission status to ordinary Spanish society, when it occurred in an official manner, was called \"secularization.\" In this official transaction, the mission's communal properties were privatized, the direction of civil life became a purely secular affair, and the direction of church life was transferred from the missionary religious orders to the Catholic diocesan church. Although colonial law specified no precise time for this transition to take effect, increasing pressure for the secularization of most missions developed in the last decades of the 18th century.\n\nThis mission system was developed in response to the often very detrimental results of leaving the Hispanic control of relations with Native Americans on the expanding frontier to overly enterprising civilians and soldiers. This had resulted too often in the abuse and even enslavement of the Indians and a heightening of antagonism.\n\nIn the end, the mission system was not politically strong enough to protect the Native Americans against the growing power of ranchers and other business interests that sought control over mission lands and the manpower represented by the Native Americans. In the first few years of the new Republic of Mexico-between 1824 and 1830-all the missions still operating in Texas were officially secularized, with the sole exception of those in the El Paso district, which were turned over to diocesan pastors only in 1852.\n\nSpanish Texas was a part of New Spain. On its southern edge, Texas was bordered by the province of Coahuila. The boundary between the provinces was set at the line formed by the Medina and the Nueces Rivers, northeast of the Rio Grande. On the east, Texas bordered French Louisiana. Although Spain claimed that the Red River formed the boundary between the two, France insisted that the border was the Sabine River, to the west.\n\nThe first mission established within the boundaries of Spanish Texas was San Francisco de la Espada. In 1689, Spanish authorities found the remnants of a French settlement, Fort Saint Louis. \n\nDuring their expedition, the Spanish met representatives of the Caddo people, who lived between the Trinity and the Red Rivers. The Caddo expressed interest in learning about Christianity, and the following year Alonso De León led an expedition to establish a mission in East Texas. It was completed near the Hasinai village of Nabedaches in late May, and its first mass was conducted on June 1, 1690.\n\nIn its first two years of existence, the mission faced much hardship, as floodwaters and then drought destroyed their crops. After an epidemic killed half of the local population, the Hasinai became convinced that the missionaries had caused the deaths. Fearing an attack, on October 25, 1693 the missionaries buried the mission bell, set the building ablaze, and retreated to Mexico.\n\nThe mission was reestablished on July 3, 1716, as Nuestro Padre San Francisco de los Tejas. In 1721, it was renamed Mission San Francisco de los Neches. It was moved in 1731 to San Antonio where it was named Mission San Francisco de la Espada. The surviving structure is now part of San Antonio Missions National Historical Park operated by the National Park Service. A commemorative representation of Mission San Francisco de los Tejas, is located in Weches at Mission Tejas State Park.\n\nMission Santísimo Nombre de María was the second mission established by the Spanish in East Texas. Built for the native Neches population, the mission opened in September 1690 northeast of Mission San Francisco. The mission consisted of a straw chapel and a house for the priest. It was destroyed by a flood in 1692.\n\nMission San Juan Capistrano had been known as Mission San José de los Nazonis in East Texas. When the mission was relocated to San Antonio in 1731, it was renamed so as not to cause confusion with Mission San José y San Miguel de Aguayo. Located south of Mission San José, San Juan Capistrano served Coahuiltecan natives. It was the most distant of the missions from the presidio at Bexar and was often raided by Apaches.\n\nBy 1762, the mission consisted of a stone chapel with stone rooms for the priests and the soldiers who lived at the mission. Rooms made of adobe were built along the walls to house the 200 resident Native American peoples. The mission was secularized in 1794, with the property divided among the remaining mission Indians. A priest continued to hold church services there, but other mission activities ended. The church has been restored and is still an active parish.\n\nThis mission was originally established on the Angelina River in East Texas in 1716 as Mission Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de los Ainais. It served the Ainais tribe. It was closed because of the French threat and reopened in 1721. In 1730, it moved temporarily to present-day Austin before moving to San Antonio in 1731, where it was renamed Mission Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de Acuña. The name was changed because the mission no longer served the Ainais tribe, and its new name honored the current viceroy of Mexico.\n\nThe mission inherited the lands of the closed Mission San Franscisco Xavier de Najera south of San Antonio de Valero. Most of the Native Americans at the mission were Coahuiltecans who disliked the hard work of mission life. The Native Americans often ran away and were brought back forcibly by soldiers or priests.\n\nThe current church building was completed in 1755 and is the oldest unrestored stone church in the United States. It is built in the shape of a cross, with walls that are thick. The mission was closed in 1794, with the property divided among the resident Native Americans, all of whom has left by 1800. For a time, the buildings were used as a cattle barn, but in 1855 the land and church were given to the Brothers of Mary, who cleaned it and began conducting services again. It is now open to the public for prayer, and is part of the National Park Service.\n\nMission San José de los Nazonis was the third mission established in East Texas in 1716. Located near a Nazoni village, the mission was near the present-day site of Cushing, Texas. Although the mission closed after the French took the presidio at Los Adaes, it was reopened several years later by the Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo. In 1730, it was moved temporarily to what is now Austin, Texas near Barton Springs only for a few months before being permanently relocated to San Antonio, where it became known as San Juan Capistrano.\n\nMission Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe was established in 1756 in central Texas near present-day New Braunfels, Texas to serve the local Waco and Tonkawa tribes congregating near the headwaters of the Comal river. It was closed in 1758 because of perceived Comanche depredations and was never protected by a complementing presidio garrison.\n\nMission Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de los Nacogdoches was established in 1716 in East Texas to serve the Nacogdoche tribe. It closed several years later because of threats from French Louisiana but reopened in 1721. The mission continued until 1773, when the Spanish government ordered all of East Texas to be abandoned. In 1779, Antonio Gil Y'Barbo led a group of settlers who had been removed from Los Adaes to the area to settle in the empty mission buildings. This began the town of Nacogdoches, Texas.\n\nMission Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de los Ais was originally established in 1717 in the area of Ayish Bayou (modern San Augustine, Texas) by Father Antonio Margil de Jesus. The mission was built to convert the local Ais Native Americans. Following the Chicken War in 1719, Spanish officials closed the East Texas missions and Father Margil and others were relocated to San Antonio. During the next year, Father Margil founded Mission San José (Texas). Mission Dolores was reestablished in 1721. Missionaries continued their work until 1773 when the East Texas missions were once again closed. \n\nArcheologists confirmed the location of the mission in the late 1970s. It is one of three archeologically confirmed mission locations in East Texas and the only site open to the public. The City of San Augustine constructed a museum, campground and archeology lab in 2000. Since July 1, 2016 the Texas Historical Commission has operated the site as Mission Dolores State Historic Site. \n\nMission San Miguel de Linares de los Adaes was the fifth mission established in East Texas in 1716–1717. The mission was to serve the Native American village of Adaes just west of the French fort at Natchitoches, Louisiana. At that time, the Spanish claimed the Red River as the eastern boundary of Texas, so the mission was considered part of Spanish Texas, despite being in what is now considered Louisiana.\n\nThe mission was attacked by French soldiers in 1719 and was closed. Three years later, the Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo reopened the mission, but at a site closer to the Presidio of Los Adaes. The mission remained open until 1773.\n\nMission San Antonio de Valero was established on May 1, 1718, as the first Spanish mission along the San Antonio River. It was named for San Antonio de Padua, the patron saint of the mission's founder, Father Antonio de Olivares as well as for the viceroy of New Spain, the Marquis de Valero. The mission later became known as the Alamo.\n\nIts first location was west of San Pedro Springs, and after being moved several times, it was finally established above a bend in the San Antonio River, where it would be easy to defend. The early mission buildings were made of grass, and the first stone building was built in 1727. The building now known as the Alamo was not built until 1744, and most of its actual structure does not remain. The mission eventually grew to include a granary, workhouse, and rooms for the priests, native peoples, and soldiers. To protect from frequent Apache raids, a wall surrounded the buildings. Outside the wall were farmlands and ranches owned by the mission.\n\nThe mission served the Coahuiltecan Native Americans until 1793, when mission activities ended. At that time the land and livestock were divided among the thirty-nine Indians remaining at the mission. The buildings later served as a home for a Mexican army unit before becoming a military hospital in 1806. During the Texas Revolution, the buildings served as the site of the Battle of the Alamo, and during the Mexican–American War supplies for the U.S. Army were stored there. The buildings are now owned by the state of Texas and operated as memorial by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas.\n\n Shortly after its founding, Mission San Antonio de Valero became overcrowded with refugees from the closed East Texas missions, and Father Antonio Margil received permission from the governor of Coahuila and Texas, the Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo, to build a new mission. On February 23, 1720, the new mission, San José y San Miguel de Aguayo was established south of San Antonio de Valero. Like San Antonio de Valero, Mission San José served the Coahuiltecan natives. The first buildings, made of brush, straw, and mud, were quickly replaced by large stone structures, including guest rooms, offices, a dining room, and a pantry. A heavy outer wall was built around the main part of the mission, and rooms for 350 Indians were built into the walls.\n\nA new church, which still stands, was constructed in 1768 from local limestone. The mission lands were given to its Indians in 1794, and mission activities officially ended in 1824. After that, the buildings were home to soldiers, the homeless, and bandits. It was restored in the 1930s and is now a state and national historic site.\n\n\nMission San Francisco Xavier de Nájera was established in 1722 in San Antonio, as a result of a promise made by the Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo, the governor of Spanish Texas. The previous year, Aguayo had asked the El Cuilón (also known as Juan Rodriguez) the chief of the Ervipiame and influential among many of the other tribes of Rancheria Grande natives, such as the Yojuanes and the Mayeye to guide him to East Texas to reopen the missions there; in return, Aguayo promised to open a mission along the San Antonio River for the chief's tribe. The new mission was established south of San Antonio de Valero and was initially populated by fifty families under the leadership of El Cuilón. The families did not stay long, and by 1726 the mission closed. Its lands were later given to Mission Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de Acuña.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Leichte Infanterie Division\") was a light infantry division of the German Army during World War II. As such, it was provided with partial horse or motor transport and lighter artillery. Light divisions were reduced in size compared to standard infantry divisions. The Walloon Legion was briefly attached to this division from January 1942 to May 1942. During the latter stages of the war, the division was composed of members from most of Germany's geographic areas and many German-speaking Walloons (Belgian/French).\n\nThe main purpose of the German \"Jäger\" Divisions was to fight in adverse terrain where smaller, coordinated formations were more facilely combat capable than the brute force offered by their standard infantry counterparts. The \"Jäger\" divisions were more heavily equipped than the mountain \"Gebirgsjäger\" equivalents, but not as well armed as a larger infantry division. In the early stages of the war, it was the interface divisions fighting in rough terrain and foothills as well as urban areas, between the mountains and the plains. The \"Jägers\" (means \"hunters\" in German) relied on a high degree of training, and slightly superior communications, as well as their not inconsiderable artillery support. In the middle stages of the war, as the standard infantry divisions were downsized, the Jäger structure of divisions with two infantry regiments, became the standard table of organization.\n\nIn 1944, Adolf Hitler declared that all infantry divisions were now \"Volksgrenadier\" Divisions except for his elite \"Jäger\" and Mountain \"Jäger\" divisions.\n\nInitially established in December 1940 as the 100th Light Infantry Division, the unit was raised in Upper Austria, and based in Ried. The 54th \"Jäger\" Regiment was detached from the 18th Infantry. The division comprised two-thirds Austrian and one-third Silesian men.\n\nThe 100th Light Infantry Division's first campaign as a fighting force was Operation \"Barbarossa\", the invasion of the Soviet Union, where it served with the 17th Army in the Southern Sector. Its first campaign was in the Battle of Uman, followed by action at Kiev and Odessa.\n\nIn October, the 369th Reinforced Croatian Infantry Regiment was attached to the division to bolster its size when attacking the Eastern Front.\n\nThe formation was the only German \"Jäger\" Division that fought at the Battle of Stalingrad. The 100th Light Infantry Division, along with the 369th Reinforced Croatian Infantry Regiment, was virtually destroyed at Stalingrad.\n\nThe 100th \"Jäger\" Division was reestablished and fought partisans in the Balkans, Croatia, Albania, and was deployed on coastal protection duties in the Strait of Otranto.\n\n\n\n"}

When another press arrived in 1800 the newspaper the \"Sierra Leone Advertiser\" began being printed.\n\nAdvances in satellite communication, and its availability in Africa (some countries on the continent have their own communications satellites) has meant that some local television stations are now viewed outside their terrestrial broadcast areas. Submarine fibre cables are gradually changing the face of communications in Africa and bringing faster and more reliable Internet connectivity to most countries on the continent. The challenge is to continue the advance of fibre inland. Much of the fibre being laid is without redundancy, so it is great when it works, but there is always the concern that you need satellite back up.\n\nVSAT Providers covering Africa Onlime GmbH (www.onlime.com)\n\nDigital media and internet are increasingly part of the African media landscape. One specific development worth mentioning, is the rise of mobile reporting. Journalists across the continent are increasingly using the mobile phone as their primary reporting tool needed to collect text, photo and video. This content is often distributed via the internet and is an early example of convergence in the internet and mobile medium.\n\nPan African community based websites are also emerging on the scene and reflect trends in the Web 2.0 movement seen in other parts of the world.\n\nA 24-hour pan-African news and information channel called A24 will start broadcasting from Nairobi in 2008 by satellite and the internet.\n\nHistorically, Nigeria has boasted one of the most free and resilient newspaper presses of any African country, even under its past military dictatorships, most of whom have shown an intolerance of the press. In the rest of the continent, vibrant journalism is also getting to be the order of the day. As in more developed countries, many journalists, in a bid to uphold the integrity of the profession, have preferred to go to jail rather than betray the confidentiality of a source.\n\nIn 2005, journalists representing 23 African nations met in Cameroon and established the Society for the Development of Media in Africa (Société pour le Développement des Médias Africains, SDMA).\n\nArticles on the media of each African country appear with the title \"Media of [name of country]\", for example: Media of Nigeria, Media of Côte d'Ivoire, Media of Burkina Faso.\n\n"}

The character first appeared in \"Brave and the Bold\" #28 (February–March 1960), and was created by Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky.\n\nStarro is the first villain to face the original Justice League of America. Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the character has appeared in both comic books and other DC Comics-related products, such as animated television series and videogames.\n\nThe character debuted in \"The Brave and the Bold\" #28 (Feb.-March 1960) in a story titled \"Starro the Conqueror\", which was also the first appearance of the \"Justice League of America\". According to editor Julius Schwartz, the title “Starro the Conqueror\" was inspired by a Ray Cumming’s story, “Tarrano the Conqueror”. Starro reappeared in an 11-page Aquaman story in \"Adventure Comics\" #451 (May–June 1977) and a two-part story in \"Justice League of America\" #189–190 (April–May 1981).\n\nThe character returned in an alternate universe story in \"Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!\" #1 (March 1982) and appeared briefly in \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" #9 (Dec. 1985).\n\nIn the post-Crisis DC universe, Starro appeared in a five-part story in \"Justice League Europe\" #24–28 (March–July 1991) and was revamped and reintroduced in \"JLA Secret Files\" #1 (Sept. 1997) and \"JLA\" #22–23 (Sept. – Oct. 1998). Another version featured in the intercompany crossover \"JLA/Avengers\" #1–4 (Sept. 2003 – May 2004); \"Teen Titans\" vol. 3, #51–54 (Nov. 2007 – Feb. 2008) and \"Green Lantern/Sinestro Corps: Secret Files\" #1 (Feb. 2008) and \"Booster Gold\" #13–14 (Dec. 2008 – Jan. 2009).\n\nIn post-\"Infinite Crisis\" DC continuity, the character appeared in \"R.E.B.E.L.S\" #1–13 (April 2009 – April 2010) and \"R.E.B.E.L.S\" Annual #1 (Dec. 2009). Another version appears in \"Forever Evil \" #1 (Nov. 2013). and a version called a \"Genetically Modified Starro\" appeared in New Super-Man #4 in 2016.\n\nStarro is an intelligent alien lifeform resembling a giant starfish with a central eye and prehensile extremities. The entity visited Earth and empowered three starfish, the creatures wreaking havoc (exploding an atom bomb and absorbing its energy; kidnapping scientists and absorbing their brain power and placing the residents of Happy Harbor and Rhode Island under mental control) until stopped by heroes Aquaman, Flash (Barry Allen), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Martian Manhunter, and Wonder Woman. Starro was defeated by coating it with quicklime, which nullified the entity's abilities. A segment of that Starro survived, and regenerated into a complete creature, but was stopped by Aquaman before being able to renew its plan of conquest.\n\nStarro eventually reappeared, and forced humans to nurture it until it was able to assume its former proportions. Being able to asexually spawn, Starro created millions of miniature duplicate \"spores\" of itself, which attached to the faces of the entire population of New York and rendered them under his mental control. Starro used these spores to control several members of the Justice League until defeated by extreme cold. When Superman investigates a strange phenomenon causing the citizens of Metropolis to begin acting like apes, he is accidentally transported to an alternate universe and arrives on the parallel Earth called Earth-C. Meeting sentient superpowered animals called Captain Carrot and his Amazing Zoo Crew, Superman aids the animal heroes to defeat Starro, who has established a base on the Earth-C universe's version of the planet Pluto. Superman then takes the defeated Starro back to his universe.\n\nStarro later convinces Justice League Europe that it is dying and wishes to return to space. Aided by ex-Green Lantern Kilowog, Starro returns to his original ship, which, once repaired, is launched out of Earth's atmosphere. Starro, however, betrays the Justice League when it programs the vessel to explode, freeing Starro from its body and releasing thousands of smaller \"spore\" versions over Western Europe. Assuming control of thousands of humans, Starro seizes power, with several members of Justice League Europe opposing the alien. Starro is finally defeated when Justice League member Ice freezes the original creature.\n\nReferring to itself only as \"It\", a different version of Starro takes control of the Flash (Wally West) and the population of Blue Valley using spores. Although the JLA intend to intervene, they are advised against doing so by the Spectre (Hal Jordan), who reveals the alien's intention is to capture and control the heroes and use them to form an army to conquer the galaxy. The JLA request the Spectre temporarily remove their powers—thus eliminating the potential threat they may pose—allowing them to distract the entity while Batman disables it with extreme cold.\nThis version returns and is revealed to be a scout for a huge version of the creature called the \"Star Conqueror\". Covering Europe with its body, the entity psychically enslaves the human race while they sleep. Dream of the Endless aids the JLA, with several members battling the entity in the dreamworld whilst another small team is attacking its physical form. Assisted by a homeless man resisting the entity's control, the heroes free mankind from the alien's influence. Dream captures the Star Conqueror and stores the entity with his other keepsakes.\n\nIn the DC/Marvel Comics crossover \"JLA/Avengers\", Starro battles the alternate universe superhero team the Avengers.\n\nDuring the \"Infinite Crisis\", Starro appears as a member of Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains. Starro eventually returns to Earth-C (now called Earth-26) to spark a conflict between aquatic and terrestrial creatures. Despite the efforts of the Zoo Crew, Starro floods the planet and defeats the team. They are then transported off world with the surviving refugees by another animal team, Just'a Lotta Animals. Zoo Crew member Pig Iron apparently sacrifices himself and battles Starro underwater as they escape. Starro reappears as a member of the Sinestro Corps, wielding five power rings and controlling several supervillains. The entity is destroyed by a future version of the Flash (Bart Allen).\n\nIt is eventually revealed that Starro belonged to a race of parasites that conquered planets with \"motherstars\" that released spores to take mental control of a population. When a motherstar arrived on the planet Hatorei and enslaved its psychically gifted native humanoids, a sole survivor takes control of an infant Starro queen, allowing him to mentally dominate the entire parasitic race. Assuming the name \"Starro the Conqueror\" the being is empowered by a huge army of drone soldiers controlled by spores, allowing him to conquer entire galaxies. A human possessed by Starro is later seen amongst the villains recruited in the Secret Society.\n\nThe Prime Earth version of Starro is recruited to join Team Mystery to protect the universe against the Omega Titans. Convinced of the virtues of heroism by his teammate Martian Manhunter, Starro dies in battle with the Omega Titans .\n\nBatman preserves a tissue sample which grows into a new individual who Batman dubs 'Jarro', raising him as a son and even taking him on as a new Robin.\n\nA future version of Starro mentally enthralls the Time Master Rip Hunter, using his time-travelling technology to retroactively conquer Earth. With the assistance of the villain Lady Chronos, hero Booster Gold is able to restore the timeline.\n\nAt another point in a future time, a giant Starro spore had been indoctrinated into the Sinestro Corps. Wielding five yellow power rings and hosting a number of supervillains pertaining to Livewire, Prometheus and Brimstone among others opposing the Titans Tomorrows past counterparts.\n\nStarro is an alien amalgamate conqueror with both a humanoid central mind commanding spores which resemble either giant or small terran starfish. An asexual creature, Starro's spores are capable of generating clones that act in accordance with the original's will. The clones are parasites by nature, and can attach themselves to a humanoid's face, and subsequently take control of the host's central nervous system, thereby controlling the host. Control of the host is lost once removed from the victim.\n\nBoth variants of the parasite are capable of energy absorption/projection; flight; changing color and self regeneration while the larger ones have a high degree of invulnerability, the giant versions also have much more potent mental capabilities being able to indirectly influence the minds of a potential host race, capable of lulling countless people into an induced slumber and accessing their thoughts via dreams. Their size can also vary from being as big as city blocks to larger than a small planetary ocean body, in which case said Starro probe can radically alter the very climate, topography and geography within their vicinity akin to terraforming. A future Starr conqueror spore eventually comes to weaponize 5 Qwardian power rings on each of its pointed tentacles, the ring can create objects based on the wielder's thoughts but only those fuelled by fear instead of willpower. Given the difficulty in their usage the starro's capacity to use five at once indicates a mastery of the fear element and its usage in battle, as shown when he personally went up against multiple iterations of titans all at once.\n\nThe humanoid \"Starro the Conqueror\" possesses telepathy strong enough to control the entire Starro alien race, and possesses immeasurable levels of physical resilience further bolstered by the energies drawn from the victims of his Starro probes. Being physically strong enough to behead the all but invulnerable Despero in single combat, Starro the Conqueror is all but impervious to physical harm much like his larger Starro clones; also akin to said spores the humanoid Starro can reproduce its own Starro clones from the mother Starro on his chest; a unique power of his own making is the ability to convert normal Earth-based starfish into Starro-based spores.\n\n\n\nStarro makes cameo appearances in \"\" (2008), \"\" (2010) and \"\" (2013).\n\n\nStarro was featured in Mattel's 2010 line at San Diego Comic-Con. The package (designed by Frank Varela) is a recreation of the original \"Brave and the Bold\" #28 cover and features a light and sound display (with Kevin Conroy). Each figure in the set has a recorded description by Conroy.\n\nStarro the Conqueror serves as the main antagonist of at Warner Bros. Movie World in Australia. A shooting dark ride, the Starro spores possessing people serve as targets for guests to fire upon.\n"}

Burlinson (born 1923, in Greenwich, Middlesex) and Angela Schofield (born 1926, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk), who had migrated to Canada after World War II. The family moved to New Jersey, United States, in 1958. In 1962 the family returned to Britain because of Antony's job. In 1965, the family moved again, this time to Australia. After six months his parents divorced and his mother and two younger sisters returned to Britain, leaving Burlinson with his father and his older sister, Susan.\n\nBurlinson's first public appearance as an actor was as Colonel Pickering in Mosman Primary School's production of \"My Fair Lady\". Moving to Bayview, he attended Pittwater High School on Sydney's Northern Beaches and was the school captain in his final year.\n\nBurlinson's father wanted him to become a lawyer, but because a friend was accepted into the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), he decided to audition and to his surprise he was accepted into the 1974 class, graduating in 1976. After working for the Queensland Theatre Company and Twelfth Night Theatre in Brisbane in 1977, he started appearing on Australian TV. By the beginning of 1979, he began playing Mickey Pratt in the teen-oriented Australian soap opera \"The Restless Years\", a role which lasted 16 months. In 1978, he appeared as Charlie in the Old Tote Theatre Company production of \"Da\" and as Jud Templeton in the play \"Tribute\" in 1979.

He also featured in the TV police drama \"Cop Shop\" in 1980/81 and in \"Skyways\".\n\nIn 1981, Burlinson had his career break when he was given the main role in the biggest Australian film production ever, which was to be shot the next year, \"The Man from Snowy River\", as Jim Craig (\"The Man\"). He had only a few short weeks to learn how to ride a horse and discovered he had somewhat of a natural ability and affinity with horses. \"Snowy River\" was filmed and released in Australia in 1982, quickly becoming the highest-grossing Australian film ever at that time, bringing Burlinson to stardom.\n\nIn his next film, Burlinson portrayed horse trainer Tommy Woodcock in \"Phar Lap: Heart of a Nation\". This film was another hit and confirmed Burlinson as a major star in the Australian film industry.\n\nIn 1985, Burlinson was cast by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven for a role in his first English-speaking film, the cult film \"Flesh and Blood\".\n\nIn 1986, Burlinson played the main role as yuppy windsurfer in the main modern day comedy romance \"Windrider\" alongside teen actress Nicole Kidman in her first adult role.

In 1988 he starred in the long-waited sequel to \"The Man from Snowy River II\", which has the United States' title of \"Return to Snowy River\" and the UK title of \"The Untamed\".\n\nFrom then onwards, Burlinson focused on historical productions, including the highly acclaimed 1988 LWT mini-series \"Piece of Cake\", set in England in 1939 and based on the 1983 novel of the same name by Derek Robinson and \"Showdown at Williams Creek\", set in pioneer North America.\n\nHe also does stage work, musicals and concerts as well as assisting charities.\n\nApart from his acting career, he is also a singer. A life-long love of the music of Frank Sinatra led Burlinson to compose an ode to the singer. He appeared on TV in 1990 on Ray Martin's \"Midday Show\" to nervously debut his singing voice to the Australian public with the song he had written, \"The Man In The Hat\".\nThe following year Tina Sinatra cast Burlinson as the voice of the young Sinatra in a miniseries she produced on her father's life, the Golden Globe Award-winning \"Sinatra\". With new doors now open to him, Burlinson auditioned for several musicals.\nBurlinson returned to the stage in \"How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying\" in 1992. He starred with some of Australia's most notable stage performers, Noel Ferrier, June Bronhill and Jackie Love. In 1996 he had stage roles with the Sydney Theatre Company, starring as Franklin in \"Merrily We Roll Along\" and as Ricky in \"Miracle City\".\n\nIn 1998, Burlinson created \"Frank – The Sinatra Story in Song\" which opened at the Seymour Centre in Sydney before going to other major cities. Sinatra himself died just two weeks before the opening night. From 1998 to 2003 Burlinson toured Australia regularly and also took the show to corporate events. In 2001 the show's name was changed to \"Frank – A Life in Song\". In 2002 he took the show to his native Toronto, Canada.\n\nBurlinson's versatility has also been featured in appearances on TV's \"Carols by Candlelight\" in 1999 and 2002. He had also had a role on the ABC doctor drama \"G.P.\" and hosted a season of the Nine Network TV show \"Animal Hospital\".\n\nBurlinson provided Sinatra's singing voice in the 2003 Australian movie \"The Night We Called It a Day\".\n\nBurlinson returned to the world of theatre in April 2004 in the lead role of Leo Bloom in Mel Brooks' musical \"The Producers\". He co-starred with Reg Livermore, Bert Newton and Chloe Dallimore.\n\nFor three years Burlinson was a judge on \"Australia's Got Talent\" alongside Red Symons and Dannii Minogue.\n\nIn 2010 he played a featured role in the movie \"The Cup\", directed by Simon Wincer, who had directed \"Phar Lap\".\n\nBurlinson has continued to produce and star in his own musical shows celebrating the music of Frank Sinatra and other vocal stars including \"Now We're Swinging!\" which toured around Australia.

Bobic is currently a member of the board (Vorstand) of Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nFredi Bobic was born in Maribor, SFR Yugoslavia, to a Slovene father and a Croatian mother. A few months after his birth his parents emigrated with him to Germany and settled down first in Ditzingen, then in Stuttgart. There, he started playing football at VfR Bad Cannstatt but soon switched to the youth team of VfB Stuttgart. While in Stuttgart, he also acquired German citizenship. Bobic reached his prime in the mid-1990s at VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga. In his first Bundesliga season (1994–95), he scored a goal in each of his first five games, so he became a candidate for the German national football team after only a few appearances in the first German league. In 1996, he was the Bundesliga's top scorer with 17 goals. At Stuttgart, he formed part of a successful attacking line-up, along with strike partner Giovane Élber and attacking midfielder Krasimir Balakov, known as the \"magic triangle\". After four years in Stuttgart, in 1999 he signed with Borussia Dortmund and was the club's top scorer in both 1999–2000 and 2000–01. However, after the signings of Jan Koller and Márcio Amoroso in the summer of 2001, he soon fell out of favor and played only three games in the first half of 2001–02 season. Subsequently, he was loaned to the Premier League side Bolton Wanderers, where he had a successful spell, playing a key role in keeping Bolton in the Premiership. His hat-trick in the 4–1 win against Ipswich at the Reebok Stadium ensured Bolton stayed up, and remained the last Bolton hat-trick in a competitive game until Joe Mason in the 2014–15 season. He scored once more for Bolton, in a 3–2 victory over Aston Villa. After returning from England he was signed by newly promoted Bundesliga side Hannover 96 where he reestablished himself as one of the league's top scorers, netting 14 times in 27 games. In 2003, he was signed by Hertha BSC, where he played for two seasons, scoring 8 goals in 54 games. He last played for Croatian outfit NK Rijeka before retiring in June 2006, at the end of the 2005–06 season.\n\nHe won 37 caps (10 goals) for Germany and was part of the UEFA Euro 1996 winning squad.

He was entrusted with tasks like caring for priceless works of art and the Elixir of Immortality, tasks in which he inevitably failed, usually in a destructive manner.\n\nFrom 1922 to 1926, the strip focused on Boob's pursuit of his true love Pearl, whom he finally married, then divorced, then married again and divorced again. Goldberg inserted supporting characters from his other strips, including \"Mike and Ike (They Look Alike)\" and \"Bertha the Siberian Cheesehound\". In 1934, he even brought in Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, inventor of those famed Rube Goldberg machines, for a brief sojourn before the strip was cancelled.\n\nThe strip had several Sunday toppers over the course of its run, including: \"Bertha the Siberian Cheesehound\" (Jan 10-July 4, 1926), \"Bill and Professor Butts\" (July 11, 1926 - Sept 23, 1934), \"Boob McNutt's Ark\" (Jan 8, 1933 - Feb 4, 1934), \"Are You Saving Jokers?\" (Feb 11-May 13, 1934) and \"Boob McNutt's Geography\" (May 20-Sept 23, 1934).\n\nIn his seminal 1923 essay, \"The Seven Lively Arts\", Gilbert Seldes called \"Boob McNutt\" \"the least worthy of Rube Goldberg's astonishing creations\". Boob was vindicated, however, when he was featured on the front cover of \"Nemo\" #24.\n\n"}

Since mid-November 2008, it has been owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which acquired it for about $16 million as a step in a process that might see a Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel completed.\n\nSince freight trains are not allowed in Amtrak's North River Tunnels, and the Poughkeepsie Bridge was closed in 1974, the ferry is the only freight crossing of the Hudson River south of the Alfred H. Smith Memorial Bridge, to the north of New York City, in a process known as the Selkirk hurdle.\nIt is the last remaining car float operation in the Port of New York and New Jersey.\n\nNYNJ leases approximately of land at Conrail's Greenville Yard in Greenville, Jersey City, where it connects with Class I railroads CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway, which jointly operate Conrail's North Jersey Shared Assets Area. On the Bay Ridge, Brooklyn end, the Bush Terminal Yard and the 65th Street Yard connect to the Long Island Rail Road's freight-only Bay Ridge Branch, which is operated by the New York and Atlantic Railway, and the New York City Transit Authority's South Brooklyn Railway. The 2.5 mile barge trip across the harbor takes approximately 45 minutes. The equivalent trip by truck is 35-50 miles.\n\nAs of 2012, the NYNJ system moves approximately 1,500 rail cars across the harbor per year. Port Authority officials suggested that the system can transport as many as 25,000 cars annually. NYNJ replaced two EMD GP38-2 with three low-emission locomotives from Knoxville Locomotive Works in Tennessee for $5 million. As of July 2015, the system had moved about 4900 rail cars year-to-date.\n\nFrom 1983 to 2006, the operation was known as the New York Cross Harbor Railroad . Earlier predecessors include the Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal Company, Bush Terminal Railroad, New York Dock Railway, and New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad operations at Bay Ridge and Greenville.\n\nIn 1999 the city of New York rehabilitated the larger 65th Street Yard for car float operations with two lift bridges. It was not turned over to NYCH because of a dispute over money owed the city. NYCH continued to use the single lift bridge at Bush Terminal instead. In 2002, New York Cross Harbor Railroad revenues from railroad operations were $1,685,899. It had 48 active customers, with shipments of cocoa from docks in Brooklyn as its largest line of business. It also operated a trucking service and offered shipside and dockside service for receipt or delivery of various types of cargo, such as oversized steel beams.\n\nNYCH ceased to exist in 2006; a new company, Mid-Atlantic New England Rail, LLC of West Seneca, New York, bought the railroad and renamed it New York New Jersey Rail, LLC (NYNJ). The city of New York purchased the company two years later.\n\nThe Port Authority began working with government agencies in New York and New Jersey to bring NYNJ to a state of good repair. This includes emergency work to stabilize the transfer bridge structure in Greenville, repairs to the float bridge and track infrastructure in Brooklyn, and procurement of ultra-low emissions locomotives and a new 30-car rail barge. In May 2010 the Port Authority announced that it would purchase Greenville Yard and build a new barge-to-rail facility there, as well as improving the existing rail car float system. The barge-to-rail facility is expected to handle an estimated 60,000 to 90,000 containers of solid waste per year from New York City, eliminating up to 360,000 trash truck trips a year. The authority's board authorized $118.1 million for the overall project.\n\nIn November 2011 the Port Authority hired HDR, Inc. of Omaha, Nebraska to rehabilitate Greenville Yard. Work included rehabilitating the railyard and waterfront structures, including a rail barge and transfer bridge, demolishing two other bridges, designing a new barge and two new bridges, and adding 10,000 feet of track. In July 2012 NYNJ began operating out of the 65th Street Yard. Initial cargo included apples, home heating oil, new automobiles, and scrap metal. The railroad north along First Avenue was refurbished and new tracks laid to support operations at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, including an automobile import pier and a new municipal recycling plant.\n\nOn October 29, 2012 Hurricane Sandy caused major damage to the Greenville facility, undermining the float bridge gantries and sinking one of the car floats. The 81-year-old gantry structures were ultimately demolished. The working float bridge at Bush Terminal was transferred by barge to Greenville, where it was re-designated the Greenville Pontoon Bridge. Service was restored in late December, after 52 days of intensive reconstruction.\n\nOn September 17, 2014 the Port Authority announced that it was funding a major redevelopment of the Greenville Yard, to include a new ExpressRail container terminal servicing the Port Jersey Global Marine Terminal. The Port Authority would also build two new rail-to-barge transfer bridges, purchase two new car float barges, and buy four new ultra low emission locomotives In November 2017, the first of the new barges, \"NYNJR100,\" was delivered to NYNJ. Built by Metal Trades, Inc., the four-track barge can carry up to 18 rail cars of length, with up to 2,298 long tons (2,335 tonne) of cargo. The second barge, \"NYNJR200,\" was delivered in December 2018. An older, 14-car barge, the \"278,\" is still in service. The new ExpressRail container terminal opened January 7, 2019, with four tracks out of eight operational. The remaining four tracks were opened on June 17, 2019.\n\nIn July 2017, the Port Authority announced a $35 million study to build a Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, suitable for freight. If built, the tunnel would eliminate the need for the NYNJ ferry.\n\n\n"}

Known for their rambunctious live shows, technically proficient horn solos and tight arrangements, the Scofflaws were one of the top third wave ska acts of the '90s and one of the most beloved bands on the now-defunct Moon Ska label, as well as the center and focal point of the once-thriving Long Island ska scene.\n\nThe band originally performed as the New Bohemians, initially with a stronger emphasis on novelty '60s, R&B and TV-show theme cover songs, bolstered by original ska-oriented anthems such as \"Rudy's Back\" and \"Paul Getty\". In 1988, they sold the New Bohemians name to Geffen Records (who had just signed Edie Brickell & New Bohemians), and regrouped as the Scofflaws.\n\nThe Scofflaws early sound was characterized by strong R&B and jazz influences as well as eclectic covers of such songs as Henry Mancini's \"A Shot in the Dark\", Danny Elfman's theme for \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\", Sergio Leone's \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" theme and the Skatalites instrumental \"Ska-La Parisian\". Original songs like \"Ska-La-Carte\", \"Nude Beach\" and \"William Shatner\" became cult favorites due to the offbeat lyrics and quirky vocal stylings of bandleader Richard \"Sammy\" Brooks and trombonist Buford O'Sullivan.\n\nTheir self-titled debut studio album was released in 1991 by Moon Records, followed by \"Ska in Hi Fi\" in 1995, the concert recording \"Live! Vol. 1\" in 1996, and their third studio album, \"Record of Convictions\", in 1998. \n\nThey toured the United States several times, including stints as the openers for Desmond Dekker and Bad Manners. In addition, they toured Europe in 1998 supporting Laurel Aitken.\n\nThe band's lineup saw frequent changes and served as a springboard for numerous New York ska musicians, as well as sprouting several spinoff groups. Original co-frontman Mike Drance left in 1994 to form the Bluebeats, while bassist Victor Rice went on to be a founding member of the New York Ska-Jazz Ensemble and continue a career in music production. Several Scofflaws members including O'Sullivan, Paul Gebhardt and Tony Calarco also played for fellow Moon Ska artists the Toasters as well as One Groovy Coconut and Royal Roost, and the Scofflaws have often shared members with fellow Huntington band Spider Nick & the Maddogs (whose leader, \"Spider Nick\" Martielli, composed Scofflaws favorite \"Spider on My Bed\").\n\nAlthough the Scofflaws have not released a studio recording since 1998, Brooks continues to lead the band in live performances within the New York area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2194799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194799", "title": "Zabriskie Point (film)", "text": "Zabriskie Point (film)\n\nZabriskie Point is a 1970 American drama film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni and starring Mark Frechette, Daria Halprin, and Rod Taylor. It was widely noted at the time for its setting in the counterculture of the United States. Some of the film's scenes were shot on location at Zabriskie Point in Death Valley. The film was an overwhelming commercial failure, and was panned by most critics upon release. Its critical standing has increased, however, since its release. It has to some extent achieved cult status and is noted for its cinematography, use of music, and direction.\n\nIn a room at a university campus in 1970, white and black students argue about an impending student strike. Mark (Mark Frechette) leaves the meeting after saying he is \"willing to die, but not of boredom\" for the cause, which draws criticism from the young white radicals. Following a mass arrest at the campus protest, Mark visits a police station hoping to bail his roommate out of jail. He is told to wait but goes to the lock-up area, asks further about bail for his roommate, is rebuffed, calls out to the arrested students and faculty and is arrested. He gives his name as Karl Marx, which a duty officer types as \"Carl Marx\". After he is released from jail, Mark and another friend buy firearms from a Los Angeles gun shop, saying they need them for \"self-defense\" to \"protect our women.\"\n\nIn a downtown Los Angeles office building, successful real estate executive Lee Allen (Rod Taylor) reviews a television commercial for Sunny Dunes, a new resort-like real estate development in the desert. Instead of actors or models, the slickly produced commercial features casually dressed, smiling mannequins. In the next scene Allen talks with his associate (G.D. Spradlin) about the greater Los Angeles area's very rapid growth as the two drive through crowded streets.\n\nMark goes to a bloody campus confrontation between students and police. Some students are tear-gassed and at least one is shot. As Mark reaches for a gun in his boot, a Los Angeles policeman is seen being fatally shot, although it is unclear by whom. Mark flees the campus and rides a city bus to suburban Hawthorne, California where, after failing to buy a sandwich on credit from a local blue-collar delicatessen, he walks to Hawthorne Municipal Airport, steals a small Cessna 210 aircraft and flies into the desert.\n\nMeanwhile, Daria (Daria Halprin), \"a sweet, pot-smoking post-teenybopper of decent inclinations\", is driving across the desert towards Phoenix in a 1950s-era Buick automobile to meet her boss Lee, who may or may not also be her lover. Along the way Daria is searching for a man who works with \"emotionally disturbed\" children from Los Angeles. She finds the young boys near a roadhouse in the Mojave desert but they tease, taunt, and grab at her, boldly asking for \"a piece of ass\", to which she asks in reply, \"Are you sure you'd know what to do with it?\"\n\nDaria flees in her car. While filling its radiator with water, she is spied from the air by Mark, who buzzes her car and then flies only 15 feet over her as she lies face down in the sand. He throws a T-shirt out of the window of the aircraft for her to pick up. Daria goes from upset to curious and smiling during this sequence.\n\nThey later meet at the desert shack of an old man, where Mark asks her for a lift so he can buy gasoline for the aircraft. The two then wander to Zabriskie Point, where they make love and the site's geological formations seem to come alive in a dusty orgy.\n\nLater, a California highway patrolman suspiciously questions Daria. Hidden behind a portable toilet meant for tourists, Mark takes aim at the policeman but Daria stands between the two of them to block this, apparently saving the policeman's life before he drives away. Daria asks Mark if he was the one who killed the cop in Los Angeles. He states that he wanted to, but someone else shot the officer first and that he \"never got off a shot\".\n\nReturning to the stolen aircraft, they paint it with politically-charged slogans and psychedelic colors. Daria pleads with Mark to travel with her and leave the aircraft but Mark is intent on returning and taking the risks that it involves. He flies back to Los Angeles and lands the plane at the airport in Hawthorne. The police (along with some radio and television reporters) are waiting for him, and patrol cars chase the aircraft down the runway. Instead of stopping, Mark tries to turn the taxiing aircraft around across the grass and is shot to death by one of the policemen.\n\nDaria learns about Mark's death on the car radio. She drives to Lee's lavish desert home, \"a desert Berchtesgaden\" set high on a rock outcropping near Phoenix, Arizona, where she sees three affluent women sunning themselves and chatting by the swimming pool. She grieves for Mark by drenching herself in the house's architectural waterfall. Lee is deeply immersed in a business meeting having to do with the complex and financially risky Sunny Dunes development. Taking a break, he spots Daria in the house and happily greets her. She goes downstairs alone and finds the guest room that has been set aside for her but after briefly opening the door, she shuts it again.\n\nSeeing a young Native American housekeeper in the hallway, Daria leaves silently. She drives off but stops to get out of the car and look back at the house, her own imagination seeing it repeatedly blown apart in billows of orange flame and household items.\n\n\nCast notes\n\nWhile in the United States for the 1966 premiere of his film \"Blowup\", which had been a surprising box-office hit, Antonioni saw a short newspaper article about a young man who had stolen an aircraft and was killed when he tried to return it in Phoenix, Arizona. Antonioni took this as a thread, with which he could tie together the plot of his next film. After writing many drafts, he hired playwright Sam Shepard to write the script. Shepard, Antonioni, Italian filmmaker Franco Rossetti, Antonioni's frequent collaborator screenwriter Tonino Guerra and Clare Peploe (later to become the wife of Bernardo Bertolucci), worked on the screenplay.\n\nMost of the supporting roles were played by a professional cast, including, notably, Rod Taylor, along with G.D. Spradlin, in one of his early feature film roles, following many appearances on U.S. national television. Paul Fix, a friend and acting coach of John Wayne who had appeared in many of Wayne's films, played the owner of a roadhouse in the Mojave desert. Kathleen Cleaver, a member of the Black Panthers and wife of Eldridge Cleaver, appeared in the documentary-like student meeting scene at the opening of the film.\n\nShooting began in July 1968 in Los Angeles, much of it on location in the wider southern downtown area. Exteriors of the art deco Richfield Tower were shown in a few scenes shot shortly before its demolition in November of that year. Various college campus scenes, excluding the scene of the student meeting, were filmed on location at Contra Costa Community College in San Pablo, California. The production then moved to location shooting at Carefree, Arizona, near Phoenix and from there to Death Valley. The production rented a Carefree mansion and built a replica of the mansion on the lot of Southwestern Studio in Carefree, Arizona, for the special effect of blowing up the mansion. Location shooting also took place in the Mojave Desert.\n\nEarly film industry publicity reports claimed Antonioni would gather 10,000 extras in the desert for the filming of the lovemaking scene but this never happened. The scene was filmed with dust-covered and highly choreographed actors from The Open Theatre. The United States Department of Justice investigated whether this violated the Mann Act – which forbade the taking of women across state lines for sexual purposes – however, no sex was filmed and no state lines were crossed, given that Death Valley is in California. State officials in Sacramento were also ready to charge Antonioni with \"immoral conduct, prostitution or debauchery\" if he staged an actual orgy. FBI officials investigated the film because of Antonioni's political views, and officials in Oakland, California accused the director of staging a real riot for a scene early in the film.\n\nDuring filming, Antonioni was quoted as criticizing the U.S. film industry for financially wasteful production practices, which he found \"almost immoral\" compared to the more thrifty approach of Italian studios.\n\nThe soundtrack to \"Zabriskie Point\" included music from Pink Floyd, The Youngbloods, Kaleidoscope, Jerry Garcia, Patti Page, Grateful Dead, the Rolling Stones, and John Fahey. Roy Orbison wrote and sang the theme song, over the credits, called \"So Young (Love Theme From \"Zabriskie Point\")\".\n\nRichard Wright of Pink Floyd wrote a tune called \"The Violent Sequence\" for inclusion in the film. Antonioni rejected the song because it was too subdued and instead synchronized a re-recording of the band's \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\", retitled \"Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up\", with the film's violent ending scene. Roger Waters states in \"Classic Albums - Pink Floyd - Making The Dark Side Of The Moon\" that while he loved the song, Antonioni said it was \"too sad\" and that it reminded him of church. Eventually it was reworked into a new song known as \"Us and Them\", which was released on their album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" in 1973. \"The Violent Sequence\" remained unreleased until it was included on a 2011 boxed set of \"Dark Side of the Moon\", where it was named \"Us and them (Richard Wright Demo)\".\n\nOther discarded pieces recorded for the film, by Pink Floyd, were released on a bonus disc with the 1997 CD re-release of the soundtrack album, along with pieces by Jerry Garcia.\n\nJohn Fahey was flown to Rome to record some music for the film, but that was not used. The accounts of Fahey and others differ. However, a portion of his \"Dance of Death\" was used in the film. Antonioni visited the band The Doors while they were recording their album \"L.A. Woman\" and thought about putting them in the soundtrack. The Doors recorded the song \"L'America\" for \"Zabriskie Point\", but it was not used.\n\nMark Frechette was living at Mel Lyman's intentional community at Fort Hill, Boston, Massachusetts at the time he made this film. He and Lyman hoped that the soundtrack would include some of the Americana type music Lyman had recorded with Jim Kweskin and the Jug Band. Frechette left copies of Lyman's newspaper \"Avatar\" around the studio and took time to play tapes of the band for the director and explain Lyman's work. When Antonioni seemed oblivious to the perceived importance of Lyman's music, Frechette quit the film, but returned six days later.\n\nFollowing prolonged publicity and controversy in North America throughout its production, \"Zabriskie Point\" was released in February 1970, almost four years after Antonioni began pre-production and over a year and a half after shooting began. The film was panned by most critics and other published commentators of all political stripes, as were the performances of Frechette and Halprin. \"The New York Times\" reviewer Vincent Canby called \"Zabriskie Point\" \"a noble artistic impulse short-circuited in a foreign land.\" Roger Ebert echoed Canby, writing: \"The director who made Monica Vitti seem so incredibly alone is incapable, in \"Zabriskie Point,\" of making his young characters seem even slightly together. Their voices are empty; they have no resonance as human beings. They don't play to each other, but to vague narcissistic conceptions of themselves. They wouldn't even meet were it not for a preposterous Hollywood coincidence.\"\n\nThe counterculture audience MGM hoped to draw largely ignored the film during its brief theatrical run and taken altogether the outcome was a notorious box-office bomb. Production expenses were at least $7 million and only $900,000 was made in the domestic release. The film was listed in the 1978 book \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\". It has been described as \"the worst film ever made by a director of genius\" but it \"is still absolutely watchable because of the magic of Antonioni's eye\". Over 20 years after the film's release, \"Rolling Stone\" editor David Fricke wrote that \"\"Zabriskie Point\" was one of the most extraordinary disasters in modern cinematic history.\" It was the only film Antonioni directed in the United States, where in 1994 he was given the Honorary Academy Award \"in recognition of his place as one of the cinema's master visual stylists.\"\n\nWith early 21st-century screenings of pristine wide-screen prints and a later DVD release, \"Zabriskie Point\" at last garnered some critical praise, mostly for the stark beauty of its cinematography and innovative use of music in the soundtrack, but opinions about the film were still mixed. Director Stéphane Sednaoui referenced the film in his video for \"Today\" by The Smashing Pumpkins, where an ice-cream salesman steals his employer's ice-cream van, escapes to the desert, and colourfully paints the van while couples kiss in the desert. In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the \"Chicago Reader\" included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100.\n\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

Its common name comes from Daniel Giraud Elliot, who first described the species in 1899.\n\nElliot's short-tailed shrew is similar in appearance to the closely related southern short-tailed shrew, although slightly larger on average, and was long thought to belong to the same species. It is a heavily built shrew with short legs and tail, and a long, pointed snout with long whiskers. The ears and eyes are both small, the eyelids being permanently closed in some individuals, a feature otherwise unknown among shrews.\n\nThe fur is velvety in texture, and uniformly colored greyish to brown. Adults range from in total length, including the tail, and weigh .\n\nElliot's short-tailed shrew is found in lowland environments with heavy vegetation from southern Iowa and Nebraska in the north to parts of Texas and northern Louisiana in the south, including much of the states of Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, and the northeastern corner of Colorado. Two subspecies are currently recognised:\n\n\nThe species inhabits a diverse range of habitats, including grasslands, agricultural land, and woodland. Although it generally prefers well watered environments with plenty of ground litter, it is also known from relatively dry and sandy terrain in Texas and Colorado, often with minimal ground cover.\n\nLike other shrews, this species is insectivorous, its diet consisting primarily of beetles and slugs, along with other insects, spiders, and earthworms. They may also eat a small quantity of plants and fungi, and have been reported to eat North American deermice on occasion. Predators include owls, hawks, snakes, and swift foxes.\n\nElliot's short-tailed shrew is generally a solitary, nocturnal animal, spending the day sleeping in burrows in soft soil or leaf litter. The burrows may contain nests made from grass or leaves, and are surrounded by a network of trackways that the shrew uses while hunting for prey. They have been reported to travel across home ranges of anything from , and to travel mostly around dawn and sunset. Having poor eyesight, they hunt primarily by means of echolocation. They are active throughout the year, and do not hibernate.\n\nThe shrew breeds from early spring to late summer, and may be able to raise two or three litters per in a year. Gestation lasts 21 or 22 days, and results in the birth of four to seven hairless young. The young are weaned, with a full coat of fuzzy hair, by one month of age, not receiving the adult coat until they have reached adult size. Individuals can live for up to two years.\n\nElliot's short-tailed shrew was originally described as a subspecies of \"Blarina brevicauda\", and was only identified as a separate species in 1981. Genetic analysis to determine its precise relationship to other members of the genus has been ambiguous, with some studies placing it as the closest relative to the southern short-tailed shrew, and others showing it as being basal to the other species.

The town was built on coal and oil shale mining, and the paper industries.\n\nLoanhead was a tiny village by about 1599, when it was included on a map of the Lothians. It was granted a charter allowing a weekly market and annual fair in 1669. Coal was mined profitably in the area for Sir John Clerk of Penicuik by 1685. The Springfield paper mill, in the valley of the River North Esk to the south of the town, commenced in 1742, while Polton mill followed in 1750. By 1754 Loanhead was a medium-sized settlement.\n\nThe limestone industry was a source of employment by the late eighteenth century, the works being at Burdiehouse, about a mile to the northwest. The coal industry continued to expand and by 1874 the town was linked to the railway. Shale was mined between Loanhead and Burdiehouse in the late nineteenth century, from 1880 under the Clippens Oil Company of Paisley. By this time the population had expanded to 3,250. The town was granted burgh status in 1884. The North British Railway built a steel lattice girder box viaduct across Bilston Glen in 1892, replacing another which had been designed by Thomas Bouch.\n\nThe shale mines closed in 1909 because of incoming water from the Edinburgh waterworks aqueducts. Burdiehouse limeworks ceased in 1912, although limestone was mined in the area until 1960. The Polton paper mill closed in 1955.\n\nCoal mining continued, with the large Bilston Glen pit being sunk between 1952 and 1961. It was closed in 1989, and the site cleared. Bilston Glen Colliery at one stage produced 1,000,000 tons of coal per annum, and employed 2,300 men. The coal workings stretched from Rosewell to Dalkeith. All coal working ceased following the violent strikes of 1984-1985, when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister. The site is now used as an industrial estate.\n\nLoanhead is administered by Midlothian Council, and following recent boundary changes lies in the new ward of Midlothian West, served by three Midlothian Councillors. At a local level, the Community Council provides a forum at which local views can be aired.\n\nStraiton Retail Park includes one of only two IKEA stores in Scotland. Proposals have been made for Straiton to be further developed with new facilities including an 8,000 capacity events arena serving Edinburgh. 2 hotels are included in the proposals.\n\nThe main street, Clerk Street, is busy with traffic and local shoppers. Large stores such as Sainsbury's and Costco are in proximity.\n\nA large, modern industrial estate with around 100 different concerns provides a wide range of jobs for local residents. Businesses include MacSweens haggis factory, and Police Scotland's Communications Centre (The Force Communications Centre, or FCC) where all radio traffic and emergency calls are handled. The Pentlands industrial estate was opened in the 1970s, and a number of retail and other businesses trade from the periphery of the town. These were from the likes of Gregg's to the more industrial companies focusing on welding and steel fabrication.\n\nLoanhead has an annual gala day, also known as \"Children's Day\". A book to commemorate the 100th Anniversary was published in 2003. Since 2001, an annual weekend music festival, Loanhead Music Festival, has been staged. This increasingly popular event attracts a wide range of mainly acoustic musicians to the town each June, and features around eight venues. As an offshoot from the Festival, Loanhead Guitar Club meets on Wednesday evenings to provide informal tuition and practice opportunities in guitar and other instruments for over 18's.\n\nThe Loanhead Miners Club continues to be a major social and community hub for the town, and wide variety of events are run from there. Loanhead Guitar Club meets on Wednesday evenings to provide informal tuition and practice opportunities for over 18's.\n\nSeveral community groups run a variety of clubs including five a side football and Girl Guides.\n\nLoanhead has a small but well used and appointed leisure centre anda small library.\n\nA small green square in the centre of the town features a memorial to miners killed in the town's coal mines, and large and popular bronze sculpture known as the Coghorn, by Andrew Burton. A small cat originally featured on the tip of the horn, but this was removed by vandals, and is yet to be replaced. A local Palladian mansion, Mavisbank House, built in 1723 but derelict for many years, featured on the BBC television series \"Restoration\" in 2004.\n\nThe town has three primary schools - Paradykes, St. Margaret's (Catholic) and Loanhead Primary. A new joint campus for St. Margaret's and Loanhead Primary was completed and opened in March 2008. The two schools are on the same site but separate allowing the separation of Roman Catholic and secular education but children are able to mix in a range of activities.\n\nLoanhead has a health centre.\n\nA new park and ride facility, provides bus service into Edinburgh City Centre, opened in 2009. Loanhead is under a mile from the A720 city by-pass.\n\nThe town is twinned with Harnes in northern France, which also has a strong mining tradition. The town was formerly twinned with Dalum in Denmark, just south of Odense, on the island of Funen. In the 1960s, several exchange visits between the two towns took place, but the twinning formally ceased as a consequence of Dalum being absorbed by the much larger Odense.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2194814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194814", "title": "John S. Marmaduke", "text": "John S. Marmaduke\n\nJohn S. Marmaduke (born John Sappington Marmaduke, March 14, 1833 – December 28, 1887) served as the 25th governor of Missouri from 1885 until his death in 1887. \n\nDuring the American Civil War, he was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded cavalry in the Trans-Mississippi Theater. On September 6, 1863 Marmaduke killed Confederate Brigadier-General Lucius M. Walker in a duel. Major-General Sterling Price ordered Marmaduke's arrest, but suspended the order because of the impending Union advance on Little Rock, Arkansas. Marmaduke never faced a court martial for the duel.\n\nThe second son among ten children, John S. Marmaduke was born on his father's plantation in Saline County, Missouri. His father, Meredith M. Marmaduke (1791–1864), served as the 8th governor of Missouri, succeeding to office after the suicide of his predecessor. The family was quite political, and Marmaduke's great-grandfather, John Breathitt, had served as the governor of Kentucky from 1832 to 1834, dying in office. \n\nMarmaduke attended Chapel Hill Academy in Lafayette County, Missouri and Masonic College in Lexington, Missouri, before attending Yale University for two years and then Harvard University for another year. U.S. Representative John S. Phelps appointed Marmaduke to the United States Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1857, placing 30th out of 38 students. He served as a second lieutenant in the 1st United States Mounted Riflemen, before being transferred to the 2d United States Cavalry under Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston. Marmaduke later served in the Utah War and was posted to Camp Floyd, Utah, in 1858–1860.\n\nMarmaduke was on duty in the New Mexico Territory in the spring of 1861 when he received news that Missouri had seceded from the Union. He returned home to meet with his father, a strong Unionist. Afterwards, Marmaduke decided to resign from the United States Army, effective April 1861. Pro-secession Missouri Governor Claiborne F. Jackson, Marmaduke's uncle, soon appointed him as the colonel of the 1st Regiment of Rifles, a unit from Saline County, Missouri, in the Missouri State Guard. \n\nGovernor Jackson departed Jefferson City, Missouri in June, along with State Guard commander Major-General Sterling Price, to recruit more troops. Marmaduke and his regiment met them at Boonville, Missouri. Within a short time, Price and Jackson left, leaving Marmaduke in charge of a small force of militia. Marmaduke realized his troops were not adequately prepared for combat, but Governor Jackson ordered him to make a stand against Union forces who had entered the state. Federal Brigadier-General Nathaniel Lyon's 1,700 well-trained and equipped soldiers easily routed Marmaduke's untrained and poorly armed force at the Battle of Boonville on June 17, 1861. The skirmish was mockingly dubbed \"the Boonville Races\" by Unionists, since Marmaduke's recruits broke and ran after 20 minutes of battle.\n\nDisgusted by the situation, Marmaduke resigned his commission in the Missouri State Guard and traveled to Richmond, Virginia, where he was commissioned a first lieutenant in the regular Confederate States Army. The Confederate War Department ordered him to report for duty in Arkansas, where he soon was elected lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Arkansas Battalion. He served on the staff of Lieutenant-General William J. Hardee, a former United States Military Academy instructor of infantry tactics. Marmaduke's former Mormon War commander, Albert Sidney Johnston, asked him to join his staff in early 1862. Marmaduke was wounded in action at the Battle of Shiloh as colonel of the 3rd Confederate Regiment, incapacitating him for several months.\n\nIn November 1862, the War Department confirmed Marmaduke's promotion to brigadier-general. His first battle as a brigade commander was at the Battle of Prairie Grove. In April 1863, Marmaduke departed Arkansas with 5,000 men and ten artillery pieces and entered Union-held Missouri. However, he was repulsed at the Battle of Cape Girardeau and forced to return to Helena, Arkansas. Controversy soon followed. In September 1863, he accused his immediate superior officer, Brigadier-General Lucius M. Walker, of cowardice in action for not being present with his men on the battlefield. Walker, slighted by the insult, challenged Marmaduke to a duel, which resulted in Walker's death on September 6, 1863.\n\nMarmaduke later commanded a cavalry division in the Trans-Mississippi Department, serving in the Red River Campaign. During this period, he once again was involved in controversy. Commanding a mixed force of Confederate troops, including Native-American soldiers of the 1st and 2nd Choctaw Regiments, Marmaduke defeated a Union foraging detachment at the Battle of Poison Spring, Arkansas on April 18, 1864. Marmaduke's men were accused of murdering African-American soldiers of the 1st Kansas Colored Volunteer Infantry (later designated the 79th U.S. Colored Infantry). Marmaduke and other white officers claimed that the accusations of illegal killings were overblown, and blamed any murders that may have happened on the Choctaw troops who, in the words of one Confederate, did \"kill and scalp some\" of the black troops. He was hailed in the Confederate press for what was publicized as a significant southern victory.\n\nMarmaduke commanded a division in Major-General Sterling Price's Raid September–October 1864 into Missouri, where Marmaduke was captured at the Battle of Mine Creek in Kansas (by Private James Dunlavy of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry). While still a prisoner of war at Johnson's Island in Ohio, Marmaduke was promoted to major-general in March 1865. He was released after the war ended. His younger brother, Henry Hungerford Marmaduke, served in the Confederate States Navy, was captured and was imprisoned on Johnson's Island. He later served the federal government in negotiations with South American nations. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Two other Marmaduke brothers died in the American Civil War.\n\nMarmaduke returned home to Missouri and settled in Carondelet, St. Louis. He worked briefly for an insurance company, whose ethics he found contrary to his own. He then edited an agricultural journal, and publicly accused the railroads of discriminatory pricing against local farmers. The governor soon appointed Marmaduke to the state's first Rail Commission. Marmaduke decided to enter politics, but lost the 1880 Democratic nomination for governor to former Union general Thomas T. Crittenden, who had strong support and financial backing from the railroads. Undeterred, Marmaduke ran again for governor four years later, at a time when public opinion had changed, and railroad reform and regulation became more in vogue. Marmaduke conducted a campaign which apologetically highlighted his Confederate service, emphasized alleged abuses of Missourians by Union troops during the Civil War, celebrated the activities of pro-Confederate \"partisan guerrillas\" such as William Clarke Quantrill, claimed that the Republican Party in Missouri was a tool of \"carpetbaggers\" to oppress \"native\" Missourians, and made overt appeals to white racism. He was elected on a platform officially focused on cooperation between former Unionists and Confederates, promising an agenda which would produce a \"New Missouri.\" He settled potentially crippling railroad strikes in 1885 and 1886. The following year, Marmaduke pushed laws through the state legislature that finally began regulating the state's railway industry. He also dramatically boosted the state's funding of public schools, with nearly a third of the annual budget allocated to education.\n\nMarmaduke never married, and his two nieces served as hostesses at the governor's mansion. Like his great-grandfather, he died while serving as governor. He contracted pneumonia late in 1887 and died in Jefferson City, Missouri, where he was buried in Woodland Cemetery.\n\nMarmaduke, Arkansas, is named after him.\n\n\n"}

Gordon later died of the infection caused by the wound. McCulloch was found guilty and sentenced to death. Although he initially escaped to France, he was captured when he returned to Edinburgh in 1697 and beheaded at the Mercat Cross. McCulloch had been living in Scotland since 1694 under the alias \"Mr. Johnstoune\". He was the last man to be executed on the Maiden. Following his death, much of his family emigrated to America, and Cardoness Castle, which had been owned by the family since c. 1470, was abandoned. \n\nThere is also a legend (quoted by Sir Walter Scott, a distant relation) that McCulloch was in fact saved from execution by a gnome whom he had done a favour for earlier in life, and that he was never seen again. Another story tells that after his beheading, his headless body ran 100 yards down the Royal Mile.

Among the composers she grew familiar with were Square employees Hitoshi Sakimoto, Nobuo Uematsu and Kenji Ito. Her favorite classical composers at the time were Piotr Paleczny and Hiromi Uehara. Tanioka attended Kobe University, where she studied music and joined a choir. She graduated with a degree in musical performance. Although she had planned on performing music as a career, during college she became more interested in composing than performance, and in video game composition because of her childhood experiences. After graduating, she joined Square (now Square Enix) as a composer in 1998.\n\nHer first score was the soundtrack to 1998's \"The Fallen Angels\", by developer Steel Hearts, which she composed with Masaki Izutani. That same year, she joined Square and composed her first soundtrack for them to a game in the \"Chocobo\" series, \"Chocobo's Dungeon 2\", with Yasuhiro Kawakami, Tsuyoshi Sekito and Kenji Ito. Her second work in the series was also her first solo soundtrack, that of \"Dice de Chocobo\", a video game adaption of a board game. She composed for two other projects over the next two years, \"All Star Pro-Wrestling\" with Tsuyoshi Sekito and Kenichiro Fukui and \"Blue Wing Blitz\" by herself. Her first major composing role was in 2002, when she was one of three composers chosen to write the soundtrack to \"Final Fantasy XI\". Although she did not contribute more than one song to the multiple expansions to the game, during this period she joined \"The Star Onions\", a band made of Square Enix composers that arranges and performs \"Final Fantasy XI\" music. The group has released two albums to date.\n\nAfter \"Final Fantasy XI\", Tanioka returned to the \"Chocobo\" series to arrange her \"Dice de Chocobo\" soundtrack for the game's remake, \"\". After that, however, she composed the soundtrack to \"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles\", which led to her composing the soundtracks to the other five games in the series. Between the games, she worked on the soundtracks to \"Code Age Commanders\", \"Code Age Brawls\", \"Project Sylpheed\", and \"\". On February 28, 2010 Tanioka announced her departure from Square Enix, following several other Square Enix composers such as Kenichiro Fukui, Junya Nakano, and Masashi Hamauzu; she joined the composer's group GE-ON-DAN with many other composers like Nakano. In 2011, she became one of the founding members of Ringmasters, a non-exclusive worldwide group of artists and composers, though she later left the group. She composed in 2011 music for iOS interactive storybooks, \"Snow White\", \"The Ugly Duckling\", and \"Hansel and Gretel\", before founding her own independent company, Riquismo, in August 2012. Riquismo is not a full studio, and Tanioka continues to work independently. Tanioka has said that she decided to become a freelance composer because she wanted to write for a wider variety of subjects. Since its founding she has composed music for \"Ragnarok Odyssey\", for which she wrote independently of any prior music from the \"Ragnarok\" series, and \"MA.YU.MO.RI\".\n\nUnlike the soundtracks to the numbered \"Final Fantasy\" games, no songs from the \"Crystal Chronicles\" or \"Chocobo\" soundtracks have appeared in any compilation albums produced by Square Enix. Songs from the two series have also not appeared in any of the official \"Final Fantasy\" music concerts, although \"Morning Sky\" from the \"Crystal Chronicles\" soundtrack was played in the first Games in Concert performance in Utrecht, Netherlands on November 26, 2006. It was performed by Floor Jansen of the band After Forever and the Metropole Orchestra.\n\nKumi Tanioka's signature style, especially for the \"Crystal Chronicles\" games, is that of \"world music\". She has described the musical style for the soundtrack to \"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles\" as being based on \"ancient instruments\". The soundtrack has extensive use of many medieval and renaissance musical instruments like the recorder, the crumhorn and the lute, creating a distinctively rustic feel, and also follows the practices and styles of medieval music. She says the idea came to her while looking at illustrations of the game world, which gave her the idea of making \"world music\", where the tracks would \"not [be] limited to a single country or culture\". She feels that specific instruments do not necessarily need to be tied to a specific geographic region, and tries to see, for example, how an Indian instrument and a Celtic instrument might work with each other.\n\nFor the soundtrack to \"Ring of Fates\", Tanioka tried to focus on \"creating a new landscape containing the same atmosphere\". She returned to using instruments in an \"ethnic manner\" again in composing the soundtrack for \"Echoes of Time\". The piano performances in the \"Ring of Fates\" soundtrack were done by Kumi Tanioka. She did the performances herself rather than use an outside performer as most \"Final Fantasy\" soundtracks have done primarily because she \"likes to play piano\", and they were done without any sheet music, as she preferred instead to improvise. She took extensive piano lessons as a child, and lists piano and choral music as the biggest influences on her musical style. She also claims to have been influenced by music from a wide variety of cultures, like Indonesian, Irish and Balinese music. Tanioka has performed live at several events, including 2011's \"Final Fantasy XI\"-themed VanaCon; she likes to do live performances as she feels it connects her with the listener's response to her music, unlike when composing where she can only imagine audience's responses to hearing her music.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known as the former manager of the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2007 to 2019. During his playing career, Bochy was a catcher for the Houston Astros, New York Mets, and San Diego Padres. Prior to becoming the Giants' manager, he was the Padres' manager for 12 seasons. Bochy led the Giants to three World Series Championships, and previously led the Padres to one World Series appearance. Bochy was the 11th manager in MLB history to achieve 2,000 wins.\n\nBochy is the only former Padres player to serve as the team's manager on a non-interim basis. He participated in all five postseason appearances in Padres history, as a backup catcher in and as their manager in , , , and . In 1998, he led the Padres to their first National League (NL) pennant in 14 years; however, they lost the 1998 World Series to the New York Yankees.\n\nBochy reached the World Series for a second time as the manager of the 2010 Giants, this time in a winning effort over the Texas Rangers, and brought the first ever World Series Championship home to the city of San Francisco; it was the first for the Giants franchise since 1954. Two years later, in the 2012 World Series, by sweeping the Detroit Tigers, Bochy managed the Giants to their second World Series Championship win in three years. He reached the World Series for a fourth time, in 2014, and managed his third World Championship in five years, this time leading the Giants over the Kansas City Royals in seven games.\n\nBochy was both the first foreign-born manager to reach the World Series (1998) and the first European-born manager to win the World Series (). On July 23, 2013, he became the 21st manager with 1500 wins. On April 10, 2017, Bochy surpassed Dusty Baker to become the Giants all-time managerial wins leader in the San Francisco Era. On February 18, 2019, Bochy announced that the season would be his last, thus ending the tenure of the longest-serving active manager in Major League Baseball. He is the only manager in Major League history to win at least 900 games with two different teams.\n\nOn 9 December 2019, Bochy was named Manager of the France national baseball team. He will lead Les Bleus in their quest for a qualification at the 2021 World Baseball Classic.\n\nBochy is one of just eight Major Leaguers to be born in France (in Bussac-Forêt, Charente-Maritime), where his father, Sgt. Major Gus Bochy, was stationed as a U.S. Army NCO at the time. Growing up, Bochy moved with his family to the Panama Canal Zone, South Carolina, northern Virginia, and ultimately Melbourne, Florida.\n\nBochy graduated from Melbourne High School, where he was a baseball teammate of Darrell Hammond of \"Saturday Night Live\" fame. He was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 8th round of the 1975 amateur draft but did not sign. He attended Brevard Community College (later known as Eastern Florida State College) for two years on a partial scholarship, winning a state championship in 1975, before committing to play baseball for Eddie Stanky at South Alabama, but he decided to turn pro when he was drafted in the first round (24th overall) by the Houston Astros in the 1975 Supplemental Draft.\n\nAs a catcher, Bochy played with the Houston Astros (1978–80), New York Mets (1982) and San Diego Padres (1983–87). In 802 career at-bats, he hit .239 with 26 home runs. With the Astros, he primarily backed up Alan Ashby. Bochy was traded to the Mets on February 11, 1981, for two minor leaguers. Two years later, he was released by the Mets and signed with the Padres as a free agent. With the Padres, he was the backup to Terry Kennedy from 1983–86 and rookie catcher Benito Santiago in 1987. In 1988, Bochy spent his final season playing in Triple-A Las Vegas where he served as a player-coach, batting .231 in 53 games.\n\nWith the Astros, Bochy was behind the plate in Game 4 of the 1980 NLCS versus the Philadelphia Phillies when Pete Rose ran over Bochy to score the go-ahead run in the top of the tenth inning. Bochy was the backup to Terry Kennedy when the Padres won their first NL pennant in 1984, and he played in one game in the 1984 World Series, which the Padres lost in five games to the Detroit Tigers. On July 1, 1985, Bochy hit a tenth-inning walk-off home run off Nolan Ryan of the Houston Astros, the only walk-off home run allowed in Ryan's career. Bochy was behind the plate on September 11, 1985, when Pete Rose, now with the Cincinnati Reds, collected his record-breaking 4,192nd major league hit off Padres pitcher Eric Show.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Bochy was hired by Padres general manager Jack McKeon to manage in their minor league system. He started the 1989 season assisting the Class-A Riverside Red Wave before leaving to manage the Short-Season Class-A Spokane Indians, leading them to their third consecutive championship. In 1990, Bochy took over as manager of the Red Wave, finishing with a 64–78 record. In 1991, Bochy followed the team to Adelanto, California, where they became the High Desert Mavericks, and led them to a 73–63 record and California League title. In 1992, Bochy was promoted to manager of the Double-A Wichita Wranglers, leading them to the Texas League title that year.\n\nAfter four years of managing for their minor league teams, the San Diego Padres picked Bochy to be the team's third-base coach under new manager Jim Riggleman in 1993. Following the departure of Riggleman after the 1994 season, the Padres named Bochy as their new manager for the 1995 season. At age 39, Bochy became the youngest manager in the National League and helped the Padres improve from 47–70 in 1994 to 70–74 in his rookie year.\nIn 1996, his second season, Bochy led the Padres to a 91–71 record and their second National League West division title in franchise history, earning Bochy National League Manager of the Year and \"Sporting News\" National League Manager of the Year honors. In 1998, Bochy led the Padres to a franchise-best 98–64 record and the second National League pennant in Padres history, earning \"Sporting News\" Manager of the Year honors for the second time. The Padres were swept in four games in the 1998 World Series by the New York Yankees.\n\nAfter the World Series, the Padres dramatically cut payroll and suffered five straight losing seasons. In 2005 and 2006, Bochy led the Padres to consecutive NL West titles for the first time in franchise history, but they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the Division Series each year. Reliever Trevor Hoffman saved 457 games managed by Bochy, the most saves by one pitcher under one manager in Major League history, according to NBC Sports Bay Area. After the 2006 season, new Padres CEO Sandy Alderson preferred to have a younger manager, so he allowed Giants General Manager Brian Sabean to interview Bochy for his job opening.\n\nBochy left the Padres for the Giants after the 2006 season. He finished his Padres career with a regular season record of 951–975 and a post–season record of 8–16. Bochy has the most games managed in Padres history and with that, the most wins and losses. In 12 seasons under Bochy, the Padres had five winning seasons and won four NL West titles and one NL pennant. While with the Padres, Bochy also managed the 2004 and 2006 MLB All-Stars in the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series. The Padres have not made the playoffs since Bochy left the team following the 2006 season.\n\nBochy agreed to a three-year contract to replace Felipe Alou and become the Giants' new manager on October 27, 2006. After two seasons of 90+ losses in 2007 and 2008, the Giants rebounded to finish 88–74 in 2009, and remained in the playoff race into September behind a pitching staff with the second-lowest ERA in the Majors. After the season, Bochy received a new two-year contract with an option for 2012.\n\nIn 2010, the Giants finished 92–70 and clinched their first NL West title since 2003 on the final day of the regular season against the Padres. Underdogs throughout the postseason, Bochy's \"bunch of castoffs and misfits\" defeated the Atlanta Braves in the 2010 NLDS and the reigning 2-time National League champion (who had won a World Series during that stretch) Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS. The Giants defeated the Texas Rangers in five games in the 2010 World Series, bringing the first World Series championship to San Francisco and the Giants' first title since 1954 when the team was based in New York City. Following the season, the Giants exercised Bochy's 2012 contract option.\n\nIn 2011, the Giants finished 86–76 and missed the playoffs. After the season, the Giants extended Bochy's contract through 2013, with an option for 2014. In 2012, the Giants clinched the NL West for the second time in three years against the Padres, finishing with a 94–68 record. In the postseason, the Giants fell behind the Cincinnati Reds 0–2 in the 2012 NLDS before winning three straight games to stave off elimination. In the NLCS, the Giants fell behind the St. Louis Cardinals three games to one, but again won three straight elimination games to clinch their second National League pennant in three seasons. The Giants swept the 2012 World Series against the Detroit Tigers in four games. After the season, Bochy said the tagline for 2012 was \"never say die\".\n\nBefore the 2013 season, the Giants extended Bochy's contract through 2016. Bochy became the 21st manager with 1,500 wins on July 23, 2013. The Giants finished the season 76–86 and missed the playoffs in 2013. When Jim Leyland retired after the 2013 season, Bochy became MLB's active leader in wins with 1,530. In 2014, Bochy became the 19th manager to reach 1,600 wins on August 27, and also became the all-time NL Western Division leader in managerial wins, passing Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda for that distinction, since the installment of division play in 1969.\n\nWith an 88–74 record, the Giants made the 2014 postseason as the second wild-card team. During a low point of the regular season, Bochy told his players they had \"champion blood\", referring to the Giants' 2010 and 2012 championships. After defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the NL Wild Card Game, the Giants beat the heavily favored Washington Nationals three games to one in the NLDS and the St. Louis Cardinals four games to one in the NLCS for their third NL pennant in five years. Bochy's \"group of warriors\" went on to defeat the Kansas City Royals to win the 2014 World Series, a series that went the full seven games. Bochy became the tenth manager in MLB history to win three championships, with the previous nine all inducted into the Hall of Fame. \n\nOn April 3, 2015, the Giants announced Bochy had signed a contract extension through the 2019 season. On June 10, 2015, Bochy recorded his 700th win as Giants manager, making him the fourth in history to win at least 700 games for two different teams, joining Sparky Anderson, Tony La Russa, and Jim Leyland. The milestone came on the same night that Chris Heston threw a no-hitter for the Giants, the fifth no-hitter by the Giants under Bochy (Jonathan Sánchez in 2009; Matt Cain's perfect game in 2012; and Tim Lincecum in 2013 and 2014). On September 27, 2015, Bochy became the 16th manager to record 1,700 wins. The Giants finished with an 84–78 record and missed the playoffs in 2015.\n\nOn June 26, 2016, Bochy recorded his 800th win as Giants manager. On June 30, Bochy became the first manager since 1976 to intentionally forfeit the designated hitter, allowing Madison Bumgarner to bat for himself against the Oakland Athletics. With an 87–75 record, the Giants made the 2016 postseason as the second wild-card team, clinching on the final day of the regular season. The Giants defeated the New York Mets 3–0 in the NL Wild Card Game, their 11th straight postseason series win, dating back to 2010. The Giants lost the 2016 NLDS in four games to the Chicago Cubs, their first postseason series loss under Bochy.\n\nOn April 9, 2017, at Petco Park, in a 5–3 win over the San Diego Padres, Bochy tied Dusty Baker with his 840th career managerial win for the Giants in the San Francisco Era. The next day, in the Giants' home opener at AT&T Park and a 4–1 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks, Bochy surpassed Baker to become the all-time San Francisco Giants managerial wins leader. On May 3, 2017, Bochy became the 15th manager to reach 1,800 wins. On September 25 at Chase Field, in a 9–2 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks, Bochy won his 900th career game as manager of the San Francisco Giants, making him the first manager in Major League history to win 900 games with two different teams. Expected to be postseason contenders in 2017, the Giants instead fell to 64–98, matching Bochy's worst record as a manager, and the Giants' worst since 1985.\n\nOn July 29, 2018, Bochy recorded his 1,906th career victory as manager, surpassing Casey Stengel into 11th place on MLB's career wins list. Numerous injuries and an underperforming offense resulted in the Giants finishing 73–89 in 2018. With Mike Scioscia stepping down as the Los Angeles Angels manager on the last day of the 2018 MLB season, Bochy entered the 2019 season as the longest-tenured manager in Major League Baseball.\n\nOn February 18, 2019, Bochy announced he would retire following the conclusion of the 2019 season. On June 4 at Citi Field, in a 9-3 win over the New York Mets, Bochy won his 1,000th game as manager of the Giants. Bochy became the 25th manager to win 1,000 games with one team and he also joins John McGraw as the only two managers in Giants franchise history to reach the milestone and the first in San Francisco. On August 25, 2019, Bochy managed his 4,000th career game. He is only the eighth manager to manage 4,000 games. On September 18, 2019, Bochy won his 2,000th career game as a manager. He is the eleventh manager to win 2,000 games. The other ten managers are all in the Hall of Fame.\n\nBochy finished his Giants managerial career with a regular season record of 1052–1054 and a post–season record of 36–17. In 13 seasons under Bochy, the Giants had seven winning seasons, four playoff appearances, and three NL pennants and World Series championships. After retiring as manager, Bochy served in a front office role with the Giants.\n\n\nBochy is the third of four children. His older brother Joe was a one-time catcher in the Minnesota Twins system, and later worked as a professional scout for the Padres and Giants.\n\nBochy met his wife, Kim Seib, while at Brevard Community College in 1975 and they married in 1978. They reside in Poway, California and have two sons, Greg and Brett. Greg Bochy spent several seasons playing minor league baseball in the San Diego Padres system. Bochy's younger son, Brett Bochy, was drafted by the Giants in 2010. Brett was called up to the majors on September 2, 2014, making Bruce the seventh manager in MLB history to manage his own son. On September 13, 2014, Bruce became the first manager to give the ball to his son coming out of the bullpen.\n\nBochy is known for having one of the largest cap sizes in Major League Baseball. With Houston, his nickname was \"Headly,\" due to his unusually large head, with a hat size measurement of 8. When he joined the Mets in 1982, they did not have a helmet that would fit him, and they had to send for the ones he was using in the minors.\n\nOn February 19, 2015, Bochy underwent angioplasty to have two stents inserted in a blood vessel that was 90 percent blocked. On August 8, 2016, Bochy was hospitalized overnight for an irregular heartbeat and underwent a cardioversion procedure, missing one game. On April 18, 2017, Bochy underwent a minor heart ablation to reduce discomfort, mostly due to an atrial flutter, and missed two games. After the 2017 season, Bochy underwent another ablation procedure to treat an atrial fibrillation.\n\nIn May 2011, Bochy won the Ronald L. Jensen Award for Lifetime Achievement, which he accepted at Positive Coaching Alliance's National Youth Sports Awards. In 2011, the baseball field at Brevard Community College was named Bruce Bochy Field in his honor. In 2015, Bochy released \"A Book of Walks\" (), describing his favorite walks around San Francisco and other major league cities.\n\nBochy has rated Johnny Bench as the first choice on \"His Top Five Catchers, All-Time\" list, with the following in descending order: Carlton Fisk, Yogi Berra, Thurman Munson, and Iván Rodríguez.\n\n\n\n"}

Its first African-American student was enrolled in 1902; its first female student in 1922.\n\nIn 1919, the Knights of Columbus founded an educational program known as Columbus University which provided an evening education program for Catholic war veterans returning from World War I. This institution was closely affiliated with Catholic University and shared faculty at both institutions' Washington, D.C. locations.\n\nIn 1954 Columbus University (now consisting only of an evening law school) merged with Catholic University's law school to form the Columbus School of Law. The law school has been accredited by the Association of American Law Schools since 1921 and the American Bar Association since 1925.\n\nCatholic University's J.D. program can be completed over three years of full-time day study or four years of part-time evening study.\n\nThe first-year curriculum is prescribed for all students. The day-division curriculum consists of seven required courses totaling 29 credit hours. Evening-division students are required to complete the same basic courses within the first two years of their law school career. Revised for 2013, the new curriculum is designed to strengthen first-year doctrinal courses, to support the development of practice-area concentrations, and to emphasize training that will help graduates transition to the real world of practice.\n\nThe upper-division curriculum comprises several requirements, courses that are strongly recommended, and elective options. CUA Law students must complete a minimum of 84 credits to earn the J.D. degree. Required upper division courses include Constitutional Law II, Professional Responsibility, Professional Skills, and Upper-Level Writing. The law school is developing a Transition-to-Practice requirement for students. This new requirement is expected to be fulfilled by taking either a clinical course, or a capstone course. Foundational courses for all areas of legal practice—and thus strongly recommended for all Upper Division students— include Evidence, Corporations, and Criminal Procedure.\n\nTo respond to increasing demand for specialized legal services, the Law School has developed practice-area concentrations for upper division students in Civil Litigation, Criminal Litigation, Family Law, Intellectual Property, Labor and Employment Law and Securities Regulation.\n\nIn addition to the J.D. program, the school offers LL.M. programs in Law & Technology, Securities Law, and Comparative and International Law.\n\nThe school also offers an LL.M. program in American law with the Faculty of Law and Administration of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland. It allows Jagiellonian law students and students enrolled in the CUA-JU LL.M. program to study the essential substantive and procedural elements of the legal system of the United States.\n\nThe school offers a M.L.S. degree program, which enhances the ability of professionals to work with lawyers and legal issues, to gain a deeper knowledge of a particular legal field, and to understand laws and regulations. Students can choose to concentrate in the fields of Compliance and Corporate Responsibility, Employment and Human Resources, or Intellectual Property. Alternatively, students may choose a General U.S. Law option, which provides a broad overview of the law and legal practice.\n\nCUA Law had 42 full-time faculty members as of 2013. The school's student-faculty ratio was 10.27 to 1.\n\nCUA Law offers five opportunities for specialized legal study; four of them are certificate-granting.

Stiltskin's longest-standing current member is frontman Ray Wilson. They are best known for their 1994 UK chart-topper, \"Inside\".\n\nThe band was put together by multi-instrumentalist/songwriter Peter Lawlor to front the record he had made of the music he had written for the British Levi's television advertisement, \"Creek\". The resulting single, \"Inside\" topped the UK Singles Chart in 1994, but the band failed to produce further matching chart success with the follow-up single \"Footsteps\" reaching No. 34. The Ambrosian Singers performed Lawlor's choir-like intro vocals to \"Inside\". All instruments on the band's hit \"Inside\" were played by Peter Lawlor; this was also the case on the album track \"An Illusion\". The original line-up released only one album, \"The Mind's Eye\", which achieved a silver record in the UK, and sold in decent quantities throughout Europe. The band made significant critical inroads in the US music scene, but little was to follow in the way of sales, though \"Inside\" reached No. 37 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.\n\nThe original Stiltskin disbanded in 1996, during the recording of their uncompleted second album, for which James Finnigan had been replaced on bass by Aubrey Nunn, who later worked with Faithless.\n\nLawlor continued to run Water Music, writing and producing many high-profile themes: he wrote all of the music for the \"BBC One 'Rhythm & Movement' idents\" and also the theme for the 2000 Olympic Games coverage, and the theme for Premier League and FA Cup football matches shown on TV. Simultaneously, he worked as a city economist and academic economics lecturer, becoming the Chief Economist at the German Stock Exchange \"Deutsche Boerse'.\n\nMcFarlane went on to work with The Proclaimers and achieved another number one in the UK Singles Chart. He went on to join the band Texas in 2009, leaving in early 2019.\n\nWilson joined Genesis and recorded \"Calling All Stations\" with the band (released in 1997) and toured Europe the following year. In 1999 he formed Cut_. In 2002 he launched a solo career. \n\nIn 2005, Wilson put a new band together under the name Stiltskin. Wilson himself and touring keyboardist Irvin Duguid (who later left the line-up) were the only members from the original line-up.\n\nThe new incarnation of Stiltskin released the album \"She\" in 2006. They toured Europe during 2006 and 2007, and a live album entitled \"Stiltskin Live\", recorded on 25 October 2006, with material from this tour, was released in April 2007.

It is one of several radiometric dating techniques exploiting the uranium radioactive decay series, in which U undergoes 14 alpha and beta decay events on the way to the stable isotope Pb. Other dating techniques using this decay series include uranium–thorium dating and uranium–lead dating.\n\nU, with a half-life of about 4.5 billion years, decays to U through emission of an alpha particle to thorium-234 (Th), which is comparatively unstable with a half-life of just 24 days. Th then decays through beta particle emission to protactinium-234 (Pa)). This decays with a half-life of 6.7 hours, again through emission of a beta particle, to U. This isotope has a half-life of about 245,000 years. The next decay product, thorium-230 (Th), has a half-life of about 75,000 years and is used in the uranium-thorium technique. Although analytically simpler, in practice U/U requires knowledge of the ratio at the time the material under study was formed and is generally used only for samples older than the ca. 450,000 year upper limit of the Th/U technique. For those materials (principally marine carbonates) for which these conditions apply, it remains a superior technique.\n\nUnlike other radiometric dating techniques, those using the uranium decay series (except for those using the stable final isotopes Pb and Pb) compare the ratios of two radioactive unstable isotopes. This complicates calculations as both the parent and daughter isotopes decay over time into other isotopes.\n\nIn theory, the U/U technique can be useful in dating samples between about 10,000 and 2 million years Before Present (BP), or up to about eight times the half-life of U. As such, it provides a useful bridge in radiometric dating techniques between the ranges of Th/U (accurate up to ca. 450,000 years) and U–Pb dating (accurate up to the age of the solar system, but problematic on samples younger than about 2 million years).\n\n"}
{"id": "2194894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194894", "title": "Livin' Joy", "text": "Livin' Joy\n\nLivin' Joy was an Italian Eurodance group who released two successful hits during the mid-1990s, \"Dreamer\" and \"Don't Stop Movin'\". The group consisted of Italian brothers Paolo and Gianni Visnadi (also members of Alex Party) and singers Tameka Starr and Janice Robinson.\n\nOriginally released by Undiscovered Recordings in 1994, Livin' Joy were fronted by American lead singer Janice Robinson and reached number one on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart with \"Dreamer\". The song turned out to be a mild sleeper hit on pop radio, finally entering the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in early 1995. It peaked at number 72 and spent seventeen weeks on the chart. The song had a more successful run in the United Kingdom, hitting the number one spot after being re-issued. In its original run in late 1994, \"Dreamer\" peaked at No. 18, spending 6 straight weeks in the UK top 100. It did re-enter the lower ends of the top 100 two more times that year bringing its total to 12 weeks inside the top 100.\n\nBy the end of 1995, the re-issue of \"Dreamer\" ranked as the UK's 40th best selling single of the year logging a total of 21 weeks in the top 100.\n\nIn mid-1996, \"Dreamer\" re-entered the U.S. Hot 100 chart, this time peaking at number 95.\n\nBy 1996, Robinson had left - thus marking a new era for the group. She was replaced by American vocalist Tameka Starr, who was also the songwriter and choreographer. Starr's lyrics encapsulated a more 'uplifting' and 'motivational' approach to the content of the songs during this era of Livin' Joy. \nWith Starr on lead vocals, the follow-up single \"Don't Stop Movin'\" peaked at number five in the UK and went on to become a big summer hit. It spent 14 consecutive weeks in the top 100, with 7 of those in the top 10.\n\n\"Don't Stop Movin'\" topped the Italian charts in 1996 and also peaked at number three on the U.S. dance chart in early 1997 and became another modest, although long-lived, hit in the mainstream - climbing to number 67 on the Hot 100, spending twenty weeks on the chart. In Australia, \n\"Don't Stop Movin'\" peaked at number 6 on the national ARIA singles chart.\n\n\"Don't Stop Movin'\" was followed by another Top 10 hit single in the UK, \"Follow the Rules\" which peaked at No. 9 on 2 November 1996, scoring Livin' Joy a hat-trick of top 10s at this point.\n\n\"Follow the Rules\" was based around the subject of following your dreams and making them come true. The song wasn't as successful as its two predecessors; although peaking at No. 9 in the UK, it spent only a week in the top 10 before descending out of the top 100 after a total of 7 weeks on the chart.\n\n\"Where Can I Find Love\" managed only 4 weeks in the UK top 100 chart.\n\nLivin' Joy's fourth charting release in the UK was \"Deep in You\". The track took on a completely different sound which had a more R&B feel. Although moderately successful, peaking at No. 17 in the UK, it slowly descended out of the top 100 just 4 weeks after its release.\n\n\"Where Can I Find Love\" was Livin' Joy's fifth and final single. Released on 4 May 1998 in the United Kingdom, it peaked at No. 12 on the UK charts. \nLyrically, the track focusses on the struggles to find true love. This was further fleshed out with the accompanying music video featuring Tameka walking around a nightclub, bumping into various men who catch her attention. Each man is then shown to have an 'issue' which leaves Tameka disappointed.\n\n\"Don't Stop Movin\"', was the parent album and grouped together the hits, including \"Dreamer\" with new vocals by Starr (although the original version with Robinson was a hidden bonus track). The album was released in the UK on 16 November 1996 (a week after the release of their third single \"Follow the Rules\"). The album peaked at No. 41 on the UK Albums Chart, and remained on the chart for only two weeks.\n\nPlans for a widespread commercial release of a single entitled \"Just for the Sex of It\" in 1999 were scrapped, due to a label merger between MCA and Polygram who became Universal. With an entire new staff, there was a lack of interest in the 2nd album. It only received a limited club run, but was released as a single in Australia and the UK, and proved popular in the clubs. In 2008, tracks from the eventually-cancelled follow-up album, \"Just for the Sex of It\", were leaked online and they included: \"Love Yourself\", \"Lookin' Fine\", \"I Only Wanna Dance\", \"U R My Livin' Joy\", \"You Don't Love Me\", and \"Bump This\".\n\nJanice Robinson subsequently re-released 2005 remixes of \"Dreamer\", credited as a solo release, which charted at No. 5 on the U.S. dance chart.\n\n"}

The reservation is located almost entirely in Stevens County, but also includes two small parcels of land (totaling about ) in Lincoln County, including part of the Spokane River. In total, the reservation is about .\n\nThe city of Spokane, Washington (Sʎˈetkʷ) is named after the tribe. It developed along the Spokane River, within the historic ancestral land of the tribe, but not within the reservation (see map).\n\nThe Spokane language (Npoqínišcn) belongs to the Interior Salishan language family, being a dialect of Montana Salish. Therefore they are close kin both by language and culture to the neighboring Bitterroot Salish (Flathead) (Tˈatˈʔayaqn) and Pend d'Oreilles. They were in loose alliance with other Plateau tribes - and sometimes the Kutenai (Sqlˈse), Crow Nation (Stemčiʔ) and Cree-Assiniboine (Iron Confederacy) (Ncoʕʷaqs) joined in - against their common enemy (Sˈmen), the mighty Blackfoot Confederacy (Sčqˈʷišni) and later Lakota people (Hułnʔixʷtˈusm) on the east. The precontact population of the Spokane people is estimated to be about 1,400 to 2,500 people. The populations of the tribe began to diminish after contact with settlers and traders due to mortality from new infectious diseases endemic among the Europeans, and to which the Spokane had no acquired immunity. By 1829 a Hudson Bay Company trader estimated there were about 700 Spokane people in the area. Since the early 20th century, their population has been steadily increasing: in 1985 tribal enrolled membership was reported as 1,961. In 2000 the US census reported the resident population of the reservation to be around 2,000 people.\n\nDifferent hypotheses are presented for the origin and meaning of the name:\n\nFor thousands of years the Spokane people lived near the Spokane River in the territory of present-day eastern Washington and northern Idaho, surviving by hunting and gathering. Spokane territory once sprawled over three million acres (12,000 km²) of land. The Spokanes lived along the river in three bands known as the Upper, Middle and Lower Spokane Indians. The Spokane bands were semi nomadic, following game and plants on a seasonal basis for nine months of the year, and settling in permanent winter villages for the other three.\n\nThe first Europeans whom the Spokane people had contact with were fur traders and explorers. The Lewis and Clark expedition encountered the Spokane tribe in 1805. Already the Spokane people were dwindling in population from introduced Eurasian diseases, such as smallpox, which were endemic among Europeans. Shortly after the encounter with the Lewis and Clark expedition, fur traders and settlers arrived. In 1810, the North West Company opened the Spokane House near the confluence of the Spokane and Little Spokane (Nxweme'a'tkxy - \"river where the Steelhead trout run\") rivers as a trade post. The Pacific Fur Company established Fort Spokane (Čˈłyaqˈ) in 1811. Much later, the structure was used as an Indian boarding school for the Spokane children, from 1898 to 1906. The Spokane took prominent part in the so called Coeur d'Alene War (Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-Pend d'oreille-Paloos War) of 1858, a series of encounters between the allied Native American tribes of the Skitswish (\"Coeur d'Alene\"), Kalispell (\"Pend'Oreille\"), Spokane, Palouse and Northern Paiute against United States Army forces in Washington and Idaho which centered in ancestral Spokane territories.\n\nBy treaty between the federal government and the tribe, the people ceded most of their territory, accepting removal to the Spokane Reservation, which was established in 1881. In 1877, the Lower Spokane people (Scqesciłni) agreed to move to the Spokane Reservation. In 1887 the Upper (Sntʔtʔúlixʷ) and Middle Spokane people (Snxʷme̓nʔey) agreed to move to the Colville Reservation predominately inhabited by the Colville people (Sxʷyelpetkʷ). Not all the Spokane people moved from their traditional territory, which caused some conflict with white settlers. In the Coeur d'Alene War of 1858, the Spokane had allied with the Coeur d'Alene (Sčicwˈi), Yakima (Yiʔaqmeʔ), Palouse, and Paiute peoples against the European Americans. In the Nez Perce War of 1877, they remained neutral despite pleas from Nez Perce (Saʕaptni) chief Chief Joseph to join him in trying to expel the settlers. Prior to colonization by European-Americans, Chewelah was home to a band of the Kalispel people. The band was known as the slet̓éw̓si, meaning \"valley people\". The Chewelah Band of Indians is currently part of the Spokane Tribe.\n\nAround the 1950s, uranium was discovered on the reservation. With the development of nuclear weapons and other tools, it was considered highly valuable. It was mined (under leases arranged on behalf of the Spokane by the federal government) from 1956 to 1962 out of an open pit. This practice was ended, and from 1969 to 1982, uranium was mined at the Midnite Mine. The now inactive mine is on the list of Superfund cleanup sites, as the mining process left the grounds and underground water highly contaminated by metals, radionucleides and acidic drainage.\n\nThe creation of dams on the Spokane and related waterways, to generate hydroelectric power and provide water for irrigation in the arid eastern part of the state, has also affected the Spokane people. Construction of the Little Falls dam resulted in the end of most of the salmon run at Spokane Falls. The Grand Coulee Dam, on the Columbia River, blocked salmon from migrating upriver and ended all salmon runs on the Spokane River.\n\nThe Spokane tribe was divided into three geographic divisions, upper, lower, and middle. Each area was divided into bands, which were composed of groups of related families or kin groups.\n\nThe Upper Spokane or Sntʔtʔúlixʷ (Sntu't'ulixi) (\"People of the Falls\") resided along the Little Spokane River and all the country east of the Lower Spokane to within the borders of the Coeur d'Alene and Kalispel, sometimes their name is given as Sineka'lt (\"[People] at the Rapids\"). \nThe Middle Spokane or Snxʷme̓nʔey (Snx'w'meney) (\"People of the steelhead river, i.e. Little Spokane River\") occupied the area near Spokane Falls to Hangman (Latah) Creek and Deep Creek to Tum Tum, Middle Spokane territory includes Spokane House, the site of the first permanent white settlement in Washington State, another variant of their name is Snxwemi'ne (\"People of the steelhead trout place\"). \nThe Lower Spokane or Scqesciłni (Scqecioni) (\"People of Little Falls\") traditionally occupied the lower Spokane River from Little Falls to the confluence of the Columbia River, also known as Squasi'lni (\"Fishers\", after a settlement name).\n\nIndividual bands were led by a Ilmixʷm or chief and a sub chief, who were both selected to lead based on their leadership qualities. Decisions were made by consensus of the group.\n\nThe Spokane had a matrilocal custom, in which the husband of a Spokane woman, after marriage, would join her and her people as the site of their home together. Occasionally, the wife would move to the husband's people. There was mobility between bands, by which a person or family could spend one winter with a band and the next winter with another.\n\nThe Spokane diet consisted of fish, local game, and plants, including nuts and roots. The men hunted whitetail deer and mule deer, which provided essential protein and other nutrients in the winter. Individual hunters would track the deer and kill them using a bow and arrow. Fish, especially salmon, were a huge part of the Spokane diet and also a large part of the trade economy. The Spokane people also ate trout and whitefish. They would smoke or dry the fish for trade or for storage in winter. Fish eyes were considered delicacies. Plants gathered by women provided nearly half of the caloric intake for the Spokane tribe.\n\nMen of the Spokane tribe created tools, fished, and hunted. After the tribe acquired horses, the men cared for and trained these animals, and horses became a measure of wealth. The animals allowed the people to travel wider territories, and were used also to carry or pull their supplies. The men rode the horses during hunting and warfare. Horses were introduced to the Spokane tribe from either the Nez Perce, Kalispel, or Flathead tribe. By about 1800, the Spokane tribe was acquiring herds, showing that they had fully embraced use of these animals.\n\nSpokane women made coiled baskets out of birch bark (or from cedar roots). They wove wallets and bags from strips of processed animal hide. They would also sew mats and other items which were sometimes traded with other Native peoples and white traders and settlers. Some of the plants they gathered were camas roots and local berries and barks. The women used digging sticks to uproot and gather their food. It was a fundamental tool for their lives, and it was a rite of passage for young girls to be given their first digging sticks. Women's graves were often marked with these sticks.\n\nA Spokane religion was the Dreamer Cult, also called \"Washani,\" meaning \"worship\" or \"dancers\". It developed in the Columbia Plateau tribes and emerged from the pressures of colonization during the second half of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe Dreamer Cult developed as a mix of traditional spirituality and aspects of Christianity. The Dreamer prophets rejected non-Native culture and belief systems. The prophets advocated returning to traditional ways of life. \"[P]rior to contact, Plateau Indian spirituality revolved around a complex of Winter dances, personal vision quests, and seasonal feasts tied to the annual subsistence cycle and the acquisition of guardian spirit powers\"(Fisher).\n\nA few examples of spiritual dances include the Prophet Dance and the Spirit Dance, which took place in mid-January. Dancers sought to identify with the Prophet's spirit. In the Spirit Dance a shaman would call upon the spirit to visit an individual.\n\nIt is believed the prophet Smohalla in a vision \n\"foresaw the disappearance of the whites, the resurrection of the Indian dead, and the restoration of the world to a pristine state. This millennial transformation required no acts of violence — indeed, most Dreamers counseled pacifism — but to achieve it, the Indians had to obey the instructions of the Creator as conveyed through the prophets\" (Fisher).The Dreamer Cult remained prominent within the Columbia Plateau peoples until the early 1890s, when the major prophets died and their followers began to lose faith in the promise of a world free of white people. The closest contemporary religion to the Washani is the Seven Drums Religion.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The molecule is one of the three isomeric amines of pyridine. It is used as a research tool in characterizing subtypes of the potassium channel. It has also been used as a drug, to manage some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, and is indicated for symptomatic improvement of walking in adults with several variations of the disease. It was undergoing Phase III clinical trials , and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the compound on January 22, 2010. Fampridine is also marketed as Ampyra (pronounced \"am-PEER-ah,\" according to the maker's website) in the United States by Acorda Therapeutics and as Fampyra in Europe. In Canada, the medication has been approved for use by Health Canada since February 10, 2012.\n\n4-Aminopyridine is prepared by the decarbonylation of pyridine-4-carboxamide using sodium hypochlorite via the Hofmann rearrangement. The pyridine carboxamide is generated from the corresponding nitrile, which in turn is obtained from ammoxidation of 4-methylpyridine.\n\nIn the laboratory, 4-AP is a useful pharmacological tool in studying various potassium conductances in physiology and biophysics. It is a relatively selective blocker of members of Kv1 (Shaker, KCNA) family of voltage-activated K+ channels. However, 4-AP has been shown to potentiate voltage-gated Ca channel currents independent of effects on voltage-activated K+ channels.\n\n4-Aminopyridine is a potent convulsant and is used to generate seizures in animal models for the evaluation of antiseizure agents.\n\n4-Aminopyridine is also used under the trade name Avitrol as 0.5% or 1% in bird control bait. It causes convulsions and, infrequently, death, depending on dosage. The manufacturer says the proper dose should cause epileptic-like convulsions which cause the poisoned birds to emit distress calls resulting in the flock leaving the site; if the dose was sub-lethal, the birds will recover after 4 or more hours without long-term ill effect. The amount of bait should be limited so that relatively few birds are poisoned, causing the remainder of the flock to be frightened away with a minimum of mortality. A lethal dose will usually cause death within an hour. The use of 4-aminopyridine in bird control has been criticized by the Humane Society of the United States.\n\nFampridine has been used clinically in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and multiple sclerosis. It acts by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels, prolonging action potentials and thereby increasing neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction.\nThe drug has been shown to reverse saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin toxicity in tissue and animal experiments.\nIn calcium entry blocker overdose in humans, 4-aminopyridine can increase the cytosolic Ca2+\nconcentration very efficiently independent of the calcium channels.\n\nFampridine has been shown to improve visual function and motor skills and relieve fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the effect of the drug is strongly established for walking capacity only. Common side effects include dizziness, nervousness and nausea, and the incidence of adverse effects was shown to be less than 5% in all studies.\n\n4-AP works as a potassium channel blocker. Strong potassium currents decrease action potential duration and amplitude, which increases the probability of conduction failure − a well documented characteristic of demyelinated axons. Potassium channel blockade has the effect of increasing axonal action potential propagation and improving the probability of synaptic vesicle release. A study has shown that 4-AP is a potent calcium channel activator and can improve synaptic and neuromuscular function by directly acting on the calcium channel beta subunit.\n\nMS patients treated with 4-AP exhibited a response rate of 29.5% to 80%. A long-term study (32 months) indicated that 80-90% of patients who initially responded to 4-AP exhibited long-term benefits. Although improving symptoms, 4-AP does not inhibit progression of MS. Another study, conducted in Brazil, showed that treatment based on fampridine was considered efficient in 70% of the patients.\n\nSpinal cord injury patients have also seen improvement with 4-AP therapy. These improvements include sensory, motor and pulmonary function, with a decrease in spasticity and pain.\n\nDalfampridine completed Phase 2 clinical trials for Parkinson's disease in July 2014.\n\nClinical studies have shown that 4-AP is capable of reversing the effects of tetrodotoxin poisoning in animals, however, its effectiveness as an antidote in humans has not yet been determined.\n\nCase reports have shown that overdoses with 4-AP can lead to paresthesias, seizures, and atrial fibrillation.\n\n4-aminopyridine is excreted by the kidneys. 4-AP should not be given to people with significant kidney disease (e.g., acute kidney injury or advanced chronic kidney disease due to the higher risk of seizures with increased circulating levels of 4-AP.\n\nThe drug was originally intended, by Acorda Therapeutics, to have the brand name \"Amaya\", however the name was changed to \"Ampyra\" to avoid potential confusion with other marketed pharmaceuticals.\n\nFour of Acorda's patents pertaining to Ampyra were invalidated in 2017 by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and a fifth patent expired in 2018. Since then, generic alternatives have been developed for the U.S. market.\n\nThe drug is marketed by Biogen Idec in Canada as \"Fampyra\" and as \"Dalstep\" in India by Sun Pharma.\n\n\n"}

The movie was based on the 1941 play by Clifford Odets, adapted by writer Alfred Hayes. This was the first major film in which Monroe was credited before the movie's title, albeit with fourth billing.\n\nDuring the shooting, the now famous nude calendar photos of Monroe surfaced and reporters swarmed around and hounded the actress, creating considerable distraction for the film makers.\n\nMae Doyle returns to her home town, the fishing village of Monterey, California after 10 years \"back East.\" Joe, her fisherman brother, is not particularly pleased to see her, but accepts her back into the family home. His girlfriend Peggy is more welcoming. When Joe asks Mae about the rich man she was seeing, she explains he was a married politician. He died and left her some money, but his wife and relatives took her to court and won.\n\nMae begins to date Jerry D'Amato, a good-natured, unsophisticated fisherman with his own boat. Mae instantly despises Jerry's friend, Earl Pfeiffer, a bitter, dissatisfied film projectionist. Mae's politician lover had made her feel more confident in herself; in stark contrast, Earl has a low opinion of women in general and makes no attempt to hide it. His wife is a vaudeville performer who is away frequently on tour.\n\nEarl, sensing a kindred restless spirit, is attracted to Mae right away. Jerry is oblivious to the tension between the two and soon asks Mae to marry him, despite her warning that she is not good for him. Mae decides to accept, even though she does not love or even respect her future husband, for the security and in the hope that she can change.\n\nA year after having a baby girl with Jerry, Mae becomes bored and restless. Earl, now divorced, makes a move on Mae. She resists at first, but then begins an affair with him. Jerry's uncle Vince, who bears a grudge against Mae, knows of the affair and tells his disbelieving nephew. When Jerry confronts the couple, Mae admits that she wants to leave Jerry to be with Earl.\n\nAfter a few drinks and having been prodded by Vince, Jerry finds and starts strangling Earl, until Mae arrives and breaks up the fight. Jerry leaves, horrified that he came close to killing his friend. When Mae goes home to take her baby away, she finds the crib empty. Earl tries to coax Mae to leave with him anyway, without the baby, but this does not sit well with Mae. After trading bitter recriminations, she breaks up with him. Later, however, Mae repents and convinces Jerry to take her back.\n\n\nOdets' \"Clash by Night\" originally was performed in 1941 as a neo-realist Broadway play with Tallulah Bankhead in the Stanwyck role. Fritz Lang changed the locale from Staten Island to a fishing town in California, but he kept intact the oppressive seacoast atmosphere.\n\nThe drama is structured into two almost equal parts and each is almost a complete drama in its own. The two parts are separated by a year in time. Each section begins with a non-fiction, documentary look at the fishing industry in Monterey, California. It then moves on to the story. Arguably, the motion picture is two films: each of around an hour's length and strung together as a serial.\n\nThe title of the film comes from Matthew Arnold's poem \"Dover Beach\" (1851). Specifically: It is a place \"where ignorant armies clash by night.\"\n\nJoan Crawford originally was announced as star.\n\nWhen the film first opened the staff at \"Variety\" magazine was harsh on the film but appreciated Barbara Stanwyck's work, writing, \"Clifford Odets' \"Clash by Night,\" presented on Broadway over a decade earlier, reaches the screen in a rather aimless drama of lust and passion. \"Clash\" captures much of the drabness of the seacoast fishing town, background of the pic, but only occasionally does the narrative's suggested intensity seep through...Barbara Stanwyck plays the returning itinerant with her customary defiance and sullenness. It is one of her better performances. Robert Ryan plays the other man with grim brutality while Marilyn Monroe is reduced to what is tantamount to a bit role.\"\n\nCritic Sam Adams wrote about Fritz Lang directorial style, \"Restraint was never Fritz Lang's problem. Indeed, his version of Clifford Odets' \"Clash by Night\" is overwrought verging on camp... In \"Clash's\" wild kingdom, strong women can only be sated by the threat of male violence: After she marries sturdy lug Paul Douglas, Stanwyck is unerringly drawn towards Ryan's volatile woman-hater, while fish-canner Marilyn Monroe shows her affection to fiance Keith Andes by socking him in the arm, a gesture he threatens to return in spades. Lang tilled the same turf two years later in \"Human Desire\", a similarly heavy-handed expose of man's bestial nature. Perhaps Lang should have stuck with the style of \"Clash's\" extraordinary, near-wordless opening, which begins with shots of seagulls and seals and slowly mixes in the actors in their natural habitats.\"\n\nCritic Dennis Schwartz wrote, \"The performances are stagy but filled with fiery emotion. The performers are able to bring out the complexities underlying each of their characters as they battle each other, hoping not to die of loneliness or of cynicism. Everything about these characters and their alienation seemed natural, something that was grounded by Lang's showing them at work, never cutting them off from all the other travails they were going through. Lang's point is how easy it is not to see the faults in yourself, as easy as it is to see them in someone else. \"Clash by Night\" brilliantly tells how some lonely folks break out from their shadowy existence, as if that darkness was a prison where survival at any cost is the name of the game.\"\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 73% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 15 reviews, marking the film as \"Fresh.\"\n\nAnother production of the Odets play was directed by John Frankenheimer for \"Playhouse 90\" on June 13, 1957 with Kim Stanley in the lead role.\n\n"}

{"id": "2194942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194942", "title": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York", "text": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York is one of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks of the United States. It is located at 33 Liberty Street, New York, New York. It is responsible for the Second District of the Federal Reserve System, which encompasses New York State, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey, Fairfield County in Connecticut, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Working within the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York implements monetary policy, supervises and regulates financial institutions and helps maintain the nation's payment systems.\n\nAmong the other regional banks, the New York Fed and its president are considered first among equals. Its current president is John C. Williams. It is by far the largest (by assets), most active (by volume) and most influential of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York opened for business on November 16, 1914, under the leadership of Benjamin Strong Jr., who had previously been president of the Bankers Trust Company. He led the Bank until his death in 1928. Strong became the executive officer (then called the \"governor\"—today, the term would be \"president\"). As the leader of the Federal Reserve's largest and most powerful district bank, Strong became a dominant force in U.S. monetary and banking affairs. One biographer has termed him the \"de facto leader of the entire Federal Reserve System\". This was not only because of Strong's abilities, but also because the central board's powers were ambiguous and, for the most part, limited to supervisory and regulatory functions under the 1913 Federal Reserve Act because many Americans were antagonistic to centralized control.\n\nWhen the United States entered World War I, Strong was a major force behind the campaigns to fund the war effort via bonds owned primarily by U.S. citizens. This enabled the United States to avoid many of the post-war financial problems of the European belligerents. Strong gradually recognized the importance of open market operation, or purchases and sales of government securities, as a means of managing the quantity of money in the U.S. economy and thus affecting interest rates. This was particularly important at the time because gold had flooded into the United States during and after World War I. Thus, its gold-backed currency was well-protected, but prices had been pushed up substantially by the currency expansion due to the gold standard-imposed expansion of currency. In 1922, Strong unofficially scrapped the gold standard and instead began aggressively pursuing open market operations as a means of stabilizing domestic prices and thus internal economic stability. Thus, he began the Federal Reserve's practice of buying and selling government securities as monetary policy. John Maynard Keynes, a prominent British economist who had previously not questioned the gold standard, used Strong's activities as an example of how a central bank could manage a nation's economy without the gold standard in his book \"A Tract on Monetary Reform\" (1923). To quote one authority:\n\nIt was Strong more than anyone else who invented the modern central banker. When we watch ... [central bankers of today] describe how they are seeking to strike the right balance between economic growth and price stability, it is the ghost of Benjamin Strong who hovers above him. It all sounds quite prosaically obvious now, but in 1922 it was a radical departure from more than two hundred years of central banking history.\n\nStrong's policy of maintaining price levels during the 1920s through open market operation and his willingness to maintain the liquidity of banks during panics have been praised by monetarists and harshly criticized by Austrian economists.\n\nWith the European economic turmoil of the 1920s, Strong's influence became worldwide. He was a strong supporter of European efforts to return to the gold standard and economic stability. Strong's new monetary policies not only stabilized U.S. prices, they encouraged both U.S. and world trade by helping to stabilize European currencies and finances. However, with virtually no inflation, interest rates were low and the U.S. economy and corporate profits surged, fueling the stock market increases of the late 1920s. This worried him, but he also felt he had no choice because the low interest rates were helping Europeans (particularly Great Britain) in their effort to return to the gold standard.\n\nEconomic historian Charles P. Kindleberger states that Strong was one of the few U.S. policymakers interested in the troubled financial affairs of Europe in the 1920s, and that had he not died in 1928, just a year before the Great Depression, he might have been able to maintain stability in the international financial system.\n\nA public competition for the design of the building was held and the architectural firm of York and Sawyer submitted the winning design. The bank moved to the new Federal Reserve Bank of New York Building in 1924. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York maintains a vault that lies below street level and below sea level, resting on Manhattan bedrock. By 1927, the vault contained 10% of the world's official gold reserves.\n\nOn October 17, 2012, Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis, 21, was arrested while attempting to detonate what he believed to be an 800-pound bomb. A joint FBI/NYPD operation flagged the suspect on the Internet and set up the sting with fake explosives. In 2013, Nafis pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York publishes a monthly recession probability prediction derived from the yield curve and based on the work by Arturo Estrella & Tobias Adrian.\n\nTheir models show that, when the difference between short-term interest rates (using three-month T-bills) and long-term interest rates (using ten-year Treasury bonds) at the end of a Federal Reserve tightening cycle is negative or less than 93 basis points positive, a rise in unemployment usually occurs.\n\nSince the founding of the Federal Reserve banking system, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Manhattan's Financial District has been the place where monetary policy in the United States is implemented, although policy is decided in Washington, D.C. by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is the largest in terms of assets of the twelve regional banks. Operating in the financial capital of the U.S., the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is responsible for conducting open market operations, the buying and selling of outstanding U.S. Treasury securities. The Trading Desk is the office at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that manages the FOMC Directive to sell or buy bonds. Note that the responsibility for \"issuing\" new U.S. Treasury securities lies with the Bureau of the Public Debt. In 2003, Fedwire, the Federal Reserve's system for transferring balances between it and other banks, transferred $1.8 trillion a day in funds, of which about $1.1 trillion originated in the Second District. It transferred an additional $1.3 trillion a day in securities, of which $1.2 trillion originated in the Second District. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is also responsible for carrying out exchange rate policy by buying and selling dollars at the discretion of the United States Treasury Department. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is the only regional bank with a permanent vote on the Federal Open Market Committee and its president is traditionally selected as the Committee's vice chairman.Currently, it is reputedly the largest gold repository in the world (though this cannot be confirmed as Swiss banks do not report their gold stocks) and holds approximately of gold bullion ($415 billion as of October 2011), more than Fort Knox. Nearly 98% of the gold at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is owned by the central banks of foreign nations. The rest is owned by the United States and international organizations such as the IMF. The Federal Reserve Bank does not own the gold but serves as guardian of the precious metal, which it stores at no charge to the owners, but charging a $1.75 fee (in 2008) per bar to move the gold.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York Buffalo Branch was formerly the sole branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It was formally disbanded on October 31, 2008.\n\nIn 2009, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York commissioned a probe into its own practices. David Beim, finance professor at Columbia Business School submitted a report in 2009, released by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2011, saying \"that a number of people he interviewed at the reserve bank believe that supervisors paid excessive deference to banks and, as a result, they were less aggressive in finding issues or in following up on them in a forceful way\".\n\nFollowing Stephen Friedman's resignation on 7 May 2009, Denis Hughes, formerly Deputy Chair, was designated as Interim Chair. The current Chair (for 2013) is Emily Rafferty, President of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nIn 2012, Carmen Segarra, then Federal Reserve Bank of New York bank examiner, told her superiors that Goldman Sachs had no policy governing conflicts of interest. She was \"fired in May 2012 after refusing to change her findings on the conflict-of-interest policy and sued the New York Fed October 2013\".\n\nIn April 2014 the U.S. District court in Manhattan dismissed the case, \"ruling that Segarra failed to make a legally sufficient claim under the whistle-blower protections of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act\".\n\nIn September 2014, Segarra's secretly recorded conversations were aired by \"This American Life\" and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was accused of political corruption by being a \"captured agency\", \"i.e.\", subject to regulatory capture, of the banks which it supervises.\n\nThe following people serve on the board of directors . Terms expire on December 31 of their final year on the board.\n\n\nIn the first \"Godfather\" movie, the \"meeting of the Dons\" scene uses the Federal Reserve building exterior, even though the interior of another New York building (the Penn Central railway boardroom) was also used for filming.\n\nIn the 1974 film \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\" hijackers take over a subway train car and demand $1 million for release of the car and 19 passengers, and the city must deliver it to the train car within one hour or the hijackers will start executing passengers at the rate of one per minute until it's delivered. The money for the ransom, to be provided in bundles of used $50 and $100 bills, is frantically assembled by workers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York while a police cruiser waits at the front entrance for it to be assembled for delivery.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York plays a prominent role in the 1995 film \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\", starring Bruce Willis and Jeremy Irons. The Federal Reserve Bank is the setting for a major heist of the gold by Jeremy Irons' character, Simon Gruber.

The Bowery Ballroom holds something of a cult status among musicians as well as audiences. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine has awarded it #1 Best Club in America. \"It's both intimate and grand, with consistently great sound and sightlines, and touches of old-school class, like 84-year-old bronze rails.\" It has a capacity of 575 people.\n\nThe Bowery Ballroom was founded in 1998 by Michael Swier, Michael Winsch, and Brian Swier, who still own and operate the business. The club was the team's second music venue after The Mercury Lounge.\n\nThe building at 6 Delancey Street was built to be a high-end shoe store and haberdashery just before the devastating Wall Street Crash of 1929. It stood vacant until the end of World War II, when it housed a series of shops. Over time the neighborhood declined. In 1998 the building was fully renovated to become The Bowery Ballroom.\n\nCofounder Michael Swier told the \"Village Voice\" and \"LA Weekly\" that he and his partners' goals have always been about quality of sound, as well as giving the best experience to both artists and the audience.\n\nArchitect and cofounder Brian Swier designed the venue and directed renovations of the historic building with an eye to optimal acoustics for live music. Today the club is one of the rare remaining independent music venues, and continues to be regarded as one of the best for music purists. Both \"Gothamist\" and \"Thrillist\" tout it as one of New York City's best Music Venues.\n\n“From the beginning, opening the Mercury Lounge, it was all about the stage and the music — for the band, for the people coming to see the bands,” Michael Swier says. “Whether it's the sound system, the acoustic treatment, the way the band sounds to themselves onstage, the sightlines — it was all about that.

{"id": "2194994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194994", "title": "Greece in the Roman era", "text": "Greece in the Roman era\n\nGreece in the Roman era describes the period of Greek history when Ancient Greece was dominated by the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire (27 BC – AD 1453) commonly referred to as the Byzantine Empire after about AD 395. The Roman era of Greek history began with the Corinthian defeat in the Battle of Corinth in 146 BC. However, before the Achaean War, the Roman Republic had been steadily gaining control of mainland Greece by defeating the Kingdom of Macedon in a series of conflicts known as the Macedonian Wars. The Fourth Macedonian War ended at the Battle of Pydna in 148 BC and defeat of the Macedonian royal pretender Andriscus.\n\nThe definitive Roman occupation of the Greek world was established after the Battle of Actium (31 BC), in which Augustus defeated Cleopatra VII, the Greek Ptolemaic queen of Egypt, and the Roman general Mark Antony, and afterwards conquered Alexandria (30 BC), the last great city of Hellenistic Greece. The Roman era of Greek history continued with Emperor Constantine the Great's adoption of Byzantium as \"Nova Roma\", the capital city of the Roman Empire; in AD 330, the city was renamed Constantinople. Afterwards, the Roman/Byzantine Empire was a generally Greek-speaking polity.\n\nThe Greek peninsula fell under Roman rule in 146 BC, after the Battle of Corinth, when Macedonia became a Roman province. At this time, southern Greece also came under Roman hegemony; however, some key Greek \"poleis\" remained partly autonomous and avoided direct Roman taxation. The Hellenistic Kingdom of Pergamon (282–133 BC) was annexed to that territory in 133 BC, when King Attalus III (r. 138–133 BC) willed the lands to Rome; however, the Romans were slow in securing their claim to those lands, and a pretender to the throne of Pergamon, Eumenes III (Aristonicus) led a revolt with the help of the philosopher Blossius, which the Roman army suppressed in 129 BC, when the lands of Pergamon were divided among Rome, the Kingdom of Pontus, and Cappadocia.\n\nIn 88 BC, Athens and other Greek city-states revolted against Rome, and were suppressed by General Lucius Cornelius Sulla. During the Roman civil wars Greece was physically and economically devastated, until Augustus organized the peninsula as the province of Achaea, in 27 BC. Initially, Rome's conquest of Greece damaged the economy, yet it readily recovered under Roman administration in the post-war period. Moreover, the Greek cities in Asia Minor recovered from Roman conquest more rapidly than did the cities of peninsular Greece, which had been much damaged in the war with Sulla. As an empire, Rome invested resources and rebuilt the cities of Roman Greece, and established Corinth as the capital city of the province of Achaea, whilst Athens prospered as a cultural hub of philosophy, education, and learned knowledge.\n\nLife in Greece continued under the Roman Empire much the same as it had previously. Roman culture was highly influenced by the Greeks; as Horace said, \"Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit\" (\"Captive Greece captured her rude conqueror\"). The epics of Homer inspired the \"Aeneid\" of Virgil, and authors such as Seneca the Younger wrote using Greek styles. While some Roman nobles regarded the Greeks as backwards and petty, many others embraced Greek literature and philosophy. The Greek language became a favorite of the educated and elite in Rome, such as Scipio Africanus, who tended to study philosophy and regarded Greek culture and science as an example to be followed.\n\nThe Roman Emperor Nero visited Greece in AD 66, and performed at the Ancient Olympic Games, despite the rules against non-Greek participation. He was honored with a victory in every contest, and in the following year he proclaimed the freedom of the Greeks at the Isthmian Games in Corinth, just as Flamininus had over 200 years previously. Hadrian was also particularly fond of the Greeks; before he became emperor he served as an eponymous archon of Athens. He also finished the Temple of Zeus there and the Athenians built the Arch of Hadrian in his honor nearby.\n\nMany temples and public buildings were built in Greece by emperors and wealthy Roman nobility, especially in Athens. Julius Caesar began construction of the Roman agora in Athens, which was finished by Augustus. The main gate, Gate of Athena Archegetis, was dedicated to the patron goddess of Athens, Athena. The Agrippeia was built in the center of the Ancient Agora of Athens by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. The emperor Hadrian was a philhellene and an ardent admirer of Greece and, seeing himself as an heir to Pericles, made many contributions to Athens. He built the Library of Hadrian in the city, as well as completing construction of the Temple of Olympian Zeus, some 638 years after its construction was started by Athenian tyrants, but ended due to the belief that building on such a scale was hubristic. The Athenians built the Arch of Hadrian to honor Emperor Hadrian. The side of the arch facing the Athenian agora and the Acropolis had an inscription stating \"This is Athens, the ancient city of Theseus.\" The side facing the Temple of Zeus and the 'new city' (this was still part of the ancient city; e.g. the Panathenaic Stadium has always been on that side) had an inscription stating \"This is the city of Hadrian, and not of Theseus.\" Adrianou (Hadrian Street) exists to this day, leading from the arch to the Ancient Agora.\n\nThe Pax Romana was the longest period of peace in Greek history, and Greece became a major crossroads of maritime trade between Rome and the Greek speaking eastern half of the empire. The Greek language served as a \"lingua franca\" in the East and in Italy, and many Greek intellectuals such as Galen would perform most of their work in Rome.\n\nDuring this time, Greece and much of the rest of the Roman east came under the influence of Early Christianity. The apostle Paul of Tarsus preached in Philippi, Corinth and Athens, and Greece soon became one of the most highly Christianized areas of the empire.\n\nDuring the 2nd and 3rd centuries, Greece was divided into provinces including Achaea, Macedonia, Epirus and Thrace. During the reign of Diocletian in the late 3rd century, Moesia was organized as a diocese, and was ruled by Galerius. Under Constantine (who professed Christianity) Greece was part of the prefectures of Macedonia and Thrace. Theodosius divided the prefecture of Macedonia into the provinces of Creta, Achaea, Thessalia, Epirus Vetus, Epirus Nova, and Macedonia. The Aegean islands formed the province of Insulae in the Diocese of Asia.\n\nGreece faced invasions from the Heruli, Goths, and Vandals during the reign of Romulus Augustulus. Stilicho, who pretended he was a regent for Arcadius, evacuated Thessaly when the Visigoths invaded in the late 4th century. Arcadius' chief advisor Eutropius allowed Alaric to enter Greece, and he looted Athens, Corinth and the Peloponnese. Stilicho eventually drove him out around 397 and Alaric was made magister militum in Illyricum. Eventually, Alaric and the Goths migrated to Italy, sacked Rome in 410, and built the Visigothic Kingdom in Iberia, which lasted until 711 with the advent of the Arabs.\n\nGreece remained part of the relatively cohesive and robust eastern half of the empire, which eventually became the center of the remaining Roman Empire, the Eastern Roman now referred to as Byzantine Empire. Contrary to outdated visions of Late Antiquity, the Greek peninsula was most likely one of the most prosperous regions of the Roman Empire. Older scenarios of poverty, depopulation, barbarian destruction, and civil decay have been revised in light of recent archaeological discoveries. In fact the polis, as an institution, appears to have remained prosperous until at least the 6th century. Contemporary texts such as Hierokles' \"Syndekmos\" affirm that late antiquity Greece was highly urbanised and contained approximately eighty cities. This view of extreme prosperity is widely accepted today, and it is assumed between the 4th and 7th centuries AD, Greece may have been one of the most economically active regions in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n\n"}

In some older texts, the resultant is also called the eliminant.\n\nThe resultant is widely used in number theory, either directly or through the discriminant, which is essentially the resultant of a polynomial and its derivative. The resultant of two polynomials with rational or polynomial coefficients may be computed efficiently on a computer. It is a basic tool of computer algebra, and is a built-in function of most computer algebra systems. It is used, among others, for cylindrical algebraic decomposition, integration of rational functions and drawing of curves defined by a bivariate polynomial equation.\n\nThe resultant of \"n\" homogeneous polynomials in \"n\" variables (also called multivariate resultant, or Macaulay's resultant for distinguishing it from the usual resultant) is a generalization, introduced by Macaulay, of the usual resultant. It is, with Gröbner bases, one of the main tools of effective elimination theory (elimination theory on computers).\n\nThe resultant of two univariate polynomials and is commonly denoted formula_1 or formula_2\n\nIn many applications of the resultant, the polynomials depend on several indeterminates and may be considered as univariate polynomials in one of their indeterminates, with polynomials in the other indeterminates as coefficients. In this case, the indeterminate that is selected for defining and computing the resultant is indicated as a subscript: formula_3 or formula_4\n\nThe degrees of the polynomials are used in the definition of the resultant. However, a polynomial of degree may also be considered as a polynomial of higher degree where the leading coefficients are zero. If such a higher degree is used for the resultant, it is usually indicated as a subscript or a superscript, such as formula_5 or formula_6\n\nThe resultant of two univariate polynomials over a field or over a commutative ring is commonly defined as the determinant of their Sylvester matrix. More precisely, let \nand\nbe nonzero polynomials of degrees and respectively. Let us denote by formula_9 the vector space (or free module if the coefficients belong to a commutative ring) of dimension \"i\" whose elements are the polynomials of degree strictly less than \"i\". The map\nsuch that \nis a linear map between two spaces of the same dimension. Over the basis of the powers of (listed in descending order), this map is represented by a square matrix of dimension , which is called the \"Sylvester matrix\" of and (for many authors and in the article Sylvester matrix, the Sylvester matrix is defined as the transpose of this matrix; this convention is not used here, as it breaks the usual convention for writing the matrix of a linear map).\n\nThe resultant of and is thus the determinant\n\nwhich has columns of and columns of (the fact that the first column of 's and the first column of 's have the same length, that is , is here only for simplifying the display of the determinant).\nFor instance, taking and we get\n\nIf the coefficients of the polynomials belong to an integral domain, then \nwhere formula_15 and formula_16 are respectively the roots, counted with their multiplicities, of and in any algebraically closed field containing the integral domain.\nThis is a straightforward consequence of the characterizing properties of the resultant that appear below. In the common case of integer coefficients, the algebraically closed field is generally chosen as the field of complex numbers.\n\nIn this section and its subsections, and are two polynomials in of respective degrees and , and their resultant is denoted \nformula_17\n\nThe resultant of two polynomials and of respective degrees and , with coefficients in \na commutative ring , has the following properties that characterize the resultant, if is a field or, more generally, an integral domain\n\n\nIn other words, the resultant is the unique function of the coefficients of two polynomials that has these properties.\n\n\nLet and be two polynomials of respective degrees and with coefficients in a commutative ring , and formula_26 a ring homomorphism of into another commutative ring . Applying formula_27 to the coefficients of a polynomial extends formula_27 to a homomorphism of polynomial rings formula_29, which is also denoted formula_30 With this notation, we have:\n\nThese properties are easily deduced from the definition of the resultant as a determinant. They are mainly used in two situations. For computing a resultant of polynomials with integer coefficients, it is generally faster to compute it modulo several primes and to retrieve the desired resultant with Chinese remainder theorem. When is a polynomial ring in other indeterminates, and is the ring obtained by specializing to numerical values some or all indeterminates of , these properties may be restated as \"if the degrees are preserved by the specialization, the resultant of the specialization of two polynomials is the specialization of the resultant\". This property is fundamental, for example, for cylindrical algebraic decomposition.\n\n\nThis means that the property of the resultant being zero is invariant under linear and projective changes of the variable.\n\n\nThese properties imply that in the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials, and all its variants (pseudo-remainder sequences), the resultant of two successive remainders (or pseudo-remainders) differs from the resultant of the initial polynomials by a factor which is easy to compute. Conversely, this allows one to deduce the resultant of the initial polynomials from the value of the last remainder or pseudo-remainder. This is the starting idea of the subresultant-pseudo-remainder-sequence algorithm, which uses the above formulae for getting subresultant polynomials as pseudo-remainders, and the resultant as the last nonzero pseudo-remainder (provided that the resultant is not zero). This algorithm works for polynomials over the integers or, more generally, over an integral domain, without any division other than exact divisions (that is, without involving fractions). It involves formula_55 arithmetic operations, while the computation of the determinant of the Sylvester matrix with standard algorithms requires formula_56 arithmetic operations.\n\nIn this section, we consider two polynomials\nand\nwhose coefficients are distinct indeterminates. Let\nbe the polynomial ring over the integers defined by these indeterminates.\nThe resultant formula_1 is often called the generic resultant for the degrees and . It has the following properties.\n\n\nThe generic resultant for the degrees and is homogeneous in various ways. More precisely:\n\nLet formula_73 be the ideal generated by two polynomials and in a polynomial ring formula_74 where is itself a polynomial ring over a field. Then:\nAn example where in the latter property is formula_79 formula_80 (the unit circle), and . In this case, formula_81 and formula_82 This example has been chosen for having a prime ideal formula_83 For another field of coefficients and another constant term in , one has also , but the ideal may be non-prime.\n\nTheoretically, the resultant could be computed by using the formula expressing it as a product of roots differences. However, as the roots may generally not be computed exactly, such an algorithm would be inefficient and numerically unstable. As the resultant is a symmetric function of the roots of each polynomial, it could also be computed by using the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, but this would be highly inefficient.\n\nAs the resultant is the determinant of the Sylvester matrix (and of the Bézout matrix), it may be computed by using any algorithm for computing determinants. This needs formula_84 arithmetic operations. As algorithms are known with a better complexity (see below), this method is not used in practice.\n\nIt follows from that the computation of a resultant is strongly related to the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials. This shows that the computation of the resultant of two polynomials of degrees and may be done in formula_55 arithmetic operations in the field of coefficients.\n\nHowever, when the coefficients are integers, rational numbers or polynomials, these arithmetic operations imply a number of GCD computations of coefficients which is of the same order and make the algorithm inefficient.\nThe subresultant pseudo-remainder sequences were introduced to solve this problem and avoid any fraction and any GCD computation of coefficients. A more efficient algorithm is obtained by using the good behavior of the resultant under a ring homomorphism on the coefficients: to compute a resultant of two polynomials with integer coefficients, one computes their resultants modulo sufficiently many prime numbers and then reconstructs the result with the Chinese remainder theorem.\n\nThe use of fast multiplication of integers and polynomials allows algorithms for resultants and greatest common divisors that have a better time complexity, which is of the order of the complexity of the multiplication, multiplied by the logarithm of the size of the input (formula_86 where is an upper bound of the number of digits of the input polynomials).\n\nResultants were introduced for solving systems of polynomial equations and provide the oldest proof that there exist algorithms for solving such systems. These are primarily intended for systems of two equations in two unknowns, but also allow solving general systems.\n\nConsider the system of two polynomial equations\nwhere and are polynomials of respective total degrees and . Then formula_88 is a polynomial in , which is generically of degree (by properties of ). A value formula_89 of is a root of if and only if either there exist formula_90 in an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients, such that formula_91, or formula_92 and formula_93 (in this case, one says that and have a common root at infinity for formula_94).\n\nTherefore, solutions to the system are obtained by computing the roots of , and for each root formula_95 computing the common root(s) of formula_96 formula_97 and formula_98\n\nBézout's theorem results from the value of formula_99, the product of the degrees of and . In fact, after a linear change of variables, one may suppose that, for each root of the resultant, there is exactly one value of such that is a common zero of and . This shows that the number of common zeros is at most the degree of the resultant, that is at most the product of the degrees of and . With some technicalities, this proof may be extended to show that, counting multiplicities and zeros at infinity, the number of zeros is exactly the product of the degrees.\n\nAt first glance, it seems that resultants may be applied to a general polynomial system of equations\nby computing the resultants of every pair formula_103 with respect to formula_104 for eliminating one unknown, and repeating the process until getting univariate polynomials. Unfortunately, this introduces many spurious solutions, which are difficult to remove.\n\nA method, introduced at the end of the 19th century, works as follows: introduce new indeterminates formula_105 and compute\nThis is a polynomial in formula_105 whose coefficients are polynomials in formula_108 which have the property that formula_109 is a common zero of these polynomial coefficients, if and only if the univariate polynomials formula_110 have a common zero, possibly at infinity. This process may be iterated until finding univariate polynomials.\n\nTo get a correct algorithm two complements have to be added to the method. Firstly, at each step, a linear change of variable may be needed in order that the degrees of the polynomials in the last variable are the same as their total degree. Secondly, if, at any step, the resultant is zero, this means that the polynomials have a common factor and that the solutions split in two components: one where the common factor is zero, and the other which is obtained by factoring out this common factor before continuing.\n\nThis algorithm is very complicated and has a huge time complexity. Therefore, its interest is mainly historical.\n\nThe discriminant of a polynomial, which is a fundamental tool in number theory is the quotient by its leading coefficient of the resultant of the polynomial and its derivative.\n\nIf formula_89 and formula_90 are algebraic numbers such that formula_113, then formula_114 is a root of the resultant formula_115 and formula_116 is a root of formula_117, where formula_118 is the degree of formula_119. Combined with the fact that formula_120 is a root of formula_121, this shows that the set of algebraic numbers is a field.\n\nLet formula_122 be an algebraic field extension generated by an element formula_95 which has formula_124 as minimal polynomial. Every element of formula_125 may be written as formula_126 where formula_127 is a polynomial. Then formula_90 is a root of formula_129 and this resultant is a power of the minimal polynomial of formula_130\n\nGiven two plane algebraic curves defined as the zeros of the polynomials and , the resultant allows the computation of their intersection. More precisely, the roots of formula_131 are the \"x\"-coordinates of the intersection points and of the common vertical asymptotes, and the roots of formula_132 are the \"y\"-coordinates of the intersection points and of the common horizontal asymptotes.\n\nA rational plane curve may be defined by a parametric equation\nwhere , and are polynomials. An implicit equation of the curve is given by\nThe \"degree\" of this curve is the highest degree of , and , which is equal to the total degree of the resultant.\n\nIn symbolic integration, for computing the antiderivative of a rational fraction, one uses partial fraction decomposition for decomposing the integral into a \"rational part\", which is a sum of rational fractions whose antiprimitives are rational fractions, and a \"logarithmic part\" which is a sum of rational fractions of the form\nwhere is a square-free polynomial and is a polynomial of lower degree than . The antiderivative of such a function involves necessarily logarithms, and generally algebraic numbers (the roots of ). In fact, the antiderivative is \nwhere the sum runs over all complex roots of .\n\nThe number of algebraic numbers involved by this expression is generally equal to the degree of , but it occurs frequently that an expression with less algebraic numbers may be computed. The Lazard–Rioboo–Trager method produced an expression, where the number of algebraic numbers is minimal, without any computation with algebraic numbers.\n\nLet \nbe the square-free factorization of the resultant which appears on the right. Trager proved that the antiderivative is \nwhere the internal sums run over the roots of the formula_139 (if formula_140 the sum is zero, as being the empty sum), and formula_141 is a polynomial of degree in . The Lazard-Rioboo contribution is the proof that formula_141 is the subresultant of degree of formula_143 and formula_144 It is thus obtained for free if the resultant is computed by the subresultant pseudo-remainder sequence.\n\nAll preceding applications, and many others, show that the resultant is a fundamental tool in computer algebra. In fact most computer algebra systems include an efficient implementation of the computation of resultants.\n\nThe resultant is also defined for two homogeneous polynomial in two indeterminates. Given two homogeneous polynomials and of respective total degrees and , their homogeneous resultant is the determinant of the matrix over the monomial basis of the linear map\nwhere runs over the bivariate homogeneous polynomials of degree , and runs over the homogeneous polynomials of degree . In other words, the homogeneous resultant of and is the resultant of \n(The capitalization of \"Res\" is used here for distinguishing the two resultants, although there is no standard rule for the capitalization of the abbreviation).\n\nThe homogeneous resultant has essentially the same properties as the usual resultant, with essentially two differences: instead of polynomial roots, one considers zeros in the projective line, and the degree of a polynomial may not change under a ring homomorphism.\nThat is:\n\nAny property of the usual resultant may similarly extended to the homogeneous resultant, and the resulting property is either very similar or simpler than the corresponding property of the usual resultant.\n\nMacaulay's resultant, named after Francis Sowerby Macaulay, also called the multivariate resultant, or the multipolynomial resultant, is a generalization of the homogeneous resultant to homogeneous polynomials in indeterminates. Macaulay's resultant is a polynomial in the coefficients of these homogeneous polynomials that vanishes if and only if the polynomials have a common non-zero solution in an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients, or, equivalently, if the hyper surfaces defined by the polynomials have a common zero in the dimensional projective space. The multivariate resultant is, with Gröbner bases, one of the main tools of effective elimination theory (elimination theory on computers).\n\nLike the homogeneous resultant, Macaulay's may be defined with determinants, and thus behaves well under ring homomorphisms. However, it cannot be defined by a single determinant. It follows that it is easier to define it first on generic polynomials.\n\nA homogeneous polynomial of degree in variables may have up to \ncoefficients; it is said to be \"generic\", if these coefficients are distinct indeterminates.\n\nLet formula_151 be generic homogeneous polynomials in indeterminates, of respective degrees formula_152 Together, they involve\nindeterminate coefficients.\nLet be the polynomial ring over the integers, in all these \nindeterminate coefficients. The polynomials formula_151 belong thus to formula_155 and their resultant (still to be defined) belongs to .\n\nThe Macaulay degree is the integer formula_156 which is fundamental in Macaulay's theory. For defining the resultant, one considers the Macaulay matrix, which is the matrix over the monomial basis of the -linear map\nin which each formula_158 runs over the homogeneous polynomials of degree formula_159 and the codomain is the -module of the homogeneous polynomials of degree .\n\nIf , the Macaulay matrix is the Sylvester matrix, and is a square matrix, but this is no longer true for . Thus, instead of considering the determinant, one considers all the maximal minors, that is the determinants of the square submatrices that have as many rows as the Macaulay matrix. Macaulay proved that the -ideal generated by these principal minors is a principal ideal, which is generated by the greatest common divisor of these minors. As one is working with polynomials with integer coefficients, this greatest common divisor is defined up its sign. The generic Macaulay resultant is the greatest common divisor which becomes , when, for each , zero is substituted for all coefficients of formula_160 except the coefficient of formula_161 for which one is substituted.\n\n\nFrom now on, we consider that the homogeneous polynomials formula_168 of degrees formula_169 have their coefficients in a field , that is that they belong to formula_170 Their resultant is defined as the element of obtained by replacing in the generic resultant the indeterminate coefficients by the actual coefficients of the formula_171\n\nThe main property of the resultant is that it is zero if only if formula_168 have a nonzero common zero in an algebraically closed extension of .\n\nThe \"only if\" part of this theorem results on the last property of the preceding paragraph, and is an effective version of Projective Nullstellensatz: If the resultant is nonzero, then\nwhere formula_174 is the Macaulay degree, and formula_175 is the maximal homogeneous ideal. This implies that formula_176 have no other common zero that the unique common zero, , of formula_177\n\nAs the computation of a resultant may be reduced to computing determinants and polynomial greatest common divisors, there are algorithms for computing resultants in a finite number of steps.\n\nHowever, the generic resultant is a polynomial of very high degree (exponential in ) depending on a huge number of indeterminates. It follows that, except for very small and very small degrees of input polynomials, the generic resultant is, in practice, impossible to compute, even with modern computers. Moreover, the number of monomials of the generic resultant is so high, that, if it would be computable, the result could not be stored on available memory devices, even for rather small values of and of the degrees of the input polynomials.\n\nTherefore, computing the resultant makes sense only for polynomials whose coefficients belong to a field or are polynomials in few indeterminates over a field.\n\nIn the case of input polynomials with coefficients in a field, the exact value of the resultant is rarely important, only its equality (or not) to zero matters. As the resultant is zero if and only if the rank of the Macaulay matrix is lower than its number of its rows, this equality to zero may by tested by applying Gaussian elimination to the Macaulay matrix. This provides a computational complexity formula_178 where is the maximum degree of input polynomials.\n\nAnother case where the computation of the resultant may provide useful information is when the coefficients of the input polynomials are polynomials in a small number of indeterminates, often called parameters. In this case, the resultant, if not zero, defines a hypersurface in the parameter space. A point belongs to this hyper surface, if and only if there are values of formula_179 which, together with the coordinates of the point are a zero of the input polynomials. In other words, the resultant is the result of the \"elimination\" of formula_179 from the input polynomials.\n\nMacaulay's resultant provides a method, called \"\"U\"-resultant\" by Macaulay, for solving systems of polynomial equations.\n\nGiven homogeneous polynomials formula_181 of degrees formula_182 in indeterminates formula_183 over a field , their \"U\"-resultant is the resultant of the polynomials formula_184 where\nis the generic linear form whose coefficients are new indeterminates formula_186 Notation formula_187 or formula_188 for these generic coefficients is traditional, and is the origin of the term \"U\"-resultant.\n\nThe \"U\"-resultant is a homogeneous polynomial in formula_189 It is zero if and only if the common zeros of formula_190 form a projective algebraic set of positive dimension (that is, there are infinitely many projective zeros over an algebraically closed extension of ). If the \"U\"-resultant is not zero, its degree is the Bézout bound formula_191\nThe \"U\"-resultant factorizes over an algebraically closed extension of into a product of linear forms. If formula_192 is such a linear factor, then formula_193 are the homogeneous coordinates of a common zero of formula_194 Moreover, every common zero may be obtained from one of these linear factors, and the multiplicity as a factor is equal to the intersection multiplicity of the formula_195 at this zero. In other words, the \"U\"-resultant provides a completely explicit version of Bézout's theorem.\n\nThe \"U\"-resultant as defined by Macaulay requires the number of homogeneous polynomials in the system of equations to be formula_196, where formula_118 is the number of indeterminates. In 1981, Daniel Lazard extended the notion to the case where the number of polynomials may differ from formula_196, and the resulting computation can be performed via a specialized Gaussian elimination procedure followed by symbolic determinant computation.\n\nLet formula_199 be homogeneous polynomials in formula_183 of degrees formula_201 over a field . Without loss of generality, one may suppose that formula_202 Setting formula_203 for , the Macaulay bound is formula_204\n\nLet formula_205 be new indeterninates and define formula_206 In this case, the Macaulay matrix is defined to be the matrix, over the basis of the monomials in formula_183 of the linear map\nwhere, for each , formula_158 runs over the linear space consisting of zero and the homogeneous polynomials of degree formula_210.\n\nReducing the Macaulay matrix by a variant of Gaussian elimination, one obtains a square matrix of linear forms in formula_186 The determinant of this matrix is the \"U\"-resultant. As with the original \"U\"-resultant, it is zero if and only if formula_199 have infinitely many common projective zeros (that is if the projective algebraic set defined by formula_199 has infinitely many points over an algebraic closure of ). Again as with the original \"U\"-resultant, when this \"U\"-resultant is not zero, it factorizes into linear factors over any algebraically closed extension of . The coefficients of these linear factors are the homogeneous coordinates of the common zeros of formula_214 and the multiplicity of a common zero equals the multiplicity of the corresponding linear factor.\n\nThe number of rows of the Macaulay matrix is less than formula_215 where is the usual mathematical constant, and is the arithmetic mean of the degrees of the formula_171 It follows that all solutions of a system of polynomial equations with a finite number of projective zeros can be determined in time formula_217 Although this bound is large, it is nearly optimal in the following sense: if all input degrees are equal, then the time complexity of the procedure is polynomial in the expected number of solutions (Bézout's theorem). This computation may be practically viable when , and are not large.\n\n\n"}

An uninhabited wildlife refuge, it is the southernmost point belonging to the United States. The land area is . The total area of the atoll, including lagoon and reef flat amounts to . Just west of the northernmost point is a channel into the lagoon, about 40 m wide. There are two islets on the northeastern rim of the reef, larger Rose Island in the east (3.5 m high) and the non-vegetated Sand Island in the north (1.5 m high).\n\nThe earliest Western sighting was June 13, 1722, during the voyage of Jacob Roggeveen, who called it \"Vuil Eiland\" \"useless island.\" The name Rose Island comes from its sighting by Louis de Freycinet in 1819. He named it after his wife Rose. While the second woman to circumnavigate the globe, Rose de Freycinet was the first to tell her tale. In his official report Louis de Freycinet records that 'I named Rose Island, from the name of someone who is extremely dear to me'. Soon afterwards, in 1824, it was seen by the expedition under Otto von Kotzebue, who named it \"Kordinkov\" after his First Lieutenant.\n\nThe Rose Atoll Marine National Monument that lies on the two outstanding islands of the Atoll is managed cooperatively between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the government of American Samoa.\n\nRose Atoll contains the largest populations of giant clams, nesting seabirds and rare reef fish in all of American Samoa. The fish population is different from the rest of the region due to a high concentration of carnivorous fish and low concentration of herbivorous fish. Almost 270 different species of fish have been recorded in the last 15 years. Tuna, mahi-mahi, billfish, barracuda and sharks reside outside the lagoon. In deeper waters, tunicates and stalked crinoids have been spotted by scuba expeditions. Sea mammals such as the endangered humpback whale and the dolphin genus \"Stenella\" also use the waters.\n\nThe atoll is a critical nesting habitat for the threatened green turtle and the endangered hawksbill turtle. The turtles migrate between American Samoa and other Pacific Island nations. Their nesting season is between the months of August and February.\n\nApproximately 97% of American Samoa's seabird population resides on Rose Atoll. Each of the 12 bird species is federally protected. Red-footed boobies and greater and lesser frigate birds nest in the buka trees. Black noddies and white terns nest in the middle and lower branches. The root system is used by reef herons and red-tailed tropic birds. Other birds can be found in the \"Pisonia\" forest, the only one left in Samoa.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2195027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195027", "title": "Cesare Prandelli", "text": "Cesare Prandelli\n\nClaudio Cesare Prandelli (; born 19 August 1957) is an Italian football coach and former player. He last managed Genoa.\n\nPrandelli was a midfielder who moved from Atalanta to Juventus in 1979. His first game for Juventus was in the 1979–80 European Cup Winners' Cup against Raba ETO Gyor. He played six seasons with Juventus, with his final game in the 1984–85 Coppa Italia against Milan.\n\nIn total, Prandelli played in 197 Serie A matches.\n\nPrandelli began his managing career as youth team coach for Atalanta, achieving excellent results from 1990 to 1997, save for a seven-months parenthesis – from November 1993 to June 1994 – in which he served as caretaker for the first team, then relegated to Serie B. After a poor 1997–98 Serie A campaign as Lecce head coach ended in a sacking in January 1998, Prandelli headed Hellas Verona for two seasons, leading the \"gialloblu\" to an immediate promotion to Serie A, and then to a solid ninth-place finish the next year. He later spent two years with Parma.\n\nStarting the 2004–05 season for Roma, he left the team because of personal problems involving his wife, with her being seriously ill.\n\nPrandelli joined Fiorentina as manager in the summer of 2005. His first season in Tuscany proved to be a huge success, as Prandelli transformed Fiorentina from relegation strugglers into a team worthy of a UEFA Champions League spot, finishing the season in fourth place. Unfortunately for Fiorentina and Prandelli, however, as a result of the \"Calciopoli\" match-fixing scandal, Fiorentina was stripped of its Champions League spot and started the 2006–07 season in Serie A with a 15-point deduction.\n\nThe next year, despite the points deduction, Prandelli was able to guide Fiorentina to a sixth-place finish in Serie A (with the same point tally as fifth placed Palermo), securing UEFA Cup qualification for the 2007–08 season. The team performed well in the competition, losing in a penalty shootout against Rangers in the semi-final. In Serie A, the team finished fourth after winning a long race against Milan, earning a ticket to participate in the 2008–09 Champions League. His wife died during the season, making Prandelli's efforts all the more impressive.\n\nFor his work in the 2007–08 season, Prandelli was awarded the Serie A Coach of the Year at the \"Oscar del calcio\" awards in early 2009. He later managed to get Fiorentina into the group phase after defeating Slavia Prague in the third qualifying round, and also guided Fiorentina to another fourth place spot, this time just pipping Genoa (who ended the season with the same points as Fiorentina, but were classified at fifth due to head-to-head results) and a second consecutive participation in the Champions League qualifying rounds. After the departure of Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti, Prandelli's tenure as Fiorentina became the longest of all incumbent Serie A managers.\n\nIn 2009, Prandelli surpassed Fulvio Bernardini as the longest-serving manager in Fiorentina history, and guided the \"viola\" to a historic qualification in the round of 16 of the 2009–10 Champions League, where it was eliminated by Bayern Munich (which later went on to reach the final) through the away goals rule. Prandelli, however, did not manage to repeat such successes at the domestic stage, with things being made even more complex by his key player Adrian Mutu being suspended due to doping-related issues. Fiorentina ended the 2009–10 Serie A in 11th position, far removed from the top sides in the league.\n\nOn 20 May 2010, Fiorentina confirmed that Prandelli was given permission to hold talks with Italian Football Federation (FIGC) president Giancarlo Abete to replace Marcello Lippi as head coach of the Italy national team after the 2010 FIFA World Cup. On 30 May, the FIGC publicly announced that Prandelli will take over from Lippi at the head of the \"Azzurri\" after the World Cup. His official debut arrived on 10 August 2010 in a friendly match against the Ivory Coast at the Boleyn Ground, London, finishing in a 0–1 defeat.\n\nThen, during the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifiers, Italy came back from behind to defeat Estonia 2–1. Italy's match against Serbia was plagued by crowd trouble and UEFA subsequently awarded Italy a 3–0 victory, putting them in pole position of their group. On 25 March 2011, Italy recorded a 1–0 win over Slovenia to secure top spot in the qualification table. Before the Slovenia game, Prandelli said, \"The moment has come for us to have faith in the former greats of our football and learn from them ... My instruction is to work, work, work and I sincerely believe in rebuilding.\" Although preparations for the Euro 2012 finals in Poland and Ukraine were affected by domestic match-rigging scandals, Prandelli succeeded in restoring honour to the national team after six years of relative famine by unexpectedly guiding it to the final. After coming second in the group stage while adopting a 3–5–2 system (with 1–1 draws against Spain and Croatia and a 2–0 win over the Republic of Ireland), the team switched to a more attractive, offensive-minded, possession-based approach, which used a 4–4–2 diamond; following the tactical switch, Italy dominated a goalless encounter against England won by a penalty shootout, and then contrived a striking 2–1 defeat of Germany in which Prandelli's special protegé Mario Balotelli scored twice. Despite losing 4–0 to Spain in the final, Prandelli was able to bring the team back to Italy amid popular applause to receive the personal compliments of President of Italy Giorgio Napolitano at an official reception in the Quirinal Palace.\n\nAfter comfortably guiding the Italian team to qualification to the 2014 World Cup, on March 2014 it was revealed Prandelli had agreed a two-year contract extension that would keep him in charge until Euro 2016. On 24 June 2014, he resigned as Italy manager after a 1–0 defeat against Uruguay which eliminated Italy from the World Cup in the group stage.\n\nOn 3 July 2014, Prandelli became the manager of Galatasaray taking over from the previous fellow Italian coach Roberto Mancini, signing a two-year contract. He would only spend 147 days as manager, however, as he was sacked on 28 November 2014. His league performance was certainly not bad: in ten weeks his team managed to get six wins, one draw and three losses, landing at third place in the Süper Lig, one point behind Fenerbahçe and Beşiktaş. The team under Prandelli, however, had one of its worst seasons in the Champions League, with two 4–1 losses to Arsenal, and 4–0 and 4–1 losses to Borussia Dortmund, ending the team with one points and −12 goal difference in six games. Prandelli's statement that \"the Turkish league is our priority\" was not well received by the fans and the club board, as Galatasaray is often seen as the \"European team\" of Turkey, being the most successful club in European tournaments. Prandelli's tactics and player choices were also heavily criticized in the media, as he tried different lineups in 16 games that he managed. His successor, Hamza Hamzaoğlu, led the team to both league and cup titles. Players declared their discontent about working with Prandelli several times in the media.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Prandelli was appointed manager of Spanish La Liga club Valencia. He resigned after only ten games on 30 December 2016.\n\nOn 25 May 2017, Prandelli was appointed manager of Emirates Arabian Gulf League club Al-Nasr Dubai.\n\nOn 7 December 2018, Prandelli was appointed as Genoa manager. His contract was terminated on 20 June 2019.\n\nPrandelli is a widower who was married to Manuela Caffi, a woman he had met in his hometown of Orzinuovi when he was 18 and she 15. They married in 1982, with footballers Antonio Cabrini and Domenico Pezzolla witnessing the event, and they had two children named Carolina and Nicolò. In 2001, Prandelli's wife was diagnosed with breast cancer; her worsening health conditions led Prandelli to resign from his coaching post at Roma only days after his signing. After a short recovery, her conditions worsened and she died on 26 November 2007 in Florence. On 29 November, Fiorentina travelled to Athens to play Greek side AEK Athens, with Prandelli's assistant Gabriele Pin deputizing for him. The Fiorentina team attended Prandelli's wife's funeral along with her personal friends. The team was shaken by the turn of events.\n\nPrandelli's son Nicolò has also embarked on an off-pitch football career, having been chosen as a fitness coach by Parma in 2009, and then by the Italy national team during the buildup to the Euro 2012 finals.\n\nPrandelli is a devout Catholic. As of 2010, he has been in a relationship with Novella Benini. Prandelli has spoken out against homophobia and racism in football; in 2012, he wrote a preface to a new book on homosexuality in sport by Alessandro Cecchi Paone and Flavio Pagano which stated, \"Homophobia is racism and it is indispensable that we make further steps to look after all aspects of individuals living their own lives, including sporting figures, ... In the world of football and of sport in general there is still a taboo around homosexuality. Everyone ought to live freely with themselves, their desires and their sentiments. We must all work for a sporting culture that respects the individual in every manifestation of his truth and freedom. Hopefully soon some players will come out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She also won the women's single titles at the French Championships and German Championships in 1931. Aussem's coach and mixed doubles partner was Bill Tilden. They won the mixed doubles title at the 1930 French Championships.\n\nAccording to A. Wallis Myers of \"The Daily Telegraph\" and the \"Daily Mail\", Aussem was ranked in the world top ten in 1928, 1930, 1931, and 1934, reaching a career high of World No. 2 in those rankings in 1930 and 1931 behind Helen Wills Moody.\n\nAussem was born in Cologne on 4 January 1909, the daughter of a wealthy salesman Johann Joseph 'Jean' Aussem and Ulrike Franziska 'Helen' Wisbaum. At the age of fourteen, she returned to Cologne after spending several years in Geneva getting a boarding school education. It was at this time that she started taking tennis lessons at the local club KTHC Stadion Rot-Weiss, driven by her mother, who was the first to notice her talent. She contacted Roman Najuch, the reigning world professional champion. Najuch referred Aussem to Willy Hanneman, a tennis coach from Cologne. Hannemann taught Aussem a great sliced backhand, a precisely placed serve, and an effective drop shot. In 1925 she won the junior singles title at the German Championships in Erfurt and was ranked nr. 6 nationally.\n\nAussem won the German Championships for the first time in 1927, when she was 18 years old. In Hamburg she defeated reigning champion Ilse Friedleben in the final in straight sets. But Aussem, who was described as a graceful, small, and psychologically sensitive girl, seemed incapable of withstanding the mental and physical pressures of competitive sports. Usually, the family traveled to exclusive places all over Europe. During the family's summer vacation at the French Riviera, Aussem's ambitious mother asked the world's best player, Bill Tilden, for advice. After having a look at small, shy, Cilly he replied: \"My dear lady, Cilly will become a great champion, if you take the next train back to Germany!\"\n\nTilden became Aussem's coach and made her a world class player. Aussem's trademark became her powerful flat forehand. Newspaper articles said that Aussem had a great sliced backhand and effective drop shots. But her biggest qualities were her precision, athletic conditioning, and fighting spirit.\n\nIn 1928 Aussem's mother claimed that Paula von Reznicek had twice beaten her daughter by using hypnotism, which led to a lawsuit in which Von Reznicek filed charges of 'defamation of character' and Aussem's mother charged her with 'insulting assault'. She lost her German Championships singles title in 1928 after a three-sets defeat in the final to Daphne Akhurst.\n\nAussem suffered from eye inflammation throughout 1929 but in 1930 she had her breakthrough. With Tilden, she won all the mixed double titles on the Riviera that season. At the French Championships, Aussem and Tilden defeated the world's top two mixed doubles teams, Elizabeth Ryan / Jean Borotra and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall / Henri Cochet, and took the French title. Aussem also reached a singles semifinal, where she lost to Helen Jacobs.\n\nAt Wimbledon, Aussem won against Jacobs in the quarterfinal and faced Ryan in a semifinal. The match ended unexpectedly. While running, Aussem tumbled, fell, twisted her ankle and lost consciousness. After that incident, health problems hampered the remainder of Aussem's tennis career. Her eyes became more and more sensitive, so that she had to spend hours in a darkened room waiting for her matches to start.\n\nIn August 1930 she won her second German Championships singles title after a straight-sets victory in the final against compatriot Hilde Krahwinkel. At the end of 1930, three years after starting to play in international championships, she reached second place in the world rankings.\n\n1931 was Aussem's most successful year. She won the French Championships, defeating Betty Nuthall of the United Kingdom, and the German Championships after a win in the final against Irmgard Rost. Aussem also won the Wimbledon singles championship, defeating her compatriot Hilde Krahwinkel in the final in straight sets. She became the first German woman to do so. Aussem again was ranked World No. 2 behind Helen Wills Moody. An English newspaper described Aussem as follows: \"There is a Paavo Nurmi of tennis from Germany, a beautiful young girl. Her quickness and her fighting spirit are singular!\"\n\nAll seemed to be prepared for a great international career when something happened that stopped Aussem's rapid rise. Celebrating the successful year of 1931, Aussem and her friend and teammate, Irmgard Rost, decided to travel to Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Aussem won some tournaments there but also caught a serious liver inflammation. Back in Germany, she underwent surgery from which she recovered only very slowly. During the two years she was not allowed to participate in sports, she dreamed about a comeback.\n\nIn 1933, Aussem returned to the courts but was not able to regain her form. In 1934, she again reached ninth place in the worldwide rankings but started losing to players she had always beaten. She lost at Wimbledon to Helen Jacobs in a quarterfinal and decided to quit the tour at age 25.\n\nDuring her winter holidays in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in 1935, Aussem met her Italian husband-to-be, Earl Fermo Murari dalla Corte Brà. The wedding took place in Munich on 11 March 1936 and the pair moved to Mombasa, Kenya. During her stay there she contracted malaria. Aussem spent the last two decades of her life mainly in her husband's castle in Portofino. Very rarely did people notice her as a discreet spectator at tennis tournaments.\n\nIn 1963, she underwent another liver surgery, a late consequence of that trip to South America three decades before. Aussem did not recover. She died on 22 March 1963, at the age of 54.\n\nGerman tennis player and writer Roderich Menzel wrote: \"Everywhere where she swang her racket and warmed the spectators hearts with her magic smile, she unknowingly inspired young girls to play tennis the way she did. If we remember her today, we feel deep love in our hearts. And we confess proudly: She was our mistress of tennis.\"\n\nSince 1965 the Junior Championships of the German Tennis Association are held under the name \"\"Grosse Cilly Aussem Spiele\"\".\n\n\n"}

The city is capital of the southeastern province of La Romana, opposite Catalina Island. The name \"Romana\" comes from a balance that was used to weigh merchandise for export. Santa Rosa de Lima is the patron saint of La Romana.\n\nThe modern La Romana International Airport was opened in 2000. The city is near several other cities, such as San Pedro de Macorís and the national capital, Santo Domingo de Guzmán. The city is a hub for a growing tourist industry with several nearby local resort spots, such as the beachfront Bayahibe, Dominicus, Casa de Campo, and the growing number of golf resorts that surround the area.\n\nThe city of La Romana was founded in 1897 as an oil town. After 1917 with the construction of a large sugar-mill (owned by Italian immigrants in the region of Rome, Lazio) the economy quickly shifted to sugar production. The commissioning of the sugar mill coincided with the rise in sugar prices worldwide, prompting the sugar industry to welcome workers from other parts of the country, many poor families from the Dominican countryside moved to La Romana in search of a better life.\n\nIn early 1960, Gulf and Western Industries, Inc. purchased the sugar mill and started to invest in the livestock industry which was cemented in the province. Meanwhile, $20 million were invested to rebuild La Romana and build schools, clinics, housing and other infrastructure for workers. During the mid-1970s the American conglomerate began selling its Dominican assets, and at the same time built what is now one of the largest exclusive tourist resorts in the Dominican Republic, Casa de Campo.\n\nCasa de Campo resort complex is the flagship of the La Romana All Inclusive Resorts area. Built in 1975 by Gulf+Western to be the premiere destination in the Caribbean, it has lived up to the hype. In 1984 Casa de Campo was purchased by the Central Romana Corporation which is co-owned by the Fanjul brothers.\nAltos de Chavón is a replica of a 16th-century Mediterranean village located just minutes from La Romana.\n\nCasa de Campo International Tourist Port (Muelle Turístico Internacional Casa de Campo), located on the West Bank of La Romana River or \"Rio Dulce\", has been utilized primarily for the docking of commercial ships, primarily for the transport of sugar and molasses. Upon exceeding the capacity of its port, the Central Romana Corporation built its new tourism focused port on the east side of the river. The platform on the western bank was renovated and the river channel was dredged to a depth of .\n\nInaugurated with the arrival of the vessel \"Costa Marina\" on December 2002, the Central Romana Corporation invested US$12 million to extend the existing port by over . The port is a modern platform and harbor terminal, with a capacity for two large modern cruise ships.\n\nToday the new facilities boast two docking platforms (East Dock: in length, West Dock: in length), a passenger terminal and parking facilities which accommodate 24 buses.\n\nLa Romana is not a typical Dominican town; instead, it is a company town, with the Central Romana Corporation owning the majority of the town. It is a town with nearly 100% employment, mostly in the tourism industry or with The Central Romana Corporation, the Duty Free Zone (Zona Franca Romana), or one of the service businesses there.\nLa Romana has been a one-company town since the South Puerto Rico Sugar Company built the mammoth Central Romana mill in 1917. It was the only sugar operation not taken over by Rafael Trujillo during his reign. From 1964 to 1967, the South Puerto Rico Sugar Company, including properties in Florida, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic became part of the conglomerate Gulf+Western. In 1984, the Gulf+Western Corporation sold their stake in the Central Romana Corporation to a group of local and foreign investors which includes the Fanjul brothers.\n\nGulf+Western acquired Consolidated Cigar in 1968 and shifted the Canary Island cigar-making operation to its Tabacalera de Garcia tobacco plant in La Romana. The Tabacalera de Garcia factory is currently one of the largest cigar factories in the world, and has been owned by the biggest cigar marketing company in the world, Altadis, since 1999. Three world-famous brands are produced in La Romana: Montecristo, H. Upmann, and Romeo y Julieta.\n\nThis town is characterized by its tremendous influence in the country's tourism programs. It's filled with beautiful beaches and many hotels and resorts. There are also many growing suburban areas and fenced communities This town has a large population, and all the problems associated with high-density areas. It does not have many notable sights in terms of architecture or urban spaces, being barely 100 years old. It grew very fast compared to the much older and slower-paced La Vega or Seibo, which are more typical Dominican towns.\n\nEstadio Francisco Micheli is home to the Toros del Este, a baseball team in the Dominican Winter League.\n\nIn 1983, the government of Salvador Jorge Blanco, through the fund for development of this region, built the \"Polideportivo de La Romana\" (La Romana Sports Center), which was named after Eleoncio Mercedes in honor of the flyweight boxer who became world champion. The Cañeros de La Romana, a Dominican basketball team, play their home games here.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2195053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195053", "title": "Baburnama", "text": "Baburnama\n\nThe Bāburnāma (Chagatai/;´, literally: \"\"History of Babur\"\" or \"\"Letters of Babur\"\"; alternatively known as \"Tuzk-e Babri\") is the memoirs of Ẓahīr-ud-Dīn Muhammad Bābur (1483–1530), founder of the Mughal Empire and a great-great-great-grandson of Timur. It is written in the Chagatai language, known to Babur as \"Turki\" (meaning \"Turkic\"), the spoken language of the Andijan-Timurids. During Emperor Akbar's reign, the work was completely translated to Persian, the usual literary language of the Mughal court, by a Mughal courtier, Abdul Rahīm, in AH 998 (1589–90). Translations into many other languages followed, mostly from the 19th century onwards. \n\nBābur was an educated Timurid prince and his observations and comments in his memoirs reflect an interest in nature, society, politics and economics. His vivid account of events covers not just his own life, but the history and geography of the areas he lived in as well as the people with whom he came into contact. The book covers topics as diverse as astronomy, geography, statecraft, military matters, weapons and battles, plants and animals, biographies and family chronicles, courtiers and artists, poetry, music and paintings, wine parties, historical monument tours as well as contemplations on human nature.\n\nThough Babur himself does not seem to have commissioned any illustrated versions, his grandson began as soon as he was presented with the finished Persian translation in November 1589. The first of four illustrated copies made under Akbar over the following decade or so was broken up for sale in 1913. Some 70 miniatures are dispersed among various collections, with 20 in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The three other versions, partly copied from the first, are in the National Museum, New Delhi (almost complete, dated 1597-98), British Library (143 out of an original 183 miniatures, probably early 1590s) with a miniature over two pages in the British Museum, and a copy, mostly lacking the text, with the largest portions in the State Museum of Eastern Cultures, Moscow (57 folios) and the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore (30 miniatures). Various other collections have isolated miniatures from these versions. Later illustrated manuscripts were also made, though not on as a grand a scale. \n\nBabur is at the centre of most scenes shown. As far is known, no contemporary images of him survive, but from whatever sources they had Akbar's artists devised a fairly consistent representation of him, \"with a roundish face and droopy moustache\", wearing a Central Asian style of turban and a short-sleeved coat over a robe with long sleeves. Coming from a period after Akbar's workshop had developed their new style of Mughal painting, the illustrated \"Baburnamas\" show developments such as landscape views with recession, influenced by Western art seen at court. Generally the scenes are less crowded than in earlier miniatures of \"historical\" scenes.\nMost images trimmed of borders\n\nAccording to historian Stephen Frederic Dale,Babur's Chagatai prose is highly Persianized in its sentence structure, morphology, and vocabulary, and also contains many phrases and smaller poems in Persian.\n\nThe \"Bāburnāma\" begins abruptly with these plain words:\n\nBābur describes his fluctuating fortunes as a minor ruler in Central Asia – he took and lost Samarkand twice – and his move to Kabul in 1504. There is a break in all known manuscripts between 1508 and 1519. Annette Beveridge and other scholars believe that the missing part in the middle, and perhaps an account of Babur's earlier childhood, a preface and perhaps an epilogue, were written but the manuscript of those parts lost by the time of Akbar. There are various points in his highly active career, and that of his son Humayun, where parts of the original manuscript might plausibly have been lost.\nBy 1519 Bābur is established in Kabul and from there launches an invasion into north-western India. The final section of the \"Bāburnāma\" covers the years 1525 to 1529 and the establishment of the Mughal empire over what was by his death still a relatively small part of north-western India, which Bābur's descendants would expand and rule for three centuries.\n\nThe account of the decisive First Battle of Panipat in 1526 is followed by long descriptions of India, its people, fauna and flora. Various exciting incidents are recounted and illustrated: Babur jumps off his horse just in time to avoid following it into a river, and when his army has formed its boats into a circle a fish jumps into a boat to escape from a crocodile.\n\nThe original Chagatai language text does not seem to have existed in many copies, and those that survive are mostly partial. The copy seen in the Mughal Library in the 1620s, and presumably used to base the Persian translation on, seems to have been lost.\n\nIt was first translated into English by John Leyden and William Erskine as \"Memoirs of Zehir-Ed-Din Muhammed Baber: Emperor of Hindustan\" and later by the British orientalist scholar Annette Beveridge.\n\nWidely translated, the \"Bāburnāma\" forms part of textbooks in no fewer than 25 countries – mostly in Central, Western, and Southern Asia. \n\nThe \"Baburnama\" fits into a tradition of imperial autobiographies or official court biographies, seen in various parts of the world. In South Asia these go back to the \"Ashokavadana\" and \"Harshacharita\" from ancient India, the medieval \"Prithviraj Raso\", and were continued by the Mughals with the \"Akbarnama\" (biography), \"Tuzk-e-Jahangiri\" or \"Jahangir-nameh\" (memoirs), and \"Shahjahannama\" (genre of flattering biographies).\n\nAkbar's ancestor Timur had been celebrated in a number of works, mostly called \"Zafarnama\" (\"Book of Victories\"), the best known of which was also produced in an illustrated copy in the 1590s by Akbar's workshop. A work purporting to be Timur's autobiography, which turned up in Jahangir's library in the 1620s, is now regarded as a fake of that period.\n\nBabur's autobiography has received widespread acclaim from modern scholars. Quoting Henry Beveridge, Stanley Lane-Poole writes:\nLane-Poole goes on to write:\nWriting about the time Babur came to India, the historian Bamber Gascoigne comments:\n\n\n"}

Invitations were issued to all players placed amongst the top 50 in the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR). Also invited were players who had, during the calendar year preceding the event, captured at least one tournament title on a sanctioning tour, or had finished the preceding season amongst the top twenty in the European Tour's Race to Dubai (the Order of Merit standings through 2008) or amongst the top five in the Order of Merit standings of any of the other three sanctioning tours.

{"id": "2195077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195077", "title": "The New Adventures of Tarzan", "text": "The New Adventures of Tarzan\n\nThe New Adventures of Tarzan is a 1935 American film serial in 12 chapters starring Herman Brix. The serial presents a more authentic version of the character than most other film adaptations, with Tarzan as a cultured and well educated gentleman as in the original Edgar Rice Burroughs novels. It was filmed during the same period as the Johnny Weissmuller/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Tarzan films. Film exhibitors had the choice of booking the serial in 12 episodes, as a feature film, also called \"The New Adventures of Tarzan\", or as the feature film followed by 11 episodes of the serial.\n\nThe serial was partly filmed in Guatemala, and Tarzan was played by Herman Brix (known post-war as Bruce Bennett). The final screenplay was credited to Charles F. Royal, and from Episode 6 onward, also Basil Dickey. It was produced by Ashton Dearholt, Bennett Cohen and George W. Stout under the corporate name of “Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises, Inc.” (which also distributed) and was directed by Edward Kull and Wilbur F. McGaugh.\n\nThe original version of the plot proposed involvement of munitions runners and government agents, focussing more on the super-explosive formula hidden in the idol. This was re-written during production but some elements remain, such as the otherwise nonsensical final chapter name \"Operator No. 17\" and Ula Vale's unexplained periodic use of disguises in the first few chapters (Ula Vale was originally written as a government agent using \"Operator No. 17\" as her codename; and this plot element was dropped from the revised script, but only after some scenes from the earlier shooting script had been filmed, along with the main title cards).\n\nSeveral plot elements bring the characters together in search (and pursuit) of the Guatemalan idol known as The Green Goddess: Tarzan's friend D'Arnot has crash landed in the region and is in the hands of a lost tribe of jungle natives; Major Martling is leading an expedition to find the fabled artefact for a powerful explosives formula hidden within it; Ula Vale's fiancé died in an earlier expedition to rescue the artefact for its archaeological benefit and so she starts one of her own in his honour; and Raglan has been sent by Hiram Powers, Ula's lawyer, to steal the valuable idol for himself. In addition to containing the explosives formula, the idol also holds a fortune in jewels.\n\nTarzan, Ula and Major Martling locate the lost city containing the idol and rescue D'Arnot from the natives that worship it in the 70-minute-long first episode. However, Raglan escapes with the Green Goddess and heads through the jungle for the coast. Tarzan and the others pursue him across the jungle, encountering many perils, including recapture by the natives to whom the idol belonged. The adventures end out at sea where, during a hurricane, they are able to permanently secure the idol while Raglan is killed by another of Powers' agents because of his failures. The murderer perishes when the ship sinks.\n\nReturning to Greystoke Manor in England with Tarzan, Ula consigns the explosives formula to fire in the final episode, where she and Tarzan also recount several adventures from the first part of the serial to an assembled party of friends and colleagues.\n\n\nIn 1929, a would-be movie entrepreneur, Ashton Dearholt, arranged an introduction to Edgar Rice Burroughs, using his wife's friendship with Burroughs' daughter. Dearholt had held several jobs within the film industry during the 1920s, and had even produced, directed and starred in a brief series of western films. As of 1929, he was familiar with Burroughs' work and wanted to get the rights to one of Burroughs' several singleton novels and film it in conjunction with RKO-Pathé. Burroughs, long dissatisfied with Hollywood's treatment of his Tarzan character, refused but took a liking to Dearholt personally and they became friends.\n\nMGM's contract with Burroughs was for just two pictures and this had run out with \"Tarzan and His Mate\". In the Summer of 1934, Dearholt and two business associates, George W. Stout, Bennett Cohen approached Burroughs to make an independent company, Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises, through which Dearholt and his partners would make films from Burroughs' works as they had been written, while Burroughs could use the business to coordinate his numerous other Tarzan-related products, organizations and franchises. Burroughs agreed, as he believed would receive a much larger amount of money than in his previous contracts with (MGM, which had made several million with their two Tarzan films despite only paying Burroughs about $75,000). Dearholt quickly outlined a story, which he called \"Tarzan and the Green Goddess\", based on which Charles F. Royal and Edwin Blum then wrote the screen treatment, renaming it \"Tarzan in Guatemala\". as Guatemala had been chosen by Dearholt as the film's location. He had visited that country in 1933 as a trouble-shooter for RKO Pictures and felt that he knew enough about the country, had the contacts there including within the government, and could make the film far more economically than in Hollywood. Therefore, in late 1934, Dearholt \"led an expedition\" of 29 cast and crew, with several tons of freight, aboard the liner \"Seattle\" to begin filming in highland ruins in Guatemala. The expedition almost never got started, however, as Dearholt's personal credit would not support the loan he estimated as needed to make the picture. Burroughs had to reluctantly involve himself as co-signatory and the loan was approved the day before the party was due to sail.\n\nFar from being the low-cost, exotically-located, adventurous film-making experience Dearholt anticipated, this decision caused unusual production problems. When the cast and crew arrived in Guatemala there was no harbour so they had to be shuttled ashore by boats across three miles of sea during a storm. Once there, they were held up by customs and security officers of President Jorge Ubico, whose assistance Dearholt had counted on and even had him written into the serial's final episode as a character (whether he intended to ask the Presidente to play himself is not known). Once ashore, the party was housed in a hotel with no in-room plumbing, having to use outhouses \"stacked\" alongside each story of the structure.\n\nIt then took 18 hours to travel the 100 miles to Chichicastenango, on a plateau 6,447 ft above sea level. The production then moved on to Lake Atitlán, Tikal, and to Guatemala City. Guatemala had no motion picture industry of its own, so everywhere they went, the company had to carry tons of equipment brought with them from the States, including an enormous sound truck which was not designed for the winding, dirt mountain highways which made up most of the country's transit infrastructure. Tropical diseases abounded and apparently every cast member was stricken at least once and laid up, unable to work, for weeks. The local wildlife was also a problem. According to an interview with Herman Brix in the \"Christian Science Monitor\" (1999), \"there was only a single sharpshooter up in the trees to keep the croc away from me.\" The local climate became another problem when the production was affected by tropical storms and some film was damaged by the humid environment of the very real jungle.\n\nThe loan obtained in California was used up long before the picture was finished, and the expedition evidently had to waste additional time hiding from local creditors and the police in the jungles before returning to California, where the picture was finished. Nevertheless, the film was finished in four months, with the title changed again to \"The New Adventures of Tarzan\".\n\nIn spite of the difficulties faced while filming in the jungles, most of the places visited by the filming crew and actors were served by the American company International Railways of Central America (IRCA). In 1935, the railroad service in Guatemala was at its peak, controlled by the American IRCA, and had major stations at Puerto San José, Guatemala City and Puerto Barrios, which allowed the crew to transport their equipment easily to these locations. The only difficult locations to reach were Chichicastenango and Tikal, since there were no IRCA services available to those places, although there was airline service to Peten available.\n\nThe places where the filming took place were:\n\n\nScenes were also shot at Jungleland USA in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\nWhile in Guatemala in 1933 troubleshooting for RKO, Ashton Dearholt met and fell in love with the young swimmer whom he hired as the serial's lead actress. She was named Florence Watson, but he rechristened her Ula Holt. He brought her back to Los Angeles with him and installed her in the Dearholt household. Dearholt's wife, Florence Gilbert, left with their two children, and eventually filed for divorce shortly before the expedition's departure. While filming, Edgar Rice Burroughs divorced his wife Emma Hubert and married Florence Gilbert, 30-years his junior, on 4 April 1935, after which they escaped to Hawaii for their honeymoon. He would write in his personal diary that he had fallen in love with Florence when she accompanied Dearholt to his first meeting with Burroughs in 1929.\n\nBurroughs decided that he needed immediate money and that Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises was not going to make it for him after all. He re-optioned MGM's contract for a third Weissmuller film and approved the sale of three of Sol Lesser's remaining four options to MGM, who agreed to make a large \"authorisation payment\" to Burroughs. (Sol Lesser had acquired options for five Tarzan productions from a defunct company, the first of which he used to make \"Tarzan the Fearless\" in direct competition with MGM's films.) MGM paid Lesser $500,000 for his options and paid Burroughs $25–50,000 per film.\n\nMost modern reference sources allege that MGM campaigned to undermine their new film rival by threatening that theaters showing the Dearholt serial would not be allowed to show the third MGM film when it was released. However, no reference to such a campaign can be found in any primary contemporary resources, including Variety, The Film Daily, The Motion Picture Exhibitor or even the New York Times, all of which reviewed the film and covered its filming progress; and modern sources, which have relied heavily on pressbook material and rank assumptions by each other for other aspects of the serial's \"history\", do not provide any reference source for this allegation.\n\nBurroughs-Tarzan Enterprises tried to make its serial more lucrative by releasing it in two different formats. The first involved having the first episode with a 65-minute running time and encouraging theater owners to book it as the \"feature\" film on a program with the last episode of a previous serial, with the remaining eleven episodes to follow; and the second was by creating a 70-minute feature film from the first episode and its cliffhanger resolution in the second chapter, plus a brief sequence showing the capture of Raglan, which could either be booked also as a longer first episode (to be followed by the remaining eleven) or as a stand-alone feature. Reports of use of yet another first episode being cut and played against seven subsequent episodes cannot be verified. In any event this plan was not successful in the USA. \"New Adventures of Tarzan\" was the last Tarzan serial ever produced. However the serial did much better abroad, especially in England, where it was re-released following World War II with its first episode shortened to 45 minutes, and its two feature versions also edited, all at the hands of E. J. Fancey's New Realm Pictures, Ltd. These truncated versions later became staples of U.S. television and even later videotape and DVA printings, to the extent that the original editions may be considered lost, at least to the general public: even the \"restored\" version issued in 2019 on DVD by The Roan Group has only the abridged first episode. Only one Beta videotape of the serial, marketed in the 1980s by Nostalgia Family Merchant, is known to have included the complete first episode.\n\nFancey also dubbed, or re-dubbed, the first feature version, the poor quality of which he excused by adding an \"apology\" to the credits which claimed the problem was due to \"variable atmospheric conditions\" in Guatemala which had affected the original recording: in fact, the original release material contain no such apology and prints made from the original material have an adequate sound track.\n\nThis serial features an alternate version of the famous Tarzan yell. This version is variously described as a rising pitch \"Man-gan-i\" or \"Tar-man-gan-i\" sound. The \"Tar-man-gan-i\" version originally comes from the 1932 Tarzan radio serial starring James Pierce. In the ape language used in the Burroughs' Tarzan novels, \"Tarmangani\" means \"Great White Ape\". MGM's Johnny Weissmuller films, featuring the now standard yell, had been in production for some time when this serial was created, starting with \"Tarzan the Ape Man\" (1932).The original version of the plot involved munitions runners and government agents, focussing more on the super-explosive formula hidden in the idol. This was re-written during production but some elements remain, such as the otherwise nonsensical final chapter name \"Operator No. 17\" (Ula Vale was originally written as a government agent using \"Operator No. 17\" as her codename but this entire plot line was dropped from the final script).\n\nBrix performed his own stunts in the serial, including swinging from real jungle vines, but this presented further problems. Despite testing a vine for safety beforehand with a 200 lb weight, when Brix tried himself, with a run up, he over shot the pool of water he was meant to land in. \"I still have the scars from that fall,\" he told the Monitor. The scene where Brix bursts the ropes binding him is real.\n\nReviews in the United States were poor. There may have been suspicions that this was due to MGM's influence over the trade media, but with the low budget, major financial difficulties, and problems with the Guatemalan government while on location, it may just have been its fate as an independent picture. \"Variety\", for example, said that \"limpid direction makes it fall way short of even the limited possibilities of an independent production.\" The \"Motion Picture Herald\", however, described is as \"spectacular and authentic.\" The film was more of a success outside the United States, possibly due to MGM's lack of control in those markets. According to Gabe Essoe, \"on the strength of the one picture alone, Brix became twentieth in popularity in France and Britain.\"\n\nDespite its problems, the film was successful enough that a second feature film, \"Tarzan and the Green Goddess\", was released in 1938. It was based on footage from the last ten chapters of the serial, with some minor additions, and follows much the same plot. William C. Cline believes \"The New Adventures of Tarzan\" to be the best of the Tarzan serials.\n\n\nN.B. Most of these references emanate from the Tarzan film and serials fan communities, and are largely based on pressbook material, each other, and, less often, viewings of one or both of the Fancey-edited feature versions of serial without also viewing the serial itself, and should be taken as of questionable reliability in re this title.\n\n"}
{"id": "2195079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195079", "title": "Greek cruiser Georgios Averof", "text": "Greek cruiser Georgios Averof\n\nGeorgios Averof () is a modified armored cruiser built in Italy for the Royal Hellenic Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. The ship served as the Greek flagship during most of the first half of the century. Although popularly known as a battleship (θωρηκτό) in Greek, she is in fact an armored cruiser (θωρακισμένο καταδρομικό), the only ship of this type still in existence.\n\nThe ship was initially ordered by the Italian Regia Marina, but budgetary constraints led Italy to offer it for sale to international customers. With the bequest of the wealthy benefactor George Averoff as down payment, Greece acquired the ship in 1909. Launched in 1910, \"Averof\" arrived in Greece in September 1911. The most modern warship in the Aegean at the time, she served as the flagship of admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis in the First Balkan War, and played a major role in the establishment of Greek predominance over the Ottoman Navy and the incorporation of many Aegean islands to Greece.\n\nThe ship continued to serve in World War I, the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, and the interwar period, receiving a modernization in France in 1925 to 1927. Following the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, \"Averof\" participated in the exodus of the Greek fleet to Egypt. Hopelessly obsolete and prone to mechanical breakdowns, she nevertheless spent the next three years as a convoy escort and guard ship in the Indian Ocean and at the Suez Canal. In October 1944, she carried the Greek government in exile back to liberated Athens, after the withdrawal of the German army.\n\nIn 1952, she was decommissioned, before being moved to Poros, where she was berthed from 1956 to 1983. From 1984 until today, she has been reinstated on active duty as museum ship in the Naval Tradition Park in Faliro. After maintenance in late 2017, she achieved seaworthiness state once again, allowing the ship to sail (towed) accompanied by Greek frigate \"Kountouriotis\" (F-462) (Φ/Γ Κουντουριώτης) to Thessaloniki Greece where she received more than 130,000 visitors over her 53-day stay.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Greece decided to reinforce its fleet, whose ships were fast becoming obsolete due to the rapidly advancing naval technology of the era. The navy procured eight destroyers (then a relatively new type of ship) between 1905–1907, but the most important addition was the armored cruiser \"Georgios Averof\". Like her Italian sisters and , she was being built at Orlando Shipyards, Livorno, Italy. When the Italian government cancelled the third ship of the class due to budgetary concerns, the Greek government immediately stepped in and bought her with a one-third downpayment (ca. 300,000 gold pound sterling), the bequest of a wealthy Greek benefactor, Georgios Averof, whose name she consequently received.\n\nThe \"Averof\" was fitted with a combination of Italian engines, French boilers, British guns, and German generators. The most discernible difference between the cruiser and her Italian sisters was the shape of her six gun turrets. The \"Averof\" encased her British-built guns in rounded pillbox-form housings with convex roof plates. She was also fitted with a foremast, which her sister-ships did not receive until after the start of the First World War. Such was the urgency of the Greek Navy to see the ship in service, that they accepted her with a gouge inside one of the gun barrels. This had been caused by the slip of a rifling tool, but Armstrong Whitworth's chief ordnance engineer correctly judged the defect as inconsequential to the weapon's performance and safety.\n\nThe \"Averof\" was launched on 12 March 1910. She would be the last commissioned armored cruiser in the world, a class of warship that had already been rendered obsolete by the battlecruiser. Her first captain, Ioannis Damianos, took command on 16 May 1911, and the \"Averof\" immediately sailed to England for the Coronation Naval Review of King George V. While there, she would also receive the first load of ammunition for her British-built guns. The stay in England was troubled by running aground at Spithead on 19 June, which forced her into drydock. While waiting for repairs, her crew was involved in a large brawl with the locals, caused by their unfamiliarity with the mould found on edible blue cheese. Captain Damianos was deemed inadequate to maintain discipline, and replaced by the esteemed taskmaster, Pavlos Kountouriotis. During the journey home, Captain Kountouriotis thoroughly trained his crew, with the exception of gunnery practice, as ammunition was limited to special deliveries from Britain. The \"Averof\" finally reached Faliro Bay, near Athens, on 1 September 1911. At that time, she was the most modern and powerful warship in the navies of the Balkan League or the Ottoman Empire.\n\nWith the outbreak of the First Balkan War in October 1912, Kountouriotis was named rear admiral and commander-in-chief of the Hellenic Royal Navy. \"Averof\", under Captain Sofoklis Dousmanis, served as the flagship of the fleet, and she took part in the takeover of the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean. During the naval battles at Elli (3 December 1912) and Lemnos (5 January 1913) against the Ottoman Navy, she almost single-handedly secured victory and the undisputed control of the Aegean Sea for Greece. In both battles, due to her superior speed, armor and armament, she left the battle line and pursued the Turkish Fleet alone. During the Battle of Elli, Kountouriotis, frustrated by the slow speed of the three older Greek battleships, hoisted the Flag Signal for the letter \"Z\" which stood for \"Independent Action\", and sailed forward alone, with a speed of against the Turkish fleet. \"Averof\" succeeded in crossing the T of the Turkish fleet and concentrated her fire against the Ottoman flagship, thus forcing the Ottoman fleet to retreat in disorder. Likewise, during the Battle of Lemnos, when the older battleships failed to follow up with \"Averof\", Kountouriotis did not hesitate to pursue independent action.\n\nIn each battle the ship suffered only slight damage, while inflicting severe damage to several Turkish ships. These exploits propelled her and her Admiral to legendary status in Greece. After the Battle of Lemnos, the crew of \"Averof\" affectionately nicknamed her \"Lucky Uncle George\". It is a notable fact that, due to the aforementioned need to conserve ammunition which had to be secured from Britain, \"Averof\" fired her guns for the first time during the Battle of Elli.\n\n\"Georgios Averof\" is credited with successfully closing the Aegean Sea to Ottoman transports bringing fresh troops and supplies to the front during the First Balkan War. This success had a concrete impact on the land action where the Ottoman forces suffered decisive defeats. It is hypothesized that in the lack of such decisive control of the sea by the Greek Navy, the Ottoman Empire might have reinforced its forces on the Balkan Peninsula and therefore fared better in the war.\n\nDuring World War I, \"Averof\" did not see much active service, as Greece was neutral during the first years of the war, and in deep internal turmoil (see National Schism). After the \"Noemvriana\" riots of 1916, she was seized by the French, and only returned after Greece formally entered the war on the side of the Allies in June 1917. After the armistice, \"Averof\" sailed with other Allied warships to Constantinople, where she received an ecstatic welcome from the city's many Greeks. Under Rear Admiral Ioannis Ipitis, the cruiser continued to serve as flagship of the Royal Hellenic Navy. During the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), she supported troop landings in Eastern Thrace, bombarded the Turkish Black Sea coastline, and helped to evacuate refugees after the Greek Army's defeat.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1927, the cruiser underwent a major refit in France, during which she received modern anti-aircraft armament, a new tripod-foremast and conning tower, improved fire-control equipment, and an overhaul of her engines, boilers, and furnaces. The ship's obsolete 17-inch torpedo tubes were also removed. Given her age, the cost of converting the vessel to fuel-oil firing was considered prohibitive. On 20 May 1937, \"Averof\" joined the warships of fourteen other nations at the \"Coronation Naval Review\" in Spithead, England. She was the only one of the 150 vessels present which had also attended the previous coronation review in 1911. King George VI was reminded of the fact, as he warmly welcomed \"Averof\"s captain, during the preliminary introduction of Britain's naval guests.\n\nIn the early morning of 18 April 1941, after the collapse of the Greco-German front, the \"Averof\"s crew disobeyed direct orders to scuttle the ship in preventing her possible capture by the enemy. They cut through a closed harbor-boom with axes and handsaws to let the vessel escape, and their commanding officer dramatically embarked up a rope ladder to join them as the vessel was underway. Under the constant threat of Luftwaffe air strikes (which had sunk many Greek and British warships during the evacuation), the cruiser sailed to Souda Bay, Crete. Then on to the UK naval station at Alexandria, arriving in Egypt on 23 April.\nWhile too slow to serve with the British Fleet in the Mediterranean, and also lacking sufficient anti-aircraft armament for that theatre of operation, the old armored cruiser was considered quite appropriate for escorting Indian Ocean convoys. In this capacity, she could offer more firepower than a contemporary heavy cruiser (albeit with less gunnery range), and twice their respective armour protection, quite sufficient to deal with the threat posed by German raiders operating in the sector. This task also required no more speed than her then greatly reduced maximum of 12 knots. So from September 1941 through October 1942, under British control, she was assigned to convoy escort and patrol duties in the Indian Ocean and based at Bombay.\n\nThe \"Averof\" left Alexandria on 30 June and passed through the Suez Canal to Port Tewfiq (Port Suez). The three weeks spent there saw her crew involved in the rescue of sailors and soldiers aboard the Cunard Line troopship MV \"Georgic\", which was set ablaze and sunk at an adjacent berth during a Luftwaffe air raid on 6 July. With several of her boilers deactivated, and the fuel-oil spraying mechanism for her coal furnaces now inoperable, the \"Averof\" was then capable of only 9 knots, insufficient for her planned convoy duties. So on 20 July, the ship departed for Port Sudan, where she underwent three weeks of emergency repairs to her oil-accelerant apparatus, raising her cruising speed to the required minimum. The vessel then resumed her passage of the Red Sea and reached the port of Aden, in late-August. From there, she sailed in an unassigned convoy crossing of the Indian Ocean, arriving at Bombay on 10 September 1941.\n\nAs the \"Averof\" had not seen an overhaul of her boilers and furnaces since 1926, mechanical problems continued to plague the vessel and ultimately cut short her usefulness in convoy service. On 28 September she was assigned to escort an oil tanker convoy (BP.16) from Bombay to Basra in the Persian Gulf, but was detached before completing the voyage due to faulty boilers. This was of extra concern because on 24 September, the German auxiliary cruiser \"Kormoran\" had sunk the \"Stamatios G. Embiricos\" at the equator, ending three months of raider inactivity in the sector. By the time the \"Averof\" was forced to leave her convoy, the Greek freighter was already four days overdue to Columbo, Ceylon, meaning the enemy would have had a week to sail in any direction from the \"Embiricos\"' last known position. However, the \"Kormoran\" had moved southeast towards Australia (and her fateful meeting with HMAS \"Sydney\"), and convoy BP.16 reached Basra safely on 5 October. The \"Averof\" returned to Bombay on 4 October, where the cruiser underwent emergency repairs. On 20 December, she finally sailed again from Bombay to “cover” a troop-support convoy (BM.31B) headed for Singapore with a stop at Columbo. Here she was detached, returning to Bombay on 5 January 1942.\n\nOn 9 January the \"Averof\" again put to sea in advance of the unescorted departures of six troopships from Bombay and Karachi, headed for Basra (BP.31A – 31B). The cruiser could not hope to keep up with these vessels, traveling at 14 to 16 knots, so she was once again designated as a patrol vessel (“defensive cover”) for the sea lane in which they would eventually overtake her. Turning in the Gulf of Oman, the \"Averof\"s lookout spotted a modern freighter appearing to shadow the warship at a safe distance. The cruiser went to “battle stations” over the possible sighting of a merchant raider, but the suspicious vessel altered course and sped away.\n\nThis incident appears to have prompted a call for gunnery practice after the ship returned to Bombay on 15 January. During these exercises in the bay outside the harbor, the recoil from one of the \"Averof\"s eight-gun broadsides fractured the mounts on two of her active boilers and sent them crashing to the deck. The vessel limped into port for major repairs and did not venture out again until she departed Bombay in early November 1942. By then, she had been dubbed, “Georgios Never-off”, by the base’s Royal Navy personnel. Again repaired to a cruising capability of 12 knots, she sailed for Port Said, Egypt, in an independent passage of the Arabian and Red Seas, and took up duties as a Suez Canal guard ship from mid-November 1942.\n\n\"Averof\" was the only World War I-era armored cruiser to serve in her original capacity during World War II (several old Japanese vessels of the type acted as training ships, or were converted for minelaying). While her 9.2-inch British-built ordnance was no longer in sea service with the Royal Navy, many of these weapons had been moved to coastal batteries and their shells were readily available. The British 7.5-inch naval gun was still employed on three of the Royal Navy's \"Hawkins\"-class heavy cruisers, as well as shore installations, so its ammunition also remained in production. However, this was not to prove a factor in \"Averof\"s viability, as she was never again required to fire her guns in anger.\n\nOn 17 October 1944, once again as the flagship of the exiled Hellenic Navy, and under the command of Captain Theodoros Koundouriotis (the Admiral's son), she carried the Greek government-in-exile from Cairo to liberated Athens. \"Averof\" continued as Fleet Headquarters until she was decommissioned in 1952. Afterward, the vessel remained anchored at Salamis until she was towed to Poros, where she was berthed from 1956 to 1983.\n\nIn 1984 the Navy decided to restore her as a museum ship, and in the same year she was towed to Palaio Faliro, where she is anchored as a functioning floating museum, seeking to promote the historical consolidation and upkeep of the Greek naval tradition. Free guided tours are provided to visiting schools and on holidays. In 2016 she has been retrofitted with an internal elevator allowing access to most decks by visitors with movement disabilities. She is berthed at Trocadero quay, as part of the Naval Tradition Park.\n\nThe ship is crewed and regarded as in active service, carrying the Rear Admiral's rank flag a square blue flag with white cross, like the Greek jack, with two white stars in each of the two squares on the flagstaff side atop the mainmast with the masthead pennant (a long triangular blue flag with a white orthogonal Greek cross) displaced downward. Every Hellenic Navy ship entering or sailing in Faliro Bay honours \"Averof\" while passing. The crew are ordered to attention (with the \"Still to\" order) and from the relevant boatswain's pipe (or bugle call) every man on decks stands to attention, officers saluting, looking to the side where \"Averof\" is in sight until \"Continue\" is ordered.\n\nIn June 2010 the ship was involved in a scandal after being used as the stage for a lavish wedding party by Greek shipowner Leo Patitsas and TV persona Marietta Chrousala. The publication of photos from the party by the \"Proto Thema\" tabloid caused major political uproar, resulting in the dismissal of her commander, Commodore Evangelos Gavalas.\n\nOn 26 April 2017, the \"Averof\" was towed from her museum dock at Palaio Faliro to the Skaramangas Shipyard, in Elefsis. Two commercial tugs and a pilot craft maneuvered the cruiser under the command of the Commodore Sotirios Charalampopoulos. A Greek Navy tug and a helicopter also assisted the operation. At the shipyard, the \"Averof\" underwent two months of maintenance and repairs, partially funded by Greek shipping magnate and philanthropist, Alexandros Goulandris. In May 2017, Goulandris, together with \"Hydra Ecologists Club\", and several retired Hellenic Navy officers, announced their intention to begin a thorough review of the mechanical parts that would need to be newly machined or refurbished, so that the ship might eventually sail the Aegean under steam power. If realised, it would make the \"Averof\" the oldest operational steel warship in the world. Goulandris died on 25 May 2017, three weeks after the announcement.\n\nThe cruiser's two months of dry dock inspection and hull maintenance were a prelude to the vessel's first voyage in 72 years. On 5 October 2017, the \"Averof\" left her long-time berth at Palaio Faliro, and was towed 250 miles across the open sea to a 50-day exhibition-docking on Thessaloniki's urban waterfront. The vessel was escorted by up to six large tugs and a pilot craft from \"Zouros Salvage & Towage\". A Hellenic Navy tugboat also accompanied them. On 7 October, the group approached the Thessaloniki dock with horns and sirens blaring, their fire-fighting nozzles shooting great plumes of water skywards. An honor guard of Greek sailors and a Hellenic Navy band were arrayed along the dock to meet the ship. After 7 weeks of heavy visitation (over 130,000 visitors in 53 days) by the general public, the \"Averof\" returned to her Palaio Faliro museum dock on 13 December.\n\n\n"}

It stars Skeet Ulrich, Natasha Henstridge, Leslie Nielsen, and Rik Mayall and is about an Alaskan Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in which Kevin Manley, whose grandfather has passed on and now must participate in the state's Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in order to prove he's worthy enough for his grandfather's estate. The film was released to DVD in the United States with the alternate title of \"Chilly Dogs\" on February 4, 2003.\n\nKevin Manley (Skeet Ulrich), a Los Angeles travel agent, receives the message that his grandpa has passed and left everything to him. However, he must go to Alaska in order to collect his inheritance. He leaves Canoga Park (Los Angeles), quits his job, despite his boss warning him that he will give up and decide to come back begging for his job back, and heads to Anchorage, Alaska.\n\nUpon arrival, Manley finds out that if he proves he is manly by participating in the yearly Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race he can obtain the land that his grandfather left to him and if he doesn't participate, the land wouldn't be signed over.\n\nWhile in Alaska, he meets some other participants including: the beautiful Bonnie Livengood (Natasha Henstridge), the stupid English Carter (Rik Mayall), ex-sheriff Ned Parker (Lochlyn Munro) and the local attorney Clive Thornton (Leslie Nielsen) who initially informed him of conditions of the race.\n\nManley eventually discovers a box of various items that had belonged to his grandfather that included a fur cap and coat, a sword, and a diary which informed Manley that his grandfather had found gold on the land with a relative of a participant he had met earlier, Bonnie Livengood.\n\nWhile preparing for the event, two other participants, Clive and Carter, attempt to sabotage Manley's chances at winning the race so they can get the land and the gold. Clive promises to pay Carter a thousand dollars if he could prevent Kevin from entering or even finishing the race. Carter succeeds in stealing Kevin's team of huskies and burning down the shed containing his sled, tent, and supplies.\n\nDespite his losses, Kevin uses some of his remaining savings to buy a new sled, a tent, some winter clothing, and food supplies for him and his dogs. He also buys a new team of dogs to replace the ones he lost: Farty, a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, Trooper, a German Shepherd, Pierre, a black poodle, Barker, a large dark-brown wiry-haired mongrel, Gumly, a large St. Bernard, Snowflake, a white American bulldog, and a Jack Russell terrier named Riddles.\n\nAfter the Iditarod race begins and the teams head off into the wilderness, Kevin begins to learn how to survive on the trail and face the perils that seem to pull on him. He and his dogs begin to form a bond of friendship. Along the trail, Kevin rescues Bonnie from Parker, who was in the process of trying to rape her, and gives him the \"Canoga Park Coffee Zap\", in which he pours hot coffee on his private area. Shortly afterwards, Bonnie and Kevin form a deep relationship and fall in love with each other.\n\nClive and Carter, who are both anxious to have Kevin lose, try several plans to stop Kevin from finishing the race. Carter cuts half of one of the lines attached to the sled, in which it snaps free as the team rush on down the trail and Kevin has an accident, but is rescued by an Indian tribe and nursed back to health. Another night, Clive and Carter scatter strips of meat around the camp, which attracts a grizzly bear that tears down Kevin's tent and scares him and his dogs off. After the duo blow up Kevin's grandfather's cabin with dynamite, Kevin soon finds out of Clive's and Carter's plan and warn them both to stay away from him and his team.\n\nWhile camping in a snow cave during a blizzard, Bonnie and Kevin discover a map inside Kevin's jacket that belonged to his grandfather. The map tells them of a place known as Wolf Mountain, where Kevin believes that his grandfather hid his gold. When the storm clears, they reach Wolf Mountain and recovered the chest full of gold nuggets underneath the snow.\n\nUnfortunately, Clive and Carter arrive, take the chest of gold, and take Bonnie hostage after burying Kevin in the spot where they uncovered the gold. However, Kevin orders his lead dog, Farty to dig him out and he follows Clive and Bonnie all the way to Nome, which is the finish line of the Iditarod Sled Dog race. He manages to beat Parker and Carter, wins the race, and races onward to cut off Thornton's escape. He rescues Bonnie and Clive draws out a gun and fires at them, but he misses. The bullet glances off several metal objects inside an abandoned garage and finally hits an oil barrel, which blows up the garage with Clive inside it. At the same moment, the gold survives the explosion and falls around Bonnie and Kevin, who are surprised and overjoyed.\n\nClive, who had recently survived the explosion, and Carter are arrested for their actions against Kevin and Bonnie, and Kevin is rewarded with the prize money of the race, a gold cup, and a bouquet of flowers, which he gives to Bonnie. He asks Bonnie to marry him and she happily agrees. With some of the prize money and his grandfather's gold, Bonnie and Kevin get married, build a new cabin, and settle down with their dogs and their first child, a baby girl.\n\n\n"}

Its first game premiered in Japan in 1987, and \"Final Fantasy\" games have subsequently been localized for markets in North America, Europe and Australia, on nearly every video game console since its debut on the Nintendo Entertainment System. \"Final Fantasy\" is Square Enix's most successful franchise, having sold over 97 million units worldwide to date. In addition to traditional role-playing games, the series includes tactical role-playing games, portable games, massively multiplayer online role-playing games, and games for mobile phones. Its popularity has placed it as the sixth-best-selling video game franchise, and the series has won multiple awards over the years.\n\nIn addition to the 15 games released as part of the main (numbered) series and their many spin-offs and related titles, the \"Final Fantasy\" series has spawned many works in other media including anime, movies, novels and manga, and radio dramas. \"\", originally a stand-alone anime series, now has its own sub-franchise which includes video games. Many games, particularly the main series, have soundtrack album releases featuring their music in different arrangements. Square Enix has also consistently released companion books for its games which provide additional backstory and plot information, as well as detailed walkthroughs for the game. Since the announcement of \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\", Square Enix has focused on \"polymorphic content\", expanding each game world with material on many video game platforms, as well as other forms of media.\n\nEach game in the main series takes place in a different fictional universe, although beginning with \"Final Fantasy X-2\", additional video games set in the main series games' worlds have been released. \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\" and \"Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy\" are cross-platform multimedia projects consisting of games, films, books, and other media centered on their respective main series game, \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"Final Fantasy XIII\". \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", although originally envisioned as a spin-off game, became its own series as part of \"Ivalice Alliance\", which counts \"Final Fantasy XII\" in its membership.\n\nA large number of spin-off video games have also been made for the \"Final Fantasy\" series. These spin-off games vary in their relation to the main series; the first, \"The Final Fantasy Legend\" games, were marketed as related in North America but were considered to be the first three games of the \"SaGa series\" in their native Japan, and later \"SaGa\" games released outside Japan bear no \"Final Fantasy\" branding. \"Dissidia Final Fantasy\", on the other hand, is a fighting game using characters from the main series exclusively. Overall, more than 30 games have been released as spin-offs of the main \"Final Fantasy\" series, many within their own sub-series.\n\nSquare's initial forays into film and television were critical and commercial failures. \"\" was poorly received and the box office failure of \"\" lead to the merger between Square and Enix. The series did not have success in film until \"\", which ultimately won several awards for \"best anime feature\" and sold over 2.4 million copies within a year.\n\nDespite its decline in the United States, radio drama has remained popular in Japan. The series features a small number of radio drama releases.\n\nThe primary composer of music for the main series was Nobuo Uematsu, who single-handedly composed the soundtracks for the first nine games, as well as directed the production of many of the albums. Music for the spin-off series and main series games beginning with \"Final Fantasy X\" was created by a variety of composers including Masashi Hamauzu, Naoshi Mizuta, Hitoshi Sakimoto, and Kumi Tanioka, as well as many others. In addition to the original soundtracks, listed below, many games have inspired orchestral, vocal, or piano arrangement albums, as well as compilation albums featuring music from several \"Final Fantasy\" games.\n\nStarting with \"Final Fantasy III\", Square began publishing guide books for its games which traditionally include additional content such as developer interviews and expanded plot and setting information. Studio BentStuff wrote the first \"Ultimania\" book for \"Final Fantasy VIII\" in 1999, though the company had been contracted to write \"Final Fantasy VII True Script Dissection\" for the previous game. Since then, \"Ultimania\" books have been written for every major \"Final Fantasy\" title, including \"Battle Ultimania\", \"Scenario Ultimania\", and \"Ultimania Omega\" editions for some games. Square experimented with online content delivery with \"Final Fantasy IX Online Ultimania\", but the move was criticized for forcing customers to buy a print guide while releasing most of the information online. Another online \"Ultimania\" was planned for \"Final Fantasy XI\", but it was dropped during development. Square Enix has produced expanded editions to some books, such as \"Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania Revised Edition\". In addition to the \"Ultimania\" series, Square Enix also publishes an \"Official Complete Guide\" series of guide books.\n\nA set of three artbooks have also been produced under the title \"The Sky: The Art of Final Fantasy\". The set was first released in Japan in May 2002 by Digicube, then released in North America as a boxed set a decade later on October 17, 2012 by Dark Horse Books with additional postcards, prints, and booklets. A third edition was released in a slipcase by Dark Horse Books on July 17, 2013 without the additional pieces. Each book features concept art by Yoshitaka Amano, with the first book covering \"Final Fantasy I\" through \"III\", the second \"IV\" through \"VI\", and the third \"VII\" through \"X\".\n\nMany \"Final Fantasy\" games have been adapted as novels and manga series. With the advent of the Internet, web novels and digital publishing have also become common. These stories act as companion pieces, offering an interpretation of the game's events or expanding the plot of the games by depicting additional scenarios.\n"}

The band is known for extensive touring and high energy concerts. To date, the band has released five studio albums and five EPs.\n\nThis Is Hell formed in June 2004 when Long Island musicians and members of The Backup Plan, Scraps and Heart Attacks, and Subterfuge got together after their previous bands broke up. The name of the band was originally the title of an Elvis Costello song. The band quickly released a four-song self titled demo EP which was later pressed onto vinyl via Boston label Run for Cover Records & in Europe via Broken Glasses Records. Pressings of the EP sold out quickly and was very well received. The demo gained enough popularity to later be reissued. In support of this demo, the band played over 200 live shows in one year.\n\nAfter the release of their demo and in between touring, the band started working on their next release, a self titled EP. It was released on May 16, 2005 on State of Mind Records. Later that year, the band caught the attention of hardcore punk record label Trustkill Records. The president of Trustkill, Josh Grabelle, stated:\n\nThe band signed to Trustkill shortly after that, and began to work on their debut album \"Sundowning\" to be released on their new label. In May 2006 the album was released and received a very warm reception. Larger magazines including Alternative Press, Metal Hammer, and Rock Sound started featuring the small-time Long Island band, creating a rise in popularity. Their slow rise to fame was also due to their non-stop touring. In 2006 and 2007, This Is Hell participated in the Sounds of the Underground tour which rivaled Ozzfest. In this tour they played alongside As I Lay Dying, Trivium, In Flames, GWAR, Shadows Fall, Every Time I Die and others. In 2006 they were invited to play in the Taste of Chaos tour and the Saints & Sinners Festival. During this time This Is Hell also toured with Comeback Kid, Endwell, It Dies Today, Parkway Drive, Cancer Bats, Glassjaw, Lostprophets, Bayside and several others.\n\nIn April 2006, This Is Hell members Rick Jimenez and Dan Bourke were interested in starting a side project. The two started recruiting local hardcore punk musicians from Long Island and soon formed Soldiers. The band went on to independently release \"The Tombstone EP\", and a full-length album, \"The End of Days\", through Trustkill Records. Soldiers has played live with This Is Hell on a few tours. For these shows, Jimenez and Bourke would play in both bands each night.\n\nAfter the amicable departure of bassist/lyricist Jeff Tiu and the parting of ways with guitarist Joe Osolin, Johnny Moore (ex-Subterfuge, ex-Asternaut) took over on bass as well as becoming the main lyricist, and Chris Reynolds took over second guitar duties. Jeff Tiu went on to front LIHC band Ice Age with Chris Mazella (ex-Subterfuge, current Soldiers) on guitar.\n\nBefore the close of 2007, This Is Hell released two more EPs exclusively on 7\" vinyl records. The first EP, titled \"Cripplers (EP)\" featured cover songs, unreleased songs, and one brand new song. The new song called \"Infected\" was later found on the band's second studio album, but was added to this EP to give fans a taste before the release of the new album. The second EP was a split record with Cancer Bats. This EP featured one new song from each band and one cover of the other band.\n\nAfter several years of non stop touring with larger bands on festival tours, and smaller bands on underground tours, This Is Hell gathered much inspiration for their second studio album titled \"Misfortunes\". With this album, the band created a new more aggressive and raw sound not found on previous efforts. Only a few days after the release the band embarked on their first headlining tour, which included a full US tour followed by a small European tour. After the Euro tour, Chris Reynolds left the band to pursue his project Kill The Frontman and returned to life in upstate NY. The band did a short US/Canadian tour, now as a 4 piece, with Blacklisted, although Blacklisted didn't make it across the border into Canada.\n\nIn October, a small \"early press\" of the This is Hell/Nightmare of You split 7\" from Run For Cover Records was released. From the fall of 08-early winter of 09, This is Hell did more touring throughout the US with bands of all genres. Oct/Nov with Four Year Strong, I Am The Avalanche & A Loss For Words. November with Gravemaker. December with Evergreen Terrace, Four Letter Lie & Casey Jones. Jan/Feb with Funeral for a Friend, The Sleeping & Emarosa. After the last mentioned tour, Dan Bourke left the band and joined fellow long island group, Stray From The Path. Dennis Wilson took over on drums for a Europe headlining tour with Dead Swans and The Blackout Argument.\n\nThis Is Hell mutually split with their label, Trustkill Records, and signed with Rise Records. With new recruits Andrew Jones (bass) and Benny Mead (drums) they released an EP through Think Fast! Records in 2009 called \"Warbirds\". The EP featured covers and new songs, some of which would later appear on their third studio album \"Weight of the World\", which was released on June 8, 2010 through Rise Records.\n\nOctober 11, 2011 saw the release of This Is Hell's fourth full-length studio album \"Black Mass\".\n\nIt was announced on the 17th April 2012 that This Is Hell will be playing the Lock Up stage at Leeds and Reading festival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Morgan most notable songs includes her cover version of Prince's \"Do Me, Baby\" (1985), \"Do You Still Love Me\" (1986) and \"Still in Love With You\" (1992). Born in Queens, New York, Morgan got her start in the music industry while singing with a church gospel choir called the Starlets of Corona.

The RGD-5 was accepted to service in 1954. It is still in service with many of Russia's former client states and has been supplied to Iraq as well as other Arab nations.\n\nThe grenade is egg-shaped with no external ribbing, except for a lateral ridge where the two halves of the grenade join. It weighs . It is in length and in diameter. The surface has a few small dimples on it with a green or olive drab paint-scheme.\n\nThe grenade contains a charge of TNT with an internal fragmentation liner that produces around 350 fragments and has a fatality radius of around and a wounding radius of . Typically, the RGD-5 uses the 3.2 to 4.2 second delay UZRG, UZRGM, or UZRGM-2 fuze, a universal Russian type that is also used in the RG-41, RG-42, and F1 grenades. The RGD-5 can be thrown about by the average male soldier and, when throwing, the grenade will make a loud \"crack\" sound as its spoon falls out activating the fuze, cooking off the grenade.\n\nThis grenade is still manufactured in Russia with copies produced in Bulgaria, China (as the Type 59) and Georgia. Many millions of RGD-5s and its clones have been manufactured over the years and, although not as advanced as more modern grenades that are specifically designed to penetrate CRISAT standard body armour, the RGD-5 is still an effective and inexpensive weapon. A single RGD-5 grenade costs around $5 US, making it highly affordable during a major conflict when many grenades are sought.\n\nThe RGD-5 may also be fitted with the more modern DVM-78 fuze, or variants of the UZRGM with delays of between zero (i.e., instantaneous for use in booby traps) and 13 seconds.

The grenade landed from the podium, near where Saakashvili, his wife Sandra E. Roelofs, Laura Bush, and other officials were seated.\n\nThe grenade failed to detonate. Although original reports indicated that the grenade was not live, it was later revealed that it was. After Arutyunian pulled the pin and threw the grenade, it hit a girl, cushioning its impact. The red handkerchief remained wrapped around the grenade, and it prevented the striker lever from releasing.

In his senior season in 1967, the 6-foot-5 fullback scored 140 points and led the Brothers to a 7–1 record. He was All-City in football and basketball. A High School All-American, he received over 60 scholarship offers to play football.\n\nIn 1991, Patulski was voted to the Greater Syracuse Sports Hall of Fame for his activities as a high school athlete.\n\nAt the University of Notre Dame, Patulski was converted into a defensive end. He was an All-American in 1971, and he won the 1971 Lombardi Award, which is given to college football's best lineman. A Fighting Irish captain, he finished ninth in that year's Heisman Trophy balloting. Selected the Nation's Lineman of the Year by UPI and Gridiron Magazine in 1971. Patulski was named to \"Football News\" sophomore All-America squad in 1969 and was an honorable mention All-American in 1970.\n\nStarted every game in his collegiate career, and totaled 186 tackles, 40 for losses; broke up 10 passes; recovered five fumbles and returned one blocked punt 12 yards. In his final football season at Notre Dame, 1971, he was the team defensive MVP. Patulski made 74 tackles, 22 more than his total for the 1970 season. Seventeen of those stops resulted losses for the opposing team. Patulski also broke up six passes, recovered one fumble. The 1969-1971 Irish rushing defenses and total defenses were ranked in the nation's top six all three years and its scoring defense was in the top ten in 1970 and 1971 and compiled a record of 25–4–1 over those three seasons while Patulski was a starter.\n\nHe was awarded the game ball for his performance in the Irish initial 1971 contest against Northwestern and was acclaimed as national lineman of the week following the North Carolina game. His play versus Michigan State prompted the head coach Duffy Dougherty to hail him as Notre Dame's \"finest defender\".\n\nPatulski was later named to Notre Dame's All-Century team. He played in the 1971 Cotton Bowl Classic and the Hula Bowl. In the Hula Bowl he won the Defensive Lineman of the Game award. In the summer of 1972, Patulski played in the College All-Star game, in Chicago, IL.\nPatulski was lauded by one team as \"(T)he best we've seen for many years.\" All but unstoppable on the pass rush, he dazzled the experts with his \"amazing agility and lateral mobility.\"\n\nPatulski was drafted by the Buffalo Bills with the first overall pick of the 1972 NFL Draft. He was the last Notre Dame player to be drafted #1 overall. His size and speed were among the reasons he was highly touted: At 6'6\" and 250 pounds, he could run the 40 in 4.9 seconds.\n\nAs a rookie, Patulski led the Bills with five sacks. In 1973 the Bills improved to a 9-5 record after going 4-9-1 in his rookie season of 1972, he recorded seven sacks, which was second on the team and was voted AP NFL Defensive Player of the Week November 28, 1973, after Week 11. In 1974, the Bills recorded another 9-5 record and made the playoffs for the first time in eight years as he recorded 5.5 sacks. The Bills were 8-6 during his third season, but did not advance to the AFC playoffs. He recorded four sacks, a career low, however, two came in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals offensive line, who gave up only eight sacks in 1975. He lined up against St. Louis all-pro and Pro Football Hall of Fame offensive tackle Dan Dierdorf. Patulski played four years (1972–1975) with the Bills, and then he was traded to the Cardinals for a second-round draft pick, and played one year with the St. Louis Cardinals (1977). He then suffered career-ending knee injury.\n\nThe Bills considered Patulski expendable when they acquired Sherman White from the Cincinnati Bengals, who was selected second overall in the 1972 draft out of California.\n\nPatulski's career was considered unsuccessful. In fact, ESPN ranked him as the 27th biggest draft bust of all-time on April 18, 2008.\n\nWalt is a recipient of the Key to Syracuse (New York) for his distinguished community service.

Wallis is a graduate of George Washington University. Emily graduated from Boston University where she majored in psychology.\n\nIn September 2016, Bills coach Rex Ryan used Patulski's name as an alias when he posed as a reporter for \"The Buffalo News\" at a press conference for New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. The practical joke led the \"News\" to commission a guest column from the real Patulski following the Bills' win over the Patriots on October 2. The \"News\" then profiled Patulski a month later, in which his relatively disappointing career was largely blamed on two factors: he was in an unusually weak draft class, and his quiet personality clashed with the style of Bills coach Lou Saban. Patulski never spoke to Saban again after his football career ended, despite the opportunities to do so.\n"}

Fletcher never played Test cricket in his playing career.\n\nUnder Fletcher the England cricket team achieved famous series victories away to Sri Lanka, Pakistan, West Indies and South Africa between 2000–2004. In 2004 England won an English record 8 consecutive tests, beating New Zealand 3–0 and West Indies 4–0 at home respectively, before winning the first test in South Africa. His most famous and largest achievement however came in September 2005, when he became the first coach of the English team to win an Ashes series for 18 years when England secured 2–1 victory over Australia.\n\nIn recognition of this winning the Ashes after 18 years, Fletcher was conferred with the OBE. On 13 September 2005 Fletcher was awarded British citizenship after a five-year wait. Although both his parents and all his grandparents were ethnically English, i.e. of English/British descent, Fletcher had been denied citizenship by virtue of the fact he spent most of his time abroad—touring with the England team. After the Ashes series win of 2005, the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, intervened to award Fletcher his long-sought citizenship.\n\nFletcher received heavy criticism from all quarters after preferring Ashley Giles to Monty Panesar as England's main spinner in the first two Tests of the 2006-07 Ashes series; Giles took three wickets in two Tests, while Panesar, when given the chance in the third Test, took five wickets in the first innings and three wickets in the second innings. Following defeat to Australia by 206 runs in the third test on 18 December 2006 which saw England relinquish the Ashes 15 months after gaining them, the England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed that Fletcher's position as head coach was under review. Despite a brief reprieve in early 2007 when England won the Commonwealth Bank Series, Fletcher came under increased criticism as England performed poorly in the World Cup, which culminated in a nine wicket loss to South Africa in which the team were booed off the field by England's Barmy Army. It was later announced, on 19 April 2007, that his 8-year tenure as coach was to end following England's final Super 8 match against the West Indies on Saturday 21 April 2007.\n\nEngland's test record improved almost as soon as Fletcher took over in 1999, however the fortunes of the one-day side plummeted under Fletcher and the only major success in one day cricket under the Fletcher era came a mere three months before his exit, as England won the Commonwealth Bank Series by defeating Australia early in 2007.\n\nIn November 2007 Fletcher confirmed that he was considering a switch to rugby, stating \"I'd like to be a rugby consultant. I have some ideas...I love my rugby, I would rather watch rugby than cricket. I'm passionate about it, it's the game I'd like to have been involved in.\"\n\nOn 5 November 2007 Fletcher's autobiography \"Behind The Shades\" was published.\n\nIn November 2008 it was announced that Fletcher would take on a consultancy role with Hampshire for the 2009 season, days later he took a similar role with the South Africa team ahead of their Test series with Bangladesh and Australia.\n\nFletcher was appointed coach of the India national cricket team on 27 April 2011, with a two-year contract. Fletcher had been one of the leading candidates for the appointment and bagged the job ahead of names like former New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming and former Zimbabwe skipper Andy Flower. Fletcher is reported to have been outgoing India coach Gary Kirsten's recommendation. Under Fletcher's coaching, the Indian national team achieved 8 series victories in a row; including the Champions Trophy in 2013. His contract ended after the World Cup in March 2015 and was not renewed. He was replaced as coach by Anil Kumble.\n\nFletcher's sister, Ann Grant captained the Zimbabwe women's field hockey team which won the gold medal in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\n\nHis brother, Allan Fletcher, played seven first-class games for Rhodesia in the late 1970s.\n\n"}

It is a major component of housing in Hong Kong, with nearly half of the population now residing in some form of public housing. The public housing policy dates to 1954, after a fire in Shek Kip Mei destroyed thousands of shanty homes and prompted the government to begin constructing homes for the poor.\n\nPublic housing is mainly built by the Hong Kong Housing Authority and the Hong Kong Housing Society. Rents and prices are significantly lower than those for private housing and are heavily subsidised by the government, with revenues partially recovered from sources such as rents and charges collected from car parks and shops within or near the residences.\n\nMany public housing estates are built in the new towns of the New Territories, but urban expansion has left some older estates deep in central urban areas. They are found in every district of Hong Kong except in Wan Chai District. The vast majority of public housing are provided in high-rise buildings, and recent blocks usually comprise 40 or more storeys.\n\nThe government has in recent years begun to prioritise economic benefit rather than meeting the demand of citizens. This has led to many citizens who are unable to afford private housing to seek accommodation in subdivided flats and bedspace apartments. The average waiting time for public housing is around six years, with some having to wait for over ten years. \n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, many Mainland Chinese flooded into Hong Kong and resulting in a serious shortage of housing. Thus, in the Housing Committee Report of 1935, the colonial government proposed to build some low-costing housing for public to solve this housing problem. However, Hong Kong was facing an economic downturn at that time, the proposals were not implemented.\n\nOn 25 December 1953, a major fire in Shek Kip Mei destroyed the makeshift homes of refugees from Mainland China, leaving more than 50,000 people homeless. After the fire, and facing a surge of immigrant population, then governor Alexander Grantham launched a public housing program to introduce the idea of \"multi-storey building\" for the immigrant population living there, thus commencing a programme of mass public housing, providing affordable homes for those on low incomes. Some scholars have argued that the government has been overstating the role of the fire in the history of public housing in Hong Kong. For example, Faure argues that Grantham was concerned with introducing subsidised housing as early as 1949, but encountered opposition from Chinese members of the Legislative Council.\n\nThe Shek Kip Mei Estate, ready for occupation in 1954, was the first tangible manifestation of this policy. These resettlement blocks were built in the basic design of H-shape. In those early days, housing units were little more than small cubicles, and the original plan was to allocate per adult and half that for each child under 12. However, they were in reality often occupied by more than one family, due to the extreme shortage of available housing. Facilities and sanitation were rudimentary and communal, like the bath rooms and laundry areas, were located in the cross bar of the \"H\", linked the residential wings on two sides. Rents were pitched at between HK$10 and 14, without caps on income. That year, the Resettlement Department was formed, as was the first Housing Authority (sometimes referred to as \"former Housing Authority\"), out of the Urban Council, through enactment of the 1954 Housing Ordinance. The demolition of the buildings of Shek Kip Mei Estate was started from 2007, and has now been extensively redeveloped. Today, all H-shaped resettlement blocks have had to be demolished, with only the Mei Ho House is still standing.\n\nIn 1961, the \"low-cost housing\" scheme was introduced through the construction of 62,380 flats (capable of housing 363,000 people with monthly household incomes of no more than HK$600) in 18 estates, while HA accommodation would be available to those whose household incomes were between $900 and $1500.\n\nIn 1963, due to the rapid escalation of squatter numbers, squatters' eligibility for public housing was frozen, and future squatter areas came under licensing per the 1964 White Paper. The settlements of these squatters on the urban fringe were cleared in order to provide housing and industrial sites. With the formation of this ad hoc resettlement scheme, it later evolved into a policy tool to support the burgeoning manufacturing industry. The Housing Board was set up with the role of coordinating between agencies responsible for domestic housing. It made recommendations to have annual evaluations of supply and demand of housing, as well as increasing the minimum standard floor area per person to .\n\nLower Ngau Tau Kok Estate, built between 1967 and 1970, was among the first group of resettlement estates built with lifts. All blocks were 16-floor high, and lifts from the ground floor could reach the 8th and the 13th floors.\n\nIn 1973, the Government of Hong Kong announced a ten-year plan for the public provision of housing, to provide everyone in Hong Kong with permanent, self-contained housing with a target of housing. The objective was to provide 1.8 million people with \"satisfactory accommodation\". The Government saw as its responsibility to provide accessible housing for \"the poor\" – defined as those whose monthly household income was between HK$2,100 (for a family of 3) and HK$3,150 (for a family of 10).\n\nIn 1975, the Government officially opened the Oi Man Estate. The blocks were built in twin-tower layout with two square blocks interlocked together. There were sixteen large and small units on each floor of the block, and each flat with its own kitchen and toilet inside. The housing estate was also built on a concept of \"a little town within a city\". The estate of 6,200 flats, constructed on a site of and capable of housing 46,000 people, offered a self-contained environment complete with commercial amenities ranging from markets and barber shops to banks. This represented an innovation in that the commercial premises would serve the local estate, while paying a rent determined by public tender. Banks, restaurants, and other large premises would be let out on a five-year contract, competing on a monthly rental offered, while tenants for smaller premises would compete on premium paid based on fixed monthly rentals. Unlike the generations of housing estates which preceded it, there would be designated market stalls and cooked-food stalls. Street vendors would be no longer be tolerated.\n\nIn 1980, the government launched the first batch of public housing in the Home Ownership Scheme, thereby allowing low-income families to own their homes for the first time.\n\nA new town to be constructed on 240 hectares of reclaimed fishponds and wetland was conceived in 1987 to house 140,000 people. Since Tin Shui Wai was entirely a virgin development, it was conceived with wider walkways and larger open areas when compared to other urban developments in Hong Kong.\n\nA 1988 crime survey reported that crime rates were lower in the public housing estates of Hong Kong than in private housing areas.\n\nPublic housing estates in Hong Kong may be rented or sold under various government subsidy programmes, and are generally subject to a range of restrictions and eligibility requirements. They also vary in scale, and are built and managed under the responsibility of the Hong Kong Housing Authority and the Hong Kong Housing Society. According to the 2006 census, 3.3 million people or 48.8 percent of the population of Hong Kong lived in rental or subsidised-sale public housing; within that group, 31 percent lived in public rental housing, 17.1 percent lived in Housing Authority subsidised-sale flats and 0.7 percent lived in Housing Society subsidised-sale flats.\n\n\nSeveral designs have been used for the blocks of the public housing estates, including:\n\nAccording to the Cooperate Profile from Hong Kong Housing Authority in September 2014 and Hong Kong Housing Society info bank in June 2015:\n\nThe Government updated the long term housing supply target to 480 000 units for the ten-year period from 2015/16 to 2024/25. Among them, the target for PRH is 200 000 flats while that for subsidised sale flats (mainly HOS flats) is 90 000 units.\n\nThe following is a list of selected public housing estates and their specificities:\n\nSeveral public housing estates have received awards from the Hong Kong Institute of Architects:\n\n"}
{"id": "2195142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195142", "title": "Wallflower (people)", "text": "Wallflower (people)\n\nA wallflower is someone with an introverted personality type (or in more extreme cases, social anxiety) who will attend parties and social gatherings, but will usually distance themselves from the crowd and actively avoid being in the limelight.\n\nThe name itself derives from eponymous plant's unusual growth pattern; against a wall as a stake or in cracks and gaps in stone walls. \"Wallflowers\" might literally stand against a wall and simply observe others at a social gathering, rather than mingle. This could be due to anxiety, shyness, lack of social skills or self-esteem.\n\nWallflower can also be used on a grander scale. When a company or organization chooses or is forced to remain on the sidelines of any activity, they can be referred to as a \"wallflower\".\n\nStructural functionalism is a sociological theory that sees society as a number of complex parts that form a stable and functional whole. This leads to a strong and coherent family unit made of smaller parts, with the functioning family unit then going on to form the smaller parts of a wider community, society and so on.\n\nSocial conflict theory in sociology claims that society is in a state of perpetual conflict due to competition for limited resources. It holds that social order is maintained by domination and power, rather than consensus and conformity. According to conflict theory, those with wealth and power try to hold on to it by any means possible, chiefly by suppressing the poor and powerless.\n\nThe most relevant sociological theory that the \"wallflower\" relates to, Symbolic Interaction describes specific gestures or social norms that are symbolic in meaning. The theory consists of three core principles: meaning, language and thought. These core principles lead to conclusions about the creation of a person’s self and socialization into a larger community.\n\nBecause the \"wallflower\" will usually exhibit a \"lack of\" interaction with others, it becomes symbolic of their thoughts and feelings towards others. The most specific example would be in the body language. Many times people who are shy have little or no eye contact with others. You may see a man, woman, or child try to avoid eye contact with others while out walking around in public or even in private. For some this may be a condition that becomes consistent over time and become a normal action.\n\nIn the case of parties or social gatherings, the \"wallflower\" will remain at a certain distance from the crowd or most of the people. When a shy person is around others you may see that they do what they can to stay away from the people that they do not know. Even with some friends you may or may not see the shy man or woman even near or in the Bell Bubble or within the intimate distance of friends. In a social setting you may not see a shy person in the center of the room without a friend or group of friends. Shy people tend to stay out of the possibility of even being the center of attention.\n\nSocial anxiety the extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations: Social anxiety disorder can wreak havoc on the lives of those who suffer from it. Symptoms may be so extreme that they disrupt daily life. People with this disorder, also called \"social phobia\", may have few or no social or romantic relationships, making them feel powerless, alone, or even ashamed.\n\nAlthough they recognize that the fear is excessive and unreasonable, people with social anxiety disorder feel powerless against their anxiety. They are terrified they will humiliate or embarrass themselves. The anxiety can interfere significantly with daily routines, occupational performance, or social life, making it difficult to complete school, interview and get a job, and have friendships and romantic relationships.\n\nBeing a wallflower can be considered a less-intense form of social anxiety. A person with social anxiety may feel a sense of hesitation in large crowds, and may even have a sense of panic if forced to become the center of attention. This fear may cause them to do something as minor as stand away from the center of a party, but it may also cause a major or minor anxiety attack.\n\nPeople with social anxiety disorder do not believe that their anxiety is related to a mental or physical illness. This type of anxiety occurs in most social situations, especially when the person feels on display or is the center of attention. Once a person avoids almost all social and public interactions, it can be said that the person has an extreme case of social anxiety disorder, more commonly called Avoidant Personality Disorder. People with social anxiety disorder have an elevated rate of relationship difficulties and substance abuse.\n\nAnxiety attacks are a combination of physical and mental symptoms that are intense and overwhelming. The anxiety is, however, more than just regular nervousness. Symptoms of anxiety attacks and panic attacks mimic serious medical issues, such as:\n\nDespite their intensity, anxiety attacks are generally not life-threatening.\n\n"}

With a mass greater than that of any previous space station, \"Mir\" was the first of the non-monolithic, third generation of space stations, constructed from 1986 to 1996 with a modular design. The station was the largest artificial satellite orbiting the Earth until its deorbit on 21 March 2001, a record now surpassed by the International Space Station (ISS). \"Mir\" served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology and spacecraft systems in order to develop technologies required for the permanent occupation of space.\n\nFollowing the success of the Salyut programme, \"Mir\" represented the next stage in the Soviet Union's space station programme. The first module of the station, known as the core module or base block, was launched in 1986, and was followed by six further modules (\"Kvant\"-1 (1987), \"Kvant\"-2 (1989), \"Kristall\" (1990), \"Spektr\" (1995), the docking module (1995) and \"Priroda\" (1996)), all launched by Proton rockets (with the exception of the docking module). When complete, the station consisted of seven pressurised modules and several unpressurised components. Power was provided by several solar arrays mounted directly on the modules. The station was maintained at an orbit between and altitude and travelled at an average speed of 27,700 km/h (17,200 mph), completing 15.7 Earth orbits per day.\n\nHuman spaceflights were vital to the operation of \"Mir\", allowing crews and equipment to be carried to and from the space station. \"Mir\" was visited by a total of 39 manned missions, comprising 30 Soyuz flights (1 Soyuz-T, 29 Soyuz-TM) and 9 Space Shuttle flights. These missions carried both long-duration crew members flying \"principal expeditions\" (ranging from 70 days up to Valeri Polyakov's 14-month stay beginning in January 1994, which still holds the record for the longest continuous spaceflight by a single person) and short-term visitors (who spent about a week aboard the station). Many of the crew who visited \"Mir\" used different spacecraft to launch than they did to land; the first such examples were Aleksandr Viktorenko and Muhammed Faris who flew up in Soyuz TM-3 (launched 22 July 1987) and landed a week later in Soyuz TM-2 on 30 July 1987.

The victims included five female members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and military personnel. At the time, this was the deadliest airline crash in the history of American commercial aviation. Another 66 lives had been lost earlier that year in the March 22 crash in Hawaii of a United States Navy Douglas R6D-1 Liftmaster military transport aircraft, and 66 had also died in the mid-air collision of two United States Air Force C-119G Flying Boxcars over West Germany on August 11, placing the three crashes in a three-way tie as the deadliest aviation incidents in 1955.\n\nFlight 409 left New York, New York one hour and 11 minutes late. Routine crew changes were made in Chicago and Denver. Flight 409 departed Denver, Colorado at 6:33 a.m. on October 6, 1955, 83 minutes after its scheduled departure time. The assigned path the airliner was expected to fly was along airways V-4 Denver to Laramie, Wyoming V-118 to Rock River, Wyoming radio, V-6 to Fort Bridger, Wyoming, and V-32 to a landing in Salt Lake City. The flight was operating under Visual Flight Rules and was assigned a cruising altitude of 10,000 feet. Because the aircraft was not pressurized, the altitude was chosen to keep the passengers and crew from experiencing the discomfort that flying higher could cause. The route assigned to the airliner was specifically designed to allow safe passage at 10,000 feet over the continental divide in the Rocky Mountains.\n\nAn expected position report from the United crew, scheduled for 8:11 a.m. while over Rock Springs, was not received, and repeated attempts to make radio contact with flight 409 were met with no response. With the airliner's status unknown, the Civil Aeronautics Authority was alerted to the missing aircraft. No radar was in place for civil aviation in this region in 1955. With no radar traces, manual searches were required to find the aircraft.\n\nThe Wyoming Air National Guard launched two search aircraft: a two-seat T-33 Shooting Star piloted by Mel Conine and a single seat F-80 Shooting Star piloted by Ed Weed. Working on the assumption that the United plane may have taken an unauthorized short cut to make up for the 83-minute delay out of Denver, the two search planes pointed their aircraft toward the highest mountains in the region, Elk Mountain and Medicine Bow Peak. After a search of Elk Mountain failed to find the missing DC-4, Conine and his observer spotted at 11:40 a.m. a black stain and wreckage just southwest of the highest portion of Medicine Bow Peak. Turbulence kept them too far away to locate any possible survivors and they left the site to return to their base in Cheyenne.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" (Oct. 7, 1955) reported:\n\"First rescuers to reach the scene said they had found about 50 bodies strewn along a 300-foot course down the face of the mountain. Only a tail piece, part of the fuselage and a wing of the plane had been located at mid-afternoon by rescuers who fought snowdrifts and a howling wind on the 12,005-foot Medicine Bow Peak. The mountain is about 40 miles west of here in the Snowy Range. The front part of the split plane was believed to have fallen down the other side of the peak. Another rescue group went up the north face of the mountain from Rawlins. The operation was suspended this evening because of a snowstorm and darkness.\n\nThe scene was marked by two huge patches of oil where the plane's engines apparently struck about 50-75 feet from the peak. The wreckage then slid down the steep incline in two ravines, much of it coming to rest 300 feet down on a small glacier. I don't see how there would be a chance of anyone surviving, said Capt. Conine, Wyoming Air National Guard jet pilot, who was one of the first to spot the wreckage.\n\nA C-47 was sent from Cheyenne, Wyo., to circle the peak, particularly the northwest side, to search for the front portion of the plane. The Civil Aeronautics Administration said planes were unable to fly near the mountain because of the weather conditions.\nRecovery of the widely scattered remains of the victims was extremely challenging due to the difficult terrain at the crash site. At the base of the almost perpendicular cliff where the aircraft hit, movement was hindered by a wide talus of weathered, fragmented rock and large boulders, all piled loosely on a steep slope. Mountaineers doing the recovery work also had to be constantly wary of rock falls that might be triggered by the activities of those above them on the cliff face. Cold weather and occasional snow also played a role in impeding recovery efforts. The recovery of human remains was not completed until the evening of October 11, 1955, five full days after the accident.\n\nDue to safety concerns, the CAB accident investigation team —not trained in alpine mountaineering techniques— was unable to visit the cliff location where the DC-4 initially hit. Study of the wreckage that could be retrieved for examination suggested a nose up attitude and an unusually low airspeed of the plane, implying that the plane was attempting a climb at the time of its crash. The reasons for this are not explicitly known, but several theories exist:\n\n\nPossible incapacitation of crew by carbon monoxide emanating from a faulty cabin heater was speculated upon based on recovery crew observations that crew bodies appeared 'discolored.' This theory was never proven, and the CAB report specifically states that there was no evidence to support crew incapacitation.\n\nAfter the investigation of the accessible wreckage was completed, United Airlines requested that the remaining debris be destroyed by the military. Attempts were made to accomplish this, but despite the use of explosives, artillery fire and —according to most sources— napalm bombs dropped from aircraft, complete obliteration of the wreckage was not possible. One source, a 2007 book about the Rocky Mountain Rescue Group, contradicts the assertion that military jets bombed the site with napalm; instead, the book states that the cliff face was mined with explosives that were detonated in the spring of 1956, and the event was tightly controlled and not publicized. Regardless of the disposal method, small fragments of flight 409's airframe and parts of the engines still exist in the area surrounding the crash site. \n\nPrior to the loss of United 409, the deadliest scheduled airline accident in U.S. history was the June 1950 disappearance of Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 2501 over Lake Michigan, when 58 died. The 66 lives lost on Medicine Bow Peak remained the highest death toll on a scheduled airline flight in the U.S. for less than a year. In June 1956 two airliners, a Super Constellation and a DC-7, collided over the Grand Canyon, killing 128 people. Flight 409's crash, and other crashes and mid-air collisions in the United States that occurred over the next several years, convinced the U.S. Congress to improve airline safety procedures, and to increase civil aviation radar coverage.\n\nOn August 25, 2001, a privately funded bronze memorial plaque was dedicated in the Miner's Camp turnout (), along Wyoming Highway 130 (Snowy Range Road). The plaque faces the mountain where the crash occurred. The plaque reads, \"In memory of the 66 passengers and crew that perished on Medicine Bow Peak October 6, 1955\".\n\n\n\n"}

They are composed of detachments from the Federal Police and the State Police forces of Germany.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of the Interior maintains an office of the \"Bereitschaftspolizei\" in Berlin which monitors and coordinates the deployment of all \"Bereitschaftspolizei\" units in Germany. The ministry also provides standardized weapons, vehicles and other equipment.\nThe \"Bundespolizei\" maintains 10 rapid reaction battalions (called \"Bundespolizeiabteilung\" or BPA) stationed around the country in Ratzeburg, Uelzen, Blumberg, Bad Düben, Duderstadt, Sankt Augustin, Hünfeld, Bayreuth, Bad Bergzabern and Deggendorf. These units can reinforce the federal police in any sphere of its missions and support the police forces of the \"Länder\". They are also trained to assist local authorities in case of disasters and uprisings. Under new interior ministry plans, the number of \"Bereitschaftspolizei\" companies will increase from 28 to 29 comprising approx. 25 percent of Germany’s police support units. \n\nThe state \"Bereitschaftspolizei\" units are part of the \"Landespolizei\" (state police) and are available for crowd control, (large) demonstrations, sport events and to assist the \"Schutzpolizei\" when needed. Aside from their primary functions, in some states they also train police recruits who serve about three years in combined training and service in these police support units. The units of one federal state can be deployed to assist the police of another state in case of riots, civil disturbances as well as catastrophes. Their day-to-day duties vary by locality. \nIn Hamburg they patrol the subway system (alongside the security service), assist in raids (f.i. in the red-light district or organised crime), perform traffic control duty and support regular police officers on patrols. \nSome states (e.g. the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg) have a hybrid system, where units of the \"Schutzpolizei\" may act as units of the \"Bereitschaftspolizei\" (f.i. for sudden or large riots or terror attacks) - they form so-called \"Alarm-Hundertschaften\" with units from all Hamburg police stations (to ensure the performance of the regular tasks of the stations in the same time) to respond as fast as possible.\n\nThe structure, equipment and training of Bepo units is standard so that units from different parts of Germany can operate together without any problems. \n\nThe \"Bereitschaftspolizei\" is assigned to barracks and organized into sections, platoons and 120 to 150 person training or rapid reaction companies called \"Hundertschaften\". In most \"Länder\", the \"Bereitschaftspolizei\" contingents are formed into 600 - 800 person battalions, but in the six largest \"Länder\" they are organized into regiments.\nSome police forces like Hamburg have additional alert platoons that are part of the state police and manned by regular police officers in case of urgent need when support from the state or the Federal Police is not available.\n\nThe units are equipped with their own transport and rations allowing them to be deployed quickly to other \"Länder\" without having to rely on outside support. They are equipped with a wide varirty of specialised vehicles such as armoured cars, buses, water cannons, earth moving equipment and command and control vehicles. \n\nArrest units give the Bepos special capabilities to secure evidence and arrest perpetrators at events where large crowds normally impede police operations.\n\n\"See article: Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft\"\nThe East German Ministry of the Interior maintained the independent Department of the Alert Units of the \"Volkspolizei\" known as the \"Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften\" (VPB). It consisted of between 12,000 and 15,000 men (sources disagree) in 21 \"Volkspolizei\" Alert Units of battalion strength. There was usually one unit per district of East Germany but the key districts of Halle, Leipzig and Magdeburg, with their large working class populations, and Potsdam all had two units. The Presidium of the People's Police in East Berlin had three units located in Basdorf.\n\nEach Alert unit was organized as follows:\n\nThese units were equipped with light and medium infantry weapons, SK-1 wheeled armoured personnel carriers, SK-2 water cannon (both armoured and unarmoured versions) and buses. Their uniform was the standard \"Volkspolizei\" grey-green. The political reliability of the Alert Units was of particular importance to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) as they would be used against the population in the event of social disorders such as the strike of 17 June 1953 in the industrial areas of East Germany.\n"}

He trained as a topographical draughtsman, wrote and illustrated many books early in his career, before concentrating on his architectural practice.\n\nBillings was born in the Bayswater area of London in 1812. At the age of thirteen he was apprenticed to the topographical draughtsman John Britton for seven years. In 1837 he illustrated George Godwin's \"History and Description of St. Paul's Cathedral\", and two years later, with Frederick Mackenzie, the two volumes of Godwin's \"Churches of London\". He assisted Sir Jeffry Wyattville on drawings of Windsor Castle, and prepared many views of the ruins of the old Houses of Parliament after the fire.\n\nThe works he undertook on his own account included \"Illustrations of the Temple Church, London\", (1838); \"Gothic Panelling in Brancepeth Church, Durham\" (1841) and \"Kettering Church, Northamptonshire\" (1843). He produced important works on Carlisle Cathedral and Durham Cathedral, published in 1840 and 1843, and \"Illustrations of the Architectural Antiquities of the County of Durham\" (1846). The work for which he became best known was \"The Baronial and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Scotland\", published in four volumes between 1845 and 1852, which contained 240 illustrations, with explanatory text. The work was a great success and was reprinted several times, in 1899, 1900, 1901, 1908, 1909, 2008, 2012, 2015, 2016 and 2017. In the 1901 edition it was revealed that all the commentaries were written by John Hill Burton, the edition included a foreword by Robert Rowand Anderson. Anderson wrote in the foreword of it being \"in the front rank of Architectural publications, and from this position it has yet to be displaced.\"\n\nHis other published works were \"An Attempt to define the Geometric Proportions of Gothic Architecture, as illustrated by the Cathedrals of Carlisle and Worcester\" (1840) \"Illustrations of Geometric Tracery, from the panelling belonging to Carlisle Cathedral\" 1842 ; \"The Infinity of Geometric Design exemplified\" (1849) and \"The Power of Form applied to Geometric Tracery\" (1851).\nThe \"Attempt to Define the Geometric Proportions of Gothic Architecture\" has been the subject of scholarly interpretation. A reviewer in \"The Art Journal\" explained that Billings had deduced that the architect of Carlisle Cathedral: had been guided by the repetition of a circle whose diameter was the extreme width of the building; that the distribution and even the substance of the columns were settled by some subdivision of the same circle; and lastly, that a circle regulated by the width of the compartments thus formed, was the basis upon which the heights of the various portions of the building were framed.\n\nEventually he gave up authorship, and devoted himself entirely to his architectural practice. He was employed on the restoration of the chapel of Edinburgh Castle (a government commission); the Douglas Room in Stirling Castle; Gosford House, Haddingtonshire, for the Earl of Wemyss; the restoration of Hanbury Hall, Worcestershire; Crosby-on-Eden Church, Cumberland and Kemble House and Vicarage, Wiltshire. In 1865 Billings erected an unusual memorial to fellow architect Peter Nicholson (1765–1844) in Carlisle cemetery, in the form of a pair of interpenetrating obelisks.\n\nFrom 1865 Billings lived at Putney, where he purchased the Moulinère, a house once occupied by the Duchess of Marlborough. He died there 14 November 1874.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2195185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195185", "title": "ATM serine/threonine kinase", "text": "ATM serine/threonine kinase\n\nATM serine/threonine kinase, symbol ATM, is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is recruited and activated by DNA double-strand breaks. It phosphorylates several key proteins that initiate activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, leading to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis. Several of these targets, including p53, CHK2, BRCA1, NBS1 and H2AX are tumor suppressors.\n\nIn 1995, the gene was discovered by Dr. Yosef Shiloh who named its product ATM since he found that its mutations are responsible for the disorder ataxia–telangiectasia. In 1998, the Shiloh and Kastan laboratories independently showed that ATM is a protein kinase whose activity is enhanced by DNA damage.\n\nThroughout the cell cycle DNA is monitored for damage. Damages result from errors during replication, by-products of metabolism, general toxic drugs or ionizing radiation. The cell cycle has different DNA damage checkpoints, which inhibit the next or maintain the current cell cycle step. There are two main checkpoints, the G1/S and the G2/M, during the cell cycle, which preserve correct progression. ATM plays a role in cell cycle delay after DNA damage, especially after double-strand breaks (DSBs). ATM is recruited to sites of double strand breaks by DSB sensor proteins, such as the MRN complex. After being recruited, it phosphorylates NBS1, along other DSB repair proteins. These modified mediator proteins then amplify the DNA damage signal, and transduce the signals to downstream effectors such as CHK2 and p53.\n\nThe ATM gene codes for a 350 kDa protein consisting of 3056 amino acids. ATM belongs to the superfamily of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs). The PIKK superfamily comprises six Ser/Thr-protein kinases that show a sequence similarity to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks). This protein kinase family includes ATR (ATM- and RAD3-related), DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit) and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Characteristic for ATM are five domains. These are from N-terminus to C-terminus the HEAT repeat domain, the FRAP-ATM-TRRAP (FAT) domain, the kinase domain (KD), the PIKK-regulatory domain (PRD) and the FAT-C-terminal (FATC) domain. The HEAT repeats directly bind to the C-terminus of NBS1. The FAT domain interacts with ATM's kinase domain to stabilize the C-terminus region of ATM itself. The KD domain resumes kinase activity, while the PRD and the FATC domain regulate it. Although no structure for ATM has been solved, the overall shape of ATM is very similar to DNA-PKcs and is composed of a head and a long arm that is thought to wrap around double-stranded DNA after a conformational change. The entire N-terminal domain together with the FAT domain are predicted to adopt an α-helical structure, which was found by sequence analysis. This α-helical structure is believed to form a tertiary structure, which has a curved, tubular shape present for example in the Huntingtin protein, which also contains HEAT repeats. FATC is the C-terminal domain with a length of about 30 amino acids. It is highly conserved and consists of an α-helix followed by a sharp turn, which is stabilized by a disulfide bond.\n\nA complex of the three proteins MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1 (XRS2 in yeast), called the MRN complex in humans, recruits ATM to double strand breaks (DSBs) and holds the two ends together. ATM directly interacts with the NBS1 subunit and phosphorylates the histone variant H2AX on Ser139. This phosphorylation generates binding sites for adaptor proteins with a BRCT domain. These adaptor proteins then recruit different factors including the effector protein kinase CHK2 and the tumor suppressor p53. The ATM-mediated DNA damage response consists of a rapid and a delayed response. The effector kinase CHK2 is phosphorylated and thereby activated by ATM. Activated CHK2 phosphorylates phosphatase CDC25A, which is degraded thereupon and can no longer dephosphorylate CDK1-cyclin B, resulting in cell-cycle arrest. If the DSB can not be repaired during this rapid response, ATM additionally phosphorylates MDM2 and p53 at Ser15. p53 is also phosphorylated by the effector kinase CHK2. These phosphorylation events lead to stabilization and activation of p53 and subsequent transcription of numerous p53 target genes including CDK inhibitor p21 which lead to long-term cell-cycle arrest or even apoptosis.\n\nThe protein kinase ATM may also be involved in mitochondrial homeostasis, as a regulator of mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) whereby old, dysfunctional mitochondria are removed. Increased ATM activity also occurs in viral infection where ATM is activated early during dengue virus infection as part of autophagy induction and ER stress response.\n\nA functional MRN complex is required for ATM activation after DSBs. The complex functions upstream of ATM in mammalian cells and induces conformational changes that facilitate an increase in the affinity of ATM towards its substrates, such as CHK2 and p53.\nInactive ATM is present in the cells without DSBs as dimers or multimers. Upon DNA damage, ATM autophosphorylates on residue Ser1981. This phosphorylation provokes dissociation of ATM dimers, which is followed by the release of active ATM monomers. Further autophosphorylation (of residues Ser367 and Ser1893) is required for normal activity of the ATM kinase. Activation of ATM by the MRN complex is preceded by at least two steps, i.e. recruitment of ATM to DSB ends by the mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1) which binds to MRE11, and the subsequent stimulation of kinase activity with the NBS1 C-terminus.\nThe three domains FAT, PRD and FATC are all involved in regulating the activity of the KD kinase domain. The FAT domain interacts with ATM's KD domain to stabilize the C-terminus region of ATM itself. The FATC domain is critical for kinase activity and highly sensitive to mutagenesis. It mediates protein-protein interaction for example with the histone acetyltransferase TIP60 (HIV-1 Tat interacting protein 60 kDa), which acetylates ATM on residue Lys3016. The acetylation occurs in the C-terminal half of the PRD domain and is required for ATM kinase activation and for its conversion into monomers. While deletion of the entire PRD domain abolishes the kinase activity of ATM, specific small deletions show no effect.\n\nAtaxia–telangiectasia (AT) is a rare human disease characterized by cerebellar degeneration, extreme cellular sensitivity to radiation and a predisposition to cancer. All AT patients contain mutations in the ATM gene. Most other AT-like disorders are defective in genes encoding the MRN protein complex. One feature of the ATM protein is its rapid increase in kinase activity immediately following double-strand break formation. The phenotypic manifestation of AT is due to the broad range of substrates for the ATM kinase, involving DNA repair, apoptosis, G/S, intra-S checkpoint and G/M checkpoints, gene regulation, translation initiation, and telomere maintenance. Therefore, a defect in ATM has severe consequences in repairing certain types of damage to DNA, and cancer may result from improper repair. AT patients have an increased risk for breast cancer that has been ascribed to ATM's interaction and phosphorylation of BRCA1 and its associated proteins following DNA damage. Certain kinds of leukemias and lymphomas, including mantle cell lymphoma, T-ALL, atypical B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and T-PLL are also associated with ATM defects.\n\nMutations in the ATM gene are found at relatively low frequencies in sporadic cancers. According to \"COSMIC\", the \"Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer\", the frequencies with which heterozygous mutations in ATM are found in common cancers include 0.7% in 713 ovarian cancers, 0.9% in central nervous system cancers, 1.9% in 1,120 breast cancers, 2.1% in 847 kidney cancers, 4.6% in colon cancers, 7.2% among 1,040 lung cancers and 11.1% in 1790 hematopoetic and lymphoid tissue cancers.\n\nATM is one of the DNA repair genes frequently hypermethylated in its promoter region in various cancers (see table of such genes in Cancer epigenetics). The promoter methylation of ATM causes reduced protein or mRNA expression of ATM.\n\nMore than 73% of brain tumors were found to be methylated in the ATM gene promoter and there was strong inverse correlation between ATM promoter methylation and its protein expression (p < 0.001).\n\nThe ATM gene promoter was observed to be hypermethylated in 53% of small (impalpable) breast cancers and was hypermethylated in 78% of stage II or greater breast cancers with a highly significant correlation (P = 0.0006) between reduced ATM mRNA abundance and aberrant methylation of the ATM gene promoter.\n\nIn non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the ATM promoter methylation status of paired tumors and surrounding histologically uninvolved lung tissue was found to be 69% and 59%, respectively. However, in more advanced NSCLC the frequency of ATM promoter methylation was lower at 22%. The finding of ATM promoter methylation in surrounding histologically uninvolved lung tissue suggests that ATM deficiency may be present early in a field defect leading to progression to NSCLC.\n\nIn squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, 42% of tumors displayed ATM promoter methylation.\n\nDNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer, and deficiencies in DNA repair likely underlie many forms of cancer. If DNA repair is deficient, DNA damage tends to accumulate. Such excess DNA damage may increase mutational errors during DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Excess DNA damage may also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations may give rise to cancer. The frequent epigenetic deficiency of ATM in a number of cancers likely contributed to the progression of those cancers.\n\nATM functions during meiotic prophase. The wild-type ATM gene is expressed at a four-fold increased level in human testes compared to somatic cells (such as skin fibroblasts). In both mice and humans, ATM deficiency results in female and male infertility. Deficient ATM expression causes severe meiotic disruption during prophase I. In addition, impaired ATM-mediated DNA DSB repair has been identified as a likely cause of aging of mouse and human oocytes. Expression of the ATM gene, as well as other key DSB repair genes, declines with age in mouse and human oocytes and this decline is paralleled by an increase of DSBs in primordial follicles. These findings indicate that ATM-mediated homologous recombinational repair is a crucial function of meiosis.\n\nAtaxia telangiectasia mutated has been shown to interact with:\n\nThe Tefu protein of \"Drosophila melanogaster\" is a structural and functional homolog of the human ATM protein. Tefu, like ATM, is required for DNA repair and normal levels of meiotic recombination in oocytes.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2195194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195194", "title": "KSHE", "text": "KSHE\n\nKSHE (styled as K-SHE) is a Classic rock radio station licensed to Crestwood, Missouri which serves the Greater St. Louis area. KSHE transmits on 94.7 MHz and currently uses the slogan \"KSHE 95, Real Rock Radio\". Owned by Hubbard Broadcasting, the station's studios are located in Creve Coeur, while the transmitter is located in Shrewsbury.\n\nKSHE recently announced its first HD Radio subchannel, which will broadcast a 24-hour version of longtime personality John Ulett's \"KSHE Klassics\" show.\n\nAs of May 2019, KSHE has started using the slogan “The Rock of St. Louis” and started advertising the KSHE Amazon Alexa skill on the air waves.\n\nAfter working as an engineer for 20 years with the Pulitzer stations, KSD and KSD-TV, Ed Ceries invested his life savings and his considerable engineering efforts in building his own FM station, which he called KSHE. He literally built some of the equipment himself, and on February 11, 1961, the station signed on from the basement of the Ceries' home in suburban Crestwood. The station called itself \"The Lady of FM,\" and had a classical music format. For a while, all the announcers were women. Most of the basement was used for the station operations, with the Associated Press Teletype installed next to the clothes washer. The record library room doubled as an administrative office where Mrs. Ceries also did her ironing. Listener loyalty was strong, and at times they would come to the station with copies of classical selections they thought were better than the ones being played on KSHE. Unfortunately, advertisers were not convinced FM radio—particularly classical music on FM radio—had much of an audience. After the first year, the format was adjusted to contain about 90% middle-of-the-road music and 10% classical, with nine daily news broadcasts. In 1964, the station was sold to Century Broadcasting.\n\nNew general manager Howard Grafman was convinced by his friend Ron Elz to adopt a new format that Elz had heard on a trip to San Francisco on KMPX: album-oriented rock, with high latitude given to individual DJs as to what to play. During the 1970s and early 1980s, KSHE was influential in the growth of many midwestern bands such as Styx, Cheap Trick, REO Speedwagon and Head East. KSHE had a wide and varied play list, which popularized such rock artists as Lake from Germany, Stingray from South Africa, and rising bands from Australia and New Zealand like Midnight Oil and Split Enz, as well as playing the classics from the more well-known rock legends. The very first rock song played on KSHE in November 1967 that ushered in their format change ,was Jefferson Airplane's \"White Rabbit\".\n\nKSHE sometimes played music nonstop for hours without station identification, which eventually was brought to the attention of the FCC and warnings from the agency to identify as required. In late 1967, '68 and most of '69 they would play whole albums in the late afternoon and late at night any day of the week. Albums played in their entirety included such titles as The Firesign Theatre's \"Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him\", The Who's \"Tommy\", Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band's Gorilla \"Gorilla (Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band album)\", Arlo Guthrie's \"Alice's Restaurant\", and Iron Butterfly's \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\", just to name a few. KSHE would frequently play concept albums in their entirety, as well as entire album sides from favorites such as Rush. Sunday evenings were dedicated to playing seven albums from seven different artists on a show called the \"Seventh Day\" starting in the late 1970s, a program that continues to this day. The albums usually were played from 7:00 pm until after midnight. The \"Seventh Day\" concept was later used by other stations around the country.\n\nInstead of the broadcast convention of reading news ripped from the Associated Press or United Press International wire machine (\"rip and read\"), early KSHE newscasts introduced news topics by preceding the story with rock music excerpts that had lyrics introducing or commenting on the topic.\n\nKSHE created a virtual museum on its website as a way of celebrating its 40th birthday. It contains video clips, audio clips, pictures and memorabilia. The first inductees (2007) were Rush, Kiss, Ted Nugent, and REO Speedwagon.\n\nIn March 2010, KSHE held its annual March Bandness—the third-longest version of this contest in the US. Along with the typical classic rock, KSHE's format also includes standard modern rock. KSHE also has various subgenres for various times of day, such as Hair Band Doran (DJ: Mike Doran) from 8pm-9pm weekdays (previously called '80s at 8 under the previous DJ, Katy Kruze) and Monday Night Metal with Tom \"Real Rock\" Terbrock on Tuesday nights from 9 pm to midnight (originally on Monday night at 10 pm with Radio/Radical Rich from the mid-'80s until 1987 when it was moved to Tuesday night, until it was canceled in the mid-'90s; returning with Terbrock in the summer of 2006). At 5 pm each weekday, KSHE plays \"The Daily Dose\", two Led Zeppelin songs presented with trivia about their creation or notable performances of the songs.\n\nThe station mascot is a sunglasses-and-headphones-wearing pig named \"Sweetmeat,\" the likeness of which originally appeared on the cover of Blodwyn Pig's 1969 album 'Ahead Rings Out'.\n\nLike the pig pictured on the LP cover, Sweetmeat first appeared with a joint in his mouth.

In addition, Auvil received the state of Washington's highest honor, The Washington Medal of Merit, from Governor Gary Locke.\n\nGrady Auvil was born on December 7, 1905, in Yeager, West Virginia, to Llewellyn Auvil and Ida (Ashworth) Auvil. At the age of two years, Auvil's family moved to Entiat in Washington state. Auvil was raised in Entiat, where in 1922 he graduated from high school. Auvil attended and graduated from Washington State University and in 1928 moved to Orondo. At the age of 22, Auvil founded Auvil Fruit Company. In 1934, Auvil married Lillie O. Grandt in Withrow at Lillie's parents' house.\n\nDuring Auvil's time in his business \"Auvil Fruit Company\", he made many industry introductions with new fruits and innovations that revolutionized not only his business but the entire field that it was in. For instance: Auvil introduced the \"Red Haven Peach\" to the North Western United States in 1941, he developed the practice and use of grass cover for orchards in 1948. In 1952, Auvil also proved the effectiveness of using poplar trees for windbreaks. In 1953, Auvil was made the President of the Washington State Horticulture Association. Auvil was named the \"Grower of the Year\" in 1954. Auvil introduced to the market the \"Red Gold Nectarine\" in 1960. In 1967, Auvil came up with the practice and use of \"undertree sprinklers\" for the purpose of frost control. In 1968, Auvil established the \"Tree Fruit Commission\". In 1972, Auvil introduced the \"Granny Apple\" to the north western United States and in 1973 he had led the way in using the M26 rootstocks for practical use. In 1975, Auvil brought the \"Rainier Cherry\" to the north western United States and in the next year, he developed double row planting for Granny Smith apple trees.\n\nIn 1981, Auvil was named for the second time \"Grower of the Year\" on top of being awarded the \"Outstanding Citizen of the Year\" award by the Apple Blossom Festival. In 1986, the Washington State Cherry Commission honored Auvil the \"Cherry King\". In both 1989, Auvil had received the Gamma Sigma Delta \"Award of Merit\". To kick off the new decade in the 1990s, Auvil was named for the third time \"Grower of the Year\" in 1990. In 1998, Auvil was a recipient of the \"Washington State Medal of Merit\" awarded by the Washington State Legislature; the Medal of Merit is regarded as the State of Washington's highest honor of achievement that a citizen of Washington could be bestowed with.\n\nFor fifteen years, Auvil served on the Orondo Public School Board and for twenty years he had served on the Douglas County School Reorganizational Committee. For six years, Auvil had served as the Douglas County P.U.D. commissioner and member. Auvil also served on the Washington State University Tree Fruit Research Commission Scholarship Committee. For over fifty years, Auvil was a member of the Orondo Grange. His most valued hobbies were his rose and vegetable gardens. Auvil died on December 28, 1998, in the Central Washington Hospital. Auvil was survived by his one daughter and two sons; his wife Lillie died a few years after he did.\n\n"}

The parish lies in the upper reaches of both the Bewl stream before it enters Bewl Water and in the upper reaches of the River Rother flowing to the south-east. The parish includes the parish wards of Ticehurst, Flimwell and Stonegate. The linear settlements of Berner's Hill and Union Street lie between Ticehurst and Flimwell.\nIt lies to the south-east of Tunbridge Wells, and is about ten miles (16 km) distant.\n\nTicehurst is not mentioned in the \"Domesday Book\"; the manor came into being in the 14th century. \"Pashley Manor\" is also mentioned at the same time, and is within the parish.\n\nThe village's name derives from Old English; there are two possible derivations. The most plausible one is that it means \"wood on the Teise\" from the river; the second roughly translates as 'The wooded hill where young goats graze', \"ticce(n) + hyrst\". (1248, Tycheherst)\n\nTicehurst is part of the electoral ward called Ticehurst and Etchingham. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 4,679.\n\nThere is an active village club, which runs regular social events, and a monthly newsletter \"News & Views\" is produced by a team of volunteers. The village school serves both Ticehurst and Flimwell. There is also a comprehensive website covering most of the activities in the community.\n\nTicehurst House Hospital (now part of the Priory Group) specialises in the treatment of psychiatric disorders and is located in the village. Samuel Newington opened the original Ticehurst House in 1792 as a place dedicated to the care and treatment of psychiatric illness.\n\nFrom 1974 to July 2018 the village was home to the headquarters of the Antiquarian Horological Society, at New House, on the square.\n\nThe village is also home to the first \"pick-your-own fruit\" farm to open in Britain, Maynard's Fruit Farm, made \"The Times\" \"Top 50 places to eat outside in Britain\" list. Outside the village there are dairies at Northiam and Stonegate, a bakery at Bodiam, family butcher in Etchingham, a smokery and two more pubs at Three Leg Cross and Dale Hill.\n\nOne claim to fame is that the Scottish singer/guitarist Bert Jansch lived in Ticehurst in the late 1960s and recorded tracks for his 1971 \"Rosemary Lane\" album at his house in the village. Ticehurst was also the final residence of Evelyn Waugh's first wife, Evelyn Nightingale. The village church, St Mary's, was the venue for the wedding of her son, the journalist and theatre critic Benedict Nightingale, to the author Anne Redmon.\n\nPashley Manor Gardens is promoted by the Historic Houses Association and by the Campaign to Protect Rural England. The gardens hold an annual tulip festival each spring. The event in 2016, between 22 April and 7 May, has 30,000 tulips, with over 100 varieties.\n\nThe village is linear in shape and is the largest of a group of settlements, some of which contain some large residential properties, to both west and east of the main road. Other settlements are Union Street and Dale Hill to the west, and Seacox Heath to the east. Including the surrounding woods and fields, Flimwell covers an area of approximately , of which only approximately 5% is built-up.\n\nSouth-east from Ticehurst and due north-east from Burwash, is a small settlement, Stonegate.\n\nIt came into being at the same time as the railway line from Tunbridge Wells. The station at Stonegate has hourly train services to London (Charing Cross and Cannon Street) and to Hastings.

Today, it operates approximately 31 active chapters and 1 colony and has approximately 28,000 initiated members.\n\nAlpha Kappa Lambda was founded on April 22, 1914, by a group of young men attending the University of California, Berkeley. Its birth, however, dates back to 1906 when a group of friends discussed the \"need of Christian men for a place to live and study that was within their (financial) means.\"\n\nAfter assisting in the cleanup of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, four students re-addressed their desire to organize a house club during a YMCA conference in Pacific Grove, California. They decided to form \"Los Amigos\" in 1907, a house club named from the Spanish translation of \"The Friends.\" Shortly after, seven more men joined Los Amigos. Reverend Gail Cleland, one of the original eleven members of Los Amigos, recalled, \"when we organized Los Amigos as a house club...house clubs and fraternities were dime a dozen. They came, they lived for a few months or a few years, then they went out of existence again. But Los Amigos did not go out of existence.\"\n\nThe motto of the fraternity is \"Alítheia Kai Logos,\" which in Classical Greek means \"The Truth and the Word\".\n\nThe official badge of the fraternity is made of ten carat gold. An alpha and a lambda rest in the background (covered with the flowers of a dogwood, representing Christian principles) and the Kappa is raised, set with eleven whole pearls. The pearls represent the eleven founders of the Los Amigos Club. The badge is to be worn only on collared shirts, sweaters, or suit vests, and in the traditional position over the heart. It may only be worn by initiated members of the fraternity.\n\nAlpha Kappa Lambda realizes that sexual assault is a serious problem on college campuses and believes that it can be fought through education, service, and philanthropic projects. The philanthropic fundraising aspect is the most visible of the three. The fundraising is performed via a \"Promise Wall\" displayed prominently in a high traffic area of campus. Students, faculty, and members of the community are asked to add their \"hand\" to the Promise Wall for a contribution of $1. By placing their \"hand\" on the wall they make a promise that their hand will not be used to harm others. These Hands Don't Hurt was started in ΑΚΛ by the Beta Zeta chapter (East Tennessee State University) in 1995. In the spirit of \"growing the movement\" Alpha Kappa Lambda has allowed other student organizations from around the country to use the program as a way to raise awareness about domestic violence.\n\nThe fraternity adopted cystic fibrosis as a national philanthropy at the 1990 National Conclave. Chapters support the fight against cystic fibrosis in many ways. chapter fundraisers provide financial support to local organizations, research, and individuals. chapters provide manpower to help local organizations' events. Members can have holiday or birthday parties for children suffering from CF. There are countless ways to touch the lives of CF sufferers and their families.\n\nThe Adopt-A-School program was endorsed by the National Executive Council during their 1994 Winter meeting. The goal of the program is to provide for the formation of one-on-one relationships between local college students and local elementary students. This program provides an opportunity for college students to give something back to their host communities while devoting time and energy to being a role model for children.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2195217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195217", "title": "Gopher", "text": "Gopher\n\nPocket gophers, commonly referred to as just gophers, are burrowing rodents of the family Geomyidae. There are about 35 species, all endemic to North and Central America. They are commonly known for their extensive tunneling activities and their ability to destroy farms and gardens.\n\nThe name \"pocket gopher\" on its own may refer to any of a number of genera within the Geomyidae family. These are the \"true\" gophers, but several ground squirrels in the distantly related Sciuridae family are often called \"gophers\", as well. The origin of the word 'gopher' is uncertain; French \"gaufre\", meaning 'waffle', has been suggested, on account of the gopher tunnels resembling the honeycomb-like pattern of holes in a waffle; another suggestion is that the word is of Muskogean origin.\n\nGophers weigh around , and are about in body length, with a tail long. A few species reach weights approaching . Within any species, the males are larger than the females and can be nearly double their weight.\n\nAverage lifespans are one to three years. The maximum lifespan for the pocket gopher is about five years. Some gophers, such as those in the genus \"Geomys\", have lifespans that have been documented as up to seven years in the wild.\n\nMost gophers have brown fur that often closely matches the color of the soil in which they live. Their most characteristic features are their large cheek pouches, from which the word \"pocket\" in their name derives. These pouches are fur-lined, can be turned inside out, and extend from the side of the mouth well back onto the shoulders. Gophers have small eyes and a short, hairy tail, which they use to feel around tunnels when they walk backwards.\n\nPocket gophers have often been found to carry external parasites. Common predators of the gopher include weasels, snakes, and hawks.\n\nAll pocket gophers create a network of tunnel systems that provide protection and a means of collecting food. They are larder hoarders, and their cheek pouches are used for transporting food back to their burrows. Gophers can collect large hoards. Unlike ground squirrels, gophers do not live in large communities and seldom find themselves above ground. Tunnel entrances can be identified by small piles of loose soil covering the opening. Burrows are in many areas where the soil is softer and easily tunneled. Gophers often visit vegetable gardens, lawns, or farms, as gophers like moist soil (see Soil biomantle). This has led to their frequent treatment as pests.\n\nGophers eat plant roots, shrubs, and other vegetables such as carrots, lettuce, radishes, and any other vegetables with juice. Some species are considered agricultural pests. The resulting destruction of plant life then leaves the area a stretch of denuded soil. At the same time, the soil disturbance created by turning it over can lead to the early establishment of ecological succession in communities of r-selected and other ruderal plant species. The stashing and subsequent decomposition of plant material in the gophers' larder can produce deep fertilization of the soil.\n\nPocket gophers are solitary outside of the breeding season, aggressively maintaining territories that vary in size depending on the resources available. Males and females may share some burrows and nesting chambers if their territories border each other, but in general, each pocket gopher inhabits its own individual tunnel system. Although they attempt to flee when threatened, they may attack other animals, including cats and humans, and can inflict serious bites with their long, sharp teeth.\n\nDepending on the species and local conditions, pocket gophers may have a specific annual breeding season, or may breed repeatedly through the year. Each litter typically consists of two to five young, although this may be much higher in some species. The young are born blind and helpless, and are weaned around 40 days old.\n\n\"Geomys\" and \"Thomomys\" species are classed as \"prohibited new organisms\" under New Zealand's Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, preventing them from being imported into the country.\n\nMuch debate exists among taxonomists about which races of pocket gophers should be recognized as full species, and the following list cannot be regarded as definitive.\n\n\nSome sources also list a genus \"Hypogeomys\", with one species, but this genus name is normally used for the Malagasy giant rat, which belongs to the family Nesomyidae.\n\n\n\n"}

The purpose is to cluster students of similar capabilities and needs with teachers who can challenge them with greater academic and intellectual rigor while meeting their social and emotional needs. These relatively small programs are housed on larger campuses. In a \"Los Angeles Times\" review that separated Magnet test scores from their host schools, HGMs consistently had the highest standardized test scores of all LAUSD schools. \n\nDespite their high scores, highly gifted children are especially vulnerable to so-called risks of giftedness, such as social isolation, de-motivation, low self-esteem, and deliberate underachievement. Research has shown that highly gifted children are different not only because of higher IQ scores, but that there are cognitive differences in the ways that they think, learn, and relate to others. HGM schools bring together specialized teachers and compatible peers to give these children the challenge and support they need to develop to their maximum potential.\n\nEligibility to most HGMs is restricted to students who test at least in the 99.5th percentile on an intellectual giftedness assessment conducted by an LAUSD psychologist (equivalent to IQ of 140+). Priority is given to students with 99.9%, officially \"Highly Gifted\" by LAUSD definition (IQ 145+). If there are openings remaining, students with 99.5%-99.8% (considered \"Highly Gifted Applicable\") can be admitted. Priority within the HG-Applicable group is not based on IQ score but rather on Magnet points. IQ testing and eligibility is determined by the LAUSD's GATE (Gifted and Talented) office. Parents may request an IQ test by contacting the GATE Coordinator at their LAUSD school, but would need to justify why they believe their children may be \"highly\" gifted, above normal levels of giftedness that can be identified by the OLSAT test (see next paragraph). Because the test needs to be administered by visiting psychologist and because of staff reductions, the request could take months and much persistence. Receiving test scores by mail could take many more months, though parents may be able to call the GATE Department (213-241-6500) earlier to get verbal confirmation on whether their child is eligible (not the score).\n\nBeginning in 2011, all LAUSD second graders were given the OLSAT, an \"ability test\" (not IQ test) which may qualify students for regular Gifted/High \"Ability\" programs but NOT for Highly \"Gifted\" programs. If parents believe the OLSAT does not adequately reflect their child's intellectual capacity or that they need the higher challenge and social clustering of a Highly Gifted program, they can still request an IQ/intellectual assessment by contacting the GATE Coordinator at their school.\n\nStudents must be currently enrolled in a LAUSD school to be eligible for LAUSD-administered testing. Students in LAUSD-affiliated charter schools are also eligible for testing but the school needs to pay LAUSD $75 per test because the school already received funds that would normally be allocated to LAUSD's GATE program. In all cases, families will need to justify why they believe their children may be \"highly\" gifted, above normal levels of giftedness that can be identified by the OLSAT test (see above paragraph).\n\nAdmission is usually through online eCHOICES Magnet applications, which are open around October-November for admission the following September. Students must already have been tested and officially identified as eligible for their application to go through. Eligible students might also enroll during the school year if the HGM has openings. To do this, parents must contact the Magnet Coordinator at the HGM school. \n\nBecause these are unusual programs in their curriculum, pedagogy and community, HGM schools highly recommend touring their classes before applying. \n\nSchool bus transportation is available for students who live a certain distance from campus. Many students commute from great distances to attend HGM schools.\n\nElementary:\n\nMiddle School:\n\nHigh School:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2195232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195232", "title": "Fort Delaware", "text": "Fort Delaware\n\nFort Delaware is a former harbor defense facility, designed by chief engineer Joseph Gilbert Totten and located on Pea Patch Island in the Delaware River. During the American Civil War, the Union used Fort Delaware as a prison for Confederate prisoners of war, political prisoners, federal convicts, and privateer officers. A three-gun concrete battery of 12-inch guns, later named Battery Torbert, was designed by Maj. Charles W. Raymond and built inside the fort in the 1890s. By 1900, the fort was part of a three fort concept, the first forts of the Coast Defenses of the Delaware, working closely with Fort Mott in Pennsville, New Jersey and Fort DuPont in Delaware City, Delaware. The fort and the island currently belong to the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) and encompass a living history museum, located in Fort Delaware State Park.\n\nIn 1794, the French military engineer Pierre Charles L’Enfant was surveying for defensive sites. He identified an island that he called \"Pip Ash\" as an ideal site for the defense of the prize of American commerce and culture. The island that L'Enfant called Pip Ash was locally known as Pea Patch Island. This island was mostly unaffected by humanity with one exception. Dr. Henry Gale, a New Jersey resident, used Pea Patch as a private hunting ground. Gale was offered $30,000 for the island by the US Army, but he refused. The military was determined to get the island, so they appealed to the state of Delaware, which claimed ownership of the entire Delaware River and all islands therein within a twelve mile circle around New Castle's Court House. The state legislature passed an act in May 1813 ceding the island to the United States government, which subsequently seized it from Gale. In 1820, seeking to resolve questions surrounding the ownership of the island, Secretary of War John C. Calhoun requested a legal opinion from Attorney General William Wirt. Wirt's conclusion, based on a report by George Read, Jr. and former Attorney General Caesar A. Rodney was that the state of Delaware had the valid claim to the island, and so New Jersey could not have properly deeded it to Gale.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, efforts were made to fortify Pea Patch Island. This plan of defense was largely coordinated by Capt. Samuel Babcock, who was working nearby on similar defenses in Philadelphia. During this time a seawall and dykes were built around the island. There is no known evidence that any progress was made on the actual fortification by war's end. The original plan was to build a Martello tower on the island. One source states that an earthwork fort was built on the island during the war and torn down in 1821; also, a wooden fort existed from 1814 to 1824.\n\nConstruction of a star fort on Pea Patch island began sometime before December 8, 1817. Chief Engineer Joseph Gardner Swift mentions a fort on the \"Pea Patch in Delaware River\" among forts that are progressing nicely.\n\nThe attack on Fort Mifflin during the Revolutionary War proved that a fort was needed further away from Philadelphia in order to delay possible invaders. A fortification further downriver would also provide protection for other vital port cities such as Chester, Marcus Hook, Wilmington, and New Castle. On February 7, 1821, the Board of Engineers reported: \"In the Delaware, the fort on the Pea Patch island, and one on the Delaware shore opposite, defend the water passage as far below Philadelphia as localities will permit: They force an enemy to land forty miles below the city to attack it by land, and thus afford time for the arrival of succors [...] The two projected forts will also have the advantages of covering the canal destined to connect the Chesapeake with the Delaware[.]\" The fort on the Delaware shore was not built until the Civil War.\n\nThe star fort was designed by army engineer Joseph G. Totten and construction was supervised by Capt. Samuel Babcock. The five-pointed star design is viewed as \"transitional\" between the second and third systems of US fortifications. The fort was designed in 1815 and construction began within a few years. Babcock supervised the work from about August 1819 until August 20, 1824. Lt. Henry Brewerton was also on site, serving as an assistant engineer during the construction. Completion of the project was delayed years past the proposed date due to uneven settling, improper pile placement and the island's marshy nature. In one occurrence an entire section of 43,000 bricks had to be taken down, cleaned, and reworked due to massive cracking. In 1822, Colonel Totten and General Simon Bernard were on the island to inspect the faulty works. Captain Babcock was severely criticized for altering Totten's plans without orders. Babcock subsequently appeared before a court-martial for his actions in late 1824. It was determined he was not guilty of neglect but rather error in judgement and he was acquitted. During the trial his counsel was George Read Jr. of New Castle, Del.\n\nFort Delaware's first documented commander was Maj. Alexander C.W. Fanning, who took command prior to 1825. That year, a letter documenting a lost mail shipment was written by him as post commander. Army records document that the fort was manned by soldiers of the 2nd U.S. Artillery. Circa 1829, Major Benjamin Kendrick Pierce took command of Fort Delaware. During his tenure, the fort was garrisoned by Companies A and B, 4th U.S. Artillery. Major Pierce was the older brother of the 14th President of the United States, Franklin Pierce.\n\nIn February 1831, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sent Lt. Stephen Tuttle to evaluate the foundation issue and offer possible solutions. On February 8, 1831, around 10:30 p.m, a fire originating in Lieutenant Tuttle's quarters destroyed much of the work, burning until the next morning. Maj. Pierce, the post commander, was granted orders to use the federal arsenal in New Castle, Del. as barracks for his two companies until \"Fort Delaware can be reoccupied.\" Captain Richard Delafield, Babcock's replacement, asked for $10,000 to tear down the remaining structure the following year. In 1833, Fort Delaware was torn down to make room for a new fortification. According to official records, the rubble from the star fort served to reinforce the seawall around the island. The sandstone remnants can still be seen today.\n\nCaptain Delafield designed the second version of Fort Delaware \"as a huge bastioned polygonal form to be built in masonry.\" Delafield desired his fort to be \"a marvel of military architecture on Pea Patch\", and the design was much larger than the star fort. In 1836, excavation work progressed on the north side of the island. Grillage timbers were driven into the island's soft mud to serve as a base for the foundation of Delafield's fort. In 1838, James Humphrey of New Jersey (a descendant of Dr. Henry Gale) sent legal representation to the island, claiming he had legal rights to the island. This began a decade-long legal battle over the island's ownership, which prevented Delafield's fort from being built. After conflicting opinions from two different circuit courts, President James K. Polk suggested an arbitrator resolve the disagreement, and Secretary of War William Marcy and Humphrey agreed. John Sergeant was appointed arbitrator, and in late 1847 heard arguments from the United States (represented by Senators John M. Clayton and James A. Bayard, Jr.) and Humphrey (represented by former Secretary of War John Eaton and former Secretary of the Treasury George M. Bibb). On January 15, 1848, he ruled that the island had belonged to the state of Delaware and therefore the title given to the United States government was valid. It appears no further work was done on this fort.\n\nThe present Fort Delaware was erected mainly between 1848 and 1860 as one of the larger forts of the third system of US fortifications. Although major construction was wrapped up before the Civil War, the post engineer did not declare the fort finished until 1868. Construction of the counterscarp wall, slate pavement, and \"hanging shutters and doors\" was still ongoing. The fort was designed by Army chief engineer Joseph G. Totten, and construction was supervised by Major John Sanders. Engineers in supporting roles included Captain George B. McClellan, Major John Newton, Lieutenant William Price Craighill, Lieutenant Montgomery C. Meigs and civilian engineer Edwin Muhlenbrach. The fort was about the size and location of the previous star fort. It was in the shape of an irregular pentagon, with five small bastions at the corners, called \"tower bastions\" by Totten. Four of the sides were seacoast fronts, with three tiers of cannon on each, two casemated tiers in the fort and one barbette tier on the roof. The irregular shape provided for more cannon on the east-facing fronts, where the deeper channel was. A total of 123 heavy cannon could be mounted on the seacoast fronts, with 15 more in the bastions. The long rear front was called a \"gorge wall\", with two tiers totaling 68 loopholes for muskets and a tier of 11 cannon on the roof. In the center of this wall was the sally port, the only entrance to or exit from the fort. Twenty short-range flank howitzers could be mounted in the bastions to defeat attacks on the curtain walls. Thus, the fort had positions for 169 cannon. The fort also had a moat, with a tide gate on a canal from the river to control the moat's level.\n\nConstruction of a deep foundation was necessary since the island's soils were of \"a compressible mud often forty feet deep; the level where sand was finally reached\". In 1849, Sanders' crews began using steam-powered pile drivers to place long piles (similar to modern telephone poles) in excavated areas to provide adequate support. In 1850 pile driving was complete; crews had driven 4,911 piles, reusing 1,095 piles from the Delafield fort. Because of the star fort's failed foundation, Totten and Sanders decided to evaluate the weight resistance before moving forward with construction. The engineers proposed a singular test consisting of 30 blows from an 8-foot height using an 800 pound weight. A total of 5,754 piles were tested and 2,955 failed more than one fifth of an inch. Roughly 1,700 piles were subsequently spliced and re-driven an additional 10 to 20 feet. The pile driving was finally complete in 1851 and the wooden grillage was the next layer constructed.\n\nThe fort is primarily composed of gneiss, granite, brick, and cement. Initially, the stone for the scarp wall was gneiss imported from Port Deposit, Maryland. In 1852, Major Sanders reported the gneiss was too hard for his stone masons and cutters to shape, slowing the progress of construction. After that, purchase records show granite was bought from John Leiper's quarry in nearby Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Leiper's granite was also used throughout for various items such as the steps for the circular stairways. Stone from Vinalhaven, Maine was used for the stairways' large platforms. A huge storm damaged the island's dyke and seawall in 1854. Due to the threat of high-tide waters, efforts were directed toward repairing the dyke and adjacent seawall, slowing progress on the stonework.\n\nMore than two million bricks were purchased from Wilmington, Del. and Philadelphia, Pa. for the scarp wall's interior. These bricks were used in construction of underground cisterns, casemates, powder magazines, soldier barracks, officer quarters, bread ovens and the fort's breast high wall. Masonry arches and vaults were used throughout the entire fort to equally distribute weight and to provide stability. Poured concrete was used as a layer above the vaults to offer counter resistance and to \"create a strong floor system\".\n\nOn July 29, 1858, Major Sanders died on the island due to \"complications of carbunculous boils\"; Lt. William Craighill replaced him until Maj. John Newton was able to assume the role of supervising engineer. In 1859, in official correspondence, Major Newton reported that the fort would be ready to arm and garrison by 1860. In 1861, before the war started, Capt. Augustus A. Gibson took command of the fort and a small garrison of only 20 regular army soldiers. Construction languished until the end of the Civil War; the garrison's focus was centered on mounting cannon inside the fort. In 1861, 20 columbiad guns were received and work to mount these guns quickly began. By 1862, another 17 guns were delivered. By 1866, approximately 156 guns were mounted in total, filling the fort's casemates and ramparts to capacity.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Fort Delaware went from protector to prison; a prisoner-of-war camp was established to house captured Confederates, convicted federal soldiers, and local political prisoners as well as privateers. The first prisoners were housed inside the fort in sealed off casemates, empty powder magazines, and two small rooms inside the sally port. In those small rooms, names of Confederates can still be seen carved into the brick. According to the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\", the island \"contained an average population of southern tourists, who came at the urgent invitation of Mr. Lincoln\". The first Confederate general to be housed at the fort was Brig. Gen. Johnston Pettigrew. During the war, a total of about a dozen generals were held within the fort as prisoners-of-war.\n\nIn 1862 and 1863, two separate phases of construction took place, building a \"barracks for enlisted prisoners of war\" that was known as the \"bull pen,\" said Pvt. Henry Robinson Berkeley a Confederate prisoner. Most of the Confederates captured at Gettysburg were imprisoned here. An L-shaped barracks building, using similar plans, was constructed for Union soldiers assigned as guards. A 600-bed hospital was also built around the same time and was designed by architect John McArthur Jr. of Philadelphia. \"These Barracks [sic] were common wooden sheds, affording accommodation for about ten thousand persons,\" wrote Lt. Francis W. Dawson, a Confederate POW captured in August 1862. \"The bunks were arranged in tiers of three, and into one of these I crawled. The next morning I was told that these Barracks were the quarters for the privates and non-commissioned officers, and that, by requesting it, I could be removed to the quarters for the officers, which were inside the Fort.\"\n\nThe first Confederate prisoner to die at Fort Delaware was Captain L. P. Halloway of the 27th Virginia Infantry. He was captured at Winchester, Va. on March 23, 1862, dying on April 9. Captain Halloway, a Freemason, was given a full Masonic funeral by Jackson Lodge in Delaware City. The funeral procession was led by fort's commander, Captain Augustus A. Gibson, from the town's lock on Clinton Street, and ended in the cemetery on Jefferson Street. According to church records, Halloway's body was reclaimed by his family after the war.\n\nBy August 1863, there were more than 11,000 prisoners on the island; by war’s end, it had held almost 33,000 men. The conditions were relatively decent, but about 2,500 prisoners died on Pea Patch Island. Statistically, the overall death rate for prisoners was about 7.6 percent. Half of the total number of deaths occurred during a smallpox epidemic in 1863. Inflammation of the lungs (243 deaths), various forms of diarrhea (315 deaths) and smallpox (272 deaths) were the leading killers amongst the prison population. About 215 prisoners died as a result of typhoid and/or malaria, according to records in the National Archives. Other causes of death include scurvy (70 deaths), pneumonia (61 deaths) and erysipelas (47 deaths). Five prisoners drowned, and seven died from gunshot wounds. During the war, 109 Union soldiers and about 40 civilians died on the island as well.\n\nMany of the Confederate prisoners and Union guards who died at the fort are buried in the nearby Finn's Point National Cemetery in Pennsville, New Jersey.\n\nBy 1863, enlisted men and junior officers (mostly lieutenants and captains) of the prison population were living in the wooden barracks on the northwest side of the island. These two classes of prisoners were separated by a tall fence complete with a catwalk for the guards. In 1864, the War Department ordered the rations to be cut in retaliation for the treatment of Northern soldiers in southern POW camps. Although prisoners were only receiving two small meals, they were allowed to purchase extra food from the sutler, and allowed to fish in the waterways on the island and in the Delaware River. Official records also show that prisoners at Fort Delaware received more \"care packages\" than any other POW camp in the country.\n\n\"Things here are not quite as bad as I expected to find them. They are, however, bad, hopeless and gloomy enough without any exaggeration,\" said Pvt. Henry Berkeley. \"We went into dinner about three o'clock, which consisted of three hardtack, a small piece of meat (about three bites) and a pint tin cup of bean soup. We only get two light meals a day.\"\n\n\"The mess-room is next to [Division] \"22\" and near \"the rear\". It is a long, dark room, having a long pine table, on which the food is placed in separate piles, either on a tin plate or on the uncovered greasy table, at meal hours, twice a day,\" said Capt. Robert E. Park, 12th Alabama Infantry Regiment. \"The fare consists of a slice of baker's bread, very often stale, with weak coffee, for breakfast, and a slice of bread and a piece of salt pork or salt beef, sometimes, alternating with boiled fresh beef and bean soup, for dinner. The beef is often tough and hard to masticate.\"\n\n\"There are several large ditches running across the island which are filled daily by the bay water and which furnish the water for washing,\" wrote Capt. William H. Burgwyn, 35th North Carolina Infantry. \"Our drinking water is brought from Brandywine Creek about ten miles [away].\"\n\nHigh-ranking Confederate officers and some political prisoners were housed in former laundress quarters and open-bay barrack rooms inside the fort. These prisoners were often afforded paroles of the island, access to more food, and allowed more freedoms than the outside prison population.\n\n\"By the kindness of Gen. Albin Francisco Schoepf (the fort's commandant), Cols. Morgan, Tucker, Coleman and myself were paroled to the Island\", said Col. William W. Ward, on March 24, 1864. Gen. M. Jeff Thompson, Gen. Robert B. Vance and the Cols of our command form a mess, and live very well. We give a negro woman $7.00 per week for cooking, $10.00 for washing.\"\n\nAlso living in the former laundress quarters was Reverend Isaac W. K. Handy of Portsmouth, Va., a political prisoner. \"Our supplies have, recently, been so abundant, that \"Commissary\" Tibbetts has appropriated [Room] No. 3 as a larder and pantry. We have been living upon hams, turkeys, chickens, tongues, jellies, pickles, butter, cheese, canned fruits, and jellies of various kinds, with all else that could be desired for comfortable and healthy diet,\" wrote Reverend Handy in 1864. He further notes, \"The only article regularly furnished by the Government commissary is bread. Each man gets a well baked loaf, every other day, which is quite sufficient in quantity.\"\n\n\"We were installed in a large barrack-room, which then contained seventy or eighty officers. The highest in rank was a Major Holliday,\" wrote Lt. Francis W. Dawson. \"Our room was dry, warn and well lighted, while the Barracks [outside of the fort] were cold, damp and dark. Our room had conveniences for washing [...], and there was plenty of water of a poor quality,\" said Dawson. \"We only left the room to march down into the mess-hall.\"\n\nIn late 1862, prisoners inside the fort were fed three meals a day instead of the usual two. \"For breakfast we had a cup of poor coffee without milk or sugar, and two small pieces of bad bread. For dinner we had a cup of greasy water misnamed soup, a piece of beef two inches square and a half inch thick, and two slices of bread. At supper the fare was the same as at breakfast. This was exceedingly light diet,\" wrote Lt. Francis Dawson. \"We contrived to make some additions to our diet by purchases at the Sutler's store.\"\n\nOn August 20, 1864, six hundred Confederate officers boarded the \"Crescent\" bound for Morris Island, S.C., \"for the purpose I believe of being placed under the fire of the Confederate batteries in retaliation for an equal number of Federal officers who have been placed in the city of Charleston, and are said to be exposed to the shelling of their own guns. I am glad of this move as it will be a diversion to the monotonous life led in prison,\" said Capt. Leon Jastremski of the 10th Louisiana Infantry. This group of prisoners was later known as the \"Immortal Six Hundred\".\n\n\"Aug. 20 - Am detailed to go to Charleston with the Rebel Officers. Was very busy in the forenoon hunting up shoes and packing up things,\" said Pvt. Alexander J. Hamilton, Pittsburgh Heavy Artillery. \"At 3 p.m. we fell in and marched up to the barracks and by 5 were on board the Crescent and under way. There are 35 of our boys and about 90 of the other two batteries and of Company C, 157th Ohio [Infantry].\"\n\n\"After long delay - all being ready - the guards took their places, and the command was given to march through the sally-port, to the west end of the \"bull-pen\",\" according to Reverend Isaac Handy. \"As the noble fellows marched out, I stood at the opening of the sally-port, as near by as the guards would allow, and until the very last man disappeared from the enclosure. 'Good-bye! Good-bye!' was uttered, time and again, as the files moved on; and I could do nothing but return farewells, as some one or more in every rank would wave the parting salutation.\"\n\nStarting in 1861, volunteer troops were sent to garrison Fort Delaware that included Collis' Zouaves d' Afrique, the 19th New York Volunteers, Mlotkowski's Independent Battery A, Young's Independent Battery G (Pittsburgh Heavy Artillery), 5th Delaware Infantry, 6th Delaware Infantry, 9th Delaware Infantry, 5th Maryland Infantry, 11th Maryland Infantry, 6th Massachusetts Militia, 157th Pennsylvania Infantry (Battalion), 201st Pennsylvania Infantry, 215th Pennsylvania, 157th Ohio Infantry, 196th Ohio Infantry, and Zouaves of the 165th New York Infantry. The fort was also used to organize and muster troops from Delaware. Ahl's Independent Battery of Heavy Artillery was organized at the fort on July 27, 1863 for garrison duty. Although listed as a Delaware unit, Ahl's Battery was composed of Confederate prisoners that took the oath of allegiance. The fort's artillery soldiers were responsible for manning the guard posts within the fort as well as serving on various duty positions on the island. Infantry troops were mainly responsible for manning guard posts along the seawall, which ran around the island. In August 1864, there were approximately 85 guard posts on the island that required about 255 men on each shift.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the fort was operated by a small garrison of the 4th U.S. Artillery. In the early 1870s, plans were made to modify the five bastions to support 15-inch Rodman guns. During the Civil War a ten-gun battery was built on the river's west bank near the later Fort DuPont; this was rebuilt as a 20-gun battery in the 1870s but not fully armed.\n\nIn October 1878, a massive hurricane struck the area causing considerable damage to structures outside the fort. The majority of buildings on the south side of the island were destroyed. The Trinity Chapel, built in 1863 by Confederate POWs, was partially destroyed in the storm. The chapel was subsequently used to store hay until totally demolished sometime after 1901.\n\nOn August 3, 1885, a tornado struck the island, destroying the post-war hospital and caused considerable damage to other structures. \"A storm took place here. We have had nothing like it since [October 1878] and a strong whirlwind with it, sweeping every thing before it, pulling trees out of the ground and carrying parts of the hospital all over the island and out on the river,\" wrote Ordnance Sergeant James Maxwell.\n\nSeveral years before the start of the war, in 1892, a mine control casemate was built on the northern tip of the island. This casemate was built semi-underground and then covered with dirt for concealment. This mining casemate served in conjunction with a one-story torpedo (mine storage) shed and a narrow-gauge railroad, which all supported water-tight mines that could be placed in the Delaware River as a defensive measure against a possible enemy attack. Another casemate at Fort DuPont was built for a mine field controlled by that fort. A similar mine casemate at Fort Delaware had been planned in the 1870s but never materialized due to lack of funding.\n\nDuring the late 1890s new gun batteries were constructed at Fort Delaware. These batteries were part of a program initiated by the 1885 Board of Fortifications, a government board headed by Secretary of War William C. Endicott; the resulting system of fortifications is often called the Endicott program. Instead of many guns concentrated in a traditional thick-walled masonry structure, the Endicott batteries are spread out over a wide area, concealed behind concrete parapets flush with the surrounding terrain. As part of this program, Fort Delaware was supplemented by Fort DuPont on the river's west bank and Fort Mott on the east bank; these were the first forts of the Coast Defenses of the Delaware. Both of these were built new for the Endicott program, in both cases replacing earlier batteries. Part of an unfinished battery at Fort Mott from the 1870s was used for new batteries at that fort.\n\nIn 1896, half of the soldier barracks and a set of officers' quarters were demolished inside the fort. The parade ground was excavated and thousands of piles were steam driven, to support a foundation for a concrete three-gun battery as a way to modernize the defenses protecting ports along the Delaware River. Construction halted for a brief period before resuming in August 1897. This main battery was designed by Army engineer Lt. Col. Charles W. Raymond, assisted by Lt. Spencer Cosby. The new Endicott structure was a three-story reinforced concrete emplacement, which was built from 1894 to 1900 to support three 12-inch breech-loading rifled guns on disappearing carriages. These guns, mounted in 1900, had a range of approximately 10 miles. The three-gun battery, later named Battery Torbert after Maj. Gen. Alfred Torbert, is one of two three-story Endicott batteries in the United States, the other being Battery Potter, with unique gun-lift carriages, at Fort Hancock, New Jersey. The unusual height of Battery Torbert was due to being initially designed for gun-lift carriages. On top of the fort, flanking the 12-inch battery, were two smaller rapid-fire batteries, which protected the short-range sectors around the island and the mine field. These positions were later named Battery Allen and Battery Alburtis, and were armed with two 3-inch M1898 guns on retractable masking parapet mounts each. They were built in 1899 and accepted for service in 1901. Outside of the fort, engineers built additional rapid-fire batteries, which were later named Battery Dodd and Battery Hentig. Battery Dodd was added as an emergency measure after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898. It had two 4.7-inch 40 caliber guns purchased from the United Kingdom; at that point few of the Endicott batteries were complete and it was feared the Spanish fleet would bombard the US east coast. The battery was completed in 1899, after the war was over. Battery Hentig had two 3-inch M1903 guns and entered service in 1901.\n\nBattery Allen was named for Robert Allen, Jr., a cavalry officer who died at Gaines Mill in the Civil War. Battery Alburtis was named for William Alburtis, killed in the siege of Veracruz in the Mexican–American War. Battery Dodd was named for Captain Albert Dodd, also killed at Gaines Mill. Battery Hentig was named for Edmund C. Hentig, a cavalry officer killed fighting Native Americans at Cibiou Creek, Arizona in 1881.\n\nDuring the Spanish–American War, the fort was garrisoned by artillery soldiers of the 4th U.S. Artillery and volunteers from Company I of the 14th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Names of soldiers from the 14th P.V.I. appear today, carved on the brick walls inside the fort. These soldiers were stationed on the island during the summer of 1898.\n\nFollowing a period of caretaking status, the fort was garrisoned for a brief time during World War I. Nearby Fort DuPont was the main defense site, with Fort Delaware and Fort Mott serving as a sub-posts, according to army records. In March 1919, soldiers began the process of mothballing the old fort, removing everything except items pertaining to the three 12-inch guns of Battery Torbert, according to Pvt. James C. Davis, a Fort DuPont soldier who worked on the detail. In a \"Newark Post\" article, he recalls his orders were to bury everything with explicit orders not to throw anything in the river or remove articles from the island. According to Davis, soldiers buried three pieces of artillery on the island. Only one gun has since been recovered; a 15-inch Rodman gun exhumed from the northwest bastion was sold for scrap during World War II. The 4.7-inch guns of Battery Dodd were sent to San Francisco for use on Army troop transports; they were returned to Fort Delaware in 1919 but were soon removed from service and used as war memorials. In 1920 the 3-inch guns of Battery Alburtis and Battery Allen were scrapped as part of a general removal of M1898 3-inch guns from service. By the end of the First World War, Fort Saulsbury near Slaughter Beach, Del. was near completion, and with 12-inch guns on long-range carriages reduced the three upriver forts to secondary lines of defense. The Harbor Defenses of the Delaware were one of the most extreme examples of gun batteries being built seaward as gun ranges increased.\n\nIn 1940 Fort Delaware lost its three 12-inch guns, two of which were used to arm Battery Reed, Fort Amezquita in the Harbor Defenses of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the island was garrisoned by a detachment of soldiers from Battery C, 261st Coast Artillery Battalion, a unit from the Delaware Army National Guard. Battery C manned the two rapid-fire guns of Battery Hentig, located outside of the fort. These guns were removed in 1942 for use at Fort Miles in Lewes, Del., leaving Fort Delaware unarmed. Fort Miles, on the Atlantic Ocean south of Cape May, itself reduced Fort Saulsbury to a secondary line of defense. The fort was eventually stripped of the most of its electrical wiring, which was re-used at Fort Miles. Fort Delaware was declared as a surplus site by the federal government at the end of the war.\n\nDelaware acquired the fort from the United States government in 1947 after the federal government declared it a surplus site. Today, Fort Delaware State Park encompasses all of Pea Patch Island, including the Fort. As of 2018, transportation to Fort Delaware from Delaware City and Fort Mott is provided by a seasonal passenger ferry, the Forts Ferry Crossing. Once at the island, visitors are brought to the fort on a jitney. Tours and special programs are available to visitors. For example, visitors may see the 8 inch Columbiad gun, which is located on the northwest bastion, fired daily. Park staff and volunteers interpret the roles of people who were at the fort during the Civil War.\n\nBeach erosion affecting Pea Patch Island was recognized as a potential threat to the Fort in 1999. The United States Army Corps of Engineers erected a 3,500-foot-long seawall during the Winter of 2005-2006 which now protects the historical fort site and a migratory bird rookery, considered to be the largest such habitat north of Florida.\n\nEach year in the second week of June, there is an \"Escape from Fort Delaware\" triathlon, where entrants follow in the footsteps of the 52 escapees from the Civil War prison. A boat shuttles the athletes out to Fort Delaware, a Civil War historical interpreter fires a musket to start the race, the swimmers jump into the Delaware River, and swim back to land and then do the bike and run events, finishing on the town green in Delaware City, Delaware.\n\nStarting in 2009, Fort Delaware has hosted at least one game each summer of the Diamond State Base Ball Club, a vintage base ball team. The Diamond State Base Ball Club also typically plays 4-6 games per year at nearby Fort DuPont. The Diamond State Base Ball Club is a non-profit amateur organization created for the purposes of providing physical fitness to its members, educating the public on the history of baseball and local history, and serving as a point of public pride.\n\nThe A&E Network's \"Civil War Journal\" recorded portions of an episode at the fort entitled \"War Crimes: The Death Camps\" that originally aired October 9, 1994.\n\nThe Sci-Fi Channel investigation series \"Ghost Hunters\" conducted two cases there including a live televised investigation on Halloween in 2008.\n\nThe Sci Fi Channel investigation series \"Ghost Hunters Academy\" recorded an episode, which aired June 23, 2010.\n\nThe British series \"Most Haunted\" also did an investigation of the fort in their 11th series of the show.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Pool Re pays a premium to the Government for this guarantee and would repay the money over time if it ever used this facility.\n\nIn the event of a loss resulting from an act of terrorism, each member must first pay losses up to a threshold that is determined individually for each insurer. If losses exceed that threshold, the insurer can claim upon Pool Re’s reserves. These reserves have been accumulated by the members of Pool Re since its inception. It is only in the event that these reserves are exhausted that Pool Re would draw upon Government support.\n\nPool Re was established following a series of terrorist incidents in the early 1990s in London and elsewhere in England related to the situation in Northern Ireland at that time. The cost of these losses caused insurers and reinsurers to consider ceasing to provide terrorism cover for commercial properties because of the high potential cost of losses and the lack of any reliable method of estimating what the future loss experience might be. Insurers depend on reinsurers for financial protection when very large claims occur and, accordingly, both insurers and reinsurers decided they could no longer provide terrorism cover using traditional methods. A withdrawal of terrorism insurance that left areas of business unprotected would potentially have had serious consequences for the UK economy. It became necessary, therefore, to devise a new mechanism for providing this type of cover, without leaving insurers or reinsurers open to substantial losses for which there was no reliable method of calculating accurate premiums.\n\nDuring the latter part of 1992 it became clear that any new scheme would require the joint involvement of the insurance industry and government. Following extensive dialogue, a suitable structure emerged and the details of the Pool Re scheme were developed. The Pool Re scheme began operations in 1993 and has subsequently been involved in claims arising from thirteen separate terrorism incidents covering losses of over £600 million.\n\nSince its inception, the scheme has adapted to changing circumstances in the insurance market. The most significant changes occurred after the attacks in America on September 11th 2001, which caused insurers and reinsurers to reconsider the way terrorism coverage should be offered. Until that date the conventional insurance and reinsurance market had been willing to dovetail the cover they provided with that available from the Pool Re scheme. Pool Re’s cover to insurers was restricted to damage caused by acts involving fire or explosion, and the international reinsurance market covered other types of terrorism. After 9/11, however, reinsurers were no longer in a position to do so. Had Pool Re continued with these restrictions, insurers would have been unable to provide their customers with cover for terrorist events not involving fire or explosion. In an attempt to avoid this situation, there were discussions between representatives of the insurance industry, buyers of insurance, the UK government, Pool Re and others. In July 2002 an agreement was reached to widen cover and amend certain other features of the scheme in a way that responded to these changing needs. In particular, Pool Re’s cover was extended to an “all risks” basis, and no longer restricted to fire or explosion. In addition, exclusions relating to chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) attack were removed. Risks related to war and cyber threats are still excluded until April 2018.\n\nOn November 15, 2017 Steve Coates the Chief Underwriter for Pool Re announced wider cover, which now includes cyber-terrorism, and will be available from April 2018. The scope of our cover is designed to protect commercial property and will be offered as standard to all policyholders buying terrorism insurance from a Pool Re Member. \n\n\"The cover is effectively Material Damage and direct Business Interruption (BI), so BI flows only from events happening at the policyholder’s premises. We will not be providing cover for intangible assets, specifically Money and Data, which are more appropriately covered by the cyber market.\"\n\n\n"}

He hosted a two-hour weekday talk show, \"The Glenn Mitchell Show\", from 12 to 2 p.m. CST on NPR-member public radio station KERA 90.1 from 1995 to 2005.\n\nMitchell interviewed a wide variety of guests on an even wider variety of subjects, showing a thirst for knowledge and an unusual skill at making his audience a part of the conversation. Shortly before his death he was praised by guest Mike Wallace, the CBS veteran reporter. Wallace noted that Mitchell was well known for being an extraordinary interviewer. Mitchell responded modestly, calling himself \"the man who did his homework.\"\n\nThe popular \"Anything You Ever Wanted to Know\" edition of the show aired during the first hour every Friday with the tag line \"All Questions Answered. All Knowledge Revealed.\" Listeners called or emailed questions and answers to those questions every Friday, making it an interactive radio program for the audience. Occasionally, Mitchell would broadcast live from the Dallas Public Library.

He stepped down on 9 November 2009 in favor of Saad Hariri, the late Rafik Hariri's son. He is the leader of the parliamentary group of the Future Movement.\n\nSanioura was born into a Sunni Muslim family in Sidon on 19 July 1943. He earned a master of arts degree in Business Administration from the American University of Beirut after attending the American School for Boys in Sidon.\n\nIn the 1970s, Sanioura worked for Citibank and taught at the American University of Beirut, his alma mater, and at the Lebanese University. He then joined the audit committee at Lebanon's Central Bank in 1977. In 1982, he was recruited by Rafik Hariri to help him manage and expand his business empire. Upon the end of Lebanon's Civil War, Hariri became Lebanon's Prime Minister. Hariri appointed Sanioura as Minister of Finance in his successive cabinets. Sanioura was the Chairman and Managing Director of Groupe Mediterranee which encompasses four Hariri-owned banks.\n\nFuad Siniora has strong ties with the international financial community. Strongly pro-business, he is considered a moderate partisan of free trade. He was a very close adviser to late Rafik Hariri and he is very close to his son Saad Hariri. He served as finance minister from 1992 to 1998 and again from 2000 to 2004 during which he was the architect of the national debt that climbed from US $2 billion to US $50 billion. Siniora was the main architect of the Paris II Conference in November 2002 which allowed Lebanon to get US $2.6 billion and the Paris III Conference in January 2007 which pledged 13 billion dollars to Lebanon. He was accused of corruption and mismanagement after Hariri's ousting in 1998, in what was mainly viewed as a conflict between Hariri and Syria, and a Syrian-orchestrated move to keep him in line. Siniora was cleared of all charges in 2003 by the parliament and the Judicial Court. In 2002, he abolished most of Lebanon's duty taxes and introduced a Value Added Tax.\n\nAfter the victory of the anti-Syrian opposition in parliamentary elections held in May and June 2005, Fuad Siniora was asked by President Lahoud on 30 June 2005 to form a government. He resigned from the chairmanship of Group Méditerranée (a banking holding controlled by the Hariri family). After laborious negotiations with the President and the different political forces, Siniora formed a government on 19 July 2005. It is the first government formed after the Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon and the first government to include members of the pro-Iranian militant group Hezbollah. In regard to Hezbollah, the Siniora cabinet's official stance in the Pre-Doha Government was that \"The government considers the resistance a natural and honest expression of the Lebanese people’s national rights to liberate their land and defend their honour against Israeli aggression and threats\".\n\nOn 12 July 2006, Hezbollah launched a deadly cross-border attack against Israel in response to a series of previous Israeli attacks on Southern Lebanon. Israel started the 33 Day Heavy Bombardment and Land Invasion on Lebanon, the war is also known as 2006 Lebanon War. On 27 July 2006, Siniora seeking to end the conflict, presented a seven-point Siniora Plan at a 15-nation conference in Rome. Siniora also called for an Arab League meeting in Beirut. During a televised address at the conference, he famously \"sobbed\" as he described the effects of the war on the Lebanese people. On 12 August 2006, Siniora cautiously welcomed the newly passed UNSCR 1701. The Lebanese Government even declared that unauthorised rocket launching towards Israel would constitute High Treason, as the Israelis \"would gain much propaganda\".\n\nOn 13 November 2006, Shiite ministers backed by Hezbollah and Amal resigned from Siniora's cabinet. This took place on the eve in which the Special Tribunal for Lebanon trying the murderers of Rafik Hariri was to be discussed in a cabinet meeting. Although the resigned ministers were only 6, nearly 40% of the Lebanese MPs are in the opposition.\n\nThe Lebanese opposition claimed that this resignation meant that the Siniora Government was not a legitimate one because it did not represent all religious groups in Lebanon, namely the Shiite Lebanese. According to the constitution, the government is legal as long as it has two-thirds of the ministers, and so the majority believed the Siniora government was still a totally legal cabinet. The opposition demanded an increase in opposition representation in the cabinet, sufficient to hold veto power over decision making, as their requirement for returning. The majority saw this as a Syrian-orchestrated move to block the establishment of the Hariri tribunal.\n\nOn 1 December 2006, the parliamentary minority, primarily the pro-Syrian parties of Amal, Hezbollah and the Free Patriotic Movement of Michael Aoun launched a campaign of street demonstrations with the goal of getting veto power in the government. The country was further put into paralysis when the opposition refused to attend the parliament and vote for a new president, after Emile Lahoud's Presidential term expired. This meant the Fuad Siniora was an acting president until the new president was voted in.\n\nThe demonstrations continued for 17 months until 7 May 2008 (which was a reply to 5 May 2008). The day is remembered by many Lebanese as the darkest day they had witnessed since the end of the Lebanese Civil War. Hizbollah, Amal, Syrian Social Nationalist Party, amongst others launched an armed strike against Beirut. The Rafik Hariri Intl. Airport, the Government's Grand Serail, and houses of Majority leaders, Saad Hariri and Walid Jumblatt, were all put under siege. Mount Lebanon was also attacked in the operation. Vengeance attacks broke out in other areas of Lebanon. It is thought that about 200 people died in the few days of fighting. The Beirut siege ended shortly after the Lebanese leaders met in Doha and agreed to what is referred to as the Doha Agreement. The agreement promised the minority veto power, led to the election of President Michel Suleiman, and a promise to the majority the weapons will no longer be used for internal political gains.\n\nSiniora is known for his interest in Arab literature and poetry. He also participates in the annual Global Baku Forum, and is a member of the Nizami Ganjavi International Center, a global policy think-tank composed primarily of current and former presidents and prime ministers, and has lately contributed an article \"Are there new possibilities for the Middle East?\" for its journal. \n\n\n"}

Sharrett began his career at the age of 12 in the Emmy Award-winning \"Our Town\", a 1977 television adaptation of the classic play \"Our Town\". On February 20, 1978, Sharrett guest starred on \"Little House on the Prairie\" on the episode entitled \"The Stranger\" about young Peter Lundstrom, who is expelled from his private school for petty theft, so his wealthy father sends the boy to stay with Uncle Nels Oleson in Walnut Grove for a long-overdue lesson in values. At first he rebels but later on learns the pride of hard work and in time his father later realizes that his time with his son is much more important than making any more money as he is already quite wealthy already.

Based on the absence of birth or baptism records for Wood (with such an absence often considered to be indicative of royal descent), subsequent generations of the Wood family had a tradition that claimed that the infant Wood was given by the Prince to his former servant, Robert Wood senior. Exactly when Robert Wood and his parentage became the subject of such speculation is unclear, but the only source appears to have been the family itself.\n\nWood was in fact the biological son of the aforementioned Robert Wood, who was a servant to the Prince when he went to Quebec in 1791. Robert Wood senior married, in December of that year, Marie Dupuis (also known as Marie Caton). Subsequently appointed doorkeeper of the Executive Council, and later a merchant, he died in 1806, survived by seven children, Robert junior being the eldest.\n\nBy 1812, Wood was commissioned culler of timber, and by 1815 master culler and measurer of masts and timber. He and his brother George started their own business as timber merchants and carpenters; the business flourished and floundered on the vicissitudes of the timber market, and Wood was bankrupted in 1826, only to recover (building a large house at Anse St Michel, Sillery) by 1829. \n\nAt some time around the end of 1846 or early 1847, Wood visited the West Indies to benefit his health; this failed to do any good, and he died in April of that year. He was survived by his wife, Charlotte (née Gray), daughter of a military clerk, whom he had married in 1817 and with whom he had eleven children.\n\n"}

The school was built to accommodate the children of United Nations (UN) employees and diplomats when the UN decided to locate one of its offices in Vienna (at the Vienna International Centre), and it remains affiliated to the UN. About 50% of students are children of UN employees and receive education grants, while much of the remaining students are children mainly of embassy staff and company staff. The school has an enrollment of 1700 students, from pre-primary to twelfth grade.\n\nThe first English language medium school in Vienna was set up in August 1955 as the International Community School. Previously, it had been the 'British Army School' in Schönbrunn barracks and catered for the children of the British occupying forces in Vienna. The Austrian State Treaty signed in May 1955 resulted in the occupying forces leaving Austria, so the school transformed into the International Community School under the patronage of the British, American and Indian Missions.\n\nIt opened on 1 September 1955 in the 18th district of Vienna. By the end of the year, 150 students between the ages of 3 and 15 years attended the International Community School. Soon the building proved too small for the expanding school, which moved into the 19th district. By 1959, 300 children represented 25 different nationalities in ICS. However, most of the children were American or Canadian, so the British and Indian Embassies started a separate British style school in 1959, the English School, while the ICS changed into the American International School.\n\nThe English School moved into Grinzinger Straße 95, a premises found with the help of the British Ambassador, Sir James Bowker, the legal advisor at the Embassy Walter Rhodes, and Vienna's Deputy Lord Mayor, Hans Mandl. The English School quickly expanded and was visited by the British Minister of Education in 1961. Some of the first staff of the International Atomic Energy Agency sent their children to the English School in 1959. The school year 1961-62 saw the introduction of William Kirk as director. In May 1969, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited the English School on a state visit to Vienna. In 1974, some families of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) started sending their children to the school.\n\nIn September 1977, Maurice Pezet was invited by the Austrian Government to start the project of developing a Vienna International School on the model of the Geneva and New York United Nations Schools in preparation for the expansion of the United Nations to Vienna. {Vienna is one of the four headquarters of the UN, along with New York, Geneva and Nairobi. The Vienna International Centre (UNO City) is leased to the United Nations for 1 Austrian schilling (7 euro cent) per year.} It was anticipated that there would be two years of preparation for the small existing English School to be incorporated into the school development plan for the Vienna International School (VIS).\n\nThe Vienna International School officially opened its doors on 11 September 1978 to pupils of 60 nationalities. Primary and Secondary were accommodated on Grinzingerstrasse and Kindergarten was located on Heiligenstädter Strasse. A part of Secondary moved briefly to Zollergasse and then Schloss Pötzleinsdorf. A year later, Secondary School moved to Peter-Jordan-Straße, where it remained until the custom built present campus was opened in September 1984 with Maurice Pezet as Director. The then Chancellor, Dr Bruno Kreisky had initiated the idea of a new, specially built school and the campus was entirely funded by the Austrian Government. Dr. Kreisky employed Maurice Pezet, formerly associated with the UN School in New York (UNIS), to manage the project and he became the first Director of the new Vienna International School. Dr. Kreisky was present at some of the opening events at the VIS. The new building was constructed in the 22nd District, two U-Bahn (underground) stops from the VIC, and opened in September 1984. It is located on Straße der Menschenrechte, two hundred metres away from the U1 Kagran underground station and the Donau Zentrum Shopping Mall.\n\nThe school is divided into 3 wings.

His social teachings became influential during the papacy of Leo XIII and his encyclical \"Rerum novarum\".\n\nKetteler was born in Münster in Westphalia. In 1828 he finished the Matura in Brig, Switzerland far away from his home. He studied theology at Göttingen, Berlin, Heidelberg and Munich, and was ordained priest in 1844. He resolved to consecrate his life to maintaining the cause of the freedom of the Church from the control of the State. This brought him into collision with the civil power, an attitude which he maintained throughout a stormy and eventful life.\n\nKetteler was rather a man of action than a scholar, and he first distinguished himself as the deputy for District of Tecklenburg and Warendorf at the Frankfurt National Assembly, a position to which he was elected in 1848, and in which he soon became noted for his decision, foresight, energy and eloquence.\n\nIn 1850 he was made bishop of Mainz, by order of the Vatican, in preference to the celebrated Professor Leopold Schmidt, of Gießen, whose Liberal sentiments were not agreeable to the Papal party. When elected, Ketteler refused to allow the students of theology in his diocese to attend lectures at Giessen, and ultimately founded an opposition seminary in the diocese of Mainz itself.\n\nHe also founded religious institutes of School Brothers and School Sisters, to work in the various educational agencies he had called into existence, and he labored to institute orphanages and rescue homes. In 1851, he founded the congregation of the Sisters of Divine Providence, with Stephanie Amelia Starkenfels de la Roche.\n\nHe died at Burghausen, Upper Bavaria in 1877.\n\nIn Mainz, \"Workers' Day\" is celebrated in honor of the Bishop. The Herz-Jesu-Kirche, Mainz was built in the honour of Ketteler. The fuchsia cultivar \"Baron de Ketteler\" is named after him. Ketteler's nephew, Klemens von Ketteler, was Germany's envoy in China and was murdered during the Boxer Rebellion.\n\nHe is cited in Pope Benedict's encyclical \"Deus caritas est\" for his role in the Catholic social tradition.\n\nIn 1861, Ketteler published a book on reconciliation between Catholics and Protestants in Germany, \"Freiheit, Autorität, und Kirche\"; in it, he proposed the founding of a prayer society \"for the Reunion of Christendom\". Ketteler was friends with Julie von Massow, a Lutheran woman from Prussian nobility, who indeed founded such a prayer society.\n\nIn 1858, Ketteler threw down the gauntlet against the State in his pamphlet on the rights of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. In 1863 he adopted Ferdinand Lassalle's views and published his \"Die Arbeitfrage und das Christenthum\".\n\nWhen the question of papal infallibility arose, he opposed the promulgation of the dogma on the ground that such promulgation was inopportune. But after the dogma was defined, he submitted to the decrees (in August 1870).\n\nHe was the warmest opponent of the State in the Kulturkampf provoked by Prince Otto von Bismarck after the publication of the Vatican decrees, and was largely instrumental in compelling that statesman to retract the pledge he had rashly given, never to \"go to Canossa.\"\n\nTo such an extent did Bishop von Ketteler carry his opposition, that in 1874 he forbade his clergy to take part in celebrating the anniversary of the Battle of Sedan, and declared the Rhine to be a \"Catholic river.\"\n\n"}

Three of the founding members, Ricky Warwick, Stump Monroe and Floyd London were friends who met at school. Although the band members musical roots were in punk, The Almighty adopted a more heavy metal/hard rock oriented musical direction in their early years. Later albums saw the band's musical style move towards the band members' original punk roots.\n\nThey have released seven studio albums, two anthologies and one live album.\n\nThe Almighty were formed in Strathaven, Scotland, on 19 January 1988. Most of the musicians came from a punk background. Lead singer Ricky Warwick had previously done some session and tour work with New Model Army, although not on any of their recordings. Ricky, drummer Stump Monroe and bass guitarist Floyd London were friends at school and had previously played together in a local band called Rough Charm. The three were joined by guitarist Andy 'Tantrum' McCafferty to complete the band line-up. Despite the band members largely punk rock roots, The Almighty followed a more heavy metal/hard rock oriented musical direction, and recorded an eight-track demo to help promote their early gigs.\n\nThey were signed by Polydor in March 1989 and recorded their first album, \"Blood, Fire and Love\" which was released in October to generally positive reviews. The band were also signed to a long-term songwriting agreement to Chrysalis Music, having been scouted by Dave Massey. In the same year they were voted in third place on the \"Kerrang!\" readers poll for Best New Act.\n\nIn 1990 they toured the UK and also embarked upon a short US tour in an attempt to break into the American market. However, a more extensive follow up tour of the US did not go ahead, although they did embark on a European club tour. The band's hard rock sound was compared favourably with the likes of The Cult, AC/DC and Motörhead in press reviews of their live shows. A live album, \"Blood, Fire and Live\", was released on 8 October 1990, having been recorded at July gigs in Edinburgh and Nottingham. The track list featured songs from \"Blood, Fire and Love\", plus a cover of Bachman–Turner Overdrive's \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\".\n\nRecording of The Almighty's second studio album, \"Soul Destruction\", began in December 1990 with Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor as producer. The album was released in March 1991 along with the lead single \"Free'n'Easy\". In February and March the band toured the UK supporting Motörhead and Megadeth. In June 1991 they embarked on a headline UK tour. The concert at the Town and Country club in London was filmed and released later that year on VHS as \"Soul Destruction - Live\". Later in the year they supported Alice Cooper on a European tour.\n\nIn March 1992 internal differences within the band came to a head causing guitarist Tantrum to leave the band. He was replaced by Canadian Pete Friesen who had previously played for Alice Cooper, and had met The Almighty when they played support for him the previous year. In the spring the band were invited to tour Australia in support of The Screaming Jets, who had just released their Living in England EP and wanted a British band for the support on their tour. That summer the band were the opening act at the Donington Monsters of Rock festival, and during their set played a new song entitled \"Addiction\". Towards the end of the year they began preparing material for a third album.\n\nIn April 1993 \"Powertrippin'\", their third album, was released, charting at Number 5. The album displayed Grunge influences, with Alice in Chains being a regular comparison in reviews. The Almighty embarked upon a European tour supporting Iron Maiden, their longest tour to date. This was followed with a support slot at that year's Milton Keynes Bowl festival, which substituted for Donington as the Monsters of Rock festival was not staged in 1993. In Autumn 93 they finally toured America, but failed to make the hoped-for impact. On their return they started a headline European tour, but had to abandon it after the first two London dates due to poor health. In November, The Almighty parted from manager Tommy Tee and moved to Sanctuary Records. At the same time they left Polydor and signed with Chrysalis. They were able to perform some replacement UK shows the same month, but were not able to tour Europe as planned.\n\nTheir fourth album, \"Crank\", was released on Chrysalis in late 1994. The album saw The Almighty's musical style shift towards the band members original punk roots. They appeared on Top of the Pops in support of the first single, \"Wrench\", which reached Number 26 in the UK singles chart. The second single from the album, \"Jonestown Mind\", also reached Number 26. In the autumn they toured the UK in support of the album and spent seven weeks in Europe supporting Pantera. The band returned to tour Europe as headliners in early 1995. In May they recorded four tracks for a proposed EP. However, the band decided that the tracks were good enough to form the basis for a fifth album. They therefore decided to arrange two more recording sessions during 1995, recording four tracks each time, so that they would have enough for an album release in 1996.\n\nTheir fifth album, \"Just Add Life\", was released in 1996, with the lead single \"All Sussed Out\" reaching Number 28 in the UK singles chart. However, various record company issues and frustrations with the music industry in general saw the band disband later that year.\n\nThe band reformed in 2000 and released the self-titled album \"The Almighty\", replacing guitarist Pete Friesen with Nick Parsons. A second album followed in 2001, \"Psycho-Narco\", with a new bass player Gav Gray who replaced longtime bassist Floyd London. The band disbanded again with vocalist Ricky Warwick pursuing a solo career.\n\nIn 2002 a compilation album, \"Wild and Wonderful\" was released, which included material from their three Polydor albums, along with covers of \"Bodies\", by the Sex Pistols, \"You Ain't Seen Nuthin Yet\" from \"Blood Fire and Live\" and \"Keep on Rocking in the Free World\" by Neil Young.\n\nThe classic lineup (Ricky, Stump, Floyd and Pete) reformed for benefit shows in January 2006 and then appeared at the 2006 Bulldog Bash. They undertook a short five show tour at the end of December 2006. In 2007, the band released their second compilation album, \"Anth F***in'Ology - the Gospel According to The Almighty\", covering their entire career and including a DVD of all their promo videos to date.\n\nA lengthier UK tour took place in January 2008 to mark the band's twentieth anniversary. It was announced on 17 January that the band would be recording footage with multiple cameras at various shows on the upcoming tour for a 20th Anniversary DVD. Ricky Warwick announced in an interview with Komodo Rock that there were plans to record a new album following the band's UK Tour. He said \"I would like to. ... I'm inspired again though, and I feel to me it might be time to turn round and make that definitive Almighty Album.\"\n\nIn November 2008, Floyd announced on the band's forum and MySpace pages that he had decided to leave the band. The Almighty have been on hiatus since then, aside from a one-off benefit gig in June 2009 for the family of former manager Tommy Tee who had died in December 2008. It was announced in December 2014 that the band's first two studio albums, \"Blood, Fire & Love\" and \"Soul Destruction\" were to be re-released in early 2015 with additional tracks and live recordings. Ricky Warwick commented about any possible future reunion, saying \"I certainly would be open to the idea of doing a few shows. I don’t know how the others feel about it. I love the guys and I love the songs. I would like to play them one day again because life is short and you just get one shot at it\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2195311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195311", "title": "Bassae", "text": "Bassae\n\nBassae (, - \"Bassai\", meaning \"little vale in the rocks\") is an archaeological site in Oichalia, a municipality in the northeastern part of Messenia, Greece. In classical antiquity, it was part of Arcadia. Bassae lies near the village of Skliros, northeast of Figaleia, south of Andritsaina and west of Megalopolis. It is famous for the well-preserved mid- to late-5th century BC Temple of Apollo Epicurius.\n\nAlthough this temple is geographically remote from major polities of ancient Greece, it is one of the most studied ancient Greek temples because of its multitude of unusual features. Bassae was the first Greek site to be inscribed on the World Heritage List (1986). \n\nThe temple was dedicated to Apollo Epikourios (\"Apollo the helper\"). It sits at an elevation of 1,131 metres above sea level on the slopes of Kotylion Mountain. Its construction is placed between 450 BC and 400 BC. It was supposedly designed by Iktinos, architect at Athens of the Parthenon. \n\nThe ancient writer Pausanias praises the temple as eclipsing all others but the Temple of Athena Alea at Tegea by the beauty of its stone and the harmony of its construction. \n\nPausanias described it in the 2nd century: \n\nIt was in use until the 4th- or 5th-century AD, when all pagan temples were forcibly closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. \nThe temple is aligned north-south, in contrast to the majority of Greek temples which are aligned east-west; its principal entrance is from the north. This was necessitated by the limited space available on the steep slopes of the mountain. To overcome this restriction a door was placed in the side of the temple, perhaps to let light in to illuminate the cult statue. \n\nThe temple is of a relatively modest size, with the stylobate measuring 38.3 by 14.5 metres containing a Doric peristyle of six by fifteen columns (hexastyle). The roof left a central space open to admit light and air. The temple was constructed entirely out of grey Arcadian limestone except for the Bassae Frieze which was carved from marble (probably in ancient times colored with paint). Like most major temples it has three \"rooms\" or porches: the \"pronaos\", plus a \"naos\" and an \"opisthodomos\". The \"naos\" may have housed a cult statue of Apollo, although it is also surmised that the single 'proto-Corinthian' capital discovered by Charles Robert Cockerell and subsequently lost at sea, may have topped the single column that stood in the centre of the naos, and have been intended as an aniconic representation of Apollo Borealis. The temple lacks some optical refinements found in the Parthenon, such as a subtly curved floor, though the columns have entasis. \nThe temple is unusual in that it has examples of all three of the classical orders used in ancient Greek architecture: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. Doric columns form the peristyle while Ionic columns support the interior and a single Corinthian column features in the centre of the interior. The Corinthian capital is the earliest example of the order found to date. \n\nIt was relatively sparsely decorated on the exterior. Inside, however, there was a continuous Ionic frieze showing Athenians in battle with Amazons and the Lapiths engaged in battle with Centaurs. This frieze's metopes were removed by Cockerell and taken to the British Museum in 1815 (they are still to be seen in the British Museum's Gallery 16, near the Elgin Marbles). Cockerell decorated the walls of the Ashmolean Museum's Great Staircase and that of the Travellers Club with plaster casts of the same frieze.\nThe temple had been noticed first in November 1765 by the French architect J. Bocher, who was building villas at Zante and came upon it quite by accident; he recognized it from its site, but when he returned for a second look, he was murdered by bandits. Charles Robert Cockerell and Carl Haller von Hallerstein, having secured sculptures at Aegina, hoped for more successes at Bassae in 1811; all Haller's careful drawings of the site were lost at sea, however. \n\nThe site was explored in 1812 with the permission of Veli Pasha, the Turkish commander of the Peloponnese, by a group of British antiquaries who removed 23 slabs from the Ionic cella frieze and transported them to Zante along with other sculptures. Veli Pasha's claims on the finds were silenced in exchange for a small bribe, and the frieze was bought at auction by the British Museum in 1815. This frieze's metopes were removed personally by Cockerell. The frieze sculptures were published in Rome in 1814 and officially, by the British Museum in 1820. Other hasty visits resulted in further publications. The first fully published excavation was not begun until 1836; it was carried out by Russian archaeologists, among which the painter Karl Bryullov. Perhaps the most striking discovery was the oldest Corinthian capital found to date. Some of the recovered artefacts are on display at the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow. \n\nIn 1902, a systematic excavation of the area was carried out by the Greek Archaeological Society of Athens under archaeologist Konstantinos Kourouniotis along with Konstantinos Romaios and Panagiotis Kavvadias. Further excavations were carried out in 1959, 1970 and from 1975–1979, under the direction of Nikolaos Gialouris.\n\nThe temple's remoteness— Pausanias is the only ancient traveller whose remarks on Bassae have survived— has worked to its advantage for its preservation. Other, more accessible temples were damaged or destroyed by war or preserved only by conversion to Christian uses; the Temple of Apollo escaped both these fates. Due to its distance from major metropolitan areas it also has less of a problem with acid rain which quickly dissolves limestone and damages marble carvings. \n\nThe temple of Apollo is presently covered in a white tent in order to protect the ruins from the elements. Conservation work is currently being carried out under the supervision of the Committee for the Conservation of the Temple of Apollo Epikourios of the Greek Ministry of Culture, which is based in Athens.\n\n\n"}

It dwells under rocks in limestone forest areas of the Korean peninsula. It was discovered by Stephen J. Karsen, an American science teacher working in Daejeon, South Korea, in 2003, and described in 2005. Although plethodontid salamanders comprise seventy percent of salamander species worldwide, \"Karsenia koreana\" is the first member of this taxon known from Asia. Like other plethodontids, it lacks lungs and breathes through its moist skin. It is the only species in the genus Karsenia.\n\nCladistic analysis using Bayesian analysis of molecular data places \"Karsenia koreana\" as sister group to the clade containing \"Aneides\" and the desmognathine salamanders. This implies that plethodontid salamanders may have had a worldwide range 60 to 100 million years ago. As the global climate cooled, New World taxa thrived while Old World populations declined. Other plants and animals currently found in Asia and North America share close relationships, showing a similar pattern of biogeography.\n\nMales measure and females in snout–vent length.

The tail is round basally but becomes in some individuals laterally compressed towards its tip. Complete tail (i.e., non-regenerated) is about as long as the snout–vent length. The species is darkly pigmented. There is a broad dorsal stripe of variable color (reddish to yellowish brown, tan, or dark brown) and distinctness (prominent and bright to obscure). The lateral surfaces are uniformly dark but have an obscure overlay of small, whitish speckles. The ventral surfaces are pale with moderately large, whitish flecks that are absent along the midline.\n\nThe species occurs in damp talus slopes and rockslides of limestone in young forests dominated by \"Pinus densiflora\" and \"Quercus mongolica\", mostly under small stones. Although the species is considered locally common, and reasonably widespread (as of 2006, it was known from more than 20 sites), it has not been well studied in the field. Thus, its natural history, population dynamics, and reproductive behavior remain unknown.\n"}

He played as an all-rounder and was known as an aggressive middle-order batsman and an effective medium pace bowler.\n\nWhittall born at Chipinga in what was then Rhodesia in 1972. The son of farmers, he was educated at Ruzawi School and then Falcon College where he captained the school cricket XI and played both hockey and rugby union. He was selected for the national schools cricket side aged 16 and toured New Zealand and England. The side was coached by former international David Houghton and they were unbeaten on both tours. His first Logan Cup century came for Zimbabwe Schools against Harare Central, although the tournament did not have first class status at the time.\n\nWhittall also played rugby for Zimbabwe schools, playing as a centre. He went on to play for the national side, including going as a squad member to the qualification tournament for the 1995 Rugby World Cup.\n\nHis first-class cricket debut came at the age of 18, playing for Young Zimbabwe. He first played for Zimbabwe against Worcestershire, opening the batting and was selected for the Zimbabwean team to tour England in 1993. Although he would not get a game in England, he was included in the side for the tour to Pakistan later the same year.\n\nWhittall made his Test debut in December against Pakistan, scoring 33 runs and taking the wicket of Basit Ali. He made his maiden Test century in his sixth Test, at Harare Sports Club in February 1995, making an unbeaten 113 to help his side to a historic first Test victory against the touring Pakistanis. Two years later he scored Zimbabwe's first double-century, making an unbeaten 203 at Queens Sports Club against New Zealand. Whittall was well short of his double ton when the number 11, Everton Matambanadzo, came in to bat. The New Zealanders did their bit to help, giving field placings designed to give easy singles thus giving Matambanadzo the strike.

It is an impairment in recognition or assigning meaning to a stimulus that is accurately perceived and not associated with a generalized deficit in intelligence, memory, language or attention. The disorder appears to be very uncommon in a \"pure\" or uncomplicated form and is usually accompanied by other complex neuropsychological problems due to the nature of the etiology. Afflicted individuals can accurately distinguish the object, as demonstrated by the ability to draw a picture of it or categorize accurately, yet they are unable to identify the object, its features or its functions.\n\nAgnosias are sensory modality specific, usually classified as visual, auditory, or tactile. Associative visual agnosia refers to a subtype of visual agnosia, which was labeled by Lissauer (1890), as an inability to connect the visual percept (mental representation of something being perceived through the senses) with its related semantic information stored in memory, such as, its name, use, and description. This is distinguished from the visual apperceptive form of visual agnosia, \"apperceptive visual agnosia\", which is an inability to produce a complete percept, and is associated with a failure in higher order perceptual processing where feature integration is impaired, though individual features can be distinguished. In reality, patients often fall between both distinctions, with some degree of perceptual disturbances exhibited in most cases, and in some cases, patients may be labeled as integrative agnostics when they fit the criteria for both forms. Associative visual agnosias are often category-specific, where recognition of particular categories of items are differentially impaired, which can affect selective classes of stimuli, larger generalized groups or multiple intersecting categories. For example, deficits in recognizing stimuli can be as specific as familiar human faces or as diffuse as living things or non-living things.\n\nAn agnosia that affects hearing, \"auditory sound agnosia\", is broken into subdivisions based on level of processing impaired, and a \"semantic-associative\" form is investigated within the auditory agnosias.\n\nAssociative visual agnosias are generally attributed to anterior left temporal lobe infarction (at the left inferior temporal gyrus), caused by ischemic stroke, head injury, cardiac arrest, brain tumour, brain hemorrhage, or demyelination. Environmental toxins and pathogens have also been implicated, such as, carbon monoxide poisoning or herpes encephalitis and infrequent developmental occurrences have been documented.\n\nMost cases have injury to the occipital and temporal lobes and the critical site of injury appears to be in the left occipito-temporal region, often with involvement of the splenium of the corpus callosum. The etiology of the cognitive impairment, as well the areas of the brain affected by lesions and stage of recovery are the primary determinants of the pattern of deficit. More generalized recognition impairments, such as, animate object deficits, are associated with diffuse hypoxic damage, like carbon monoxide poisoning; more selective deficits are correlated with more isolated damage due to focal stroke.\n\nDamage to the left hemisphere of the brain has been explicitly implicated in the associative form of visual agnosia. Goldberg suggested that the associative visual form of agnosia results from damage to the ventral stream of the brain, the occipito-temporal stream, which plays a key role in object recognition as the so-called \"what\" region of the brain, as opposed to the \"where,\" dorsal stream.\n\nTeuber described the associative agnostic as having a \"percept stripped of its meaning,\" because the afflicted individual cannot generate unique semantic information to identify the percept, since though it is fully formed, it fails to activate the semantic memory associated with the stimulus. Warrington (1975) offered that the problem lies in impaired access to generic engrams (memory traces) that describe categories of objects made up of a multitude of similar elements. Essentially, damage to a modality-specific meaning process (semantic system), is proposed, either in terms of defective access to or a degradation of semantic memory store for visual semantic representations themselves. The fact that agnosias are often restricted to impairments of particular types of stimuli, within distinct sensory modalities, suggests that there are separate modality specific pathways for the meaningful representation of objects and pictures, written material, familiar faces, and colors.\n\nCognitive psychology often conceptualizes this deficit as an impairment in the object recognition process. Currently visual agnosias are commonly explained in terms of cognitive models of object recognition or identification. The cognitive system for visual object identification is a hierarchal process, broken up into multiple steps of processing.\n\nIn the object recognition unit model by Marr (1980), the process begins with sensory perception (vision) of the object, which results in an initial representation via feature extraction of basic forms and shapes. This is followed by an integration stage, where elements of the visual field combine to form a visual percept image, the 'primary sketch'. This is a dimensional (D) stage with a 'viewer-centered' object representation, where the features and qualities of the object are presented from the viewer's perspective. The next stage is formation of a 3 dimensional (3D) 'object-centered' object representation, where the object's features and qualities are independent of any particular perspective. Impairment at this stage would be consistent with apperceptive agnosia. This fully formed percept then triggers activation of stored structural object knowledge for familiar things. This stage is referred to as \"object recognition units\" and distinctions between apperceptive and associative forms can be made based on presentation of a defect before or after this stage, respectively. This is the level at which one is proposed to perceive familiarity toward an object, which activates the semantic memory system, containing meaning information for objects, as well as descriptive information about individual items and object classes. The semantic system can then trigger name retrieval for the objects. A patient who is not impaired up until the level of naming, retaining access to meaning information, are distinguished from agnostics and labeled as anomic.\n\nIn an alternate model of object recognition by Carbonnel et al. episodic and semantic memory arise from the same memory traces, and no semantic representations are stored permanently in memory. By this view, the meaning of any stimulus emerges momentarily from reactivation of one's previous experiences with that entity. Each episode is made of several components of many different sensory modalities that are typically engaged during interactions with an object. In this scenario, a retrieval cue triggers reactivation of all episodic memory traces, in proportion to the similarity between the cue its 'echo,' the components shared by most activated traces. In a process called 're-injection,' the first echo acts as a further retrieval cue, evoking the 'second echo,' the less frequently associated components of the cue. Thus, the 're-injection' process provides a more complete meaning for the object. According to this model, different types of stimuli will evoke differential 'echos' based on typical interactions with them. For example, a distinction is made between functional and visual components of various stimuli, such that impairment to these aspects of the memory trace will inhibit the re-injection process needed to complete the object representation. This theory has been used to explain category-specific agnosias that impair recognition of various object types, such as animals and words, to different degrees.\n\nVisual object agnosia (or semantic agnosia) is the most commonly encountered form of agnosia. The clinical \"definition\" of the disorder is when an affected person is able to copy/draw things that they cannot recognize. Individuals afflicted with the associative type often cannot identify, describe or mimic functions of items, though perception is intact, since images of objects can be copied or drawn. Individuals may retain semantic knowledge of the items, as exemplified during tasks where objects are presented through alternate modalities, through touch or verbal naming or description. Some associative visual object agnostics retain the ability to categorize items by context or general category, though unable to name or describe them. Diffuse hypoxic damage is the most common cause of visual object agnosias.\n\nCategory-specific agnosias are differential impairments in subject knowledge or recognition abilities pertaining to specific classes of stimuli, such as living things vs. non-living things, animate vs. inanimate things, food, metals, musical instruments, etc. Some of the most common category-specific agnosias involve recognition impairments for living things, but not non-living things, or human faces, as in prosopagnosia. This type of deficit is typically associated with head injury or stroke, though other medical conditions have been implicated, such as, herpes encephalitis.\n\nProsopagnosia (or \"face blindness\") is a category-specific visual object agnosia, specifically, impairment in visual recognition of familiar faces, such as close friends, family, husbands, wives, and sometimes even their own faces. Individuals are often able to identify others through alternate characteristics, such as, voice, gait, context or unique facial features. This deficit is typically assessed through picture identification tasks of famous persons. This condition is associated with damage to the medial occipito-temporal gyri, including the fusiform and lingual gryi, as the suggested location of the brain's face recognition units.\n\nTwo subtypes are distinguished behaviorally as being associative or apperceptive in nature. Associative prosopagnosia is characterized by an impairment in recognition of a familiar face as familiar; however, individuals retain the ability to distinguish between faces based on general features, such as, age, gender and emotional expression. This subtype is distinguished through facial matching tasks or feature identification tasks of unknown faces.\n\nPure alexia (\"alexia without dysgraphia\" or \"pure word blindness\") is a category-specific agnosia, characterized by a distinct impairment in reading words, despite intact comprehension for verbally presented words, demonstrating retained semantic knowledge of words. Perceptual abilities are also intact, as assessed by word-copying tasks.\n\nCerebral achromatopsia, also known as Color agnosia, is a category-specific semantic impairment pertaining to semantic color associations, such that individuals retain perceptual abilities for distinguishing color, demonstrated through color categorization or hue perception tasks; however knowledge of typical color-object relationships is defective. Color agnostics are assessed on performance coloring in black and white images of common items or identifying abnormally colored objects within a set of images. For example, a color agnostic may not identify a blue banana as being improperly colored.\n\nThis deficit should be distinguished from color anomia, where semantic information about color is retained, but the name of a color cannot be retrieved, though co-occurrence is common. Both disorders linked to damage in the occipito-temporal cortex, especially in the left hemisphere, which is believed to play a significant role in color memory.\n\nA recognition disorder is not considered to be agnosia unless there is a lack of aphasia, dementia, or other generalized defect that affects any stage of the object recognition process, such as, deficiencies in intelligence, linguistic ability, memory, attention or sensory perception. Therefore, individuals must be assessed for language ability, auditory comprehension, fluency, repetition, praxis, and reading and writing.\n\n\nSpecialists, like ophthalmologists or audiologists, can test for perceptual abilities. Detailed testing is conducted, using specially formulated assessment materials, and referrals to neurological specialists is recommended to support a diagnosis via brain imaging or recording techniques. The separate stages of information processing in the object recognition model are often used to localize the processing level of the deficit.\n\nTesting usually consists of object identification and perception tasks including:\n\nSensory modality testing allows practitioners to assess for generalized versus specific deficits, distinguishing visual agnosias from optic aphasia, which is a more generalized deficit in semantic knowledge for objects that spans multiple sensory modalities, indicating an impairment in the semantic representations themselves.\n\nThe distinction between visual agnosias can be assessed based on the individual's ability to copy simple line drawings, figure contour tracking, and figure matching. Apperceptive visual agnostics fail at these tasks, while associative visual agnostics are able to perform normally, though their copying of images or words is often slavish, lacking originality or personal interpretation.\n\nThe affected individual may not realize that they have a visual problem and may complain of becoming \"clumsy\" or \"muddled\" when performing familiar tasks such as setting the table or simple DIY.\nAnosognosia, a lack of awareness of the deficit, is common and can cause therapeutic resistance. In some agnosias, such as prosopagnosia, awareness of the deficit is often present; however shame and embarrassment regarding the symptoms can be a barrier in admission of a deficiency. Because agnosias result from brain lesions, no direct treatment for them currently exists, and intervention is aimed at utilization of coping strategies by patients and those around them. Sensory compensation can also develop after one modality is impaired in agnostics\n\nGeneral principles of treatment:\n\nPartial remediation is more likely in cases with traumatic/vascular lesions, where more focal damage occurs, than in cases where the deficit arises out of anoxic brain damage, which typically results in more diffuse damage and multiple cognitive impairments. However, even with forms of compensation, some afflicted individuals may no longer be able to fulfill the requirements of their occupation or perform common tasks, such as, eating or navigating. Agnostics are likely to become more dependent on others and to experience significant changes to their lifestyle, which can lead to depression or adjustment disorders.\n"}

An attending physician typically supervises fellows, residents, medical students, and other practitioners. Attending physicians may also maintain professorships at an affiliated medical school. This is common if the supervision of trainees is a significant part of the physician's work. Attending physicians have final responsibility, legally and otherwise, for patient care, even when many of the minute-to-minute decisions are being made by house officers (residents) or Midlevels (i.e. physician assistants and nurse practitioners). Attending physicians are sometimes the 'rendering physician' listed on the patient's official medical record, but if they are overseeing a resident or another staff member, they are 'supervising.'\n\nAttending physicians may also still be in training, such as a fellow in a subspecialty. For example, a cardiology fellow may function as an internal medicine attending, as he or she has already finished residency in internal medicine. The term is used more commonly in teaching hospitals. In non-teaching hospitals, essentially all physicians function as attendings in some respects after completing residency.\n\nThe term \"attending physician\" or \"attending\" also refers to the formal relationship of a hospitalized patient and their primary medic during the hospitalization, as opposed to ancillary physicians assisting the primary care physician. However, even on a consultation service, at an academic center, the physician who has finished his or her training is called the attending or consultant, as opposed to a resident physician.\n\n\n"}

There are five large, numbered Flatirons ranging from north to south (First through Fifth, respectively) along the east slope of Green Mountain (elev. ), and the term \"The Flatirons\" sometimes refers to these five alone. Numerous additional named Flatirons are on the southern part of Green Mountain, Bear Peak, and among the surrounding foothills.\n\nThe Flatirons were known as the \"Chautauqua Slabs\" c. 1900 and \"The Crags\" c. 1906. There are two hypotheses regarding the origin of the current name, one based on resemblance to old-fashioned clothes irons, the other based on resemblance to the Flatiron Building completed in 1902.\n\nThe Flatirons consist of conglomeratic sandstone of the Fountain Formation. Geologists estimate the age of these rocks as 290 to 296 million years; they were lifted and tilted into their present orientation between 35 and 80 million years ago, during the Laramide Orogeny. The Flatirons were subsequently exposed by erosion. Other manifestations of the Fountain Formation can be found in many places along the Colorado Front Range, including Garden of the Gods near Colorado Springs, Roxborough State Park in Douglas County, and Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Morrison.\n\nThe Flatirons on Green Mountain are within the City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks system. They are popular destinations for hikers and rock climbers, with rock grades ranging from easy (5.0) to world-class (5.14b).\n\nImages of the numbered Flatirons on Green Mountain are ubiquitous symbols of the city of Boulder. The area abounds with Flatirons photographs, drawings, paintings, and sculptures. The city government, the University of Colorado, and many businesses make use of this symbol in their logos, advertisements, and marketing materials.

{"id": "2195358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195358", "title": "Chuck Dressen", "text": "Chuck Dressen\n\nCharles Walter Dressen (September 20, 1894 – August 10, 1966), known as both Chuck and Charlie, was an American third baseman, manager and coach in professional baseball during a career lasting almost fifty years, and was best known as the manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers of 1951–1953. Indeed, Dressen's \"schooling\" of a young baseball writer is one of the most colorful themes in Roger Kahn's classic 1972 memoir, \"The Boys of Summer\". He threw and batted right-handed and was listed at tall and during his days as an active player.\n\nBorn in Decatur, Illinois, Dressen was a veteran baseball man when he took the reins in Brooklyn after the season. He began his professional career with the Moline Plowboys of the Class B Three-I League in 1919. Despite his small stature, Dressen also played professional football during his apprenticeship as a minor league baseball player. He was a quarterback for the Decatur Staleys (a forerunner of the Chicago Bears) in 1919-1920 and the Racine Legion of the National Football League in 1922–23.\n\nAfter he turned to baseball full-time in 1924, Dressen batted .346 in the top-level American Association, paving the way for his 646-game Major League Baseball playing career. Dressen played for the Cincinnati Reds from 1925–31, and was the club's starting third baseman from 1926–1929. He also was a late-season member of the New York Giants. All told, he batted .272 with 603 hits in the majors.\n\nDressen began his managerial career in 1932 with the Nashville Vols of the Southern Association. He interrupted that assignment late in 1933 to fill in as a third baseman for the Giants during the pennant drive when regular Johnny Vergez was forced out of the lineup because of appendicitis. Dressen started a dozen September games, batting .222.\n\nAlthough he didn't play during the 1933 World Series, he helped the Giants win Game 4. With New York leading the game by a single run in the bottom of the 11th inning, the opposition Washington Senators loaded the bases with one out, and sent up rookie pinch hitter Cliff Bolton. On his own initiative, Dressen called time, ran from the dugout, and told Giants' first baseman and player-manager Bill Terry how to pitch and defend Bolton, against whom Dressen had managed in the Southern Association. Bolton promptly bounced into a double play and the Giants won to take a three-games-to-one lead in the Series, which they ultimately won in five games. The incident stamped Dressen as a potential major league manager.\n\nAfter returning to Nashville at the outset of to resume his successful minor league managerial career, Dressen was called to Cincinnati to manage the last-place Reds on July 29, 1934. The Reds rose as high as fifth place under him, winning 74 of 154 games in , but when they fell back into the National League basement in , Dressen was fired.\n\nDespite his poor won-lost record (214–282, .431) in Cincinnati, Dressen made a valuable ally in the Reds’ mercurial general manager, Larry MacPhail. A year after MacPhail became president of the Dodgers in , he named fiery shortstop Leo Durocher player-manager and Dressen as his third base coach. Under MacPhail and Durocher, the Dodgers became a hard-playing pennant contender, winning Brooklyn's third NL pennant of the modern era in . But when MacPhail resigned in October 1942 to rejoin the armed forces and was succeeded by Branch Rickey, Dressen was fired from Durocher's staff — reportedly because he refused to eschew betting on horses. He was on the sidelines for the first three months of the season before being rehired by the Dodgers that July.\n\nAs the Second World War was ending, MacPhail returned to baseball as part owner, president and general manager of the New York Yankees. Following the campaign, he raided the Dodger coaching staff, signing Dressen and Red Corriden as aides under his new manager, Bucky Harris. The raids contributed to a public feud between MacPhail on one side and Durocher and Rickey on the other. Commissioner of Baseball Albert B. Chandler suspended Durocher for the entire season for \"conduct detrimental to baseball\", suspended Dressen for 30 days for signing a Yankee contract while still an employee of the Dodgers, and fined both clubs and some of their employees.\n\nMacPhail left baseball after the Yankees' 1947 World Series victory over the Dodgers, and Harris was sacked after the Bombers' third-place finish. Dressen was not retained by Harris' successor, Casey Stengel, but instead he replaced Stengel as the manager of the Oakland Oaks of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. He skippered the Oaks in 1949–50 and his teams finished second and first, winning 104 and 118 games. Simultaneously, a power struggle for control of the Dodgers ended in Walter O'Malley forcing Rickey out of the Brooklyn front office. When O'Malley fired Rickey associate Burt Shotton in the autumn of , he chose Dressen to manage the 1951 Dodgers.\n\nDressen's Dodgers, unlike his Reds of a decade and a half before, were a perennial contender in the National League, with a lineup that included four future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame — Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, Jackie Robinson and Duke Snider. They had won pennants in and , lost a playoff for the title in , and come within a run of forcing another playoff for the 1950 National League pennant.\n\nBrooklyn charged into first place early in the season, while the New York Giants — led since July 16, 1948, by Durocher himself — struggled (despite the callup of the 20-year-old rookie Willie Mays). When the Dodgers completed a three-game sweep of the Giants at Ebbets Field on August 10, the Brooklyn lead over the Giants reached 12½ games. Dressen proclaimed, \"The Giants is dead\". The following day, when Brooklyn won the first game of a doubleheader against the Boston Braves and the Giants fell to the Philadelphia Phillies, the Dodger lead stood, albeit briefly, at 13½ games.\n\nHowever, the Giants then began to win. With Sal Maglie, Larry Jansen and Jim Hearn anchoring their starting rotation — and (according to some accounts) with a \"spy\" stealing signs from their center-field clubhouse at their home field, the Polo Grounds — the Giants won sixteen in a row in August and 37 of their last 44 games (.841) while the Dodgers went 26–22 (.542) over the same period. At the end of the regular season, the teams were tied, necessitating a best-of-three game playoff to determine who won the league pennant. In the ninth inning of the decisive third game at the Polo Grounds, Dodger starting pitcher Don Newcombe had a 4–2 lead and two men on base when Dressen decided to go to the bullpen, where Carl Erskine and Ralph Branca were warming up. \"Erskine is bouncing his curve\", the manager was told by his bullpen coach, Clyde Sukeforth. Dressen summoned Branca, whose second pitch to Bobby Thomson was hit into the lower left-field stands for a three-run homer, a 5–4 Giants win, and a National League pennant — Baseball's \"Shot Heard ‘Round the World\".\n\nDressen kept his job in (Sukeforth resigned, while denying that the Branca decision was a factor in his departure) and for the next two seasons, the Dodgers dominated the National League, winning 201 regular-season games and capturing the pennant by margins of 4½ and 13 lengths. But they came up short against Stengel's Yankees in the World Series both times, losing in seven games in 1952 and six in 1953. Fresh from winning the pennant with 105 regular-season victories, Dressen decided to publicly demand a three-year contract from O’Malley instead of the customary one-year deal the Dodgers then offered their managers. When O'Malley didn't yield, Dressen effectively resigned when the owner allowed his old contract to expire. He was replaced by Triple-A Montreal Royals manager Walter Alston — a veteran minor leaguer who was then a relative unknown to Brooklyn fans and media. Alston went on to sign 23 consecutive one-year contracts with O'Malley, while winning seven NL pennants, four World Series, and a berth in the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nDressen returned to Oakland to manage the PCL Oaks in 1954 while he sorted out his big-league future, then was hired to replace Bucky Harris at the helm of the Washington Senators, who had gone 66–88 to finish sixth in the eight-team American League in 1954.\n\nDressen inherited a second division team with a poor farm system. Nevertheless, baseball observers predicted that he would rouse the Senators from their doldrums with his managerial acumen. On September 30, 1954 (Season 5 Episode 3), Dressen himself appeared on the Groucho Marx quiz program, \"You Bet Your Life\", and predicted that the Senators would finish in the first division (fourth place or higher). His former boss O'Malley said, \"Dressen will steal at least six games for Washington in 1955.\" Dressen also told his team, \"I guarantee we won't finish in sixth place again.\" He was right – but the 1955 Senators (53–101) finished eighth and last, the 1956 edition (59–95) finished seventh, and the 1957 club was 4–16 (and last again) on May 7, 1957, when Dressen was fired. His Senators won only 116 of 328 games — a winning percentage of .354. The team's next winning season would have to wait until , after the franchise had become the Minnesota Twins.\n\nAfter leaving Washington, Dressen rejoined the newly relocated Los Angeles Dodgers to serve as a coach under Alston in and . When the 1959 Dodgers won the World Series, Dressen was in demand as a manager once again. The Dodgers' then-archrivals, the Milwaukee Braves, were seeking to replace Fred Haney, their veteran manager who stepped down after his club lost the 1959 National League tie-breaker series to Alston's Dodgers. The Braves (1957–58) and Dodgers (1955–56; 1959) dominated the late-1950s National League, winning every pennant over the last half of the decade. Milwaukee was only three victories short (two in 1956 and one in 1959) of four consecutive NL championships. On October 24, 1959, the Braves named Dressen their field boss for .\n\nMilwaukee's roster still boasted Hall of Famers Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews and Warren Spahn. But the star players around them, including regulars Del Crandall, Joe Adcock, Bill Bruton, Wes Covington and Johnny Logan, and ace starting pitcher Lew Burdette, began to tail off in production, and the Braves' farm system could not keep up. Dressen was not able to reverse the Braves' slow decline to the middle of the NL pack. They again finished second in 1960 (going 88–66), but a full seven games behind, and were 71–58 and in fourth place late in when Dressen was replaced on September 2 by Birdie Tebbetts.\n\nIn 1962, Dressen returned to the minor leagues for one last assignment. He managed the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Triple-A International League, who had a working agreement with the Braves, to 91 victories.\n\nAs the season began, Dressen was out of uniform, scouting for the Dodgers. But after the Detroit Tigers won only 24 of their first 60 games under Bob Scheffing, Dressen was hired on June 18 to take over the team. He rallied the Tigers to a 55–47 record for the remainder of 1963, a first division finish in , and was mentoring many of the key players who won the 1968 World Series for Detroit, including Denny McLain, Willie Horton, Mickey Lolich, Dick McAuliffe, Bill Freehan and others.\n\nHowever, by his third year with Detroit, Dressen's health began to fail. In , a heart attack sidelined him during spring training and he didn't return as the Tigers' manager until May 31. Then he suffered a second coronary early in the campaign, on May 16. He was recovering from the heart attack when he was stricken with a kidney infection, and died of cardiac arrest in a Detroit hospital on August 10, 1966. Because Dressen's year of birth was commonly listed as 1898 during his baseball career, his age was reported to be 67 at his death. However, recent sources such as Baseball Reference and Retrosheet have \"backdated\" his birth year to 1894, making him 71 years of age at his passing. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\nKnown for his self-confidence, Dressen often told his star-studded Dodgers, \"Just hold them for a few innings, fellas. I'll think of something.\" His career big league managerial record was 1,008–973 (.509), including a 298–166 (.642) mark in Brooklyn.\n\n\n"}

It encompasses engineering which focuses on fire detection, suppression and mitigation and fire safety engineering which focuses on human behavior and maintaining a tenable environment for evacuation from a fire. In the United States 'fire protection engineering' is often used to include 'fire safety engineering'.\n\nThe discipline of fire engineering includes, but is not exclusive to:\nFire protection engineers identify risks and design safeguards that aid in preventing, controlling, and mitigating the effects of fires. Fire engineers assist architects, building owners and developers in evaluating buildings' life safety and property protection goals. Fire engineers are also employed as fire investigators, including such very large-scale cases as the analysis of the collapse of the World Trade Center. NASA uses fire engineers in its space program to help improve safety. Fire engineers are also employed to provide 3rd party review for performance based fire engineering solutions submitted in support of local building regulation applications.\n\nFire engineering's roots date back to Ancient Rome, when the Emperor Nero ordered the city to be rebuilt utilizing passive fire protection methods, such as space separation and non-combustible building materials, after a catastrophic fire. The discipline of fire engineering emerged in the early 20th century as a distinct discipline, separate from civil, mechanical and chemical engineering, in response to new fire problems posed by the Industrial Revolution. Fire protection engineers of this era concerned themselves with devising methods to protect large factories, particularly spinning mills and other manufacturing properties. Another motivation to organize the discipline, define practices and conduct research to support innovations was in response to the catastrophic conflagrations and mass urban fires that swept many major cities during the latter half of the 19th century (see city or area fires). The insurance industry also helped promote advancements in the fire engineering profession and the development of fire protection systems and equipment.\n\nIn 1903 the first degree program in fire protection engineering was initiated as the Armour Institute of Technology (later becoming part of the Illinois Institute of Technology).\n\nAs the 20th century emerged, several catastrophic fires resulted in changes to buildings codes to better protect people and property from fire. It was only in the latter half of the 20th Century that fire protection engineering emerged as a unique engineering profession. The primary reason for this emergence was the development of the “body of knowledge,” specific to the profession that occurred after 1950. Other factors contributing to the growth of the profession include the start of the Institution of Fire Engineers in 1918 in the UK, and the Society of Fire Protection Engineers in 1950 in the US, the emergence of independent fire protection consulting engineer, and the promulgation of engineering standards for fire protection.\n\nFire engineers, like their counterparts in other engineering and scientific disciplines, undertake a formal course of education and continuing professional development to acquire and maintain their competence. This education typically includes foundation studies in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and technical writing. Professional engineering studies focus students on acquiring proficiency in material science, statics, dynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, engineering economics, ethics, Systems in engineering, reliability, and environmental psychology. Studies in combustion, probabilistic risk assessment or risk management, the design of fire suppression systems, fire alarm systems, building fire safety, and the application and interpretation of model building codes, and the measurement and simulation of fire phenomena complete most curricula.\n\nNew Zealand was one of the first countries in the world to introduce performance based assessment methods into their building codes in regard to fire safety. This occurred with the introduction of their 1991 Building Act. Professor Andy Buchanan, of the University of Canterbury, established the first post graduate and only course available in New Zealand, at the time, in fire safety engineering in 1995. Applicants to the course require a minimum qualification of a bachelor's degree in engineering or bachelor's degree in a limited list of science course. Notable alumni from the university of Canterbury include Sir Ernest Rutherford, Robert (Bob) Park, Roy Kerr, Michael P. Collins, and John Britten. A master's degree in fire engineering from the University of Canterbury is recognized under the Washington Accord.\n\nIn the United States, the University of Maryland (UMD) offers the ABET-accredited B.S. degree program in Fire Protection Engineering, as well as graduate degrees and a distance M.Eng. program. Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) offers an M.S. and a Ph.D. in Fire Protection Engineering as well as online graduate programs in this discipline (M.S. and a Graduate Certificate). , Cal Poly offers an M.S. in Fire Protection Engineering. Oklahoma State University offers an ABET-accredited B.S. in Fire Protection and Safety Engineering Technology (established in 1937), Eastern Kentucky University also offers an ABET-accredited B.S. in Fire Protection and Safety Engineering Technology, the Case School of Engineering at Case Western Reserve University offers a master's degree track in Fire Science and Engineering, University of New Haven offers a B.S. in Fire Protection Engineering. and the University of Cincinnati offers an associate degree in Fire Science and a bachelor's degree in Fire and Safety Engineering Technology as distance learning options, the only university in the U.S. and Canada to hold this distinction. Other institutions, such as the University of Kansas, Illinois Institute of Technology, University of California, Berkeley, University of California, San Diego, Eastern Kentucky University, and the University of Texas at Austin have or do offer courses in Fire Protection Engineering or technology.\n\nCanada has fire engineering programs at York University and the University of Waterloo.\n\nThe practice of final fire sprinkler systems design and hydraulic calculations is commonly performed by design technicians who are often educated in-house at contracting firms throughout North America, with the objective of preparing designers for certification by testing by associations such as NICET (National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies). NICET certification is commonly used as a proof of competency for securing a license to design and install fire protection systems.\n\nIn Europe, the University of Edinburgh offers a degree in Fire Engineering and had its first fire research group in the 1970s. These activities are now conducted at the new BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering. The University of Leeds uniquely offers an MSc award in Fire \"and\" Explosion Engineering.\n\nOther European Universities active in fire engineering are:\n\n\nThe University of Ulster introduced its first fire safety programmes in 1975, followed by the first MSc Programme in Fire Safety Engineering in the United Kingdom introduced in 1990. In 2005 this MSc Programme will celebrate 25 years of unbroken service to higher fire safety engineering education. In 2004 the Institute for Fire Safety Engineering and Technology at the University of Ulster FireSERT occupied its new fire safety engineering laboratories which were funded by £6 million pound Infrastructure Award. The new facilities are state of the art fire safety engineering laboratories including a large scale burn hall and a 10 megawatt calorimeter.\n\nIn Australia, Victoria University in Melbourne offers postgraduate courses in Building Fire Safety and Risk Engineering as does the University of Western Sydney. The Centre for Environmental Safety and Risk Engineering (CESARE) is a research unit under Victoria University and has facilities for research and testing of fire behaviour. The Charles Darwin University and the University of Queensland have active programs.\n\nAsian universities active in fire engineering include: Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Tokyo University of Science, Toyohashi University of Technology, and the University of Science and Technology of China.\n\nSuitably qualified and experienced fire protection engineers may qualify for registration as a professional engineer. The recognition of fire protection engineering as a separate discipline varies from state to state in the United States. NCEES recognizes Fire Protection Engineering as a separate discipline and offers a PE exam subject. This test was last updated for the October 2012 exam and includes the following major topics (percentages indicate approximate weight of topic):\n\nFew countries outside the United States regulate the professional practice of fire protection engineering as a discipline, although they may restrict the use of the title 'engineer' in association with its practice.\n\nThe titles 'fire engineer' and 'fire safety engineer' tend to be preferred outside the United States, especially in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries influenced by the British fire service.\n\nThe Institution of Fire Engineers is one international organization that qualifies many aspects of the training and qualifications of fire engineers and has the power to offer chartered status.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2195372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195372", "title": "Tarot of Marseilles", "text": "Tarot of Marseilles\n\nThe Tarot of Marseilles or Tarot of Marseille, also widely known by the French designation Tarot de Marseille, is one of the standard patterns for the design of tarot cards. It is a pattern from which many subsequent tarot decks derive.\n\nMichael Dummett's research led him to conclude that (based on the lack of earlier documentary evidence) the Tarot deck was probably invented in northern Italy in the 15th century and introduced into southern France when the French conquered Milan and the Piedmont in 1499. The antecedents of the Tarot de Marseille would then have been introduced into southern France at around that time. The 78-card version of the game of Tarot died out in Italy but survived in France and Switzerland. When the game was reintroduced into northern Italy, the Marseilles designs of the cards were reintroduced with it. All Italian-suited tarot decks outside of Italy are descended from the Milan-Marseilles type with the exception of some early French and Belgian packs which show mixed influence from Bolognese tarot (see below). The earliest surviving cards of the Marseilles pattern were produced by Jean Noblet of Paris around 1650.\n\nThe recent documentary \"Les mystères du Tarot de Marseille\" (Arte, 18 February 2015) claims that the work of Marsilio Ficino can be credited as having inspired imagery specific to the Marseilles.\n\nThe name \"Tarot de Marseille\" is not of particularly ancient vintage; it was coined as late as 1856 by the French card historian Romain Merlin, and was popularized by French cartomancers Eliphas Levi, Gérard Encausse, and Paul Marteau who used this collective name to refer to a variety of closely related designs that were being made in the city of Marseilles in the south of France, a city that was a centre of playing card manufacture, and were (in earlier, contemporaneous, and later times) also made in other cities in France. The Tarot de Marseille is one of the standards from which many tarot decks of the 19th century and later are derived.\n\nThe term \"Tarot de Marseille\" has, in the past, most often been translated into English as \"Tarot of Marseilles\" because of the English exonym \"Marseilles\" for the city whose name in French is spelled \"Marseille\". The spelling \"Marseille\" is gradually enjoying greater, concurrent usage in the English language to describe the city generally; likewise, the alternative English translation \"Tarot of Marseille\" for the French term \"Tarot de Marseille\" is gradually increasing in usage.\n\nOthers have also tended to use the initials TdM, allowing for ambiguity as to whether the M stands for \"Marseille\" or \"Milan\", a region claimed for the origins of the image design.\n\nIn deference to the common appellation \"Marseille\" for the style and in recognition that the deck appears in other places, the term \"Marseille-style\" is at times also used.\n\nLike other Tarot decks, the Tarot de Marseille contains fifty-six cards in the four standard suits. In French-language versions of the Tarot de Marseille, those suits are identified by their French names of \"Bâtons\" (Batons), \"Épées\" (Swords), \"Coupes\" (Cups), and \"Deniers\" (Coins). These count from Ace to 10. There was also an archaic practice of ranking the cards 10 to Ace for the suit of cups and coins in line with all other tarot games outside of Sicily.\n\nAs well, there are four face cards in each suit: a \"Valet\" (Knave or Page), \"Chevalier\" or \"Cavalier\" (Horse-rider or Knight), \"Dame\" (Queen) and \"Roi\" (King). Occultists (and many tarot readers nowadays, whether English- or French-speaking) call this series the Minor Arcana (or \"Arcanes Mineures\", in French). The court cards are sometimes called \"Les Honneurs\" (The Honors) or \"Les Lames Mineures de Figures\" (The Minor Figure Cards) in French, and the \"Royal Arcana\" in English. For the \"Valet de Bâtons\" (French > \"Page of Batons\"), the title of that card generally appears on the side of the card, while in some old versions of the Tarot de Marseille that card, along with either some or all others, is left unnamed.\n\nIn the Tarot de Marseille, as is standard among Italian suited playing cards, the pip cards in the suit of swords are drawn as abstract symbols in curved lines, forming a shape reminiscent of a mandorla. On the even numbered cards, the abstract curved lines are all that is present. On the odd numbered cards, a single fully rendered sword is rendered inside the abstract designs. The suit of batons is drawn as straight objects that cross to form a lattice in the higher numbers; on odd numbered baton cards, a single vertical baton runs through the middle of the lattice. On the tens of both swords and batons, two fully rendered objects appear imposed on the abstract designs. The straight lined batons and the curved swords continue the tradition of Mamluk playing cards, in which the swords represented scimitars and the batons polo mallets.\n\nIn this abstraction, the Tarot, and the Italian playing cards tradition, diverges from that of Spanish playing cards, in which swords and batons are drawn as distinct objects. Cups and coins are drawn as distinct objects. Most decks fill up blank areas of the cards with floral decorations. The two of cups typically contains a floral caduceus-like symbol terminating in two heraldic dolphin heads. The two of coins usually joins the two coins by a ribbon motif; the ribbon is a conventional place for the manufacturer to include his name and the date.\n\nThere is also a suit of twenty-two \"atouts\" (trump cards). The Fool, which is unnumbered in the Tarot de Marseille, is viewed as separate and additional to the other twenty-one numbered trumps because it usually cannot win a trick. Occultists (and many tarotists nowadays) call these twenty-two cards \"Les Lames Majeures de Figures\" (The Major Figure Cards) or \"Arcanes Majeures\" (major arcana) in French.\n\nThe labelling of cards is a practice of French origin, Italians remembered their names by heart. The XIII card is generally left unlabelled in the various old and modern versions of the Tarot de Marseille, but it is worth noting that in Noblet's deck (circa 1650), the card was named LAMORT (Death). In at least some printings of the French/English bilingual version of Grimaud's pack, the XIII card is named \"La Mort\" in French and named \"Death\" in English. In many modern cartomantic tarot decks (e.g., Rider-Waite-Smith), the XIII card is named Death.\n\nThe names given to the Marseilles pattern trumps differ from those in early Italian sources. The French \"la Force\" (Strength) is in Italian \"la Fortezza\" (Fortitude) for the cardinal virtue of Courage. \"L'Amoureux\" (the Lover) is in Italy \"l'Amore\" (Love). \"Le Jugement\" (the Judgement) is \"l'Angelo\" (the Angel) or \"le Trombe\" (the Trumpets). \"L'Ermite\" (the Hermit) is given either as \"il Gobbo\" (the Hunchback), \"il Vecchio\" (the Old Man), or as \"il Tempo\" (Time). \"Le Pendu\" (the Hanged Man) is \"il Traditore\" (the Traitor). \"La Torre/la Maison Dieu\" (the Tower/the House of God) is given either as \"la Sagitta\" (the arrow), \"la Saetta\" (Lightning), \"la Casa del Diavolo\" (the House of the Devil), \"la Casa del Dannato\" (the House of the Damned), \"il Fouco\" (the Fire), or as \"l'inferno\" (Hell). The ranking of the trumps vary according to region or time period.\n\nThe following trump images are from Jean Dodal's deck printed in Lyon in the early 18th century. Like most other tarot decks, it uses additive Roman numerals, hence \"IIII\" instead of \"IV\".\n\nThe use of obviously Christian traditional images (such as the Pope, the Devil, the Grim Reaper and the Last Judgement) and indeed controversial images such as \"La Papesse\" have spawned controversies from the Renaissance to the present because of its portrayal of a female pope. There is no solid historical evidence of a female pope, but this card may be based around the mythical Pope Joan.\n\nOne variant of the Tarot de Marseille, now called the Tarot of Besançon, removes the controversial Popess and Pope and, in their stead, puts Juno with her peacock, and Jupiter with his eagle. Developed in Alsace at the beginning of the 18th century, this deck was popular among Catholics living in regions that bordered Protestant communities. Protestants, and Catholics living outside contentious zones, preferred using the Marseilles pattern. During the French Revolution, the Emperor and Empress cards became the subject of similar controversies and were displaced by Grandfather and Grandmother. It arrived in Besançon only at the beginning of the 19th century where mass-production caused the current association of this deck to that city. An updated variant of the Besançon pattern is the \"Swiss 1JJ Tarot\" which is still in use by Troccas and Troggu players.\n\nIn the early eighteenth century the Marseilles Tarot was introduced in Northern Italy starting from the Kingdom of Sardinia, which also included the Savoy (now in France) and Piedmont, where the card manufacturing industry collapsed following a severe economic depression. The Piedmontese players did not have difficulties to accept the Marseilles Tarot, because the images were similar and even the French language captioning was widespread in many areas of Piedmont.\n\nAround 1820 some manufacturers active in Turin, capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia, began to produce Tarot decks in Marseille's pattern, but after few years they introduced captions in Italian and small variations in certain figures. For example, the Fool was not chased by a wild animal but had a butterfly in front of him. In a few decades, variation after variation, was consolidated the iconography of the Piedmontese Tarot, which therefore must be considered as a derivation of the Tarot of Marseilles. It is currently the most widely used tarot deck in Italy.\n\nIn the Austrian-ruled Duchy of Milan (modern-day Lombardy), the Marseilles pattern also took root with Italian captioning starting around 1810. The \"Death\" card was given several names by different manufacturers such as \"il Tredici\" (Thirteen), \"lo Specchio\" (the Skeleton), and \"Uguaglianza\" (Equality). Production of this pattern stopped before the First World War.\n\nAround 1835, Carlo Della Rocca of Milan engraved an elaborate interpretation of the Marseilles pattern. It became popular throughout Lombardy for the duration of the 19th century. It spread to Piedmont where a double-ended version was adapted to local tastes and was popular until the 1950s.\n\nA few early French decks exhibit certain curiosities. The 1557 luxury tarot deck by Catelin Geoffrey of Lyon, the early 17th century Tarot de Paris, and Jacques Viéville's Parisian deck (c.1650) share many things in common with each other and the Marseilles pattern but also have designs that seem to be derived from the Bologna-Florence tradition as seen in the Tarocco Bolognese and the Minchiate.\n\nAdam de Hautot of Rouen produced a deck similar to Viéville's around the second quarter of the 18th century where \"la Papesse\" is replaced with \"Le 'Spagnol Capitano Eracasse\" (Italian > the 'Spanish Captain' Fracasso, a stock character from Commedia dell'arte). \"The Pope\", often depicted holding an orb or a covered communion chalice, is replaced by \"Bacus\" (Bacchus, the Greek god of wine) holding a wine cup or bottle and a fruited vine cane or bunch of grapes while astride a beer barrel or wine cask; this was copied from the Deuce of Acorns found in some German-suited patterns. \"The Hanged Man\" is shown still pendant but right-side up. \"Temperance\" bears the motto \"FAMA SOL\" (Latin > \"The Rumored or Omened Day\") in a scroll, probably counseling patience until the day of their deliverance from Spain. \"The Tower\" is renamed \"La Foudre\" (French > \"The Lightning\"), and shows a man sitting beneath a tree being struck by lightning. \"The Star\" shows a man with compasses staring up at the sky next to a tower. \"The Moon\" shows a woman holding a distaff and \"The Sun\" shows a man on horseback bearing a banner. \"The World\" depicts a naked woman atop a globe parted into a moon in a starry sky and a sun in a blue sky over a tower on land. Unusually, the Fool is numbered as trump XXII likely showing that it functioned as the highest trump. Very similar decks were soon produced in the Austrian Netherlands (modern-day Belgium) until the beginning of the 19th century. Packaging indicates that they were locally called \"Cartes de Suisse\". This may suggest that Belgian players were being influenced by a new mode of play emanating from Switzerland in which the Fool is treated like the highest trump as in Troggu.\n\nDummett conjectures that this family of decks, especially those of Viéville's design, originate from the Savoy-Piedmont-Lombardy region and were used until the collapse of the local card manufacturing industry at the end of the 17th century (as described above). Viéville's ordering of the trumps is almost identical to 16th century orders in Pavia and Mondovì. However, no cards from this region before the 18th century are known to have survived to prove or disprove this theory.\n\nAll cards were originally printed from woodcuts; the cards were later coloured either by hand or by the use of stencils. Tarot was recorded as being very popular card game throughout France during the 16th and early 17th century but later fell into obscurity with the exception of eastern France and Switzerland. Very few Marseilles pattern cards from the 17th century have survived, chiefly among them are Noblet's. In contrast, dozens of decks from the 18th century have made it to the present. From eastern France and Switzerland, the game spread north to Sweden and east to Russia starting from the middle of the 18th century, making it one of the most popular card games of that era until being overtaken by Whist in the 19th century.\n\nOne well-known artisan producing tarot cards in the Marseilles pattern was Nicolas Conver (circa 1760). It was the Conver deck, or a deck very similar to it, that came to the attention of Antoine Court de Gébelin in the late 18th century. Court de Gébelin's writings, which contained much by way of speculation as to the supposed Egyptian origin of the cards and their symbols, called the attention of occultists to tarot decks. As such, Conver's deck became the model for most subsequent esoteric decks, starting with the deck designed by Etteilla forward. Cartomancy with the Tarot was definitely being practised throughout France by the end of the 18th century; Alexis-Vincent-Charles Berbiguier reported an encounter with two \"sibyls\" who divined with Tarot cards in the last decade of the century at Avignon.\n\nFrom the mid-18th to early 19th centuries, Marseilles and Besançon tarots were replaced by the French-suited animal tarots throughout most of Europe. These were then superseded by genre art tarots like the \"Industrie und Glück\". French players ignored animal tarots but during the 20th century, they switched over to the genre art Tarot Nouveau. French truck drivers were still using the Marseilles pattern for French tarot as late as the 1970s.\n\nIn 1997 Alejandro Jodorowsky and Phillipe Camoin completed their reconstructed version of the Tarot of Marseille. Since then Jodorowky, in collaboration with Marianne Costa, published a Tarot book based around this reconstructed version of the Marseille deck.\n\nIn the English-speaking world, where there is little or no tradition of using tarots as playing cards, tarot decks only became known through the efforts of occultists influenced by French tarotists such as Etteilla, and later, Eliphas Lévi. These occultists later produced esoteric decks that reflected their own ideas, and these decks were widely circulated in the anglophone world. Various esoteric decks such as the Rider-Waite-Colman Smith deck (conceived by A. E. Waite and rendered by Pamela Colman Smith), and the Thoth Tarot deck (conceived by Aleister Crowley and rendered by Lady Frieda Harris) -- and tarot decks inspired by those two decks—are most typically used. Waite, Colman Smith, Crowley and Harris were all former members of the influential, Victorian-era Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn at different respective points in time; and the Golden Dawn, in turn, was influenced by Lévi and other French occult revivalists. Although there were various other respective influences (e.g., Etteilla's pip card meanings in the case of Waite/Colman Smith), Waite/Colman Smith's and Crowley/Harris' decks were greatly inspired by the Golden Dawn's member-use tarot deck and the Golden Dawn's tarot curriculum.\n\nThe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was essentially the first in the Anglophone world to venture into esoteric tarot. Francophone occultists such as Court de Gebelin, Etteilla, Eliphas Lévi, Oswald Wirth and Papus were influential in fashioning esoteric tarot in the French-speaking world; the influence of these Francophone occultists has come to bear even on interpretation of the Tarot de Marseille cards themselves. Even though the Tarot de Marseille decks are not 'occult' \"per se\", the imagery of the Tarot de Marseille decks is claimed by Levi to have Hermetic influences (e.g., alchemy, astronomy, etc.). Referring to the Tarot of the Bohemians, Eliphas Levi declares: \"This book, which may be older than that of Enoch, has never been translated, but is still preserved unmutilated in primeval characters, on detached leaves, like the tablets of the ancients... It is, in truth, a monumental and extraordinary work, strong and simple as the architecture of the pyramids, and consequently enduring like those - a book which is the summary of all sciences, which can resolve all problems by its infinite combinations, which speaks by evoking thought, is the inspirer and moderator of all possible conceptions, and the masterpiece perhaps of the human mind. It is to be counted unquestionably among the very gret gifts bequeathed to us by antiquity...\"\n\nIn the French-speaking world, users of the tarot for divination and other esoteric purposes such as Alejandro Jodorowsky, Kris Hadar, and many others, continue to use the Tarot de Marseille, although Oswald Wirth's Atouts-only (major-arcana) tarot deck has enjoyed such popularity in the 20th century (albeit less so than the Tarot de Marseille). In the mid-1990s Jodorowsky contacted a late descendant of the Camoin family, who has printed the Tarot of Marseilles since the 19th century. They worked together for almost a decade to put together a 78-card deck, including the original detail and 11 color printing. Tarot decks from the English-speaking tradition (such as Rider-Waite-Colman Smith and decks based on it) are also gaining some popularity in French-speaking countries.\n\nPaul Marteau pioneered the number-plus-suit-plus-design approach to interpreting the numbered minor arcana cards ['pip cards'] of the Tarot de Marseille. Before Marteau's book \"Le Tarot de Marseille\" (which was first published \"circa\" 1930s), cartomantic meanings (such as Etteilla's) were generally the only ones published for interpreting Marseille pip cards. Even nowadays, as evidenced by tarot readings of members of French-language tarot lists and forums on the Internet, many French tarotists employ only the major arcana cards for divination. In fact, in recognition of this, many French-language Tarot de Marseille tarot books (even good ones, such as Picard's) discuss the symbolism and interpretation of only the major arcana. Many fortune-tellers in France who use the \"Tarot de Marseille\" for readings will use only the major arcana and will use an Etteilla deck if they are to use all 78 cards for the reading.\n\nMany of the images of the Rider-Waite-Colman Smith (RWS or WCS) deck are derived from the \"Tarot de Marseille\". However, the influence of other decks is also apparent in the RWCS deck, e.g., the 17th century Jacques Viéville deck for the Sun card and the 16th century Sola Busca tarot deck for certain pip cards, notably the 3 of Swords and 7 of Swords. The 19th century deck of Swiss-French occultist Oswald Wirth was also influential for certain of the iconographic features of the Atouts or major arcana cards of the RWCS deck.\n\nVarious facsimiles of Conver's deck and other old decks are available. The Italian firm Lo Scarabeo prints a reproduction of an 18th-century deck by Nicholas Conver (with a re-constructed card missing from their original), mentioned above . The French firm Héron also publishes a photoreproduction of the complete Conver held in the Bibliothèque Nationale.\n\nOthers offer redrawn decks based on the old models. Grimaud is perhaps the best known such maker; their deck was designed by Paul Marteau, mentioned above. The Spanish firm Fournier prints an edition.

The second category – Preference Category II – were for lines needed for the community and these and Preference Category II were limited in total to 10% of the exchange. All other users were in Category III.\n\nThe scheme was established in the 1950s.

The village has a sunny climate (with, on average, 300 days of sunshine each year) and is set in a sheltered valley in the foothills of the Canigou mountain - which rises to a height of 2,785 metres (over 9,000 feet). Vernet-les-Bains is also known for its hot water spring. There is a professional spa/therapy centre in the village.\n\nVernet-les-Bains is located in the canton of Le Canigou and in the arrondissement of Prades.\n\nClose by is the Yellow train which runs from Villefranche-de-Conflent up to Mont-Louis and Latour-de-Carol. The line has the highest station in France at and is both a lifeline during winter conditions and a tourist attraction.\n\nThere is a \"local\" bus service between Perpignan & Vernet-les-Bains.\n\nVillefranche-de-Conflent is also on a regional train line that connects to Perpignan.\n\n\nNear the highest point in Vernet-les-Bains, next to the mairie (town hall), stands a monument to the Entente Cordiale of 1904. It is the only one of its kind in France.\n\nThe pedestal of the monument is made of Canigou granite. On it rest two white marble statues representing France and Britain. The pedestal itself is set upon a circular base. That in turn is located on a raised, level area of ground which covers 1,000 square metres and which is bounded by low stone walls.\n\nThe idea of erecting this monument was conceived around 1912 by the town council and its then mayor, Monsieur Joseph Mercader. The wealthy British visitors who regularly came to this health spa at that time actively supported the project. A committee of prominent French and British patrons was set up to promote the scheme. Its leading members were Lord Roberts and General Joffre. Monsieur Lambert-Violet, a leading Perpignan businessman, gave the land for the memorial to Vernet. The monument itself was the work of the Roussillon sculptor Gustave Violet, who displayed a model of his proposed work in 1913. However, progress came to a halt in 1914 with the outbreak of World War One. Little further happened until August 1920, when it was proclaimed by presidential decree that work on the monument would proceed but that it would be dedicated both to the Entente Cordiale and to the memory of those killed during the war. At the same time a new appeal was launched for funds to complete the project.\n\nWork on erecting the monument soon got underway. Granite was hauled up from the bed of the River St-Vincent in carts pulled by oxen. The stonemason, Monsieur Herbetta, worked up to fourteen hours a day, often in the sun's full glare, fashioning and putting into place the enormously heavy blocks of stone. A circle of wrought-iron fencing was erected around the base of the monument. Monsieur Antoine Mercader remembers, as a six-year-old child, how he and other children watched as the craftsman, Monsieur Serra, poured molten lead into small holes in the ground to seal in place the fence's iron bars.\nWhen the monument was completed, it bore the following dedications:\n\n\"To the Entente Cordiale between France and Britain. To the glory of the Allied Nations. To the memory of soldiers from Vernet who died for their country\"\n\nThe Église Saint-Saturnin is a church sitting on a hill with views of the mountains across the river. The church is small and basic, with a sundial on a side wall, and a plaque giving some details of the Church. The plaque states \"Chapelle N.D del Puig\" - which appears to have been on the site since 863.\n\nSt. George's Church is a parish church of the Diocese in Europe of the Church of England. It was constructed between 1912 and 1913 due to an influx of English residents to the town. During the 1960s the building closed for repairs, and didn't reopen until 1997, when a retired Anglican priest was asked to re-open the church. The building is constructed in a Romanesque style.\n\nIn 2019, St. George's became home to the first peal of change ringing bells in France, and the first ring of ten bells in mainland Europe.\n\nThere are a number of walks from and close to Vernet-les-Bains. It can be used as a base from which to climb to the summit of Canigou.\n\nRudyard Kipling, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1907, stayed in Vernet-les-Bains in 1910, 1911 and 1914. At that time, Kipling was well known in France, following the success of the French version of his classic work, The Jungle Book.\n\nWhile he was in Vernet, Kipling wrote about Canigou. In a letter to the Club Alpin, he praised it as \"a magician among mountains\".\n\nKipling also wrote a light-hearted short story entitled \"Why Snow Falls at Vernet\". It makes fun of the English habit of always talking about the weather.\n\nToday, the central bridge over the River Cady in Vernet-les-Bains is named after Kipling. The bridge, and the town itself, is featured in the Danish thriller film \"ID:A\" (2011).\n\n\n"}

Like all Anglican Communion churches, it recognises the spiritual leadership of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In addition, the church is an extra-provincial diocese under the metropolitical authority of the archbishop. The current bishop is Jorge Pina Cabral.\n\nThe establishment of a constitutional monarchy in 1834 granted limited religious toleration to non-Roman Catholics, and consequently led to the opening of an Anglican chapel in Lisbon. A second chapel was opened in 1868. The Anglican mission coincided with the growing influence of the Old Catholic movement in Portugal. Congregations were created from Catholic priests and laypeople who refused to accept the dogmas of the infallibility and universal ordinary jurisdiction of the Pope, as defined by the First Vatican Council in 1870.\n\nThe Lusitanian Church was formed in 1880 as representatives of these congregations met at a synod presided over by H.C. Riley, bishop of the newly formed mission in Mexico. The synod resulted in a constitution and a decision to abide by the doctrinal and liturgical standards of the Anglican Communion. In 1884, a Portuguese Book of Common Prayer was created, incorporating elements of Anglican, Roman, and Mozarabic liturgies. From the beginning the church was assisted by a Council of Bishops presided over by Lord Plunket, at that time Church of Ireland Bishop of Meath, and years afterwards there were some American Episcopal Bishops who provided Episcopal ministrations and pastoral care, particularly Bishops in Charge of the Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe, until the consecration of the first Lusitanian Bishop in 1958.\n\nUnder the terms of the Bonn Agreement, the Lusitanian Church established full communion with various branches of the Anglican and Old Catholic Communions. Full integration into the Anglican Communion occurred in 1980 when the Church became an extra-provincial diocese under the metropolitical authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nThe church has around 5,000 members.\n\nAs an Episcopal denomination, the church is governed by a bishop (Greek, επίσκοπος \"episcopos\"). The Lusitanian Church is a diocese with two archdeaconries, for the North and South of Portugal, and 14 parishes. It also has missions. The bishop has his episcopal see at Lisbon, where his throne is located in St Paul's Cathedral. The administration of the diocese is centred at Oporto.\n\nThe Lusitanian Church embraces three orders of ministry: deacon, priest, and bishop. Increasingly, an emphasis is being placed on these orders working collaboratively within the wider ministry of the whole people of God. A Portuguese language Prayer Book is the basis of the Church's liturgy.\n\nIn the early days of the church, a translation into Portuguese from 1849 of the 1662 edition of the Book of Common Prayer was used. In 1884 the church published its own prayer book based on the Anglican, Roman and Mozarabic liturgies. The intent was to emulate the customs of the primitive apostolic church.\n\nLike many other Anglican churches, the Lusitanian Church has entered into full communion with the Old Catholics. The church is now also a part of the Porvoo Communion, a communion of Anglican and Nordic Lutheran churches.\n\n\n\n"}

As of the 2010 Census, its population was 31,665.\n\nVeliky Ustyug has a great historical significance and was one of the major cities of the Russian North. It preserved some of the past urban structure and many of the architectural monuments. It has lost its former leading role and is nowadays mostly known for tourism.\n\nVeliky Ustyug is close to the confluence of the Sukhona (flowing from the west) and the Yug (from the south) rivers. Downstream from this confluence the rivers form a single waterway known as the Northern Dvina, sometimes referred to as the Little Northern Dvina. The historical center of the town is on the left (high) bank of the Sukhona and, in contrast to many historical Russian towns, there is an embankment along the Sukhona.\n\nDymkovskaya Sloboda and Troitse-Gledensky Monastery are on the right bank of the Sukhona. New parts of the town, mostly industrial areas, face the Northern Dvina. The only bridge in Veliky Ustyug is across the Sukhona upstream of the town center.\n\nPreviously, Gleden was a fortress, and the left bank of the Sukhona was a \"posad\"—a territory outside the fortress populated by craftsmen. In the 15th century, the fortress was destroyed in an attack by Vyatka army, and the new fortress was built in the former \"posad\" area. The fortress was demolished when it became apparent than no military threat to Veliky Ustyug exists.\n\nThe first recorded settlement in the area was the monastic settlement at \"Gleden\" (), founded near the confluence of the Yug and the Sukhona, where Troitsko-Gledensky Monastery is now. The name \"Ustyug\" means \"the mouth of the Yug\". By the late 15th century, the name changed to Veliky (Great) Ustyug.\n\nThe town of Veliky Ustyug was first mentioned in a chronicle in 1207. In 1212, Mikhaylo-Arkhangelsky Monastery was founded. It was a part of the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality (in contrast to the neighboring lands, most notably Totma, colonized by Novgorod). Thus Veliky Ustyug created the only obstacle to Novgorod's trade with the north, as the Sukhona and the Northern Dvina were the main waterways connecting Novgorod with the White Sea. Clashes between Novgorod and Ustyug became regular, especially throughout the whole 14th century. In 1328, Ustyug was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow.\n\nThe town was not immediately affected by the Mongol invasion of Rus' in the 13th century; however, its rapid growth in the second half of the century was due to influx of refugees from Central Russia.\n\nIn the 15th century, Veliky Ustyug became notable for the war between Vasily II of Moscow and his cousin Dmitry Shemyaka, which left northern Russia deserted. Shemyaka took Veliky Ustyug in 1450, drowned in the Sukhona those citizens who refused to accept him as a prince, and made the town his residence for two years, until he was driven off by the forces of Vasily. In the 15th century, the town had a great military importance and became the base for the operations against the Finno-Ugric peoples.\n\nIn 1613, during the Time of Troubles, Veliky Ustyug was besieged by Polish troops but never taken. At the junction of important trade routes, the town turned into a significant commercial and industrial center in the 16th and 17th centuries. Veliky Ustyug area was the birthplace of the explorers Semyon Dezhnyov, Yerofey Khabarov, Vladimir Atlasov, and of St. Stephen of Perm. Veliky Ustyug lost its key role as a river port with the diminishing importance of the Sukhona River route for trade between China and western Europe, which started with the foundation of Saint-Petersburg in 1703, whereby the trade was diverted to the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe 16th and 17th centuries were the time of the highest rise of the culture in Veliky Ustyug, in which it acquired a national-wide significance. The town is known for its remarkable handicrafts, such as silver filigree, birch bark fretwork, decorative copper binding, and niello. The town developed a distinct manner of icon painting — Ustyug icon painting. In the 17th century, Veliky Ustyug was a major producer of tiles, which are visible on many Ustyug churches and were sold to neighboring towns of the Russian North. On January 25, 1613, the town was unsuccessfully besieged by Polish-Lithuanian vagabonds (see Lisowczycy) led by Jakub Jacki.\n\nIn the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Veliky Ustyug was explicitly mentioned as one of the 20 towns included into the Archangelgorod Governorate. From 1719, it was the center of Ustyug Province, one of the four provinces of the Governorate. In 1780, the governorate was abolished and transformed into Vologda Viceroyalty. The latter was abolished in 1796, and Veliky Ustyug became the center of Velikoustyugsky Uyezd of Vologda Governorate. In 1918, the town became the administrative center of the newly established Northern Dvina Governorate. In 1924, the uyezds were abolished in favor of the new divisions, the districts (raions).\n\nIn 1929, Northern Dvina Governorate was merged into Northern Krai. The krai consisted of five okrugs, one of which, Northern Dvina Okrug, had its administrative center in Veliky Ustyug. In July 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to Northern Krai. In 1936, Northern Krai was transformed into Northern Oblast, and in 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast. Veliky Ustyug remained in Vologda Oblast ever since.\n\nVeliky Ustyug, in contrast to the majority of historical Russian towns, managed to preserve almost all of its architectural and cultural monuments. This was in a great part due to the efforts of the local intellectuals grouped around the Regional Museum, and most notably of Nikolay Bekryashev, the museum director from 1924 to 1938. This group managed to convince the authorities that the churches and old buildings have a historical significance and must be handed in the museum rather than demolished.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Veliky Ustyug serves as the administrative center of Velikoustyugsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with the town of Krasavino and the work settlement of Kuzino, incorporated separately as the town of oblast significance of Veliky Ustyug—one of the four administrative units in the oblast with the status equal to that of the districts. Within the framework of municipal divisions, the town of Veliky Ustyug, together with the village of Slobodka in Yudinsky Selsoviet of Velikoustyugsky District is incorporated as Veliky Ustyug Urban Settlement within Velikoustyugsky Municipal District. The town of Krasavino, together with six rural localities in Krasavinsky Selsoviet of Velikoustyugsky District, is incorporated as Krasavino Urban Settlement, and the work settlement of Kuzino is incorporated as Kuzino Urban Settlement; both also within Velikoustyugsky Municipal District.\n\nThere are timber industry enterprises in Veliky Ustyug, as well as a shipyard, food industry, and enterprises serving the tourist industry — in particular, the jewelry production plant.\n\nTourism is an important branch of economy in Veliky Ustyug. It started in the 1960s and got a further boost in 1990s when Veliky Ustyug started to be marketed as the residence of Ded Moroz, also known as \"Grandfather Frost\".\n\nRoads connect Veliky Ustyug with other towns. The road to the north runs to Krasavino and further to Kotlas. The one to the south runs to Nikolsk and further to Manturovo, where it connects to the road to Kostroma. The road to the southwest connects Veliky Ustyug with Vologda via Totma. It was built in the beginning of the 21st century; before this road was opened, the only way to get from Veliky Ustyug to Vologda was via Nikolsk and Totma. All these roads are paved.\n\nAn unpaved road, originating from Kuzino (which is connected with Veliky Ustyug by a ferry crossing) runs to Luza and continues to Lalsk and further to the Komi Republic.\n\nThe railroad connects Veliky Ustyug with Yadrikha railway station on the railroad connecting Konosha and Kotlas. The passenger service to Veliky Ustyug was discontinued in 2005.\n\nThe Sukhona, the Yug, and the Northern Dvina are all navigable in Veliky Ustyug, but there is no passenger navigation except for ferry crossings.\n\nVeliky Ustyug is served by the Veliky Ustyug Airport with occasional passenger service to Vologda.\n\nThe population of Veliky Ustyug was steadily growing until the second half of 20th century, but in the recent years it has been on decline, as is the general trend in Russia.\n\nVeliky Ustyug preserves much of its architectural heritage and has one of the best preserved architectural ensembles in Russia. The town contains 152 objects classified as cultural and historical heritage by the Russian Federal law and 25 objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local importance. It is classified as a historical town by the Ministry of Culture of Russian Federation, which implies certain restrictions on construction in the historical center.\n\nMost of the architectural monuments are on the left bank of the Sukhona, and many of these are the living houses. The exceptions are Troitsko-Gledensky Monastery and the Dymkovo Sloboda, on the right bank of the Sukhona. Troitsko-Gledensky Monastery is in the village of Morozovitsa, in Velikoustyugsky District.\n\nThe principal architectural ensembles of Veliky Ustyg are\n\nThe monuments of civil architecture are mostly concentrated along the Sukkhona, along Sovetsky Avenue and Krasnaya Street.\n\nSome of these buildings belong to the Velikoustyugsky Museum of History, Art, and Architecture. The museum was open in 1909 in the premises of Mikhaylo-Arkhangelsky Monastery. In 1918 it was transformed into the Museum of the Northern Dvina Culture. Between 1924 and 1938 the museum director was Nikolay Bekryashev, an artist, who devoted his energy to extending the museum to the old buildings, mostly churches, of the town, which thus were saved from destruction. In particular, a big collection of icons and objects of applied arts survived. Despite the efforts of Bekryashev and other museum employees, some of the buildings were destroyed by the authorities. The museum currently serves as an umbrella institution that organizes permanent and temporary exhibits in the former church buildings.\n\nIn 1998, Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov proposed to officially locate the residence of Ded Moroz, a fictional character somewhat similar to Santa Claus, in Veliky Ustyug. The residence, which is a resort promoted as the Votchina (\"estate\") of Ded Moroz, is a major tourist attraction. It is 16 km from the town, on the premises of Velikoustyugsky District. There is a dedicated post office there that answers children's mail to Ded Moroz.\n\n\n\n\n"}

On 4 September 1964, the type performed its maiden flight; mass production commenced shortly thereafter. It has been adopted by the IAF, which uses the type to conduct intermediate training of pilots following on from basic trainers such as the HPT-32 Deepak and Pilatus PC-7. Furthermore, during the 1980s, the IAF procured a number of Kirans that were furnished with a more powerful engine and a higher number of hard points; the variant was designated \"Kiran Mk II\". It has also been adopted by the Indian Naval Air Arm. The last Kiran was completed during 1989, after which the assembly line was shuttered.\n\nThe Kiran has been in operational use for over 50 years. Since the late 1990s, an indigenously designed successor, the HAL HJT-36 Sitara, has been in development, but has yet to enter service as of 2019. By the 2010s, use of the type was gradually declining as increasing numbers of newer BAE Systems Hawks, built under license by HAL, have been introduced to IAF service. The Kiran has been used by the Indian naval aerobatic team Sagar Pawan and was also used by the aerobatic team Surya Kiran of the IAF up until February 2011, at which point the team was disbanded after its aircraft were diverted to train fighter pilots. The Surya Kiran display team has been reequipped with specially-equipped Hawks. During December 2018, a handful of Kirans were donated by India to Myanmar.\n\nThe Kiran was developed by Indian aircraft manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in response the issuing of an Indian Air Force (IAF) requirement that called for a new intermediate jet-powered trainer aircraft. HAL's design team devised a relatively conventional trainer; according to author Chris Smith, their design was closely modelled on the BAC Jet Provost, an existing British jet trainer. HAL chose to adopt the British-sourced Rolls Royce Viper 11 turbojet engine, capable of generating up to of thrust, to serve as its powerplant. According to Smith, the development of what would become Kiran proved beneficial to other HAL projects, the design team being later redeployed to the HF-24 Marut, an indigenously designed fighter-bomber.\n\nOn 4 September 1964, a prototype performed the type's maiden flight. The initial production aircraft was designated \"Kiran I\"; during March 1968, the first deliveries of the pre-production aircraft were made to the IAF. Proving satisfactory, full-scale production of the type was approved shortly thereafter. Later production aircraft were fitted with hard points underneath each wing, which were intended for weapon training purposes; this modification led to such aircraft being redesignated as \"Kiran IA\". A total of 190 Mk I and 1A aircraft were manufactured.\n\nDuring the 1970s, work was undertaken by HAL on an uprated version of the aircraft; it was instead powered by the Bristol Siddeley Orpheus turbojet engine, capable of generating a maximum thrust of . This variant, which was also furnished with an enhanced weapon-carrying capability, was designated \"Kiran Mk II\". On 30 July 1976, this variant performed its first flight. Around this time, India was seeking a more advanced trainer aircraft in response to difficulties experienced with trainee pilots transitioning from the original Kiran to frontline fighter aircraft. Deliveries of the improved model commenced during 1985; production of the Kiran was terminated during 1989.\n\nSince the initial aircraft first being delivered in 1968, the Kiran has been operated by both the IAF and the Indian Navy for the intermediate elements of their training syllabuses. Since the late 1990s, HAL has been working on developing a successor to the Kiran, which has been designated HJT-36 Sitara. Its development has been protracted, being troubled by accidents during the test flight phase and having to perform an extensive redesign. Another jet trainer, the British-designed BAE Systems Hawk, has been license-manufactured by HAL to supplement and graducally replace the IAF's aging Kiran fleet since 2007. While deliveries of the Hawk and development of the Sitara continues, the operating life of the Kiran has been extended through to 2019, over 50 years after the first examples being delivered to the IAF.\nFollowing the grounding of the HAL HPT-32 Deepak fleet in 2009 amid safety concerns, the Kiran was temporarily used to perform both Stage I & II of fighter pilot training; this change was accompanied by considerable disruption, including a reduction of available flying hours to students as well as necessitating the redistribution of aircraft from the Surya Kiran display team. During 2010, an urgent request for proposals was issued, seeking a rapid replacement for the HPT-32 and to enable the Kiran fleet to resume normal operations; the Pilatus PC-7 was subsequently selected for this role.\n\nBoth the Indian Naval Air Arm and the Indian Air Force have independently operated their own aerobatic display teams, Sagar Pawan and Surya Kiran respectively. On 3 March 2010, a Kiran Mk II of the Sagar Pawan aerobatic team crashed into a building in Hyderabad during the Indian Aviation 2010 air show, killing both crewmembers and injuring four civilians on the ground. During the 2010s, the Indian Defence Ministry placed an order for 20 Hawk Mk132 aircraft with HAL to replace the remaining Kirans assigned to the Surya Kiran display team. By 2019, several Hawks had been issued to the Surya Kiran display team and had been used to perform its trademark aerial displays.\n\nDuring December 2018, India donated six Kirans to neighbouring Myanmar, these aircraft were dispatched along with a team of specialists to train both pilots and ground crew in their operation. Publication Times Now has speculated that this gift was an intentional politically-charged decision, intended to strengthen military ties between the two countries as well as to a means to counterbalancing the growing influence of China over the region.\n\n\n"}

Beamer was a cornerback for Virginia Tech from 1966 to 1968. His coaching experience began in 1972, and from 1981 to 1986 Beamer served as the head football coach at Murray State University. He then went on to become the head football coach at Virginia Tech from 1987 until his final game in 2015. He was one of the longest tenured active coaches in NCAA Division I FBS and, at the time of his retirement, was the winningest active coach at that level. Upon retiring, Beamer accepted a position as special assistant to the Virginia Tech athletic director, where he focuses on athletic development and advancement. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nBeamer was born in Mount Airy, North Carolina, and grew up on a farm in Fancy Gap, Virginia.\n\nBeamer is a direct descendant of the notorious Allen clan of Carroll County, Virginia. In 1912, during a court trial, his great-uncle, Floyd Allen, fired rounds in a spasm of violence. The courtroom shooting left five people dead, including the judge, a prosecutor, and the county sheriff.\n\nIn 1953, at the age of seven, Beamer suffered a life altering accident. After using a push broom to keep a pile of burning trash in place, he returned it to its place in the garage, unaware that it was smoldering. A spark ignited a nearby can of gasoline, which exploded in front of him. His 11-year-old brother, Barnett saved him by rolling him around on the ground. He was left with burns on his shoulders, chest, and the right side of his neck. Over the next several years, Beamer underwent dozens of skin graft procedures, leaving him with permanent scarring.\n\nBeamer attended high school in Hillsville, Virginia, and earned 11 varsity letters in three different sports: football, basketball, and baseball. In 1966, he attended Virginia Tech and played football. He was a starting cornerback for 3 years, playing in the 1966 and 1968 Liberty Bowls. He graduated from Virginia Tech in 1969 and attended Radford University for graduate school, while serving as an assistant football coach at Radford High School.\n\nBeamer began as an assistant at Radford High School from 1969 through 1971. His college coaching experience began in 1972, when he became a graduate assistant for the University of Maryland, College Park. After one season, he became an assistant coach at The Citadel under Bobby Ross. He spent seven seasons at The Citadel, the last two as the defensive coordinator.\n\nBeamer was hired as the defensive coordinator at Murray State University in 1979 under head coach, Mike Gottfried. In 1981, after two seasons as defensive coordinator, he was promoted to head coach. In his six years as head coach, Beamer compiled a record of 42–23–2 (.642). He hired former Murray State defensive back, Bud Foster as a graduate assistant in 1981. Foster later joined Beamer's coaching staff at Virginia Tech in 1987.\n\nOn December 22, 1986, Beamer was hired as the head coach at Virginia Tech, replacing Bill Dooley, the winningest coach in school history to date. However, Dooley had been forced to resign due to numerous NCAA violations. Beamer signed a four-year contract worth $80,000 annually, hired by Virginia Tech's new athletic director, Dale Baughman, also replacing Dooley in that capacity. Beamer took over a Virginia Tech football program that had reached six bowl games to that point (three under Dooley).\n\nAs a result of the violations uncovered under Dooley's watch, the Hokies were limited to 85 total scholarships in 1988 and 1989, and 17 initial scholarships in 1989. The sanctions hampered the Hokies, and Beamer went a combined 5–17 in 1987 and 1988. Beamer's record in his first six seasons was 24-40-2, a win percentage of .385. After the team went 2–8–1 in 1992, athletic director Dave Braine believed in Beamer and thought he deserved more time. It proved to be a wise decision; the Hokies would not suffer another losing season under Beamer's watch. At his hall of fame induction, Beamer said he would have been unlikely to survive his early years had he been coaching in the 2010s. \n\nIn 1993, the Hokies would go 9-3 and won the Independence Bowl; at the time, it was only the fourth time in school history that the Hokies had won as many as nine games in a season. The Hokies would go on to a combined record of 75–21 from 1993 to 2000. This included the Hokies' first major-bowl appearances in school history, after the 1995, 1996 and 1999 seasons. The peak year in this stretch was 1999, when the Hokies went 11–0 in the regular season earning a spot to the 2000 Sugar Bowl to play Florida State for the BCS National Championship. Behind the play of quarterback Michael Vick, Virginia Tech led Florida State 29–28 early in the fourth quarter, but lost 46–29. The Hokies finished third in the AP Poll and second in the Coaches' Poll–the highest final rankings in school history, and the highest for a Division I team from the Commonwealth.\n\nVirginia Tech continued its bowl eligibility streak into the new millennium and won the 2004 ACC Championship in its first season in the league. Over the course of the next seven seasons, from 2005 to 2011, Virginia Tech won at least 10 games every season. The Hokies were the only team in the country to do so. Beamer's record from 1993 to 2011 was 185–58 for a winning percentage of .761. This was the 4th highest win percentage in the country over this period. Although Virginia Tech went just 28–23 from 2012 to 2015, the Hokies still finished each season with a winning record and a bowl bid.\n\nOn November 1, 2015, Beamer announced his retirement from coaching, effective at the end of the 2015 season. He was carried off the field after beating Virginia in the final regular season game to become bowl eligible. Beamer's last game was a 55–52 win over Tulsa in the Independence Bowl on December 26. Memphis' Justin Fuente replaced Beamer as the head football coach at Virginia Tech at the end of the 2015 season.\nBeamer amassed an overall record of 238–121–2 (.663) in his 29 years at the school. His teams went to postseason play after every season from 1993 until his retirement in 2015. The Hokies' consecutive bowl appearances streak–the longest in the nation at the time– has continued under his successor, Justin Fuente. At the time of his retirement, Beamer owned all of the Hokies' 11-win seasons in school history, as well as all of the seasons in which the Hokies won 10 games on the field. Bill Dooley's last team, in 1986, finished with nine wins on the field, but was awarded a tenth win by forfeit.\n\nBeamer's teams won three Big East championships and four ACC titles. Beamer won many awards over his career. He was named the Big East Coach of the Year three times, in 1995, 1996, and 1999. He also was named the ACC Coach of the Year in 2004 and 2005.\n\nBeamer led the Virginia Tech Hokies to 23 consecutive Bowl games beginning in his 7th Season in 1993 until he retired in 2015. It was the 2nd longest active consecutive bowl streak in the country at the time of his retirement.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Assistant Head Coach, Shane Beamer was the acting Head Coach for the 2014 Military Bowl.\n\nOn November 1, 2015, after 29 seasons as head coach of Virginia Tech, Beamer announced his retirement from coaching, effective at the end of the 2015 season. During his tenure, he coached the Hokies to 23 consecutive bowl games, including a national championship appearance, along with seven conference championship titles. At the time of his retirement, he was the winningest active coach in Division I FBS with 280 career victories. and is the sixth winningest coach in history at the Division I FBS level.\n\nIn late 2015, shortly after announcing his retirement at the end of the season, Beamer signed an eight-year contract with Virginia Tech, serving as a special assistant to Whit Babcock, director of athletics at Virginia Tech, focusing on athletic development and advancement.\n\nOn January 17, 2017, Beamer was appointed to the College Football Playoff Committee. Beamer joined the 13-member panel, which was formed when the College Football Playoff was implemented in 2013. It is a 3-year appointment and he was the 14th person to be named to the committee. The members meet each of the final six weeks of the regular season to create a weekly poll of the top 25 teams in the country. The panel determines the top four college football teams for the playoff games to decide the national champion.\n\n\"Beamerball\"\n\nDuring Beamer's tenure at Virginia Tech, putting points on the scoreboard has become a full team effort with the offensive, defensive and special teams units. Often when the team scores one or more non-offensive touchdowns, the style of play is described as \"Beamerball\". Since Beamer's first season in 1987, a player at every position on the defensive unit has scored at least one touchdown, and 35 different players have scored touchdowns on Virginia Tech's special teams.\nBeamer Way\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Virginia Tech renamed Spring Road to 'Beamer Way' in honor of Beamer. Located on the west side of Lane Stadium, it is the primary access route to the campus sports facilities. The Virginia Tech Athletics Department also changed its mailing address to '25 Beamer Way' to commemorate his jersey number as a player at the school.\n\nBefore the beginning of the 2016 football season, new coach Justin Fuente and his staff collaborated on ideas of how to honor Beamer during the season. On August 29, 2016, the team announced that as an homage to Beamer's transcendent contributions and dedication to special teams, one deserving special teams player would be chosen to wear the number 25 jersey for each game of the 2016 season, earning the title \"\"Special Teams Player of the Week\"\". Beamer wore the number 25 when he played at Virginia Tech as a cornerback from 1966 to 1968. The honorary jersey became so popular with the players, fans and coaches that the team continued the tradition beyond the 2016 season.\nFrank Beamer Day\n\nFebruary 4, 2016 was declared \"\"Frank Beamer Day\"\" in the Commonwealth of Virginia by Governor Terry McAuliffe. In a ceremony on the steps of the Virginia State Capitol in front of a crowd of Virginia Tech students, faculty, and alumni— including his wife, Cheryl Beamer, government affairs directors, Paul Rice and Harvey Creasey III, and university president, Timothy Sands— Governor McAuliffe presented Beamer with a framed certificate to honor his achievements as the head coach of the Virginia Tech football program.\n\nBeamer-Lawson Indoor Practice Facility\n\nOn October 6, 2018, Virginia Tech renamed its indoor practice facility to the \"Beamer-Lawson Indoor Practice Facility\". The building, constructed in 2016 was renamed for Beamer and the family of John Lawson, a former rector of the Virginia Tech Board of Visitors and longtime donor\nFrank Beamer Statue\n\nOn October 6, 2018, a permanent bronze statue, honoring Beamer's legendary coaching career at Virginia Tech, was unveiled on Moody Plaza outside the Southwest entrance to Lane Stadium, on Virginia Tech's Campus.\nOther honors\n\n\nBeamer married Cheryl (née Oakley) on April 1, 1972. The two met on a blind date, arranged by Cheryl's sister Sheila, while Beamer was a senior at Virginia Tech. They have two children, Shane and Casey, and five grandchildren. His son, Shane played football at Virginia Tech as a long snapper, and was a member of the 1999 team that played for the national championship. After assistant coaching stops at four different universities, Shane was hired by Virginia Tech in 2011 as the running backs coach and associate head coach. Shane left Virginia Tech upon his father's retirement in 2015 and currently serves as the tight ends and H-backs coach at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nIn 2006, Beamer and his wife Cheryl published the children's book \"Yea, It's a Hokie Game Day!\" under Virginia publisher Mascot Books, Inc.\n\nAfter the April 16, 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, Beamer was a powerful voice in the Blacksburg community, stating that the most important thing that the Virginia Tech and surrounding community could do was to disallow the act of violence to define the university. Beamer is quoted as saying, “\"We can’t let one person destroy what goes on here every day, the caring, the thoughtfulness. We can’t let one person destroy tha\"t.” \n\n"}

He gave 440 performances of \"Home Entertainment Center\" at venues like the Canon Theater, Pasadena Playhouse, Marines' Memorial Theater, and The One Act in San Francisco (where the show ran for eleven months). For his performances, he was awarded the LA Weekly Theater Award, four Drama-Logue Awards, and three San Francisco Bay Area Critic's Awards. He also performed at the Aspen Comedy festival, the Cast Theater, Callboard Theater, and Las Palmas Theater.\n\nIn 1989, \"Home Entertainment Center\" achieved national fame when it was filmed and aired on Showtime; the filming was done at the Marines' Memorial Theater. The show featured original songs written and performed by Banks. On May 14, 1989, he appeared (with Penn Jillette) on the Dr. Demento radio program (that year's Mother's Day Special) and performed a number of his songs live on-air.\n\nThe ensuing fame landed him a TV pilot on Showtime in January 1991 – \"The Steven Banks Show\" (sometimes inaccurately referenced as \"The Steven Brooks Show\"). The plot of the show was much the same as his one-act play: Banks portrayed Steven Brooks – an underachieving, chronic procrastinator fascinated by trivia and cursed with a penchant for comedic songs.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, after Paul Reubens was arrested for allegedly masturbating in an adult movie theater, Banks was among a number of entertainers who protested the decision of CBS to drop Reubens' show from their lineup. Banks can be seen in a crowd of protestors on an LA street in the \"E! True Hollywood Story\" episode about Reubens' arrest. Reubens was later offered (and declined) a supporting role on Banks' fledgling TV program.\n\nShowtime aired the pilot for Banks' show, but never ran any other episodes. In 1994, PBS took an interest in his act. They filmed and aired \"The Steven Banks Show\" that summer – the first original sitcom ever produced and run by PBS. Brandon Tartikoff produced the show, filmed at WYES in New Orleans. A CD album for the show was also released, consisting of original songs written and performed by Banks. Thirteen episodes were shot and the program garnered critical acclaim, but one episode, \"Miss Janie Regrets\", was not aired due to controversy over a PBS-like children's show parody. Banks' show has attained a kind of cult status despite its short run on PBS. In one episode, Penn Jillette sang and played guitar, Teller on keyboard, joining Steven Banks. The song was \"I wear the clothes of the dead\", the setup for which was Penn wearing suits bought at estate sales.\n\nBanks has appeared in movies and several TV shows such as \"Beverly Hills Cop III\", \"Dharma & Greg\", \"King of the Hill\", \"Dream On\", \"Caroline in the City\", \"The Jimmy Kimmel Show\", \"Parks and Recreation\", \"Mom\", and \"My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\".\n\nBanks performed as \"Billy the Mime\" in the 2005 comedic documentary \"The Aristocrats\" which was created by Penn Jillette and Paul Provenza. Other appearances include \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", \"Penn & Teller's Bullshit!\", \"Parks & Recreation\" (his scene was cut out), and \"The Green Room with Paul Provenza\".\n\nBilly the Mime presented a six-week engagement at The Flea Theater in New York and has also appeared at The Upright Citizens Brigade Theater (LA and NYC), The New York International Fringe Festival, The Montreal Just For Laughs Festival, The Aspen Comedy Festival, SketchFest (San Francisco), The Revolutions International Theater Festival (New Mexico), The Lakeshore Theater (Chicago), and in Los Angeles at The Actors Gang, Sit 'n Spin, Largo, The Comedy Central Stage, The Steve Allen Theater in Girly Magazine Party and The Rudy Casoni Show and the Sacred Fools Theater Company.\n\nIn March 2012, he performed in San Paolo, Brazil at the Risadaria Comedy Festival and did 24 shows at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August.\n\nHe founded Billy's Moving Art Gallery in 2014. Their slogan is \"Bringing Affordable Art To The Masses Since 2014\". His paintings have hung in The Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Whitney Art Museum in New York, in The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Getty, The Broad and The Armand Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, The Hamburger Bahnhof Museum and The East Side Berlin Wall Gallery in Berlin.\n\nIn 1998, Banks began writing for Nickelodeon's animated series \"CatDog\". He wrote several \"CatDog\" books as well. He continued working for Nickelodeon, penning several \"SpongeBob\" books (including \"The Big Halloween Scare\", which actually charted on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list). In 2002, Banks was named head writer for \"\", and in 2004, he was nominated for one of the 56th Annual Writers Guild Awards for the episode \"Rescue Jet Fusion\".\n\nIn 2004, he wrote for \"Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi\", an animated series from the Cartoon Network about the adventures of real life J-pop music stars Ami Onuki and Yumi Yoshimura.\n\nIn late 2004, he became story editor and then head writer for \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" for seasons 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

He is known primarily as a comic book creator, and has also written for television and video games.\n\nWood was born in Essex Junction, Vermont. He relocated to New York City in 1991 and graduated from Parsons School of Design in 1997.\n\nWood's first professional work in comics was the 5-issue miniseries \"Channel Zero\", published by Image Comics from 1997–98, initially created as part of a final project for graduation from Parsons School of Design. \"Channel Zero\" is set in a dystopian near-future New York City where the tenets of Mayor Giuliani have grown into a freedom-restricting government initiative called 'The Clean Act'. The protagonist is Jennie 2.5, a DIY media personality. \"Channel Zero\" was orphaned shortly after Image Comics sold out of the first print run of the collection, opting not to return to press. AiT/Planet Lar acquired it soon afterwards.\n\nWood was absent from comics for two years, working at a series of Internet design jobs during the dot-com boom. In early 2000, Warren Ellis offered Wood a co-writing job on Marvel Comics' \"Generation X\", as part of Ellis's Counter-X run (in which Ellis served as \"Plotmaster\"). Wood co-wrote issues #63–70 with Ellis, and wrote #71–75 on his own.\n\nWood returned to creator-owned comics between 2000 and 2003, producing several graphic novels and miniseries, including \"Couscous Express\", \"The Couriers\", and \"Jennie One\" for AIT, \"Pounded\" for Oni Press, and \"Fight For Tomorrow\" for DC's imprint Vertigo. He was employed as AIT's art director for roughly six months, creating not only their logo and branding, but covers for many of the books they published during this time. He worked again with Ellis, creating 14 covers for the Wildstorm series \"Global Frequency\".\n\nIn late 2003, Wood quit his staff job at Rockstar Games and teamed with artist Becky Cloonan to create the monthly series \"Demo\". Each of the 12 issues told its own complete story, and included eight pages of \"backmatter\", bonus material that was intentionally left out of the eventual collected edition. The \"Demo\" format proved so successful that Wood went on to replicate it, with minor changes, for his 12-issue series \"Local\" at Oni Press, begun in 2005 and drawn by artist Ryan Kelly. \"Local\" differs from \"Demo\" in that it includes a focal character, Megan McKeenan, whose character arc is gradually traced through the series, although she is not always the protagonist within each issue. This difference has led \"Local\" down its own path; Wood refers to it as \"transcending its 'done in one' format to really be about Megan's story, her life, that progression over time\".\n\n2006 saw the publication of the graphic novel \"The Tourist\" from Image Comics, and \"Supermarket\", a 4-issue series from IDW co-created and drawn by Kristian Donaldson.\n\nIn August 2006, DC Comics announced that Wood was signed to an exclusive contract.\n\nWood co-created \"DMZ\", a critically acclaimed ongoing series from Vertigo for which he is best-known, \"Northlanders\", a historical-fiction series set during the Viking Age, \"The New York Four\" and \"The New York Five\", a young adult series, and a new \"Demo\" miniseries. For DC/Wildstorm, he wrote a \"DV8\" miniseries with Rebekah Isaacs, and a \"Supernatural\" miniseries with Grant Bond. \"DMZ\" and \"Northlanders\" have both received Deluxe omnibus reprints in both hardcover and paperback.\n\nIn August 2011, Wood discussed the conclusion of \"Northlanders\", the ending of his exclusive and regular work for DC Comics, and the rumors he was working on a \"Supergirl\" series for the New 52.\n\nShortly after his DC Comics exclusive ended, Wood wrote a series of X-Men comics for Marvel, starting with the \"\" miniseries. He was then announced as the ongoing writer of the \"adjectiveless\" X-Men title and penned issues #30–37. He signed on to \"\" and wrote issues #13–33. When \"X-Men\" was rebranded as an all-female title, he continued on as writer for the first 17 issues of that series. In 2014 he wrote Moon Knight #6–12\n\nWood returned to Image Comics with an omnibus edition of \"The Couriers\", followed by three new monthly series: \"Mara\" with Ming Doyle, \"Starve\" with collaborators Danijel Zezelj and Dave Stewart, and \"Black Road\" with Garry Brown.\n\nWood shifted the bulk of his creator owned work to Dark Horse Comics following his time at DC Comics. He created and authored the five-volume \"The Massive\", followed by the prequel series \"The Massive\" Ninth Wave, with art by Garry Brown, JP Leon, and Kristian Donaldson, among others.\n\n\"Rebels\", a historical series set during the American Revolution, was co-created in 2014 with artist Andrea Mutti. In 2017, Wood and Andrea Mutti returned for a second \"Rebels\" series, entitled \"These Free and Independent States.\"\n\n\"Briggs Land\", described as a crime series set within an American secessionist movement, is Wood's newest socio-political series, and secured a television deal with AMC prior to publication of the comic. Currently there are two volumes of \"Briggs Land\" in print.\n\nWood also brought the \"Channel Zero\", \"Demo\", and \"The New York Four\" properties to Dark Horse, who collected and printed them in comprehensive omnibus editions.\n\nFor the company, he did a 25-issue stint on \"Conan the Barbarian\", a 20-issue run on \"Star Wars\", and a miniseries leading into the release of the \"\" virtual reality video game. \n\nIn 2016, Wood and artist Tristan Jones launched \"Aliens: Defiance\", a new monthly series in the mold of the original 1979 film. It ran for 12 issues and collected into two volumes. It introduced the character of Zula Hendricks.\n\nIn June 2018, Wood and Mack Chater launched the monthly series \"Sword Daughter\".\n\nIn September 2018, Dark Horse announced \"Aliens: Resistance\", written by Wood with art by Robert Carey, Dan Jackson, and Tristan Jones. It was followed soon after by \"Aliens: Rescue\", with Kieran McKeown, colorist JL Straw, letterer Nate Piekos, and Mack Chater and Robert de la Torre on covers.\n\nPrior to his comics career, Wood held a day job for several years as a staff designer for Rockstar Games, designing for video game franchises such as \"Grand Theft Auto\", \"Midnight Club\", \"Max Payne\", \"Smuggler's Run\", and \"Manhunt\". \n\nWood is credited with co-writing \"\", created by Navid Khonsari.\n\nWood is credited as writing two web series in 2012 for \"Geek & Sundry\" adapting three \"The Massive\" short stories and the first story arc of his and Becky Cloonan's \"Conan the Barbarian\".\n\nHe also produced the short film \"Future Imperfect\".\n\nIn 2016 Wood commenced work on \"Briggs Land\", writing both a monthly comic book for \"Dark Horse Comics\" and a television pilot script for \"AMC Networks\". Wood confirmed on his Goodreads page that the AMC pilot is not moving forward.\n\nIn November 2013, cartoonist Tess Fowler accused Wood of sexual harassment. Wood addressed Fowler's accusations, stating, \"I did make a [verbal] pass at her [in 2003] at the SDCC Hyatt bar, but when she declined, that was the conclusion of the matter for me. There was never an exertion of power, no threats, and no revenge.\"\n\nFowler acknowledged that she had forgiven Wood years earlier, and focused on the wider industry issue of sexual harassment, responding in part: \"Brian Wood has every right to be a part of comics. To make books and make a living unhindered. I believe that. I also believe his behavior is a symptom of a much bigger disease.\"\n\nIn August 2019, ComicsAlliance founder Laura Hudson stated that Wood had harassed her and attempted to forcefully kiss her at a bar years previously. She also expressed admiration for Fowler and apologised for not coming forward sooner, which Fowler accepted. Following these allegations, Dark Horse Comics announced that \"(e)ffective immediately, Dark Horse will not pursue any new projects with Brian Wood. Dark Horse has cancelled the upcoming series Aliens Colonial Marines: Rising Threat.\"\n\nHudson's allegations brought her work to attention of Ava DuVernay, who hired her as a writer on the television adaptation of Wood's \"DMZ\". Hudson expressed her gratitude to Duvernay, stating \"I can't remember a time where sharing a #MeToo story has ended so positively, and I wanted all of you to know not only that it did but that it can.\"\n\n\"DMZ\" (script and art, with Riccardo Burchielli, Kristian Donaldson, Nathan Fox, Danijel Žeželj, Nikki Cook, Ryan Kelly, Andrea Mutti, Cliff Chiang, David Lapham, Shawn Martinbrough and others, DC Comics/Vertigo, 2006–2012) collected as:\n\n\"Northlanders\" (with Davide Gianfelice, Dean Ormston, Ryan Kelly, Vasilis Lolos, Danijel Žeželj, Leandro Fernandez, Fiona Staples, Riccardo Burchielli, Becky Cloonan, Simon Gane, Matt Woodson, Marian Churchland, Paul Azaceta and Declan Shalvey, 2008–2012) collected as:\n\n\"The Massive\" #1–30 (#1–3 with Kristian Donaldson, #4–9, #13–30 with Garry Brown, others) and The Massive\": Ninth Wave #1–6 with Garry Brown collected as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Athenaeus seems to have connected the Paeonian tongue to the barely-attested Mysian language, possibly a member of the Anatolian family.\n\nOn the other hand, the Paeonians were also regarded as being related to Thracians and ancestors of the Phrygians.\nModern linguists are uncertain on the classification of Paeonian, due to the extreme scarcity of surviving materials in the language. Wilhelm Tomaschek and Paul Kretschmer claim it belonged to the Illyrian family, while Dimitar Dechev claims affinities with Thracian. Irwin L.

He served as the non-executive chairman of Freddie Mac from September 2008 to December 2011, retiring from the board in February 2012. On December 20, 2013, Koskinen was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to head the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as Commissioner of Internal Revenue. On December 23, 2013, Koskinen was sworn in as the 48th IRS Commissioner after being nominated by President Barack Obama. His term ended on November 12, 2017, with David Kautter becoming his interim replacement, followed by Charles P. Rettig as his permanent replacement.\n\nKoskinen was born on June 30, 1939 in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1957, Koskinen graduated High School at Ashland High School (now known as Paul G. Blazer High School) in Ashland, Kentucky. He graduated magna cum laude with a BA in physics from Duke University in 1961, where he was a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity and Phi Beta Kappa. He graduated with an Bachelor of Laws, cum laude from Yale Law School in 1964, and did postgraduate work at Queens' College, Cambridge in England from 1964–65.\n\nKoskinen served as president of the U.S. Soccer Foundation from 2004–08. He previously served as the deputy mayor of the District of Columbia, the deputy director for management of the Office of Management and Budget, and then later President Clinton's chairman of the President's Council on Y2K, 2000 Conversion, the Year 2000 problem.\n\nHe served on the board of AES from 2004–13 and American Capital, Ltd from 2007–13. On March 11, 2009, he was announced as the interim CEO at Freddie Mac. On April 23, 2009, he became the principal financial officer after the death of Freddie Mac's acting CFO, David Kellermann. In August 2009, with the hiring of a new CEO, he returned to his position as non-executive chairman of the board of Freddie Mac.\n\nPrior to entering government service, Koskinen worked for 21 years for The Palmieri Company as vice president, president, CEO, and chairman, working on the turnaround of large, failed enterprises such as the Penn Central Transportation Company, Levitt and Sons, the Teamsters Pension Fund, Mutual Benefit, and Equity Programs Investment Corporation.\n\nEarlier in his career, Koskinen served as administrative assistant to Senator Abraham Ribicoff (D-Conn.) from 1969–73, was legislative assistant to Mayor John Lindsay of New York City from 1968–69, served as assistant to the deputy executive director of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (the \"Kerner Commission\") from 1967–68, practiced law with the firm of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher from 1966–67, and clerked for Judge David Bazelon, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, from 1965 to 1966.\n\nKoskinen chaired the Washington, D.C. host committee for the 1994 World Cup and the Duke University board of trustees. He is a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.\n\nOn August 1, 2013, the White House announced President Obama would nominate Koskinen as commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nOn December 20, 2013, Senate Democrats voted 56–39 for cloture on the nomination, cutting off a Republican-led filibuster. Senators then confirmed Koskinen in a 59–36 vote, along party lines. On December 23, 2013, he was sworn in as the 48th IRS Commissioner.\n\nKoskinen took office following the IRS scandal in which conservative political groups were targeted for extensive scrutiny by the IRS. The \"Washington Post\" awarded Koskinen \"Three Pinocchios\" for stating during congressional testimony on March 26, 2014, that \"the inspector general found inappropriate criteria were used to select organizations for further review—he did not refer to it as targeting.\"\n\nIn June 2014, Koskinen informed Congress that 30,000 emails from the account of a central figure in the scandal, Lois Lerner, had been lost. It later came to light that Koskinen had known about the lost emails in April and had waited until the information was disclosed in a court case to notify Congress. Koskinen stated: \"\"We confirmed that backup tapes from 2011 no longer existed because they have been recycled, pursuant to the IRS normal policy.\"\" In September 2014, however, the Treasury Department inspector general reported that it had found 760 tapes from which it later recovered Lerner's emails.\n\nOn November 24, 2015, Koskinen signed a memorandum that commits the IRS to fostering a model workplace free of conduct that negatively impacts employee engagement and productivity.\n\nAfter the Justice Department notified Congress in October 2015 that there would be no charges against Lois Lerner or anyone else in the IRS, 19 Republican members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee led by the committee's chairman, Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), filed a resolution to impeach Koskinen.\n\nThose sponsoring the impeachment resolution to remove Koskinen from office accused him of failing to prevent the destruction of evidence in allowing the erasure of backup tapes containing thousands of e-mails written by Lerner, and of making false statements under oath to Congress. In a statement released by the committee, Chaffetz said Koskinen \"failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled. Impeachment is the appropriate tool to restore public confidence in the IRS and to protect the institutional interests of Congress.\"\n\nThe IRS declared on October 27 that it did not have an immediate comment on the impeachment resolution. Representative Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland), the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement: \"This ridiculous resolution will demonstrate nothing but the Republican obsession with diving into investigative rabbit holes that waste tens of millions of taxpayer dollars while having absolutely no positive impact on a single American. Calling this resolution a 'stunt' or a 'joke' would be insulting to stunts and jokes.\"\n\nThe resolution was referred to the House Judiciary committee, which held hearings on the matter on May 23 and June 22, 2016.\n\nThe House leadership decided not to proceed further which led to threats to offer a privileged resolution for impeachment. On December 6, 2016, such a privileged resolution was offered, but the House voted to send the question back to the Judiciary Committee.\n\nKoskinen is married to Patricia Salz and has a daughter, Cheryl, and a son, Jeffery Koskinen.\n\nAs of June 25, 2014, Koskinen had contributed almost USD $100,000 to Democratic candidates and groups.\n\nKoskinen Stadium at Duke University, which hosts the Duke soccer and lacrosse teams, was named and dedicated in 1999 in honor of the support of John and Patricia Koskinen, who have various foundations. \n"}

The term usually refers to oxygenated chemical compounds added to fuels. Oxygenates are usually employed as gasoline additives to reduce carbon monoxide and soot that is created during the burning of the fuel. Compounds related to soot, such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrated PAHs, are also reduced.\n\nThe oxygenates commonly used are either alcohols or ethers:\n\nIn the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency had authority to mandate that minimum proportions of oxygenates be added to automotive gasoline on regional and seasonal basis from 1992 until 2006 in an attempt to reduce air pollution, in particular ground-level ozone and smog. In addition to this North American automakers have in 2006 and 2007 promoted a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, marketed as E85, and their flex-fuel vehicles, \"e.g.\" GM's Live Green, Go Yellow campaign. U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards give an artificial 54% fuel efficiency bonus to vehicles capable of running on 85% alcohol blends over vehicles not adapted to run on 85% alcohol blends. There is also alcohols' intrinsically cleaner combustion, however due to its lower energy density it is not capable of producing as much energy per gallon as gasoline. Much gasoline sold in the United States is blended with up to 10% of an oxygenating agent. This is known as oxygenated fuel and often (but not entirely correctly, as there are reformulated gasolines without oxygenate) as reformulated gasoline. Methyl \"tert\"-butyl ether (MTBE) was the most common fuel additive in the United States, prior to government mandated use of ethanol.\n\n"}

According to Guppy and Shepard (2001), its specific name \"phlaeas\" is said to be derived either from the Greek \"phlego\", \"to burn up\" or from the Latin \"floreo\", \"to flourish\".\n\nThe upperside forewings are a bright orange with a dark outside edge border and with eight or nine black spots. The hindwings are dark with an orange border. Some females also have a row of blue spots inside the orange border and are known as form \"caeruleopunctata\". The undersides are patterned in a similar way but are paler. The black spots on the forewings are outlined in yellow and the dark colouring is replaced by a pale brownish grey. The hindwings are the same brown/grey colour with small black dots and a narrow orange border. The caterpillars (larvae) are usually green, but some have a purple stripe down the middle of the back and along each side.\nIt is a Holarctic species, widespread and common across Europe, Asia, North America, and also found in North Africa south through to Ethiopia.\n\nIt can be found almost anywhere in south/central England and Wales although never, it seems, in large numbers. Its distribution becomes more patchy in northern England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nIt is found in a wide variety range of habitats from chalk downlands, heathland, woodland clearings to churchyards and waste ground in cities.\n\nIn bright sun it is a very active little butterfly with the males setting up small territories which they will defend vigorously against rival males or indeed any unlucky passing insect. Even the shadow of a large bird passing overhead is enough to elicit a response. Females are pursued and mating usually occurs in vegetation.\n\nThe eggs are laid singly and conspicuously on the upperside of food plant leaves and the young caterpillar feeds on the underside of the leaf creating \"windows\" by leaving the upper epidermis of the leaf untouched. Pupation takes place in the leaf litter and the pupa is thought to be tended by ants. There are between two and three broods a year, fewer further north. In exceptionally good years, a fourth brood sometimes occurs in the south and adults can still be seen flying into November. The species overwinters as a caterpillar.\nDepending on the habitat, common sorrel (\"Rumex acetosa\") and sheep's sorrel (\"Rumex acetosella\") are the two main food plants, although other docks (\"Rumex\" species) are occasionally used.\n\n\"Lycaena phlaeas\" belongs to the subgenus \"Lycaena\" and is the type-species of genus \"Lycaena\". The species is in turn divided into several subspecies, although many probably lack reason to be named, and others may merit an elevation of rank to be considered autonomous species:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is an adaptation of the Lorraine Hansberry play \"A Raisin in the Sun;\" the musical's book was co-written by Hansberry's husband, Robert Nemiroff. \n\nThe story concerns an African-American family in Chicago in 1951. The musical was nominated for nine Tony Awards, winning two, including Best Musical, and the Broadway production ran for 847 performances.\n\nIn Chicago in 1951, an African-American family, Ruth Younger, her husband Walter Lee Younger, their son Travis and Walter's mother are living in a cramped apartment. Walter is a chauffeur but thinks that his father's life insurance policy proceeds will buy a way to a better life. He plans on buying a liquor store, but his mother Mama Lena Younger is against the selling of liquor. Tensions arise as Walter tries to convince Mama Lena to forget her dream of buying the family its own small house (\"A Whole Lotta Sunlight\").\n\nWalter decides to make the deal for the liquor store and signs the papers with his partners Bobo Jones and Willie Harris. Beneatha Younger, Walter's sister, is in college and is romantically involved with an African exchange student, Asagai. When Walter comes home drunk he joins Beneatha in a celebratory dance, picturing himself as a chieftain (\"African Dance\"). Ruth and Walter fight about their future but they reconcile (\"Sweet Time\"). Mama arrives to announce that she has bought a house in the white neighborhood of Clybourne Park, and Walter leaves in anger (\"You Done Right\").\n\nWalter has not returned home and Mama finds him in a bar. She apologizes and gives him an envelope filled with money. She asks him to deposit $3,000 for Beneatha's college education, and tells him the rest is for him. As the family packs to move, a representative of Clybourne Park, Karl Lindner, arrives and offers to buy back the house. Walter, Ruth and Beneatha mockingly tell Mama of the enlightened attitude of their new neighbors. Just then Bobo arrives to tell the family the bad news that Willie has run off with the money. This forces Walter to contact Lindner and accept the offer to buy back the house. Although Beneatha berates her brother for not standing up for principles, Mama shows compassion and understanding (\"Measure the Valleys\").\n\nWhen Lindner arrives, Walter announces that the family will, after all, move to the new house.\n\n\n\nThe musical began a pre-Broadway tryout on May 30, 1973 at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C.. It premiered on Broadway at the 46th Street Theatre on October 18, 1973, transferred to the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on January 13, 1975, and closed on December 8, 1975 after 847 performances. Donald McKayle was the director and choreographer, and the cast featured Virginia Capers as Lena, Joe Morton as Walter, Ernestine Jackson as Ruth, Debbie Allen as Beneatha, Ralph Carter as Travis, Helen Martin as Mrs. Johnson, and Ted Ross as Bobo. Capers later starred in the national tour. The production won the Tony Award for Best Musical and Virginia Capers won a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical.\n\nThe International City Theatre in Long Beach, California presented the musical in February and March 2003.\n\nThe Court Theatre in Chicago staged the musical from September 14 through October 22, 2006. The cast included Ernestine Jackson, who formerly had played Ruth, in the role of Lena Younger.\n\nIn reviewing a performance in Washington (Arena Stage), Clive Barnes of \"The New York Times\" called it \"a warm and loving work.\" In his review of the Broadway production, Barnes noted that the book of the musical \"is perhaps even better than the play... 'Raisin' is one of those unusual musicals that should not only delight people who love musicals, but might also well delight people who don't\".\n\nAfter the Broadway opening, Walter Kerr of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"The strength of \"Raisin\" lies in the keen intelligence and restless invention of a musical underscoring that has simply invaded Lorraine Hansbury's once tightly-knit, four-walled, close-quartered play, \"A Raisin in the Sun\", plucking the walls away, spilling the action onto the streets with a jittery down-flight of strings, mocking and matching realistic speech with frog-throated sass from the heavy-breathing viols.\" \"The New York Times\" also reported that there are \"ovations every night at the 46th Street Theatre for 'Raisin'. But they are for the cast, not individual performers. There are no stars... It was at the Arena Theater in Washington, where the play first opened this spring, that Mr. McKayle said he started evolving the ensemble-acting concept.\"\n\n"}

The name is a play on the word F-Stop.\n\nThe F-Spot project was started by Ettore Perazzoli and is maintained by Stephen Shaw. F-Spot is written in the C# programming language using Mono.\n\nBefore its shutdown and discontinuation in 2017, F-Spot was the standard image tool for several GNOME based distributions. Even before that, Fedora replaced F-Spot with Shotwell in Fedora 13. Ubuntu has done the same as of 10.10 Maverick Meerkat.\n\nThere is some new work to update f-spot and potentially bring it to Windows and Mac.\n\nF-Spot aimed to have an interface that is simple to use but also facilitate advanced features such as tagging images, and displaying and exporting image metadata in Exif and XMP formats.\n\nAll major photographic image formats are supported, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, DNG, GIF, SVG and PPM, as well as several vendor-specific RAW formats (CR2, PEF, ORF, SRF, CRW, MRW and RAF). As of 2008, the RAW formats were not editable with F-Spot. However, newer releases of F-Spot have the DevelopInUFRaw extension, which calls on UFRaw for the conversion work, and then re-imports the resulting JPEG back into F-Spot as a new version of the original RAW.\n\nPhotos can be imported directly from the camera. The driver support is provided by libgphoto2. The GNOME desktop environment can also optionally detect if a camera or a memory card has been attached, and import images to F-Spot automatically.

It lies about 12 km north of Karlsruhe and is the site of the northern campus of a research centre Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (with the Forschungsreaktor 2 (FR2). In the west, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen borders on the Rhine River.\n\nThe two villages that make up the incorporated municipality evolved from medieval villages specializing in freshwater fishing and farming. Today, gravel extraction for construction purposes is important to the local economy, as is the cultivation of white asparagus (Spargel). Because of its location in the Rhine valley, hot humid summers are the norm for Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen. Numerous public beaches exist on the shores of artificial lakes that have been formed by extensive gravel extraction. Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen has numerous active community associations and sports clubs. Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen is home to the Sportpark Fassbender, a noted tennis school and training facility.\n\nAn automobile and pedestrian ferry crossing across the Rhine River runs from Leopoldshafen to Leimersheim. The town is served by routes S1 and S11 of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn, which is operated by the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft over the \"Hardtbahn\".

The USGA typically called the event the U.S. Amateur Public Links, which it has registered as a service mark. The tournament was devised as a championship for golfers who played on public courses, as members of private clubs were barred from entry. In February 2013, the USGA announced that the event would be discontinued after its 2014 edition, and would be replaced by a new men's amateur four-ball championship.\n\nThe first Public Links was held in 1922 at the Ottawa Park Course in Toledo, Ohio. The event grew over time, from 140 entries in 1922 to over 6,000 in 1998.\n\nThe Publinx was created to provide an outlet for national competition for public-course golfers because at that time, entry to the U.S. Amateur was restricted to members of clubs that were affiliated with the USGA or (presumably) other national governing bodies. However, in 1979, entry to the U.S. Amateur was opened to all amateurs, whether or not they were club members. When the USGA announced the demise of the Publinx, it specifically stated that \"the APL [Amateur Public Links] and WAPL [Women's Amateur Public Links] championships no longer serve their original mission because of the widespread accessibility public-course golfers today enjoy in USGA championships.\"\n\nEligibility was similar to that for the U.S. Amateur. Golfers must follow the USGA's guidelines for amateur status, which, in general, exclude anyone who has ever played or taught golf for money. The Public Links, like the U.S. Amateur, had no age limit. However, there were two key differences in the eligibility criteria for the Public Links:\nThe Public Links was open to men and women, although very few women ever entered. In 2005, 15-year-old Michelle Wie became the first woman to advance to the match-play portion of the tournament. She was also the first woman to ever qualify for any USGA championship typically played by men.\n\nEntrants qualified to play in the U.S. Amateur Public Links by playing one of many qualifying tournaments held at sites around the United States with players completing 36 holes of stroke play in one day. The 64 qualifiers played in the tournament proper which began with three rounds of stroke play to narrow the field to 16 players who then competed in a single-elimination match play tournament. Each match was 18 holes except the championship match which was 36 holes; before 2001, the final was an 18-hole match.)\n\nThe winner of the event earned an invitation to the following year's Masters Tournament, if he/she was still an amateur at the time of the Masters.\n\nThe 2005 edition, held in Lebanon, Ohio, drew an unusually large amount of media attention due to Michelle Wie's presence. She had stated on several occasions that she wished to one day play in the Masters, and this event was generally considered to be her best chance to qualify. Wie advanced to the match play rounds, losing in the quarterfinals to Clay Ogden, who went on to win the tournament.\n\nThe analogous event for women was the U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links, established in 1977 and also discontinued after 2014 and replaced by a women's four-ball tournament.\n\nTrevor Immelman became the first winner of the Public Links to win a Major Championship with his victory at the 2008 Masters Tournament. His playing partner in the final round, Brandt Snedeker, was also a past Public Links winner.\n\n\n"}

The latter has been declining in many European countries, due to habitat loss. Currently \"L. dispar\" is in severe decline in northwest Europe, but expanding in central and northern Europe.\n\nArmenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Poland, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.\n\nIt is regionally extinct in the United Kingdom, due to habitat loss. As well it has been extinct in the British Isles, since the 1860s, with declining numbers occurring across numerous, other western European countries.\n\n\nThe subspecies \"Lycaena dispar batava\" is only found in marshy areas in North West Overijssel (the areas Weerribben and Wieden) in the Netherlands. Furthermore, it only feeds on \"Rumex hydrolapathum\", making it a vulnerable subspecies. To protect the subspecies, there is a conservation plan, mainly aimed at expanding its habitat.\n\nVarious species of Lepidoptera are described across Europe. \"Lycaena dispar\" was first recorded in 1749, from the Huntingdonshire fens, England. Documentation of the large copper was done by the Committee appointed by the Entomological Society of London for the Protection of British Lepidoptera.\n\nBritain first attempted to reintroduce \"L. dispar\" in 1901, when G.H. Verbal released a number of caterpillars in Wicken Fen; however, due to a lack of host plants, the reintroduction was not viable. The first successful reintroduction of the species came in 1913, when W.B. Purefoy, established a colony of \"L. d. rutilus\" in Greenfields, Tipperary, a small bog made suitable for \"L. dispar\" through the planting of preferred food plants.\n\nIn 1915, \"L. d. batavus\" was described in the Netherlands, despite being almost indistinguishable from extinct \"L. d. dispar.\" \"L. d. batavus\" populations in Britain, occurred in the fenland area around Whittlesea Mere, extending to Yaxley and Holme Fens, all are characterized by acidic peat bogs, however this population is currently extant.\n\n\"L. dispar\", is widely distributed in central Europe, as far north as southern Finland, extending across temperate Asia to the Amur region and to Manchuria Korea. Occurring throughout much of mainland Europe, \"L. dispar\", is found between 40° and 60° latitudes.\n\nIn central Europe L. dispar commonly inhabits drier areas, such as fallows and urban wetlands.\n\n\"L. dispar\" is one of the newer lepidopteran fauna in Estonia. It was absent from the area up until the 20th century, when it was recorded in 1947, close to the town of Tartu, in the eastern part of Estonia. Over Recent decades the species has remained absent on the islands off the Estonian western coast, scarce in the western regions, and has been expanding into the northwestern part of the country. \"L. dispar\", has been considered univoltine, in Estonia, with a flight time between the end of June and to the end of July. In Estonia the butterfly has two primary host plants, \"R. crispus\" and \"R. obtusifolius\". Notably, \"L. dispar\" has been considered an expansive species, in Estonia, with the acquired status of a widespread butterfly. As a result, \"L. dispar\" is not restricted by habitat requirements, as is common in other populations of \"L. dispar\" across Europe.\n\nIn the Netherlands populations of \"L. dispar\" appear to be more monophagous on \"R. hydrolapathum\".\n\n\"L. dispar\" is characteristically oligophagous on various \"Rumex\" species.\n\nThe British subspecies of this butterfly (\"L. d. dispar\") has been extinct since 1864. Most of our knowledge of its life cycle and ecology comes from studies of the similar subspecies (\"L. d. batava\"') found in the Netherlands. The species can be identified by the silvery hindwing undersides, from the large specimens of the related, more common, drier habitat species \"Caena virgaureae\" and \"Lycaena hippothoe\".\n\n\"L. dispar\" is a wetland species in decline throughout Europe. The primary habitat of this butterfly has been drained for agricultural and other land usage, limiting their habitat. When it can, \"L. dispar\" will utilize plants growing away from watersides and among reed-fen vegetation. In this way \"L. dispar\" can avoid possible flooding that can occur in lower lying areas closer to the water's edge. The species prefers undisturbed grasslands along the riverbanks and stream banks, where its larval food plant, the greater water dock, (\"R. hydrolapathum\") can be found.\n\nWarmer microclimates, as well as warmer regions in general are preferred by \"L. dispar,\" allowing for faster growth time of larvae.\n\nLand disturbances through agriculture, primarily the mowing of grass, and other foliage has a negative influence on populations of \"L. dispar\", such that mowing shortly after egg-laying, will result in disastrous losses due to the eggs being destroyed and the newly hatched larvae being deprived of host plants, for food: \"L. dispar\" lays its eggs on host food plants, commonly low-lying, with larval migration limited to the area around their birth, host plant. For conservation purposes, it is highly recommended that \"L. dispar\" habitats be closely managed, with promotion in increased habitat heterogeneity, being most important: this strategy has proven beneficial for many other species of butterfly.\n\nThe greater water dock, (\"Rumex\") is host plant of \"L. dispar\", with a broad range of species in the Eastern part of its distribution, and a more limited range of species in its Western distribution. Plant specifications, such as height, size, phonological stages (increase in variables is preferable) and nutrition, as \"L. dispar\" is sensitive to its host plants acidity, are all conditions that are taken into consideration when a females chooses host plants to lay her eggs on: these plant will also provide emerging larvae with a source of food.\n\nFavourable host plants include \"R. cripus\", the preferred food plant in southwest Germany and Austria, \"R. obtusifolius\", being the preferred food plant in Southwest France, \"R. patientia\", and the lesser common \"R. hydrolapathum\", which is the main food plant in the butterflies northwestern range (Poland and North Germany), where decline in populations has been most severe, and \"R. stenophyllus\". Other commonly distributed \"Rumex\" species, that are used by \"L. dispar\" are: \"R. obtusifolius\", \"R. conglomeratus\", \"R. sanguineus\", \"R. aquaticus\", \"R. patientia\", and \"R. stenophyllus\". The sorrels, the \"Rumex\" species containing oxalic acid, \"Rumex acetosa,\" have less commonly been reported as host plants for \"L. dispar\".\n\n\"L. dispar\" has a bivoltine life cycle, throughout most of its European distribution, stretching from May to June, and from the end of July to early September, with peak flight occurring in July. Two generations of \"L. dispar\" are standard, the first is characterized by fewer numbers, with the second generation producing more offspring that overwinter, as half-grown, third instar larvae. In the warmer parts (southern distribution) of its European habitat range, \"L. dispar\" can be capable of third generations. During the winter months, larvae enter diapause, a period of metabolic inactivity, that is characterized by the development of physiological tolerance to various environmental stressors: cold temperatures, starvation, in order to survive winter conditions. Overwinter survival can be greatly reduced due to flooding for prolonged periods of time, resulting in high mortality of \"L. dispar\" larvae in diapause.\n\n\"L. dispar\" larvae have three characteristic stages: pre-diapause in the autumn, winter diapause and post-diapause in the spring. Heavy mortality is common between oviposition (when females lay their eggs) in the late summer and the resumption of larval feeding in late spring: larvae begin feeding again in early may. In order to enter diapause, \"L. dispar\" uses temperature and photoperiodic indicators to determine when to start the overwinter process: entering diapause at low temperatures (<15°C) As well as temperature, environmental and endogenous factors also determine when larvae terminate diapause: generally when ambient temperature is high (>25°C).\n\n\"L. dispar\" females are capable of producing on average 32 chorionated eggs per egg load with an average of 714 eggs being laid in their lifetime. Ovipositing females are specific about the quality of host plant they chose to lay their larvae on with plants preferably lacking flowering or fruiting stems and having inflorescences. Plants that receive greater sunlight allow for larvae to grow faster and develop within a shorter period. Females, for this reason prefer warmer microclimates where host plant conditions are optimal. Notably herbivore leaf damage and fungal infections of host plants, are not significant in reducing egg densities, laid by females. In late June, the \"L. dispar\" larvae leave their host, food plant, migrating to vegetation no further than 25cm away from their original host and roughly 10cm above ground. Once there larvae begin to change color, from bright green to pale yellow-brown, allowing them to blend in better with their surroundings during pupation, which lasts between 10 to 14 days.\n\n\"L. dispar\" is subject to predation from invertebrate species as well as parasitoids (\"Phryxe vulgaris\"). During pre-diapause invertebrate predation is responsible for a large proportion of mortality. Parasitoids are commonly found in post-diapause larvae, and results in the death of late, instar larvae. Vertebrate predators often include reed-nesting birds amphibians and small mammals.\n\nThis species was formerly classified as a priority for protection and re-introduction in the UK under its national Biodiversity Action Plan. The species was driven to extinction in Britain by drainage and consequently great reduction of fen habitat. In the rest of the Western Europe, the draining of wetlands and building and agricultural activity on shallow riverbanks has caused a strong decline. In eastern Europe, undeveloped riverbanks and deltas are a habitat for the species, though even there it is somewhat threatened due increasing human influence on these areas.\n\nThere have been several reintroduction attempts to sites in both Britain and Ireland, but these have all ultimately failed. This is largely due to \"L. dispar\" stock being raised in captivity for long periods of time, before being released into the wild, resulting in adults that are maladapted to their natural environment, and ultimately do not survive. Research is now being conducted to see whether a further attempt is worthwhile in more extensive habitats available in the Great Fen project and the Norfolk Broads.\n\nToday, \"L. dispar\" is a near threatened species in some regions, leading to a growing concern over its conservation. It is listed in the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, and is protected via Annexes II and IV of the European Community Habitats Directive. In order to boost population numbers, mass rearing would be beneficial, therefore further research is needed to improve survivorship of mass-reared, \"L. dispar\" individuals. Conservation efforts need to address the species' high sensitivity to climate and land usage, such as reclamation of wetlands for agricultural purposes and intensive management of grasslands through mowing of vegetation, having a negative influences on population numbers of \"L. dispar\".\n\n"}

He was mortally wounded in a duel with fellow general John S. Marmaduke.\n\nLucius Marshall Walker was born in Columbia, Tennessee. He was a nephew of President James K. Polk. Walker graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1850, placing 15th of a class of 44. He was brevetted second lieutenant of dragoons and served on frontier duty in Texas. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1852, shortly before resigning to return to Tennessee, where he established a successful mercantile business.\n\nWalker lived in St. Francis County, Arkansas at the time of his enlistment.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War, Walker was commissioned Colonel of the 40th Tennessee Volunteer Infantry on November 11, 1861. His first assignment was to command the post at Memphis, Tennessee. In 1862, he and his 40th Tennessee were ordered to New Madrid, Missouri to prepare for the Battle of Island Number Ten.\n\nWalker was commissioned brigadier general on March 11, 1862, and was posted at Kentucky Bend, with the command of the 40th Tennessee falling to Lt. Col. C. C. Henderson. He retreated in the face of a much larger Union force, which threatened to capture all of Walker's command. Being forced to surrender at Island #10, Walker was exchanged and rejoined the army at Corinth, Mississippi, before it retreated to Tupelo. At the May 9, 1862, Battle of Farmington, his brigade attacked and drove a Union force from its entrenchments. He was reassigned to the Trans-Mississippi Department on March 23, 1863, commanding a brigade of cavalry under Lt. Gen. Theophilus Holmes at the Battle of Helena.\n\nAfter the Battle of Reed's Bridge on August 26, 1863, Brig. Gen. John S. Marmaduke accused Walker of imperiling Marmaduke's men by being absent from the field in the face of the enemy. Walker, judging from the indications that the enemy was about to flank his position, had withdrawn his troops after dark. Walker felt that he had been unjustly accused of cowardice and challenged Marmaduke to a formal duel. \"I have not pronounced you a coward,\" Marmaduke wrote, \"but I desire to inform you that your conduct as commander of the cavalry was such that I determined no longer to serve you.\" Maj. Gen. Sterling Price ordered both officers to remain in their quarters in an attempt to prevent the duel. However, by an unfortunate series of mishaps, the orders were not delivered to Walker.\n\nAt dawn on Sunday, September 6, Walker and Marmaduke squared off with Colt Navy revolvers on the north bank of the Arkansas River near Little Rock. Both fired and missed. Marmaduke then recocked and fired a second time, mortally wounding Walker in the right side, just above the beltline. Walker forgave Marmaduke when the latter offered his assistance. As General Walker lay dying, his wife rode from St. Francis to Little Rock, and gave birth to their son, Lucius Marshall Walker, Jr.\nLucius M. Walker died at 5 p.m. the next day. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.\n\nGen. Frank C. Armstrong married Maria Polk Walker, daughter of Lucius's brother Confederate Col. Joseph Knox Walker.

She did play some small parts in films from 1962 onward, including a small role in \"Hud\" (1963). Her last role was in \"Evil Spirits\", a 1991 horror film.\n\nVickers was also a singer. In the 1990s, she released a jazz tribute to her parents on CD titled \"A Tribute to Charlie and Maria\". In 2005, she visited Canada for the first time to appear at the Toronto Classic Movie Festival. She appeared with interviewer Tom Weaver on the audio commentary track of the 2007 DVD release of \"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\". She had been writing her autobiography before her death.\n\nIn 1953, Vickers married Don Prell, and they were divorced by 1957. Her second marriage was to Leonard Burns in 1959, divorcing in 1961. Her third and final marriage was to Tom Howland from 1967 to 1969. Vickers had no children. She had a long-term relationship with actor Jim Hutton.\n\nVickers was last seen alive in 2010. She had withdrawn from her extended family, and her mummified body was discovered by actress and neighbor Susan Savage on April 27, 2011, in her home at 10021 Westwanda Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles. The exact date of her death is unknown, but forensic scientists concluded that she may have been dead for as long as a year before her body was discovered. There were no signs of foul play. Her autopsy was completed by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner, who ruled her cause of death to be heart failure resulting from coronary artery disease. Her remains were cremated. Rumors that \"Playboy\" mogul Hugh Hefner paid for Vickers' cremation and funeral were never officially confirmed, although Hefner issued statements expressing his sorrow and outrage at her lonely death. Her half-brother Perry Palmer retained possession of her ashes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2195579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195579", "title": "Small blue", "text": "Small blue\n\nThe small blue (\"Cupido minimus\") is a Palearctic butterfly in the family Lycaenidae. Despite its common name, it is not particularly blue. The male has some bluish suffusion at the base of its upper wings but is mostly dark brown like the female. The species can live in colonies of up to several hundred and in its caterpillar stage is cannibalistic.\n\nSmall blue males are dark brown with a scattering of bright blue scales that speckle their wings. Females lack this blue speckling. Both males and females exhibit the characteristic silver underside with black spots. The male has a bluish tint at the base of its wings similar to the upper side. Their wingspan can fall anywhere from 16-27mm, but males tend to be the smaller sex. Small blues are often confused with the female Osiris Blue, whose coloring is similar to that of the male small blue.\n\n\"C. minimus\" is found in Europe, Asia Minor, Transcaucasia, Tian-Shan, western Siberia, central Siberia, southern Siberia, the Russian Far East, Amur, Mongolia, Magadan and Kamchatka.\n\nThe small blue is known for being the smallest butterfly found in the United Kingdom. It has a very patchy distribution across the UK with its strongholds on the chalk and limestone grasslands of southern England such as the Cotswolds and Salisbury Plain. Across the rest of Britain and Ireland it is often associated with coastal habitats with widely scattered colonies in northern England and the far north of Scotland. It is a Priority Species for conservation in Northern Ireland and under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan.\n\n\"C. minimus\" live in calcareous grasslands, abandoned quarries, railway and embankments and woodland edges and clearings.\n\nRecorded larval food plants are \"Oxytropis campestris\", \"Astragalus alpinus\", \"Lotus corniculatus\", \"Anthyllis vulneraria\", \"Melilotus\", \"Coronilla\", \"Medicago\", \"Anthyllis vulneraria\", \"Astragalus glycyphyllos\" and \"Astragalus cicer\".\n\nIn the UK, small blues lay their eggs, live, and feed exclusively on the kidney vetch. While females obtain all of their nutrients from plants, males will extract salts and minerals from carrion, dung, and mud puddles.\n\nWhen courting, males will find a perch on a covered piece of grass or shrub while waiting for females. During this period, males are very territorial of their perch. Virgin females flying by will mate with the males without elaborate courtship. Mated females will attempt to avoid other males by waiting in the grasses out of sight when a male is nearby.\n\nAfter mating, the female will search for a suitable place to lay a single egg, such as a healthy food plant. Once found, she will lay it between two florets on the flower head in order to keep it mostly hidden, and secure the egg. In order to keep other females from laying eggs on the same flower, the female small blue will rub her abdomen against the florets before she leaves to leave a scent marker. The caterpillars are cannibalistic and will eat one another if multiple hatch on the same flower. However, this scent marker will not last more than a few days, so multiple eggs are often found on a plant.\n\nEggs will typically hatch between one and three weeks, depending on location and temperature. They are .40mm in diameter and .2mm in height. The eggs are light green with white reticulations.\n\nLarvae in the 1st instar are typically very pale blue, almost white, with a black head. When the caterpillar first emerges from the egg, it is about .80mm long and will grow to 1.3 mm by the end of the first instar. They have several small hairs along the length of their bodies. Once hatched, the larvae will eat through the calyx of the plant as well as the young green legumes they are typically laid on. The first instar is also cannibalistic, and will feed on any smaller larvae that cross its path.\n\nDuring the second instar, the caterpillar will grow to about 4mm long. Hairs will begin to grow more densely packed. While the head is still black, the main color is very pale yellow. By this point, the larvae has developed a scent gland on the tenth segment that can be seen pulsing while it moves.\n\nIn this stage, the caterpillars will attack and eat one another. It has more hairs even still and is deeper yellow in color.\n\nBy the fourth instar, the caterpillar is about 1 cm long. They range from pale green to pale yellow, with a dorsal stripe. Come late summer, they will form small cocoons out of silk for hibernation, and will stay motionless for ten months. Their cocoons resemble dead calyces, and thus provide camouflage from predators.\n\nThe pupa stage can last between 1 and 3 weeks, and is usually temperature dependent. Caterpillars will attach themselves, head up, to the underside of a leaf or blade of grass via a silk cincture that is in turn attached to a silk pad. The pupa is light green in color with brown specks and small hair like structures along the width \n\nThe adult small blue has a lifespan of about three months. In the southern United Kingdom, there are two broods a summer. One is in June, and the other in August with the second brood being smaller. However, in the northern part of the United Kingdom, only the June brood is present. The small blue is diurnal, and often lives in colonies. While most colonies consist of a few dozen individuals, colonies of several hundred have been recorded.\n\n\"Cupido minimus trinacriae\" Sicily\n\nIn recent years, the small blue has lost much of its habitat in the United Kingdom, thus making it a Priority Species for conservation in Northern Ireland and under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. It is listed under the 41 species of principal importance under the Schedule 5 of the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act and the 1985 Northern Ireland Wildlife Order.\n\n\n"}

It lies between the Agogna and Terdoppio rivers, in the historical district known as Lomellina, a rice-growing agricultural center. It received the honorary title of city with a royal decree in 1706.\n\nThe town has Roman origins proved by several archaeological discoveries and its first name was Pulchra Silva. After the bloody battle during which Charlemagne defeated the Longobard King Desiderius in 773, its name changed. In the \"Orlando Furioso\" (second canto) it can be read: \nQuivi cader de’ Longobardi tanti,e tanta fu quivi la strage loro,che ‘l loco de la pugna gli abitantiMortara dapoi sempre nominoro.<br><br>Ludovico Ariosto, I cinque canti - canto II, 88\n\nThe prose translation sounds as follows:\"Here so many Longobards died and the slaughter of them was so great here that, from then on, the inhabitants gave the place of the battle the name of Mortara\".\n\nIt prospered as a hunting place of pastimes thanks to Gian Galeazzo Visconti, who decreed unsuccessfully to change its name into Beldiporto (1384). It was transformed by Charles V into a fortress called «The Star» and in 1658 was besieged by the French-Piedmontese Army led by Francesco d'Este. It was restituted to Spain and remained a Spanish possession until 1706, when it was annexed to the Savoy Kingdom. In the same year it became the capital of the Province of Lomellina. On March 21, 1849 it was the site of a bloody Austro-Piedmontese battle just before the defeat of Novara.\n\nMortara is now an agricultural center of national importance for its rice production, but it is also an interesting and tasty gastronomical destination thanks to the goose sausages and products.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2195624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195624", "title": "Liu Feng", "text": "Liu Feng\n\nLiu Feng (died 220) was an adopted son of Liu Bei, a warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty and founded the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period of China. He traced his lineage to a certain marquis whose family name was \"Kou\" (). He was also related to the House of Liu – the imperial clan of the Han dynasty from which Liu Bei descended – albeit not directly. He served as a general in his adoptive father's military forces.\n\nLiu Feng was a descendant of the Marquis of Luo (), whose family name was Kou (). He was also related (but not directly) to the Liu () family of Changsha (長沙; around present-day Changsha, Hunan), who descended from Liu Fa (), one of Emperor Jing's sons. When Liu Bei seized control of four commanderies – Changsha, Lingling (), Guiyang (), Wuling () – in southern Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) in 209, he adopted Liu Feng as his son because he had no suitable heir at the time. In 211, Liu Bei led an army from Jing Province to Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), ostensibly to help Yi Province's governor Liu Zhang counter a rival warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. When war broke out between Liu Bei and Liu Zhang in the following year, Liu Feng, then in his early 20s and famous for his combat skills and great physical strength, led forces from Jing Province together with Liu Bei's other followers to assist his foster father in the Yi Province campaign. Liu Zhang surrendered to Liu Bei in 214, after which Yi Province came under Liu Bei's control. Liu Bei appointed Liu Feng as a Vice-General of the Household ().\n\nIn 219, Liu Bei ordered his general Meng Da to lead an army from Zigui County to attack Fangling County (房陵縣; present-day Fang County, Hubei), which was defended by Kuai Qi (). Meng Da defeated Kuai Qi in battle, conquered Fangling County, and then proceeded to attack Shangyong Commandery (上庸郡; around present-day Zhushan County, Hubei). Liu Bei was worried that Meng Da could not manage alone, so he sent Liu Feng to lead a force from Hanzhong Commandery and sail down the Mian River () to rendezvous with Meng Da at Shangyong. Shen Dan (), the Administrator of Shangyong, surrendered to Meng Da and Liu Feng. For his achievement, Liu Feng was promoted to Vice-General (). Later that year, when Liu Bei's general Guan Yu led an army from Jing Province to attack an enemy garrison at Fan (樊; or Fancheng, present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei), he repeatedly asked Meng Da and Liu Feng to lead reinforcements from Shangyong to support him but they refused, claiming that the situation in Shangyong was not stable yet. Eventually, Guan Yu not only failed to conquer Fan, but also lost his lord's territories in Jing Province in a stealth invasion by Liu Bei's ally Sun Quan, who had turned against Liu. Guan Yu was captured and executed by Sun Quan's forces. Liu Bei resented Liu Feng and Meng Da for not aiding Guan Yu. At the time, Liu Feng had a quarrel with Meng Da. Meng Da became afraid when he heard of Liu Bei's anger towards him and was also worried about his dispute with Liu Feng, so he brought along his followers and defected to the state of Cao Wei, which was established by Liu Bei's rival Cao Pi.\n\nAfter defecting to Wei, Meng Da wrote a letter to Liu Feng, in which he attempted to persuade Liu Feng to join him by noting two important points: Liu Bei already had other sons at the time so he no longer regarded Liu Feng as highly as before; the Wei imperial court was willing to allow Liu Feng to inherit the Luo marquisate which belonged to his biological family. Liu Feng ignored Meng Da's advice and returned to his foster father. Liu Bei reproached his adoptive son for not helping Guan Yu and blamed him for Meng Da's defection. Liu Bei's chancellor, Zhuge Liang pointed out Liu Feng's martial prowess and expressed worries that Liu Feng might become a threat to them if he switched his allegiance to their enemies, hence he urged his lord to eliminate Liu Feng. Liu Bei eventually condemned Liu Feng to death but permitted him to take his own life. Before committing suicide, Liu Feng said, \"I regret not listening to Meng Da!\" Liu Bei shed tears after Liu Feng died.\n\nLiu Feng's son, Liu Lin (), was appointed as an Officer of the Standard () and served in the state of Shu Han – founded by Liu Bei in 221 – in the Three Kingdoms period throughout the reign of Liu Bei's eldest son and successor, Liu Shan. In 264, after the fall of Shu, Liu Lin was ordered to move out of former Shu territory to Hedong Commandery.\n\nIn the historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" by Luo Guanzhong, Liu Feng was adopted after Liu Shan was born, which proved controversial because Liu Bei already had a biological son at the time who was far younger than Liu Feng. Guan Yu, in particular, voiced his opposition, citing the family feud between Liu Biao's sons. However, Liu Feng showed his worth in battle and proved to be a valuable asset to his foster father.\n\nIn 219, when Guan Yu was being surrounded by Sun Quan's forces in Maicheng (), Liu Feng refused to provide reinforcements partly because Meng Da reminded Liu Feng of Guan Yu's disapproval. When the general Liao Hua told Liu Bei that Guan Yu died because Liu Feng and Meng Da did not send reinforcements, Liu Bei began to resent the two and even plotted their arrest. Meng Da became afraid and defected to the state of Cao Wei and sent Liu Feng a message, urging him to defect as well. In anger, Liu Feng executed the messenger and went to battle Meng Da, who was now aided by the Wei generals Xu Huang and Xiahou Shang. As Liu Feng was out of the city, the defender Shen Dan surrendered to Wei and shot arrows at Liu Feng's men. Defeated, Liu Feng returned to Chengdu with only slightly more than a hundred horsemen.\n\nLiu Feng sought an interview with Liu Bei, but gained scant sympathy. In response to Liu Feng's petition, Liu Bei instructed the executioners to expel Liu Feng and put him to death. Liu Bei felt some regret later when he heard of Liu Feng's staunch rejection of Meng Da's enticement. This, adding to the recent death of Guan Yu, made Liu Bei grieve until he fell sick.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2195626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195626", "title": "Battalion Wars", "text": "Battalion Wars\n\nBattalion Wars, released as in Japan, is a real-time tactics game developed by Kuju Entertainment, and released by Nintendo for the GameCube in 2005. It is a spin-off of the \"Advance Wars\" series. The player controls a vast array of units ranging from infantry, armoured divisions and aircraft, completing missions through a mixture of unit management and strategic planning. In the game's story, the player operates as a commander of a battalion, who initially take part in a conflict between two nations that culminates in an eventual alliance between them, in response to a surprise attack by a third nation.\n\nThe game received generally favorable reviews upon release, and led to the creation of a sequel, entitled \"Battalion Wars 2\", for the Wii in 2007.\n\nOver 10 years after the games release there remains an online community of people whom aim to modify the game's source code to create playable \"mods\". To play online games using auxiliary third party servers, and to generally discuss the game and its development.\n\nThe game features only a single-player campaign, played from a third-person perspective, in which players take control of a variety of units that form a battalion, to complete a series of missions. Gameplay features a mixture of elements from both third-person shooters and real-time tactics games. In each mission, players complete a series of objectives, both primary and secondary, earning a rank depending on the final score they achieve, much like in \"Advance Wars\", determined in three categories - Power is determined by how many enemy units were destroyed in the mission; Technique is determined by how many of the player's units survived; and Speed is determined by how long it took the player to complete a mission, against the mission's Par time. While the campaign's missions focus primarily on controlling forces from one of the game's four factions, bonus missions are unlocked if the player achieves an average score for a set of missions, allowing them to take control of troops from one of the other four factions.\n\nFor each mission, the player is given a variety of units to utilise, including infantry, armoured vehicles, and aircraft (with the exception of Air Transports), in which the number and types that can be used vary between missions; more troops can be earned as reinforcements depending on the player's progress in a mission or from capturing POW camps and helipads. While one single unit is controlled fully by the player, whom the camera focuses primarily on, the rest are given orders by the player that range from following them, moving to a location, holding ground, or guarding another unit, to attacking enemy units and structures. Players can give orders to the whole battalion, a company of the same units, or individual units, allowing for flexibility and strategic planning for upcoming engagements, depending on a given situation (i.e. defending a location). While the camera is focused on the player's unit, it can be freely switched between an over-the-shoulder viewpoint, to a battlefield overview viewpoint. The in-game HUD comprises a mini-radar that denotes the location of objectives, and units - friendly, allies, and hostile - along with the battalion bar at the bottom, which lists the units and the number in a company that the player has. In addition to the HUD, the player can also pause the game to review Mission Logs, Objectives, and view the map of the mission's battlefield, allowing them to locate the position of units and current objectives.\n\nUnits featured in the game are based on those from the \"Advance Wars\" series, though \"Battalion Wars\" features unique units, including: light and heavy recon units; a wider variety of infantry units that cover basic riflemen, to units specialised against particular units (i.e. anti-air), and long-range mortar companies; \"battlestation\" tanks; and \"stratodestroyer\" aircraft. Units function similarly to their counterparts in \"Advance Wars\", though with some differences. Infantry units can use cover to reduce the threat of enemy fire, can man mounted gun emplacements, and can be healed individually by collecting first aid kits dropped by eliminated enemy infantry. Furthermore, some objectives require players to take control of certain points (represented as flags), which only infantry can capture. Vehicle and air units, along with their primary weapons and abilities, have manned machine guns that work autonomously against enemy units, and can be repaired by picking up jerry cans dropped by destroyed enemy vehicles. With the exception of ground vehicles, players gain additional controls when taking full control of an infantry unit, allowing them to jump over obstacles and dodge enemy fire by rolling to the side, while taking control of an air unit allows them to adjust its altitude in order to avoid enemy fire.\n\nThe game's world consists of five nations, spread across two large continents and a series of islands and archipelagos. The western continent consists of a mixture of rugged canyons in the west and wide plains and forests, to frozen tundra and snowy mountains and forested valleys in the east. The continent is shared between the Western Frontier in the west, based upon the United States and whom the player controls throughout the campaign, and the Tundran Territories in the east, based upon Russia. The eastern continent consists of a desert province in the west, called the Dune Sea, and a large gothic-themed landscape in the east, which is home to the nation of Xylvania, a country based on a mixture of pre-World War I Germany, modern Romania, vampires, and Gothic themes. The southern seas consist of several islands, including a large archipelago to the south of the western continent, which is home to the Solar Empire, a nation based upon Japan with a mixture of traditional Japanese and high-tech futuristic themes.\n\nThe game's main protagonists are the commanding officers of the Western Frontier - General Herman, the leader of the Frontier forces; Colonel Austin, a resourceful officer; and Brigadier Betty, a young, energetic woman, whose uniform is based on a cheerleaders outfit. Leading the Tundran Territories are its officers - Tsar Gorgi, the country's former ruler who believes in strength; Marshall Nova, Gorgi's son and successor, devoted to modern progress and peace; and Major Nelly, an experienced female officer. leading the Solar Empire is its ruler, Empress Lei-Qo - a wise woman with mystical powers. Their main antagonists are the commanding officers of Xylvania - Kaiser Vlad, the country's ruler; Kommandant Ubel, a hulking monster of a man; and Countess Ingrid, a devoted female pilot veteran.\n\nFollowing a previous war between the Western Frontier and Tundran Territories, both sides maintain an uneasy truce with each other, while maintaining a constant vigil of each other's forces at the demilitarized zone along their borders. General Herman, head of the Frontier's armies, agrees to a suggestion made by his subordinate, Brigadier Betty, to hold a military exercise for their troops to ensure they remain fit for duty. During the exercise, a recon scout spots several Tundran armored divisions invading their territories at the command of Tsar Gorgi. Having recently been succeeded by his son Marshal Nova as the country's new political and military leader, Gorgi despised the promise of peace between the two nations and decided to strengthen his nation's might by secretly invading and defeating the Frontier, effectively ending the truce between the two nations. Learning of his father's actions, Nova forbids Gorgi from participating further in the war he started, determined to end the conflict himself with his second-in-command, Major Nelly, leading Tundran forces.\n\nAs the Frontier forces begin to start winning the conflict, defeating Tundran forces in a series of battles, Gorgi travels to Xylvania, a country that had been ravaged by the rivalry of the two nations, to form a pact with its leader Kaiser Vlad. However, Vlad betrays him by having bombers, commanded by his subordinate Countess Ingrid, attack both armies. Horrified by this, Gorgi goes into exile out of shame for his actions. Weakened after the Xylvanian assault, both Herman and Nova call a ceasefire between their armies, effectively ending the conflict. Both nations decide to join forces, forming the Alliance of Nations, in order to retaliate against the Xylvanians as they prepare to attack both countries.\n\nSeeking to weaken their enemies, the Alliance conducts operations within the Dune Sea, in order to prevent their enemies from drilling for nerocite, an essential resource used as vehicle fuel. Despite difficulties in their final battle, the Alliance is aided by Gorgi, after he comes out of exile to assist in the conflict in his own personal fighter. Although the Xylvanians are driven out for good, Gorgi is mortally wounded by Vlad's right-hand man Kommandant Ubel. Before dying, Gorgi apologizes to Nova for his actions, leaving his son to vow for revenge for his father's death. Learning that the Xylvanians seek to invade the Solar Empire, Colonel Austin, a Frontier officer, has the Alliance make contact with its leader, Empress Lei-Qo, in order to offer assistance in repelling Vlad's invasion, in exchange for her assistance in invading Xylvania.\n\nAs the Alliance begins invading into Xylvanian territory, Ingrid decides to take action to stop the invasion. Stealing an ancient sword from Vlad, Ingrid uses it to awaken the country's ancient army, known as the Iron Legion. In doing so, Ingrid is driven insane by the Legion's power, causing her to attack both the Alliance and Xylvanian forces. Finding themselves forced to stop the Legion, the Alliance fights towards the Legion's source of power, the Cenotaph, and destroy it. In the wake of its destruction, Lei-Qo arrives and kills Ingrid, ending her madness and the threat of the Legion. Following the conflict, the Alliance finally reaches the Xylvanian capital of Vladstag, and defeat the last remaining forces guarding it. Although Vlad escapes, the Alliance captures Ubel, imprisoning him. With the Xylvanians defeated, the Alliance celebrates the end of the war, though Nova points out to Betty that his father left him a parting lesson - in order for him to strive for peace, he must be prepared for war.\n\nThe game was originally titled \"Advance Wars: Under Fire\" during development and was originally planned to be tie into the \"Advance Wars\" series of games. However, its concept never intended to have this connection in mind, and because of its otherwise unrelated gameplay elements and storyline, the title was ultimately changed for Western release to avoid connections to the \"Advance Wars\" branding, while the Japanese version was released under the \"Famicom Wars\" branding.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of three eights and one seven for a total of 31 out of 40.\n\n\"X-Play\" complemented the game's emphasis on strategy and third person shooting as well as its cartoonish art style while criticizing the sometimes clunky controls and lack of multiplayer.\n\nThere is a sequel to \"Battalion Wars\", entitled \"Battalion Wars 2\" for the Nintendo Wii, with a storyline that continues shortly after where the original \"Battalion Wars\" leaves off. The sequel delves further into the backstory and includes more territories, along with introducing new land, air, and sea vehicles for the players to utilize.\n\n"}
