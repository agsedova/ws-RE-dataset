{"id": "2174084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174084", "title": "Ntozake Shange", "text": "Ntozake Shange\n\nNtozake Shange ( ; October 18, 1948 – October 27, 2018) was an American playwright and poet. As a Black feminist, she addressed issues relating to race and Black power in much of her work. She is best known for her Obie Award-winning play, \"For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf\". She also penned novels including \"Sassafrass, Cypress & Indigo\" (1982), \"Liliane\" (1994), and \"Betsey Brown\" (1985), about an African-American girl runaway from home. Among Shange's honors and awards were fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund, and a Pushcart Prize. In April 2016, Barnard College announced it had acquired Shange's archive. Shange lived in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nShange was born Paulette Linda Williams in Trenton, New Jersey , to an upper-middle-class family. Her father, Paul T. Williams, was a surgeon, and her mother, Eloise Williams, was an educator and a psychiatric social worker. When she was aged eight, Shange's family moved to the racially segregated city of St. Louis. As a result of the \"Brown v. Board of Education\" court decision, Shange was bused to a white school where she endured racism and racist attacks.\n\nShange's family had a strong interest in the arts and encouraged her artistic education. Among the guests at their home were Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Chuck Berry, and W. E. B. Du Bois. From an early age, Shange took an interest in poetry. While growing up with her family in Trenton, Shange attended poetry readings with her younger sister Wanda (now known as the playwright Ifa Bayeza). These poetry readings fostered an early interest for Shange in the South in particular, and the loss it represented to young Black children who migrated to the North with their parents. In 1956, Shange's family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where Shange was sent several miles away from home to a non-segregated school that allowed her to receive \"gifted\" education. While attending this non-segregated school, Shange faced overt racism and harassment. These experiences would later go on to heavily influence her work.\n\nWhen Shange was 13, she returned to Lawrence Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, where she graduated in 1966 from Trenton Central High School. In 1966, Shange enrolled at Barnard College (class of 1970) at Columbia University in New York City. During her time at Barnard, Shange met fellow Barnard student and would-be poet Thulani Davis. The two poets would later go on to collaborate on various works. Shange graduated \"cum laude\" in American Studies, then earned a master's degree in the same field from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. However, her college years were not all pleasant. She married during her first year in college, but the marriage did not last long. Depressed over her separation and with a strong sense of bitterness and alienation, she attempted suicide. In 1971, having come to terms with her depression and alienation, Shange changed her name. In Zulu, \"Ntozake\" means \"she who comes with her own things\" and \"Shange\" means \"who walks like a lion\" .\n\nIn 1975, Shange moved back to New York City, after earning her master's degree in American Studies in 1973 from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California. She is acknowledged as having been a founding poet of the Nuyorican Poets Café. In that year her first and most well-known play was produced — \"for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf\". First produced Off-Broadway, the play soon moved on to Broadway at the Booth Theater and won several awards, including the Obie Award, Outer Critics Circle Award, and the AUDELCO Award. This play, her most famous work, was a 20-part choreopoem — a term Shange coined to describe her groundbreaking dramatic form, combining of poetry, dance, music, and song — that chronicled the lives of women of color in the United States. The poem was eventually made into the stage play, was then published in book form in 1977. In 2010, the choreopoem was adapted into a film (\"For Colored Girls\", directed by Tyler Perry). Shange subsequently wrote other successful plays, including \"Spell No. 7\", a 1979 choreopoem that explores the Black experience, and an adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's \"Mother Courage and Her Children\" (1980), which won an Obie Award.\n\nIn 1978, Shange became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Shange taught in the Creative Writing Program at the University of Houston from 1984 to 1986. While there she wrote the ekphrastic poetry collection \"Ridin the Moon in Texas: Word Paintings\" and served as thesis advisor for poet and playwright Annie Finch. In 2003, Shange wrote and oversaw the production of \"Lavender Lizards and Lilac Landmines: Layla's Dream\" while serving as a visiting artist at the University of Florida, Gainesville.\n\nShange's individual poems, essays, and short stories have appeared in numerous magazines and anthologies, including \"The Black Scholar\", \"Yardbird\", \"Ms.\", \"Essence Magazine\", \"The Chicago Tribune\", \"VIBE\", \"Daughters of Africa\", and \"Third-World Women\".\n\nThe Black Arts Movement—also known as BAM—has been described as the \"aesthetic and spiritual sister of the Black Power concept.\" The Black Arts Movement is a subset of the Black Power Movement. Larry Neal described the Black Arts Movement as a \"radical reordering of the western cultural aesthetic.\" Key concepts of BAM were focused on a \"separate symbolism, mythology, critique, and iconology\" as well as the African American's desire for \"self-determination and nationhood.\" BAM consisted of actors, actresses, choreographers, musicians, novelists, poets, photographers, and artists. Though male artists such as Amiri Baraka heavily dominated the Black Arts Movement, some notable women writers of the movement were Gwendolyn Brooks, Nikki Giovanni, Rosa Guy, Lorraine Hansberry, Lucille Clifton, and Sonia Sanchez, among others. Although Shange is described as a \"post-Black artist,\" her work was decidedly feminist whereas BAM has been criticized as misogynistic and \"sexism had been widely and hotly debated within movement publications and organizations.\" Corresponding with the idea that art from BAM was a \"radical reordering of the western cultural aesthetic,\" Shange herself described her atypical writing style. In regards to her plays, she stated: \"A play has a form that has to be finished. A performance piece has an organic form, but it can even flow. And there doesn't have to be some ultimate climax in it. And there does not have to be a denouement.\"\n\nThough Shange's work did have a \"radical reordering of western cultural aesthetics\" with its spelling, structure, and style, Baraka—one of the leading male figures of the movement denied her as a post-Black artist. In regards to Shange as a part of the black aesthetic and as a post-Black artist, he claimed \"that several women writers, among them Michelle Wallace [sic] and Ntozake Shange, like [Ishmael] Reed, had their own 'Hollywood' aesthetic, one of 'capitulation' and 'garbage.'\" In regards to a black aesthetic, Shange described different styles of writing for different parts of the country. She stated: \"There's not a California style, but there are certain feelings and a certain freeness that set those writers off from those in the Chicago-St. Louis-Detroit tripod group...so that the chauvinism that you might find that's exclusionary, in that triangle, you don't find too much in California.\" Shange set her writing apart from the Black aesthetic of the Black arts movement by creating a \"special aesthetic\" for black women \"to an extent.\" She claimed, \"the same rhetoric that is used to establish the Black Aesthetic, we must use to establish a women's aesthetic, which is to say that those parts of reality that are ours, those things about our bodies, the cycles of our lives that have been ignored for centuries in all castes and classes of our people, are to be dealt with now.\"\n\nShange died in her sleep on October 27, 2018, aged 70, in an assisted-living facility in Bowie, Maryland. She had been ill, having suffered a series of strokes in 2004, but she \"had been on the mend lately, creating new work, giving readings and being feted for her work.\" Her sister Ifa Bayeza (with whom she co-wrote the 2010 novel \"Some Sing, Some Cry\") was quoted as saying: \"It's a huge loss for the world. I don't think there's a day on the planet when there's not a young woman who discovers herself through the words of my sister.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The latter was later used as the sampling background track to Soulsearcher's 1999 #20 Club Play hit, \"Can't Get Enough\".\n\nIn the 1980s Gary's Gang enjoyed further U.S. and European success with the 1982 single \"Knock Me Out\" (#45 UK) and the 1983 hit \"Makin' Music\", which reached #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Brian Chin of \"Billboard\" described \"Knock Me Out\" to be \"midtempoed and very pop, it shares much of the soft-edged production styling and doowoppish vocals of the group's earlier work.\"\n\nGary's Gang was the brainchild of Joseph Tucci and Gary Turnier who put the group together when they sold \"Keep on Dancin\" to Sam Records in Long Island City, states Gary Turnier (Gary's Gang). The song was written, produced and recorded in Tucci's Richmond Hill garage. All vocals were sung by Tucci, who also played all the instruments (except for the drums which were played by Gary Turnier). After Gary Turnier shopped the song to all major labels for several weeks, Sam Records picked up the record for release.

He was born in Clermont-Ferrand, France. Édouard and his elder brother André served as co-directors of the Michelin company.\n\nEdouard seemed destined for a career as an artist, but around 1888 he and his brother Andre returned to Clermont-Ferrand in order to try to save the failing family business, then a manufacturer of agricultural tools, drive belts and hoses. In 1889, he improved greatly on the design of the pneumatic tyre for bicycles, making tyres easier to change and repair. The invention proved its worth in the Paris–Brest cycle event organized by the newspaper \"Le Petit Journal\" in September 1891, and Michelin quickly adapted his inflatable tyres for use on motor vehicles, of which France was becoming the world's leading producer. Success came rapidly, and already in 1896 approximately 300 Paris taxis were running on Michelin pneumatic tyres. His company went on to experience tremendous growth serving the fledgling industry around the turn of the century and beyond.\n\nIn the traumatic weeks that followed the German invasion of May/June 1940, world events overshadowed Michelin's death. Nevertheless, by the time he died he had built Michelin into a major industrial force, with many \"firsts\" in wheel and tyre technology to its credit. He had overseen the acquisition of the (then bankrupt) Citroën business in 1934: with his son Pierre and their friend Pierre-Jules Boulanger he secured its position as one of Europe's most innovative auto-makers in the 1940s and 1950s, producing models such as the Citroën Traction, the revolutionary Citroën TUB/TUC light van and the 2CV prepared for introduction at the 1939 Paris Motor Show (which was cancelled at short notice, the war causing the launch of the little car to be deferred).\n\nÉdouard Michelin also lived a long life and suffered the personal tragedies of being predeceased by two of his sons, Étienne Michelin having been killed in a flying accident in 1932 and Pierre Michelin having been killed in a road accident near Montargis in 1937. Like many industrialists, Michelin was a member of the anti-Semitic anti-Dreyfusard camp during the political turmoil over the Dreyfus affair in turn of the century France.\n\nHis great-grandson, a former CEO and managing partner of the Michelin Group who died on 26 May 2006 in a boating accident, was also named Édouard.\n\nÉdouard and his brother André were inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn, Michigan, in 2002.\n"}

It is Kenya's only tropical rainforest and is said to be Kenya's last remnant of the ancient Guineo-Congolian rainforest that once spanned the continent.\n\nThe forest lies on undulating terrain, mostly between 1500 and 1600 meters elevation. It is in the watershed of the Isiukhu and Yala rivers, which flow through the forest before emptying into Lake Victoria.\n\nThe forest including reserves encloses about 238 square kilometers, a little less than half of which currently remains as indigenous forest. In the north of the forest is the Kakamega National Reserve, given national forest reserve status in 1985. Just to the north is the Kisere Forest Reserve. Throughout the forest are a series of grassy glades, ranging in size from about 1 to 50, with a few larger clearings. The origins of the glades are uncertain. Some are certainly recent clearings, but others predate recent records. These may have originated from past human activity such as cattle grazing or may be the result of herbivory and movements by large mammals such as buffalo and elephants (both now extirpated from the region). The glades vary a great deal in structure, some being open grass and others having a considerable number of trees or shrubs. A number of streams and small creeks run through the reserve. The larger creeks are usually bordered by a few to tens of meters of forest on either side which divide the glades, while the smallest creeks flow through open grasslands, often forming small marshy patches.\n\nThe Kakamega Forest is very wet, with an average of 1200 mm – 1700 mm of rain per year. Rainfall is heaviest in April and May (\"long rains\"), with a slightly drier June and a second peak roughly in August to September (\"short rains\"). January and February are the driest months. Temperature is fairly constant throughout the year, ranging between 20c - 30c.\n\nThe forest lies in the Victoria Basin forest-savanna mosaic ecoregion. The forest's flora and fauna include many species associated with the moist forests of the Guineo-Congolian region, which lie further west in the basin of the Congo River.\n\nFlora found in the park include some of Africa's greatest hard and soft woods: Elgon teak \"(Olea welwitschii)\", red stinkwood \"(Prunus africana)\", white stinkwood, several varieties of croton, and \"Pouteria altissima\". There are 380 recorded species of plants. This includes 60 species of ferns, 150 species of trees and shrubs, and 170 species of flowering plants including 60 species of orchids with 9 species found only in this forest.\n\nThe forest is famous for its birds, 367 bird species have been recorded in the forest such as the west African Great blue turaco and black-and-white-casqued hornbill. At least 9 birds are not found anywhere else.\n\nMammals that occur in the park include bush pig, duikers, bushbuck, African clawless otter, mongoose, giant African water shrew, squirrels, tree pangolin, porcupine, bats and a variety of primates including the blue monkey, redtail monkey, De Brazza's monkey, baboon, potto and the occasional vervet monkey. Leopards have been occasionally reported, but the last official sighting was in 1991\n\nInsects are abundant and some are quite spectacular, such as Goliath beetles, pink and green flower mantis, and numerous colorful butterflies (489 species). Particularly well represented groups are ants (Formicidae), Lepidopterans, Orthopterans, and beetles. Gastropods, millipedes and spiders are also common.\n\nThe flora and fauna of Kakamega Forest has not been extensively studied.\n\nMany local inhabitants rely on the forest to supply important resources, such as firewood, building poles and traditional medicines. Cattle grazing occurs in some of the glades. The region is said to be one of the most densely populated rural areas in the world, and pressure on the forest resources is considerable. The German funded project BIOTA East worked in the forest from 2001 until 2010, creating forest inventories for many life forms and aiming to find strategies for a sustainable use of the forest.\n\nThe Southern part of Kakamega forest, Isecheno Forest station run by the Kenya Forest Service is the most accessible in Tourism. There is the well known Mama Mtere tree, a historic tree and the most photographed tree in Kakamega forest, there are also strangler fig trees.\n\nThere are hiking trails in the forest that allow for forest walking, camping, hiking, primate watching, bird and butterfly watching, game watching and village walks.

In Buddhism the loss of all names and forms leads to the realization of the Ultimate reality of ‘Shunyatha’ or ‘Emptiness’ or Nirvana “Naked Truth” removed of Maya.\n\nThis term is used in Buddhism to refer to the constituents of a living being: \"nāma\" refers to the mental, while \"rūpa\" refers to the physical. The Buddhist \"nāma\" and \"rūpa\" are mutually dependent, and not separable; as \"nāmarūpa\", they designate an individual being. Namarupa are also referred to as the five skandhas, \"the psycho-physical organism\", “mind-and-matter,” and “mentality-and-materiality”.\n\nIn the Pali Canon, the Buddha describes \"nāmarūpa\" in this manner (English on left, Pali on right):\nElsewhere in the Pali Canon, \"nāmarūpa\" is used synonymously with the five aggregates.\n\nIn keeping with the doctrine of anātman/anatta, \"the absence of an (enduring, essential) self\", \"nāma\" and \"rūpa\" are held to be constantly in a state of flux, with only the continuity of experience (itself a product of dependent origination) providing an experience of any sort of conventional 'self'.\n\nNāmarūpa is the fourth of the Twelve Nidānas, preceded by consciousness (Pali: \"viññāna\"; Skt.: \"vijñana\") and followed by the six sense bases (Pali: \"\"; Skt: \"\"). Thus, in the Sutta Nipata, the Buddha explains to the Ven. Ajita how samsaric rebirth ceases:\n\nThe term \"nāmarūpa\" is used in Hindu thought, \"nāma\" describing the spiritual or essential properties of an object or being, and \"rūpa\" the physical presence that it manifests. These terms are used similarly to the way that 'essence' and 'accident' are used in Catholic theology to describe transubstantiation. The distinction between nāma and rūpa in Hindu thought explains the ability of spiritual powers to manifest through inadequate or inanimate vessels - as observed in possession and oracular phenomena, as well as in the presence of the divine in images that are worshiped through pūja.\n\nNāma Rupatmak Vishva is the Vedanta (a school of Sanatana Dharma/Hinduism) term for the manifest Universe, viz. The World as we know it. Since every object in this World has a Nāma and Rupa, the World is called Nāma Rupatmak Vishva. The Paramātma (or Creator) is not manifest in this Nāma Rupatmak Vishva but is realized by a Sādhaka(student) by means of Bhakti (devotion), Karma (action), Jnana (knowledge), Yoga (Union, a Hindu school), or a combination of all of these methodologies.\n\n\n"}

Bonilla near Puebla, Puebla, Mexico. It handles national and international air traffic for the city of Puebla.\n\nIt also serves as an alternate airport for Mexico City, being part of the metropolitan airport group for the Mexican capital, comprising the airports of Mexico City, Toluca, Cuernavaca and Querétaro. The airport used to be a hub for Puebla Air Lines before it ceased operations in 1995.\n\nThe airport was inaugurated on 18 November 1985 and since 2001, was given in concession to Operadora Estatal de Aeropuertos (OEA) for operation and development. OEA is a company founded specifically to manage and carry out investments to extend airport facilities. The following entities take part in OEA's establishment:\n\n\nIn 2003, the US Trade and Development Agency (TDA) provided a grant for US $550,000 to OEA to enable the completion of a project feasibility study regarding the upgrade of the Puebla International Airport. OEA subsequently retained the services of The Louis Berger Group Inc. from the US to complete the study, which concludes that in the long term the airport might serve up to 15 million passengers annually considering that Puebla constitutes the fourth largest city in Mexico in terms of population.\n\nIn recent years, the Puebla International Airport has showed a notable growth in passenger volume, operations and freight. In 2007 the Logistic Airport Center was opened offering all the facilities for the managing and commercial processing of cargo.\n\nPresently, the airport has reached historical levels in its operative indicators. This situation has permitted members of the Board of Directors to support the decision to begin immediate actions to increase the capacity of the airport in the platforms areas and the Passenger Terminal Building as well.\n\nOne of the fastest growing airports in the country, Puebla air terminal served 685,583 passengers in 2018 and 761,575 in 2019.\n\nTo arrive at Puebla International Airport there are two main approaches: the first one is through the Mexico - Puebla toll motorway taking the road out at San Miguel Xoxtla and across the Tlaltenango town; the second choice is driving along the Cholula - Huejotzingo boulevard to the access road to the airport, just a bit before coming the village of Huejotzingo, the third option is passing Xoxtla on the Puebla-Mexico tollway and following the Airport exit some kilometers before to reach San Martin Texmelucan.\n\nAt the moment, the airport is equipped with a 6 position platform of category D and a terminal building with capacity to take care of 450 passengers per hour.\n\nThe new terminal building will be roughly 226% larger than the current one. By investing over USD $15 million, it will be possible to serve 1.1 million passengers in one year. This amount might be even higher assuming a proper air operation distribution.\n\nThis airport handles two thousand tons a year in textile products, vehicle motor parts, machinery, post pieces, airborne parcels service and perishables such as fruits and flowers.\n\nAn airport lounge at this airport is operated by Global Lounge Network.\n\nAs of May 12, 2012, the airport has been closed several times due to volcanic ash from Popocatépetl volcano.\n\n\n"}

The ceiling fan and mechanical wall fans are also appliances often operated by pull switches. Pull switches may be either two-position (open or closed) or multi-position (allowing for different fan speeds or levels of illumination).\n\nMounted inside a pull switch, there could be two types of two-position toggle switches. (In both cases the stable physical open- or closed -situation would be switch in outer and string in upper position.) One type would switch to closed (alternatively open) already during the initial pull in the string. The other type would switch to closed (or open) only when releasing \"after\" a full pull. With the first type, the weight of the string and handle could accidentally switch the load intermittently on and off, when still around the initial position (depending on the internal spring). This could potentially increase the danger of overheating in the switch.\n\nIn a damp environment, electrical pull switches have a safety advantage because the user is separated from the electricity by a significant distance and if the lead is made of an electrically insulating material, such as cotton string.\n\nMost commercially available pull switches use a short length of ball chain, which may then be connected to any number of optional leads for added length or decoration. Leads for decoration or utility are usually made of metal or plastic. They can come in many different shapes ranging from animals, geometric shapes, or look just like a weight.\n\n\n"}

It is a large and poorly understood '\"micromoth\" superfamily, constituting one of the basal lineages of the Ditrysia.\n\nAs of the 1990s, this superfamily was composed of about 1,425 genera and 16,250 species. It was estimated that only 25% of the species diversity of Gelechioidea had been described. If this estimate is accurate, Gelechioidea will be one of the largest superfamilies of Lepidoptera.\n\nThe name \"curved-horn moths\" refers to one of the few conspicuous features found in (almost) all Gelechioidea, and, at least in the more extreme developments, unique to them: the labial palps are well-developed (though not thickened), and form more or less gently curved protrusions whose end has a drawn-out, pointed tip. Their proboscis is generally well-developed, allowing for long-lived imagines (adults); the proximal part of the proboscis is scaly. Otherwise, the Gelechioidea vary extensively in habitus; most have small hind-wings with long, hairy fringes, though these are not easily seen in the living animal as they are tucked under the fore-wings at rest. The body is usually quite compressed, either dorsoventrally or laterally.\n\nThe phylogeny and classification of the Gelechioidea remains a subject of considerable dispute. For example, the Elachistidae were at one time used as a sort of \"wastebin taxon\" to unite as subfamilies a variety of plesiomorphic members of this superfamily, which do not actually seem to form a monophyletic group. Many of these have now been moved to the Oecophoridae, but others are almost certainly likely families in their own right, while additional ones may well be so.\n\nIn 2011 the superfamily was divided into 21 families, based mainly on morphological studies, with adjustments made for some molecular studies. The number of genera and an estimate of the species number are given in parentheses.\n\n\nHowever, a later phylogenetic analysis of the Gelechioidea, using a morphological and molecular dataset, proposed a revision into 16 families, with the status of two further families, Schistonoeidae and Epimarptidae, unclear.\n\n See also for comparison of some approaches to gelechioid systematics and taxonomy.\n\n"}

Such a structure can be defined by means of an atlas, such that one can pass from chart to chart in it by piecewise linear functions. This is slightly stronger than the topological notion of a triangulation.\n\nAn isomorphism of PL manifolds is called a PL homeomorphism.\n\nPL, or more precisely PDIFF, sits between DIFF (the category of smooth manifolds) and TOP (the category of topological manifolds): it is categorically \"better behaved\" than DIFF — for example, the Generalized Poincaré conjecture is true in PL (with the possible exception of dimension 4, where it is equivalent to DIFF), but is false generally in DIFF — but is \"worse behaved\" than TOP, as elaborated in surgery theory.\n\nSmooth manifolds have canonical PL structures — they are uniquely \"triangulizable,\" by Whitehead's theorem on triangulation — but PL manifolds do not always have smooth structures — they are not always \"smoothable.\" This relation can be elaborated by introducing the category PDIFF, which contains both DIFF and PL, and is equivalent to PL.\n\nOne way in which PL is better behaved than DIFF is that one can take cones in PL, but not in DIFF — the cone point is acceptable in PL.\nA consequence is that the Generalized Poincaré conjecture is true in PL for dimensions greater than four — the proof is to take a homotopy sphere, remove two balls, apply the \"h\"-cobordism theorem to conclude that this is a cylinder, and then attach cones to recover a sphere. This last step works in PL but not in DIFF, giving rise to exotic spheres.\n\nNot every topological manifold admits a PL structure, and of those that do, the PL structure need not be unique — it can have infinitely many. This is elaborated at Hauptvermutung. The Kirby–Siebenmann class is an obstruction for giving a topological manifold a PL-structure.\n\nThe obstruction to placing a PL structure on a topological manifold is the Kirby–Siebenmann class. To be precise, the Kirby-Siebenmann class is the obstruction to placing a PL-structure on M x R and in dimensions n > 4 this ensures that M has a PL-structure.\n\nAn A-structure on a PL manifold is a structure which gives an inductive way of resolving the PL manifold to a smooth manifold. Compact PL manifolds admit A-structures. Compact PL manifolds are homeomorphic to real-algebraic sets. Put another way, A-category sits over the PL-category as a richer category with no obstruction to lifting, that is BA → BPL is a product fibration with BA = BPL × PL/A, and PL manifolds are real algebraic sets because A-manifolds are real algebraic sets.\n\n\n\n"}

As a scholar, he is credited along with Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat, with being instrumental in turning East Asian Studies into scientific disciplines with critical methods.\nH.J. Klaproth was usually known as Julius or Julius von Klaproth. His name also erroneously appears as \"Julius Heinrich Klaproth\".\nKlaproth was born in Berlin on 11 October 1783, the son of the chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who is credited with the discovery of four elements including uranium.\n\nYoung Klaproth devoted his energies in quite early life to the study of Asiatic languages, and published in 1802 his \"Asiatisches Magazin\" (Weimar 1802–1803). He was in consequence called to St. Petersburg and given an appointment in the academy there. In 1805 he was a member of Count Golovkin's embassy to China. On his return he was despatched by the academy to the Caucasus on an ethnographical and linguistic exploration (1807–1808), and was afterwards employed for several years in connection with the academy's Oriental publications. In 1812 he moved to Berlin.\n\nIn 1815 he settled in Paris, and in 1816 Humboldt procured him from the king of Prussia the title and salary of professor of Asiatic languages and literature, with permission to remain in Paris as long as was requisite for the publication of his works. He died in Paris on 28 August 1835.\n\nKlaproth was an orientalist or an \"Asiatologist,\" in that he had a good command not only of\nChinese, but also Manchu, Mongolian, Sanskrit, Turkish, Arabic, Persian, and even Caucasian languages. His wide range of interests encompassed the study of the development of individual countries in their Asian context, which contrast with the 21st century focus on specialization.\n\nKlaproth's 1812 \"Dissertation on language and script of the Uighurs\" (\"Abhandlung über die Sprache und Schrift der Uiguren\") was disputed by Isaak Jakob Schmidt, who is considered the founder of Mongolian Studies. Klaproth asserted that the Uighur language was a Turkic language, while Schmidt was persuaded that Uighur should be classified as a \"Tangut\" language.\n\nKlaproth's bibliography extends to more than 300 published items.\n\nHis great work \"Asia Polyglotta\" (Paris, 1823 and 1831, with Sprachatlas) not only served as a résumé of all that was known on the subject, but formed a new departure for the classification of the Eastern languages, more especially those of the Russian Empire. To a great extent, however, his work is now superseded.\n\nThe \"Itinerary of a Chinese Traveller\" (1821), a series of documents in the military archives of St. Petersburg purporting to be the travels of George Ludwig von , and a similar series obtained from him in the London foreign office, are all regarded as spurious.\n\nKlaproth's other works include:\n\nKlaproth was also the first to publish a translation of \"Taika\" era Japanese poetry in the West.

Its members are predominantly advanced undergraduates (juniors and seniors) who have demonstrated exceptional academic performance and engagement in international affairs. These individuals are guided by faculty advisors from over 140 colleges and universities with established chapters.\n\nSigma Iota Rho was founded on May 9, 1984, on the initiative of scholars and practitioners who sought a national platform to recognize excellence in international affairs and foster values in the field. Aptly, the Greek letters representative of the society is: sigma (Σ) denotes \"synesis,\" meaning \"prudence\"; iota (I) for ideodoi, \"ideals\"; and rho (P) for rhomi, \"power.\"\n\nAmong the founders of ΣΙΡ was the late-Dr. William C. Olson, Ph.D., then-dean of the School of International Service at American University, who served as its first president. Also among the group was Theodore Couloumbis, Ph.D., who determined the society's Greek letters and identity.\n\nCurrently, the president and national director of SIR are Dr Frank Plantan, Ph.D., co-director of the University of Pennsylvania's International Relations Program.\n\nMembers of Sigma Iota Rho take part in advancing the honour society's cause for furthering study and awareness of international affairs. To this end, they collaborate yearly to produce the \"Journal of International Relations, \"the leading undergraduate periodical in its field. Additionally, the national office of the honour society administers an award scheme that funds worthy research projects by fellow members. At the local level, ΣΙΡ's chapters routinely host extracurricular events in enriching local campus and communities. Typically these include hosting speaker events, networking events, and fundraising drives for a particular global issue or cause.\n\nInduction is based on standards similar to those of Phi Beta Kappa. Students with outstanding academic credentials in international relations, global affairs, and other majors in the domain of international studies are nominated by their local chapters for induction into Sigma Iota Rho. Generally, they undergraduates who are in the top percentiles of their classes and areas of study.\n\nNominees are submitted to the national office of the honour society for verification and approval. Upon induction, students have issued a certificate confirming membership, regalia for graduation ceremonies, and invited to participate in the organization's national networking group on LinkedIn.\n\nIn effort to distinguish the efforts of those whom serve as models of the honor society, the national office announced in summer 2012 national commendations, the \"Faculty Advisor\" and \"Featured Chapter\" Awards. The first recipient of the faculty distinction was Francine D'Amico, Ph.D., advisor of Syracuse University's chapter, Alpha Chi—housed in the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs—which won the Featured Chapter Award.\n\nThe premier undergraduate peer-reviewed periodical for international affairs, the \"Journal of International Relations \"(ISSN 2159-1741)\" \"has a physical circulation of over 3,000 copies to over 150 institutions affiliated with Sigma Iota Rho and the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs.

They both determine the accounting period in which revenues and expenses are recognized. According to the principle, revenues are recognized when they are realized or realizable, and are earned (usually when goods are transferred or services rendered), no matter when cash is received. In cash accounting – in contrast – revenues are recognized when cash is received no matter when goods or services are sold.\n\nCash can be received in an earlier or later period than obligations are met (when goods or services are delivered) and related revenues are recognized that results in the following two types of accounts:\nRevenue realized during an accounting period is included in the income.\n\n\"The Critical-Event Approach:\"\nIFRS provides five criteria for identifying the critical event for recognizing revenue on the sale of goods:\n\nThe first two criteria mentioned above are referred to as Performance. Performance occurs when the seller has done most or all of what it is supposed to do to be entitled for the payment. E.g.: A company has sold the good and the customer walks out of the store with no warranty on the product. The seller has completed its performance since the buyer now owns good and also all the risks and rewards associated with it.\nThe third criterion is referred to as Collectability. The seller must have a reasonable expectation of being paid. An allowance account must be created if the seller is not fully assured to receive the payment. The fourth and fifth criteria are referred to as Measurability. Due to Matching Principle, the seller must be able to match expenses to the revenues they helped in earning. Therefore, the amount of Revenues and Expenses should both be reasonably measurable\n\nReceived advances are not recognized as revenues, but as liabilities (deferred income), until the conditions (1.) and (2.) are met.\n\nRecognition of revenue from four types of transactions:\n\n\"Accrued revenue\" (or \"accrued assets\") is an asset such as proceeds from a delivery of goods or services, at which such income item is earned and the related revenue item is recognized, while cash for them is to be received in a later accounting period, when its amount is deducted from \"accrued revenues\". It shares characteristics with \"deferred expense\" (or \"prepaid expense\", or \"prepayment\") with the difference that an asset to be covered later is cash paid out to a counterpart for goods or services to be received in a later period when the obligation to pay is actually incurred, the related expense item is recognized, and the same amount is deducted from \"prepayments\"\n\n\"Deferred revenue\" (or \"deferred income\") is a liability, such as cash received \"from a counterpart for goods or services\" which are to be delivered in a later accounting period, when such income item is earned, the related revenue item is recognized, and the \"deferred revenue\" is reduced. It shares characteristics with \"accrued expense\" with the difference that a liability to be covered later is an obligation to pay for goods or services received solo \"from a counterpart\", while cash for them is to be paid out in a later period when its amount is deducted from \"accrued expenses\".\n\nFor example, a company receives an annual software license fee paid out by a customer upfront on the January 1. However the company's fiscal year ends on May 31. So, the company using accrual accounting adds only five months worth (5/12) of the fee to its revenues in profit and loss for the fiscal year the fee was received. The rest is added to \"deferred income\" (liability) on the balance sheet for that year.\n\nAdvances are not considered to be a sufficient evidence of sale, thus no revenue is recorded until the sale is completed. Advances are considered a deferred income and are recorded as liabilities until the whole price is paid and the delivery made (i.e. matching obligations are incurred).\n\nThe rule says that revenue from selling inventory is recognized at the point of sale, but there are several exceptions.\n\nThis exception primarily deals with long-term contracts such as constructions (buildings, stadiums, bridges, highways, etc.), development of aircraft, weapons, and space exploration hardware. Such contracts must allow the builder (seller) to bill the purchaser at various parts of the project (e.g. every 10 miles of road built).\n\nThis method allows recognizing revenues even if no sale was made. This applies to agricultural products and minerals. There is a ready market for these products with reasonably assured prices, the units are interchangeable, and selling and distributing does not involve significant costs.\n\nSometimes, the collection of receivables involves a high level of risk. If there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding collectibility then a company must defer the recognition of revenue. There are three methods which deal with this situation:\n\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB and IASB issued converged guidance on recognizing revenue in contracts with customers. The new guidance is heralded by the Boards as a major achievement in efforts to improve financial reporting. The update was issued as Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09. It will be part of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) as Topic 606: \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (ASC 606)\",\" and supersedes the existing revenue recognition literature in Topic 605 issued by FASB. ASC 606 is effective for public entities for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017; non-public companies were allowed an additional year.\n\nThe new standard aims to:\nThe new revenue guidance was issued by the IASB as IFRS 15. The IASB’s standard, as amended, is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted.\n"}
{"id": "2174223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174223", "title": "Alucitoidea", "text": "Alucitoidea\n\nAluctoidea is the superfamily of many-plumed and false plume moths. These small moths are most easily recognized by their wings. These each consist of many (typically more than 3) narrow strips of membrane around the major veins, instead of a continuous sheet of membrane between the veins. In living moths in the wild, this is often hard to see however. When they are at rest, the \"plumes\" partly overlap, appearing as solid wings. But even then, they can be recognized by the wings having a marked lengthwise pattern and uneven edge.\n\nThey contain two families at most:\n\nSometimes, only one family is accepted, Tineodidae being merged into Alucitidae with the Alucitoidea thus becoming monotypic. Most of the roughly 160 described species in the superfamily belong to the many-plumed moths; these include a few rather widespread genera. The false plume moths consist of numerous small and well-distinct lineages; none of their genera have managed to become as successful as the Alucitidae.\n\nEven though they are \"micromoths\", the Aluctoidea are not especially primitive Lepidoptera; the sizable carpenter moths (Cossidae) as well as the butterflies are not particularly distant relatives. The closest living relatives of the Aluctoidea, however, seem to be the plume moths (Pterophoroidea), which like the many-plumed moths have wings consisting each of several narrow straps (though less strikingly so than in the Aluctoidea). However, the taxonomic treatment of the many-plumed moths among the Ditrysia is disputed, mostly because of their unclear relationship to the fruitworm moths (Copromorphoidea).\n\nIn the arrangement used here, the Copromorphoidea are considered obtectomeran Ditrysia, significantly more advanced than the Aluctoidea (which certainly belong to the basal lineages of Apoditrysia). Some authors disagree and instead assume the Copromorphoidea to be closer relatives of the Alucitidae than even the Tineodidae and Pterophoroidea. This splits the many-plumed moths into two lineages, the Alucitidae (as well as the fringe-tufted moths, Epermeniidae) being included in an expanded Copromorphoidea, and the Tineodidae affiliated with the plume moth instead. The subfamily Alucitoidea is thus abandoned in this approach. The rationale for doing so is the marked similarity of Alucitidae caterpillars and chrysalises to those of Copromorphoidea. But this may simply be convergent evolution or symplesiomorphies, considering that the Copromorphoidea otherwise appear to possess the characteristic synapomorphies of the Obtectomera, which are absent in Aluctoidea.\n\n"}
{"id": "2174225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174225", "title": "The Hub, Edinburgh", "text": "The Hub, Edinburgh\n\nThe Hub is a public arts and events building in the centre of Edinburgh, Scotland. Located at the top of the Royal Mile, it is a prominent landmark as its tall gothic spire is the highest point in central Edinburgh, and towers over the surrounding buildings below Edinburgh Castle. \n\nThe building is a notable example of Gothic Revival architecture and was designed by architects J Gillespie Graham and Augustus Pugin. Constructed between 1842 and 1845, it was originally designed as a meeting hall for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. From 1929 the building was used as a church until the mid-1980s. Today it is the home of the Edinburgh International Festival and is used as a ticket office, information centre and performance venue.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had been meeting in St Giles' Cathedral. At the time, St Giles was divided into four separate churches, each with its own congregation. From 1829-31, St Giles underwent restoration works led by architect William Burn, and the General Assembly had to relocate. \n\nInitially, there were plans to restore the remains of Holyrood Abbey to designs by architects J Gillespie Graham and the renowned gothic revivalist Augustus Pugin to provide a new Assembly Hall, but this did not come to fruition. A new church called Knox Memorial church was being planned at the foot of Castlehill, and foundations had already been laid by Thomas Hamilton in 1829. The General Assembly decided instead to use this site and commissioned Graham to design a new building, known as the Victoria Hall. It was built between 1839 and 1844, and a foundation stone was laid by Queen Victoria in 1843. One of the church congregations from St Giles, the worshippers of the Tollbooth Kirk, also relocated to the new building in 1843.\n\nThe General Assembly met here until 1929, when the Church of Scotland reunited with the United Free Church of Scotland, and the amalgamated church decided to use the former United Free Church's General Assembly Hall on The Mound for future assemblies. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland continues to meet on this site to this day. After 1929 the building was used by various congregations as a place of worship, although it was never actually consecrated as a Church. In 1956 it was named the Highland Tolbooth St John's Church. The congregation had been notable for holding services in Gaelic as well as English.\n\nIn 1979 the Tolbooth congregation united with the nearby Greyfriars Kirk and the Tolbooth Kirk building was closed. The building was then virtually unused until 1999 when it was redeveloped to create offices and a performance space for the Edinburgh International Festival and renamed \"The Hub\". The converted building was ceremonially opened by Queen Elizabeth in 1999.\n\nToday it is the home of the Edinburgh International Festival and is the central ticketing office, information centre and a performance venue for the International Festival. It is a multi-functional building comprising a performance space and venues for functions, conferences and weddings. \n\nThe inside houses the Hub Cafe; the central box office for the International Festival; a performance space with a capacity of 420; and two smaller venues, the Glass Room and the Dunard Library, suitable for smaller events.\n\nPrior to the completion of the new Scottish Parliament Building at Holyrood in 2004, the Hub was occasionally used for meetings of the Scottish Parliament when the Church of Scotland's General Assembly Hall was unavailable. The Parliament returned to the Hub for two weeks following the collapse of a beam in its debating chamber on 2 March 2006.\n\nThe building is situated on a corner site, at the junction of Castlehill, Johnstone Terrace and the Lawnmarket, at the top of the Royal Mile. Its most prominent feature is the belfry/clock tower and tall pinnacled octagonal spire at its east end, overlooking the Lawnmarket. The old Tolbooth Kirk is considered to be a fine example of Gothic Revival architecture and it is noted for its ornately decorated stonework, carved in the Decorated Gothic style with features such as crockets, pinnacles, gablets and lancet windows.\n\nUnusually for a church building, the Victoria Hall was constructed with two floors to accommodate its dual purpose; the ground floor was divided into committee rooms for the General Assembly, and the upper floor was given over to a large chamber which could be used for Christian worship or for the meetings of the General Assembly. Pugin, who had recently designed the Palace of Westminster in London, was experienced in designing buildings that recalled the glories of Medieval Europe, resolved to create a grand, impressive edifice to house the national church of Scotland.\nThe interior of the main hall is decked with an ornate, rib-vaulted ceiling and is lined with carved wood panelling, including a decorated wooden screen, by Pugin and Gillespie Graham. At the east end is an ornate pulpit, topped with a wooden pinnacle, which incorporates elements of the chair of the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, designed by Pugin.\n\n"}

The main character Jet Jungle was created and voiced by Brian O'Shaughnessy.\n\nJet Jungle appeared with his black panther Jupiter, red-headed girlfriend Samantha Muller (Diane Appleby) and scientist and faithful friend Prof. Giuseppe \"Spaghetti\" Valetti (Victor Melleney). The team would routinely fly off from their island headquarters, Orion's Peak, in a Vertijet at the behest of their government liaison \"the Minister\", to battle criminal masterminds and the occasional extraterrestrial menace.\n\nThe show was broadcast every weekday at 4:30 p.m. in the afternoon on South Africa's English radio service, Springbok Radio from 1965 with re-runs continuing until the station's close in 1985. It was also broadcast on Radio Rhodesia in Rhodesia (the present day Zimbabwe). It is not known how many of the episodes were actually recorded, or how many of them were rebroadcast, since so little of the Springbok Radio archive exists. There appear to be screenplays and sound bytes available, and a number of archivists have attempted to preserve the work.\n\nThe enormously successful show, sponsored by Black Cat Peanut Butter and Jungle Oats was used to promote these South African products. Jet Jungle attributed his enormous powers of persuasion to the use of special ingredients, and his mastery of time, caused as a result of exposure to the Star Master, a mysterious entity. They appeared in several episodes similar in vein to the Project Farstar episodes.\nThe long-running show had a children's fan club with regular newsletters featuring a one-page black-and-white comic strip serial, which was syndicated in various publications such as Personality. A short-lived full colour Sunday newspaper comic strip followed. A Jet Jungle action figure was produced by Mego Corporation in the 1970s and \"rediscovered\" by the Mego Museum in 2005.\n\nFor the Silver Jubilee in 1975, Springbok Radio produced a once-off one-hour comedy show titled 'The Great Gong Robbery' which featured (\"inter alia\") a parody of Jet Jungle, who ultimately solves the mystery and exposes Jupiter as the thief.\n\n\nIn 2009, Radio Researchers uncovered several episodes of this program. These are twenty episodes of a storyline entitled 'Project Farstar'.\n\nThe Jet Jungle theme tune is probably the most striking and distinguishing feature of the series, aside from the all-in-one black suit, vertijet and panther.\n\nWords to the Theme tune are: When your world is in trouble / and you need a fighting friend / who will come on the double and keep fighting to the end /Get Jet! Get Jet! / Jet Jungle is the man to get! Jet Jungle. Jet Jungle Jet Jungle is the man to get! / Get Jet!\n\nSince television broadcasts only came to South Africa in 1976, the country had followed the Apollo moon missions on radio. The series thus fed the popular imagination about outer-space and children's delight in hearing what would become a virtual retelling of the saga in the form of a fairy-tale. Africa's participation in the event, which sent Jet Jungle and Jupiter as far out as Andromeda, told of things to come. In Project Far Star, Prof Spaghetti voices his concern about defeating the forces of Einsteinian space-time, \"going out young and coming back old\".\n\nVoices heard on the radio programme include Hal Orlandini, Brian O'Shaughnessy, Diane Appleby\n\n\nThere is only one digital image of the weekly b&w comic available online. Other examples may be viewed in any one of South Africa's legal deposit libraries.\n\n\nBesides the action figure produced by Mego and now recreated by loyal fans, listeners and readers could purchase the \"Jet Jungle Bicycle\" from OK Bazaars, a South African home furnisher. A fan-club image posted online in a Mego forum shows a boy riding an orange chopper.\n\nThere is only one boxed example of the Jet Jungle figure known to exist in the World today. Since its discovery in 2005, this sole example was reputed to have exchanged hands privately at the staggering price of $20,000 us. A price record for a single Mego figure. \n\nThe Jet Jungle Mego figure, a complete boxed edition still with its original packaging, sold for $5,713.98 after 11 bids, on eBay in 2009.\n\nA $15 \"Limited-Edition 8-inch figure of only 500 produced\" was released by TJ Toys sometime after the winning bid. The figure was bagged not boxed.\n\nIn 1971, Martin Abrams began purchasing the license rights to popular movies, comic books and television shows for Mego Corp., a toy manufacturing company. Mego produced a variety of dolls in the 1970s and 1980s until the company went bankrupt in 1983, whereupon the rights to produce the Jet Jungle figurine would ostensibly have reverted to its creator.\n\nThe first Jet Jungle Mego figure to appear on the internet was in 2003 on Megocentral.com. Laurie Halbritter, the then owner of Megocentral.com, purchased one on an auction from Italy. Photos were sent to various collectors but the identity of the figure was not\nconfirmed until the boxed one surfaced in 2005.\n\n"}

The airport is named after President Adolfo López Mateos.\n\nIt is considered as the main alternate airport for Mexico City International Airport since it is only 30 minutes or 40 km away from the Santa Fe financial district and has the longest runway of any airport in Mexico. \n\nConstruction of the airport began in 1970, as ordered by Jorge Jiménez Cantú, as a reliever airport for the Mexico City metropolitan area. It was inaugurated in 1984. \n\nToluca went from serving 145,000 passengers in 2002, to 3,200,000 in 2007 and 4,300,000 in 2008. It used to be a hub for Volaris, but the company announced on March 8, 2011 that its hub in Toluca would switch to Guadalajara. Interjet also moved the bulk of its operations to Mexico City. As a result, the passenger traffic got significantly reduced: from 1,161,064 passengers in 2013 to 689,001 in 2019.\n\nThe airport was reduced from four terminals to two after all domestic operations were handled at the Domestic Terminal. Before 2007, Interjet and Volaris had each one independent terminal, plus Terminal 1 (now Domestic Terminal) and the International Terminal. Recent renovations have expanded both the terminals and apron, making the airport capable of handling an excess of 6 million passengers each year.\n\nAmong the airlines that used to frequent Toluca were Aeroméxico Connect, Click Mexicana, Republicair and TAESA Airlines.

Its exact date is uncertain, but Kālidāsa is often placed in the 4th century AD.\n\nPlots similar to the play appear in earlier texts. There is a story mentioned in the \"Mahabharata\". A story of similar plot appear in the buddhist Jataka tales as well. In the Mahabharata the story appears as a precursor to the Pandava and Kaurava's lineages. In the story King Dushyanta and Shakuntala meet in the forest and get estranged and ultimately reunited. Their son Bharata laid the foundation of the dynasty that ultimately led to Kauravas and Pandavas.\n\nManuscripts differ on what its exact title is. Usual variants are \"Abhijñānaśakuntalā\", \"Abhijñānaśākuntala\", \"Abhijñānaśakuntalam\" and the \"grammatically indefensible\" \"Abhijñānaśākuntalam\". The Sanskrit title means \"pertaining to the recognition of Shakuntala\", so a literal translation could be \"Of Shakuntala who is recognized\". The title is sometimes translated as \"The token-for-recognition of Shakuntala\" or \"The Sign of Shakuntala\". Titles of the play in published translations include \"Sacontalá or The Fatal Ring\" and \"Śakoontalá or The Lost Ring\". A more recent translation by Barbara Stoler Miller (1984) was entitled \"Sakuntala and the Ring of Recollection\".\n\nThe protagonist is Shakuntala, daughter of the sage Vishwamitra and the apsara Menaka. Abandoned at birth by her parents, Shakuntala is reared in the secluded hermitage of the sage Kanva, and grows up a comely but innocent maiden.\n\nWhile Kanva and the other elders of the hermitage are away on a pilgrimage, Dushyanta, king of Hastinapura, comes hunting in the forest. Just as he was about to slay a deer, Vaikhānas, a sage obstructs him saying that the deer was from the hermitage and must not be slayed. He politely requests the king to take his arrow back. The king follows what the sage said. The sage then informs that they are going for collecting firewood for the sacrificial fire and asks him to join them. They then spot the hermitage of Sage Kanva and decide to pay a visit to the hermits. However the king decides to go in the penance groove dressing up like a commoner and also stops the chariot farther away to not disturb the hermits.The moment he enters the hermit and spots Shakuntala, he is captivated by Shakuntala, courts her in royal style, and marries her. He then has to leave to take care of affairs in the capital. She is given a ring by the king, to be presented to him when she appears in his court. She can then claim her place as queen.\n\nThe anger-prone sage Durvasa arrives when Shakuntala is lost in her fantasies, so that when she fails to attend to him, he curses her by bewitching Dushyanta into forgetting her existence. The only cure is for Shakuntala to show him the signet ring that he gave her.\n\nShe later travels to meet him, and has to cross a river. The ring is lost when it slips off her hand when she dips her hand in the water playfully. On arrival the king refuses to acknowledge her. Shakuntala is abandoned by her companions, who return to the hermitage.\n\nFortunately, the ring is discovered by a fisherman in the belly of a fish, and Dushyanta realises his mistake - too late. The newly wise Dushyanta defeats an army of Asuras, and is rewarded by Indra with a journey through heaven. Returned to Earth years later, Dushyanta finds Shakuntala and their son by chance, and recognizes them.\n\nIn other versions, especially the one found in the 'Mahabharata', Shakuntala is not reunited until her son Bharata is born, and found by the king playing with lion cubs. Dushyanta enquires about his parents to young Bharata and finds out that Bharata is indeed his son. Bharata is an ancestor of the lineages of the Kauravas and Pandavas, who fought the epic war of the Mahabharata. It is after this Bharata that India was given the name \"Bharatavarsha\", the 'Land of Bharat'.\n\nBy the 18th century, Western poets were beginning to get acquainted with works of Indian literature and philosophy. \"Shakuntala\" was the first Indian drama to be translated into a Western language, by Sir William Jones in 1789. In the next 100 years, there were at least 46 translations in twelve European languages.\n\n\"Sacontalá or The Fatal Ring\", Sir William Jones' translation of Kālidāsa's play, was first published in Calcutta, followed by European republications in 1790, 1792 and 1796. A German and a French version of Jones' translation were published in 1791 and 1803 respectively. Goethe published an epigram about Shakuntala in 1791, and in his \"Faust\" he adopted a theatrical convention from the prologue of Kālidāsa's play. Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel's plan to translate \"Shakuntala\" in German never materialised, but he did however publish a translation of the \"Mahabharata\" version of Shakuntala's story in 1808. Goethe's epigram goes like this:\n\"Shakuntala\" was disapproved of as a text for school and college students in the British Raj in the 19th century, as popular Indian literature was deemed, in the words of Charles Trevelyan, to be \"marked with the greatest immorality and impurity\", and Indian students were thought by colonial administrators to be insufficiently morally and intellectually advanced to read the Indian texts that were taught and praised in England.\n\nWhen Leopold Schefer became a student of Antonio Salieri in September 1816, he had been working on an opera about Shakuntala for at least a decade, a project which he did however never complete. Franz Schubert, who had been a student of Salieri until at least December of the same year, started composing his \"Sakuntala\" opera,  701, in October 1820. Johann Philipp Neumann based the libretto for this opera on Kālidāsa's play, which he probably knew through one or more of the three German translations that had been published by that time. Schubert abandoned the work in April 1821 at the latest. A short extract of the unfinished score was published in 1829. Also Václav Tomášek left an incomplete \"Sakuntala\" opera.\n\nKālidāsa's \"Shakuntala\" was the model for the libretto of 's first opera, which premièred in 1853. In 1853 Monier Monier-Williams published the Sanskrit text of the play. Two years later he published an English translation of the play, under the title: \"Śakoontalá or The Lost Ring\". A ballet version of Kālidāsa's play, \"Sacountalâ\", on a libretto by Théophile Gautier and with music by Ernest Reyer, was first performed in Paris in 1858. A plot summary of the play was printed in the score edition of Karl Goldmark's Overture to \"Sakuntala\", Op. 13 (1865). Sigismund Bachrich composed a \"Sakuntala\" ballet in 1884. Felix Weingartner's opera \"Sakuntala\", with a libretto based on Kālidāsa's play, premièred the same year. Also Philipp Scharwenka's \"Sakuntala\", a choral work on a text by Carl Wittkowsky, was published in 1884.\n\nBengali translations:\n\nTamil translations include:\n\nFelix Woyrsch's incidental music for Kālidāsa's play, composed around 1886, is lost. Ignacy Jan Paderewski would have composed a Shakuntala opera, on a libretto by Catulle Mendès, in the first decade of the 20th century: the work is however no longer listed as extant in overviews of the composer's or librettist's oeuvre. Arthur W. Ryder published a new English translation of \"Shakuntala\" in 1912. Two years later he collaborated to an English performance version of the play.\n\nItalian Franco Alfano composed an opera, named \"La leggenda di Sakùntala\" (\"The legend of Sakùntala\") in its first version (1921) and simply \"Sakùntala\" in its second version (1952).\n\nChinese translation:\n\nFritz Racek's completion of Schubert's \"Sakontala\" was performed in Vienna in 1971. Another completion of the opera, by Karl Aage Rasmussen, was published in 2005 and recorded in 2006. A scenic performance of this version was premièred in 2010.\n\nNorwegian electronic musician Amethystium wrote a song called \"Garden of Sakuntala\" which can be found on the CD \"Aphelion\". According to Philip Lutgendorf, the narrative of the movie Ram Teri Ganga Maili recapitulates the story of Shakuntala.\n\nIn Koodiyattam, the only surviving ancient Sanskrit theatre tradition, prominent in the state of Kerala on India, performances of Kālidāsa's plays are rare. However, legendary Kutiyattam artist and \"Natyashastra\" scholar \"Nātyāchārya Vidūshakaratnam Padma Shri Guru\" Māni Mādhava Chākyār has choreographed a Koodiyattam production of \"The Recognition of Sakuntala\".\n\nA production directed by Tarek Iskander was mounted for a run at London's Union Theatre in January and February 2009.

It is commonly prescribed for balance disorders or to alleviate vertigo symptoms, e.g. those associated with Ménière's disease. It was first registered in Europe in 1970 for the treatment of Ménière's disease.\n\nBetahistine is used in the treatment of Ménière's disease and vertigo. The supporting evidence for the efficacy of betahistine for Ménière's disease is of poor quality. A 2011 Cochrane review of seven trials consisting of 243 patients with Ménière's disease concluded that there was insufficient evidence for any beneficial effect of betahistine on symptoms. Most of the trials found a reduction in symptoms of vertigo and to a lesser extent tinnitus, but these effects may have been due to bias in study methodology.\n\nBetahistine is contraindicated for patients with pheochromocytoma. Patients with bronchial asthma or a history of peptic ulcer need to be closely monitored.\n\nPatients taking betahistine may experience following side effects:\n\n\nBetahistine may also cause several digestive-related side effects. The package insert for Serc, a trade name for betahistine, states that patients may experience several gastrointestinal side effects. These may include nausea, upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramping. These symptoms are usually not serious and subside between doses. Patients experiencing chronic digestive problems may lower their dose to the minimum effective range and by taking betahistine with meals. Additional digestive problems may require that patients consult their physician in order to find a possible suitable alternative.\n\nPeople taking betahistine may experience several other side effects ranging from mild to serious. The package insert for Serc states that patients may experience nervous-system side effects, including headache. Some nervous system events may also partly be attributable to the underlying condition rather than the medication used to treat it. The study by Jeck-Thole and Wagner also reports that patients may experience headache and liver problems, including increased liver enzymes and bile-flow disturbances. Any side effects that persist or outweigh the relief of symptoms of the original condition may warrant that the patient consult their physician to adjust or change the medication.\n\nBetahistine is a strong antagonist of the histamine H receptor and a weak agonist of the histamine H receptor.\n\nBetahistine has two mechanisms of action. Primarily, it is a weak agonist on the H receptors located on blood vessels in the inner ear. This gives rise to local vasodilation and increased permeability, which helps to reverse the underlying problem of endolymphatic hydrops.\n\nMore importantly, betahistine has a powerful antagonistic effects at H receptors, thereby increasing the levels of neurotransmitters histamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and GABA released from the nerve endings. The increased amounts of histamine released from histaminergic nerve endings can stimulate receptors. This stimulation explains the potent vasodilatory effects of betahistine in the inner ear, that are well documented.\n\nBetahistine seems to dilate the blood vessels within the inner ear which can relieve pressure from excess fluid and act on the smooth muscle.\n\nIt is postulated that betahistine's increase in the level of serotonin in the brainstem inhibits the activity of vestibular nuclei.\n\nBetahistine comes in both a tablet form as well as an oral solution, and is taken orally. It is rapidly and completely absorbed. The mean plasma elimination half-life is 3 to 4 hours, and excretion is virtually complete in the urine within 24 hours. Plasma protein binding is very low. Betahistine is transformed into aminoethylpyridine and hydroxyethylpyridine and excreted with the urine as pyridylacetic acid. There is some evidence that one of these metabolites, aminoethylpyridine, may be active and exert effects similar to those of betahistine on ampullar receptors.\n\nBetahistine chemically is 2-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]pyridine, and is formulated as the dihydrochloride salt. Its chemical structure closely resembles those of phenethylamine and histamine.\n\nBetahistine is marketed under a number of brand names, including Veserc, Serc, Hiserk, Betaserc, and Vergo.\n\nBetahistine is widely used and available in Europe, including in the United Kingdom. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the early 1970s for Ménière's disease, but approval was later withdrawn for lack of evidence of efficacy. The withdrawal was upheld by a US court of appeals in 1968.\n"}

{"id": "2174245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174245", "title": "Indian painting", "text": "Indian painting\n\nIndian painting has a very long tradition and history in Indian art, though because of the climatic conditions very few early examples survive. The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of pre-historic times, such as the petroglyphs found in places like Bhimbetka rock shelters. Some of the Stone Age rock paintings found among the Bhimbetka rock shelters are approximately 30,000 years old.\n\nIndia's ancient Hindu and Buddhist literature has many mentions of palaces and other buildings decorated with paintings, but the paintings of the Ajanta Caves are the most significant of the few ones which survive. Smaller scale painting in manuscripts was probably also practised in this period, though the earliest survivals are from the medieval period. A new style was introduced with Mughal painting, representing a fusion of the Persian miniature with older Indian traditions, and from the 17th century its style was diffused across Indian princely courts of all religions, each developing a local style. Company paintings were made for British clients under the British raj, which from the 19th century also introduced art schools along Western lines. This led to modern Indian painting, which is increasingly returning to its Indian roots.\nIndian paintings can be broadly classified as murals, miniatures and paintings on cloth. Murals are large works executed on the walls of solid structures, as in the Ajanta Caves and the Kailashnath temple. Miniature paintings are executed on a very small scale for books or albums on perishable material such as paper and cloth. Traces of murals, in fresco-like techniques, survive in a number of sites with Indian rock-cut architecture, going back at least 2,000 years, but the 1st and 5th-century remains at the Ajanta Caves are much the most significant.\n\nPaintings on cloth were often produced in a more popular context, often as folk art, used for example by travelling reciters of epic poetry, such as the Bhopas of Rajasthan and Chitrakathi elsewhere, and bought as souvenirs of pilgrimages. Very few survivals are older than about 200 years, but it is clear the traditions are much older. Some regional traditions are still producing works.\n\nIt seems clear that miniature painting, often illustrating manuscripts, has a very long history, but Jain miniatures from about the 12th century, mostly from West India, and slightly earlier Buddhist ones from the Pala Empire in the east are the oldest to survive. Similar Hindu illustrations survive from about the 15th century in the west, and 16th century in East India, by which time the Mughal miniature under Akbar was also sometimes illustrating translations into Persian of the Hindu epics and other subjects.\n\nThe great period of Mughal court painting begins with the return of Humayun from exile in Persia 1555, bringing Persian artists with him. It ends during the reign of Aurangzeb who rather disapproved of painting for religious reasons, and disbanded the large imperial workshop, by perhaps 1670. The artists dispersed to smaller princely courts, both Muslim and Hindu, and the \"post-Mughal\" style developed in many local variants. These included different Rajasthani schools of painting like the Bundi, Kishangarh, Jaipur, Marwar and Mewar. The Ragamala paintings also belong to this school, as does the later Company painting produced for British clients from the mid-18th century.\n\nModern Indian art has seen the rise of the Bengal School of art in 1930s followed by many forms of experimentations in European and Indian styles. In the aftermath of India's independence, many new genres of art developed by important artists like Jamini Roy, M. F. Husain, Francis Newton Souza, and Vasudeo S. Gaitonde. With the progress of the economy the forms and styles of art also underwent many changes. In the 1990s, Indian economy was liberalised and integrated to the world economy leading to the free flow of cultural information within and without. Artists include Subodh Gupta, Atul Dodiya, Devajyoti Ray, Bose Krishnamachari and Jitish Kallat whose works went for auction in international markets. Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional Mithila painting in most contemporary way and created her own style through the exercises of her own imagination, they appear fresh and unusual.\n\nThe pre-historic paintings were generally executed on rocks and these rock engravings were called Petroglyphs. These paintings generally depict animal like bison, beer and tigers etc. The oldest Indian paintings are rock art in caves which are around 30,000 years old, such as the Bhimbetka cave paintings.\n\nThe history of Indian murals starts in ancient and early medieval times, from the 2nd century BC to 8th – 10th century AD. There are known more than 20 locations around India containing murals from this period, mainly natural caves and rock-cut chambers. The highest achievements of this time are the caves of Ajanta, Bagh, Sittanavasal, Armamalai Cave (Tamil Nadu), Ravan Chhaya rock shelter, Kailasanatha temple in Ellora Caves.\n\nMurals from this period depict mainly religious themes of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu religions. There are though also locations where paintings were made to adorn mundane premises, like the ancient theatre room in Jogimara Cave and possible royal hunting lodge circa 7th-century AD – Ravan Chhaya rock shelter.\n\nThe pattern of large scale wall painting which had dominated the scene, witnessed the advent of miniature paintings during the 11th and 12th centuries. This new style figured first in the form of illustrations etched on palm-leaf manuscripts. The contents of these manuscripts included literature on Buddhism and Jainism. In eastern India, the principal centres of artistic and intellectual activities of the Buddhist religion were Nalanda, Odantapuri, Vikramshila and Somarpura situated in the Pala kingdom (Bengal and Bihar).\n\nEarly survivals of portable Indian paintings are all miniatures from texts (the great majority) or painted objects such as boxes. Despite considerable evidence that larger paintings on cloth (known as \"pata\") existed, and indeed surviving texts discussing how to make them, not a single medieval Indian painting on cloth is known to survive, unless some Buddhist ones have been taken as Tibetan, or from Central Asia. Some of the images recovered by Sir Aurel Stein show Hindu deities (most are Buddhist).\n\nIn eastern India miniature painting survives from the 10th century. These miniatures, depicting Buddhist divinities and scenes from the life of Buddha were painted on the leaves (about 2.25 by 3 inches) of the palm-leaf manuscripts as well as their wooden covers. Most common Buddhist illustrated manuscripts include the texts \"Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita\", \"Pancharaksa\", \"Karandavyuha\" and \"Kalachakra Tantra\". The earliest extant miniatures are found in a manuscript of the \"Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita\" dated in the sixth regnal year of Mahipala (c. 993), presently the possession of The Asiatic Society, Kolkata. This style disappeared from India in the late 12th century.\n\nThe influence of eastern Indian paintings can be seen in various Buddhist temples in Bagan, Myanmar particularly Abeyadana temple which was named after Queen consort of Myanmar, Abeyadana who herself had Indian roots and Gubyaukgyi Temple. The influences of eastern Indian paintings can also be clearly observed in Tibetan Thangka paintings.\n\nSurviving illustrated manuscripts from Western India, mainly Gujarat, begin around the 11th century, but are mostly from the 13th onwards. Initially surviving examples are all Jain. By the 15th-century they were becoming increasingly lavish, with much use of gold.\n\nThe manuscript text most frequently illustrated is the \"Kalpa Sūtra\", containing the biographies of the Tirthankaras, notably Parshvanatha and Mahavira. The illustrations are square-ish panels set in the text, with \"wiry drawing\" and \"brilliant, even jewel-like colour\". The figures are always seen in three-quarters view, with distinctive \"long pointed noses and protruding eyes\". There is a convention whereby the more distant side of the face protrudes, so that both eyes are seen.\n\nAncient texts defined six important aspects of painting. These 'Six Limbs' have been translated as follows:\n\n\nThe subsequent development of painting by the Buddhists indicates that these ' Six Limbs ' were put into practice by Indian artists, and are the basic principles on which their art was founded.\n\nMughal painting is a style of Indian painting, generally confined to illustrations on the book and done in miniatures, and which emerged, developed and took shape during the period of the Mughal Empire between the 16th and 19th centuries. The Mughal style was heavily influenced by Persian miniatures, and in turn influenced several Indian styles, including the Rajput, Pahari and Deccan styles of painting.\n\nMughal paintings were a unique blend of Indian, Persian and Islamic styles. Because the Mughal kings wanted visual records of their deeds as hunters and conquerors, their artists accompanied them on military expeditions or missions of state, or recorded their prowess as animal slayers, or depicted them in the great dynastic ceremonies of marriages.\n\nAkbar's reign (1556–1605) ushered a new era in Indian miniature painting. After he had consolidated his political power, he built a new capital at Fatehpur Sikri where he collected artists from India and Persia. He was the first monarch who established in India an atelier under the supervision of two Persian master artists, Mir Sayyed Ali and Abdus Samad. Earlier, both of them had served under the patronage of Humayun in Kabul and accompanied him to India when he regained his throne in 1555. More than a hundred painters were employed, most of whom were from Gujarat, Gwalior and Kashmir, who gave a birth to a new school of painting, popularly known as the Mughal School of miniature Paintings.\n\nOne of the first productions of that school of miniature painting was the Hamzanama series, which according to the court historian, Badayuni, was started in 1567 and completed in 1582. The Hamzanama, stories of Amir Hamza, an uncle of the Prophet, were illustrated by Mir Sayyid Ali. The paintings of the Hamzanama are of large size, 20 x 27\" and were painted on cloth. They are in the Persian safavi style. Brilliant red, blue and green colours predominate; the pink, eroded rocks and the vegetation, planes and blossoming plum and peach trees are reminiscent of Persia. However, Indian tones appear in later work, when Indian artists were employed.\n\nAfter him, Jahangir encouraged artists to paint portraits and durbar scenes. His most talented portrait painters were Ustad Mansur, Abul Hasan and Bishandas.\n\nShah Jahan (1627–1658) continued the patronage of painting. Some of the famous artists of the period were Mohammad Faqirullah Khan, Mir Hashim, Muhammad Nadir, Bichitr, Chitarman, Anupchhatar, Manohar and Honhar.\n\nAurangzeb had no taste for fine arts, probably due to his Islamic conservatism. Due to lack of patronage artists migrated to the Deccan and the Hindu courts of Rajputana, greatly influencing the styles in these centres.\n\nDeccan painting was produced in the Deccan region of Central India, in the various Muslim capitals of the Deccan sultanates that emerged from the break-up of the Bahmani Sultanate by 1520. These were Bijapur, Golkonda, Ahmadnagar, Bidar, and Berar. The main period was between the late 16th century and the mid-17th, with something of a revival in the mid-18th century, by then centred on Hyderabad.\n\nCompared to the early Mughal painting evolving at the same time to the north, Deccan painting exceeds in \"the brilliance of their colour, the sophistication and artistry of their composition, and a general air of decadent luxury\". Other differences include painting faces, not very expertly modelled, in three-quarter view, rather than mostly in profile in the Mughal style, and \"tall women with small heads\" wearing saris. There are many royal portraits, although they lack the precise likenesses of their Mughal equivalents. Buildings are depicted as \"totally flat screen-like panels\".\n\nRagamala paintings, sets illustrating (by evoking their moods) the various \"raga\" musical forms, appear to have been an innovation of the Deccan. Beside the usual portraits and illustrations to literary works, there are sometimes illustrated chronicles, such as the \"Tuzuk-i-Asafiya\". A Deccan speciality (also sometimes found in other media, such as ivory) is the \"composite animal\" a large animal made up of many smaller images of other animals.\n\nSeveral different styles of Rajput painting developed from the late 16th century onwards in the Hindu royal courts of Rajputana. Each Rajput kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, and humans. Many miniatures were individual album pieces, but there are also illustrated books, and there was at the same time some mural painting on the walls of palaces, forts, and havelis. This especially so in the Shekhawati region, where Marwari businessmen, mainly active in the large cities, competed to have brightly painted exteriors of the houses they maintained in their home region.\n\nRajput painting consists of four principal groupings:\n\nPahari painting is the northernmost extension of the Rajput style, but usually treated separately.\n\nThe Pahari style developed and flourished during 17th to 19th centuries stretching from Jammu to Almora and Garhwal, in the sub-Himalayan India, through Himachal Pradesh. The Pahari paintings can be grouped into two groups- Jammu or Dogra school; and Basholi and Kangra school. Each created stark variations within the genre, ranging from bold intense Basohli Painting, originating from Basohli in Jammu and Kashmir, to the delicate and lyrical Kangra paintings, which became synonymous to the style before other schools of paintings developed.\n\nA new trend in manuscript illustration was set by a manuscript of the \"Nimatnama\" painted at Mandu, during the reign of Nasir Shah (1500–1510). This represent a synthesis of the indigenous and the patronized Persian style, though it was the latter which dominated the Mandu manuscripts. There was another style of painting known as Lodi Khuladar that flourished in the Sultanate's dominion of North India extending from Delhi to Jaunpur.\n\nMysore painting is an important form of classical South Indian painting that originated in the town of Mysore in Karnataka. These paintings are known for their elegance, muted colours and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are Hindu Gods and Goddesses and scenes from Hindu mythology. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought-after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.\n\nThe process of making a Mysore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of cartridge paper pasted on a wooden base. A paste made of zinc oxide and arabic gum is made called \"gesso paste\". With the help of a thin brush all the jewellery and parts of throne or the arch which have some relief are painted over to give a slightly raised effect of carving. This is allowed to dry. On this thin gold foil is pasted. The rest of the drawing is then painted using watercolours. Only muted colours are used.\n\nTanjore painting is an important form of classical South Indian painting native to the town of Tanjore in Tamil Nadu. The art form dates back to the early 9th century, a period dominated by the Chola rulers, who encouraged art and literature. These paintings are known for their elegance, rich colours, and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are Hindu Gods and Goddesses and scenes from Hindu mythology. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought-after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.\n\nThe process of making a Tanjore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of a cloth pasted over a wooden base. Then chalk powder or zinc oxide is mixed with water-soluble adhesive and apply it on the base. To make the base smoother, a mild abrasive is sometimes used. After the drawing is made, decoration of the jewelry and the apparels in the image is done with semi-precious stones. Laces or threads are also used to decorate the jewelry. On top of this, the gold foils are pasted. Finally, dyes are used to add colours to the figures in the paintings.\n\nPattachitra refers to the Classical painting of Odisha and West Bengal, in the eastern region of India.'Patta' in Sanskrit means 'Vastra' or 'clothings' and 'chitra' means paintings.\nThe Bengal Patachitra refers to the painting of West Bengal. It is a traditional and mythological heritage of West Bengal. The Bengal Patachitra is divided into some different aspects like Durga Pat, \"Chalchitra\", \"Tribal Patachitra\", \"Medinipur Patachitra\", Kalighat Patachitra etc. The subject matter of Bengal Patachitra is mostly mythological, religious stories, folk lore and social. The Kalighat Patachitra, the last tradition of Bengal Patachitra is developed by Jamini Roy. The artist of the Bengal Patachitra is called Patua.\nThe tradition of Orisha Pattachitra is closely linked with the worship of Lord Jagannath. Apart from the fragmentary evidence of paintings on the caves of Khandagiri and Udayagiri and Sitabhinji murals of the Sixth century A.D., the earliest indigenous paintings from Odisha are the Pattachitra done by the Chitrakars (the painters are called Chitrakars). The theme of Oriya painting centres round the Vaishnava sect. Since beginning of Pattachitra culture Lord Jagannath who was an incarnation of Lord Krishna was the major source of inspiration. The subject matter of Patta Chitra is mostly mythological, religious stories and folk lore. Themes are chiefly on Lord Jagannath and Radha-Krishna, different \"Vesas\" of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra, temple activities, the ten incarnations of Vishnu basing on the 'Gita Govinda' of Jayadev, Kama Kujara Naba Gunjara, Ramayana, Mahabharata. The individual paintings of gods and goddesses are also being painted.The painters use vegetable and mineral colours without going for factory made poster colours. They prepare their own colours. White colour is made from the conch-shells by powdering, boiling and filtering in a very hazardous process. It requires a lot of patience. But this process gives brilliance and premanence to the hue. 'Hingula', a mineral colour, is used for red. 'Haritala', king of stone ingredients for yellow, 'Ramaraja' a sort of indigo for blue are being used. Pure lamp-black or black prepared from the burning of cocoanut shells are used.The brushes that are used by these 'Chitrakaras' are also indigenous and are made of hair of domestic animals. A bunch of hair tied to the end of a bamboo stick make the brush. It is really a matter of wonder as to how these painters bring out lines of such precision and finish with the help of these crude brushes. That old tradition of Oriya painting still survives to-day in the skilled hands of Chitrakaras (traditional painters) in Puri, Raghurajpur, Paralakhemundi, Chikiti and Sonepur.\n\nMadhubani painting is a style of painting, practiced in the Mithila region of Bihar state. Themes revolve around Hindu Gods and mythology, along with scenes from the royal court and social events like weddings. Generally no space is left empty; the gaps are filled by paintings of flowers, animals, birds, and even geometric designs.In this paintings, artists use leaves, herbs, and flowers to make the colour which is used to draw the paintings.\n\nAs Company rule in India began in the 18th century, a great number of Europeans migrated to India. The Company style is a term for a hybrid Indo-European style of paintings made in India by Indian and European artists, many of whom worked for European patrons in the British East India Company or other foreign Companies in the 18th and 19th centuries. The style blended traditional elements from Rajput and Mughal painting with a more Western treatment of perspective, volume and recession.\n\nAt the start of the 18th century, oil and easel painting began in India, which saw many European artists, such as Zoffany, Kettle, Hodges, Thomas and William Daniell, Joshua Reynolds, Emily Eden and George Chinnery coming out to India in search of fame and fortune. The courts of the princely states of India were an important draw for European artists due to their patronage of the visual and performing arts. For Indian artists, this Western influence, largely a result of colonialism, was viewed as “a means for self-improvement,” and these Western academic artists who visited India provided the model. They did not, however, provide the training. According to R. Siva Kumar, “This task, which fell on the various art schools established in the 1850s, gave an institutional framework to the Westernization of Indian art.”\n\nThe earliest formal art schools in India, namely the Government College of Fine Arts in Madras (1850), Government College of Art & Craft in Calcutta (1854) and Sir J. J. School of Art in Bombay (1857), were established.\n\nRaja Ravi Varma was a pioneer of modern Indian painting. He drew on Western traditions and techniques including oil paint and easel painting, with his subjects being purely Indian, such as Hindu deities and episodes from the epics and Puranas. Some other prominent Indian painters born in the 19th century are Mahadev Vishwanath Dhurandhar (1867–1944), A X Trindade (1870–1935), M F Pithawalla (1872–1937), Sawlaram Lakshman Haldankar (1882–1968) and Hemen Majumdar (1894–1948).\n\nIn the 19th century, according to R. Siva Kumar, “selective Westernization for self-improvement gave way to a nationalist cultural counter-stance around the turn of the century -- universally, the first step toward a political resistance toward colonial rule.” In practice, this materialized as an assimilation of “diverse Asian elements,” expanding tradition more than reviving it. Leading artist of the time, Abanindranath Tagore (1871-1951), utilized both the Western-influenced realism and Asian elements which brought him “close to early modernism.”\n\nA reaction to the Western influence led to a revival in historic and more nationalistic Indian art, called as the Bengal school of art, which drew from the rich cultural heritage of India.\n\nThe Bengal School of Art was an influential style of art that flourished in India during the British Raj in the early 20th century. It was associated with Indian nationalism, but was also promoted and supported by many British arts administrators.\n\nThe Bengal school arose as an avant garde and nationalist movement reacting against the academic art styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as Ravi Varma and in British art schools. Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher Ernest Binfield Havel attempted to reform the teaching methods at the Calcutta School of Art by encouraging students to imitate Mughal miniatures. This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havel was supported by the artist Abanindranath Tagore, a nephew of the poet and artist Rabindranath Tagore. Abanindranath painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the \"materialism\" of the West. His best-known painting, \"Bharat Mata\" (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations.\n\nTagore later attempted to develop links with Far-Eastern artists as part of an aspiration to construct a pan-Asianist model of art. Those associated with this Indo-Far Eastern model included Nandalal Bose, Mukul Dey, Kalipada Ghoshal, Benode Behari Mukherjee, Vinayak Shivaram Masoji, B.C. Sanyal, Beohar Rammanohar Sinha, and subsequently their students A. Ramachandran, Tan Yuan Chameli, Ramananda Bandopadhyay and a few others.\n\nThe Bengal school's influence on Indian art scene gradually started alleviating with the spread of modernist ideas post-independence.K. G. Subramanyan's role in this movement is significant.\n\nThe term Contextual Modernism that Siva Kumar used in the catalogue of the exhibition has emerged as a postcolonial critical tool in the understanding of the art the Santiniketan artists had practised.\n\nSeveral terms including Paul Gilroy's \"counter culture of modernity\" and Tani Barlow's \"Colonial modernity\" have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that ‘Contextual Modernism’ is a more suited term because “the colonial in \"colonial modernity\" does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonised situations to internalise inferiority. Santiniketan’s artist teachers’ refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterised imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.”\n\nAccording to R. Siva Kumar \"The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism.\" He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming Nandalal Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Ram Kinker Baij and Benode Behari Mukherjee under the Bengal School of Art was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. \"This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice\".\n\nThe literary critic Ranjit Hoskote while reviewing the works of contemporary artist Atul Dodiya writes, \"The exposure to Santinketan, through a literary detour, opened Dodiya’s eyes to the historical circumstances of what the art historian R Siva Kumar has called a “contextual modernism” developed in eastern India in the 1930s and ’40s during the turbulent decades of the global Depression, the Gandhian liberation struggle, the Tagorean cultural renaissance and World War II.\"\n\n\"Contextual Modernism\" in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in Architecture.\n\nDuring the colonial era, Western influences started to make an impact on Indian art. Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes. Others, like Jamini Roy, consciously drew inspiration from folk art. Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional Mithila Painting in most contemporary way and uses both realism as well abstractionism in her work with a lot of fantasy mixed in to both .Her work has an impeccable sense of balance, harmony and grace.\n\nBy the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.\n\nThe Progressive Artists' Group, established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. The founders were six eminent artists – K. H. Ara, S. K. Bakre, H. A. Gade, M.F. Husain, S.H. Raza and F. N. Souza, though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, Manishi Dey, V. S. Gaitonde, Krishen Khanna, Ram Kumar, Tyeb Mehta, Beohar Rammanohar Sinha and Akbar Padamsee. Other famous painters like Jahar Dasgupta, Prokash Karmakar, John Wilkins, and Bijon Choudhuri enriched the art culture of India. They have become the icon of modern Indian art. Art historians like Prof. Rai Anand Krishna have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos.\n\nAlso, the increase in the discourse about Indian art, in English as well as vernacular Indian languages, appropriated the way art was perceived in the art schools. Critical approach became rigorous, critics like Geeta Kapur, R . Siva Kumar, contributed to re-thinking contemporary art practice in India.Their voices represented Indian art not only in India but across the world. The critics also had an important role as curators of important exhibitions, re-defining modernism and Indian-art.\n\nIndian Art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since the early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. Post-liberalization Indian art thus works not only within the confines of academic traditions but also outside it. In this phase, artists have introduced even newer concepts which have hitherto not been seen in Indian art. Devajyoti Ray has introduced a new genre of art called Pseudorealism. Pseudorealist Art is an original art style that has been developed entirely on the Indian soil. Pseudorealism takes into account the Indian concept of abstraction and uses it to transform regular scenes of Indian life into a fantastic images.\n\nVernacular art is an art alive (contemporary art), based on the past (the myths, the traditions and the religion) and made by defined groups. Vernacular art is based on the collective memory of this group.\n\nExamples of Vernacular Indian Painting:\n\nTribal Painting:\n\nRural Painting: \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There are several types which use different operating mechanisms. They use different motions to generate the required power; such as squeezing a handle, winding a crank, or shaking the flashlight itself. These flashlights can also be distinguished by the technique used to store the energy: a spring, a flywheel, a battery or a capacitor.\n\nSince they are always ready for use, mechanically powered flashlights are often kept as emergency lights in case of power outages or other emergencies. They are also kept at vacation homes, cabins, and other remote locations because they are not limited by battery shelf life like ordinary flashlights. They are considered a green technology, because the disposable batteries used by ordinary flashlights are wasteful in terms of resources used for the amount of energy produced, and also contain heavy metals and toxic chemicals which end up in the environment.\n\nA dyno torch, dynamo torch, or squeeze flashlight is a flashlight or pocket torch which generates energy via a flywheel. The user repeatedly squeezes a handle to spin a flywheel inside the flashlight, attached to a small generator/dynamo, supplying electric current to an incandescent bulb or light-emitting diode. The flashlight must be pumped continuously during use, with the flywheel turning the generator between squeezes to keep the light going continuously. Because electrical power is produced only when the handle is squeezed, a switch is not needed. Dyno lights were issued to German Wehrmacht soldiers during World War II, and were popular in Europe during the war because the electrical power supply to homes was not very reliable. In addition to \"squeeze flashlight\", American soldiers often referred to such lights as \"squeezy flashlight\" or even \"squeegee flashlight\".\n\nA version using a pull-cord was used in World War I.\n\nThe photo shows the internal mechanism: the L-shaped handle has a gear rack, which spins the white step-up gear, which in turn spins the flywheel on which is mounted both a centrifugal clutch (to allow freewheeling after the lever stops its travel and then returns) and a dark grey magnet, seen on the lower left. The magnet induces an electric current as it spins around the red copper winding, seen on the lower right. The current from the copper winding flows through the filament of an incandescent light bulb (not shown), giving off light. An L-shaped spring returns the handle to its original position after each engagement.\n\nThe linear induction, Faraday flashlight, or \"shake flashlight\" is another type of mechanically powered flashlight. It has been sold in the US beginning with direct marketing campaigns in 2002. \n\nThis design contains a linear electrical generator which charges a supercapacitor which functions similarly to a rechargeable battery when the flashlight is shaken lengthwise. The battery or capacitor powers a white LED lamp. The linear generator consists of a sliding rare earth magnet which moves back and forth through the center of a solenoid (a coil of copper wire) when it is shaken. A current is induced in the loops of wire by Faraday's law of induction each time the magnet slides through, which charges the capacitor through a rectifier and other circuitry.\n\nThe best designs use a supercapacitor instead of a rechargeable battery, since these have a longer working life than a battery. This, along with the long-life light emitting diode which does not burn out like an incandescent bulb, give the flashlight a long lifetime, making it a useful emergency light. A disadvantage of many current models is that the supercapacitor cannot store much energy in comparison to a lithium-ion cell, limiting the operating time per charge. In most designs, vigorously shaking the light for about 30 seconds may provide up to 5 minutes of light, though the advertised time omits the reduced output of the LED after 2 or 3 minutes. Shaking the unit for 10 to 15 seconds every 2 or 3 minutes as necessary permits the device to be used continuously. It is often viewed as a toy, or an emergency backup for other flashlights.\n\nFraudulent counterfeit versions of these flashlights have been sold, most of which incorporate coin-sized non-rechargeable lithium cells \"hidden in plain sight\". The expensive supercapacitor is omitted from the internal components. In some of these fake designs, the \"magnet\" is not a magnet or the coil is not connected, and no electricity is generated when the device is shaken. These fraudulent flashlights eventually become useless, since their internal batteries cannot be recharged or replaced, and the case is often permanently glued shut.\n\nAnother common type is the windup or crank-powered flashlight, with the light powered by a battery which is recharged by a generator turned by a hand crank on the flashlight. One minute of cranking typically provides about 30 to 60 minutes of light. It has the advantage that it doesn't have to be pumped continually during use like the dyno torch or some shake flashlights. However it may be less reliable as an emergency light, because the rechargeable battery it contains eventually wears out. The lithium-ion cells used are typically rated for around 500 charges.\n\nIn an alternative \"Clockwork Torch\" design, produced by Freeplay Energy, the energy is mechanically stored in a flat spiral wound mainspring, rather than a battery. The owner winds the spring up by turning the crank. Then when the light is turned on, the spring unwinds, turning a generator to provide power to run the light. The purpose of this design, originally invented for use in the developing world, was to improve its reliability and useful lifetime, by avoiding or reducing reliance on a battery. , the original design is no longer made, but updated smaller hand-cranked models using LEDs are available.\n\nSome mechanically powered flashlights include additional functions and features beyond just a source of light. Models sold as emergency lights have additional functions useful in emergencies, such as flashing red or yellow lights for roadside emergencies, sirens, and AM/FM, weather or shortwave radios. They may also include alternative means of charging the battery, such as an AC adaptor, solar cells, or cords that plug into a car cigarette lighter socket.\n\nCrank powered flashlights often have radios and other features. One popular feature is a 5-volt USB charging port for recharging cell phones when an outlet is not available. The quality and long-term reliability of these devices vary over a wide range, from high-reliability mil-spec emergency equipment down to one-time-use non-repairable disposables\n\nThe first mechanically powered portable illumination was the \"steel mill\", used in coal mining during the 1800s. These lamps consisted of a steel disk, rotated at high speed by a crank mechanism. Pressing a flint against the disk produced a shower of sparks and dim illumination. These mills were only used in coal mines, where a risk of explosive firedamp gas made candle lighting unsafe. Caution was required to observe the sparks, so as not to generate very hot sparks that could ignite firedamp. These mills were troublesome to use and were often worked by a boy, whose only task was to provide light for a group of miners. One of the first of these mills was the 18th century Spedding mill, the Spedding family having a long association as the agents for the Lowther family of Westmorland and the Whitehaven collieries.\n\nSteel mills went out of favor after the introduction of the much brighter and simpler Davy and Geordie lamps from 1815. The mill idea was revived in 1946, based on the developed technology of cigarette lighters and ferrocerium flints. A spring-wound lamp with eight flints was suggested for emergency signalling at sea.\n\n"}
{"id": "2174253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174253", "title": "Jeff Fisher", "text": "Jeff Fisher\n\nJeffrey Michael \"Jeff\" Fisher (born February 25, 1958) is a former American football coach and player. He served as a head coach in the National Football League (NFL) for 22 seasons, primarily with the Houston / Tennessee Oilers / Titans franchise. He coached the Titans for 17 seasons and the St. Louis / Los Angeles Rams for five seasons.\n\nFisher became the coach of the Titans towards the end of the 1994 season during their tenure as the Houston Oilers and was the team's first coach when they relocated to Tennessee. He continued to coach the Titans until after the end of the 2010 season when the Titans and Fisher mutually agreed to part ways. Following a season away from football, Fisher was hired as the head coach of the Rams in 2012 and coached the team during their last four years in St. Louis. He remained the head coach of the Rams during the franchise's return to Los Angeles in 2016, but was fired near the end of the season.\n\nFisher's most successful season was in 1999, when he led the Titans to the franchise's first (and only) Super Bowl appearance in XXXIV, which ended in close defeat by the St. Louis Rams for their first Super Bowl title. However, despite compiling a winning record as a head coach, Fisher's career has been noted for an overall lack of success, having only obtained six winning seasons and postseason appearances in over two decades in the NFL. He holds the record for the most regular-season losses by an NFL head coach at 165, tied with Dan Reeves.\n\nA native of Southern California, Fisher starred as a high school All-American wide receiver at Taft High School in Woodland Hills.\n\nFisher went on to star at USC, under coach John Robinson. During his collegiate career (1977–80), he played alongside such defensive stars as Ronnie Lott, Dennis Smith, and Joey Browner. Fisher's USC teammates also included star offensive lineman Bruce Matthews, whom he would coach years later with the Oilers and Titans. Fisher and the Trojans won a national championship during the 1978 season, and in 1980 he was honored as a Pac-10 All-Academic selection.\n\nFisher was drafted in the seventh round of the 1981 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears. He appeared in 49 games as a defensive back and return specialist in his five seasons with the Bears.\n\nFisher had a key performance in the Chicago Bears Week 14 contest against the Minnesota Vikings. With the 7-6 Vikings fighting for the NFC Central title, the Bears entered the game at 3-10. In the 4th quarter, Fisher made a leaping interception at the line of scrimmage and then clinched Chicago's win by recovering a free kick after an intentional safety by the Bears, sealing a 10-9 win.\n\nIn 1983, Fisher had suffered a broken leg on a punt return when he was tackled by then-Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Bill Cowher. Coincidentally the two became rivals as head coaches beginning in the AFC Central in 1995; Fisher's Oilers/Titans squads came out with an 11–7 record against Cowher's Pittsburgh Steelers. In 1984, he set a Bears franchise record with eight punt returns in a single game against Detroit, helping him tie with Lew Barnes' club record of 57 returns in a single season. Fisher earned a Super Bowl ring after Chicago's 1985 Super Bowl season, despite spending the year on injured reserve with an ankle injury that prematurely ended his playing career. Fisher stayed with the Bears as a defensive assistant while on injured reserve for the season.\n\nDuring 1985, Fisher used his time on the Bears' injured reserve to assist defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan. After the Bears won the Super Bowl that season, Ryan was hired as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles and Fisher joined as a defensive backs coach. In 1988, Fisher was promoted to defensive coordinator at age 30, the youngest such coach in the league. The 1989 Eagles defense led the NFL in interceptions (30) and sacks (62). The 1990 squad led the league in rushing defense and finished second in sacks.\n\nIn 1991, Fisher was hired as defensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Rams, which reunited him with his college coach John Robinson. The next two seasons, he served as the defensive backs coach for the San Francisco 49ers. These years as an assistant to George Seifert placed Fisher in the Bill Walsh coaching tree. On February 9, 1994, Fisher again became a defensive coordinator, this time for the Houston Oilers under Jack Pardee. Fisher had succeeded Ryan, who left the post to become the head coach of the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nOn November 14, 1994, Pardee was fired, and Fisher was promoted to replace him for the last six games of the season. The Oilers retained Fisher as head coach, and the Oilers drafted quarterback Steve McNair in the 1995 NFL Draft. The new coach did not disappoint, leading the team to a 7–9 record in 1995, tied for second place in the division. The following year, the Oilers added Heisman Trophy winner Eddie George, and they achieved an 8–8 record. However, an inability to get a new stadium deal in Houston caused owner Bud Adams to relocate the team to Tennessee for the 1997 season.\n\nIn the team's first two seasons in Tennessee the Oilers compiled a record of 16–16. In 1998, the team's home games moved from Memphis to Nashville.\n\nIn the 1999 season, the newly renamed Tennessee Titans finished with a 13–3 regular season record, going all the way to Super Bowl XXXIV, in part due to the Music City Miracle. The Titans fell to the St. Louis Rams, 23–16; wideout Kevin Dyson was tackled one yard short of the end zone with no time remaining, in what became known as \"The Tackle\". Tennessee achieved the same record the next year, but were defeated in the AFC playoffs by the Baltimore Ravens who would go on to win Super Bowl XXXV.\n\nThe 2001 season was a disappointing one for the Titans, as they could only muster a 7–9 showing. The beginning of the next season proved to be even worse, with the franchise starting off with a 1–4 record. Following one home loss, owner Bud Adams made the comment to reporters that perhaps the Titans \"were getting outcoached.\" This provided a spark the team needed, and they finished the season with an 11–5 record and made it to the AFC Championship Game.\n\nThe 2003 season saw more success, with yet another trip to the playoffs and McNair tying for the League MVP award (with Peyton Manning). Again, they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the New England Patriots, but the team's progress did not go unnoticed. The 2004 season, however, was plagued by injuries from the start, and they finished at 5–11. Following the season, many veteran players (such as Samari Rolle and Derrick Mason) were cut in an effort to comply with the strict salary cap. The relative youth of the team resulted in a disappointing 2005 season as well. Before the 2005 season, Fisher hired Norm Chow out of USC to be his offensive coordinator.\n\nIn 2006, the Titans finished a better-than-expected 8–8. Quarterback Steve McNair was traded to the Baltimore Ravens and Vince Young was drafted, but began the season as backup to Billy Volek and Kerry Collins. The season began slowly at 0–3 before Volek was replaced by Kerry Collins and, later, Young. The team ultimately started 2–7, but following a 27–26 loss to the Baltimore Ravens and McNair, the Titans erupted to win six straight games under Young, including a 24-point rally to beat the New York Giants. With this promising record the Titans exercised their right to extend his contract by a year, keeping him as the head coach through the 2007 NFL season.\n\nIn 2007, he led the Titans to a 10–6 record and made the AFC playoffs as the 6th seed, but lost in the opening round to the San Diego Chargers.\n\nIn 2008, Fisher led the Titans to a 10–0 undefeated streak only to be upset by Brett Favre and the New York Jets midway through the 2008 season. The Titans finished 13–3 and secured the number 1 seed in the AFC, yet lost in the second round of the 2008 NFL Playoffs to the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nIn 2009 the Titans lost in overtime to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the season's opening game. The loss began a six-game slide that reached its nadir in a 59–0 slaughter by the New England Patriots. Collins, at the public recommendation of Titans owner Bud Adams, was benched and replaced by Young; the Titans responded by winning eight of their next ten games, highlighted by a dramatic comeback victory over the Arizona Cardinals, a season-ending comeback against the Seattle Seahawks, and a hard-fought overtime win over the Miami Dolphins. Highlighting this season was the play of running back Chris Johnson; in his second year of professional football (he'd been drafted 24th in the 2008 NFL Draft) Johnson broke Marshall Faulk's record of total yards from scrimmage with 2,509, becoming the sixth back in NFL history to rush over 2,000 yards.\n\nIn 2010, relations between Fisher and Vince Young became increasingly strained. In a home game against the Washington Redskins, Young was removed following an injury to his thumb and subsequently not allowed to re-enter the game. In disgust, he began removing his equipment while still on the sidelines, eventually throwing his shoulder pads into the stands. He walked off of the field as the contest continued. Young never appeared in another game for the Titans and was released at the end of the season.\n\nInitially it appeared that Fisher's tenure with the Titans would survive this situation; however, on January 27, 2011, almost four weeks after the end of the 2010 regular season, it was formally announced that Fisher and the Titans had mutually agreed to part ways following a buyout of the one remaining season on Fisher's contract. At more than 16 full seasons, Fisher had been the longest-tenured NFL head coach with one team among active head coaches.\n\nAfter a season off in 2011, Fisher agreed to become the head coach of the St. Louis Rams on January 13, 2012.\n\nIn Fisher's first season in St. Louis, the team finished with a 7–8–1 record, a five–win improvement from the previous year.\n\nIn 2013, the Rams finished with a 7–9 record.\nDuring the 2014 season, the Rams went 6–10. It was the team's worst record under Fisher, and also Fisher's 4th consecutive losing season as a head coach. In the team's final season in St. Louis in 2015 they finished with a 7–9 record.\n\nThe Rams started the 2016 season 3–1 but lost 6 of their next 7 games leading up to the Rams' announcement, on December 4, that they had signed him to a two-year contract extension through 2018; however, just over a week later, on December 12, the Rams fired Fisher following a 42–14 loss to the eventual NFC champion Atlanta Falcons in which they were held scoreless until scoring 2 meaningless touchdowns in the 4th quarter. This loss helped him tie the record for the most regular season losses of any NFL Coach of all time.\n\nFisher was co-chair of the NFL competition committee along with Atlanta Falcons President Rich McKay until his resignation in August 2016.\n\nFisher has three kids. One son, Brandon, played linebacker for the University of Montana and was a defensive backs coach for the Rams on his father’s staff. Another son, Trent, was a defensive back at Auburn University.\n\n\n"}

It is similar to regulatory systems in France (AOC), Spain (DO), Italy (DOC), and Germany (QmP). The VQA system allows for sub-appellations, by which the grapes for wines are sourced from extremely specific geographical locations with different soil and climate. This is in accordance with the concept of \"terroir\".\n\nIn addition, there are other classifications of wine in Canada. British Columbia has a category known as \"\"Wines of Distinction\"\", Nova Scotia has \"\"Wines of Nova Scotia\"\" and Quebec has \"\"Vins du Québec\"\". Both must be 100 percent made from grapes grown in British Columbia, Nova Scotia or Quebec. Cellared in Canada is a completely separate category.\n\nIn addition to the requirements regarding sources of grapes, VQA wines may be made from \"Vitis vinifera\" grape variety and approved hybrid varieties. In British Columbia, VQA wines are made primarily with \"vinifera\" grapes, while Ontario uses a range of vinifera varieties and notably permits the use of Vidal, particularly in the production of some of Canada's icewines.\n\nVQA wines may be made with grapes from relatively small agricultural yields per vine (which increases quality), they meet specific sugar or brix levels at harvest, and the use of additives is regulated. There are also standards regulating the use of certain types of packaging and closures. To receive the VQA designation, wine must undergo testing by the regulating bodies. The VQA logo does not have a standard location on the bottle, and for some VQA wines the producer has chosen not to display the logo at all.

It is one of the many languages (often called dialects) of a complex called Prakrit, and the chief Dramatic Prakrit. Maharashtri was spoken for 1000 years (500 BCE to 500 CE). It was used in numerous works of literature, and its literary use was made famous by the Sanskrit playwright Kālidāsa.\n\nMaharashtri Prakrit was commonly spoken until 875 CE and was the official language of the Satavahana dynasty. Works like \"Karpurmanjari\" and \"Saptashati\" (150BCE) were written in it. Maharashtri Prakrit was the most widely used Prakrit language in western and southern India.\n\nMaharashtri Apabhraṃśas remained in use until the 13th century, and were widely used in Jain literature, forming an important link in the evolution of the language.\n\nThe rise of the Prakrits is dated to the middle of the second millennium BCE when they existed alongside Vedic Sanskrit and later evolved into highly developed literary languages. It is a subject of scholarly debate as to whether Sanskrit or the Prakrits are older with some scholars contending that Sanskrit was born out of the Prakrits. According to the Sanskrit scholar, Rajaramshastri Bhagawat, Maharashtri is older and more vivacious than Sanskrit.\n\nVararuchi, the oldest known grammarian of Prakrit, devotes four chapters of his \"Prakrita-Prakasha\" () to the grammar of Maharashtri Prakrit. The other popular Prakrits—Shauraseni, Ardhamagadhi, and Paishachi—merit only one each. This preeminence of Maharashtri is confirmed by Dandin () who, in his Kavyadarsha, grants it the highest status among all Prakrits.\n\nMaharashtri is the most attested amongst all Prakrit languages. It was spoken from Malwa and Rajputana (north) to the Krishna River and Tungabhadra River region (south). Historians agree that Maharashtri and other Prakrit languages prevailed in what is now modern Maharashtra.\nMaharashtri was widely spoken in Western India and even as far south as Kannada-speaking region.\n\nThe \"Gaha Sattasati\" is attributed to King Hāla (r. 20-24 CE). Other Maharashtri Prakrit works include Setubandh , Karpuramañjarī and SriHarivijay. The language was used by Vakpati to write the poem \"Gaüdavaho\". It is also used in the dialogue and songs of low-class characters in Sanskrit plays, especially the famous dramatist Kālidāsa.\n\nMaharashtri was the official language of the Satavahana dynasty in the early centuries of the Common Era. Under the patronage of the Satavahana Empire, Maharashtri became the most widespread Prakrit of its time, and also dominated the literary culture amongst the three \"Dramatic\" Prakrits of the time, Maharashtri, Shauraseni and Magadhi. A version of Maharashtri called \"Jaina Maharashtri\" was also employed to write Jain scripture.\n\n"}

A diversity scheme is typically required when using frequencies in the Ka, V, or W-band. The downlink transmissions of satellites cover very large areas, that will have different weather. The site diversity technique consists of linking two or more ground stations receiving the same signal: this way, if the signal is heavily attenuated in one area, another ground stations can compensate it. These intense rain areas, for example, supercells, often have a horizontal length of no more than a few kilometers: putting the ground stations at a sufficient distance the possibility of rain fade in the downlink signal will be reduced.\n\nThe configuration works when the attenuation is not great at the two stations simultaneously. This is usually a valid assumption. Site diversity systems have been known to minimize disruption of service by major satellite carriers.\n\n"}

They may have once been spoken languages or were based on spoken languages, but continued to be used as literary languages long after they ceased to be spoken. Dramatic Prakrits are important for the study of the development of Indo-Aryan languages, because their usage in plays and literature is always accompanied by a translation in Sanskrit.\n\nThe phrase \"Dramatic Prakrits\" often refers to the three most prominent of them, Shauraseni, Magadhi and Maharashtri Prakrits. However, there were a slew of other less commonly used Prakrits that also fall into this category. These include Prācya, Bahliki, Dakshinatya, Sakari, Candali, Sabari, Abhiri, Dramili, and Odri. There was an astoundingly strict structure to the use of these different Prakrits in dramas. Characters each spoke a different Prakrit based on their role and background; for example, Dramili was the language of \"forest-dwellers\", Shauraseni was spoken by \"the heroine and her female friends\", and Avanti was spoken by \"cheats and rogues\". The prakrits varied in intelligibility with Shauraseni being most similar to classical Sanskrit while Magadhi Prakrit being most similar to classical Pali.\n\nMaharashtri, the root of modern Marathi, is a particularly interesting case. Maharashtri was often used for poetry and as such, diverged from proper Sanskrit grammar mainly to fit the language to the meter of different styles of poetry. The new grammar stuck, which leads to the unique flexibility of vowels lengths, amongst other anomalies, in Marathi.\n\nThe three principal Dramatic Prakrits and some of their descendant languages:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2174304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174304", "title": "Ibn Jubayr", "text": "Ibn Jubayr\n\nIbn Jubayr (1 September 1145 –29 November 1217; ), also written Ibn Jubair, Ibn Jobair, and Ibn Djubayr, was an Arab geographer, traveller and poet from al-Andalus. His travel chronicle describes the pilgrimage he made to Mecca from 1183 to 1185, in the years preceding the Third Crusade. His chronicle describes Saladin's domains in Egypt and the Levant which he passed through on his way to Mecca. Further, on his return journey he passed through Christian Sicily, which had only been recaptured from the Muslims a century before, and he makes several observations on the hybrid polyglot culture which flourished there.\n\nIbn Jubayr was born in 1145 A.D. in Valencia, Spain, to an Arab family of the Kinanah tribe. He was a descendant of 'Abdal-Salam ibn Jabayr who in 740 A.D. had accompanied an army sent by the Caliph of Damascus to put down a Berber uprising in his Spanish provinces. Ibn Jubayr studied in the town of Xàtiva where his father worked as a civil servant. He later became secretary to the Almohad governor of Granada.\n\nIn the introduction to his \"Rihla\" Ibn Jubayr explains the reason for his travels. As secretary for the ruler of Granada in 1182, he was forced, under threat, to drink seven cups of wine. Seized by remorse, the ruler then filled seven cups of gold dinars which he gave him. To expiate his godless act, although forced upon him, Ibn Jubayr decided to perform the duty of Hajj to Mecca. He left Granada on 3 February 1183 accompanied by a physician from the city.\n\nIbn Jubayr left Granada and crossed over the Strait of Gibraltar to Ceuta, then under Muslim rule. He boarded a Genoese ship on February 24, 1183 and set sail for Alexandria. His sea journey took him past the Balearic Islands and then across to the west coast of Sardinia. Whilst offshore he heard of the fate of 80 Muslim men, women and children who had been abducted from North Africa and were being sold into slavery. Between Sardinia and Sicily the ship ran into a severe storm. He said of the Italians and Muslims on board who had experience of the sea that \"all agreed that they had never in their lives seen such a tempest\". After the storm the ship went on past Sicily, Crete and then turned south and crossed over to the North African coast. He arrived in Alexandria on March 26.\n\nEverywhere that Ibn Jubayr travelled in Egypt he was full of praise for the new Sunni ruler, Saladin. For example, he says of him that: \"There is no congregational or ordinary mosque, no mausoleum built over a grave, nor hospital, nor theological college, where the bounty of the Sultan does not extend to all who seek shelter or live in them.\" He points out that when the Nile does not flood enough, Saladin remits the land tax from the farmers. He also says that \"such is his (Salahuddin's) justice, and the safety he has brought to his high-roads that men in his lands can go about their affairs by night and from its darkness apprehend no awe that should deter them.\" Ibn Jubayr is, on the other hand, very disparaging of the previous Shi'a dynasty of the Fatimids.\n\nOf Cairo, Ibn Jubayr notes, are the colleges and hostels erected for students and pious men of other lands by the Sultan Saladin. In those colleges students find lodging and tutors to teach them the sciences they desire, and also allowances to cover their needs. The care of the sultan also grants them baths, hospitals, and the appointment of doctors who can even come to visit them at their place of stay, and who would be answerable for their cure. One of the Sultan Saladin's other generous acts was that every day two thousand loaves of bread were distributed to the poor. Also impressing Ibn Jubayr in that city was the number of mosques, estimated at between 8 and 12 thousand; often four or five of them in the same street.\n\nUpon arrival at Alexandria Ibn Jubayr was angered by the customs officials who insisted on taking zakat from the pilgrims, regardless of whether they were obliged to pay it or not. In the city he visited the Lighthouse of Alexandria, which at that time was still standing, and he was amazed by its size and splendour.\nOne of the greatest wonders that we saw in this city was the lighthouse which Great and Glorious God had erected by the hands of those who were forced to such labor as 'Indeed in that are signs for those who discern'. Quran 15:75 and as a guide to voyagers, for without it they could not find the true course to Alexandria. It can be seen for more than seventy miles, and is of great antiquity. It is most strongly built in all directions and competes with the skies in height. Description of it falls short, the eyes fail to comprehend it, and words are inadequate, so vast is the spectacle.\nHe was also impressed by the free colleges, hostels for foreign students, baths and hospitals in the city. These were paid for by awqaf and taxes on the city's Jews and Christians. He noted that there were between 8,000 and 12,000 mosques in Alexandria. After a stay of eight days he set off for Cairo.\n\nHe reached Cairo three days later. In the city he visited the cemetery at al-Qarafah, which contained the graves of many important figures in the history of Islam. He noted while in the Cairo of Saladin, the walls of the citadel were being extended by the Mamluks with the object of reinforcing the entire city from any future Crusader siege. Another building work that he saw was the construction of a bridge over the Nile, which would be high enough not to be submerged in the annual flooding of the river. He saw a spacious free hospital which was divided into three sections: one each for men, women and the insane. He saw the pyramids, although he was unaware of who they had been built for, and the Sphinx. He also saw a device that was used for measuring the height of the Nile flood.\n\nIn Sicily, at the very late stages of his travels (Dec 1184-Jan 1185), Ibn Jubayr recounts other experiences. He comments on the activity of the volcanoes:\nAt the close of night a red flame appeared, throwing up tongues into the air. It was the celebrated volcano (Stromboli). We were told that a fiery blast of great violence bursts out from air-holes in the two mountains and makes the fire. Often a great stone is cast up and thrown into the air by the force of the blast and prevented thereby from falling and settling at the bottom. This is one of the most remarkable of stories, and it is true.\n\nAs for the great mountain in the island, known as the Jabal al-Nar [Mountain of Fire], it also presents a singular feature in that some years a fire pours from it in the manner of the `bursting of the dam'. It passes nothing it does not burn until, coming to the sea, it rides out on its surface and then subsides beneath it. Let us praise the Author of all things for His marvelous creations. There is no God but He.\n\nAlso striking Ibn Jubayr is the city of Palermo. He describes it as follows:\nIt is the metropolis of these islands, combining the benefits of wealth and splendour, and having all that you could wish of beauty, real or apparent, and all the needs of subsistence, mature and fresh. It is an ancient and elegant city, magnificent and gracious, and seductive to look upon. Proudly set between its open spaces and plains filled with gardens, with broad roads and avenues, it dazzles the eyes with its perfection. It is a wonderful place, built in the Cordova style, entirely from cut stone known as kadhan [a soft limestone]. A river splits the town, and four springs gush in its suburbs... The King roams through the gardens and courts for amusement and pleasure... The Christian women of this city follow the fashion of Muslim women, are fluent of speech, wrap their cloaks about them, and are veiled.\n\nIbn Jubayr also travelled to Medina, Mecca, Damascus, Mosul, Acre and Baghdad. At Basra he saw how Indian timber was carefully used to make Lateen sail ships, returning in 1185 by way of Sicily. His path was not without troubles, including a shipwreck. On both occasions he travelled on Genoese ships.\n\nFrequently quoted is Jubayr's famous description of Muslims prospering under the Christian crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem:\nWe moved from Tibnin - may God destroy it - at daybreak on Monday. Our way lay through continuous farms and ordered settlements, whose inhabitants were all Muslims, living comfortably within the Franks... They surrender half their crops to the Franks at harvest time, and pay as well a poll-tax of one dinar and five qirat for each person. Other than that they are not interfered with, save for a light tax on the fruit of their trees. The houses and all their effects are left to their full possession. All the coastal cities occupied by the Franks are managed in this fashion, their rural districts, the villages and farms, belong to the Muslims. But their hearts have been seduced, for they observe how unlike them in ease and comfort are their brethren in the Muslim regions under their (Muslim) governors. This is one of the misfortunes afflicting the Muslims. The Muslim community bewails the injustice of the landlord of its own faith, and applauds the conduct of its opponent and enemy, the Frankish landlord, and is accustomed to justice from him.\n\nJubayr travelled to the East on two further occasions (1189–1191 and 1217), without leaving any account. He died on the 29 November 1217 in Alexandria during the second of these trips.\n\nIbn Jubayr provides a highly detailed and graphic description of the places he visited during his travels. The book differs from other contemporary accounts in not being a mere collection of toponyms and descriptions of monuments, but contains observation of geographical details as well as cultural, religious and political matters. Particularly interesting are his notes about the declining faith of his fellow Muslims in Palermo after the recent Norman conquest, and about what he perceived as the Muslim-influenced customs of king William II of Sicily (see Arabo-Norman civilization).\n\nHis writing is a foundation of the genre of work called Rihla, or the creative travelogue. This is a mix of personal narrative, description of the areas traveled and personal anecdotes.\n\nIbn Jubayr's travel chronicle served as a model for later authors, some of whom copied from it without attribution. Ibn Juzayy, who wrote the account of Ibn Battuta's travels in around 1355 A.D., copied passages that had been written 170 years earlier by Ibn Jubayr describing Damascus, Mecca, Medina and other places in the Middle East. Passages copied from Ibn Jubayr are also found in the writings of al-Sharishi, al-Abdari and Al-Maqrizi.\n\nA surviving copy of Ibn Jubayr's manuscript is preserved in the collection of the Leiden University Library. The 210 page manuscript was produced in Mecca in 875 A.H. (1470 A.D.) and appears to have been written at high speed: diacritic marks are often missing, words are omitted and there is confusion between certain pairs of letters. The complete Arabic text was first published in 1852 by the orientalist William Wright. An updated edition was published in 1907 by Michael Jan de Goeje. A translation into Italian by Celestino Schiaparelli was published in 1906, a translation into English by Ronald Broadhurst was published in 1952, and a translation into French by Maurice Gaudefroy-Demombynes appeared in three volumes between 1949 and 1956.\n\nJubair is widely identified as Jubair Al-Hakim from the video game series \"Assassin's Creed\", where he preaches in Damascus before being killed by the protagonist, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Two loops can be multiplied by concatenation. With this operation, the loop space is an \"A\"-space. That is, the multiplication is homotopy-coherently associative.\n\nThe set of path components of Ω\"X\", i.e. the set of based-homotopy equivalence classes of based loops in \"X\", is a group, the fundamental group \"π\"(\"X\").\n\nThe iterated loop spaces of \"X\" are formed by applying Ω a number of times.\n\nThere is an analogous construction for topological spaces without basepoint. The free loop space of a topological space \"X\" is the space of maps from the circle \"S\" to \"X\" with the compact-open topology. The free loop space of \"X\" is often denoted by formula_1. \nAs a functor, the free loop space construction is right adjoint to cartesian product with the circle, while the loop space construction is right adjoint to the reduced suspension. This adjunction accounts for much of the importance of loop spaces in stable homotopy theory. (A related phenomenon in computer science is currying, where the cartesian product is adjoint to the hom functor.) Informally this is referred to as Eckmann–Hilton duality.\n\nThe loop space is dual to the suspension of the same space; this duality is sometimes called Eckmann–Hilton duality. The basic observation is that\nwhere formula_3 is the set of homotopy classes of maps formula_4,\nand formula_5 is the suspension of A, and formula_6 denotes the natural homeomorphism. This homeomorphism is essentially that of currying, modulo the quotients needed to convert the products to reduced products.\n\nIn general, formula_7 does not have a group structure for arbitrary spaces formula_8 and formula_9. However, it can be shown that formula_10 and formula_11 do have natural group structures when formula_12 and formula_13 are pointed, and the aforementioned isomorphism is of those groups. Thus, setting formula_14 (the formula_15 sphere) gives the relationship\n\nThis follows since the homotopy group is defined as formula_17 and the spheres can be obtained via suspensions of each-other, i.e. formula_18.\n\n\n"}

His capital was based in Gulbarga region of Karnataka. His successor was his uncle Krishna I who extended his kingdom to all of Karnataka.\n\nThe Ellora record of Dantidurga narrates that he defeated the Chalukyas in 753 and took the titles \"Rajadhiraja\" and \"Parameshvara\". The inscription calls him son of Indra II. The Samangad inscription (modern Kholapur district, Maharashtra) states his mother was a Chalukyan princess from Gujarat called Bhavanaga. The same inscription states he defeated the invincible \"Karnata-Bala\" of the Badami Chalukyas. Further he defeated the kings of Lata (Gujarat), Malwa, Tanka, Kalinga and Sheshas (Nagas) in central India and performed many sacrifices. Though he conquered the Chalukyan Empire, it is clear from the Vakkaleri inscription of 757 that the Chalukyan Emperor Kirtivarman II retained control over his southern provinces up to the year 757. His daughter was married to a Pallava King Nandivarman II of Kanchi. Dantidurga helped Nandivarman recover Kanchi by warring against the Chalukyas.\n\nThe Navasari grant (c.739) throws light on his achievements in the era prior to Rashtrakuta independence. The Arab intention might have been to make inroads into South India. However, to the south of the Mahi River lay the powerful Chalukyan empire. The Chalukya viceroy at Navsari, Avanijanashraya Pulakeshin, decisively defeated the invading Arab forces as documented in the grant. The \"Tājika\" (Arab) army defeated was one that had attacked \"Kacchella, Saindhava, Saurashtra, Cavotaka, Maurya and Gurjara\" kings. Viceroy Pulakesi subsequently received the titles \"Solid Pillar of Deccan\" (\"Dakshināpatha-sādhāra\") and the \"Repeller of the Unrepellable\" (\"Anivartaka-nivartayitr\"). The Rashtrakuta prince Dantidurga, who was subsidiary to Chalukyas at this time, also played an important role in the battle.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2174343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174343", "title": "The Godfather (2006 video game)", "text": "The Godfather (2006 video game)\n\nThe Godfather is a 2006 open world action-adventure video game developed by EA Redwood Shores and published by Electronic Arts. Originally released in March 2006 for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox it was later released for the PlayStation Portable as The Godfather: Mob Wars, Xbox 360 as The Godfather, Wii as The Godfather: Blackhand Edition, and PlayStation 3 as The Godfather: The Don's Edition.\n\nThe game is based upon the 1972 film \"The Godfather\" and tells the story of a non-canon character, Aldo Trapani, whose rise through the ranks of the Corleone family intersects with the plot of the film on numerous occasions. His actions in the game often take the form of events that happened off screen in the film; for example, he avenges Bonasera's daughter, drives Vito Corleone to the hospital after he is shot, plants the gun for Michael Corleone to kill Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, and places the horse's head in Jack Woltz's bed. Although the game was condemned by Francis Ford Coppola, who claimed Paramount never told him about its development or asked for his input, it does feature voice acting from several stars of the film, including James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and Abe Vigoda as Salvatore Tessio. Marlon Brando also recorded dialogue for Vito Corleone, in what would be his final acting job, but his ill health made most of his recordings unusable.\n\n\"The Godfather\" received generally positive reviews across most systems, although the PlayStation Portable version was commonly seen as inferior to the others. The game was a commercial success, selling over two million units. In 2009, a sequel was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. Based on the 1974 film, \"The Godfather Part II\", the sequel did not sell as well nor do as well with critics as had the original, and EA scrapped plans for an adaptation of the third film.\n\n\"The Godfather\" is an open world action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective, in which the player controls Aldo Trapani as he ascends through the ranks of the Corleone family, with his rise intersecting with the narrative of the film on numerous occasions. The basic gameplay and game mechanics are similar to most open world titles as the player can travel across the city freely, commandeer vehicles, do whatever they want in terms of attacking and/or killing innocent civilians, and progress through the storyline at their own leisure, spending as much time traversing the city as they wish.\n\nMuch of the game is based around third-person shooting, with the player able to wield a .38 snub nose, a pistol, a magnum, a Tommy gun, and a shotgun, as well as projectiles such as Molotov cocktails and dynamite. The game features both a lock-on system and a manual aiming system. In the manual system, the players have complete freedom to aim wherever they wish. In the lock-on system, when the player locks a target, a targeting reticule appears on-screen. The longer the player is locked on, the smaller the reticule gets, allowing for more precise aiming. Within the lock-on system, the player also has a certain degree of freedom to aim manually; the reticule can be moved around the locked on target, allowing the player to target specific areas. If the reticule turns red, the player has found a weak point. All enemies have five weak points: their two knees and their two shoulders, plus their groin. If the player shoots one of their knees, the enemy will no longer be able to run, but will continue to shoot back. If the player hits a shoulder, the enemy won't be able to fire back or fight. Hitting the groin accomplishes the same effect as a knee shot, also stunning the target.\n\nThe other mode of combat in the game is melee combat, for which the game uses a system dubbed \"BlackHand\", after the Black Hand extortion method. Once the player has locked onto an NPC, either hostile or non-hostile, they use the right analog stick to engage in melee combat. The system allows for light attacks, heavy attacks and directional attacks. It also allows the player to swing the opponent around, drag them, strangle them, lift them to their feet if they fall to their knees, slam them against walls, smash their head against counters, throw them over ledges and out windows, and perform execution maneuvers when the opponent is suitably weakened. Players can also wield numerous melee weapons, such as baseball bats, tire irons, police batons, and wrenches. For the PlayStation 3 \"Don's Edition\" and the Wii \"Blackhand Edition\", the BlackHand system has been enhanced, utilizing the motion sensor capabilities of the SIXAXIS and the Wii Remote.\n\nA major part of \"The Godfather\"s gameplay is extorting businesses. The player must extort business to earn enough respect to level up, to complete certain missions, and to earn money. When the player is attempting to intimidate a business owner into paying protection money, a meter appears on screen with a green bar and a red bar. To get the owner to agree to pay, the player must intimidate them until the meter fills up to the green bar. After this point, the more intimidation the player can achieve, the more money the owner will pay out. However, if the meter passes the red bar, the owner will begin to fight back and will refuse to pay anything. Every business owner has a weak point, something they particularly fear, and if the player finds it, the amount of money paid out will rise faster than the meter fills, allowing the player to extort more money before the meter reaches the red zone. Intimidation methods include beating the owner up, throwing them around, smashing their shop, attacking customers, or pointing firearms at them. In the Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, the player will occasionally have the option of carrying out a favor for a business owner rather than intimidating them. This can involve carrying out a hit on someone, scaring someone, or going to a particular location at a particular time. If the player chooses to perform the favor, the amount of protection money paid by the owner will be maximized.\n\nThere are five main geographical regions in the game; Little Italy (controlled by the Corleone family), Brooklyn (controlled by the Tattaglia family), New Jersey (controlled by the Stracci family), Hell's Kitchen (controlled by the Cuneo family) and Midtown (controlled by the Barzini family). At the start of the game, the entire map is available for the player to explore, but the game encourages the player to remain in Little Italy, as it is the easiest area of which to gain control. To completely control an area, the player must extort all business and rackets owned by the other families, and take over their warehouses and hubs. Many businesses serve as fronts to rackets, which can be taken over in a similar manner to the front, although in the case of a racket, the player has the option of simply buying the racket boss out. Rackets yield more money than businesses.\n\nThe player can also gain control of warehouses and hubs. Warehouses supply rackets, and hubs supply warehouses. Both warehouses and hubs are heavily guarded, and the player must fight their way inside, and find the boss, who they can then intimidate as with business owners and racket bosses. Warehouses pay out more than rackets and hubs pay out more than warehouses. Ultimately, the player must tackle the enemies' strongest holdout - their compound. Once the compound is destroyed, that family has been defeated. To destroy a compound, the player must fight their way inside and then plant a bomb. All compounds have two buildings, both of which must be bombed. Each compound is heavily guarded by opposing family members.\n\nAs the player takes over a rival families' businesses and kills their men, their vendetta level will rise. If it gets too high, a mob war will break out. This results in members of the opposing family attacking the player on sight, and attempting to bomb Corleone owned businesses, rackets, warehouses and hubs. The only way to win a mob war is to bomb a rival family business or bribe an FBI agent to distract the opposing family until the vendetta level has lowered.\n\nAs well as vendetta levels, the player must also be aware of \"heat\" during the game. Shooting rival family members in public, killing innocent people, or attacking police officers will all raise heat levels. If the level gets too high, police will fire upon the player on sight. To avoid this, the player can bribe police to ignore them for a while. Bribing a police captain will earn the player more time during which the police turn a blind eye than bribing a street cop. In the Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3 versions, bribed police will often fight on the player's side in shootouts with rival families. Also in the Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3 versions, the player can blackmail rather than bribe the captain, but only if certain information has been learned from an NPC about the captain's activities.\n\nIn addition to extorting businesses and attempting to destroy rival families, the player must also engage in story missions. Completing story missions is the only way for the player to advance in rank in the Corleone family, moving from Outsider through the ranks of Enforcer, Associate, Soldier, Capo, Underboss, Don and, finally, Don of NYC. However, completing all of the storyline missions will only take the player to the level of Underboss. To achieve the Don of NYC level, the player must take over all rival businesses, rackets, warehouses, and hubs, destroy all compounds, and own every safehouse.\n\nApart from progressing in rank in the Corleone family, the other method of progression in the game involves \"Respect.\" Earning respect allows the player to level up, which awards skill points to spend on various attributes. Respect can be earned by numerous means, such as completing missions, extorting businesses, taking over rackets, blowing up safes, bribing police officers, robbing banks, successfully flirting with women, entering new areas, carrying out execution maneuvers or performing hits and favors.\n\nThe game begins in Little Italy in 1936. Johnny Trapani (voiced by Adam Harrington), an intermediate ranking member of the Corleone family, is meeting his wife, Sarafina (Sirenetta Leoni), when their bakery explodes. Trapani is then beaten up and killed by members of the Barzini family, with Emilio Barzini (Michael Kopsa) telling him \"sorry Johnny, it's just business.\" Moments later, Trapani's son Aldo (Andrew Pifko) arrives, and is comforted by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando/Doug Abrahams), who tells him that when he is old enough and the time is right, he will have his revenge.\n\nThe game then jumps to 1945. Sarafina comes to see Vito, telling him that Aldo has fallen in with a disreputable group of friends. Vito sends Luca Brasi (Garry Chalk) to find Aldo and recruit him into the family. After teaching Aldo how to fight and earn protection money, Brasi sends him to meet Paulie Gatto (Tony Alcantar), who introduces him to, Marty \"Monk\" Malone (Jason Schombing). Gatto has been assigned to take revenge on a group of men who attacked the daughter of an undertaker, Bonasera, a friend of Vito's. Gatto, Monk and Aldo beat up the gang, and Aldo then joins Brasi on a mission to meet with Bruno Tattaglia (Joe Paulino) and Virgil Sollozzo (Richard Newman). Several days previously, Vito refused to enter the cocaine trade with Sollozzo. Knowing that Sollozzo feels angered by this refusal, Vito is worried about revenge, and has sent Brasi to pretend he is unhappy working for the Corleones, and wishes to join the Tattaglia family, who are supporting Sollozzo. However, Bruno and Sollozzo kill Brasi, witnessed by Aldo through a window. He flees, meeting Monk and his sister, Frankie (Jennifer Copping). As Aldo explains what happened, there is an attempted hit on Vito nearby. Aldo ensures Frankie is safe, before helping Fredo (Andrew Moxham) transport Vito to the hospital.\n\nAldo then heads to the Corleone compound, where he meets caporegimes Peter Clemenza (Doug Abrahams) and Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda), acting Don Sonny Corleone (James Caan), and consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). Impressed with Aldo's bravery, Tom makes him an Enforcer, and Clemenza sends him to guard Vito in the hospital. Whilst there, Aldo meets Frankie, and the two make a date. Meanwhile, Michael Corleone (Joseph May) arrives, and finds all the Corleone guards gone, except Aldo. As a Tattaglia hit squad arrives, Aldo gets Frankie out of the building whilst Michael has a nurse move Vito's bed. Aldo then kills the hit squad. Police led by Captain McCluskey (Doug Abrahams), who is being paid by Sollozzo, arrive, ordering Michael and Aldo to leave. However, Tom arrives with a group of private detectives to guard Vito, and the police reluctantly allow them to enter.\n\nAt the compound, Tom promotes Aldo to Associate. Realizing it was Paulie who sold Vito out to Sollozzo, Sonny orders Clemenza to have him killed. Clemenza assigns the hit to Aldo. After Gatto is dead, Tom sends Aldo to accompany Rocco Lampone (Michael Dobson) to Hollywood to persuade a studio executive named Jack Woltz (Doug Abrahams) into giving Vito's godson, Johnny Fontane, the starring role in a new film. Rocco and Aldo decapitate Woltz' prized stallion, and place the head in his bed as he sleeps, terrifying him into casting Fontane. Back in New York, the Corleones purchase an apartment in Midtown for Aldo and Frankie. Sollozzo and McClusky arrange a meeting with Michael to try to bring the conflict to a peaceful resolution. However, Michael hopes to assassinate them. Clemenza has Aldo hide a gun in the toilet of the restaurant where the meeting is taking place, and Michael kills them both. Aldo then drives him to the docks, where he leaves for Sicily. Meanwhile, Vito is released from hospital and promotes Aldo to Soldier, officially making him a made man of the Corleone family.\n\nShortly thereafter, a group of Tattaglia soldiers kill Frankie. Sonny tells Aldo that Bruno Tattaglia ordered the hit, and is hiding at his funeral home. A furious Aldo heads there and kills Bruno. As Aldo returns to the compound, Sonny speeds off in a car. Carlo Rizzi has attacked Sonny's sister, and Sonny is heading to their house to kill him. On his way, he is killed by a Tattaglia hit squad. Aldo arrives moments later, interrogating the leader, who tells him the hit was not ordered by Philip Tattaglia (Bill Meilen), but by Emilio Barzini, who is secretly pulling Tattaglia strings. Upon hearing of Sonny's death, Vito calls an end to the war and arranges to meet the heads of the families. At the meeting, he assures Tattaglia there will be no retribution for the death of Sonny, on the condition that Michael be allowed to safely return to America. The families agree to this, and Vito makes peace with Tattaglia.\n\nAfter Michael returns, he becomes the new Don, with Vito retiring, and shortly thereafter, dying. Michael promotes Aldo to Caporegime. Learning the FBI are conducting an investigation into the Corleones, Michael sends Aldo and Monk to find out what they know. When Aldo arrives at the hotel used by the FBI, Monk tells him Michael has learned a Corleone informant is meeting with the FBI at that moment, and they are to kill him. They storm the hotel, and Monk kills a lone FBI agent, before escaping. Aldo realizes that Monk himself is the informant. Michael calls, telling Aldo he knew there was an informant but was unsure if it was Monk or Aldo, and the job was a ruse to smoke out the culprit. Aldo follows Monk, who admits he blamed the Corleone family for Frankie's death, and allied with the Cuneo family. Incredulous with Monk's betrayal, Aldo kills him.\n\nAldo returns to the compound to see Tessio held at gun point. Tom explains Tessio had set Michael up to be murdered - he had arranged a meeting between Michael and the Barzini family at which Michael would be killed. Aldo heads to the meeting with Tessio, killing the Barzini assassins and then killing Tessio. Michael then summons Aldo to a church in Little Italy where he is acting as godfather for his sister's son. During the ceremony, Michael has Aldo assassinate the heads of the four families - Victor Stracci, Carmine Cuneo, Philip Tattaglia, and Emilio Barzini. With the aid of Clemenza, Willi Cicci (Gavin Hammon), Rocco Lampone and Al Neri (Terence McGovern), Aldo carries out each hit, finally avenging the death of his father at the hands of Barzini. Michael then promotes Aldo to Underboss. If the player keeps playing at this point, and Aldo bombs all four rival family compounds, he is promoted to Don of New York.\n\n\"The Godfather\" was first announced by Electronic Arts on March 10, 2004. Speaking at the Bear Stearns Media, Entertainment & Information Conference in Palm Beach, Florida, EA's CFO Warren Jensen confirmed rumors that EA were working on a \"Godfather\" game. No other details were revealed except for the fact that it would \"likely be an M-rated game,\" making it EA's first ever M-rated title. The game was first shown at the 2004 Spike Video Game Awards on December 14. Slated for a third quarter release in 2005 on as yet unspecified current generation systems, EA showed a pre-rendered cutscene depicting Vito Corleone drinking wine, scratching his cheek, and then looking into the camera and saying \"Some day, and that day may never come, I may call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, accept this, as a gift.\"\n\nGameplay details remained unknown until January 2005, when \"Famitsu\" published an interview with producer Hunter Smith. He revealed the game would be an open world title in the vein of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" games, and that, at present, developers EA Redwood Shores had one-hundred-and-twenty staff working full-time on the game, with that number expected to increase to two-hundred in the coming months. He stated that although the game itself was only 15% complete, the narrative was finalized; players would control an original character who begins as a small-time member of the Corleone family, and must work his way up through the ranks. He stated that EA had wanted to make an open-world game for some time; \"We wanted to make a title with the same style of open world, but with a strong background, one where you build human relationships while creating your own story.\" He also explained that the player's progression path through the game could be determined by the player, but would intersect with the plot of the film at certain points, and the player would get to participate in famous scenes from the movie; \"It's constructed so that players will appear in the scene and will feel as if they are alive within it.\"\n\nOn February 1, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" revealed Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall had been hired to reprise their roles as Vito Corleone, Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen, respectively. All three had also allowed EA to use their likenesses in the game, with both Caan and Duvall doing facial motion capture work. Although Brando had died in July of the previous year, he had recorded dialogue for the game prior to his death, in what was his last acting job. It was also revealed that EA had acquired the rights to Nino Rota's score for the film. Later that same day, EA released its first official statement regarding the game, announcing it was being released for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Microsoft Windows and PlayStation Portable. Executive producer David De Martini stated \"We are incredibly excited and honored to have the opportunity to bring the fiction of \"The Godfather\" to life in a video game. \"The Godfather\" movies raised the standard for cinematic achievement with their high level of drama and intense storytelling, and in fall 2005 gamers will be able to experience that dangerous and living world of \"The Godfather\" for themselves.\"\n\nThe game officially premiered on February 10, in a red carpet event held in Little Italy, with James Caan, Robert Duvall and Johnny Martino (who played Paulie Gatto in the film) in attendance. At the event, it was announced that a playable demo would not be available until the E3 event in May. David De Martini explained the game had already been in development for two years, including a full year of preproduction and research. He revealed the developers had worked closely with Mark Winegardner, author of \"The Godfather Returns\", to ensure the storyline stayed within the canon of the narrative, and maintained the correct tone. De Martini also stated that as well as Rota's score, Bill Conti and Ashley Irwin had composed one-hundred minutes of new music for the game.\n\nIn the build-up to E3 in May, EA announced the game would also be released for a next-generation platform; the Xbox 360. At the event itself, a playable demo was made available to journalists, but not to the public. The demo debuted the \"BlackHand\" control system, which had been developed by the inventor of the swing mechanism in the \"Tiger Woods PGA Tour\" franchise.\n\nSpeaking to GameSpot in June, David De Martini stated the original idea for the project was Paramount's, who first approached EA about a game adaptation of the film in early 2003. After numerous meetings, the concept was decided upon; a \"dual-story\" game that would feature a character moving through an open world and rising through the ranks of the Corleone family, whilst at the same time, following the plot of the film. De Martini explained\n\nHe stated \"We wanted the game to heavily focus on what went on behind the scenes and in the living world. Not the ordering around but rather the actual activities that the order takers had to do on a daily basis to move the family interests forward.\" He also promised the game would be unlike any other open world game;\n\nIn July, \"The New York Times\" reported that Marlon Brando would not be voicing all of Vito Corleone's dialogue. Although Brando did record dialogue prior to his death, \"his actual voice will not appear in the game [...] rather, his recordings are guiding a professional voice mimic.\" The article claimed that Brando's ailing health meant he could only breathe with the aid of an oxygen tank, the noise of which was picked up on the audio recordings, making them unusable in the game. After publication of the article, EA confirmed \"we recorded multiple sessions with a sound-alike to capture the entire performance of the Don Vito character, something we were not able to do with Mr. Brando.\" However, they hoped that some of his audio may still make it into the game. Although it was already known that Al Pacino had turned down the opportunity to voice Michael Corleone, the article also revealed he had refused to lend his likeness to the game. Instead, Pacino had allowed Radical Entertainment to use his likeness for their upcoming game for Sierra Entertainment, \"\".\n\nOn July 13, EA announced the game would also be ported to the Wii. Although they revealed no further information, they did state the port would be custom built to take advantage of the Wii Remote. The following day, they announced the initial release of the game had been pushed to March 2006 so as to \"ensure quality.\" De Martini explained \"\"The Godfather\" is one of the most cherished franchises in entertainment. Releasing the game in early 2006 allows us more time to perfect the open-world experience of being a member of the Corleone family.\"\n\nIn January 2006, speaking to \"GameSpot\", De Martini said of the delay, \"When you are dealing with a property like \"The Godfather\", you have to take special care in making sure your work meets the level fans have come to expect from the franchise. With this fiction in our game, we had to hit a home run. I am tremendously thankful that EA gave our team the time we needed to get it right. I think it turned a good game into a great one.\"\n\nIn an interview with IGN, he further explained,\n\nOn January 18, EA confirmed the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows versions would be released in March, with the PSP and Xbox 360 versions scheduled for later in the year. On January 26, it was announced the game would be released in North America on March 21. The game went gold on March 14.\n\nIn April 2005, Francis Ford Coppola, director of the three \"Godfather\" films, was asked about the game on AMC's \"Sunday Morning Shootout\". He responded,\n\nHowever, the game's executive producer, David De Martini, implied Coppola did know about the game well in advance of its development, stating,\n\nIn June 2008, Anthony Puzo, son of author Mario Puzo, sued Paramount Pictures, claiming that a 1992 agreement between his father and Paramount entitled the author (or, as Mario had died in 1999, his estate) to a share of the profits generated from any audio-visual products based on or using elements of the films or novels. The court filing stated, \"In material breach of the audio-visual products agreement, Paramount has failed and refused to pay the Puzo Estate the sums due it in respect of the \"Godfather\" game.\" In February 2009, Puzo won the suit, with Paramount paying out an undisclosed sum, thought to be in the region of several million dollars.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable version of the game was announced on February 1, 2005, alongside the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows versions. Originally scheduled for release with the other versions in Fall 2005, and then rescheduled for March 2006, the game was ultimately released in September 2006. There was no indication the PSP version would be a different game until July 11, 2006, when Electronics Boutique and GameStop changed their listing from simply \"The Godfather\" to The Godfather: Mob Wars, although there was no change in the game's content description on either website. The following day, EA confirmed the PSP version would indeed be called \"Mob Wars\" and would not be the same game as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows versions.\n\nAt a press event on July 13, 2006, EA debuted \"Mob Wars\". The main difference between this version and the others is that \"Mob Wars\" does not feature an open-world environment in which the player is free to move around and extort whatever businesses they wish. Instead, the game features two distinct game modes; \"Story Mode\" and \"Mob Wars.\" The \"Mob Wars\" mode replaces the open world element from the other versions of the game and is played from a top down view in which the player moves units in a turn-based strategy fashion, attempting to capture space owned by the rival families. An important element in this is a card battling mini-game which features a pool of over two-hundred cards with effects such as lowering vendetta levels, strengthening defenses, and allowing extra moves in a given turn.\n\nFor \"Story Mode,\" the game switches to a 3D third-person perspective similar to that of the other versions, with the same lock-on system, and shooting and grappling mechanics. In \"Mob Wars\" mode, each turn has three phases; \"Recruiting\", \"Negotiation\", and \"Intimidation\". \"Recruiting\" allows the player to hire guards to protect already owned territory. \"Negotiation\" allows the player to select which cards they wish to use. \"Intimidation\" sees the player moving their units around the map, attempting to extort rival businesses. The player is free to play through \"Story Mode\" without playing \"Mob Wars,\" or to play \"Mob Wars\" as much as they wish between missions in \"Story Mode.\" Like in the other versions of the game, businesses taken over in \"Mob Wars\" yield money, which can be used to purchase better weaponry for use in \"Story Mode\". Like in the open world environment of the other versions of the game, to completely defeat a rival family, the player must destroy their compound. Also as in the other versions of the game, to finish the game to 100%, the player must complete all story missions in \"Story Mode\", and successfully extort all businesses, rackets, warehouses and hubs, and destroy all compounds in \"Mob Wars\" mode.\n\nOriginally announced on May 12, 2005, the Xbox 360 version was named The Godfather. Initially scheduled for a March 2006 release, when the PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC versions were pushed back from Fall 2005 to March 2006, the Xbox 360 and PSP versions were pushed back to September. Regarding the delay, executive producer David De Martini explained \"The 360 version of the game will be released later this year, and we will be using the time between our March ship and the 360 version ship to take full advantage of the hardware with some key design modifications that will make the game rock on that platform.\"\n\nThe game was first shown at an EA press event on July 13, 2006. Designer Mike Olsen explained the 360 version \"is 100% of the game on the Xbox, plus some.\" Graphically, the game features dynamic weather and diurnal cycles, and an enhanced particle system. All of the rackets feature new textures and geographical layouts, so they no longer all look the same, and each of the rival family compounds is completely different, with bomb locations different from compound to compound. The game also features new lighting and particle effects. In terms of gameplay, the game adds a favor system whereby rather than intimidating shop owners, the player can carry out favors for them. The player can also carry out favors for family members, in much the same way as they can carry out hits. A major addition to the game is the ability for the player to hire Corleone soldiers to join Aldo in combat. This can involve individually hiring a single family member, or hiring a crew of four men who accompany the player everywhere until they are dismissed or killed. Individual crew members cost different amounts, but the more expensive they are, the better they fight. A full crew can only be hired periodically; when a meter on the HUD is full. The game also features new story missions, such as rescuing Tom Hagen from Sollozzo, bombing Sollozzo's drug factories, and assassinating Moe Greene. The aiming system has also been tweaked, and the melee combat system has had additional combat moves added. Twenty-six new execution styles have also been added to the twenty-two existing ones.\n\nIn an interview with IGN, art manager Mark Lohff stated\n\nCreative director Michael Perry stated\n\nReleased in March 2007, the Wii version was originally announced on July 13, 2005. Nothing further was heard until January 10, 2006, when GameFly listed the game under the title The Godfather: Blackhand Edition. The following day, EA confirmed this title. They also announced the Wii version would feature all of the graphical and gameplay enhancements of the Xbox 360 version. New to the Wii edition would be an enhanced upgrade system which allowed the player to spend their upgrade points on more specific attributes. The game would allow for two upgrade paths - \"Enforcer\" and \"Operator\". Enforcer would concentrate on fighting and shooting skills, whilst Operator would feature monetary enhancements, intimidation aids and health upgrades. The Wii version would also feature an enhanced \"BlackHand\" control system making use of the Wii Remote's unique capabilities.\n\nIn an interview with IGN, Joel Wade, producer of the Wii and PlayStation 3 versions, stated\n\nThe \"Blackhand Edition\" uses both the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk; if an enemy is on their knees, the player can pull the controllers upwards to lift them off the ground. Similarly, swinging the controllers from side to side swings an enemy around. Melee combat is similar to \"Wii Sports Boxing\" - the player literally throws the type of punch they want Aldo to throw in the game. Slamming enemies against walls is accomplished by shoving the controllers towards the screen, and head-butts, by quickly raising them upwards. The remote can also be used for executions, which require specific gestures, for opening doors, and for reloading weapons. For example, to reload a shotgun, the player must move the Nunchuk upwards and then quickly downwards to mimic the pump action of the weapon, and to reload a revolver, the player must flick the Nunchuk as if emptying the cylinder.\n\nReleased on the same day in March 2007 as the Wii version, and developed alongside it, the PlayStation 3 version was the last version of the game announced, and was not revealed until January 10, 2007, when GameFly listed it under the title The Godfather: The Don's Edition. The following day, EA confirmed the game would be coming to PlayStation 3 under this title, with all the graphical and gameplay enhancements of both the Xbox 360 version and the Wii version (including the deeper upgrade system). In a statement, EA said the \"Don's Edition\" would \"take full advantage\" of the SIXAXIS controller's motion sensor, and would also feature added gameplay in the form of \"The Corleone Expansion Pack.\"\n\n\"The Don's Edition\" features a more basic form of the gesture-based BlackHand control scheme seen in the Wii version. The game uses the SIXAXIS' motion sensor functionality in interrogations and, to a limited degree, during melee combat. As in the Wii, if the player wishes to lift someone from their knees, they simply pull the controller upwards. Swinging the controller from side to side swings the enemy likewise. Slamming someone against a wall is accomplished by pushing the controller away from the player. Unlike in the Wii version, however, where shooting and driving were handled using the Wii Remote, in \"The Don's Edition\", shooting and driving are controlled using the analog sticks.\n\nUnique to \"The Don's Edition\" are the \"Corleone challenges\". These are time based minigames that have no effect on the story. The player must see how much of a certain action they can accomplish in a given time - such as how many different execution styles they can perform, how many banks they can rob, or many businesses they can extort etc. When the game first came out, the player's scores were uploaded to an online leaderboard. EA shut down their servers for the game on April 13, 2012, meaning players can no longer upload their scores. However, the mini-games are still playable.\n\n\"The Godfather\" received \"generally favorable reviews\" on all systems except the PlayStation Portable, which received \"mixed to average reviews.\" The Xbox version holds an aggregate scores of 77 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on fifty-eight reviews; the Wii version 77 out of 100, based on thirty-eight reviews; the PlayStation 2 version 75 out of 100, based on fifty-six reviews; the Xbox 360 version 77 out of 100, based on fifty-one reviews; the PC version 72 out of 100, based on thirty-two reviews; the PlayStation 3 version 70 out of 100, based on thirty-one reviews; and the PlayStation Portable version 59 out of 100, based on thirty-four reviews.\n\nGameSpot's Greg Mueller scored the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 8.1 out of 10, calling the game \"a satisfying, lengthy adventure,\" and arguing \"it remains faithful to the classic film while managing to create a compelling story of its own [...] it handles the source material respectfully and manages to offer enough new content to feel like more than just a by-the-numbers adaptation of the movie.\" IGN's Douglass C. Perry scored the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 7.9 out of 10, with the Xbox version finishing as runner-up in the March 2006 \"Xbox Game of the Month\" award, losing to \"Far Cry Instincts: Evolution\". Perry praised the concept of placing a new character in the existing narrative; \"Much of the story is carefully untarnished, so when you see pivotal scenes, they will be left relatively untouched. You'll hear and see these key scenes unfolding in front of you, but you'll be in the house, the car, the church, or the hospital as a close associate, rather than a bystander. You'll feel like an insider who's part of a great powerful narrative, and the feeling is eerily remarkable.\" Although he was critical of the melee combat and the driving portions of the game, he called the extortion system \"awesome fun.\" He concluded, \"people looking for a perfect game will be disappointed [but] there are elements that totally stand out from any similar games in this genre, from the extortion system to the business take-over model. Despite obvious areas in need of improvement, I had a blast playing \"The Godfather\".\" GameSpy's Will Tuttle scored the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 3.5 out of 5. Praising the use of the license, he wrote \"the game is best viewed as a complementary addition to the \"Godfather\" universe,\" calling it \"an ultimately entertaining sandbox game that doesn't really do much to help or hurt the license.\"\n\n\"Game Informer\"s Andrew Reiner scored the PlayStation 2 version 7.5 out of 10, writing \"while failing to transform the classic film into an engrossing interactive experience, the game does shine when it doesn't have to rely on the film license to pull it along.\" \"GameSpy\"'s William Abner scored the PC version 3 out of 5, and was critical of the use of the license; \"where the original movie was full of political intrigue, wicked subplots and occasional gratuitous violence, the game is \"all\" about the violence.\" He wrote \"Being a \"Godfather\" game, you'd expect things to be a bit less \"insane\" than your run-of-the-mill \"Grand Theft Auto\" clone. But there's more gunplay, more \"Blues Brothers\"-inspired car chases, and more thuggery in general, in 30 minutes of the game than in the entire movie trilogy.\" He concluded \"if you can think of it as a generic gangland-themed game without constantly comparing it to the films it borrows its license from, you can certainly have a good time. That said, it's hard to play \"The Godfather\" without thinking that this was a missed opportunity.\" Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored the Xbox version 6 out of 10, calling it \"way too short, far too easy, too damned repetitive and far too in awe of \"Grand Theft Auto\" to be held up as anything other than a rather lightweight copycat offering.\" Although he was critical of the length of the game's story in relation to the extortion gameplay, he felt the combat went some way to redeeming the game; \"the one main saving grace is that the combat is actually fun enough to nullify the overwhelming repetition.\" He argued the game \"offers a decent amount of fun, with great combat, occasionally inspired set-pieces, but sub-par driving and a half-baked story mode with barely enough variety to fill a long evening.\"\n\nIGN's Chris Roper scored \"Mob Wars\" 6.2 out of 10, writing \"there are a number of areas where the ball was dropped.\" He was mildly impressed with the card gameplay, but felt it wasn't enough to \"help the game rise above mediocrity.\" He called the game \"an interesting idea, but it doesn't feel cohesive enough or like either part was pushed as far as it could go.\" \"GameSpot\"'s Greg Mueller scored it 6 out of 10. He too was more impressed with Mob Wars mode than Story Mode, writing \"it sounds like the makings of an experiment gone awry, like some sort of Frankenstein's monster of game design, but it's actually playable--and even fun.\" However, he called the connection between Story Mode and Mob Wars \"tenuous and disjointed.\" He concluded \"\"Mob Wars\" doesn't live up to its potential. There are some flashes of a good game in there, and you might have fun for the first couple of hours, but unfortunately that enjoyment is fleeting, and you'll be left feeling aggravated and disappointed.\"\n\n\"GameSpy\"'s Justin Speer scored it 3 out of 5. He too was critical of the connection between Story Mode and Mob Wars, and concluded \"it can't hold itself together well enough to deliver a really satisfying game experience.\" \"Game Informer\"s Andrew Reiner scored it 4.5 out of 10, stating \"Electronic Arts couldn't quite get \"The Godfather\" to run correctly on the PSP, but that didn't stop them from releasing it. Applying cement shoes to the experience, [EA have] stripped all of the open world gameplay from this version, leaving nothing but the lame missions and a putrid \"Risk\"-like minigame.\"\n\n\"GameSpy\"&apos;s David Chapman scored the Xbox 360 version 4 out of 5, calling it \"definitely the version to pick up.\" \"GameSpot\"'s Greg Mueller scored it 7.9 out of 10, writing \"for the most part, this is the same game that was released six months earlier.\" IGN's Douglass C. Perry also scored it 7.9 out of 10, calling it \"essentially the same game with minor visual and gameplay upgrades. If you played the current-gen version, this plays exactly the same, but every so often you'll see or experience a surprising little tweak.\" He concluded \"EA upgraded a bunch of little things and improved the overall experience. But gamers have higher expectations for next-generation titles, and \"The Godfather\" looks and plays exactly like what it is: a good upgraded current-gen game.\"\n\n\"Game Informer\"s Matt Helgeson scored it 7.75 out of 10, calling it \"still the same flawed game that was released for the current-gen systems.\" \"Eurogamer\"'s Kristan Reed scored it 6 out of 10, writing \"the changes and improvements are so minor that you might not have noticed them were they not written down for you. Tellingly, none of them really address the fundamental gripes that dragged the game down in the first place.\" He was critical of the graphics, arguing \"the game looks like a port from the word go. The low-poly character models, stilted animation and bland texture detail of the original is exposed even more once you see it running in high def.\" He concluded \"the core of \"The Godfather\" can be quite harmlessly entertaining. Like so many openworld games, there's a moreishness to it that keeps you going even when so many alarm bells are ringing about where EA went wrong. But let's face it, \"The Godfather\" should have been far better than it is.\"\n\nIGN's Mark Bozon scored the Wii version 8 out of 10. It would go on to win the March 2007 \"Wii Game of the Month\" award. Bozon wrote \"it incorporates a ton of great actions with the Wii controller, is one of the better looking games on the system, and actually banks on the system's strong points.\" Of the controls, he wrote \"after playing it on Wii I really can't see people wanting to go back to the traditional controls.\" \"Eurogamer\"'s Richard Leadbetter scored it 7 out of 10, writing \"While most of the gameplay flaws inherent in the previous versions are still there in this new version, there are a number of factors that may make this far more appealing to the average Wii owner [...] this is generally a decent, well-thought out and enjoyable conversion.\" \"Game Informer\"s Andrew Reiner scored it 6.5 out of 10, writing \"the redeveloped skill tree is a step in the right direction, but the sloppy motion-based combat and IR targeting make the game even more painful than it was on the other machines.\"\n\nIGN's Chris Roper scored the PlayStation 3 version 7.5 out of 10, calling it \"certainly the best version of the bunch.\" Of the controls, he wrote \"it doesn't feel as rewarding or \"realistic\" as EA would have liked. Really, it just feels like you're \"suggesting\" what should happen and then hoping it does.\" He was also critical of the graphics; \"its visuals are simply poor for a next-generation title. Other than the high-definition output, it doesn't look like anything has been noticeably changed. Texture resolution is pretty bad, some of the effects are very last-gen and it really does look like you're playing a PS2 game in HD.\" He concluded \"the game is a strong and rather noticeable improvement over the original release, though much of it does feel outdated on the PlayStation 3. EA has done a great job of expanding nearly every facet of the game, [but] with last-gen visuals, a frustrating city layout and other issues that plagued the original release, it's still far from perfect.\" \"Game Informer\"s Matt Helgeson also scored it 7.5 out of 10, writing \"it still doesn't solve the problems I have with the game as a whole, which remain largely the same.\" He concluded \"\"The Godfather\"s uninspired craftsmanship falls short of being a truly compelling game experience.\"\n\nGreg Mueller from \"GameSpot\" scored both versions 7.6 out of 10. Of the controls, he wrote \"at times the movements don't seem to register properly unless you use exaggerated gestures.\" \"GameSpy\"'s Patrick Joynt scored the PlayStation 3 version 3 out of 5 and the Wii version 3.5 out of 5, and was critical of the game's use of its license; \"Sickening bloodlust and a fondness for repetition are essential skills for enjoying \"The Godfather\", placing an otherwise decent open-world game at direct odds with its own license and identity.\" However, he also felt that \"once you get over the disconnect of the license and the gameplay, the missions are plentiful and entertaining.\" He concluded \"a licensed game doesn't need to be slavishly adhered to the property it's coming from. And the actual gameplay here isn't half-bad. But like slapping the word \"art\" on a toilet, there's a constant dissonance between the license and the gameplay.\"\n\n\"The Godfather\" sold well across all platforms. In the first week of the game's North American release, the PlayStation 2 version was Blockbuster's top rental title, with the Xbox version coming in second. Together, the two titles rented more copies than the rest of the top ten combined. During its first three months on release, the game sold over one million units across PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC. In the game's first week on release in the UK, it entered the charts at #1, knocking \"\" from the top spot. It remained in the top ten chart for eight weeks.\n\nAt the 2006 Spike Video Game Awards, the game received three nominations; \"Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show\", \"Best Supporting Male Performance\" (James Caan as Sonny Corleone) and \"Best Cast\". It lost in the first category to \"\", Caan lost to James Gandolfini for \"\", and \"Best Cast\" went to \"Family Guy Video Game!\" At the 2007 Game Audio Network Guild (G.A.N.G.) Awards, composers Ashley Irwin and Bill Conti won the award for \"Best Arrangement of a Non-Original Score.\"\n"}

{"id": "2174352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174352", "title": "Mbalmayo", "text": "Mbalmayo\n\nMbalmayo is a city in Cameroon's Centre Province. The town had 60,091 inhabitants in 2012. It is the capital of the Nyong and So'o division. It is located at the banks of the Nyong river between Ebolowa and Yaoundé. It is an agricultural centre and has an important function as a centre of education. Site of the Mbalmayo National Forestry School.\n\nMbalmayo had existed since 1910 during the German rule of the then Kamerun. Mbalmayo was founded by Mbala Meyo, one of the first ruler of the town. As was the custom of chiefs who rule large communities prior to colonialism, villages and town were named after the chief. This trend of events could be seen in the other neighboring town and villages such as Akonolinga, Nanga Ebogo and Abong Bang, just to name a few.\n\nThe Germans had administrative control over the town and made use of the Nyong river for transportation of timber which was a major source of income. Due to its economic potentials, the Germans before the First World War had intended to establish an administrative headquarters in Mbalmayo. Also partly because they found a rock in the Nyong river with a protruded rounded wait which was attractive especially for touristic activities. However, immediately after the first world war in 1919, when Germany had to cede power to the Allied Forces, the project was never realized. The Town was handed to the French as French protectorate by the United Nations.\n\nMbalmayo is an industrial town that is about 41 km from Yaoundé the Capital of Cameroon. Mbalmayo is located in the Central Province of Cameroon. It is situated along the Nyong River, south of Yaoundé. Since it is deeply entrenched in the dense equatorial forest zone that stretched to the South, its natural physical environmental features makes it strategically economical located. The main economic activities are forestry and agriculture. There is a plywood factory powered by electricity from the Edea Hydroelectric Power Station.\n\nIt is also a commercial centre due to its position at the junction of three transportation routes: it lies on the main road south from Yaoundé; it is the terminus of the Camrail railway from Douala; and serves as a river port on the Nyong River, which is seasonally navigable for from Mbalmayo east to Abong Mbang. In order to improve and to increase its economic activities, the Government of Cameroon in 1989, through partnership with the African Development Bank was able to construct a 101 km road that links Mbalmayo with Ebolowa, the capital of the South Province. Amongst its economic activities, Timber exploration is a major source of revenue for Mbalmayo and Cameroon in general. There is the Mbalmayo's forest reserve which is one of Cameroon's oldest forest reserve. Other cash crops include palm oil, palm kernel oil, coffee and cocoa.\n\nCameroon is divided administratively into ten provinces now referred to as regions. Administration of these provinces are based on the political party in power. Mbalmayo is politically and administratively managed under the Central province/region. It is a sub-division of the Nyong-et-So'o Division of the Central Province. The administration of the division and the subdivisions is directly under the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization. Mbalmayo is the administrative headquarters of the Nyong et So'o division. Since independence, this division has been headed by two political parties- The CNU and the CPDM. However, ironically, these two parties were just the same party that underwent a name change. In 1985, CNU was changed to CPDM-Cameroon People Democratic Movement under the leadership of Paul Biya. Since 1968, there have been 6 Mayors elected in Mbalmayo. The longest-serving mayor was AMOUGOU MBIDA Samuel, who served as Mayor of the city Council for 17 years. He was also the Mayor in place during the political transition from Amadou Ahidjo to Paul Biya, and from the CNU to the CPDM.\n\nMayors of the Mbalmayo Municipal Council\n\nA good transport network is very critical for any real development to take place. Generally, most towns and villages in Cameroon are not easily accessible due to the poor road and transport network. Mbalmayo is, however, accessible by asphalt roads from Yaounde. By train it is the southern terminus of the railroad from Douala. The river Nyong is also commonly used as a mean of transport by locals and fishermen. The river runs for 250 km from Mbalmayo to the east of Abong-Mbang.\nUnderstanding the role of transport in economic development, the Government of Cameroon in 1987, secured a loan worth UA 47.15 million from the African Development Bank to finance the construction of a dual carriage way between Mbalmayo and Ebolowa in the south. The project was completed in 1991 by the firms COGEFAR Cameroon and Razel-Bec and works were supervised by BCEOM Cameroon and LABOGENIE. The project covered over 100 km of paved road.\n\nThe project has contributed significantly to opening up of the southern province and made possible the development of agriculture and forest production in the project area. Since timber harvesting is the biggest contributor to the economy of the southern province, transportation of both humans and goods have been made easy. \"Thanks to the improvement of travelling conditions and the lowering of transport costs, women play a more important role in production and in the associative life of the region. Trade, particularly in\nfood commodities between Cameroon and her neighbours has intensified since the commissioning of the road. Nevertheless, the road’s contribution to increased regional integration will be significant only when the entire Yaoundé-Libreville route, which has several sections in poor condition, has been developed.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2174380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174380", "title": "Sparkle (1976 film)", "text": "Sparkle (1976 film)\n\nSparkle is a 1976 American musical drama film directed by Sam O'Steen and released by Warner Bros. Pictures. With a plot inspired by the history of The Supremes, \"Sparkle\" is a period film set in Harlem, New York during the late 1950s and early 1960s. It presents the story of a musical girl group that ends up breaking apart due to individual issues each member faces. This film not only \"recreates the magic of a special period in American history, but it explores the impact of Harlem's musical and social culture on the rest of the world\", as well as the linkages to black power.\n\nThe film stars Irene Cara, Philip Michael Thomas, Lonette McKee, Dwan Smith, Mary Alice, Dorian Harewood, and Tony King. Curtis Mayfield served as the composer and producer of \"Sparkle\"s songs and score.\n\nThe film received generally negative reviews at the time of release and was a box office disappointment, only making $4 million against a $1 million budget. It since received a cult following. The film was remade in 2012 starring Jordin Sparks, Carmen Ejogo, Tika Sumpter, and Whitney Houston in her final film role.\n\nThe movie begins in Harlem, New York in 1958, and follows the girl group, Sister and the Sisters, which is made up of three sisters: Sister, Sparkle, and Delores. Stix, Sparkle's love interest and the group's manager, is able to help bring the group from \"amateur nights to brief stardom before tragedy (dope, melancholia, the wrong man)\" ensues and the group splits. Stix gives up on his music career and leaves the city and thus breaking Sparkle's heart. Sister is in an abusive relationship and is hung up on drugs while Delores leaves the city in pursuit of racial equality. In the end, after reconnecting after Sister's funeral, it is only Sparkle and Stix who climb the ladder to success. In short, this is a rags to riches story.\n\nLonne Elder, writer of the Academy Award nominated screenplay for \"Sounder\" drafted Sparkle, which Joel Schumacher edited to make a 200-page basis for the film, this film would be his screenwriting debut. \nJohn Calley was running Warner Bros. at the time and said Sam O'Steen had to direct the film. He was the famous editor of \"Carnal Knowledge,\" \"Rosemary's Baby\", and \"Chinatown\". This film was Sam O'Steen's debut film as a film director and given the limited budget, he did his best to use what was available to him. The film's story and plot were heavily inspired by the real-life singing group Diana Ross and the Supremes.\n\nIn addition, good casting and introducing newer faces was an important feature of the film, something that did not take too much of the budget. There were over 2,000 young ladies who auditioned for the role of Sparkle; Irene Cara ended up with the role and was just 17 when she was cast, she would become the film's breakout star as she went on to do films like Fame. With her other cast mates, the trio \"combine their extraordinary freshness and talent to sing to the music of Curtis Mayfield, who composed the music for the film produced by Howard Rosenman.\" None of the actors cast were big names at the time and many were newcomers, Lonette McKee actually made her feature film debut in this film.\n\nCredit must also be given to cinematographer Bruce Surtees and all other technicians who worked on the film.\n\nLester Wilson choreographed the movie, and his assistant was Michael Peters, who went on to choreograph “Beat It” and “Thriller” for Michael Jackson.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, music paralleled black identity and culture. The early 1960s consisted of freedom music, a direct descendant of gospel music. This genre was aimed at building strong relationships during difficult times by connecting people. Sam Cooke and Freedom Singers are an example of these artists. The late 1960s to early 1970s consisted of soul music which tied in with historical macro events such as: Middle Civil Rights Movement, Great Society, Vietnam War, and Black Power. Soul music encourages everyone to be happy. Some influential artists during this time were James Brown, The Supremes, Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder. Next, the mid 1970s consisted of funk music. These songs were political and group focused. Some of these artists include Earth Wind and Fire, Sly and the Family Stone, Parliament Funkadelic, Kool & The Gang, Labelle, and Chaka Khan. Finally, the middle to late 1970s consisted of disco which was essentially peppy dance music. Stand out artists include Gloria Gaynor, Sister Sledge, Diana Ross, and Donna Summer. Within these genres, there are themes of self-determination, racial pride, and having fun. Sparkle captured all these themes as it spans musical genres. All the songs were adapted to the sound of the times, making the film relevant and powerful. \nAretha Franklin had a large role with the music that was featured in the film. She even has an entire album called \"Sparkle.\" The other songs in the film were written by Curtis Mayfield. The songs were a huge hit.\n\nWhile analyzing gender and sexuality, the Black female protagonists in this film can easily be compared to the women in \"Cleopatra Jones\" and \"Coffy\". Unlike these films, Sparkle’s protagonists do not come out on top in the same way as Cleo and Coffy do.\n\nCompared to Coffy and Cleo, these women are much more conservative in their looks and the way they convey themselves. Regarding female empowerment, their physical appearance is the only attribute they have and they use it as a tool. In other words, it is their only weapon. Coffy and Cleo both had actual guys and weapons at their disposal to use along with their physical appearance. Going off of this, the sisters are much weaker when looking at female empowerment, especially when there is Coffy and Cleo in the picture.\n\nIt is interesting how in Jacquie Jones' essay, \"Construction of Black Sexuality\", “the Black male character, as defined through his sexual behavior, is not able to overcome the problematic of domination which begins with a denial of dependency. Instead, the Black male character can only define himself through violent separateness” (250). One very disturbing scene in the film was when Sister and her boyfriend Satin are lying together on a bed. To get a coat, Satin tells sister she has to crawl. Sister does not think he is serious, so he angrily says it again. Satin then begins to brutally punch Sister. When Sister goes to her next performance, her other sisters realize that she has been beaten by Satin. They encourage her to leave him but she just brushes off the violence as it is no big deal; she believes she can just cover up the bruises with makeup and it will be better.\n\nDarlene Clark Hine's \"A Shining Thread of Hope\" brought up the fact that after women joined the Black Power movements, men felt lesser of themselves as they could not protect and support their families. Hine states that “The Black Power movement reacted to this reality with an extreme emphasis on masculinity and an expectation that women would assume traditional female roles as a way of supporting black manhood. And yet, women in these organizations actually managed to make greater progress in some ways than they had in more traditional civil rights groups” (298). The reading also addresses 1976 as a time when things started to change in regards to sexual harassment being a crime. This all relates to black women and their position of power. “The terrible reality of their oppression by men of their own color […] was personal and political dynamite” (302). Bringing this all together, Satin might have felt dominated by Sister and her success/potential success. It is unfortunate that Sister decides to brush it off but this goes with how she did not want to “light the fuse” of oppression by black men on black women.\n\n\"Blaxploitation films are notable for the ways they frequently situate \"normative\" black male identity amongst a variety of ideological \"others\" (women, homosexuals, other ethnicities) whose presence cannot simply be seen to solidify black manhood.\"\n\nThe 1970s and the Women's Movement provide context for Black films like Sparkle. During this time, Title IX was instated and provided scholarships for female college athletes. In addition, the Equal Rights Amendment of 1972 was a victory for women's suffrage that helped build a dialogue for black women and black women in films.\n\nDrugs, the Mafia, self-determination, and the ghetto are all apparent themes in Sparkle. \nBlack Power in \"Sparkle\" is interesting in that there are no positive black male figures in the film. Every man is using women for things like sex, success, and their own selfish reasons. At one point, Jones even addresses black male sexuality and how they assume the role of a white man to achieve power over women. Going off of this, whites in this film are on the periphery and the focus is on the inner struggle between blacks. An example of this is the relationship between Sister and her boyfriend. Satin is an abusive man towards Sister who is involved with drugs and the Mafia. He is the source for all of Sisters' struggles as he pushes her into doing drugs and making her feel helpless as he beats her time and time again. Delores is an example of self-determination as she sees her sister Sister struggling, which makes her realize that she needs to leave town and do things for herself. She is strong and independent enough to pick everything up and leave town, striving for a decent future. \nAccording to the Senior Vice President of Programming for IFC and Bravo, Frances Berwick, \"Blaxploitation films were some of the most experimental and daring films to come out of both the independent film scene and the studio system, [and] is one of the most ignored and under-appreciated.\" Blaxploitation includes several sub-types, musical being one of them, and where Sparkle fits in.\n\n\"Sparkle\" was domestically released on April 7, 1976 with a running time of 98 minutes. The film was unsuccessful at the box office grossing merely $4 million against a $1 million production budget.\n\nThe film received mostly negative reviews from critics, currently holding a 13% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. \"Variety\" stated that \"somewhere along the line, there was made a decision to cheat—to attempt an honest ghetto drama, but not enough to really go all the way into the characters; to keep the exploitative elements of casual dope and sex, but jump ahead to the convenient tragic results which can be seen on any TV feature; to explore the seedier side of the music business, but not enough to ever get beyond the titillations of pulp storytelling.\" Richard Eder said the film was a predictable sob story but that the main themes of the story are serious enough and credible. Dave Kehr stated that the film was \"[a] hackneyed, ho-hum 1976 feature about a black girl group, clearly modeled on the Supremes.\" FilmFour stated that \"[as] drab as it is, \"Sparkle\"s worth renting for Lonette McKee's performance and the cast renditions of Mayfield's songs. But if you're going to buy anything it should be the soundtrack album.\" However, The Onion's AV Club gave it a B- grade, calling it \"a rags-to-riches story that doesn't miss a stop along the well-trod ghetto-to-musical-charts path, but makes its journey with tuneful conviction.\"\n\nOf the people who appeared in the movie, Irene Cara became the film's breakout star: she went on to record many chart topping singles. Lonette McKee went on to other TV and film appearances with Richard Pryor, including playing Denzel Washington's on screen mother in \"Malcolm X\", and Dorian Harewood and Philip Michael Thomas did more TV and film appearances. Thomas would be famous as Ricardo Tubbs on the TV show \"Miami Vice\".\n\n\"Sparkle\" was previewed by an appreciative audience in Baltimore in March. The crowd of 1300 is said to have applauded, screamed and displayed loud attestation to their feelings that it was a good movie. It was viewed as a rather atypical Blaxploitation film for the day, illustrating \"that based on the nature, dignity, interests and ideals of man even blacks from the ghetto are capable of self-fulfillment and ehtical conduct without recourse to supernaturalism; in this case the super-stud, super-chick theory that is so common in the movies made primarily for the black movie goers today.\"\n\n\"Sparkle\" went on to become a cult-classic among African-American audiences, and was remade in 2012 as a TriStar Pictures release starring Jordin Sparks and Whitney Houston. Directed by Salim and Mara Brock Akil and produced by Stage 6 Films, the film, despite once again receiving mixed to negative reviews, was considered by some to be an improvement over the original. Sparks, Houston, and Mike Epps were all praised individually for their performances. The remake also brought new different aspects to the story which were said to have enhanced the drama of the film. For example, the evil Satin, played by Epps, was turned into a comedian instead of a gangster. Ultimately, the writing and performances were considered captivating and multidimensional. In regards to the music, R. Kelly wrote several new songs which were used alongside the songs composed in the original film by Curtis Mayfield.\n\nThis film was released later than anticipated, due to the sudden death of Houston. Some have considered the film to have been a huge comeback for Houston in the industry, albeit one achieved posthumously. Irene Cara had met Houston a couple of times. She said, \"I remember seeing her mother, Cissy, when I was little, [...] I remember seeing her sing in New York. They were doing a tribute to Burt Bacharach. When Whitney came on to the scene, every time I saw her I saw a little bit of her mother in her.\" Cara expressed a desire to attend the premiere of the film, but was not able due to a recent foot surgery.\n\n\n"}

The company was founded as Parallax Software in June 1993 by Mike Kulas and Matt Toschlog, and developed \"Descent\" and \"Descent II\". The company split in two, wherein Toschlog founded Outrage Entertainment, while Kulas stayed with Parallax, which was renamed Volition in November 1996. Volition was acquired by THQ in August 2000, and when THQ filed for bankruptcy and had its assets sold off, Volition changed hands to Deep Silver in January 2013. Volition is best known for its \"Red Faction\" and \"Saints Row\" series of games.\n\nParallax Software was founded on June 14, 1993, by Mike Kulas and Matt Toschlog. The company was incorporated under the name Parallax Software Corporation. Both founders were programmers who had previously worked together on \"Car and Driver\". This led them to consider launching their own game development company, knowing that, should they fail, they would have to return to working for other's companies. To reach a lower cost-of-living, Toschlog moved from Boston to Champaign, Illinois, where Kulas resided, and the two launched Parallax Software. Early on, they hired programmers John Slagel and Che-Yuan Wang, of which Wang also worked on level design. The team developed a rough concept for a game called \"Inferno\", which they pitched to Apogee Software, the primary publisher of id Software. Apogee began funding the game's development, though the funds did not suffice for the company over time.\n\nBecause the team lacked an artist, Adam Pletcher was hired in January 1994. Shortly thereafter, Apogee dropped the project after it had been in development for seven months, though leaving Parallax with an already funded, functional prototype. Subsequently, while the studio was slowly running out of money, they produced a demo reel of the game and set it as a VHS tape to various publishers. Three companies—Accolade, Trimark Interactive and Interplay Productions (where it was championed by Rusty Buchert)—offered to publish the game, of which Parallax chose Interplay. Jasen Whiteside then became Parallax eighth employee, working on level design while studying industrial design at school. With the studio lacking a quality assurance department, the game was tested by the entire team. As Interplay's funds had also dried up, Parallax refused to ask them for more, not wanting to show signs of weakness. Instead, Kulas and Toschlog invested their own money into the continued development. Funds provided by Apogee, Interplay and the two founders totaled to about . \"Inferno\", now titled \"Descent\", was released in March 1995 to widespread attention.\n\nBy the time Parallax began development on another \"Descent\" game, the team had grown to about 14 people. Interplay wished for the studio to develop a \"CD-enhanced\" version of the game, which would include high-resolution textures, cutscenes and Red Book-quality audio, as well as several new levels. Interplay marketed the game as a new game, \"Descent II\", so they could make more profit than they would have from a simple derivate version of the same game, and could publish a new game under the same contract they had with Parallax. As a result, Parallax profited heavily from \"Descent II\" success.\n\nAlthough Toschlog had moved to Champaign from Boston, he did not want to stay in Champaign long-term. During the development of \"Descent II\", he and three designers moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, to open a second office for Parallax. At the new office, Toschlog also hired two further programmers. After \"Descent II\" had shipped, the team came to the conclusion that working on the same game out of two distant offices had adverse effects on the team, where Toschlog and Kulas agreed to move the company to one office. However, they could not decide on where they should move the company, so they instead opted to split the company in half, a move they were able to pursue due to \"Descent\" success. Thus, half of Parallax' employees followed Toschlog to Michigan, where Toschlog formed Outrage Entertainment, while Kulas stayed with the main Parallax office in Champaign.\n\nAs Kulas' company was to receive a new name, he asked the remaining team for ideas. When he found that he liked none of the proposals, he sat down in his living room, pulling books from a shelf and looking through dictionaries and reference books' glossaries for a possible name. In one such glossary, he found the word \"\", described as \"an intense active will to accomplish something\". As he drew a connection between this definition and the act of software development, he chose \"Volition\" to be the new company name. He pitched the name and its definition to the company's employees, asking them to create a suitable logo. Of the many entries submitted, the one that was chosen was designed by Whiteside and inspired by the logo of Wax Trax! Records, while Pletcher created a font to display the company name with. The logo has been in use since. Formally, Volition was founded in October 1996 with twelve members, and the split was announced on December 1, 1997, with both companies having been organized into new corporate entities (wherein Volition was Volition, Inc.) and wholly owned by their respective leads.\n\nFollowing the split, Volition and Outrage signed with Interplay for two further projects each. Their first project under the new name was \"\" (or simply \"FreeSpace\"), a game that was set to improve on the concepts of games like \"\" and \"\". During the development of \"FreeSpace\", the Volition team doubled in size, adding about five or six people to the studio. During this time many team members were allocated to training the new employees. Meanwhile, Kulas, as the sole manager of the company, had to divide his time between programming and managing the business; consequently, should any business matter come up, his portion of the programming work stood still. \"FreeSpace\" was the last Volition game Kulas would significantly do programming work on. Following the release of \"FreeSpace\", Volition began work on four projects—\"FreeSpace 2\", \"Descent 4\", \"Tube Racer\" and \"Summoner\". The first, \"FreeSpace 2\", was developed within a year. When the game's development had about three months to go, Interplay, who had recently become a public company, urged Volition to complete the game within a month. While the game was completed within the month, Interplay did not adjust their advertisement strategy. As a result, the game sold poorly and was only marginally profitable. \"Tube Racers\" was canceled about six to nine months in development.\n\n\"Descent 4\" was to be the fourth main entry in the \"Descent\" series (the third game, \"Descent 3\", was in development simultaneously at Outrage). As the \"Descent 3\" release date came closer, Interplay began having financial difficulties. When the game launched in June 1999, it also did not sell well. The two companies separated on Volition's suggestion. Interplay owned the publishing rights to the \"Descent\" franchise, and as a result Volition could not publish \"Descent 4\" with a different publisher. Instead, they reused much of the code and tools they had created for the game and used it to create \"Red Faction\".\n\n\"Summoner\", unlike other games by Parallax and Volition, was developed as a role-playing video game, a genre the development team had no experience with. The team were later provided with a development kit for the PlayStation 2, and were tasked with making \"Summoner\" a launch title for the console. Meanwhile, the four-game deal with Interplay was winding down, and Volition required a new publisher for \"Summoner\". On August 31, 2000, they were acquired by THQ, who also overtook the game's publishing duties. In exchange for the ownership of Volition, Volition received one million shares of THQ's common stock and THQ assumed about in net liabilities for Volition's operations. THQ also acquired Outrage in April 2002, though closed that studio by 2004. Following a troubled development cycle, \"Summoner\" eventually hit the intended release date in October 2000, but shipped in a flawed state that resulted from the technical discrepancies between personal computers and PlayStation 2, between which the studio had to port the game.\n\nAfter Volition had started to develop \"Red Faction\" out of what had been \"Descent 4\", many people on the team felt like the game was a \"ground-pounder\", a game they would work hard on just to get an unpleasant result. The game shifted from a space combat game to a first-person shooter with a heavy focus on environmental destruction. Much like \"Summoner\", \"Red Faction\" was first developed for personal computers before moving to consoles. When Kulas attempted to write a part of the game's code, he found himself writing code for personal computers, having to rewrite everything should it work on consoles. The game was delayed for two months shortly before release to allow the team to polish the game before it shipped. The game went gold shortly thereafter, and received positive reviews, much to the surprise of the development team. Following \"Red Faction\", Volition developed \"Summoner II\", aiming at fixing all flaws made in the first game. While it was received better than the first game, it also sold fewer copies. After that came \"Red Faction II\", which was ultimately not reviewed as good as the first game, again to the team's surprise. Internally, \"Red Faction II\" was considered a failure, and the series was halted. Ports of the game, released in 2003, were developed by fellow THQ studios Outrage (Microsoft Windows, Xbox) and Cranky Pants Games (GameCube). A third \"Red Faction\" game was already in development, but was consequently canceled. A third \"Summoner\" game was also canceled. Following these cancellations, their teams started development on a heist-style game called \"Underground\". The team worked on the game for about twelve months, but when \"Grand Theft Auto III\" was released, the marketing department at THQ pushed the expectations for the game so high that they could not be met, wherefore \"Underground\", too, was canceled.\n\nFollowing \"Underground\" cancellation, THQ approached Volition and asked them whether they were willing to create a licensed game. The publisher suggested that they would create a game around Marvel Comics character Punisher, who had a movie coming up, which the studio agreed to. The development team had excursed to Marvel's film studios and were on set, talking to stage designers and witnessing some of the scenes being shot. Meanwhile, in 2003, as the studio grew to 30–40 employees, Kulas hired Dan Cermak as vice-president for the company, who then implemented a new company structure to replace its previous flat hierarchy. As the game neared completion, it was submitted to the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), which, as the game re-enacted the Punisher's violent interrogation methods, deemed the game to be more of a torture simulator than a game. Some elements were adjusted so that the game could pass the ESRB with a \"Mature\" rating.\n\nAt one point, Volition held a design exercise, inviting staff members to submit ideas for a new game. One such idea was a hybrid between a first-person shooter and a \"gang simulator\", a genre unexplored by most games at the time. A trailer was put together by taking snippets from various movies and games, underlaid with the song \"Fuck tha Police\", and after it was showcased in their board room, THQ's chief financial officer stepped forward, stating that this would be a game they were willing to develop. Volition imposed several rules on the game, such as the exclusion of children and the inability to kill the police, so to not generate too much controversy. The team shifted away from developing in wide arrays of genres, instead focusing the entire studio's talent on one design principle: open world. The game, initially known as \"Bling Bling\", was disliked by many of Volition's employees who either did not want to be associated with gang simulator or thought that their work on the game was not worthwhile. The studio faced further trouble as they switched from the PlayStation 2 to the Xbox 360, because the documentation provided with the Xbox 360 was incomplete, and the final hardware specifications for it unknown.\n\nDuring the game's development, the studio overspent its budget of and brought up its headcount to over 100. After the game, now titled \"Saints Row\", was finished, the team was asked to write postmortem documentations, which presented a lot of negative views on the game, as well as criticism with the management. When the game was released and sold well, it was decided that Volition would develop another such game, which would become \"Saints Row 2\". \"Saints Row 2\" differed from its predecessor in that it was more sandbox-oriented and more infused with humor, which the first game almost completely lacked.\n\nKulas had wished to return to developing a game centered around destruction, either through \"Red Faction\" or through a new intellectual property, now that console hardware had been advanced enough to handle such gameplay. Thus, the studio decided to develop a new \"Red Faction\" game, \"\". From the poor reception of \"Red Faction II\", the team had learned that destruction-based gameplay was not a good fit for a shooter set in narrow, enclosed corridors, wherefore the team opted for an open world instead. The game's development cycle lasted roughly five years. While \"Guerrilla\" was set on Mars, the next installment in the franchise, \"\", went in the other direction by being set inside a cave. A third game in the Saints Row franchise, \"Saints Row 3\", was announced in February 2009. The game stripped away many features included in its predecessor to make for a more focused but overall still \"over-the-top\" experience. Under the name \"\", the game was released in November 2011.\n\nIn December 2010, at that year's Spike Video Game Awards, film director Guillermo del Toro took the stage to announce \"Insane\", a horror game developed in partnership with Volition, projecting a 2013 release date. del Toro later revealed that \"Insane\" would become a trilogy, with total development time spanning one decade. However, in August 2012, THQ announced that \"Insane\" had been canceled.\n\nIn April 2011, it was announced that Kulas was retiring from the company, effective on May 2, with Cermak taking over his position as general manager. Following his retirement, he \"goofed off\" for about four years before he got back together with Toschlog, founding a new studio, Revival Productions, in 2014. The new company went to develop a spiritual successor to \"Descent\" named \"Overload\", which was funded through a crowdfunding campaign held on Kickstarter and released in May 2018.\n\nIn December 2012, THQ filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As the publisher's assets were to be sold off, Koch Media offered a bid for Volition. While a total of six groups—Warner Bros., Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive, Ubisoft, Koch Media, and an unnamed group from Chicago—were interested in purchasing the studio, the only other bid submitted was Ubisoft's for . As the sale closed, Volition and the \"Saints Row\" IP were sold to Koch Media for a total of , and became part of its Deep Silver division. As a result, Volition's operations were transitioned into a new legal entity, named Deep Silver Volition, LLC.\n\nSeveral IPs owned by THQ, including Volition's \"Summoner\" and \"Red Faction\", were acquired by Nordic Games (later known as THQ Nordic) for in a second auction held in April. With the purchase of Koch Media by the parent company of Nordic Games (then renamed THQ Nordic) in February 2018, Volition and their IPs were reunited under one company.\n\nA fourth \"Saints Row\" game, \"Saints Row IV\", was released in August 2013. In September 2014, creative director Steve Jaros left Volition to join Valve. An expansion to \"Saints Row IV\", titled \"\" and developed in partnership with High Voltage Software, was released in January 2015.\n\nFollowing \"Saints Row IV\", Volition developed \"Agents of Mayhem\", a game set in the \"Saints Row\" universe, featuring similar gameplay mechanics while being unconnected to the main series. The game released in August 2017 to mixed reviews and poor sales. As a result, about 30 positions, including Cermak, were cut from the studio's previously 200-people-strong workforce. Jim Boone, who had been part of Parallax in 1994, succeeded Cermak as studio development director in October. On December 31, Volition's staff count was 148. In January 2019, Kulas announced his return to Volition as general manager. At the time, Revival Productions was winding down, and when Kulas wondered what to do next, fearing he would end up not doing anything for four years, he decided to re-join the studio after eight years. According to Kulas, his time as an indie developer at Revival helped him \"come up to speed on all kinds of stuff\".\n\nBy August 2019, Volition is \"deep in development\" on a new installment in the \"Saints Row\" franchise. At this time, it had 174 employees, and has close to 200 as of February 2020. In May 2020, Koch Media and THQ Nordic, by this time both part of Embracer Group, exchanged some intellectual property rights, including \"Red Faction\", which was handed to Deep Silver.\n\n"}
{"id": "2174397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174397", "title": "Paper mulberry", "text": "Paper mulberry\n\nThe paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera, syn. \"Morus papyrifera\" L.) is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Asia, where its range includes Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea, Indochina, Burma, and India. It is widely cultivated elsewhere and it grows as an introduced species in parts of Europe, the United States, and Africa. Other common names include tapa cloth tree.\n\nPaper mulberry was used among ancient Austronesians in making barkcloth. It originates from subtropical regions in mainland Asia and is one of the best examples for the mainstream \"Out of Taiwan\" hypothesis of the Austronesian expansion. Various genetic studies have traced the origins of paper mulberry populations in the Remote Pacific all the way to Taiwan via New Guinea and Sulawesi. In the Philippines, which was along the expansion path, paper mulberries are mostly descendants of modern introductions in 1935. Ancient introductions of paper mulberry presumably went extinct in prehistory due to their replacement with hand-woven fabrics, given that paper mulberry generally only survives under human cultivation. However, its absence in the Philippines further underlines its origins in Taiwan, and not within island Southeast Asia. Additionally, paper mulberry populations in New Guinea also show genetic inflow from another expansion out of Indochina and South China.\n\nIt is believed to be the most widely transported fiber crop in prehistory, having been transported along with the full range of the Austronesian expansion, as opposed to most of the other commensal crops in Oceania. Paper mulberry is present in almost every island or island group in Polynesia, including Rapa Nui and Aotearoa. Some populations have gone recently extinct after they stopped being cultivated, such as in the Cook Islands and Mangareva, although accounts and prepared barkcloth and herbarium specimens of them exist in museum collections gathered by Europeans during the colonial era. They were spread by Polynesians primarily through vegetative propagation with cuttings and root shoots. They were rarely cultivated from seeds, as most plants were harvested prior to flowering, when the stems reach around in diameter, as described by 18th-century European accounts. If the feral plants reproduced sexually is unknown, as the plants are dioecious and require both male and female specimens to be present in one island.\n\nThis species is a deciduous shrub or tree usually growing tall, but known to reach at times. The leaves are variable in shape, even on one individual. The blades may be lobed or unlobed, but they usually have toothed edges, lightly hairy, pale undersides, and a rough texture. They are up to about long. The species has male and female flowers on separate plants. The staminate inflorescence is a catkin up to long with fuzzy male flowers. The pistillate inflorescence is a spherical head up to about wide with greenish female flowers trailing long styles. The infructescence is a spherical cluster wide containing many red or orange fruits. Each individual protruding fruit in the cluster is a drupe.\n\nThis plant has been cultivated in Asia and some Pacific Islands for many centuries for food, fiber, and medicine.\n\nPaper mulberry is primarily used in the Pacific Islands to make barkcloth (\"tapa\" in most Polynesian languages). Barkcloth can also be made from other members of the mulberry family (Moraceae), including \"Ficus\" (figs) and \"Artocarpus\". Barkcloth was also occasionally made from \"Pipturus\" nettles, especially in Hawaii. However, the highest quality of barkcloth was from paper mulberry.\n\nBarkcloth was mainly used for clothing among ancient Austronesians and is traditionally made using characteristic stone or wooden beaters, which are among the most common artifacts found in Austronesian archaeological sites. Numerous archaeological remains of barkcloth beaters in southern China have been regarded as evidence that the pre-Taiwan Austronesian homelands were located in the region prior to the southward expansion of the Han Dynasty, particularly around the Pearl River Delta. The oldest such remains are from the Dingmo Site in Guangxi, dated to around 7,900 BP. Barkcloth remained an important source of clothing fabrics in pre-colonial Melanesia, Polynesia, and parts of Indonesia. However, it has been mostly replaced by woven fiber clothing in most of Island Southeast Asia and Micronesia. It is still worn ceremonially in parts of Polynesia and Melanesia. It is also used to make bags and bedding.\n\nAlthough numerous names are used for paper mulberry throughout Austronesia, none are cognates, thus a Proto-Oceanic term cannot be reconstructed. In most of Polynesia, the term for barkcloth can be reconstructed from Proto-Nuclear-Polynesian \"*taba\", meaning \"bark\", with cognates including Wayan \"taba\"; Tongan, Samoan, Mangareva, and Rarotongan \"tapa\"; and Hawaiian \"kapa\". Other terms widely used for barkcloth and paper mulberry are derived from the Proto-Polynesian reconstructed word \"*siapo\", with cognates including Niue, Tongan, and Marquesan \"hiapo\"; and Samoan and East Futunan \"siapo\". The term for barkcloth beater, however, can be reconstructed more extensively back to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian \"*ikay\", with cognates including Uma \"ike\"; Sa'a \"iki\"; Bauan, Tongan, and East Futunan \"ike\"; and Samoan and Hawaiian \"iʻe\".\n\nIt is a significant fiber crop in the history of paper. It was used for papermaking in China by around 100 AD. It was used to make \"washi\" in Japan by 600 AD. \"Washi\", a Japanese handcrafted paper, is made with the inner bark, which is pounded and mixed with water to produce a paste, which is dried into sheets.\n\nThe wood of the plant is useful for making furniture and utensils, and the roots can be used as rope. The fruit and cooked leaves are edible.\n\nThe fruit, leaves, and bark have been used in systems of traditional medicine. For example, the bark and fruit of the species, known locally as \"jangli toot\", are used as a laxative and antipyretic in rural Pakistan.\n\nThe species is used as an ornamental plant. It tolerates disturbance and air pollution, so it has been useful as a landscaping plant on roadsides. It is a pioneer species that easily fills forest clearings, and it has been considered for reforestation efforts. It grows well in many climate types.\n\nThe ability of the plant to readily colonize available habitat, particularly disturbed areas, has helped it become an invasive species in some regions. It spreads rapidly when male and female individuals grow together and seeds are produced. Seed dispersal is accomplished by animals that eat the fruits, and the plants can form wide, dense stands via their spreading root systems.\n\nThis is considered to be one of the worst weeds in Pakistan, one of the most significant invasive plants on the Pampas in Argentina, and a dominant invasive in the forests of Uganda.\n\nThe pollen is allergenic. It is reportedly a main culprit of inhalant allergy in Islamabad, where the species is a very common urban weed. The pollen allergy and asthma caused by this plant sends thousands of patients to hospitals in Islamabad during March. The species should not be taken to other areas without due consideration of the potential of male plants to shed their injurious pollen.\n\n\n"}

It is planned to have a length of with 9 lines once all construction is complete by 2025.\n\nOn all days of the week, the Metro service runs from approximately 05:30 to 23:00.\n\nThe line uses standard gauge and is mostly underground. Ticket price is 1000 Iranian Toman for each journey (about US$0.25), regardless of the distance traveled, but using prepaid tickets costs much less. Seniors may travel for free on the metro. On all Tehran metro trains the first and half of the second carriages from each end are reserved for women. Women can still ride other cars freely.\n\nInitial plans for the metro system were laid in late 1960s but could not be executed until 1982 due to socio-political issues such as the Iranian Revolution and the Iran-Iraq war. In 1970 the Plan and Budget Organization and the Municipality of Tehran announced an international tender for construction of a metro in Tehran. The French company SOFRETU, affiliated with the state-owned Paris transportation authority RATP, won the tender and in the same year began to conduct preliminary studies on the project. In 1974 a final report with a so-called \"street-metro\" proposal was tendered. The street-metro system recommended a road network with a loop express way in the central area and two highways for new urban areas and an 8-line metro network which were complemented by bus network and taxi services. Geological surveys commenced in 1976. In 1978 construction on the line was started in northern Tehran by the French company, however this development was short-lived with the advent of the Iranian Revolution and Iran–Iraq War in 1979 and 1980 respectively. SOFRETU ceased operations in Iran in December 1980. On March 3, 1982, the Iranian Cabinet ministers formally announced the stop of Tehran Metro operations by the French company.\nIn 1985, the \"Tehran Metro Execution Plan\" was re-approved by the \"Majles\", the Iranian Parliament, on the basis of legal project of \"Amendment of Law of Establishment of Tehran Urban and suburban Railway Company\" which had been founded on Farvardin 1364 (April 1985). This was a literal continuation of exactly the same project that had been laid out before the revolution. Work proceeded slowly due to the continuing Iran–Iraq War and often ground to a halt. By the summer of 1985, urban pressure from the rapidly urbanising population, and lack of developed public transport system prompted the work to be resumed in earnest. \"Line 1\" (From Blvd. Shahid Ayatollah Haghani to City of Rey) and its extension to Behesht-e-Zahra Cemetery was made a priority. \"Line 2\" (From Dardasht in Tehran Pars district to Sadeghiyeh Second Square) and an extending towards the City of Karaj and Mehrshahr district was also made a secondary priority. Studies were also made to establish the previously designed Lines 3 & 4. It was decided that an organisation by the name of the Metro Company should be established in order to handle the future development of the system.\n\nFollowing this phase, the Metro Company was managed by Asghar Ebrahimi Asl for eleven years. During this time, hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on the system and the Metro Company was given government concessions for the exploitation of iron ore mines in Bandar Abbas (Hormuzgan Province), exploitation and sale of Moghan Diotomite mine in the Iranian region of Azarbaijan, export of refinery residues from Isfahan oil refinery as well as tar from Isfahan steel mill . The year after Asghar Ebrahimi Asl left the management of the Metro Company and Mohsen Hashemi succeeded him, the first line of the Tehran Metro was launched between Tehran and Karaj.\n\nOn 7 March 1999, an overland Tehran-Karaj express electric train started a limited service of between Azadi Square (Tehran) and Malard (Karaj) calling at one intermediate station at Vardavard. The line was constructed by the Chinese company NORINCO.\n\nLine 5 of the Tehran metro began operating in 1999 and was Iran's first metro system.\nFrom 2000 onwards, commercial operation began on Lines 1 and 2. The wagons on these lines are provided by CRV via CNTIC. The railway tracks and points on these lines are provided by the Austrian company Voestalpine.\n\nThe Metro uses equipment manufactured by a wide range of international companies: double-deck passenger cars for the Tehran-Karaj regional line are supplied by CRV (although some trains are from SEGC) via CNTIC and assembled by the Wagon Pars factory in Arak.\n\nA branch line of Line 4 began running to Mehrabad International Airport on 15 March 2016. A express line to Imam Khomeini International Airport was opened on August 2017.\n\nLine 1, coloured red on system maps, is long, of which are underground (from Tajrish station to Shoush-Khayyam crossing) and the rest runs at surface level. There are 29 stations along this line of which 22 stations are located underground and 7 above ground. , the total capacity of line 1 is 650,000 passenger per day, with trains stopping at each station for 20 seconds. The trains are each made up of seven wagons, with a nominal capacity of 1,300 seated and standing passengers. The maximum speed of the trains is which is tempered to an average of due to stoppages at stations along the route.\n\nLine 1 runs mostly north–south. A , three station extension of the line from Mirdamad station to Qolhak station opened on May 20, 2009. The , four stations second phase of this extension from Qolhak station to Tajrish Square was completed in 2011. Construction was to be completed by March 2007 but faced major issues due to large boulders and rock bed in part of the tunnels as well as water drainage issues. It has also faced major financing issues as the government has refused to release funds earmarked for the project to the municipality.\n\nSince August 2017, one of Line 1's stations, Darvazeh Dowlat is open 24 hours a day, in order to accommodate passengers traveling to and from Imam Khomeini Airport via Line 1.\n\nLine 1 connects Tehran to Imam Khomeini International Airport. Its first phase, to Shahr-e-Aftab station, opened in 2016, and the airport station opened in August 2017. It is the only metro line in Tehran that is completely open 24 hours a day (even if the frequency is only 80 minutes...), in order to accommodate passengers from late night and early morning flights (Line 1's Darvazeh Dowlat station is the only other metro station outside of Line 1 with that classification).<ref name=\"Financial Tribune-People-24/7 Subways\"></ref> A third phase, which is currently under construction, will extend Line 1 to the satellite city of Parand and bring the total length of the line to . Its per hour speeds classify it as an express subway line, the first of its kind on the Tehran Metro.\n\nThis line opened between Sadeghieh and Imam Khomeini in February 2000. Line 2 is long, with underground and elevated. There are 22 stations along the line, of which Imam Khomeini Station was shared by Line 1. Line 2 is coloured blue on system maps and runs mostly east–west through the city.\n\nThe line was extended from Imam-Khomeini to Baharestan Metro Station in 2004, and to Shahid Madani, Sarsabz and Elm-o-Sanat University in March 2006 with the intermediate stations, Darvazeh Shemiran and Sabalan, opening in July 2006. It was extended further from Elm-o-Sanat University to Tehran Pars in February 2009, and to Farhangsara in June 2010. The extension phase to new east terminal is under construction.\n\nLine 3 travels from northeast to southwest. Line 3 is one of the most important lines as it connects southwest Tehran to northeast, crosses busy parts of the capital city, and can help to alleviate traffic problems. About of Line 3 became operational in December 2012, followed by in April 2014, and finally, the last section of the line which is opened on September 22, 2015, increasing the length of the line to a total of , and serving 15 stations .\n\nThe line is long with 18 stations. which connects the western part of Tehran to eastern part. This line initially runs through Ekbatan (western Tehran) to Kolahdooz (eastern Tehran). The construction of a western extension to line 4 has been started in 2012 connecting Ekbatan to Chaharbagh Sq. This extension included 3 stations. A sub-line of this line connects Bimeh station to Mehrabad Airport. This sub-line has 2 stations at Terminal 1&2 and Terminal 4&6.\n\nSection 1, from Ferdowsi Square to Darvazeh Shemiran, opened in April 2008. Section 2 from Darvazeh shemiran to Shohada Square opened in February 2009. On May 24, 2009, Section 3 from Ferdowsi Square to Enghelab Square opened. On July 23, 2012 two more stations were inaugurated, connecting line 4 with line 5.\n\nCurrently there are 19 stations in operation on Line 4, coloured yellow on the system maps.\n\nLine 5 is coloured green on system maps; it is a commuter rail line and has 11 stations. Entering the area of Karaj with main stations at Karaj and Golshahr. It connects with the western end of Line 2 at Tehran (Sadeghiyeh) station, and with the western end of Line 4 at Eram-e Sabz Metro Station.\n\nThis line is coloured pink on system maps; it is a with a first section from Shohada Square to Dowlat Abad were opened on April 7, 2019. When completed this line is long with 3 stations as it connects southeast Tehran to northwest. A tunnel boring machine (TBM) is used to construct the tunnel. TBM is using earth pressure balanced method to pass safely through urban areas without considerable settlement.\n\nThis line, similar to line 6, and in contrast with line 3, goes from northwest to southeast and was constructed with modern TBM machines. Its first phase, compromising of of line and 7 stations were opened in June 2017. This line have with 10 station right now.\n\n 3 LRT (Tram) lines are proposed along with the Metro lines.\n\n3 other commuter Rail lines are planned along with Line 5(Tehran-Karaj-Hashtgerd Commuter Rail) bringing the total Metro Commuter Rails to 4 Lines .\n\n\nAll routes have been equipped with automatic train protection (ATP), automatic train stop (ATS), centralized traffic control (CTC), and SCADA. More and more residents use the metro due to the improvement in the peak-hour headways, the opening of more stations and overall improvement with new escalators, elevators, and air-conditioning in the trains.\n\nOn 18 July 2007, a twenty square metres area immediately adjacent to the entrance of the Toupkhaneh metro station caved in. There were no casualties, but the station had to undergo numerous repairs.\nOn 15 April 2012, safety walls of Mianrood River broke due to heavy rain in Tehran, and consequently, 300,000 cubic meters of water entered metro tunnel of Line 4. The two nearest stations were still under construction, so Metro operators had enough time to evacuate other stations from passengers. Nobody was killed, but water depth in the Habib-o-llah station, the deepest station on Line 4, was estimated to be near 18 meters. It took nearly two weeks to reopen the flooded stations which were previously in operation.\n\nThe Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran has complained that the vibrations caused by the Metro were having a significant and highly adverse effect on the Masoudieh Palace in the Baharestan neighbourhood of central Tehran. The Cultural Heritage Organisation has also complained about vibrations near other historic sites such as the Golestan Palace and the National Museum of Iran. However, engineers and technical experts believe that it is the noise that induces the false sense of vibration and like many metro systems in large cities, no untoward impact is probable.\n\nAnother major complaint is the lack of a transfer station between lines 2 and 3, this has passengers having to transfer to line 4, travel a few stations along this highly congested line, and transfer again.\n\nRegular single table tickets\n\nYou can only use the subway once with this ticket. This ticket costs 12,000 Rials. Of course, if you plan to take a round trip, you need to get two single tickets.\n\nSuburban single table tickets\n\nThis is the ticket from the 5th metro line that reaches Sadeghieh station from Karaj station. This ticket costs 12,000 Rials.\n\nInternational Airport Single Ticket\n\nThis ticket is used for the subway line of Imam Khomeini Airport. This ticket costs 90,000 Rials.\n\nElectronic ticket\n\nYou can use the subway as many times as you want by charging it. The cost of each of these e-cards is 30,000 Rials or 50,000 Rials and you can charge up to 500,000 Rials after purchase. You can charge your e-card using various booths and wall-mounted electronic charging devices at the bus and subway stations, either by cash or by bank credit card.\n\n"}

{"id": "2174408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174408", "title": "Belted plaid", "text": "Belted plaid\n\nThe belted plaid (or a plaid worn belted) is a large blanket-like piece of fabric which is wrapped around the body with the material pleated or, more accurately, loosely gathered and secured at the waist by means of a belt. Typically, a portion of the belted plaid hangs down to about the knees (for men) or ankles (for women) with the rest of the material being wrapped up around the upper body in a variety of ways and pinned or otherwise secured to keep it in place.\n\nThe belted plaid was a standard item of men's Highland dress from the late 16th century until the middle of the 18th century. It was also the precursor of the modern tailored kilt.\n\nThe word \"plaide\" in Gaelic roughly means blanket, and that was the original term for the garment. The belted plaid has been and is often referred to by a variety of different terms, including \"féileadh-mór\", \"breacan an fhéilidh\", and very commonly, the \"Great Kilt\", however the garment was most definitely \"not\" known by the name \"Great Kilt\" during the years when it was in common use.\n\nBoth the terms \"féileadh-mór\" and \"breacan an fhéilidh\" are Gaelic terms, the former meaning roughly \"large wrap\" and the latter roughly meaning \"tartan wrap\". Women's ankle-length belted plaids are called \"earasaidean\".\n\nThe belted plaid consisted of a piece of tartan fabric approximately in length and about wide. Since the weaving looms in those years wove fabric in widths, the actual item was generally constructed from of such single-width fabric by stitching two pieces together to get the width.\n\nIt was typically worn as a kind of mantle or cloak cast about the shoulders. In the latter part of the 16th century, some in the Highlands of Scotland began putting a belt around their waist on the outside of the plaid, after first pleating or gathering the fabric.\n\nThe first clear reference to the belted plaid occurs in the year 1594. In that year, a group of Highlanders from the Western Isles went to Ireland to fight under Red Hugh O'Donnell. Writing about them, Lughaidh noted how they could be distinguished from the Irish soldiers:\n\"They were recognized among the Irish soldiers by the distinction of their arms and clothing ... for their exterior dress was mottled cloaks of many colours ..., their belts were over their loins outside their cloaks.\"\n\nA surviving woman's plaid dated 1726 exists (reconstruction, displayed worn as an earasaid). \n\nA surviving men's belted plaid from 1822 has a horizontal seam and small belt loops sewn across it at each pattern repeat, such that it could be rapidly pleated with a drawstring, or flattened entirely into a blanket.\n\nThe belted plaid was made from wool or a wool / linen combination and twill, often woven in a pattern of coloured stripes in one or both directions. This gave a pattern of stripes or checks. The latter has today become known as tartan, though originally the word tartan referred to the type of cloth used, and not the pattern of colours, as the word almost exclusively signifies today.\n\nThese tartan patterns (or Setts) were apparently chosen based on a sense of fashion or the availability and expense of natural dyes in the area of manufacture. The modern notion of \"clan tartans\" whereby each clan or name is associated with a particular design did not exist at that time, but instead dates back to the early 19th century.\n\nThe belted plaid was used not only as a garment, but also as bedding at night, the wearer wrapping himself in it and sleeping directly on the ground.\n\nDuring the years preceding the Battle of Culloden, to the extent that Highlanders wore any kind of kilt-like garment, it was the belted plaid and not the modern tailored kilt. \n\nAt nearly every Highland Games gathering there are vendors selling tartan items, whether tailored kilts, blankets, scarves, ties, or tartan fabric. By far the greatest proportion of their sales in the category of Highland dress are related to \"modern\" Highland attire, especially the modern tailored kilt and its accessories. Yet the belted plaid is seldom seen today at gatherings of highlanders, and even knowledge of this garment is not widespread.\n\nThe \"present-day\" Highland Games trace their origins back to the early 19th century interest in matters related to Highland culture. This interest manifested itself in various reconstructionist events purportedly designed as a celebration of that earlier Gaelic Highland and Celtic culture, but such cultures never wore garments like the modern tailored kilt.\n\nThe modern short kilt is called \"féileadh beag\" (\"little wrap\"), and often Anglicized to philabeg or filibeg, with various spellings. Its origins are still debated; what is clear is that the philabeg developed from the belted plaid sometime in the early 18th century, or perhaps somewhat earlier. The philabeg consisted essentially of the lower half of a plaid, gathered or pleated and held around the waist with a belt. Later, the gatherings were stitched down to hold them in place, and thus originated the modern tailored kilt.\n\nSome speculate the modern \"sport / half-plaid kilt\" was derived from miners, or fashion, due to it being half the cost of a full belted plaid, whereupon one can choose either a fly plaid or not. This would have helped at the Battle of the Shirts.\n\n\n"}

He was largely self-taught as a composer, and belongs to the figures of the English Musical Renaissance.\n\nA successful composer of light music and theatre scores, his principal creative energies went into more ambitious and exploratory works that were particularly influenced by Indian music. Suffering a setback after the decline in popularity of his \"World Requiem\" (1919–1921), he left London for Paris in 1927, and eventually travelled to India in 1935 where, among other things, he collected folk music, composed pieces for traditional Indian instrument ensembles, and worked for a radio station.\n\nFoulds was an adventurous figure of great innate musicality and superb technical skill. Among his best works are \"Three Mantras\" for orchestra and wordless chorus (1919–1930), \"Essays in the Modes\" for piano (1920–1927), the piano concerto \"Dynamic Triptych\" (1927–1929), and his ninth string quartet \"Quartetto Intimo\" (1931–1932).\n\nJohn Foulds was born in Hulme, Manchester, England, on 2 November 1880, the son of a bassoonist in the Hallé Orchestra. Prolific from childhood, Foulds himself joined the Hallé as a cellist in 1900, having already served an apprenticeship in theatre and promenade orchestras in England and abroad. Hans Richter gave him conducting experience; Henry Wood took up some of his works, starting with \"Epithalamium\" at the 1906 Queen's Hall Proms. Foulds was Jewish.\n\nIn some respects ahead of his time (he started using quarter-tones as early as the 1890s, while some of his later works anticipate Messiaen and Minimalism), Foulds was in others an intensely practical musician. He became a successful composer of light music – his \"Keltic Lament\" was once a popular favourite and in the 1920s the BBC scheduled his music on a daily basis. This was a source of irritation to Foulds; in 1933 he complained to Adrian Boult at the BBC that his serious music was not being performed: \"[My light works] number a dozen or so, as compared with the total of 50 of my serious works. This state of affairs is rather a galling one for a serious artist.\" Foulds also wrote many effective theatre scores, notably for his friends Lewis Casson and Sybil Thorndike. Perhaps the best known was the music for the first production of George Bernard Shaw's \"Saint Joan\" (Foulds conducted a Suite from it at the Queen's Hall Proms in 1925). He also wrote the score for Casson's highly successful West End production of Shakespeare's \"Henry VIII\", which ran from December 1925 to March 1926. However, his principal creative energies went into more ambitious and exploratory works, often coloured by his interest in the music of the East, especially India.\n\nFoulds moved to London before World War I, and in 1915 during the war he met the violinist Maud MacCarthy, one of the leading Western authorities on Indian music. His gigantic \"World Requiem\" (1919–1921), in memory of the dead of all nations, was performed at the Royal Albert Hall, conducted by Foulds, under the auspices of The Royal British Legion on Armistice Night, 11 November, in 1923 by up to 1,250 instrumentalists and singers; the latter were called the Cenotaph choir. Performances in 1924 and 1925 took place at the Queen's Hall. In 1926 it returned to the Albert Hall, but this was to be the last performance until 2007, again at the Albert Hall. The performances in 1923–26 constituted the first Festivals of Remembrance. While some critics were not impressed by the work, it was nonetheless popular. One newspaper wrote: \"The scope of the work is beyond what anyone has dared to attempt hitherto. It is no less than to find expression for the deepest and most widespread unhappiness this generation has ever known. As such it was received by a very large number of listeners, who evidently felt that music alone could do this for them.\" However, the work ceased to be performed after 1926. Some commentators have suggested a conspiracy against Foulds – his biographer Malcolm MacDonald has, for instance, implied some sort of \"intrigue\". It appears Foulds was regarded as an inappropriate composer for the occasion because he had not fought in the war, or because of his suspected Left-wing views.\n\nWhen interest in the \"World Requiem\" lapsed, Foulds suffered a grave setback and in 1927 left for Paris, working there as an accompanist for silent films. Here, he was acquainted with the Irish-American composer Swan Hennessy with whom he shared an interest in musical Celticism. In 1934 he published a book on contemporary musical developments, \"Music To-day\". In 1935 he travelled to India, where he collected folk music, became Director of European Music for All-India Radio in Delhi, created an orchestra from scratch, and began to work towards his dream of a musical synthesis of East and West, actually composing pieces for ensembles of traditional Indian instruments. He was so successful that he was asked to open a branch of the station in Calcutta. Tragically, within a week of arriving there, he died suddenly of cholera on 25 April 1939.\n\nFoulds' most substantial compositions include string quartets, symphonic poems, concertos, piano pieces and a huge \"concert opera\" on Dante's \"The Divine Comedy\" (1905–1908), as well as a series of \"Music-Pictures\" exploring the affinities between music and styles of painting. (Henry Wood introduced one of them at the 1913 Proms.) Few of these works were performed and fewer published in his lifetime, and several, especially from his last period in India, are lost. (The missing scores included a \"Symphony of East and West\" for Oriental instruments and Western symphony orchestra.) Foulds' daughter deposited some of the surviving manuscripts by her father in the British Library.\n\nFoulds became a footnote to English music after his death, but from 1974 Malcolm MacDonald, editor of the music journal \"Tempo\" under the alias Calum MacDonald, conducted an often lonely campaign for Foulds after he came across the Foulds scores deposited in the British Library. MacDonald tracked down Foulds' daughter, who took him to a garage and showed him two coffin-sized boxes full of sketches and manuscripts she had been left by her mother. Unfortunately, many of the manuscripts were damaged: apparently, rats and ants had got at them while they were in India, where Foulds' wife stayed after his death.\n\nAn acclaimed recording of Foulds' string quartet music, including the previously unperformed \"Quartetto Intimo\", by the Endellion Quartet in the early 1980s, began to reawaken interest in him, and this was sustained in the early 1990s by Lyrita Recorded Edition's decision to issue some of Foulds' works including \"Three Mantras\" and \"Dynamic Triptych\" on CD. A Proms performance of \"Three Mantras\" in 1998 was well received, and soon after the Finnish conductor Sakari Oramo began to champion Foulds' work in concerts with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO), to huge critical acclaim. In November 2005, the CBSO, with Peter Donohoe, gave the first live performance for more than 70 years of Foulds' piano concerto, the \"Dynamic Triptych\" (1927–1929). The orchestra has issued two well-received CDs of Foulds' music. On Armistice Night, 11 November 2007, the Royal Albert Hall staged the first performance for 81 years of the \"World Requiem\" under the auspices of the BBC, with the Trinity Boys Choir and Leon Botstein as conductor. The performance was recorded live and released in Super Audio CD format by Chandos Records in January 2008.\n\nFoulds' \"Keltic Lament\" has once again become popular due to its regular playing on Classic FM, and BBC Radio 3 plans to revive a tradition of performing \"A World Requiem\" on Armistice Day.\n\nJohn Foulds was only 21 when he married librarian Dora Woodcock in 1902.

She has been a member of That Dog, Tito & Tarantula, and The Decemberists; has contributed to recordings by Bill Frisell, The Twilight Singers, Beck, Mike Watt, Luscious Jackson, Foo Fighters, Green Day, Weezer, The Rentals, Victoria Williams, Yuka Honda, The Gutter Twins, Sunn O))), and Cornelius. She is the daughter of the jazz bassist Charlie Haden; the triplet sister of bassist Rachel Haden (her bandmate in That Dog) and cellist Tanya Haden (married to singer and actor Jack Black) with whom she has performed as The Haden Triplets; and the sister of bassist-singer Josh Haden, leader of the group Spain.\n\nIn New York City, in 1996 she released her first album, \"Imaginaryland\", consisting mostly of original a cappella music. In 2000, Petra was struck by a car while crossing a street in Los Angeles; the resulting injuries forced her out of performance for several months. In 2005 she released the home-recorded album \"\" (Bar/None), a complete a cappella rendition of \"The Who Sell Out.\" The project was suggested to Haden by longtime friend Mike Watt, who also gave her the eight-channel multi-track cassette recorder she used to make it. Funded in part by a Durfee grant and wanting to perform the work live, Haden created a new arrangement of \"The Who Sell Out\" for a ten-woman a cappella choir called Petra Haden & The Sellouts. The premiere live performance of the full work occurred in July 2005 at the Ford Amphitheatre as a part of the \"sound.\" concert series.\n\nShe has also released a self-titled collaboration with jazz guitarist Bill Frisell.\n\nShe contributed to the recording of \"ØØ Void\" by drone metal band Sunn O))) and played on the debut and follow up album of Sunn O))) guitarist Greg Anderson's other doom metal band Goatsnake. The Haden Triplets sang the part of the Fates in Anaïs Mitchell's 2010 release \"Hadestown\" on Righteous Babe Records.\n\nShe is also at work on a collection of songs with Yuka Honda, apparently with contributing performances by Sean Lennon.\n\nIn 2007, Haden recorded an a cappella cover of Journey's \"Don't Stop Believin'\" for the compilation album \"Guilt by Association Vol. 1\". This arrangement of the song is very similar to that used in the \"Glee\" version of the song in 2009.\n\nShe performed on the soundtrack to the film \"An American Crime\", starring Catherine Keener and Ellen Page, which premiered on Showtime in May 2008.\n\nIn 2009, Toyota commissioned Haden to perform three songs for television commercials for the third-generation Toyota Prius, including an a cappella version of the Bellamy Brothers 1970s song \"Let Your Love Flow\" and worked as an arranger and vocal coach on The Sing Off on NBC, alongside Deke Sharon.\n\nHaden played violin on \"Sentimental Tune\" by Tegan and Sara, off of their album \"Sainthood\" (released October 27, 2009).\n\nIn 2011, Haden formed the group If By Yes with Yuka Honda, the culmination of an eight-year songwriting collaboration. The band released one album, \"Salt on Sea Glass\" Other band members included Yuko Araki on drums and Hirotaka “Shimmy” Shimizu on guitar, with contributions from David Byrne and Nels Cline.\n\nIn 2014 she worked on a collaboration with Jim Bianco in Hooray Matinee. The resulting tracks were released on a number of digital outlets.\n\nIn 2015, she provided vocals for the rock mockumentary \"Gentle & Soft: The Blue Jean Committee Story\", the 1st season finale of the IFC series \"Documentary Now!\" (starring Fred Armisen & Bill Hader).

It focused on artists that are generally outside the metal mainstream, and occasionally covers other forms of extreme music as well. Online since August 1995, \"Chronicles of Chaos\" was one of the first webzines in the world for that genre of music. It was a nonprofit publication since its inception. \"Chronicles of Chaos\" stopped publishing new articles in August 2015.\n\n\"Chronicles of Chaos\" was founded by Canadians Gino Filicetti and Adrian Bromley in 1995, and started out in the shape of a monthly e-mail digest.\n\nIn its early years, \"CoC\" was one of the few to publish reviews and interviews on the Internet featuring bands such as Eyehategod, Nevermore, Strapping Young Lad and Dimmu Borgir before they were well known, as well as numerous other bands that were popular in the mid-1990s metal underground, including At the Gates, Fear Factory, Dismember, Dissection, Brutal Truth, Napalm Death, Sepultura, Hypocrisy, My Dying Bride, Type O Negative, Cannibal Corpse, Edge of Sanity, Paradise Lost, Amorphis, Morbid Angel, In Flames, Sentenced, Therion, Emperor, Vader, Grimlord, Bolt Thrower, Opeth and Slayer, among others. CoC also interviewed the leaders of labels such as Earache Records, Peaceville and The End Records.\n\nInitially composed of four contributors from Canada and the USA in 1995, the staff eventually reached a stable set of nine writers in 1997, including the first European contributor. Near the year 2000, the European contingent was expanded by three new writers, with representatives from the Asian and African continents joining shortly after. This led to a core staff of twelve writers in 2002.\n\nIn this period, founder Filicetti retired from his role as contributor, while co-founder Bromley moved on to form his own print publication, \"Unrestrained!\", with fellow \"CoC\" contributor Adam Wasylyk. Meanwhile, various other writers departed or became part-time contributors due to other engagements. Some of \"Chronicles of Chaos\"' writing staff became contributors to magazines like \"Metal Hammer\", \"Terrorizer\", \"Unrestrained!\" and more. As a result, the e-mail issues became less regular, with as much as three month gaps.\n\nBetween October 2002 and March 2003 the publication went on an unofficial hiatus for the only time in its history. Until 2003, the \"Chronicles of Chaos\" website served only as a static repository of plain text back issues, with the latest digest available for hypertext navigation.\n\nFrom 2003 onwards, the publication adopted a database-driven website. Older articles previously found only inside plain text files became immediately accessible, and the new system also allowed articles to be published more frequently and directly to the website. The e-mail digest returned to its original monthly schedule, gathering up the articles published on the website during that month. More than 100 issues of the e-mail digest were published until 2011, containing over 20 megabytes of text.\n\nThe staff was gradually augmented between 2003 and 2008 with the addition of new European, American and Australian writers. This led to a total of around twenty writers, although several of those were only sporadic part-time contributors who were previously an integral part of the publication pre-2003. In keeping with its international tradition, over a dozen different nationalities were represented in the staff.\n\nIn 2007, \"Chronicles of Chaos\" was mentioned by sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris in his book on extreme metal.\n\nOn December 7, 2008, \"Chronicles of Chaos\" co-founder Adrian Bromley died due to pneumonia, in his sleep, aged 37. His passing prompted numerous tributes within the music industry.\n\nOn August 12, 2015, marking the twentieth anniversary of the magazine, founder Gino Filicetti and co-editor Pedro Azevedo announced that \"Chronicles of Chaos\" had ceased publication of new articles. The reasons for this decision included much increased public access to streaming and downloading albums, as well as a dearth of new writers. The announcement was coupled with opinion articles from several of CoC's current and former writers.\n\n\"Chronicles of Chaos\" remains online as an archive, containing over 7,500 reviews, interviews and opinion articles that were published during a span of twenty years.\n\n"}

Members included Lawrence (Larry) Newkirk, Froilan (Vito) Ramirez, and Michael Harris. Lawrence brought Leroy Burgess into the group and shortly thereafter, Stuart Bascombe was asked to join. They were now a group of five teenagers. They all went to meet with musician Patrick Adams and his partner, Al Avant Sr., who began to train and develop the group. Michael stepped away to pursue his education. Sometime after, Larry and Vito left the group to pursue their education as well, leaving just Leroy and Stuart. In 1969, Russell Patterson was asked to join, and they became the trio we know as Black Ivory.\n\nThe group features songwriter and prolific disco producer Leroy Burgess, Stuart Bascombe, and Russell Patterson. They were managed by Patrick Adams, an executive at the Today/Perception record company. Burgess was the lead voice of the majority of their hits in the early 1970s. Their 1972 debut album, \"Don't Turn Around\", became a top 20 hit spending 19 weeks on Billboards R&B Album Chart, and peaked at #13. With Today/Perception being a small label, the promotion of Black Ivory's singles scarcely got beyond the East Coast. This lack of exposure, coupled with the rise of disco and the fact Adams was beginning to branch out into other projects, caused Black Ivory to lose steam.\n\nEarly in their career, Black Ivory's songs were covered by other artists on Today/Perception, a common practice with the label. Label-mates J.J. Barnes, The Eight Minutes, Debbie Taylor, and Lucky Peterson all covered Black Ivory tunes.\n\nThe group recorded several uptempo songs in the disco vein, such as \"Big Apple Rock,\" \"Walking Downtown (On A Saturday Night)\", \"What Goes Around (Comes Around)\" and, later, \"Mainline\" but, not being known for the style, they were unable to compete when disco became the dominant music style. While he was with Black Ivory, Burgess frequently collaborated with Adams in writing songs. He also wrote the groups' hit, \"Mainline,\" which featured Russell Patterson on lead and was recorded while he was on hiatus from the group.\n\nIn 1995 the group has reunited and returned to the stage on the Classic Soul circuit, featuring all three original members, with Stuart Bascombe doing most of the leads. They have been performing and recording together ever since, releasing a Christmas single entitled \"Snow\", and In November 2011, they released a new CD entitled \"Continuum\".\n\nBlack Ivory are one of the featured artist in the award winning 2018 documentary, \"Mr. Soul!\", a film based on the host and executive producer of SOUL!, Ellis Haizlip, the first “black Tonight Show.” In 1968, SOUL! was launched as a local, New York broadcast. In 1969 the series rolled out nationwide on PBS, on WNET Channel 13. Haizlip had produced over 130 hour-long shows featuring a dazzling array of A-list guests.\n\nLeroy Burgess and Stuart Bascombe were contributing writers on the single, \"Gettin Up\" on Rapper and Musician Q-Tip's nominated Best Rap Album of The Year, \"The Renaissance\", at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. Rapper Eminem won Best Rap Album of The Year for \"Relapse\".\n\nBlack Ivory are founding members of The National Rhythm and Blues Music Society Inc. They were awarded the National R&B Music Society's Legend Award to commemorate their 50th Anniversary on September 18, 2019.\n\nBlack Ivory celebrated their 50th Anniversary in 2019 in the music industry. They received multiple awards and proclamations through-out 2019 commemorating their milestone including a 13 page article in the London magazine, The Soul Survivors. They performed and received awards at London’s Famous Jazz Cafe on October 19, 2019.\n\nAs of 2020, Black Ivory are one of the only Classic Soul/R&B Group of the 70's who are still performing with all of the original members from their first recordings.\n\nIn recent years, some of Black Ivory's work has been sampled by a number of artists. Raekwon sampled \"I Keep Asking You Questions\" for his song Criminology on his acclaimed 1995 album, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. He also sampled the same song in 2005 for his single, \"Criminology 2.5\", that featured Ghostface Killah and Method Man, from the album, \"Wu-Massacre\".\n\nE.U., Washington, D.C.-based go-go/funk band covered, \"Don't Turn Around\" on their 1989 on his album, \"Livin' Large\".\n\nIn 2000, Barbara Tucker reached number one on the Billboard dance chart with her single, \"Stop Playing with My Mind\", which sampled \"Mainline.\" \n\nIn 2002 Rapper Nas sampled, \"We Made It\", for his song, \"Revolutionary Warfare\" from his top charting Platinum R&B album, \"God's Son\".\n\nBrother Ali in 2004 sampled, \"It's Time to Say Goodbye\" on his track \"Love On Display\" from his Champion EP. \n\nIn his 2006 Beat Konducta Vol.1-2: Movie Scenes, Madlib sampled \"You and I\" in his beat titled \"The Understanding (Comprehension)\". \n\nQ-Tip sampled, \"You and I\" on his hit single, \"Gettin'Up\" from his 2008 Grammy nominated Best Rap Album The Renaissance\n\nLil B sampled \"Surrender\" for his track \"Surrender To Me\" on the White Flame mixtape.\n\nIn 2005, Omarion sampled \"Don't Turn Around\" on the remix of his song \"I'm Gonna Try (Pt. 2)\". \n\n9th Wonder sampled \"Love Won't You Stay\" on Kaze's \"For The Record\", and he sampled \"Warm Inside\" on JustMyThoughtsSoul!!!! from the album, Tutankhamen (Valley of the Kings).\n\nRapper Mac Miller sampled, \"Warm Inside\" for his single \"Outside\", on the mix tape, K.I.D.S.

{"id": "2174437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174437", "title": "Eisriesenwelt", "text": "Eisriesenwelt\n\nThe Eisriesenwelt (German for \"World of the Ice Giants\") is a natural limestone and ice cave located in Werfen, Austria, about 40 km south of Salzburg. The cave is inside the Hochkogel mountain in the Tennengebirge section of the Alps. It is the largest ice cave in the world, extending more than 42 km and visited by about 200,000 tourists every year.\n\nThe Tennengebirge mountains were formed during the late Tertiary period, during the Würm glaciation period of the Pleistocene. The mountain range, one of the massifs in the Austrian Alps, is the largest karst plateau in the Salzburger Alps, and the Eisriesenwelt is located at the rim of this plateau. Although the cave has a length of 42 km, only the first kilometer, the area that tourists are allowed to visit, is covered in ice. The rest of the cave is formed of limestone.\n\nEisriesenwelt was formed by the Salzach river, which eroded passageways into the mountain. The ice formations in the cave were formed by thawing snow which drained into the cave and froze during winter.\n\nSince the entrance to the caves is open year-round, chilly winter winds blow into the cave and freeze the snow inside. In summer, a cold wind from inside the cave blows toward the entrance and prevents the formations from melting.\n\nThe first official discovery of Eisriesenwelt was by Anton Posselt, a natural scientist from Salzburg, in 1879, though he only explored the first two hundred meters of the cave. Before his discovery, the cave was known only to locals, who, believing that it was an entrance to Hell, refused to explore it. In 1880, Posselt published his findings in a mountaineering magazine, but the report was quickly forgotten.\n\n, a speleologist from Salzburg, was one of the few people who remembered Posselt's discovery. He led several expeditions into the caves beginning in 1912, which were soon followed by other explorers. Von Mörk was killed in World War I in 1914, and an urn containing his ashes is inside a niche in the cave. In 1920, a cabin for the explorers, Forscherhütte, was built and the first routes up the mountain were established. Tourists began to arrive soon after, attracted by the cave's sudden popularity. Later another cabin, the Dr. Oedl House, and paths from Werfen and Tänneck were constructed.\n\nIn 1955 a cable car was built, shortening the 90-minute climb to 3 minutes. Today the Eisriesenwelt cave is owned by the , which has leased it to the Salzburg Association of Cave Exploration since 1928. The Forest Commission still receives a percentage of the entrance fees.\n\nThe cave is open from May 1 to October 26 every year. Its operating hours are 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in July and August and 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. in May/June and September/October. Temperatures inside the cave are usually below freezing, and warm clothing is recommended. Photography is not permitted once visitors are inside the cave.\n\nThe tour begins at the entrance to the cave, and continues inwards to Posselt Hall, a large room with a stalagmite called Posselt Tower in the centre. Past the Posselt Tower, one encounters an ashen cross on the wall of the cave, marking the farthest point of exploration of Anton Posselt. From there one can see the Great Ice Embankment, a massive formation that rises to a height of 25 metres and represents the area of greatest ice growth. Next is Hymir's Castle, named after a giant in Norse mythology. Here stalactites create a formation called Frigga's Veil, or the Ice Organ.\n\nNext on the tour is the Alexander von Mörk Cathedral, one of the largest rooms in the cave and the final resting place of von Mörk's ashes. The final stop on the tour is the Ice Palace, a kilometre into the cave and 400 metres underground. From here, visitors must turn around and walk back through the caves to reach the entrance. The round-trip tour through the cave takes around one hour and 15 minutes.\n\n"}

{"id": "2174443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174443", "title": "Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition", "text": "Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition\n\nThe Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, commonly also known as the Lewis and Clark Exposition, and officially known as the Lewis and Clark Centennial and American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair, was a worldwide exposition held in Portland, Oregon, United States in 1905 to celebrate the centennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. While not officially considered a World's Fair by the Bureau of International Expositions, it is often informally described as such; the exposition attracted both exhibits and visitors from around the world. During the exposition's four-month run, it attracted over 1.6 million visitors, and featured exhibits from 21 countries. Portland grew from 161,000 to 270,000 residents between 1905 and 1910, a spurt that has been attributed to the exposition.\n\nSince its founding in 1845, Portland had evolved into a major economic center, largely fueled by the arrival of the railroads. Three transcontinental railroads used Portland as their Pacific coast terminus – the Northern, Southern, and Union Pacific Railroads. Meanwhile, Portland's wheat and flour industries were growing at an amazing rate, and Portland held \"the largest flour mill on the Pacific coast.\" The unparalleled timber industry continued to grow, as \"Oregon is second [in wooded area], with 54,300 square miles\" and \"in quantity of standing lumber, Oregon leads the Union, with 300 billion feet ...\" Oregon's shipping was growing, too, fueled by a $1.5 million project to dike and dredge the Columbia River. During this time, Oregon's population grew from 13,294 in 1850 to 413,536 in 1900, a 3,000-percent growth, compared to the 1000-percent growth of the nation as a whole.\n\nDespite all these positive factors, though, Oregon was not unaffected by the nationwide Long Depression, which had particular effect in 1893. Jobs were lost across the country as railroads grew too fast on a weak banking system and agricultural values fell. The state's elite business leaders all attempted to devise plans to boost the economy. Dan McAllen, a dry goods merchant, suggested in 1895 \"that Portland mark the new century and pull itself out of its economic slump by holding some sort of international fair.\" Since the area's focus was on other issues, his proposal went unnoticed for a few years. The idea of a fair came up again occasionally, but no concentrated effort was made for various reasons. It was not until mid-1900 that this sort of action began, when \"J.M. Long of the Portland Board of Trade put together a provisional committee\" to begin planning some sort of fair.\n\nSoon, a permanent board was conceived, and the head of the Portland General Electric Company, Henry W. Goode, became the president of the Board of Directors. Others included I. N. Fleischner, First Vice-President; Oskar Huber, Director of Works; Colonel Henry E. Dosch, Director of Exhibits; Henry E. Reed, Secretary; and J. A. Wakefield, Director of Concessions and Admissions. These were some of Portland's most wealthy and powerful men, working together to create an event of unmatched grandeur and power.\n\nAlthough the true motivation for the fair came from an economic and business standpoint, it was still crucial to have a theme for publicity and décor. The theme for the Portland fair came from the advice of the Oregon Historical Society. They suggested that the centennial anniversary of the Lewis and Clark Expedition's stay in Oregon would be a perfect event to commemorate. As the directors wanted to include their dreams of economic growth as well, they combined the two ideas into a title that \"summed up the dual goals of historic commemoration and regional boosterism: 'The Lewis and Clark Centennial and American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair.'\" In addition, a motto was decided on, to focus the festivities and bolster publicity: \"Westward The Course of Empire Takes Its Way.\"\n\nOnce a theme was set, the men began securing exhibits and getting support for their investments. Getting government backing was crucial due to the personal investments already made: \"The Ladd and Tilton Bank [invested] $20,000, the Northern Pacific Railroad another $20,000, and brewer Henry Weinhard $10,000.\" Many of the substantial investments were from hotels (the Imperial Hotel Company purchased 50 shares worth $5,000), restaurants, streetcar companies, and retailers – all groups with much to gain from the success of the fair and the economic prosperity it could provide. In addition, approximately 3,000 average citizens purchased stock certificates both as investment opportunities and to support what they viewed as a worthwhile venture. These individual investments eventually paid off greatly.\n\nSeeing the potential benefits of the fair's success, the state legislature began planning appropriations for the fair. Although they \"had [little] interest in the historical heroes and their trek ... they [shared] the vision of Pacific trade that had motivated the exploration and settlement of the Oregon Country.\" Thus, the Legislature passed \"An Act Celebrating the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Exploration of the Oregon Country,\" which appropriated a sum of approximately $500,000 for the fair. After the Fair's completion, it was reported that\n\nThe money expended by the two departments amounted to about four hundred thousand dollars each, the State appropriating that expended by the Commission, while the stockholders of the Corporation subscribed about an equal amount. The proceeds from the Exposition were expended entirely under the direction of the Corporation. The government of the United States appropriated $475,000 and about an equal value in exhibits, the exact amounts of which I am unable to give.\n\nThus the fair received funding to hold the exposition.\n\nThe bill that appropriated the funds also created a special commission to oversee the organization of the fair. As this Commission reported: \"The Lewis and Clark Exposition was held jointly, under the authorization of the act creating this Commission, by the Commission and the Lewis and Clark Exposition Corporation.\" First assembling on May 30, 1903, they were a committee appointed by the government with the intent of sharing the burdens of planning. On this date, they chose a president, Jefferson Myers, who \"made a speech ... urging hearty co-operation with the Lewis and Clark directors to bring about the best results. He later repeated these assurances of help to the directors.\" This seemed to go well, and their assistance helped guide the fair through the governmental hurdles inherent with the planning of such a venture.\n\nAfter the closing of the fair, Henry Reed, Secretary for the Exposition Corporation, created a hefty volume documenting the whole process of planning and running the event. He, too, spoke highly of the government's involvement, and wrote that \"The State of Oregon gave more solid help ... to the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, than any other state of the Union has ever given to an exposition held within its borders.\" He was also specifically grateful for the City of Portland's assistance, and noted that their \"cordial and enthusiastic backing\" was invaluable to the success of the Fair. These praises of Portland were repeated by the State Commission, further supporting the city's great assistance.\n\nAfter gaining the necessary financial backing (and the Commission that came with it), the Board of Directors then began the process of choosing a site on which to hold this fair. There were a number of locations considered, on both the east and west sides of the Willamette River. The three main sites on the eastern side were University Park, now the site of the University of Portland; City View Park, now Sellwood Park and Oaks Park; and Hawthorne Park, now an industrial area. The western sites considered were City Park, now Washington Park; and Guild's Lake in the Balch Creek watershed. Guild's Lake was a site \"everyone in Portland was vaguely aware of ... [though] no one on the site selection subcommittee could remember whether it evaporated during the dry season.\" Inspections showed it remained at a depth of through the summer, and therefore would be an appropriate site. By September 4, 1902, the \"Oregon Journal\" reported \"the fair officials are hot on the trail of a site and it is confidently predicted that 'something will be doing' shortly.\" The next day, they reported the committee narrowed its choices to \"two tracts ... Willamette heights on the west side and Hawthorne Park, with a portion of the Ladd tract, on the east side,\" and that Willamette Heights was to be chosen, as \"It is claimed that the natural advantages offered by the Willamette Heights outweigh all other considerations and that ... Guild's Lake, it is said, can be utilized to great advantage and made a scene of beauty.\" With this voting, \"the Lewis and Clark Exposition had its site – a grove of trees, of pasture, and of waist-high stagnant water at the site's center.\"\n\nGuild's Lake had numerous other advantages. As the site was located on the edge of settlement in Portland, it was easily accessed by the populace. Two local trolley lines (the Portland Railway and City Suburban Railway) ran to within one block of the proposed entrance. Guild's Lake also had the advantage of being located adjacent to the recently constructed Vaughn Street Park, a baseball stadium which would prove rather useful during the operation of the fair. The site was also accessible from the river, and steamers provided visitors a ride to the site for 10 cents.\n\nThe site was sold for private development prior to the fair, and was leased back to the city for the event.\n\nNumerous individuals were involved in the design and construction of the fairgrounds and buildings. The Olmsted Brothers design firm was hired to develop a plan for the grounds, for $5,000. The plan designed by John Charles Olmsted took advantage of the scenic views available from the site, including Mount St. Helens and the river. (Olmsted also developed a plan for Portland's park system during the same visit.)\n\nIon Lewis, of the firm Whidden & Lewis, supervised a board of seven architects responsible for designing the fair's buildings. The six other architects were Edgar M. Lazarus, Emil Schacht, Justus F. Krumbein, David C. Lewis, Richard Martin, Jr., and Henry J. Hefty. The majority of the buildings were in the style of the Spanish Renaissance and decorated with architectural flourishes such as domes, cupolas, arched doorways and red-colored roofs. The buildings, not intended to be permanent, were largely constructed of plaster over wooden frames, which resulted in rather low construction costs (79 cents per foot).\n\nThe major exception to this was the Forestry Building, a log cabin which was said to be the world's largest. It was constructed of 54 long unhewn logs, and contained exhibits of local forestry products, wildlife, and Native American photographs. The building was long, wide, and high (63 m x 31m x 22m), and cost nearly $30,000 The building stood until destroyed by fire in 1964 and inspired the Western Forestry Center as a replacement. It also inspired the lobby of the Glacier Park Lodge in Montana.\n\nThe fair was lit up by night with incandescent lights, as well as large searchlights on the Government Building. These were designed by Thomas H. Wright, working for Portland General Electric.\n\nIn addition, numerous statues adorned the grounds. Several of the statues remain today, including Alice Cooper's \"Sacajawea and Jean-Baptiste\" which now stands in Washington Park. Over 100 thousand light bulbs were used to outline the buildings, bridges, and statues; the result was a spectacular nighttime view.\n\nSome exhibits took up to three years to assemble.\n\nThe exposition opened on June 1, 1905, and ran until October 15, 1905, a four and a half month span. It included exhibitions from 21 nations and 16 U.S. states, as well as numerous branches of the federal government, and private organizations.\n\nThe largest exhibit by a foreign nation was Italy's, whose pavilion contained a large collection of marble statues. Germany and France also spent enormous sums on their exhibits, the latter providing a replica of the drawing room of King Louis XIV. Japan spent $1 million (a significant sum in 1905) on its exhibit, including numerous cultural artifacts such as porcelains, silks, and lanterns.\n\nStates with exhibits at the exposition were: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Oklahoma, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. Each attending state was granted a day to publicize its exhibit, often attended by visiting dignitaries.\n\nThere were extensive exhibits on topics such as agriculture, technology, and music. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir sent an exhibit, as did the Smithsonian Institution; numerous famous artists such as Claude Monet were featured. Some of the exhibits were controversial (and by modern standards, offensive), such as an exhibit of Philippines Igorot tribespeople; displayed in order to convince the American populace of the legitimacy of the recent U.S. conquest of the Philippines, taken from Spain in the recently concluded Spanish–American War. The exhibit included Irogots living in a simulated village, engaging in traditional activities. Some of these activities, such as preparation and consumption of dog meat, would be viewed as primitive to most visitors.\n\nMany exhibitors had to be turned away due to lack of space.\n\nIn addition to the major exhibits and pavilions, the site also featured an amusement park, various sideshows, concerts, free motion pictures (a novelty in those days), blimp excursions, and numerous vendors selling food and other items. The site was the finish line for a transcontinental automobile race (\"Hell Gate to Portland\") by two drivers sponsored by Olds Motor Works. The Amateur Athletic Union's National Track and Field Championships were held in Portland at Vaughn Street Park. Portland's Pacific Coast League baseball team, known then as the \"Giants\", played the 1905 season at a different venue in Portland.\n\nThe fair, by all economic measures, was a major success. Over the entire run of the fair, the box office recorded almost 1.6 million paid admissions, an average of 11,600 visitors per day. Tickets to the fair cost 50 cents for adults, a quarter for children. Forty-thousand visitors attended on the opening day; 50,000 attended on the Fourth of July, and on the anniversary of Portland's incorporation, the daily attendance record of over 85,000 visitors was set. The vast majority (nearly 75%) of visitors were from the Pacific Northwest, with almost half being local residents. In all 2,554,000 people visited the exposition, with 966,000 getting in for free and 1,588,000 paying visitors. 135,000 visitors were from east of the Mississippi River.\n\nUnusual for such expositions, the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition was profitable, turning a gross profit of nearly $85,000. Capital investors received a 21% return on their investments. In addition, the impact on the local economy was significant. It is estimated a million out-of-town guests came to Portland, resulting in millions of dollars (in 1905 figures) added to the economy. In addition, construction of the fairgrounds provided 1,000 construction jobs.\n\nVery little of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition remains today. The vast majority of the structures were designed to be temporary, and were torn down the following year, in 1906. A few structures were moved elsewhere and remained in use for a long time, most famously the Forestry Building, which was reinforced with a concrete foundation and converted into a forestry museum. It burned to the ground in August 1964. A replacement museum was built in Portland's Washington Park and is today known as the World Forestry Center. A few buildings from the fair remain standing today, including the Fairmount Hotel, the American Inn, and the National Cash Register Building (now the McMenamins St. Johns Theater and Pub).\n\nAbout half a million pink hybrid tea rose bushes, all \"Mme Caroline Testout,\" were planted along the streets of Portland for the Lewis and Clark Exposition. Many of these remain today.\n\nMany people moved to Portland following the fair, which is why many houses around Portland were built in the years that followed. There were also many street paving and sidewalk projects in the years that followed the fair, and many of the sidewalks in Portland (East Portland especially) are dated from 1910 to 1920.\n\nGuild's Lake, a cutoff meander of the Willamette River around which the fairgrounds were built, was slowly filled in by industrial developers (and the Port of Portland) in the years after the fair; by the 1920s the lake had vanished entirely. Over the years, the grounds have been used for a garbage incinerator, a landfill, a rail switching yard, wartime housing, and warehouses. Today the ground formerly occupied by the lake (and the fairgrounds itself) is still used for primarily industrial purposes, and has been designated an Industrial Sanctuary by the City of Portland.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2174453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174453", "title": "Lotus effect", "text": "Lotus effect\n\nThe lotus effect refers to self-cleaning properties that are a result of ultrahydrophobicity as exhibited by the leaves of \"Nelumbo\" or \"lotus flower\". Dirt particles are picked up by water droplets due to the micro- and nanoscopic architecture on the surface, which minimizes the droplet's adhesion to that surface. Ultrahydrophobicity and self-cleaning properties are also found in other plants, such as \"Tropaeolum\" (nasturtium), \"Opuntia\" (prickly pear), \"Alchemilla\", cane, and also on the wings of certain insects.\n\nThe phenomenon of ultrahydrophobicity was first studied by Dettre and Johnson in 1964 using rough hydrophobic surfaces. Their work developed a theoretical model based on experiments with glass beads coated with paraffin or PTFE telomer. The self-cleaning property of ultrahydrophobic micro-nanostructured surfaces was studied by Wilhelm Barthlott and Ehler in 1977, who described such self-cleaning and ultrahydrophobic properties for the first time as the \"lotus effect\"; perfluoroalkyl and perfluoropolyether ultrahydrophobic materials were developed by Brown in 1986 for handling chemical and biological fluids. Other biotechnical applications have emerged since the 1990s.\n\nThe high surface tension of water causes droplets to assume a nearly spherical shape, since a sphere has minimal surface area, and this shape therefore minimizes the solid-liquid surface energy. On contact of liquid with a surface, adhesion forces result in wetting of the surface. Either complete or incomplete wetting may occur depending on the structure of the surface and the fluid tension of the droplet.\nThe cause of self-cleaning properties is the hydrophobic water-repellent double structure of the surface. This enables the contact area and the adhesion force between surface and droplet to be significantly reduced, resulting in a self-cleaning process.\nThis hierarchical double structure is formed out of a characteristic epidermis (its outermost layer called the cuticle) and the covering waxes. The epidermis of the lotus plant possesses papillae 10 μm to 20 μm in height and 10 μm to 15 μm in width on which the so-called epicuticular waxes are imposed. These superimposed waxes are hydrophobic and form the second layer of the double structure. This system regenerates. This biochemical property is responsible for the functioning of the water repellency of the surface.\n\nThe hydrophobicity of a surface can be measured by its contact angle. The higher the contact angle the higher the hydrophobicity of a surface. Surfaces with a contact angle < 90° are referred to as hydrophilic and those with an angle >90° as hydrophobic. Some plants show contact angles up to 160° and are called ultrahydrophobic, meaning that only 2–3% of the surface of a droplet (of typical size) is in contact. Plants with a double structured surface like the lotus can reach a contact angle of 170°, whereby the droplet's contact area is only 0.6%. All this leads to a self-cleaning effect.\n\nDirt particles with an extremely reduced contact area are picked up by water droplets and are thus easily cleaned off the surface. If a water droplet rolls across such a contaminated surface the adhesion between the dirt particle, irrespective of its chemistry, and the droplet is higher than between the particle and the surface. This cleaning effect has been demonstrated on common materials such as stainless steel when a superhydrophobic surface is produced. As this self-cleaning effect is based on the high surface tension of water it does not work with organic solvents. Therefore, the hydrophobicity of a surface is no protection against graffiti.\n\nThis effect is of a great importance for plants as a protection against pathogens like fungi or algae growth, and also for animals like butterflies, dragonflies and other insects not able to cleanse all their body parts.\nAnother positive effect of self-cleaning is the prevention of contamination of the area of a plant surface exposed to light resulting in reduced photosynthesis.\n\nWhen it was discovered that the self-cleaning qualities of ultrahydrophobic surfaces come from physical-chemical properties at the microscopic to nanoscopic scale rather than from the specific chemical properties of the leaf surface, the possibility arose of using this effect in manmade surfaces, by mimicking nature in a general way rather than a specific one.\n\nSome nanotechnologists have developed treatments, coatings, paints, roof tiles, fabrics and other surfaces that can stay dry and clean themselves by replicating in a technical manner the self-cleaning properties of plants, such as the lotus plant. This can usually be achieved using special fluorochemical or silicone treatments on structured surfaces or with compositions containing micro-scale particulates.\n\nIn addition to chemical surface treatments, which can be removed over time, metals have been sculpted with femtosecond pulse lasers to produce the lotus effect. The materials are uniformly black at any angle, which combined with the self-cleaning properties might produce very low maintenance solar thermal energy collectors, while the high durability of the metals could be used for self-cleaning latrines to reduce disease transmission.\n\nFurther applications have been marketed, such as self-cleaning glasses installed in the sensors of traffic control units on German autobahns developed by a cooperation partner (Ferro GmbH). \nThe Swiss companies HeiQ and Schoeller Textil have developed stain-resistant textiles under the brand names \"HeiQ Eco Dry\" and \"nanosphere\" respectively. In October 2005, tests of the Hohenstein Research Institute showed that clothes treated with NanoSphere technology allowed tomato sauce, coffee and red wine to be easily washed away even after a few washes. Another possible application is thus with self-cleaning awnings, tarpaulins and sails, which otherwise quickly become dirty and difficult to clean.\n\nSuperhydrophobic coatings applied to microwave antennas can significantly reduce rain fade and the buildup of ice and snow. \"Easy to clean\" products in ads are often mistaken in the name of the self-cleaning properties of hydrophobic or ultrahydrophobic surfaces. Patterned ultrahydrophobic surfaces also show promise for \"lab-on-a-chip\" microfluidic devices and can greatly improve surface-based bioanalysis.\n\nSuperhydrophobic or hydrophobic properties have been used in dew harvesting, or the funneling of water to a basin for use in irrigation. The Groasis Waterboxx has a lid with a microscopic pyramidal structure based on the ultrahydrophobic properties that funnel condensation and rainwater into a basin for release to a growing plant's roots.\n\nAlthough the self-cleaning phenomenon of the lotus was possibly known in Asia long before (reference to the lotus effect is found in the \"Bhagavad Gita\",) its mechanism was explained only in the early 1970s after the introduction of the scanning electron microscope. Studies were performed with leaves of \"Tropaeolum\" and lotus (\"Nelumbo\"). \"The Lotus Effect\" is a registered trademark of STO SE & CO. KGAA (US Registration No. 2613850). Similar to lotus effect, a recent study has revealed a honeycomb like micro-structures on the taro leaf, which makes the leaf superhydrophobic. The measured contact angle on this leaf in this study is around 148 degrees. \n\n\n"}

He married Stina Lindberg, the daughter of actor and stage producer August Lindberg and Augusta Lindberg, and sister of Per Lindberg. Up to his father's death in 1915 Bergman was heavily sponsored by the family patriarch; after the old man died from a stroke it turned out that the family business had become highly indebted and Bergman was forced to start making money out of his writing and court readers in a more outgoing and more entertaining manner. He rose to the challenge and in the following ten years reached the peak of his work.\n\nMuch of his output takes place in a small town in mid-Sweden, which is growing into a parallel universe in a Balzacian manner. The shameful secrets of a dozen of interwoven families gradually come out of the closet as the stories grow increasingly symbolic.

She was outfitted as a gunboat with powerful 20-pounder rifled guns and 32-pounder cannon and was assigned to the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America.\n\nUSS \"Santiago de Cuba\" was a wooden, brigantine-rigged, side-wheel steamship built in 1861 at Brooklyn, New York. She was purchased by the Navy on 6 September 1861 at New York City; and was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 5 November 1861, Commander Daniel B. Ridgely in command.\n\nThe new steamer was ordered to Havana, Cuba,\n\n... to protect legitimate commerce and to suppress communications and traffic with or by the insurgents ...\n\nShe reached Havana on 17 November. On 3 December, she captured British blockade runner schooner, \"Victoria\", at sea some 90 miles west of Point Isabel, Texas, and sent the prize to Galveston, Texas. Four days later, she chased and overtook British schooner, \"Eugenia Smith\", but released her for want of evidence justifying a seizure. Thus, she began a career which kept her at sea during much of the Civil War.\n\n\"Santiago de Cuba\" scored next on 26 April 1862 when she took schooner, \"Mersey\", of Charleston, South Carolina; and she captured schooner, \"Maria\", on the 30th off Port Royal, South Carolina. Schooner, \"Lucy C. Holmes\", laden with cotton, fell into her clutches on 27 May, and the Union side wheeler seized blockade runners, \"Columbia\" on 3 August and \"Lavinia\" on the 27th—both off Abaco in the Bahamas.\n\nIn September, \"Santiago de Cuba\" was assigned to a newly organized \"Flying Squadron,\" created to seek out and capture Confederate commerce raiders \"Alabama\" and \"Florida\". The squadron caught several prizes but never found the elusive Southern warships.\n\nOn 21 June 1863, \"Santiago de Cuba\" overtook \"Victory\" off Palmetto Point, Eleuthera Island, ending a long chase after the British steamer had slipped through the blockade off Charleston with a cargo of cotton, tobacco, and turpentine. On the 25th, she took steamer, \"Britannia\", in the same area. On 15 July, she boarded steamer, \"Lizzie\", east of the Florida coast and sent the prize to Key West, Florida for trial.\n\nLate in the year, \"Santiago de Cuba\" sailed north for repairs and decommissioned on 30 December 1863.\n\nOverhaul completed, the side wheeler recommissioned on 6 June 1864 and resumed her chase. Some three months later, \"Santiago de Cuba\" took \"A. D. Vance\" at sea northeast of Wilmington, North Carolina attempting to carry a cargo of cotton to Europe. On 2 November 1864, blockade runner steamer, \"Lucy\", struck her colors in compliance with a demand from \"Santiago de Cuba\".\n\nSoon thereafter, the steamer began preparation for a new experience. She was assigned to the task force in which Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter attacked Fort Fisher on Christmas Eve, 1864. During the operation, she protected the landing troops as they went ashore, supported them during the fighting, and covered them as they reluctantly reembarked the next day, under orders of General Benjamin F. Butler, the army commander.\n\nPorter immediately began work organizing a new invasion force. The union warships and Army transports returned to the vicinity of Wilmington in mid-January 1865. After a bloody three-day fight, Fort Fisher fell on the 15th.\n\nThe next day, \"Santiago de Cuba\" embarked men wounded in the battle and sailed for Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nDuring the Civil War, the following crewmen of the USS \"Santiago de Cuba\" were awarded the Medal of Honor:\n\nBefore the war ended, \"Santiago de Cuba\" was the steamship that took Captain Robert Anderson (Civil War) and John George Nicolay, Private Secretary to President Lincoln, down to Cuba and then to Charleston, SC for the ceremonial re-raising of the flag at Ft Sumter on Friday, April 14, 1865. This ceremony was intended to celebrate the ending of the civil war and be the event that would be remembered at the conclusion of the American Civil War. It is Lincoln's assassination on that date that history remembers.\n\nSince the war had ended, \"Santiago de Cuba\" was decommissioned on 17 June 1865 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She was sold at public auction in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 21 September 1865.\n\nShe was redocumented on 16 November 1865. For more than two decades, she operated in mercantile service. On 7 December 1886, her engines were removed, and she was rigged as a schooner. Records of her subsequent career have disappeared.\n\n\nPictures of the USS \"Santigo de Cuba\"\n"}

Originally a blue-eyed soul singer, he switched to contemporary Christian music in the late-1980s. Gibson scored a number of hit singles, including \"Jesus Loves Ya\" (which spent a then-record 11 weeks at No. 1 on the CCM charts in 1991), \"Love Come Down\" (1990) and \"Friend in You\" (1988).\n\nGibson's \"Jesus Loves Ya\" was ranked No. 90 on \"CCM Magazine\"s \"The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music\", while the title track charted at No. 52 on the Top 100 Christian AC in 1991. According to Frontline Records and Gibson's websites, he has at least 22 CCM hit songs and 9 No. 1 songs.\n\nBorn in San Francisco, Gibson grew up in San Jose, California, returning to San Francisco as a teenager. He joined the United States Army at age 18 (serving in Germany in the 3rd Infantry Division) and discovered a knack for songwriting.\n\nUpon returning home to pursue a music career with his local band in the early 1980s, Gibson found his father had become a Christian. Gibson accepted Christ and, after attending church as a result of his dad's pestering, was baptized by his father in the bathtub.\n\nAfter Gibson got out of the army at age 20, he signed with Dick Griffey's Constellation Records (SOLAR) as a rhythm and blues artist. His debut as a singer and songwriter came as a guest vocalist and songwriter on several songs for The Jacksons' keyboardist, Bill Wolfer's project entitled \"Wolf\" (on the Constellation label). The album included Michael Jackson singing background vocals on the Gibson/Wolfer collaboration \"So Shy\". Griffey circulated Gibson's demo tape, with people believing they were listening to Stevie Wonder (who Gibson sang \"Ebony and Ivory\" with while on tour in 1983).\n\nGibson released his debut album \"Standing on the One\" (1983) with Constellation and produced the 1983 single \"She Told Me So\" via Elektra Records (including a music video that premiered on MTV). Gibson, however, being torn between his desire for pop stardom and his need to give testimony to his faith, entered the Christian music industry when he signed with Frontline Records in 1986.\n\nGibson's second album \"On the Run\" (1986) was well received, rendering his first No. 1 single in Contemporary Christian music on Christian radio, entitled \"God Loves a Broken Heart\". It became the first of a string of over 20 Top Ten CCM Hits. Gibson also experienced success with the No. 1 single \"Friend in You\", a ballad which is one of CCM's classic hit songs, from \"Change of Heart\". On this album, he did a cover of \"Yah Mo B There\", a song originally performed by James Ingram and Michael McDonald, and co-written by Rod Temperton and Quincy Jones.\n\nAlthough his first rap solo was 1986's \"Ain't It Pretty\" from the album \"On the Run\", Gibson wrote and produced the first rap hit in CCM history (by anyone) called \"The Wall\" featuring M.C. Hammer (it was originally within the lyrics of this song that Stanley Kirk Burrell - or \"K.B.\" - first identified himself as M.C. Hammer and Gibson as \"J.G.\"). Prior to this time, he was a part of Hammer's gospel rap group Holy Ghost Boys, with songs having been produced before being released on their respective albums. For instance, Hammer would later release a song called \"Son of the King\" on his debut album \"Feel My Power\" (1986) and Gibson released \"The Wall\" on his \"Change of Heart\" album (1988). Burrell, along with Tramaine Hawkins, previously performed with Gibson's band doing several concerts in various halls such as the Beverly Theatre in Beverly Hills.\n\nGibson was reunited with Stevie Wonder on the 1989 album \"Body & Soul\", with Wonder playing harmonica on a remake of his own song called \"Have a Talk with God\" (from 1976's \"Songs in the Key of Life\"). Wonder's 1991 soundtrack album \"Jungle Fever\" would go on to have Gibson singing backup in return (such as on the track \"I Go Sailing\"), even touring together.\n\nGene Andrusco, Rick Zunigar and Rob Watson assisted on the album \"Jesus Loves Ya\" (1990), which had two hit singles—the title track and the song \"Love Come Down\". But there were several elements that frustrated the relationship between Gibson and Frontline Records. The main issue was the fact that through the years Gibson was receiving little if no payment for his recordings. \"My contract was over when I completed the album \"Forever Friends\"\", Gibson says. In the end, Frontline Records ran into serious financial trouble and Gibson decided to create his own record label, resulting in a nearly three-year hiatus before his next disc, \"Love Education\" (peaking at No. 19). Afterward he signed with Ojo Taylor and Gene Eugene of Brainstorm Artists International. Gibson then got married, had children, and took time off from his music again. Upon returning, he searched for a record contract for two years, finally landing with gospel record label B-Rite Music in 1999 for his \"The Man Inside\" record, a consciously urban-sounding album made with producer Tommy Sims. It didn't fare as well as previous records, and Gibson again decided to take his career into his own hands, creating his own Imagery Records and releasing his first praise album, \"Soulful Hymns\", in 2002.\n\nIn 2009, Gibson recorded his 10th solo album, \"The Horizons of Knowing\", with plans for release in late November or early December 2010. However, the album was never released. On June 7, 2010, Gibson released the single \"On a Mission\" which was available as a download.\n\nEventually, the song \"I'm on a Mission\" was included on his 2012 album \"The Storyteller\" (a tribute album to his father Stan Gibson who led Jon to the Christian faith in 1981). A portion of the funding for the album was raised via Kickstarter. It was released on an independent record label by Soul Scan Music and mixed by engineer Dennis Moody.\n\nGibson writes, arranges, and produces most of his albums, and plays most of the instruments. Comments Gibson, \"I'm not a trained musician. I never took music in school. I dropped out of school in 9th grade. I don't know how to read and write notes. I don't play with any proper technique; I just grab instruments and play them. Everything I learned to play, I figured out myself. So I'm not the best musician, but if you give me time, without people coming around, pressuring me ('We have to finish this record by the GMA') when I don't have these pressures on me, I can do tracks closer to the feeling I really want if I play it myself. It takes me longer, but I get more of the feeling I really want if I play it myself.\"\n\nGibson employs an eclectic soul band called The Groove Masters. In 2005, Prince hired Gibson's band for his Golden Globe Award house party, collaborating with Justin Timberlake, Herbie Hancock, Maroon 5 and Matthew McConaughey.\n\nHis voice has been compared to Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Donny Hathaway.\n\nGibson married Lisa Rea in 1995. They have three children together: Jonathon Thomas Gibson, James Robert Gibson and Jesse Earl Gibson. Gibson became a licensed minister after his youngest son was born on Christmas day in 2004.\n\nGibson leads worship services across the nation and performs for multi-genre, mainstream audiences/celebrities worldwide. He's also a music minister at a California church and a music director of CSN Radio (KAWZ). Additionally, Gibson is the Program Director and Network Manager of Effect Radio, a network of Christian music radio stations across the U.S.\n\nHe is working on his 11th solo album to be released in 2018.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2174489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174489", "title": "Plan of Saint Gall", "text": "Plan of Saint Gall\n\nThe Plan of Saint Gall is a medieval architectural drawing of a monastic compound dating from 820–830 AD. It depicts an entire Benedictine monastic compound, including churches, houses, stables, kitchens, workshops, brewery, infirmary, and a special house for bloodletting. According to calculations based on the manuscript's tituli the complex was meant to house about 110 monks, 115 lay visitors, and 150 craftmen and agricultural workers. The Plan was never actually built, and was so named because it is dedicated to Gozbert abbot of Saint Gall. The planned church was intended to keep the relics of Saint Gall. The plan was kept at the famous medieval monastery library of the Abbey of St. Gall – Stiftsbibliothek Sankt Gallen – where it remains to this day (Ms 1092).\n\nIt is the only surviving major architectural drawing from the roughly 700-year period between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the 13th century. It is considered a national treasure of Switzerland and remains a significant object of interest among modern scholars, architects, artists and draftsmen for its uniqueness, its beauty, and the insights it provides into medieval culture.\n\nThere are two main theories concerning the motivations behind the drawing of the Plan. The dispute between scholars centres around the assertion put forward by Horn and Born in their 1979 work \"The Plan of Saint Gall\", that the Plan in the Stiftsbibliothek Sankt Gallen was a copy of an original drawing issued by the court of Louis the Pious after the synods held at Aachen in 816 and 817. The purpose of the synods was to establish Benedictine monasteries throughout the Carolingian Empire as a bulwark against encroaching Christian monastic missionaries from Britain and Ireland who were bringing Celtic lifestyle influences to the Continent (see Celtic art). Horn and Born argued that the Plan was a \"paradigmatic\" drawing of how a Benedictine monastery should look if the Benedictine Rule was to be strictly followed; a guide for the construction of future monastic ensembles.\n\nOther scholars, particularly Werner Jacobsen, Norbert Stachura and Lawrence Nees have, on the contrary, argued that the Plan is an original drawing made at the Monastery of Reichenau for the abbot of Saint Gall, Gozbert, who decided to build a new abbey church in the 820s. This argument is based on Jacobsen's observations of marks left by pairs of compasses in the parchment, as well as alterations and changes undertaken during its drawing. Lawrence Nees has also argued that the fact that the manuscript was drawn and written by two scribes, a younger one and an elder who acted as a supervisor \"filling in and completing where the knowledge of the main scribe ended\", can only be explained if the drawing is an original. \nThe Plan was created from five parchments sewn together, and measures 45 inches by 31 inches (113 cm by 78 cm). It is drawn with red ink lines for the buildings, and brown ink for lettered inscriptions. The sequence in which the parchment was joined is the following: the first parchment consisted of the drawing of the abbey church and cloister; the second and third parchments were added to the bottom and right side of the original vellum, and here the abbey church was enlarged; buildings were added around the cloister; and the abbot's house, outer school, guest house and pilgrim's house were drawn. A fourth parchment was then added to the top where the infirmary, novitiate, cemetery, orchard, garden were drawn; and finally a fifth parchment was added to the bottom to accommodate the designs for the livestock quarters.\n\nAbout 333 inscriptions, forty of them in meter, in the handwritings of two different scribes, describe the functions of the buildings. It has been possible to attribute the handwriting of these scribes to the monastery of Reichenau and one of them has been identified as monk Reginbert.\n\nThe scale to which the Plan was drawn has also been a subject of dispute. Horn and Born, for example, argue that a single scale was used while others, such as Reinle and Jacobsen, argue that multiple scales were applied for different elements.\n\nThe reverse of the Plan was inscribed in the 12th century, after it had been folded into book form, with the Life of Saint Martin by Sulpicius Severus.\n\nIt is widely held that the Plan was dedicated to Gozbertus, the Abbot of St Gall from 816–36. However, recently Alfons Zettler has put forward the possibility of it being dedicated to another monk, Gozbert – known as young Gozbert – also an inhabitant of the monastery of Saint Gall during the same period.\n\nThe text reads [as translated by Horn into English]:\n\nThe Latin reads:\n\nAs mentioned above the Plan represents a Benedictine monastery and it is possible to see the Benedictine Rule being applied in the architectural design. One of the main aspects of the Rule was the ascetic life of the monks who had to dedicate themselves to prayer, meditation and study, and not worry about worldly matters. For this purpose, the Benedictine Rule required a monastery which was self-sufficient, and which provided for the monks all the necessary facilities, food, and water. The Plan thus depicts 40 ground plans which include not only the properly monastic buildings (basilica, cloister, abbot's house and cemetery) but also secular buildings for the use of lay workers and visitors.\n\nLynda Coon has identified five distinct \"spatial-units\":\n\n\nShe has also identified a status differentiation in the structures which follow the cardinal points. Accordingly, she argues that the northwest is reserved for the secular elite while the southwest is for the secular lower classes. Regarding the sacred spaces, the northeast and southeast is reserved for the monastic elite, and the far east and far south for what she calls \"the liminal\", that is to say in between lay and monastic.\n\nAlfons Zettler has recently identified another criterion that the authors of the Plan may have followed for the layout of the structures, which does not follow the cardinal points but is determined by a clockwise direction starting and ending at the abbot's house. He argues that the basis of the organisation would have been a division of public/private and lay/monastic which is represented in the Plan by an increasing lay presence in each sector of the monastery when moving around the cloister clockwise from the infirmary.\n\nThe monastic cloister occupies the centre of the Plan. It is placed in the southeast aligning itself both with the sacred east and with the poor – the accommodation for pilgrims and the poor is placed in the east just beneath the cloister – far from the worldly commodities and pleasures of the secular elite.\n\nThe structure of the cloister is highly symbolic. Firstly, it is a closed space looking inwards to its own centre where a savin tree is placed – – illustrating the ideal of a monk's experience removed from the world. Secondly, it is foursquare and four paths lead from its covered galleries to the centre – – symbolising Jerusalem and its four rivers.\n\nThe cloister is surrounded by two-storied buildings consisting of the warming room and dormitory to the east – and – the refectory, vestiary and kitchen to the south – , and – and the cellar and larder to the west – and . The monks, as well as the abbot, had a private entrance to the basilica either through their dormitory or through the portico of the cloister.\n\nThe abbot's intermediary position between the clerical and lay worlds is seen in the position of his accommodation on the Plan. The abbot's quarters are located at the other side of the abbey church from the monk's cloister, to the north-east, aligning itself with the secular elite guest houses where the royalty, the emperor and the emperor's court would lodge. The abbot's house also looks over the infirmary and novitiate to the east, the outer school and the house for elite guests to the west.\n\nThe abbot's house faces outwards, its porticoes opening to the outside world, in opposition with the monk's cloister porticoes which open to an enclosed green space. However, in order to comply with an ascetic way of life and to the Benedictine Rule, the abbot shares his bedroom and privy with seven other monks, and his servant quarters are set apart.\n\nFinally, the abbot's residence has a privileged entry to the east-end of the basilica through a private passageway – – signalling his spiritual status as head of the monastery.\nThe monastery church or basilica is cruciform in shape and doubled-apsed to the east and to the west. It measures c.91.44 meters from apse to apse, the nave is c.12 meters in width and each aisle is c.6 meters in width.\n\nIn the west entrance there are two towers dedicated to St. Michael (northern tower) and St. Gabriel (southern tower). The inscriptions on the towers – \"ad universa super inspicienda\" – give them a surveillance function while no indication of bells is given.\n\nThe entrance to the church is also the only entrance to the whole monastic complex and it is marked by a square porch inscribed: (Here all the arriving crowd will find their entry). From here the visitors are directed to a semi-circular atrium where they are separated to different parts of the monastery depending on their status – the elite is directed to the north gate and the pilgrims and lower-classes to the south gate – or to the church.\n\nThe interior of the church is divided by columns and railings which not only direct the lay visitors to their authorised spaces but also block their view of the sacred east where the altar of Saint Mary and Saint Gall is placed. According to Horn and Born only one-sixth of the church is accessible to seculars while five-sixths of it is reserved for the sole use of the monks. Lay guests are only admitted in the side aisles of the church, the area around the baptismal font – – and the crypt – ; the only place in the church where monks and seculars mix to worship at the tomb of Saint Gall. The transept, the presbytery, the nave and the two apses (dedicated to Saint Peter to the west and Saint Paul to the east) being solely for the ascetics' use.\n\nThe northern and southern aisles of the basilica are furnished with four altars each. The northern aisle houses the altars (from west to east) of Saints Lucia and Cecilia, of the Holy Innocents, of Saint Martin, and of Saint Stephen. The altars on the southern aisle are dedicated (from west to east) to Saints Agatha and Agnes, to Saint Sebastian, to Saint Mauritius, and to Saint Lawrence.\n\nThe nave opens to the aisles through nine arcades in each side, three of them \"railed off\" to prevent the entry of laymen. The main surface of the nave houses the baptismal font, the altar of Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, the altar of the Holy Saviour at the Cross and the ambo. The transept is separated from the nave by further screens and railings, in its southern arm is the altar of Saint Andrew and in its northern arm the altar of Saints Philipp and James. From the transcript the monks and lay brothers access the crypt. Finally, at the easternmost of the church is the presbytery with the high altar dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint Gall.\n\nAccording to Earl Anderson (Cleveland State University), it is likely that Umberto Eco references the plan in his novel \"The Name of the Rose\":\n\nThe Plan has inspired a tradition of model making. In 1965 Ernest Born and others created a scale model of the plan for the \"Age of Charlemagne\" exhibition in Aachen, Germany. This became the inspiration for the book he co-authored in 1979 with Walter Horn, but was also the first in a tradition of modeling the plan. More recently the plan has been modeled on computers using CAD software. It is possible to see the different models in the Saint Gall Project website.\n\nCampus Galli is a Carolingian monastic community under construction in Meßkirch, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The construction project includes plans to build a medieval monastery according to the early 9th-century Plan of Saint Gall using techniques from that era. The long-term financing of the project is to come from revenue generated from the site's operation as a tourist attraction. The construction site has been open for visitors since June 2013.\n\nThe St. Gall Project was founded to produce a digital online presence for the plan including models and an extensive online database on early medieval monastic culture. The project is directed by Patrick Geary (UCLA) and Bernard Frischer (University of Virginia) with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The website was released to the public in December 2007. Future resources will include intellectual and textual aspects of the plan and monasticism; space for publication of new papers and research, lesson plans and teaching aides, blogs and chat rooms.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The entries of the Sylvester matrix of two polynomials are coefficients of the polynomials. The determinant of the Sylvester matrix of two polynomials is their resultant, which is zero when the two polynomials have a common root (in case of coefficients in a field) or a non-constant common divisor (in case of coefficients in an integral domain).\n\nSylvester matrices are named after James Joseph Sylvester.\n\nFormally, let \"p\" and \"q\" be two nonzero polynomials, respectively of degree \"m\" and \"n\". Thus:\nThe Sylvester matrix associated to \"p\" and \"q\" is then the formula_2 matrix constructed as follows:\n\nThus, if \"m\" = 4 and \"n\" = 3, the matrix is:\n\nIf one of the degrees is zero (that is the corresponding polynomial is a nonzero constant), then there are zero rows consisting of coefficients of the other polynomial, and the Sylvester matrix is a diagonal matrix of dimension the degree of the non-constant polynomial, with the all diagonal coefficients equal to the constant polynomial. If \"m\" = \"n\" = 0, then the Sylvester matrix is the empty matrix with zero rows and zero columns.\n\nThe above defined Sylvester matrix appears in a Sylvester paper of 1840. In a paper of 1853, Sylvester introduced the following matrix, which is, up to a permutation of the rows, the Sylvester matrix of \"p\" and \"q\", which are both considered as having degree max(\"m\", \"n\").\nThis is thus a formula_6-matrix containing formula_7 pairs of rows. Assuming formula_8 it is obtained as follows:\n\nThus, if \"m\" = 4 and \"n\" = 3, the matrix is:\n\nThe determinant of the 1853 matrix is, up to sign, the product of the determinant of the Sylvester matrix (which is called the resultant of \"p\" and \"q\") by formula_12 (still supposing formula_13).\n\nThese matrices are used in commutative algebra, e.g. to test if two polynomials have a (non constant) common factor. In such a case, the determinant of the associated Sylvester matrix (which is named the resultant of the two polynomials) equals zero. The converse is also true.\n\nThe solutions of the simultaneous linear equations\nwhere formula_15 is a vector of size formula_16 and formula_17 has size formula_18, comprise the coefficient vectors of those and only those pairs formula_19 of polynomials (of degrees formula_20 and formula_21, respectively) which fulfill\nwhere polynomial multiplication and addition is used.\nThis means the kernel of the transposed Sylvester matrix gives all solutions of the Bézout equation where formula_23 and formula_24.\n\nConsequently the rank of the Sylvester matrix determines the degree of the greatest common divisor of \"p\" and \"q\":\nMoreover, the coefficients of this greatest common divisor may be expressed as determinants of submatrices of the Sylvester matrix (see Subresultant).\n\n"}

{"id": "2174527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174527", "title": "Curtiss-Wright CW-21", "text": "Curtiss-Wright CW-21\n\nThe Curtiss-Wright Model 21 (also known as the Curtiss-Wright Model 21 Demonstrator, the Curtiss-Wright CW-21 Interceptor, the Curtiss-Wright CW-21 Demon) was a United States-built fighter interceptor, developed by the St. Louis Airplane Division of Curtiss-Wright Corporation during the 1930s.\nIn 1938, George A. Page, head of the Saint Louis Airplane Division of Curtiss-Wright, decided to develop a fighter aircraft based on Carl W. Scott's two seater Model 19. Page's concept was a lightweight fighter interceptor with as high a rate of climb as possible in order to allow bomber formations to be attacked with minimal warning. If faced with fighter opposition, it was intended not to dogfight, but to use its superior climb rate to escape. While this was a direct contradiction to the United States Army Air Corps′ requirements for fighters (which stressed low-level performance), this did not concern Page, since the new fighter was intended for export.\n\nDetailed design of the new fighter, the Model 21, or CW-21, was carried out by a team led by chief engineer Willis Wells. It was a single-seat, all-metal cantilever low-wing monoplane with retractable tailwheel landing gear, where the mainwheels retracted rearwards into fairings under the wing. The fuselage was a semi-monocoque structure that tapered sharply behind the pilot's cockpit. It was powered by a Wright R-1820-G5 nine-cylinder air-cooled radial engine. It was designed to carry various combinations of two or machine guns, mounted in the nose and synchronized to fire through the propeller, while no armor or fuel tank protection was fitted in order to save weight and hence improve performance.\n\nThe prototype first flew on 22 September 1938, carrying the civil experimental registration \"NX19431\". Although the CW-21 was not commissioned by the U.S. military, it was test flown at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. The Army Air Corps immediately rejected the aircraft, with one officer commenting that it took a genius to land it.\n\nThe prototype CW-21 was delivered to China for evaluation by the Chinese Air Force. The Chinese were impressed by the CW-21's performance, and negotiation started on a Chinese purchase. While these negotiations were ongoing, the CW-21 prototype was flown in combat against Japanese bombers attacking Chungking, with Curtiss test pilot Bob Fausel claiming a Fiat BR.20 bomber shot down on 4 April 1939. In May 1939, a contract was signed, with China receiving the prototype and three complete examples built by Curtiss, as well as kits for 27 more aircraft. Assembly would be undertaken by the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company (CAMCO) at Loiwing, near the China-Burma border. These were to be armed with two and two machine guns.\n\nThe three Curtiss-built aircraft were shipped to China in May 1940 and were eventually handed over to the 1st American Volunteer Group (Flying Tigers), who intended to use them to tackle high-flying Japanese reconnaissance aircraft. These crashed and were destroyed, due to poor visibility, on a flight from Rangoon to Kunming on 23 December 1941. Of the 27 to be assembled by CAMCO, none were completed before CAMCO was forced by advancing Japanese forces to evacuate its Loiwing factory to India in 1942.\n\nCurtiss had meanwhile developed an improved version of the CW-21, the CW-21B. The main difference was a new undercarriage with inward-retracting mainwheels and a semi-retractable tail wheel which had been developed for the Curtiss-Wright CW-23 armed trainer, with other changes including hydraulically operated flaps. Although heavier, the CW-21B was faster than the original CW-21, albeit with a reduced rate of climb.\n\nIn April 1940, the Dutch Army Aviation Brigade \"Luchtvaartbrigade\", desperate for modern combat aircraft, placed an order for 24 CW-21Bs from Curtiss-Wright. After the Battle of the Netherlands, which resulted in the Dutch Army surrendering to the invading Germans on 15 May 1940, the order for the CW-21Bs (together with a number of Curtiss Model 75 fighters and Curtiss-Wright CW-22 trainers), was transferred to the government of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), for the \"Militaire Luchtvaart van het Koninklijk Nederlands-Indisch Leger\" (\"Military Aviation of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army\"; ML-KNIL).\n\nThe 24 CW-21Bs were assembled at Andir airfield, Bandung, Java, in February 1941, equipping \"Vliegtuiggroep IV, Afdeling 2\" (\"Air Group IV, No. 2 Squadron\"; \"2-VLG IV\"). The lightweight construction of the Curtiss-Wrights gave rise to structural problems, and several aircraft were grounded by cracks in the undercarriage, and were still awaiting repair when war with Japan began on 8 December 1941.\n\nWith its light construction, radial engine, low wing loading, limited pilot protection and lack of self-sealing fuel tanks, the CW-21B was the Allied fighter most similar to the opposing Japanese fighters. It had a rate of climb superior to the Nakajima Ki-43-I (\"Oscar\") and Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero. The CW-21B had similar firepower to the \"Oscar\", but worse than the cannon-armed Zero. \"2-VLG IV\" claimed four aerial victories during the Netherlands East Indies campaign, but the \"ML-KNIL\" was overwhelmed by the sheer number of Japanese aircraft; almost all of its fighters were soon lost in combat or destroyed on the ground.\n\n\n\nAfter the Dutch East Indies fell, the Japanese acquired at least one CW-21B, which was used as a liaison aircraft in the SE Asia area. Japanese photos were found showing it at the Tachikawa test center branch in Singapore. Photos show one CW-21B that was captured in excellent condition, along with a captured Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, and other Allied aircraft.\n\nCurtiss-Wright company records list a single CW-21A in the company's inventory until 1945. No additional information has been located, and its fate is unknown.\n\n"}
{"id": "2174529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174529", "title": "MP35", "text": "MP35\n\nThe MP35 (\"Maschinenpistole 35\", literally \"Machine Pistol 35\") was a submachine gun used by the Wehrmacht, Waffen-SS and German police both before and during World War II. It was developed in the early 1930s by Emil Bergmann (son of Theodor Bergmann) and manufactured at the Bergmann company in Suhl (that also built one of the first submachine guns, the MP 18).\n\nThe forerunner of the MP35 was the MP32 that Danish company Schultz & Larsen produced (under licence from the Bergmann company) and which was chambered for 9×23mm Bergmann ammunition. The BMP32 design was later updated by the Bergmann factory and in 1934, the Bergmann MP34 submachine gun appeared (not to be confused with different Steyr MP34). The limited manufacturing capabilities at the Bergmann plant required production to be shifted to Carl Walther's \"Zella-Mehlis\" plant. This German company produced some 2,000 BMP34s for export and domestic sales.\n\nSeveral variants of the BMP34 were manufactured with a 200mm standard or 320mm barrel. During 1935, a simplified version of the BMP34 designated as Bergmann MP35/I appeared. Initial production orders for MP35 were also placed at Walther, which made about 5,000 SMGs between 1936 and 1940.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, production once again shifted from Walter to Junker & Ruh (manufacture code 'ajf') to manufacture the MP35 weapon (which it did through to 1944). During the war, about 40,000 Bergmann submachine guns were produced by Junker, and almost all were supplied to the Waffen-SS.\n\nThe MP35 was a blowback operated, selective fire SMG which fired from an open bolt. The weapon featured a non-reciprocating cocking handle placed at the rear of the receiver, which was operated in a similar fashion to bolt-action on a Mauser rifle. This involved the weapon carrier to manually pull the handle up, pull backwards, push forwards and lock back down. When the gun was then fired the cocking handle remained stationary.\n\nOn the BMP32 the weapon featured a safety at the rear of the bolt (again in a similar location to the Mauser rifle). On both BMP34 and MP35 the safety was relocated to the left side of the receiver. The shooter could select the mode of firing by applying different pressure to the trigger – a short pull fired single shots; a long pull resulted in full automatic fire. Feed was from the right side of the gun, for some mysterious reason, with ejection to the left.\n\nIn contrast to many other SMGs of the time the MP35's magazine was inserted from the right-hand side of the weapon. Early versions used proprietary magazines, the BMP35 used Schmeisser MP28-compatible magazines. The barrel was enclosed into tubular jacket with cooling slots and muzzle brake/compensator at the front.\n\nIt was first known as the MP32 when adopted as such by the Danish Army in caliber 9×23mm Bergmann then as the MP34 (this not the same as the MP34 made by Steyr) when it was adopted by the Belgian Army as the Mitraillette 34.\n\nIt was adopted officially as MP35 by the Wehrmacht. It saw action predominantly with SS troops. In Yugoslavia, both the Partisans and the Chetniks used captured ex-German MP35s.\n\nThe MP35 was exported to Bolivia, Ethiopia, Spain and Sweden (where it was designated the number M39).\n\n"}

The rest of the cells are empty. \n\nThe goal is to connect all of the islands by drawing a series of bridges between the islands. The bridges must follow certain criteria:\n\n\nSolving a \"Hashiwokakero\" puzzle is a matter of procedural force: having determined where a bridge must be placed, placing it there can eliminate other possible places for bridges, forcing the placement of another bridge, and so on.\n\nAn island showing '3' in a corner, '5' along the outside edge, or '7' anywhere must have at least one bridge radiating from it in each valid direction, for if one direction did not have a bridge, even if all other directions sported two bridges, not enough will have been placed. Obviously, a '4' in a corner, '6' along the border, or '8' anywhere must have two bridges in each direction. This can be generalized as added bridges obstruct routes: a '3' that can only be travelled from vertically must have at least one bridge each for up and down, for example.\n\nIt is common practice to cross off or fill in islands whose bridge quota has been reached. In addition to reducing mistakes, this can also help locate potential \"short circuits\": keeping in mind that all islands must be connected by one network of bridges, a bridge that would create a closed network that no further bridges could be added to can only be permitted if it immediately yields the solution to the complete puzzle. The simplest example of this is two islands showing '1' aligned with each other; unless they are the only two islands in the puzzle, they cannot be connected by a bridge, as that would complete a network that cannot be added to, and would therefore force those two islands to be unreachable by any others.\n\nAny bridge that would completely isolate a group of islands from another group would not be permitted, as one would then have two groups of islands that could not connect. This deduction, however, is not very commonly seen in \"Hashiwokakero\" puzzles.\n\nDetermining whether a Hashiwokakero puzzle has a solution is NP-complete, by a reduction from finding Hamiltonian cycles in integer-coordinate unit distance graphs. There is a solution using integer linear programming in the MathProg examples included in GLPK.. A library of puzzles counting up to 400 islands as well as integer linear programming results are also reported.\n\n\"Hashiwokakero\" first appeared in Puzzle Communication Nikoli in issue #31 (September 1990), although an earlier form of the puzzle appeared in issue #28 (December 1989).\n\n\n"}

It has been described as \"international underground phenomenon\" by some, and racists by others. \n\nThe premise of the Brocket 99 tape was that of a fictitious radio station broadcasting from Brocket, Alberta, on the Northern Peigan reserve (a real First Nations reservation 70 km west of Lethbridge, Alberta), hosted by a character named \"Ernie Scar\" and featuring other participants.\n\nThe tape falsely stereotypes Canadian First Nations peoples through the use of pejorative, bigoted and racist terms as habitual users of alcohol, drugs and welfare, engaging in anti-social behavior and low in intelligence. The content of the tape is a mixture of music, advertisements, news, sports, interviews and local announcements divided into two parts corresponding to the two sides of a Cassette Tape in common use at the time. Music played on the tape included complete versions from AC/DC, Hank Williams Jr., The Romantics, Paul Revere & the Raiders, John Anderson (musician), Doctor and the Medics and Dwight Yoakam, although AC/DC is the most used artist throughout the tape. Advertisements on the tape were either original creations interspersed with vulgarity, racism and sterotypical language for real products such as for Lysol, or taken from legitimately produced radio commercials for companies such as Safeway, Penner's Men's and Women's Wear in Taber, Alberta and Beaver Lumber. News, sports, interviews and local announcements on the tape are largely original creations interspersed with factual entities such as the Seattle Seahawks and Toronto Blue Jays as well as non-existent entities such as \"Brocket Used Motors\" and \"Brocket Alcohol & Drug Abuse Hotline\" created specifically for the tape. It is unconfirmed though realistically impossible that any of the music or produced or original advertising content for any of the businesses referred to in the tape would have authorized their use during the production of the tape, owing to the stereotypical and racist content used by the tape's creators.\n\nThe tape was created in 1986 by Tim Hitchner, a radio DJ in Lethbridge, Alberta as a parody and not intended to be marketed. . Hitchner worked as a radio DJ at CHEC, CKTA, and CKIZ-FM from 1985 to 1992. It is claimed that Hitchner was inspired to create Brocket 99 based on another underground tape circulating in 1986 called \"AIDS Radio\" that was a spoof of a homosexual radio station using stereotypical and bigoted references. The initial method of distribution from Tim Hitchner has not been documented, although its wider distribution has been described as viral. The tape has been described as an \"international underground phenomenon\".\n\nHitchner died February 12, 2011. On February 12, 2011, a fan site reported the then anonymous actor who played Ernie Scar had died at age 49, of myocardial infarction due to coronary artery disease. CKIZ's list of past employees on its website currently identifies Hitchner as the voice of Ernie Scar.\n\nIn 2005, filmmaker Nilesh Patel produced and directed a documentary called \"Brocket 99 — Rockin' the Country\", which examined the ongoing popularity of the tape and the relationship between aboriginal people and others in Canada.\n\nThe film won the Séquences Magazine Prize for best documentary film at the 2006 Montreal First Peoples Festival.\n\nIn 2004, prior to the release of the documentary, Mark Campbell of Global News interviewed Nilesh Patel to discuss the creation and subject matter of the documentary. In addition to discussing prevailing Canadian attitudes on race and culture in the context of the documentary, Nilesh Patel also made an unsubstantiated claim during the interview that Mark Campbell was in denial of being the creator of Brocket 99. Contrary to this claim, no evidence has ever been presented implicating any individual other than Tim Hitchner in the creation of or participation in Brocket 99. On February 15, 2015, Mark Campbell wrote a blog post confirming again that he was neither the creator of nor a participant in Brocket 99.\n\n\n"}

Stevie Moore or RSM, is an American multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter who pioneered lo-fi/DIY music. Often called the \"godfather of home recording\", he is one of the most recognized artists of the cassette underground, and his influence is particularly felt in the bedroom and hypnagogic pop artists of the post-millennium. Since 1968, he has self-released approximately 400 albums, while about three dozen \"official\" albums (largely compilations) have been issued on various labels.\n\nBorn the son of Nashville A-Team bassist Bob Moore, Steven grew up in the 1960s listening to the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Mothers of Invention, and Jimi Hendrix. On his 16th birthday, he received a four-track reel-to-reel tape deck and began recording as a one-man band in his parents' basement in suburban Madison, Tennessee. The innovative manipulation of low fidelity recording processes in his early albums defined his general aesthetic. With help from his uncle, he made his official label debut with 1976's \"Phonography\", which was well-received in New York's punk and new wave circles. Although he is best known for \"'60s-inspired power pop in the XTC vein,\" his body of work incorporates a variety of music genres, both popular and experimental, and his records are typically styled after freeform radio. He describes his prolific output as \"a diary of sound\".\n\nFrom 1978 until 2010, Moore lived and recorded in his apartment studios in northern New Jersey. He was also a WFMU staff member for a number of years. In 1982, he launched the R. Stevie Moore Cassette Club, his home-based mailing service. Throughout the 1980s, the French label New Rose released a series of Moore albums: \"Everything\" (1984), \"Glad Music\" (1986), \"Teenage Spectacular\" (1987), and \"Warning\" (1988). After the 2000s, he became better known for his associations with Ariel Pink, who frequently praised Moore as his \"mentor\".\n\nRobert Steven Moore was born in Nashville, Tennessee on January 18, 1952. His father, Bob Moore (born 1932), was a session musician associated with the Nashville A-Team conglomerate who worked as a bassist for Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Bob Dylan. Steven characterized his father as a \"terrible\" parent and said that \"It was a very intense, dramatic, abusive childhood, with all this money coming in, because he’s doing these amazing historical sessions. It’s very, very sad. He was very disappointed in me because I was not a get-up-and-go type.\" At the age of seven, Steven made his commercial recording debut singing a duet with country recording artist Jim Reeves, \"But You Love Me, Daddy\". The novelty song was withheld from commercial release until 1969, when it became a hit single in the UK on the RCA Victor label. Moore's mother Betty was from Paterson, New Jersey.\n\nAs a teenager, Moore became proficient on guitar, bass, piano, and drums. He was self-taught. In 1966, he and a few high-school friends formed a short-lived rock combo called the Marlborough. His recordings in this period were heavily influenced by the Mothers of Invention's albums \"Freak Out!\" (1966) and \"We're Only in It for the Money\" (1967). He found particular inspiration from albums that are \"just all over the map … Zappa leaned into parody, and I’m all about that. I love humor.\" On his 16th birthday, he received a four-track reel-to-reel tape deck and began recording as a one-man band set up in his parents' basement in suburban Madison. The first album he completed and self-released was a mixture of Beatles-inspired songs and sound collages titled \"On Graycroft\" (1968). Much of his output, he later said, was \"uncontrollable—compelled without compulsion. I didn't seek out to do this. It just came out of me. I had this music inside of me and I wanted to be a pop star. It was like a disease that I had to record and write.\" Over the years he would describe himself as \"a huge record collector and music historian\" with interests ranging from beatnik and avant-garde to noise and jazz: \"I love attempts at all genres and styles – even if I fail. It doesn’t matter.\"\n\nMoore began working as a studio musician and assistant at his father's music publishing company, Mimosa Music. His father expected him to \"follow in his footsteps, to become a wealthy country session picker. My personal interests couldn't have been more opposite than that.\" He briefly attended Vanderbilt University, but dropped out in 1971 to pursue his passions for writing, recording and performing music. That same year, he moved out of his parent's house and rented an apartment at the Music Row area in Nashville. He formed a close friendship with next-door neighbor Victor Lovera, who he called \"one of my best friends and ... very influential for my songwriting.\"\n\nThroughout the early 1970s, Moore continued to play local shows with a group of high-school friends whose band name changed frequently. His music tastes—which mainly encompassed artists like the Beach Boys, the Move, Frank Zappa, and Todd Rundgren—were mostly out of step with the prevailing music culture in Nashville. In 1973, Moore, Lovera, and friends Roger Ferguson and Billy Anderson recorded original material at the local Audio Media recording studio under the band name \"Ethos\", which was left unreleased at the time. Engineer Paul Whitehead remembered of those sessions: \"Moore [would] perform on ANY instrument with total control and an energy that I have never witnessed in a studio. I thought the world of Victor's unique vocal sound and thought the two of them would be wildly successful, but as I told them they would have to move to New York to even get noticed.\"\n\nIn 1975, Moore was commissioned by his uncle Harry \"H.P.\" Palmer (an executive of Atco Records) to record an album of Beatles instrumentals, \"Stevie Does the Beatles\", but plans for an official release fell through. Palmer continued to encourage Moore to put his music out, and in 1976, \"Phonography\" was Moore's first album to be released on an outside label (Palmer's HP Music). Technically a compilation, the LP was assembled by Palmer using material from Moore's previous two years of home recording, with its contents split between pop songs and spoken-word interludes. Its initial run was limited to 100 pressings.\n\n\"Phonography\" was reviewed in New York's \"Trouser Press\" as \"an outrageous collection of musical brain spewage\" and \"a true slash of genius\". Moore credits the review's author, Ira Robbins, as \"the one who helped turn people on to \"Phonography\" and those early independent records.\" The album soon attracted praise from within New York's punk and new wave circles. HP Music followed up with the EP \"Stance\" (recorded 1976–77) and the LP \"Delicate Tension\" (recorded 1976–78), both released 1978. Dominique Leone of \"Pitchfork\" wrote that \"Phonography\" and other albums from this time ultimately \"defined his aesthetic: a mixture of Anglo-powered pop, Zappa-esque instrumentals, lo-fi experimental sound design, and other music that defies categorization.\" \"Phonography\" later became the best-known album of his career and was listed among \"the fifty most significant indie records\" in \"Rolling Stone\"s \"Alt-Rock-A-Rama\" (1996).\n\nIn February 1978, Moore relocated to Montclair, New Jersey and got a job working at a Sam Goody record store in Livingston, where he remained for many years. According to him, although he lived 13 miles away from the Lincoln Tunnel in the proceeding decades, he rarely ever traveled into New York City. He said he arrived in New Jersey \"right when punk was hitting, and I was an instant celebrity. I bleached my hair and I spiked it out, and I was Johnny Rotten from hillbilly land. It was so innocent then, total lo-fi.\" Over the decade, he made sporadic appearances on the public access television variety show \"The Uncle Floyd Show\". He was also a staff member on the New Jersey-based independent radio station WFMU, where he hosted a weekly \"Bedroom Radio\" show for about \"four or five years\" and claimed to be \"one of the first that did radio shows that would play Wagner, then The Sex Pistols, then hillbilly, then great funk.\"\n\nMoore later reflected on this period: \"I'm not a nightlife person. I should have really planted myself on the streets and plugged away, but I'm not a very good salesman so I never thought of going down and trying to convince people to sign me. It was a struggle. ... Through the 80s, my uncle was hoping I’d get a band together, but I had no idea how to do it.\" In late 1979, he used an eight-track Manhattan studio to record \"Clack!\" (1980), named for the studio's owner Tom Clack. It was Moore's first album recorded in a professional studio. At this point, he was heavily influenced by Public Image Ltd: \"[they] changed my life! That whole postpunk thing, minimalist dub, drums and bass. It almost sounds like fragments, not finished songs. I loved that music.\" The album also marked the beginning of Moore's \"post-punk era\", which lasted until 1983's \"Crises\". In the early 1980s, the tracks \"Bloody Knuckles\" and \"Chantilly Lace\" from \"Clack!\" saw some college radio airplay. WFMU's Irwin Chusid also performed with Moore as a drummer and compiled the \"What's The Point?!!\" (1984), the first record issued on the label Cuneiform.\n\nIn 1982, he launched the R. Stevie Moore Cassette Club, a mail-order service that issued his recordings on cassette. He acknowledged the number of albums he made available: \"People tell me I'm shooting myself in the foot, releasing so much — I've heard that for years. But I can't help it. It's who I am.\" Music critic Richie Unterberger, in an essay about the developing cassette culture, wrote that he subsequently became \"one of the most famous\" artists associated with the movement. Between 1984 and 1988, the French label New Rose issued four of his albums on vinyl, starting with \"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About R. Stevie Moore (But Were Afraid to Ask)\". The album, a double-disc retrospective, proved briefly popular in France, with a single \"Chantilly Lace\" from the album becoming a minor sleeper hit there, and prompting Moore to undertake a promotional visit to the country. The remaining albums—\"Glad Music\" (1986), \"Teenage Spectacular\" (1987), and \"Warning: R. Stevie Moore\" (1988)—were mostly recorded using professional studios.\n\nMoore continued to produce music and play gigs throughout the 1990s and 2000s. By 1999, the cassette club had become the R. Stevie Moore CD-R Club (CDRSMCLUB), and in 2005, he reported that there was about 100 dedicated fans who bought his music on a monthly basis; \"They love getting product directly from the artist. Around 70 percent are in the States and about 30 percent in [Europe] ... Sometimes they'll disappear, and then come back five years later.\" In 2002, he recorded an album with Half Japanese frontman Jad Fair, titled \"FairMoore\", described as \"a lovely, heartfelt effort that shows both in top form\" by critic Dave Mandl, who wrote that it \"brings together two fiercely original figures in the American music underground\", the album consisting of Fair reciting his poetry over Moore's instrumental backing. The 2009 compilation \"Me Too\", issued on Cherry Red Records, was annotated by Dave Gregory of XTC.\n\nMoore relocated back to his native Nashville in December 2010. In 2011, he established a new band with guitarist J.R. Thomason and embarked on his first ever tours, including Europe. He said: \"Things are just exploding left and right and I can’t keep up with it all. I need management. It’s a great problem to have, but I can’t take advantage of it. I’m just one person. It’s crazy.\" The world tour was made possible by a crowd-funded Kickstarter campaign and lasted for the next two years.\n\nIn November 2012, Moore traveled to Los Angeles and recorded material with Jason Falkner, formerly of Jellyfish. Their collaboration produced the 2015 album \"Make It Be\". In 2017, the album was given an official release through Bar/None Records and was met with generally favorable reviews. That April, Moore and Falker appeared together for a one-off performance at the South by Southwest music festival. Moore reflected that he had to stop his worldwide touring due to \"health issues that are worsening,\" adding that his career \"started takin' off ... way too late in life\" and that he had recently \"given up making proper rock and pop, rock and roll music. I just kinda maintain my back catalog, I don’t record much anymore.\"\n\nIn 2019, Bar/None released \"Afterlife\", a compilation of Moore tracks that were recorded at professional studios between 2006 and 2013. The album also features contributions from Ariel Pink, Jason Falkner, and Lane Steinberg. Most of the selections are remakes of decades-plus old songs. Moore said that the \"final album playlist was purposefully kept safe, clean and more hi-fi mainstreamy, without my usual quirky left turns and lo-fi inserts.\" On December 31, he announced his retirement via his website. He wrote that he would offer \"absolutely no further song writing, recording, performing, travelling, [or] interviews.\"\n\nAllMusic's Stewart Mason summarized Moore's body of work as a \"one of a kind\" mixture of \"classic pop influences, arty experimentalism, idiosyncratic lyrics, wild stylistic left turns, and homemade rough edges.\" However, \"entire generations of lo-fi enthusiasts and indie trailblazers, from Guided by Voices to the Apples in Stereo, owe much to [his] pioneering in the field.\" In the liner notes of \"Me Too\", XTC member Dave Gregory stated that Moore was \"a seriously underrated maverick talent, the Neil Young of the real underground ... his lyrics are intelligent and/or downright funny, he knows how to string a sequence of chords together and he has a gift for melody that many a more 'successful' songwriter would envy.\" He worked with Moore on a remake of Moore's \"Dates\" in 1999. XTC founder Andy Partridge echoed of Moore's work: \"What beauty, what invention.\"\n\nA wider recognition of Moore's music came in the late 2000s as a result of newer acts who cited him as an influence. In particular, there was Ariel Pink, who initiated a correspondence with Moore earlier in the decade and recorded some collaborations. Pink's own work shared much of the same musical approaches, although Moore denies that they sound similar. Moore's exposure grew alongside Pink's solo success as he was repeatedly championed by Pink in various press interviews. In 2005, Pink contributed a song to Moore's \"Conscientious Objector\" compilation. He told a journalist around this era that he was \"trying to like, reverse time. I'm trying to get Todd Hyman to reissue him on Acute. Then it can get like, the David-Fricke-fuckin'-\"Rolling Stone\" treatment. It's about time. It's criminal that he's not well known. Especially in light of the fact that I'm getting attention. ... \"Mojo\" has never even printed a word about him. \"Uncut\", never a word.\" In 2006, Pink curated the Moore retrospective \"Ariel Pink's Picks Vol. 1\", and in 2012, the duo released the collaborative album \"Ku Klux Glam\".\n\nWhen a 2006 \"New York Times\" article referenced Moore as the progenitor of \"bedroom pop\", he responded that the notion was \"hilarious to me. I guess because of my age, because of my bitter struggle to make a living and get some notoriety, I scoff at it. ... A lot of the music coming out of these bedrooms is not even interesting, not worthy of being heard. But some of it will be.\" Moore also hesitated to be associated with the \"outsider music\" tag, explaining that while he \"loves\" artists like Wesley Willis and Daniel Johnston, \"they have no concept as to how to write or arrange a Brian Wilson song.\" In 2012, \"The Wire\"s Matthew Ingram argued that \"[h]is echoes can be heard in the music of artists like Pavement, Smog, Guided By Voices and Beck, and through his disciple Ariel Pink, he has unwittingly provided the template for the entire movement currently known as Hypnagogic Pop.\" Tim Burrows of \"Dazed Digital\" similarly noted that \"with a little help from James Ferraro and a few others, Moore and Pink can be credited with influencing [the] whole [genre of] hypnagogic pop.\"\n\nDue to his prolific output, the majority of Moore's CD and vinyl releases have been career-spanning compilations. He noted having \"sort of ... two discographies: my own that contains all of my self-released material and the official releases, which are what record labels decided to put out over the years.\" During a 1984 appearance on \"The Scott and Gary Show\", he stated that he had 109 releases in total. In 2012, his Bandcamp page listed over 200 releases.\n\nAlthough it is often reported that his complete discography exceeds 400 albums, Moore said that the estimate was not an \"actual proven number\" and that \"400 might seem stretching it a bit, [but] when it comes down to every bit of home taping I’ve ever done, including producing friends, alternate dub versions, session discs, audio verite ephemera, etcetera, it suddenly becomes an unlimited guess.\" In response to this Wikipedia article, which formerly stated that the count was \"at least 200\", Moore requested fans on his website to tally a more accurate estimate. In February 2018, he received a count of 354 releases listed on his \"tapelist\" page (including video and live recordings), 391 on his \"albums list\" page, and 344 on Bandcamp.\nOfficial studio albums\n\nSelected compilations\n\nFurther reading\n"}

He won the 1886 Open Championship and finished second in the 1903 U.S. Open. In total, he had twelve top-10 finishes in major championship tournaments.\n\nBrown was born on 9 May 1861 in Musselburgh, Scotland. He was a roofing slater by trade and a keen golfer. In 1886, he was working in Musselburgh when The Open Championship was about to be played. John Anderson, who was secretary of the Musselburgh Club at the time, invited him to play and provided him with a pair of striped trousers, a frock coat and a lum hat to wear. He shocked the professionals by winning the tournament by two shots from Willie Campbell, carding rounds of 38-41-37-41=157, and then turned professional himself.\n\nBrown was hired by Hayling Island Golfing Club (now Hayling Golf Club) in early 1885 as greenkeeper following the departure of Joseph Lloyd as Professional/Greenkeeper where \"The Field\" reported in an April report of the Spring Meeting of that year that 'great satisfaction was expressed at the improvement made in the state of the green since the charge of it was undertaken by David Brown of Musselburgh'. Brown moved permanently to England to become club professional at Newbiggin by the Sea Golf Club in about 1888, and later worked at Malvern Club. He played in the Open Championship regularly and featured prominently. At the turn of the century he moved to Boston in the United States. In 1903 he tied with Willie Anderson for first place in the U.S. Open after 72 holes, but he lost the playoff. Brown enjoyed playing the stock market but lost most of his wealth during the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and returned to Musselburgh, where he died in 1936.\n\nBrown died on 8 July 1936 in Inveresk, Scotland.

Ontario Hydro's Plan to Serve Customers' Electricity Needs\" was a four-volume 1989 study to the year 2014 by Ontario Hydro, the then supplier of electric power for the province of Ontario, Canada. The general public of Ontario was provided with copies of this report free of charge, and ask for feedback.\n\nThe report explained why Ontario needed an electricity plan. It analyzed the people using electricity, a flexible system for serving customers, priority resources to meet needs, choosing the best major supply options, finding a balanced solution, and it added a glossary about electricity.\n\nThe report was part of what was known as the \"25-year plan\". The report was intended to stimulate discussion of the various goals and methods to meet the objectives of Ontario Hydro. One purpose of the overall 25-year plan was to ensure there would be enough electricity to meet the growing demand at a price which would maintain various industries within their operating territory. Many opponents did not have sufficient resources to present their opposition in a business fashion and Ontario Hydro was mandated to provide financial resources to some opposing groups. One significant finding by an opposition group was that the report omitted defining the overall health effects of the presented options.\n\nThis report, in colour, with tables and graphs, went into details on the amount of electricity that was expected to be demanded from the electricity supply system every year until 2014, and showed how much additional generating capacity would have to be provided to meet that demand. For example, on page 3-15 is a table showing that, as an estimate, there is only a 10% probability that less than 28.6 gigawatts (GW) will be needed as peak in 2005, 29.0 GW in 2006, 29.6 GW in 2007, and 33.5 GW in 2014. The report went into great detail about what the needs were anticipated to be, defined resources, and examined various alternative plans (How much nuclear? Fossil fuel? Minimum pollution? Least expensive? Matters of politics? etc.) to ensure sufficient electricity would be available when it was needed in Ontario, considering not only the additional demand, but also the expected retirements before 2015 of older generating facilities.\n\nAppendix A was about strategy (March 1989), Appendix B provides a list of references, and Appendix C is a glossary, including commonly used acronyms.\n\nAs a result of the recession of the early 1990s, power demand stopped rising at the historical rate for several years. As a result, the plan was perceived to be overly ambitious and the environmental assessment required to review it was eventually abandoned. Ontario Hydro essentially stopped any further future planning and concentrated on running its existing assets. As a result, in the early years of the 21st century, Ontario was suffering from inadequate domestic power supplies and had to import power from other utilities.\n\nThe record, so up to July 15, 2005, was 26,170 megawatts (MW)\n. Ontario had to purchase 3400 megawatts at up to seven times the normal rate, according to Metro of July 19 quoting the Torstar News Service, to meet the peak demand. Unfunded electricity debt so far is $20.6 billion, with Ontario's household consumers being charged only 5 cents per kilowatt hour for the first 750 kilowatt hours, and only 5.8 cents for the remainder.

Rashida Tlaib criticized Tapper for \"comparing Palestinian human rights advocates to terrorist white nationalists,\" calling it \"fundamentally a lie.\" In response, Tapper said that \"those who believe Palestinian leaders bear responsibility for the incitement of terrorism cannot then let US leaders off the hook and act as if words don't matter\". \n\nTapper has contributed to \"GQ\", \"The Weekly Standard\", NPR's \"All Things Considered\", \"The New York Times\", and \"The Washington Post\". In 2001, he hosted the program \"Take Five\" on CNN, in which young journalists and commentators discussed politics and pop culture. In 2002, he hosted a series of entertainment news specials on VH1, and in 2003 he hosted shows focused on independent film on the Sundance Channel. Tapper has also been a guest on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\", \"The Colbert Report\", \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\", \"Conan\", \"The View\", \"Real Time with Bill Maher\", and appeared on the \"Judge John Hodgman\" podcast as guest bailiff, standing in for regular bailiff Jesse Thorn during the August 31, 2011 episode entitled \"De Plane\".\n\nOn April 24, 2018, Little, Brown and Company published Tapper's first novel, a political thriller entitled \"The Hellfire Club\". The novel follows a fictitious freshman Congressman discovering corruption and conspiracy in 1950s Washington, at the height of the McCarthy era. The book debuted at Number 3 on the New York Times Best-Seller List for Hardcover fiction, and remained on the Best-Seller list for four weeks total. The Associated Press called \"The Hellfire Club\" \"insightful...well-written and worthwhile.\" Tablet Magazine called the novel \"startlingly good.\" \"USA Today\" said the author \"sizzles\" and \"proves he has the page-turning knack in his entertaining debut novel.\"\n\nTapper is also the author of \"The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor\", a critically acclaimed book about U.S. troops in Afghanistan that debuted at number 10 on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list for hardback non-fiction. Bob Woodward described the book as \"Brilliant, dedicated reporting by a journalist who goes to ground to get the truth. A sad, real tale about this war, America and the brave warriors who live—and die—at the point of the spear\" and Jon Krakauer called it \"a mind-boggling, all-too-true story of heroism, hubris, failed strategy, and heartbreaking sacrifice. If you want to understand how the war in Afghanistan went off the rails, you need to read this book.\" In 2014, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society recognized Tapper for the book and his reporting on military topics in general with the Tex McCrary Award for Excellence in Journalism. A Rod Lurie-directed film adaptation of \"The Outpost\" is in pre-production, starring Milo Gibson, Orlando Bloom, Scott Eastwood and Caleb Landry Jones.\n\nIn addition to \"The Outpost\", Tapper is the author of \"Down and Dirty: The Plot to Steal the Presidency\", based on the 2000 Presidential election, that \"The Washington Post\" called \"lively\", the \"Chicago Tribune\" \"a churning effusion well worth reading\" and \"The Daily Telegraph\" \"engrossing\". He also wrote \"Body Slam: The Jesse Ventura Story\" (St. Martin's Press) that was excerpted by \"The Washington Post Magazine\".\n\nHis comic strip \"Capitol Hell\" appeared in \"Roll Call\" from 1994 to 2003. He has also contributed cartoons to \"The American Spectator\" magazine, the \"Los Angeles Times\", and \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\". During the week of May 23, 2016, Tapper guest illustrated the \"Dilbert\" cartoon. The original drawings were auctioned online to raise money for the Homes for our Troops Foundation.\n\nAs the Senior White House Correspondent for ABC News, Tapper was honored with three Merriman Smith Memorial Awards for broadcast journalism. The first Merriman Smith Memorial Award was for reporting noncompliance of laws regulating tax reporting by the Department of Health and Human Services secretary nominee and former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle (D-SD), troubles that ultimately derailed Daschle's nomination. The second was for the 2010 story that President Obama had asked for the resignation of his Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Dennis C. Blair (retired). The third time was for breaking the 2011 story that the ratings agency Standard and Poor's was expected to downgrade the AAA rating for U.S. government debt. As a CNN anchor, he was awarded his fourth Merriman Smith Award in 2018 as part of a team that broke the news that President-elect Donald Trump and President Barack Obama had been briefed on the now infamous dossier alleging that Russia had blackmail material on Donald Trump.\n\nIn 2017, Tapper won several awards, including the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Political Journalism.

{"id": "2174563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174563", "title": "Umayyah ibn Khalaf", "text": "Umayyah ibn Khalaf\n\nUmayyah ibn Khalaf ibn Safwan (L.A)', whose \"kunya\" was Abu Ali, or Abu Safwan, was a Meccan Arab, a leading member of the Quraish and head of Bani Jumah. He was an opponent of the Muslims led by Muhammad and is best known as the master of Bilal ibn Rabah, a slave he tortured for converting to Islam.\n\nOther transliterations of his name include Umayya, Umaya, Umaiiya and Umaiya.\n\nHe was the son of Khalaf ibn Safwan ibn Habib ibn Wahb ibn Hudhafah ibn Jumah and brother of Ubaydullah ibn Khalaf. He married thrice. By his wife, Safiya bint Ma'mar ibn Habib, he had some sons; Safwan, Ahyah, and Salamah. By his wife, Karima bint Ma'mar ibn Habib, he had some sons; Walid and Ali (who were both slain at Badr), Rabi'ah, Muslim, Ma'bad and Mas'ud. By his wife Layla bint Habib al-Tamimiyya from B.Tamim, he had a daughter, named al-Taw'ama bint Umayya. \n\nUmayyah was involved in the pagan religious ceremonies of Mecca, where he distributed perfume in the square of the Kaaba.\n\nAfter Muhammad began to preach against idolatry, Umayyah became a staunch opponent of the new teaching. He subjected his slave Bilal ibn Ribah to torture for having adopted Islam. He forced Bilal to lie on hot desert sand and pinned him down with a heavy stone on his chest. When Bilal still refused to denounce Islam, a heavy person was to jump on the stone. Bilal kept repeating, \"\"Ahad! Ahad!\"\" (One God! One God!)\n\nUmmayah had a close friend named Abdul Rahman ibn Awf, but their friendship was strained when Abdu Amr converted to Islam. Abdu Amr changed his name to Abd al-Rahman and later emigrated to Medina.\n\nBecause of their friendship, the two formed a written agreement, according to which Abdul Rahman was to protect Umayah's property and/or family in Medina, while Umayyah would protect Abd-al-Rahman's in Mecca. When Abd al-Rahman's name was mentioned in the document, Umayyah protested, saying \"I do not know Ar-Rahman\" and requested that the pre-Islamic name \"Abdu Amr\" should be used, to which Abd al-Rahman yielded.\n\nUmayyah was also an good friend of Sa'd ibn Mua'dh, the leader of the Banu Aus . When Umayyah was in Medina on his way to Syria, he used to stay with Sa'd and when Sa'd was in Mecca, he used to stay with Umayah.\n\nPrior to the Battle of Badr, Sa'd visited Mecca once to perform his Umrah with Umayyah, when they came across Abu Jahl. They had an argument, and as it became heated, Sa'd threatened Abu Jahl with stopping the Meccan trade route to Syria and informed Umayyah that his life was threatened by Muhammad.\n\nIn March 624 the Meccans decided to confront the Muslim forces that threatened a caravan from Syria led by Abu Sufyan ibn Harb. Abu Jahl rallied the people for war, saying, \"Go and protect your caravan.\" \n\nUmayyah, who was anxious about Sa'd's warning, did not want to leave Mecca; but Abu Jahl said to him: \"O Abu Safwan! If the people see you staying behind, though you are the chief of the people of the Valley, then they will remain behind with you.\" Abu Jahl urged until Umayyah said, \"As you have forced me to change my mind, I will buy the best camel in Mecca.\" Umayyah told his wife: \"O Umm Safwan, prepare what I need [for the journey].\" She said to him, \"O Abu Safwan! Have you forgotten what your Yathribi brother told you?\" He said, \"No, but I do not want to go with them but for a short distance.\" When Umayyah went out, he tied his camel wherever he camped.\n\nBattle was joined on 13 March 624. During the battle, Umayyah was captured by his old friend Abdul Rahman ibn Awf. He was killed by a group of Muslims led by his former slave Bilal (who was a victim of his earlier torture), in spite of Abdul Rahman's protests and his attempt to shield Umayyah with his own body. His son Ali was also killed at Badr while defending his father.\n"}
{"id": "2174565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174565", "title": "Sprucefield", "text": "Sprucefield\n\nSprucefield is a major out-of-town retail park in the townland of Lisburn, County Down, Northern Ireland. It is on the southern edge of Lisburn; about one mile from Lisburn city centre, and ten miles (16 km) from central Belfast. Sprucefield is located beside the M1 motorway and the A1 road. It is split in two parts: the Sprucefield Centre and Sprucefield Park.\n\nSprucefield is also the site of the Lisnagarvey transmitting station.\n\nSprucefield Centre was developed by Marks and Spencer on the site of Lisnagarvey Hockey Club and opened in March 1989. The proximity to the radio transmitter required the centre to be built as a Faraday cage to protect electronic equipment from the mast's electromagnetic field. Sprucefield Centre includes shops such as Marks and Spencer, Next, Pets At Home and Boots.\n\nThe centre was virtually destroyed in January 1991 in an IRA incendiary attack. Three of four stores were destroyed, (MFI, Allied Maples and Texas), while the Marks and Spencer wing suffered only water damage.\n\nAn expansion of Marks and Spencer has been reported for many years. An outline planning application was submitted in 1995, followed by a public inquiry in 1999. The Planning Service recommended the proposal be accepted. If built the extension calls for the demolition and resiting of the transmitter station, although these plans never went ahead. In August 2007, Marks and Spencer opened a large homeware section (second largest in the UK after Manchester) on the Sprucefield site in what had been the adjoining Homebase shop. Homebase's lease on the building was not renewed by M&S who own the entire complex. M&S also upgraded its anchor store with a new café, better lighting and customer friendly walkways. The expansion of their Sprucefield store makes it the largest store in Ireland and the third largest in the United Kingdom. In April 2016 Marks and Spencer reported that their Lisburn Sprucefield store recorded the highest food sales of any of their UK stores making it the most profitable store in the M&S network.\n\nSprucefield Park was opened in 2003, with Sainsbury's and B&Q as anchor tenants. There are four smaller units, occupied by Currys, Argos, and Next Home. The 21,500m (231,426 ft) project was managed by a Stannifer/Snoddons Construction joint venture. Stannifer is a British property development company, while the latter is a construction company based in Hillsborough, County Down. Construction was carried out by McLaughlin & Harvey. Stannifer took ownership of the site, while it retained a 50% share of the proposed second phase. In 2004 The Westfield Group acquired Stannifer's parent (Chelsfield) and took control of the company's shares in Sprucefield Park.\n\nSprucefield Park (like the Sprucefield Centre) has faced major objections at almost every stage. Sainsbury's announced its move into Northern Ireland on 20 June 1995 and opened its first stores in 1997, however it would be eight years before its Sprucefield store was opened. An application for outline planning permission was submitted in July 1998 and final permission was granted in February 2001. The planning permission for the centre also included a multiplex cinema and a 150-bed hotel, however these have yet to be built. Lisnagarvey Hockey Club, which sold its pitches to Marks and Spencer for its development in 1989, had again to relocate when it sold its pitches to the developers of Sprucefield Park.\n\nIn December 2004 the B&Q store was extensively damaged by an incendiary device. The store was closed for approximately six months. In January 2005 another firebomb was discovered in the centre's Sainsbury's store, however this was successfully defused. Both incidents, and others such as the destruction of a Next store at Forestside Shopping Centre in Belfast, were blamed on dissident republicans.\n\nIn September 2015 B&Q announced that its Sprucefield branch was one of five Northern Ireland stores that it will close.\n\nIn June 2004 the developers announced plans for a John Lewis department store and 29 additional units on the site. Despite objections from Lisburn retailers and the Belfast Chamber of Commerce the development was given approval in June 2005 by then Northern Ireland Environment Minister Jeff Rooker. However, in October 2005 six parties opposed to the development won the right to seek a judicial review of the planning permission. These parties were Belfast City Council, Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce, Lisburn Chamber of Commerce, the owners of Lisburn's Bow Street Mall, Central Craigavon Limited and AM Developments Limited (AM Developments is building the Victoria Square centre in Belfast city centre). On 10 May 2006 the appeal was upheld, effectively removing planning permission. However the judge, Mr Justice Girvan, said he was not ruling on the merits of the store itself, rather on the way the decision to grant permission was taken. This allowed a new planning application to be submitted.\n\nWestfield and Snoddens' reaffirmed their commitment to pursuing planning permission in November 2006 after a new legal challenge by Central Craigavon Ltd., owners of the Rushmere Shopping Centre. Westfield detailed its new planning application on 26 August 2008. The number of additional retail units planned was reduced from 29 to 19, however the developers conceded that the proposal is \"ostensibly the same\" at a total floor space of approximately 50,000 square metres (540,000 sq ft).\n\nIn March 2014 Westfield agreed to sell Sprucefield Park to Intu Properties plc for £70 million.\n\n"}
{"id": "2174566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174566", "title": "Goodrich Quality Theaters", "text": "Goodrich Quality Theaters\n\nGoodrich Quality Theaters (GQT, formerly GQTI) is a chain of 31 movie theaters, headquartered in Grand Rapids, MI, representing a total of 287 screens in the United States. The majority of GQT's locations are in Michigan, but other locations can be found in Florida, Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri. The company filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in February 2020. All employees were terminated March 19th, 2020 without notice. \n\nThe first IMAX screens operated by Goodrich Quality Theaters were unveiled in early 2007. After undergoing renovations, Randall 15 IMAX in Batavia, Illinois featured an IMAX screen, as does Portage 16 IMAX in Portage, Indiana.\n\nOpening in March 2008, Hamilton 16 IMAX + GDX in Noblesville, Indiana was the third GQT location with an IMAX while adding two Giant Digital Experience (GDX) auditoriums in 2016 featuring Dolby Atmos sound. Savoy 16 near Champaign, Illinois underwent renovations and opened an IMAX auditorium on May 3, 2013, to make the fourth IMAX location for Goodrich Quality Theaters.\n\nAll of GQT's screens were converted to digital in the Fall of 2011. Every GQT location features one or more screens equipped with 3D technology, either in RealD 3D or MasterImage 3D.\n\nAt the same time, GQT has stepped into the restaurant industry with Features Gastropub in Gibsonton, Florida, a suburb of Tampa.\n\nBob Goodrich, the owner and president of Goodrich Quality Theaters, also owns and operates AM 1680 WPRR Public Reality Radio in Grand Rapids, MI.\n\nOn February 28, 2020, Goodrich Quality Theaters filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.\n\nThe origins of Goodrich Quality Theaters can be traced back to 1930, when William Goodrich left his family's rubber manufacturing business in order to purchase the Savoy Theatre in downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan. Previously, the Savoy Theatre had been a vaudeville theater; Goodrich renovated it as a single-screen movie theater and opened it in 1931 with \"All Quiet on the Western Front\". Business at the theater prospered, largely due to Goodrich's cheap double features. For just 15 cents, patrons could watch the main feature, followed by a B-Movie. By comparison, the average price for a movie ticket nationwide hovered between 23 and 25 cents during the 1930s.\n\nThe Savoy was later converted into a two-screen theater and finally shut down in 1979. William Goodrich also operated the Majestic Theatre in Grand Rapids, which was later sold and currently exists as the Meijer Majestic Theatre, owned by the Grand Rapids Civic Theatre.\n\nControl of the company was handed down to William's son, Bob Goodrich, who still heads Goodrich Quality Theaters. Bob Goodrich extensively expanded the company, founding new multiplexes and drive-ins around Michigan. Some of the \"original\" multiplex theaters are still in operation today. Many have since been expanded, and all have undergone technological renovations (such as the addition of digital sound, digital projection, and recliner seating).\n\nBob Goodrich eventually began building his business outside Michigan, establishing theaters in nearby states. Over the last decade, the chain has focused on renovating older theaters with modern amenities, as well as continuing to build and plan brand new multiplexes beyond the Midwest.\n\nGQT theaters are primarily located in small towns and mid-sized cities. All locations are multiplex theaters, ranging from 4-to-16 screens and offering multiple formats and experiences across the board.\n\nThe standard GQT location features classic designs of the late 1990s, largely due to acquiring locally owned theaters from private exhibitors. However, Portage 16 IMAX (Portage, IN), Hamilton 16, Quality 10 GDX (Saginaw, MI), and Riverview 14 break with this tradition by incorporating vibrant colors with a modern design. This current style of design is being implemented in theaters currently being developed, as well as in theaters being renovated throughout the movie exhibition chain.\n\nAn increasing variety of food options are being sold at GQT concession stands, offering more concessions over traditional movie theater snacks. Typical concession items include popcorn, soda, candy, nachos, pretzels, hot dogs, and slushies. As of late, the larger multiplexes have begun offering personal pan pizzas, chicken fingers, and mozzarella sticks.\n\nIn addition, lobby renovations at Hamilton 16 and Kendall 11 GDX (Oswego, IL) have led to the creation of Screen Taps. Screen taps is a belly-up bar or bar behind a concession stand giving adult moviegoers aged 21 or over an alternative to the traditional beverages offered at the theater concession stand. Offering select local and regional craft beers on draft, plus a variety of domestic bottle choices. In addition, Screen Taps has a house red or white wine. Select locations also serve margaritas and daiquiris. Screen Taps is available at Bay City 10 GDX (Bay City), Brownsburg 8 GDX (Brownsburg), Eastside 10 IMAX (Lafayette), Hamilton 16, Jackson 10 (Jackson), Kalamazoo 10 (Kalamazoo), Kendall 11, Krafft 8 (Port Huron), Portage 16, Quality 10 Saginaw, Riverview 14, and West Columbia 7 (Battle Creek).

In his only series as captain, he led India to its first win against Australia. According to \"Wisden Asia\", he was one of the first cricketers to have endorsed commercial brands.\n\nRamchand was born on 26 July 1927 in Karachi, British India (now in Pakistan) into a Sindhi family. He began his cricket career playing for Sind, and, after the Partition of India, settled in Bombay.\n\nRamchand made his first-class debut for Sind against Maharashtra in the 1945–46 Ranji Trophy. He represented Sind in two more first-class matches, before making the switch to Bombay at the 1948–49 Ranji Trophy. In the Ranji final that season, he scored a pair of fifties (55 not out and 80 not out), batting at number 10, as Bombay registered a win.\n\nRamchand was part of the Bombay team in five more Ranji wins, scoring a hundred in all five finals. He scored 149 in the 1951–52 final against Holkar, 106 in the 1959–60 final against Mysore, 118 in the 1960–61 final against Rajasthan, 100 in the 1961–62 final against Rajasthan, and 102 not out in the 1962–63 final against Rajasthan.\n\nRamchand was picked in the Indian squad for the England tour in 1952 with his selection being called a \"surprise\". He was dismissed for a pair of ducks in his debut Test at Headingley. He played all four Tests on the tour, and managed only 68 runs and 4 wickets in the series. His performance improved on the West Indies tour in 1952–53, when he was not only promoted up the order but also given the new ball. He made 249 runs at an average of 24.90 in the five-match series and took 8 wickets.\n\nWhen India toured Pakistan for five Tests in early 1955, Ramchand averaged 24.90 with the bat and took 10 wickets. His notable performances in the series included a knock of 53 in the second Test after India were reduced to 103 for 7, and career-best bowling figures of 6 for 49 in the fifth Test match at Karachi.\n\nRamchand scored his maiden Test hundred (unbeaten 106) against New Zealand at Calcutta in December 1955. His second Test hundred came at his home ground Brabourne Stadium against Australia in October 1956, when he made 109 against a bowling attack consisting of Ray Lindwall, Pat Crawford, Alan Davidson and Richie Benaud. His knock which included 19 fours was described as \"an innings of guts and gumption, studded with rasping square-cuts and full-blooded hooks.\"\n\nRamchand's next series came two years later when the West Indies toured India for three Tests. In an otherwise unsuccessful series, his unbeaten 67 in the first match ensured India held on for a draw.\n\nIn December 1959, Ramchand was named captain for the five-match series against Australia. Although his individual performance in the series was unimpressive with averages of 12.33 with the bat and 200 with the ball, Ramchand's captaincy was praised in the media as he led India to its first Test win against Australia, in the second match at Kanpur. India lost the series 1–2 amid expectations of a whitewash victory for the strong Australian team. Chandu Borde recollected that Ramchand captained the team \"brilliantly to victory\" and that he was \"always giving us the self-belief that we could beat them.\" This was also his last series for India.\n\nRamchand was an aggressive middle-order batsman who also often opened the bowling. \"Wisden Asia\", in its obituary, described him as \"a brilliant all-rounder: an explosive batsman, a very good opening bowler and a superb close catcher.\" Although strongly built, Ramchand was a medium-pace swing bowler and mainly relied on the inswinger. Cricket writer Sujit Mukherjee once said that Ramchand \"looked every inch a fast bowler until he actually bowled.\"\n\nAs a captain, Ramchand was remembered by his teammates as a leader who instilled self-belief in them and motivated them.\n\nRamchand worked as the manager of the Indian team at the 1975 Cricket World Cup. He worked 26 years for Air India, having served as station manager in Bangkok and Hong Kong. In 1995, he recovered after suffering a cardiac arrest.\n\nRamchand suffered three heart attacks in the two months preceding his death. He was admitted to the Hinduja Hospital in Mumbai on 1 September 2003, and, days before his death, asked the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for financial help for his treatment. The BCCI granted 2 lakh for the treatment, saying further financial assistance would be provided if required. On 5 September, it was reported that he had been discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU). His wife Leela Ramchand stated that \"he had to be shifted out of the ICU as we cannot afford it.\" He died on 8 September in the hospital due to \"heart complications\".\n\n"}

His autobiographical 1979 memoir, \"Pubertet\" (\"Puberty\"), won the Nordic Council's Literature Prize in 1979.\n\nLo-Johansson was born in Ösmo in a family of bound (unfree) agricultural labourers. He wrote over 50 proletarian novels and short-stories, all of which carried vivid portrayals of working-class people. He described the situation of the Swedish land-workers, \"statare\", in his novels, short stories and journalism, which encouraged the adoption of certain land reforms in Sweden. He also caused much controversy with his features on old-age pensioners, gypsies and other non-privileged people. He died, aged 89, in Stockholm.\n\nLo-Johansson first came to the literary fore in the mid-1930s with the publication of his short story collections. His stories were infused with realistic and detailed depictions of the plight of landless Swedish peasants, known as \"statare\". The first of his short stories collection to be published was \"Statarna I–II\" (1936–37; \"The Sharecroppers\"), followed by his \"Jordproletärerna\" (1941; \"Proletarians of the Earth\", a novel. Autobiographical to a large extent, these works were nevertheless more than one man's story. They were a potent attack on the prevalent social conditions, especially the inequality in Swedish society. Lo-Johansson's books combined political astuteness and literary craftsmanship to such a competent degree that they are regarded as the stimulant behind the labor movement that ultimately led to the abolition of indentured farm labor in 1945.\n\nLo-Johansson is best known for his vivid recollections of the life in Swedish trade-unionist and literary circles of the twenties, thirties and forties. He also continued throughout his long life to insist that literature should face the world from the under-dog's perspective.\n\nLo-Johansson's works are characterized by a vivid expression of individual human suffering. A great example of this motif is character of the farm servant's wife in \"Only A Mother\" (1939). He also explored the conflict between individualism and collectivism extensively in his autobiographical series of eight novels. He published the series in the 1950s with \"The Illiterate\" (1951). He published the last book in the series, \"The Proletarian Writer\" in 1960. In the 1970s he wrote numerous short stories dealing with the seven deadly sins. In the 1980s he wrote several memoirs.\n\nIvar Los park on Mariaberget, Stockholm is named after him. There is a 1991 bronze bust of Lo-Johansson by Nils Möllerberg in the park on Bastugatan.\n\nThe Ivar Lo Society preserves his apartment in Stockholm as a museum.\n\nThe Stockholm city library describes Lo-Johansson as \"one of our greatest proletarian writers\" and an \"innovator of Swedish realistic prose, engaged with social issues like care of the elderly and the question of tied labour.\"\n\n"}

It has a population of people.\n\nWith an area of , it is the second largest city in the province after Ormoc City. Formerly, Baybay was the biggest town in Leyte in terms of population and second in terms of land area, after Abuyog. The Baybay language, a Visayan language distinct from both Waray-Waray and Cebuano, is spoken in the City itself.\n\nBaybay houses a major port on the central west coast of Leyte, where ferries leave for and from Cebu and other islands. It has also the Baybay Public Terminal, serving routes from Tacloban, Ormoc, Maasin, Manila, Davao City, and other towns in Leyte, Southern Leyte, and Samar.\n\nGenerally an agricultural city, the common means of livelihood are farming and fishing. Some are engaged in hunting and in forestall activities. The most common crops grown are rice, corn, abaca, root crops, fruits, and vegetables. Various cottage industries can also be found in Baybay such as bamboo and rattan craft, ceramics, dress-making, fiber craft, food preservation, mat weaving, metal craft, and Philippine furniture manufacturing and other related activities.\n\nIt is the home of the Visayas State University, one of the leading schools in Southeast Asia on agricultural research, and was called as \"Resort University.\"\n\nBaybay is bounded by Camotes Sea to the west, Albuera to the north, Inopacan to the south, Burauen, La Paz and MacArthur to the northeast, Javier to the east, and Abuyog and Mahaplag to the southeast.\n\nThe climate is of Coronas Climate type IV, which is generally wet with no particularly discernible seasons. Its topography is generally mountainous in the eastern portion as it slopes down west towards the shore line. Generally an agricultural city, the common means of livelihood are farming and fishing. Some are engaged in hunting and in forestal activities. The most common crops grown are rice, corn, abaca, root crops, fruits, and vegetables. Various cottage industries can also be found in Baybay such as bamboo and rattan craft, ceramics, dress-making, fiber craft, food preservation, mat weaving, metal craft, furniture manufacture and other related activities.\n\nBaybay comprises 92 barangays, 23 of which are in the Poblacion, with one barangay jointly located. The remaining 68 are rural barangays.\n\nBaybay was believed to be the only settlement on the western coast of Leyte known to the first Spanish conquistadors that came with Magellan, as was Abuyog in the eastern part of the province, and Limasawa and Cabalian in the south. In 1620, the Jesuit fathers which belonged to the \"residencia\" of Carigara, the first and central station of the Society of Jesus in Leyte.\n\nBy superior approbation, Baybay was created a parish on September 8, 1835 with the invocation of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. However, the town was erected and independent parish on February 27, 1836.\nWhen the Augustinians took over the administration of the parish after the expulsion of the Jesuits, they opened the first school in Baybay. During their time, the first road leading to Palompon was constructed, thus bringing Baybay closer to her neighboring municipalities. The Augustinian fathers stayed in the town for 75 years - all of which they devoted to the upliftment of the natives in education and in their economic standing.\n\nThe first church of Baybay was built in Barrio Punta where it still stands today but is in need of repair. Punta is one of the seven original barrios of Baybay and was even believed to be the original site of Baybay itself, although there are others who say that it was actually in Kabkab, in the vicinity of Barrio Pangasugan.\n\nChinese invaders attempted to conquer the community, but the brave and staunch natives foiled several attempts. When the Spanish conquistadors spread themselves out to the provinces, an expeditionary force under Felipe Segundo, evidently looking for a bigger settlement, landed in a barrio north of the town which was and still is called Pangasugan. Landing near the river, he pointed to a spot and asked a native in Spanish for the name of the place. Unable to understand Spanish and thinking that Felipe Segundo wanted to ask about the river, he answered in Visayan, \" Ang suba nagbaybay sa Pangasugan.\" This is how Baybay got its name.\n\nBaybay also suffered from Moro raids. On October 22, 1605, one such raid occurred and the pirates, after leaving countless dead, carried off 60 men as captives. Again, on November 4, 1663, moors under the dreaded Corralat took their toll of human lives and captives after mercilessly slaughtering the handful of men who defended the town with the aid of the parish priest.\n\nBaybay suffered a great setback in 1866 when a great fire practically reduced the town to ashes leaving only the chapel of the Holy Cross in a miraculous manner.\n\nThe civil administration of the town during the Spanish era was placed in the hands of the gobernadorcillo, assisted by a teniente and the different jueces and cabezas. In 1892, in accordance with the provisions of the Mayura law, the head of the municipal government was given the designation of \"Capitan Municipal\" and his assistants in office were called \"teniente mayor indice\" and the \"teniente de policia.\" For the first time, a juez de paz was designated and a detachment of guardias civiles was placed in the town.\n\nThe construction of the church, which still stands today, was begun under the engineering administration of Mariano Vasnillio during the term of Fr. Vicente E. Coronado in 1852. The construction lagged for ten years after which the work was resumed under Maestro Proceso, who came from Manila for the purpose of finishing the work. The church was finally finished in 1870 after Capitan Mateo Espinoso, a sculptor and painter of renown, put on the finishing touches. The altar and the rails as they stand today are a credit to his genius.\n\nAs the Spanish residents moved away in the early months of 1898, the reins of local government passed completely into the hands of the Filipino officials. An election was held and Don Quirimon Alkuino was elected as the first Filipino presidente. However, after about four months, Gen. Vicente Lukban nullified the results of the election and ordered another one to be held, with the same results. Lukban ordered that the barrios of Baybay be named after the tenientes, thus Caridad was renamed \"Veloso,\" Plaridel became \"Alvarado,\" Bitanhuan was named \"Coronado.\" San Agustin \"Sabando,\" Punta \"Virgineza,\" Pomponan \"Montefolka,\" Gabas \"Bartolini\", etc.\n\nThroughout these years, Baybay developed into one of the biggest towns in Leyte.\n\nThe port of Baybay was closed in 1899 by the American coast guards. The price of commodities soared and products like copra and hemp accumulated in the docks. The order was lifted, but only after 14 ships, the greatest number to dock in port at one time, had stayed in port for days waiting for the order to leave.\n\nOn February 10, 1901, the first Americans arrived in Baybay on the ship \"Melliza\", their arrival caused great confusion and the people evacuated to the barrios. Only a few officials stayed in the town. The next day, soldiers scoured the countryside convincing the people to return to their homes.\n\nEven while the local government was under Don Quirimon Alkuino, he was under orders to follow Capt. Gilmore's (commander of the American attachment) advice. Eventually, this caused conflicts in the local government, and Filipinos took to the hills to join the fight against the Americans.\n\nThere were several attempts to attack the American garrison in the town, but practically all of them failed because the Americans had superior arms. Don Guilermo Alkuino and Don Magdaleno Fernandez led the first attack with more than 200 men. The American soldiers fought another in Barrio Pomponan that resulted in the death of 30 men and the destruction of the barrio.\n\nA group of Hilongosnons under the renowned Francisco Flordelis made an attempt in 1901 but they were driven off in a battle at Barrio Punta.\n\nFilipino nationalist made Baybay one of the areas where they made their last stand against the Americans. Later, the surrender ceremonies were held in the town, but only after numerous conferences between American officers and Filipino pacifists were held to effect the surrender of the resistance leaders. The surrender of Capt. Florentino Penaranda who was the last to give up the fight was a colorful one. All his men and officers, thousands of them, gathered at the banks of the Pagbanganan River. From there, they marched to the plaza in front of the municipal hall where the American officers were waiting. Before the Filipinos laid down their arms, Penaranda delivered a speech that even today is considered one of the most stirring addresses made in the province. To commemorate the event, a sumptuous banquet was held for the Americans and the Filipino nationalists. The following day, the Filipino soldiers trekked home in their uniforms to start another life of peace and work.\n\nA sect of the Protestant religion entered Baybay for the first time sometime in 1900. They established their own church in the poblacion. In 1902, the Philippine Independent Church established itself in the barrio of Caridad; shortly afterwards, the Seventh Day Adventists came in.\n\nAt the turn of the century, a provincial high school was founded in Baybay, one of the first high schools in Leyte. The government also established the Baybay National Agricultural School for young farmers of Visayas and Mindanao.\n\nThe Japanese forces came to Baybay in two waves in 1942. A puppet government was established shortly after their arrival wherein Paterno Tan Sr. was the mayor.\n\nIn 1944, American planes passed the town in bombing missions in Cebu. They bombed a ship at anchor in the port of Baybay and left it in flames. The Japanese Imperial Forces left the town on October 19, 1944.\n\nBaybay was used by liberation forces as a springboard for patrol units in the south and for forces that went north for the great battle of Ormoc, where a fierce battle was raging. The hospital was taken over by the provincial government and is still functioning today.\n\nThe people of Baybay, known as Baybayanons or Baybayanos (depending on the usage) which are Cebuano-speaking. Most of the people are Roman Catholic with almost 90% of the whole population.\n\nPeople of Baybay City are mostly Boholano-speaking and Cebuano-speaking Leyteños with some influences from the Waray-Waray language. Baybayanon is the language spoken by inhabitants of the original settlements of Baybay City before mass migration of Cebuanos and Boholanos into the area and widely recognized as predating the surrounding Cebuano communities. It is a more representative language reference name than the so-called \"Utodnon\" or \"Waya-Waya\" since it does not refer to a single barangay, but spoken in five barangays, namely Guadalupe (Utod), Gabas, Kilim, Patag and Pangasugan.\n\nIt is a living language given an ISO 639-3 language code bvy and has an approximate 10,000 speakers (2009 J. Lobel). It has been listed by Ethnologue as a dialect of Waray-Waray, however, it is distinct from Waray-Waray, and is not mutually intelligible with that language. Furthermore, Baybayanon speakers do not consider themselves or their language to be Waray-Waray. No published works have argued that Baybayanon is a dialect of Waray-Waray; in fact, published works (by Rufino, as well as Lobel's forthcoming dissertation) have specifically referred to this as a distinct or separate language. Other languages spoken by few in the city include English, which is used as a second languages, as well as Spanish and Chinese, mainly spoken by the remaining people of mestizo and Chinese descent.\n\nExecutive power is vested in the mayor. The \"Sangguniang Panlungsod\" or the city council has the legislative power to create city ordinances. It is a unicameral body composed of ten elected councilors and certain numbers of ex officio and sectoral representatives. It is presided by the vice mayor, the City Mayor and the elected city councilors are elected-at-large every three (3) years. Also, the city has also Regional Trial Court Branch 14 and Municipal Trial Court in Cities whose both located at the city proper in front of the Baybay Legislative Building and Convention Center.\n\nBaybay is a hub of business and industry for the western coast of Leyte, with a commercial service sector in the city that includes banks, virtual assistance centers, restaurants, cafes, night spots, sports centers, as well as retail and wholesale stores. The city's seaside promenade is the most visited, especially at night-time.\n\n\nThe Spaniards were only able to pick up the word “baybay” thus they named the place as such.\n\nBaybay City can be reached by different types of transportation:\n\n\nThere are two radio stations operating in Baybay: \"Groove FM\" (DYBK 92.5 FM), located at P&Q Subdivision, Barangay Cogon, Baybay City, Leyte, owned by the 5th Congressman District of Leyte, Jose Carlos Cari, and the \"Radyo Natin Baybay\" (DYSA 102.9 FM) located at Tres Martires Street, 6521 Baybay, Leyte, one of the radio stations owned by Radyo Natin Network.\n\nThe Pioneer Cable Vision Incorporated or (PCVI) provides 51 channels in total. It has expanded its services in the towns of Inopacan, Hilongos, Bato, and Matalom. Other subscribers prefer to use Cignal Digital TV, G Sat, and Sky Direct.\n\nThe City is home to various colleges and universities in the country.\n\n\n\n\nThere are 71 elementary schools in the city, 3 are located in the poblacion and 68 in rural areas.\n\nThere are several pre-elementary schools, i.e. kindergartens, as well as day care centers in various barangays.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe name \"Burauen\" evolved from the word “\"burabod\"” which means \"spring\". This is because Burauen is the fountainhead of several rivers: the big Daguitan and Marabong rivers, the Guinarona and Hibuga rivers that pass through several neighbouring towns, as well as several smaller ones. The legend behind the name speaks of a drought when several tributaries of these rivers dried up, forcing people to flock to a cluster of large springs in the town. The place was duly called “\"Buraburon\"” which according to Justice Norberto Lopez Romualdez Sr., is the “multiplicative construction of the word \"\"haru\"” (spring), which indicates “abundance”. Over the years, the name “\"Buraburon\"” (\"having many springs\") evolved into “\"Burawon\"” and finally into “\"Burawen\"”.\n\nIt is located in the central part of Leyte Island, bounded to the north by Dagami and Tabon-tabon, on the east by Julita, south by Lapaz and on the west by Albuera and Ormoc.\n\nBurauen is politically subdivided into 77 barangays.\n\nClandestine diggings conducted by antique hunters and verified by National Museum archaeologists yielded valuable artifacts consisting of chinaware and jars. Some of the discoveries were Stone Age artifacts and implements. These antiques and artifacts were found on the plateaus of both sides of the Kag-oloolo Brook of Barangay Patag and Villa Aurora, which were about 16 kilometers south-west of the poblacion of Burauen. Similar artifacts were found in Barangay Paghudlan which is 12 kilometers from the Kag-oloolo. Earlier diggings on the south-western portion of the \"poblacion\", and those in Barangays Tambuco and Armasen, revealed several precious antiques. With the extensive presence of these artifacts over the said areas, the past locations of prehistoric settlements in Burauen during are indicated.\n\nPrior to incorporation as a separate town, Burauen was part of Dagami. The town was a mission church established by the Jesuits, along with Pastrana which was also part of Dagami.\n\nIn the , the population of Burauen, Leyte, was people, with a density of .\n\nMajor economic activities of the people in this town include farming, trade/commerce and tourism. Palay, coconut and abacá fiber are among its major crops. With its existing wonders, Burauen recently on its way in developing its tourism industry. It is backed by good governance and improving quality of infrastructure development.\n\nBurauen is composed of vast wetland forest that houses thousands century old trees surrounding Mahagnao Volcano, Although the volcano has been inactive, it is classified as potentially active due to the active thermal features of the mountain. Also, there are two kinds of lakes. The one that on the southern foot of the volcano and the other one on the southeastern part. Hot springs, water fall and rivers are also the top destination famous on the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the fast development of tourism industry, locals are starting to contribute by joining local associations intended to took care of the natural park itself.

The mountain obstructs and contains the town in its present site - forbidding further growth but protecting the town from the strong typhoons that have battered neighboring towns.\n\nIn 1904, the town earned its independence from its mother municipality, Carigara. Apparently too young for such a difficult undertaking, Capoocan willingly returned to barrio status after a few years of determined but unsuccessful attempts at independence.\n\nOn January 1, 1928, when it finally gathered strength and gained experience, Capoocan was granted municipal status again. It was ranked as a fifth class municipality at first but later on ascended to fourth class category.\n\nIts first town executive was Brigido Merelos.

Hilongos is the center of government and ecclesiastical offices, shipping, rice production, trade, banking and finance, telecommunications, health facilities, education, sports and socio-cultural activities in this area.\n\nThe Port of Hilongos is one of the biggest and busiest in Region 8 (Eastern Visayas) and is well known for its good ferry and cargo services for Cebu City and vice versa. Due to its strategic location and proximity to the City of Cebu, Hilongos Port caters numerous day and night trips to and from Cebu City and is the primary choice for travelers in the area. Also, Hilongos is equipped with an airport, the Hilongos Airport in particular, which can be more helpful and useful if improved (travelers from the southern part of Leyte still needs to go to Tacloban or Cebu just to avail the services of commercial airlines). At present, Hilongos has two (2) public markets, the old one and the new one respectively. The Municipality of Hilongos is composed of fifty-one (51) barangays with vast coastal plains used mainly in the production of rice.\n\nHilongos shares its border with the Municipality of Hindang in the north, the Municipalities of Sogod (Southern Leyte) and Bontoc (Southern Leyte) in the east, the Municipality of Bato in the south and the Camotes Sea in the west.\n\nHilongos comprises 51 barangays:\n\nLore has it that in the 12th century, Amahawin, an Ilonggo from Iloilo, conquered neighboring barangays on Leyte’s western shore and extended his territory to the present limits of Inopacan, Hindang, Bato, and Matalom. He formed a settlement and named it Hilongos, because its inhabitants were Ilonggos.\n\nIn 1710, the Jesuits created a residence there. In 1737, according to , Hilongos was already a parish before this year. However, claims that Hilongos became a parish only in 1737. This date corresponded to the establishment of the town.\n\n1754 was the date of the oldest parish books (deaths) as of 1884.\n\nIn 1768, the Jesuits ceded Hilongos to the Augustinians. In 1774–79, the Augustinians established schools in Hilongos. In 1784, Palompon, a Hilongos visita, became an independent parish.\n\nIn 1862, Manicar led a revolt at Barrio Santa Margarita.\n\nIn 1873, Leovio Magia led a revolt. Unlike the towns of eastern Leyte, which were ceded to the Franciscans in 1843, the towns along Leyte’s western coast fell one by one under the seculars.\n\nIn December 28, 2016, two explosions rocked the small town during the town fiesta. The explosion occurred in Barangay Central Poblacion were a boxing match was being held.

The building of the church fabric itself is disputed. Did Celis-Díaz build it or did he merely repair an older structure left by the Jesuits? Oral lore claims that the church and the ruined convento behind it are from the Jesuits; but Repetti reports otherwise. Certainly, there must have been some permanent structures when Hilongos became a residence.\n\nIt is quite clear that the church complex underwent major renovations over the centuries. The original church, now incorporated as a transept, was a single-nave structure whose main door was also the gate to a bastioned fortification. Some bastions and walls of that fortification still remain. The main nave of the church is a modern construction, and the bell tower build by Fr. Celis-Diaz is an independent multi story structure, now plastered over with Portland cement.\n\nThe church interior is completely new in contrast to the convento which may have been completed in the 19th century. The convento guards many of the church’s antiques including silver vessels from the 18th century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nJaro is politically subdivided into 46 barangays.\n\nIn the early time of the Spanish regime, the section where the Jaro is situated today was a lush forest enjoying its primitive freedom undisturbed by human beings.\n\nIn those days, struggles between Christianity and Mohammedanism took place. Datu Buisan and Sirungan led one of the Moro expeditions. They came to the Visayas leading a fleet of colorful moro vintas razing Christian towns to the ground, killing the inhabitants and taking some as slaves. Christians had to unite against the invaders and this was how Jaro came into being. There were two Leytenos known far and wide for their skill with the native arms and bravery in wars. These two men were Bonsilao of Ormoc and Sinirungan of Dagami. These two men were so strong that the people concluded that they possessed supernatural powers. This belief was strengthened by the fact that they managed to drive the Moros away. Later, the two men decided to settle in a centrally located place where they could easily give aid to the beleaguered Christians especially the inhabitants of Balugu, Kalgara and the neighboring towns. An ideal place was finally found. This was atop a hill and this same hill is where the parochial church of Jaro is situated. As time went by, the place was consequently cleared and homes were built. Small crooked paths were widened and thus a town was born.\n\nThe legendary background of this municipality has been for the most part connected with the surging Cabayongan River, which crisscrosses the town. This river had served the inhabitants in many ways, becoming as it were the flesh and blood of the community. As historical data points out, the municipality of Jaro was once called “Salug,” a proximate location to the Cabayongan River. Its fertile soil and abundant fruit-bearing trees contributed immensely to its early growth and expansion. It became a “visita” because of the periodic baptismal visit regularly made by the priest coming from the town of Barugo. This “Visita” became the second name of the municipality of Jaro.\n\nIn later years, the village became the centrifuge of people coming from the outlying districts and regions due to a running well found at the foot of the hill where the present church now stands, the water of which was believed to be medicinal because of herbs whose roots were leading to the well. The old folks termed the mixture of the herbs from the hill as “Haro,” a medicinal potent drug supposed to cure all kinds of afflictions and diseases. People from near and far municipalities flocked to this place to be treated.\n\nThus, ultimately, the word “Haro” became a by-word among the people and later on used to denote the name of the place when it became a municipality in 1810. When the Spaniards came, “Haro” was transcribed as “Jaro”.\n\nNotre Dame of Jaro, a Catholic school run by the sisters of the Oblates of Notre Dame, is located in Jaro.\n\nIn the , the population of Jaro, Leyte, was people, with a density of .\n\nThere are a total of 42 Elementary Schools and 5 High Schools in Jaro, Leyte\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nA rural town approximately south of Tacloban City, Javiert is located between the boundaries of Baybay on the west side and MacArthur and Abuyog towns, along the Leyte Gulf. It has a very narrow coastlines and coastal plains facing the Pacific.\n\nJavier is subdivided politically into 28 barangays as per RA 3422 - An Act Creating the Municipality of Bugho as an independent municipality in the Province of Leyte, enacted on June 18, 1961.\n\nThe municipality of Javier, Leyte was formerly barrio Bugho of the municipality of Abuyog, Leyte. Bugho is a contraction of the dialect term \"Binogho\" (from local dialect root word \"buho\"), meaning a small clearing within a forest area. Settlers at about the turn of the century cultivated this small patch of land. Among the earliest known settlers was Macario Cultura, a native of Burauen, Leyte who is believed to have led his friends and relatives to farm the fertile soil of the area, then a virgin forest. Later, as the settlement grew, it became a sitio of barrio Pinocawan, and established barrio since the Spanish occupation.\n\nSometime in 1914, Daniel Falcon Javier of Consolacion, Sogod, Southern Leyte and a former teacher and principal of Cebu Normal School of Cebu City in the early 1900s came to explore the surrounding area of the new settlement. At that time he just came from Cabadbaran, Agusan del Norte where he started extensive farming activities since 1908 after his resignation as principal at the Cebu Normal School.\n\nA malaria plague in Cabadbaran, however, inflicted a heavy death toll among his people so that he had to explore other suitable areas until he came upon Bugho. Impressed by the fertility of the soil, he started staking out his claims in Bugho and moved out from Cabadbaran completely. Subsequently, Daniel married Dolores Mercado Veloso, also of Consolacion, Sogod, Southern Leyte, and settled in Bugho naming his settlement as Camalig. He initiated projects in the community where he was readily accepted as the teacher, Daniel Javier's concern was to educate the people. He opened a school in 1918 on land donated by Pedro Abordo with Leona Valles as the first teacher. Daniel Javier was a dedicated man without vices and he led the people in community activities to improve their working habits, eradicate superstition that hampered progress and introduced the use of vaccines and medicines. He also prevailed upon the people to accept the modern and progressive ways of agriculture.\n\nThe community rapidly progressed as people from Cebu particularly from Argao and Bohol came in droves at the invitation and assistance of Mr. D.F. Javier who helped them legally acquire land-holdings. The people from Argao led by Pedro Gacera of Barrio Talaytay of that town settled at the west side of what is now Barrio Binulho.\n\nA bigger school had to be built because of the size of the community and so Mano Daniel (as the people fondly called Daniel F. Javier) invited Mr. Waters, an American Superintendent to help them build one. Mr. Waters readily agreed and together with Evaresto Retucsan donated a new site for the school with the people contributing a counterpart of 1,000.00 Pesos with the release of 7,000.00 pesos from the government. The people through the \"Bayanihan\" system furnished most lumber requirements.\n\nCorn, abaca & coconut were the main products of the community. Mano Daniel introduced irrigation utilizing the abundant water resources. It became a progressive community and was the center of trade among the neighboring barrios. In the 1939's it was among the contenders for township with barrios Palale and MacArthur. Since Mano Daniel's leadership was recognized by the provincial and district politicians, he used this influence to bring community improvements.\n\nBugho was not only among the centers of resistance activities but also as evacuation centers during the Second World War. Food and other resources continued to be readily available and the local people supported the guerrilla movement. After the war, guerrilla remnants turned into organized banditry as Bugho still the center of these activities. However, the people continued to work in their farms and production was boosted with the evacuees helping them.\nCoconut, rice, abaca and ginger became the main products. Although organized banditry still existed and peace and order was not fully restored yet, the people were not deterred in their desire to become an independent municipality. During the mid-1950s, with the help of Attorney Higino A. Acala, Sr the \"Bugho for Municipal Movement\" was organized with Felomino Mercado, Pedro Gecera, Angel Caminong, Ambrocio Novio, Bernardino Tisado and Julia Brosas among its leaders. On December 18, 1959 at the initiative of Mayor Catalino Landia, the municipal council of Abuyog was convened to a session at Bugho endorsing by way of Resolution No. 7 to convert Bugho into an independent municipality of Abuyog to include the barrios of Caraya (Caraye), Ulhay, Tambis, Comatin, Caranhug, Talisayan and Manarug among many others.\n\nHouse Bill No. 2895 sponsored by Congressman Veloso of the 3rd District of Leyte and co-sponsored by Speaker Daniel Z. Romualdez of the 1st district passed through the Senate and became Republic Act 3422 creating the municipality of Bugho in June 1961. The first Municipal election was on November 12, 1963 and on January 3, 1964, the following officials were elected: Ambrocio Novio - Mayor, Felimon Tano - Vice Mayor, Vicente Rellin, Ruperto de Luna, Ruperto Villamor, Hidulfo Malasaga, Pastor Dingal, Eutiquiano Badique as councilors. It began its operations as a 7th class municipality.\nIn December 1965, the municipal Council unanimously approved a resolution to change the name of the municipality of Bugho to Javier, in honor of the late Daniel Falcon Javier, who died in Consolacion, Sogod in 1957.\n\nIn 1970, the seat of government was finally transferred to the present site on a building constructed through the efforts of Congressman Artemio Mate.\n\nIn 1972, the son of the late Daniel F. Javier, Domingo V. Javier, was elected Mayor. Within a few months after his assumption of office and before Martial Law, road networks were vastly improved.\n\nThirty eight years later, the decades-old political leadership of the Cua's was challenged when businessman Leonardo \"Sandy\" Javier, Jr. ran as Mayor in 2010. His desire to “give back” blessings has pushed him to serve his hometown, concentrating his efforts on converting the poor municipality into a model town that would be emulated not only in the region but in the whole country.

The film is about a fictional situation in which terrorist cells have made several attacks in New York City. The film stars Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Tony Shalhoub, and Bruce Willis.\n\nFBI Special Agent Anthony Hubbard (Denzel Washington) and his Lebanese American partner, Frank Haddad (Tony Shalhoub), intervene at the hijacking of a bus fully loaded with passengers, which contains an explosive device. The bomb turns out to be a paint bomb and the terrorists escape. The FBI receives demands to release Sheikh Ahmed (Ahmed Ben Larby) bin Talal, a radical Iraqi cleric who was suspected to have ordered the earlier bombing at the American embassy in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia who was captured and extracted while going to Lebanon by a group of American covert operators of Lebanese-American ancestry in the introductory scene of the film, who was then imprisoned in an undisclosed location after being extracted while the U.S. Government prepared to prosecute him for his role in the barracks bombing. Hubbard eventually comes into conflict with Central Intelligence Agency agent Elise Kraft (Annette Bening), as he takes a terrorist suspect into custody and arrests Kraft. Later, another terrorist threat is made and a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus is bombed. The feds captures a man named Samir Nazhde (Sami Bouajila), who admits to signing the visa application of one of the suicide bombers in the course of signing many applications for student visas in his job as a lecturer. However, Kraft insists that Samir is not a terrorist and that his continued freedom is vital to the investigation.\n\nThe terrorist incidents escalate, including the bombing of a bus and a crowded theater, a hostage-taking at an elementary school, and the destruction of One Federal Plaza, the location of the FBI's New York City field office, with over 600 casualties. In spite of objections, the President of the United States declares martial law and the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division, under the command of Major General William Devereaux (Bruce Willis), occupies and seals off Brooklyn in an effort to find the remaining terrorist cells. Subsequently, all young men of Arab descent, including Haddad's son Frank Jr., are rounded up and detained in Downing Stadium. Haddad resigns in outrage. New Yorkers stage violent demonstrations against the Army and the profiling of the Arabs; the Army fights to maintain control. There are reports of Army killings.\n\nHubbard and Kraft, now revealed to be an agent named Sharon Bridger, continue their investigation and capture a suspect, Tariq Husseini (Amro Salama). Devereaux's men torture and kill Husseini in the course of the interrogation. Afterward, Bridger tells Hubbard that Husseini revealed nothing of value because of the principle of compartmentalized information. Sickened, Bridger finally admits that she provided training and support to militants opposed to Saddam Hussein's regime, working with Samir to recruit and train the followers of the Sheikh. After the U.S. cut their funding and left them exposed, she took pity on the few of them who had not yet been slaughtered by Hussein's forces, and arranged for them to escape to the United States, ultimately leading to the present situation as they turn their bomb making and covert skills on the country that now holds their leader. Sharon and Hubbard compel Samir to arrange a meeting with the final terrorist cell. Hubbard also convinces Haddad to return to the FBI.\n\nA multi-ethnic peace march demonstrates against the occupation of Brooklyn. As the march is getting under way Hubbard and Haddad arrive at the meeting place, but Bridger and Samir have already left. Samir reveals to Bridger that he constitutes the final cell while in another sense he says, \"there will never be a last cell.\" He straps a bomb to his body which he intends to detonate among the marchers. Hubbard and Haddad arrive in time to prevent him leaving but Samir shoots Bridger in the abdomen as she struggles to stop him. Hubbard and Haddad kill Samir but despite their best efforts the pair can only watch as Bridger succumbs to her wound after managing to recite certain lines of the second half of the Lord's Prayer and concluding with \"Inshallah\" – the Arabic phrase \"God Willing\".\n\nHubbard, Haddad, and their team raid Devereaux's headquarters to make an arrest for the torture and murder of Husseini. Deveraux insists that under the War Powers Resolution the authority vested in himself by the President supersedes that of the court which issued the arrest warrant. Deveraux then commands his soldiers to aim their assault rifles at the agents, resulting in a Mexican standoff. Hubbard reminds Devereaux that the civil liberties and human rights which he took from Husseini are what all of his predecessors have fought and perished for. Devereaux finally submits and then gets arrested. Martial law ends and the detainees, including Haddad's son, are given their freedom.\n\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes awards the film a score of 44% based on 62 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B-\" on an A+ to F scale. \n\nRoger Ebert gave the film 2 stars out of four, writing that director Edward Zwick does a good job with crowd scenes, but criticizing it as clumsy.\n\nBruce Willis won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his performances in this film, \"Armageddon\", and \"Mercury Rising\".\n\nThe film grossed $40,981,289 in North America and $75,691,623 in other territories on a budget of $70 million.\n\nWhen the film opened, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee came out against the film. Its spokesman Hussein Ibish said \"\"The Siege\" is extremely offensive. It's beyond offensive. We're used to offensive, that's become a daily thing. This is actually dangerous.\" He thought it was \"Insidious and incendiary\" because it \"reinforces stereotypes that lead to hate crimes.\" Ibish acknowledged that Arab terrorists did, in fact, bomb the World Trade Center in 1993, but said that Arab and Islamic groups are upset by \"the very strong equation between Muslim religious practices and terrorism. ...[Thanks to this film] Every time someone goes through the Muslim ablution, the ritual washing of hands everybody does before they pray five times a day, that image is the announcement to the viewer of the presence of violence.\" Echoing such criticism, the Council on American–Islamic Relations protested the insinuation that \"Muslims have total disregard for human life.\" The groups were \"faxing and calling news organizations on a regular basis\" to voice their concerns.\n\nDirector Edward Zwick had met with Arab Americans, who suggested that the story be changed to mirror the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, when Arabs were immediately assumed responsible. This idea was rejected. Zwick noted that \"The Siege\"s villains also include members of the U.S. government, and dismissed the criticism, saying: \n\nIn a September 2007 interview, screenwriter Lawrence Wright attributed the film's failure at the box office to Muslim and Arab protests at theaters playing the film, but also claimed that it was the most rented movie in America after the September 11 attacks.\n\nScholar Alexandra Campbell quoted from former Guantanamo Bay detention camp captive Tarek Dergoul when she compared the fictional demonization and extrajudicial abuse of Muslims in the film and the abuse that Dergoul described in his first post-repatriation interview.\n\nOn July 12, 2006 the magazine \"Mother Jones\" provided excerpts from the transcripts of a selection of the Guantanamo detainees. Yunis Abdurrahman Shokuri was one of the detainees profiled. According to the article, his transcript contained the following comment:\n"}

He was the son of Albert Lindhagen and the brother of Anna Lindhagen and Arthur Lindhagen. He studied law in Uppsala. \n\nAs a lawyer, Lindhagen participated as adviser for the executives of the testament of Alfred Nobel. He was the secretary of the Nobel Committee in 1899. And at times he was suggested as a nominee to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, for his anti-militarism commitments. \n\nHe started his political career in the Liberal party, which in the time before democracy was considered a radical movement. He joined the Swedish Social Democratic Party in 1909, when he was already almost 50 years old. He soon joined the leftist opposition against the party leader Hjalmar Branting. The left-wing was headed by the young Communist Zeth Höglund, and in 1917 the group broke away from the mother party and formed the Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden (SSV).\n\nLindhagen fought for democracy, women's rights and better conditions for the working class and working farmers. He was also an advocate for better conditions for the indigenous Sami people in northern Scandinavia. \n\nCarl Lindhagen is known for his work for women's rights, and put forward a number of suggestions for the improvement of women's rights in the Swedish parliament, the most noted being that of women suffrage. In 1902, two motions regarding women suffrage reform were presented to the Swedish Parliament. One was from the Minister of Justice Hjalmar Hammarskjöld, who suggested that married men be given two votes, as they could be regarded to vote in place of their wives as well. The other motion was presented by Carl Lindhagen, who suggested women suffrage. The Hammarskjöld suggestion aroused anger among women's rights activists, who formed a support group for the Lindhagen motion. On 4 June 1902, National Association for Women's Suffrage (FKPR) was founded, which became the start point of the organized women suffrage movement in Sweden.\n\nAs the chief magistrate of Stockholm, Carl Lindhagen, together with Ture Nerman and Fredrik Ström, was part of a small delegation that greeted Lenin during his short visit in Stockholm in April 1917. The Swedish Communists took Lenin to the PUB department store where they bought him a brand new suit so he would look good and clean coming back home to revolutionary Petrograd. Carl Lindhagen originally supported Lenin and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, but he was also a pacifist and disagreed with some aspects of Communism. In 1921, he opposed the adoption of the Twenty-one Conditions of the ComIntern, and was thus expelled from SSV. He and fellow expellees formed a rump SSV. In 1923 he, along with the rest of his party, rejoined the Social Democratic Party.\n\nLindhagen was a longtime supporter of the international language Esperanto. From 1911, he addressed the Swedish parliament almost every year about the idea of an international language. In 1928 he clearly proposed Esperanto. As a result, in 1929, 1930 and 1931 the Swedish parliament voted a sum of 2900 kronas for instructional Esperanto courses. He also participated in presenting the Esperanto course of Andreo Cseh for Swedish parliamentarians.\n\nHe gave the opening speech during the 1927 World Congress of Esperanto in Danzig, and also spoke during an instructional session during the 1934 Congress.\n\nHe married the first time in 1883 and his wife died after long sickness in 1902. He remarried in 1904 and had two children with his new wife, Jenny Lindhagen.\n\n"}

Capitan Estefanio de Paz was the first teniente del barrio. Three leaders went to Manila to petition to the central government to raise La Paz to the status of a municipality. With the help of provincial leaders, La Paz was declared a fourth class town in 1918.\n\nOn July 14, 1942, the Japanese forces invaded La Paz. A company of soldiers occupied the town with their garrison at the central school building. Because guerrillas constantly harassed them, the troops stayed in La Paz for only three weeks. However, one month later, more troops came. They constructed strong trenches around the school site. The Japanese abolished existing political parties and formed the \"Kalibapi.\" They organized the local government and appointed a puppet mayor.\n\nThe Japanese tried to control the whole population of La Paz and organized the neighborhood associations in the poblacion as well as in the barrios. Schools were opened with emphasis on Nippongo, the Japanese language and the Asiatic ideologies.\n\nGuerrillas infiltrated the town to learn about the enemy strength that was considered important information for the coming liberation.

The natives answered \"Matahum\" or \"Matalom.\" This was the origin of the town's name.\n\nMatalom is politically subdivided into 30 barangays.\n\nBefore Ferdinand Magellan discovered the Philippines, a sea-faring people lived along the banks of the Matalom River and also on the islet of Canigao (formerly Comigao).\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the townspeople of Matalom constructed their own parish church, convent, school, and public buildings through their own efforts. These were all accomplished with the leadership of Spanish Friar Leonardo Celes Diaz and Capitan Calixto Pil believed to be the founder and first president of the town.\n\nLeadership in the town's administration may be divided into three regimes: Spanish, American and Postwar (Philippine Independence). The first president of Matalom during the Spanish regime was Capitan Calixto Pil. Succession to the chair of president was patterned after the original dynasty set up by the natives, by Pal and Pil families. Thus, after Kapitan \"Itong\" (Cpt. Calixto Pil) his son followed. Next in line was Kapitan \"Osting\" (Cpt. Agustin Pil) then Kapitan \"Kulas\" (Cpt. Nicolas Pal), then Kapitan \"Bentoy\" (Cpt.

The council members were then called, \"Guinhaupan,\" acknowledged leader in settlements, now \"barrios\" or \"sitios\".\n\nThe transition from the American regime to the time the Philippines obtained its independence saw Jeremias Pal re-elected alcalde in 1937 until the outbreak of World War II.

Victoriano Sela, a Franciscan Friar and the parish priest of Dulag at the time.\n\nOriginally the name was Mallorca, the name of the native town of Fr. Sela. The name presumably suggests the presence of palm trees in the locality, as the town of Mallorca in Spain was famous for its luxurious growth of palms. However, the natives found some difficulty in pronouncing the name. Whether the natural evolution and popular usage corrupted the name \"Mallorca\" into the present \"Mayorga,\" or whether the transformation was sanctioned by official decree motivated by phonetic convenience is not known. Nevertheless, the original \"Mallorca\" has evolved into its present name.\n\nMayorga is politically subdivided into 16 barangays.

A tradition and a rich heritage since the Spanish regime is a strong and lasting heritage to San Isidro Labrador sustained by the inhabitants tracing back from the original settlers up to the present. Since the Spanish conquest, the Meridanhons faithfully adopted the humble farmer, San Isidro Labrador, especially that agriculture is the dominant economy of the locality.\n\nThe town was formerly situated in a place now known as Betaug. It was then called ‘Siapun after a river near the settlement. The town used to be a barrio of Ormoc. In 1860, however, the barrio was organized as a town and was promulgated in 1867 by Domingo Fernandez, the District Governor of the Province of Leyte.

The dominant soil type (Faraon clay) is suited mainly for marginal upland crops, such as bananas, coconuts, and sweet potatoes. The destruction of the forest and critical watershed an area contribute to ongoing soil erosion and poses a major threat to the water supply of the town and its barangays.\n\nPalompon is politically subdivided into 50 barangays, \n10 of which are poblacion barangays with an area of approximately 1 square kilometer; the other forty 40 barangays are distributed along the coastline and in the interior rural and mountainous areas.\n\nAlong the strip of fertile coast, the community was founded circa 1620 and originally named Hinablayan. Fish, sea shells and other marine products abounded. People fished along the shore with arrows tied to vines. Its abundance attracted not only migrants but also Moro raiders from the south. Legend tells that local defenders used to hang the dead bodies of Moros on tree branches, so that the place come to be known as Hinablayan (from the word \"sablay\" which means \"to hang\").\n\nThe legend continues that when the Spaniards came they saw floating at the bay a cluster (\"pong pong\") of mangrove propagules locally known as \"\"Tungki\"\", they decided to change the name of Hinablayan to Paungpung, after the cluster of mangrove propagules to erase the bloody memory of the Moro raiders. Gradually the name evolved to Palompong, then to Palumpun, and its current spelling of Palompon sometime in 1700 or 1800. It is said that cluster later got stuck to the shoal until they grew up as trees, forming an islet which is Tabuk Island today.\n\nIn 1737, Jesuit missionaries arrived and built the first chapel which was later burned during a Moro raid. It was rebuilt and, as a refuge from attack, the chapel was enclosed with piled stones, with a \"cota\" along the frontage. When the people saw Moro vintas coming, the big church bell would ring the alarm and people rushed inside the church, fighting back with bows and arrows and spears.\n\nThe place assumed the role of \"cabeceria\" of all the municipalities in the north-western side of Leyte during the Spanish regime. At that time Palompon was under the parish of Hilongos. The parish priest visited the place occasionally for marriage, baptism and masses.\nThe Jesuits, later succeeded by the Augustinians, built the present church with 300 natives, who were forced labor without pay. If one or some of the laborers were unable to work, they were substituted by others just to maintain the quota every day for the next thirty years. The structure soon became a landmark of Palompon, reputed to be the oldest church in Leyte. On November 12, 1784, Palompon obtained its parochial independence from Hilongos.\n\nSometime in late 17th century, there was a nine-day battle between the Palomponganons and Moro raiders during which the residents rushed to the stone church (newly completed at that time) and took refuge for more than a week. The Moros suffered losses in that encounter and were defeated. A cannon in the town's plaza is a relic of that battle.\n\nOrmoc remained part of Palompon parish from 1784 until 1851, when finally it was declared as an independent parish.

Some 26% of the population resides in the poblacion barangays while the remaining 74% are found in rural areas. Palompon is densely populated, with 3.92 persons per hectare. This is much higher than the population density of Region VIII, which is 1.56 persons per hectare. However, population density is not evenly distributed among the barangays. The poblacion barangays are the most densely populated (Central – II is ranked first at 682 persons per hectare) while the hinterland barangays are the most sparsely-populated (Hinagbuan ranked last with 1.22 persons per hectare). Palompon had a literacy rate of 91.30% as per 1990 census. The municipality has as extensive educational system consisting of 45 elementary schools, 7 high schools and one state college (Palompon Institute of Technology), which is a well-known and respected institution in the province. The population growth rate has been relatively slow, averaging less than 1.4% annually during the period 1980-91, although this increased to 2.12% from 1991-95. The average percentage of deaths over births is 26.15 per 1,000, which is approximately one death rate and relatively slow increase in population, there appears to be a net out-migration of residents from Palompon. This is consistent with the overall trend of out-migration in Region VIII. One form of out-migration occurs when Palomponganons leave their hometown for Cebu, Manila or abroad where they can find well-paying jobs. The lack of well-paying job opportunities in Palompon encourage many skilled people (e.g. seamen, carpenters, contractors, etc.) to leave the town. The education programs offered by the PIT, which focus on marine transportation and engineering, are also in favor of this trend. A second (and more serious) form of out-migration occurs within Palompon itself where residents from the hinterland barangays migrate to the poblacion barangays. Many of these migrants join the rank of subsistence fisher folk while others become tricycle (or “trisikad”) drivers. The in-migration of these upland dwellers has given rise to slum communities, particularly in the poblacion barangays of Ipil—I, Ipil-II and Lili-on.\n\nThe crime rate in Palompon is very low compared to other towns in the Province and, so far, most are not considered serious. However, police officials expressed concerns that criminality may be on the rise because of the progress being experienced by the town, which is attracting an increasing number of in-migrants to Palompon. About 54% of the total population of Palompon belongs to the labor force, totaling 27,376 individuals. Of these, 13,963 are males (51%) while 13,413 are females (49%). Only about 1,390 workers (5% of total labor force) are employed in the so-called formal sector, which includes the schools, local government unit, national government agencies, the Pheschem Industrials Corporation (150 direct and 250 contractual) and the market vendors (120 with stalls). The remaining 95% of the labor force are employed in agriculture, fishing and the growing service sector within the poblacion of the town. Some 15,096 residents of Palompon (about 30% of total population) have been identified as living below the poverty line. The poverty line in Palompon has been set at a monthly income of ₱ 2,699.00 for a family with six members.\n\nCebuano (Kana dialect) is widely spoken in Palompon but you may hear a few who speak Waray-waray as there are students coming from different towns/cities from the eastern part of the region that are native Waray-waray speakers.\n\nIn general, the growth and development of agriculture and the rural sector in the province of Leyte and including Palompon, has been hampered by the following problems: 1) poor and inadequate infrastructure; 2) limited access to land, production inputs, credits and other resources among small agricultural producers; 3) inadequate post-harvest facilities; 4) inadequate government support; and 5) lack of irrigation facilities. Palompon has substantial food consumption requirements in cereals (rice and corn), meat, eggs, milk and products, fish, sugar, vegetables, root crops and others. Despite the LGU's plans to stimulate agricultural production to meet the above demand, Palompon must import many of the above commodities (mainly from Cebu) in near future. Palompon is mainly a coconut-producing area with 1,640 hectares devoted to coconut cultivation (30% of agricultural area). In contrast, rice is grown on only 794 hectares (394 Irrigated, 250 Rained and 150 Upland). The irrigated farms average about 3.5 metric tons (70 canvas) per hectare per crop while the rained lowland and upland areas produce 2.5 metric tons (50 canvas) and 1.25 metric tons 25 canvas), respectively per hectare per crop. Corn production (500 hectares) is low because farmers prefer to plant the traditional varieties that taste although these have lower yields. Farm sizes in the upland barangays tend to be small, ranging from one-fourth to two hectares. Farmers tilling these lands are considered as the poorest farmers who migrate to the poblacion barangays during the “slack period” from planting to harvesting in order to drive trisikads, hire themselves out as construction workers or go fishing. There is one potential for shifting agricultural production from the low to higher-value crops such as fruit trees and vegetables. To do this successfully, however, farm-to-market roads, irrigation and other physical infrastructure will be required. At present, only a few barangays have water from spring sources and communal irrigation systems; the rest rely only on the rain for water for their crops. The total area covered for distribution under the agrarian reform program is 2,784 hectares or about 50% of total agricultural lands. This covers 79% public land and 11% private land. Farm lot range from 0.2051 to 2.27 hectares. The major portion of Palompon farmlands are owned by small landowners 920 hectares or less) who reside in the Palompon farmlands are owned by small landowners are reportedly teachers who have invested their life savings are considered last priority for re-distribution under CARL and it is likely that many of these may eventually be exempted because of the current retention limits.\n\nThe fish sanctuary project of the LGU has contributed greatly to maintaining the level of fish supply in the area. Fisher-folk constitute a major segment of the population in the 18 barangays of Palompon that have access to the sea. According to DA data, some 26% of the population (1,230 out of 4,683 households) in these 18 barangays are fisher-folk. However, this estimate of fisher-folk population includes only those with bancas and do not include fisher-folk who rent boats or hire themselves out as laborers to fisher-folk-boat owners. Of these fisher-folk who own boats, 25% have motorized bancas while 75% rely on manual paddling. Because of their ability to venture out into the sea, fisher-folk with motorized bancas earn ten times as much as their colleagues with non-motorized bancas. Marketing of fish in Palompon is organized around middlemen (local name: “alpor’) who provide the fisher-folk with basic commodities and fishing supplies in exchange for the preferential right to buy their catch. The middlemen earns in two ways: 1) the basic commodities are priced at 10% higher than acquisition costs; and 2) the fish catch is priced lower by about 10–15% of the prevailing market price.\n\nWith the completion of ongoing port improvement and road construction efforts, Palompon will be in a strong position to enhance its role as the center of commerce and trade for the north-western towns of Isabel, Kananga, Matag-ob, Villaba, Tabango and San Isidro. Despite the absence of these improvements, the cargo handled at the Palompon port has already posted a significant rise from 27,891.043 metric tons in 1993 to 47,474.724 metric tons in 1995. At the same time, Palompon, already ranked second in 1991 passenger traffic among four ports which include Maasin, Ormoc and San Jose, Samar.\n\nThe existing market in the center of the poblacion, which is considered large for a town with the size of palompon, is testimony to the role of the municipality as a trading center for the north-western municipality of Leyte. A new and better planned public market may be required, however, once the port become fully operational. The existence of a large number of commercial establishments in Palompon including sari-sari stores, shipping companies, special services is further testimony to the role of the municipality as a center of commerce and trade. There are a number of flourishing labor-intensive industries within Palompon with the potential for expansion. Two of the more promising industries are 1) preparation of “boneless dried danggit” in the barangays Buenavista, Plaridel and Cantuhaon, 2) mat-weaving in barangays Plaridel, Cruz, Duljugan, Cantuhaon, Tinabilan,\nHimarco, Sabang and Lomonon\n\n\n\n\nThe original Palompon town has several historical sites and heritage to reckon with that can be equated with the interesting saga and unflinching struggle of the ancient Palomponganons in making a virtual place in the annals of the history and etched a proverbial deck in the sun. The bravery and undaunted valiant stanch against all odds of our forefathers to vanquish foreign invaders way back the \"Moro Marauders\" in the ancient times down to their collective participation to repeal the controversial atrocities of Spaniards, Americans, Japanese in the land had echoed to other municipalities in the Leyte Island. The historic places and sites of the ancient Palompon are still there for everyone to give a nostalgic focus. But due to the ramification of its former barangays to town-hood and even city-hood where geographical subdivisions followed and were made appurtenant, the present Palompon map has been trimmed down of some of its interesting locations that bespeak the rich and formidable historical accounts of the Palomponganons through the years. But in spite of the development process, still, Palompon is replete with historical sites and heritage that herald and relate to the present genre the town's glorious past. One of them is the Palompon Liberty Park (PLP). A full account on how this historical icon and location came to follow in the succeeding pages of this article. It was authored by a centenarian, Salud Esmero Reposar at 103 years old, who left the PLP legacy to us before she went home back to the Lord.\n\nPalomponganons are incontrovertibly religious people. This inheritance and burning passion for the religious life can be traced back in the olden times. The fact, that Palompon is one of the early few towns of ancient Leyte where the first mass of Christendom in the Philippines was held.\n\nThe townspeople are predominantly Roman Catholics. There are at present 14 religious sects shepherding their respective pious faithful in town. Thus, with the given number multifarious religious sites and various displays are expected and worth for everyone's valued time.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church of Palompon which was built for 44 years and thereafter was formally founded on November 12, 1784, is considered the oldest church in Leyte. Hence, a blown up feature on it is highlighted on the succeeding pages for everyone's information, guidance, and a boon to religious fervor.\n\nPalompon has 2 tertiary institutions:\n\n\nIt also has 12 secondary institutions:\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nSometimes referred to as the \"land of the fairies,\" Pastrana is an interior town of the province.\n\nGeographically, it is in the southwestern part of Leyte, and about from Tacloban City. Its rice fields and coconut plantations are the main assets of the place. The climate is cool and the soil fertile.\n\nThe water system at Tingib is designed to supply Tacloban and neighboring municipalities.\n\nPastrana is politically subdivided into 29 barangays.\n\nPrior to incorporation as a separate municipality, Pastrana was part of the municipality of Dagami. \n\nBefore the coming of the Spaniards, the settlement was called \"Pamagpagan\" because of the way the native inhabitants left their hair in disarray. In 1891, Captain Wenceslao Nielo, with the aid of a Spanish Franciscan friar by the name of Fr. Eusebio Ibanez, organized the settlement into a town and was transferred from Guinbaya-an to its present site. Father Ibanez blessed it with a holy mass. As a token of gratitude, the inhabitants called the town \"Pastrana\" in honor of Fr. Ibanez who was a native of Pastrana, Spain.\n\nShortly afterwards, parochial schools were established. At this time, the unit of local administration was the pueblo which embraced a number of barrios. The first gobernadorcillo was Captain Wenceslao Nielo. He was assisted in the administration of the pueblo by the \"Guinhaupan,\" a group of men equivalent to the present councilors, by the \"tenientes\" and by the \"Cabezas de barangay.\"\n\nWhen the Philippine revolution broke out in 1898, the people fled to the mountains and for a time, the local government then headed by Andres Villablanca, was temporarily suspended. It was at this moment in the history of the town that Jorge Capili, a guerrilla leader, burned the whole town. By the year 1901, Gregorio Marquez was appointed municipal president. The Americans who occupied the whole country, stationed a detachment at Dagami. They came once in a while to Pastrana to look after the affairs of the little town. In 1903, the town was reverted into a barrio of Dagami due to inadequate finances.\n\nPastrana for a time remained a barrio of Dagami. In 1912, Agaton Villablanca worked for the establishment of the barrio to a municipality so that its former status was finally regained. In gratitude, the people appointed Agaton Villablanca president. After five years when the first municipal election was held, Agaton Villablanca retained his leadership of the municipal government.\n\nWhen the Japanese occupied Pastrana in 1942, the people secretly fled to the mountains. The incumbent mayor also evacuated and his elder brother took his place. The Japanese did not stay long. The guerillas burned down the buildings and for some time there were no Japanese in the town. But in 1943, the Japanese returned, this time for long, for the soldiers constructed a garrison. The Japanese invaders ordered the civilians to live in the town proper. For two long years, the town residents suffered severely under the Japanese oppression.\n\nIn 1944 when the American liberation forces drove out the Japanese, Francisco Villablanca, who was the pre-war mayor, automatically resumed his position and under him, the town was restored to its former status as a peaceful community.\n\nAt present, Pastrana is fast progressing in the agricultural field because of the biggest gravity irrigation system in eastern Visayas, located at Barrio Tingib, lacing the whole municipality with irrigation canals. A direct road to Palo as well as feeder roads have been constructed. The Binaha-an Dam provides an ideal picnic site with the stately Amandawing mountain in the background.\n\nIn the , the population of Pastrana, Leyte, was people, with a density of .\n\n"}

The scope of the encounter in terms of warships, warplanes, and manpower involved is nothing short of astounding. The casualties borne by both warring parties are incomparable to other similar engagements, to say the least. It was, by all standards, a decisive victory for the American naval forces and could easily have turned the tide in favor of the Japanese Imperial Navy had the result been otherwise.\n\nThe battle was waged in an attempt by the Japanese to thwart General Douglas MacArthur's bold return via the Leyte Landings on October 20, 1944, the second biggest amphibious invasion in modern history after the Normandy Invasion less than five months earlier. The Japanese naval forces organized three attack forces with the American landing armada in the Leyte Gulf as target. The largest attack group, organized hastily by the Japanese, was the Central Force headed by Admiral Kurita. This powerful force encountered a token fleet of American escort ships in the Philippine Sea off the island of Samar. Despite overwhelming superiority, the Japanese Central Force surprisingly retreated through the San Bernardino Strait. Part of the remnants of the Central Force was pursued and destroyed by American warplanes.\n\nThere are six sunken Japanese warships in San Isidro Bay, northwest of Leyte Island. The warships were destroyed on or about the same period when the Battle for Leyte Gulf was waged.

The nature of a society's pantheon can be considered a reflection of that society:\n\nSome well-known historical polytheistic pantheons include the Sumerian gods and the Egyptian gods, and the classical-attested pantheon which includes the ancient Greek religion and Roman religion. Post-classical polytheistic religions include Norse Æsir and Vanir, the Yoruba Orisha, the Aztec gods, and many others. Today, most historical polytheistic religions are referred to as \"mythology\".\n\nScholars such as Jaan Puhvel, J. P. Mallory, and Douglas Q. Adams have reconstructed aspects of the ancient Proto-Indo-European religion, from which the religions of the various Indo-European peoples derive, and that this religion was an essentially naturalist numenistic religion. An example of a religious notion from this shared past is the concept of \"*dyēus\", which is attested in several distinct religious systems.\n\nIn many civilizations, pantheons tended to grow over time. Deities first worshipped as the patrons of cities or places came to be collected together as empires extended over larger territories. Conquests could lead to the subordination of the elder culture's pantheon to a newer one, as in the Greek Titanomachia, and possibly also the case of the Æsir and Vanir in the Norse mythos. Cultural exchange could lead to \"the same\" deity being renowned in two places under different names, as seen with the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans, and also to the cultural transmission of elements of an extraneous religion into a local cult, as with worship of the ancient Egyptian deity Osiris, which was later followed in ancient Greece. Max Weber's 1922 opus \"Economy and Society\" discusses tendency in the ancient Greek philosophers to interpret gods worshiped in the pantheons of other cultures as \"equivalent to and so identical with the deities of the moderately organized Greek pantheon\".\n\nIn other instances, however, national pantheons were consolidated or simplified into fewer gods, or into a single god with power over all of the areas originally assigned to a pantheon. For example, in the ancient Near East during the first millennium BCE, Syrian and Palestinian tribes worshiped much smaller pantheons than had been developed in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Weber also identified the link between a pantheon of gods and the development of monotheism, proposing that the domination of a pantheon by a particular god within that pantheon was a step towards followers of the pantheon seeing that god as \"an international or universal deity, a transnational god of the entire world\". The first known instance of a pantheon being consolidated into a single god, or discarded in favor of a single god, was with the development of the short-lived practice of Atenism in ancient Egypt, with that role being accorded to the sun god. A similar process is thought to have taken place with respect to the Israelite deity Yahweh, who, \"as a typical West Semitic deity... would have four or five compatriot gods in attendance as he became the national high god\".\n\nThe concept of a pantheon of gods has been widely imitated in Twentieth-century fantasy literature and role-playing games like \"Dungeons & Dragons\". These uses tend to borrow heavily from historical patterns. In these contexts, it is considered important for the writer to construct pantheon of gods that fits the genre, where the characteristics of the gods are in balance so that none of them is able to overwhelm the story, and so that the actions of the characters are not overwhelmed by the machinations of the gods.\n\nIn order to avoid the difficulty of giving an exhaustive list of deities when devoting a temple or sacred building, a structure explicitly dedicated to \"all deities\" also came to be referred to as a \"Pantheon\". The best known of such structures is the Pantheon of Rome, first built between the years 27 BCE and 14 CE. The building standing today was constructed on the same site around 126 CE. It was dedicated to \"all gods\" as a gesture embracing the religious syncretism in the increasingly multicultural Roman Empire, with subjects worshipping gods from many cultures and traditions. The building was later renovated for use as a Christian church in 609 under Pope Boniface IV.\n\nSince the 16th century, \"pantheon\" has also been used in a secular sense to refer to the set of a society's exalted persons—initially including heroic figures, and later extending to celebrities, generally. This practice is hinted at in previous references; for example, Jove of the proto-Indo-European pantheon (whose other linguistic forms are \"deus\" and \"divus\") meant 'god, rich man'. Lord Byron drew this connection after viewing the busts of famous historical figures in the Roman Pantheon, writing in \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage\" of how he wished to be at the center of an English Pantheon, and thereby associated with divinity. The Pantheon \"thus imbues the modern with the aura of the divine\", and \"models the interplay of ancient and modern forms of fame\". This trend continued into modern times, with the word \"pantheon\" 'of or for the gods' being reflected in the journalistic meme that refers to financial titans as \"Masters of the Universe\". For example: Francis Ford Coppola has been described as a member of \"that revered pantheon of independent movie directors, which broke the standard Hollywood studio mould as the 1960s expired\".\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nSanta Fe is politically subdivided into 20 barangays.\n\nAbout thirty years ago, Santa Fe was just one of the biggest barrios of Palo, Leyte. In 1948, Juan R. Perez, a native of this barrio, was a private secretary. Inspired and prompted by Melquiades Almen, Julian Dagami, Jose Catada, Antonio Evalo, Eulogio Navarra and Maximo Postreto, all civic leaders and with the consent of Mayor Generoso Alvarado of Palo, House Bill No. 1918 was drafted and sponsored on May 6, 1948 on the floor of the House of Representatives by Congressman Perez, creating Santa Fe a town. At first there was strong opposition from the residents of Palo as Santa Fe and other affected barrios were the main source of income for the town but the oppositionist were silenced by the budding leaders of Santa Fe. The bill was finally approved by the lower house and the Senate under the leadership of Senator Jose Avelino. However, politics intervened. While the bill was waiting for the signature of President Elpidio Quirino, there was a split of the party in power.\n\nAlthough President Quirino was the logical candidate for election, many leaders believed that Senate President Jose Avelino was the apparent successor to the presidency. Don Pio Pedrosa, then Secretary of Finance in the Cabinet of President Quirino was commissioned to sound out the political sentiments of the people of Santa Fe in that presidential election. His objective in visiting Santa Fe was to unite the leaders there so that it would be easy for him to secure approval of the bill pending the signature of President Quirino converting Santa Fe into a town. Those supporting the administration met Sec. Pedrosa in the old Martinez residence. Atty. Carlos Martinez was the leader of this group. Those supporting Senate President Jose Avelino, under the leadership of the private secretary of Congressman Juan Perez met Sec. Pedrosa in the public victory in the entire country. The bill creating Santa Fe into a town was vetoed. However, the yearnings, dreams and aspirations of this ambitious barrio was not to be denied for long. Smarting from the bitter lesson of disunity, fresh efforts were exerted to renew the campaign with more enthusiasm to convince the powers that Santa Fe should be made a free and independent town from Palo, in the name of progress. At this point, the warring political factions of the town were strongly united and determined to overcome all obstacles along the way. Under the guidance of Santa Ana, the patroness of this barrio, Don Pio Pedrosa forgave those who did not follow him in that presidential election. Upon his strong recommendation, President Quirino, by Executive Order No. 277 dated October 10, 1949, created Santa Fe, together with Tunga and Julita as new towns of Leyte.\n\nSanta Fe was then born as a free and independent town by presidential fiat and notably legislative action. On the eve of its traditional town fiesta, the residents under the leadership of Mayor Iluminado Martinez, one of the first councilors of Santa Fe in 1949 and dynamic parish priest Rev. Father Antonio Adre, in grateful remembrance and recognition, saluted the efforts of those who led in making Santa Fe a town out of several barrios of Palo. Its fertile fields and valleys abound with corn, camote and other root crops, while its rivers Kasili-on and Maslog are rich with fish, adequate in quantity to give food and sustenance to its ever-increasing population. The BANCOM projects in its northern periphery promises to be the rice granary of the town. Today there are 15 barangays in Santa Fe with an area of 5,567 hectares irrigated and planted with rice.\n\nIn the , the population of Santa Fe, Leyte, was people, with a density of .\n\nThere are a total of 17 elementary schools and 2 high schools in Santa Fe Leyte \n\n\n"}

Students can use the computers for 10 hours monthly, free of charge.\n\nTabango was a barrio of San Isidro, Leyte. Its early settlers came from the islands of Cebu and Bohol and from the towns of Villaba and Palompon. Later as the transportation improved same personage from the eastern side of Leyte Province found fortune in the place. These people were responsible in molding its culture.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Barrio of Tabango was made as the seat of the Civil Government of the Municipality of San Isidro, Leyte, the civil authorities returned the seat of the Local Government to the Poblacion of San Isidro, Leyte\n\nIn 1948, prominent residents of Tabango, took the opportunity offered by the late Jose L. Alvarez to work out in Manila thru Senate President Mariano Jesus Cuenco, the establishment of a new political unit. Documentation were initiated with the assistance of the Late Rosendo Homerez of Tacloban City, whose wife was native of Tugas, now a barangay of Tabango. Eventually, Executive Order No. 284 was signed by His Excellency President Elpidio Quirino on October 15, 1949 creating the Municipality of Tabango, Leyte. The first set of officials were appointed and sworn to office on January 16, 1950, to wit: Francisco Pastor (Municipal Mayor); Felomino Ocubillo (Municipal Vice Mayor); Adolfo Alvarez, Honofre Damayo, Potenciano Pijo, Mauricio Sevilles, Mateo Pastor (Councilmen).\n\nThe doctrine in the case of Pelaez vs. the Auditor General, G.R. No. L-23825 promulgated on December 24, 1965, placed the Municipality of Tabango in a great dilemma. It was in this case that the Supreme Court ruled and declared certain orders creating municipalities unconstitutional on the ground that the creation of municipalities is an exercise of the legislative power. On this premise, creation and exercise of the Municipality of Tabango, Leyte was illegal. However, the cloud that darkened the juridical personality of Tabango as a municipal corporation disappeared with the introduction of House Bill No. 2042 during the seventh congress by the Congressman Marcelino R. Veloso, Representative of the 3rd District of Leyte. The bill proposed to create the municipalities of Almeria, Cabucgayan, Tabango and Culaba, with retroactive effect in order to validate the existence of the aforementioned municipal corporations. The bill was finally approved into law on June 17, 1972 as Republic Act 6488 retroactive on October 15, 1949.\n\nTabango was originally a barrio named Tandaya. Most of its inhabitants lived near the seashore. One day, a man living in the barrio went to catch some crabs as swamps surrounded the place and crabs were abundant. Although he was an expert in catching crabs, he was accidentally bitten by a big one. A Spanish soldier happened to be near the place where the man was, so he came near and asked for the name of the place. The man bitten by the crab looked up and saw the soldier. Feeling the pain caused by the biting of the crab, he cried, “ Tabang mo,” which means help me. The soldier, thinking it was the name of then place, said, “ Ah, Tabango. “ The soldier repeated the word Tabango to his superiors and from that time on, the settlement was called Tabango.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nTanauan is one of the oldest towns in Leyte dating back to the year 1710. It comprises 54 barangays. The town has been baptized the title of “Cradle of the Intellectuals” or \"Bungto Han Kamag-araman\" since the Spanish colonial period. Tanauan is approximately 18 kilometers south of Tacloban City which is the Capital of the Eastern Visayas Region. It is bounded on the north by the Municipality of Palo, on the south by the Municipality of Tolosa, on the west by the Municipalities of Dagami and Tabon-Tabon, and on the east by San Pedro Bay. The town was heavily damaged by Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in November 2013.\n\nTanauan is politically subdivided into 54 barangays.\n\nThe town got its name from a towering Molave tree which served as a look-out tower. \"“Tan-awan” \"or \"\"Taran-awan\"\" means to look-out in the \"Waray-Waray \" language. A person who serves as a look-out would watch for the feared Moro Pirates who would every now and then plunder and loot the settlements along the coast.\n\nThe first known settlers of Tanauan were the family of Calanao with his wife and daughter. In 1661, Juanillo Siengco's family joined the Calanao family in the settlement along the bank of Bukid River at the foot of Adil Hill. By the time their settlements were more developed, the plundering of the Moros along the coast became intensified, and for their refuge, they built a stone-walled enclosure called\" \"cuta” \"in the area of Buaya. In the course of time, Juanillo's son Josef, married Calanao's daughter, Sangod, and from the families of Juanillo Siengco and Calanao a tribe was formed which gave Tanauan its first tribal leaders.\n\nIn 1710, the first town officials were appointed by the Spanish authorities during the Spanish reign in the Philippines. From 1710 up to the end of the Spanish Colonial period in 1900 and the start of American occupation, 47 persons became chief executives of the municipality.\n\nTolosa, an adjacent town to the south of Tanauan, was once part of the municipality. Through the efforts of certain Magdalino Vivero and Domingo Camacho, they petitioned the Spanish government to grant Tolosa autonomy from the municipality. The petition was granted in 1852.\n\nDuring the American Regime from 1901–1943, another set of municipal executives followed. When World War II broke out, Pedro A. Villegas was the incumbent Mayor.\n\nWhen the Japanese occupied the town, the incumbent Mayor Pedro Villegas and his secretary Janario Perez refused to serve the Japanese authorities. Thus, Rufo Cobacha was appointed Mayor by the Japanese and followed by Pedro Bulik who was eventually killed by the local guerillas.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, the town was burned by the guerillas in 1943. This unfortunate event destroyed the Municipal Building, including its records, and a lot of the big ancestral houses of Spanish Architecture along Calle Real. When the US Allied Forces stormed the town during the liberation of Leyte, it resulted in further destruction of the Municipal Hall \"( Lian Chong Building)\" and the few remaining houses along Calle Real. However, few lives were lost during the assault as the town's people were warned beforehand and took refuge at the fortified Parish Church. Eugenio Avila, Sr. was the incumbent mayor when the Filipino and American Liberation Forces occupied the town. The US Sixth Army initially established its headquarters in Tanauan before the construction of the Airfield began in November 1944.\n\nThe X and XXIV Corps from the United States Sixth Army took part in the liberation of Tanauan from the Japanese Occupation Forces immediately after the US and Allied Forces landed at Leyte Beach on October 1944. Shortly thereafter, the United States Sixth Army, under the command of Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, established its headquarters in Tanauan. On November 15, 1944, a meeting was held at the site of the Sixth Army headquarters by the commanders and staff members of the major units who participated in the Luzon Campaign.\n\nWhile the US and Allied Forces were able to capture the Tacloban airstrip, the work to further develop it for US warplanes had been handicapped due to the heavy concentration of troops, supplies, and equipment in the area during the early stages of the operation. It was further hampered by insufficient supply of corals for surfacing the runway. Works were also simultaneously being done on the other two airstrips of Buri and San Pablo in the vicinity of Burauen, but it was halted in the latter part of November 1944. A considerable amount of time and effort have been expended in futile attempts to make these airfields usable. The inability of the Sixth Army to meet its construction dates on the airstrips prevented the US forces from stopping the flow of Japanese reinforcements and made it impossible for the Allied Forces to give sufficient land-based air support to the ground troops.\n\nIn a desperate move to have an operational airfield, Lieutenant General Walter Krueger received permission from General Douglas MacArthur to construct an airfield in Tanauan. On November 28, 1944 the headquarters of the US Sixth Army was moved to Tolosa to start the construction of the airfield. The airfield site covers an area bounded on the north, south and west by Embarcadero River, and on the east by San Pedro Bay. The site was favorably chosen due to its generally flat terrain, good sandy surface, and satisfactory drainage - which proved to be an excellent location for an airfield. On December 1944, the field became operational. By December 25, 1944 there have been completed one runway with mat surfacing, one overrun, 90,000 square feet of warm-up area, 120,000 square feet of alert apron, one parallel taxiway, and 26 large dispersal areas. The control tower was code named “Velvet Tower.”\n\nAll Marine Aircraft Group 12 \"(MAG-12)\" planes in Leyte, which played an important air support role for the Sixth Army, moved from Tacloban Airfield to Tanauan Airfield on December 1944. The airfield was used by the following units:\n\nThe airfield was abandoned following the withdrawal of the Allied Forces after the war and was later on referred to as \"landing\" by the locals. Today, a small remnant of this airfield can still be found in the area called \"Pawa\" located in Barangay Santo Niño. Most of the remaining areas are now occupied by large business establishments such as the Pepsi Cola Tanauan Plant and New Leyte Edible Oil Manufacturing Corporation. The Tanauan Public Market, various commercial buildings and residential neighborhoods can also be found in the area. The airfield covers the area of what is now known as Barangay San Roque and Barangay Santo Niño. Maharlika Highway\" (formerly known as Highway 1),\" which connects Eastern Visayas Region with Luzon to the north and Mindanao to the south, traverses through the former airfield site.\n\nDuring the Liberation, Benito Saavedra was appointed Mayor by the newly restored Philippine government, then succeeded by the following in the order of incumbencies:\nAfter the Liberation period, Dionisio Boco became the first Mayor, then succeeded again by Pelagio O. Tecson, Sr. In 1950, Barrio Haclagan, the site of the former US Airfield site, was renamed Santo Niño.\n\nPelagio Tecson, Sr. was the Mayor during the Martial Law Period \"(Martial Law in the Philippines and the so called “New Society”)\" up to February 25, 1986 EDSA Revolution when Felix Cortez was appointed OIC Mayor by the new government. The local elections held on February 1, 1988 resulted in the election of Charles R. Avila. It was during his tenure that he was appointed as Administrator of the Philippine Coconut Authority in January 1991, and Vice Mayor Rodolfo Cinco succeeded him as Mayor.\n\nIn the May 1992 synchronized elections for national and local officials, Atty. Roque Tiu won over five candidates for the mayoralty position. Tiu was the Chief Executive of the town until his second term ended in 1998. Mark Gimenez was elected Mayor from 1998 to 2001. During the 2001 elections, Atty. Roque Tiu ran again and won over Mark Gimenez. Roque Tiu became the mayor for three consecutive terms from 2001 to 2010. After Tiu completed his term, his vice mayor Agapito Pagayanan Jr. run for the mayoralty position during the 2010 national elections and got elected. He served from 2010 to 2013. During the 2013 mid-term elections, Pelagio Tecson, Jr. won over the incumbent mayor with just a small margin of votes.\n\nIn the , the population of Tanauan, Leyte, was people, with a density of .\n\n\"Waray-Waray\" is the mother tongue spoken by the people of Tanauan. It is the lingua franca or common language of the Eastern Visayas region. It is used when people from other parts of Leyte who are primarily Cebuano-speaking comes to the town. However, Filipino (\"Tagalog\") is the language that is widely understood and spoken by the locals when talking to other people coming from Manila and other far provinces and non-\"Waray\" speaking Filipinos just like in other places across the country as Filipino is the national language of the Philippines. English remains the official language used by the local government and schools in its official correspondence and documents. Waray-Waray is used as a medium of instruction in schools in the municipality from Kinder to Grade 3. Filipino and English languages are officially taught in schools as part of the primary and secondary education curriculum requirement.\n\nTanauan has a 100% Christian population. Almost 96-97% of the municipality's population are Roman Catholic Christians. Every barangay (village) has its own Roman Catholic chapel aside from the parish church in the town proper (\"población\"or \"sawang\"). There are also adherents of other Christian denominations and sects like the Iglesia ni Cristo, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons), Adventists (Sabadistas), Evangelicals (\"Born-again\" Christians), Jehovah's Witnesses (Mga Saksi ni Jehova) and other groups that maintain their houses of worship The municipality's patron saint is the Our Lady of the Assumption (Nuestra Señora de Asuncion). The town celebrates its fiesta annually on August 15.\n\nIn 2005, the municipality registered a total income of PhP 47.6 million and went up to PhP 56.4 million in 2007, representing an average annual increase of over 9%, mostly coming from considerable increases in local taxes, permits & licenses and the Internal Revenue Allotment. The outstanding economic performance was attributed largely to the reforms and initiatives that were introduced by Mayor Roque Tiu, which streamlined the processes of getting business and license permits.\n\nAs a result of these reforms, the Municipality of Tanauan earned the Award of \"2006 Most Business-Friendly Municipality in the Country\" during the Closing Rites of the 32nd Philippine Business Conference held at the Manila Hotel on October 20, 2006. then President Gloria Arroyo handed over the Award to Mayor Roque Tiu and his wife PIA-8 Director Olive Tiu. Prior to winning this Award, the Municipality of Tanauan was adjudged as the Most Business-Friendly Municipality in the Visayas Area.\n\nThe businesses and industries that support the local economy are from agriculture, livestock, fishing, forestry & mining, trade and industry, and tourism.\n\nThe major investors in the Municipality of Tanauan are the following:\n\nTanauan is known for various locally made crafts which include bamboo craft, mat-weaving, bolos, brooms, hats, bricks, pottery, nipa shingles, and virgin coconut oil - most of which are made of local and indigenous materials. These trades have been the source of local pride, like the talented bricks and pottery makers of Barangay Canramos. Tanauan is also one of the best source of clays in the Region. These trades are mainly promoted by the Federation of Tanauan Women's Club with the support of the local government of Tanauan.\n\nTanauan still lacks an efficient infrastructure for its storm drainage system. Although storm drainage projects were constructed in the past, it was poorly planned and maintained that resulted in a failure to prevent occasional flooding in various places within the town proper due to sedimentation and clogging of existing drainage canals.\n\nThe construction of the birthing facility of Tanauan in 2009 was made possible thru the efforts of Mayor Roque Tiu and the assistance of the Japanese Government. The project was funded through the Embassy of Japan's Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Projects (GGP) with a grant of US$62,135 (approximately 3 million pesos). The facility was turned over to the local government of Tanauan on April 27, 2010. The Embassy of Japan's Minister for Economic Affairs Tomochika Uyama was present during the ceremony. The facility became operational since May 2010, and provides appropriate and accessible medical services for pregnant women in Tanauan.\n\nThe following are the telephone, mobile phone, and electric companies serving the area of Tanauan.\n\nTelephone companies:\n\nMobile phone service providers:\n\nElectric companies:\n\nWater supply:\n\nTanauan currently has one large municipal plaza which is located right at the heart of the town across the back of the old municipal hall. It has a mini-amphitheater and a large outdoor grounds which is often used as a venue for large open air activities such as the annual Pasaka Festival Competition and other various outdoor gatherings of the town, It also has two outdoor basketball court and one outdoor tennis courts. Surrounding the plaza are various centuries-old acacia trees that is one of the well-preserved in the Region.\n\nTanauan is accessible mainly by land using Public Utility Jeepney as the primary means of public transportation. Taxis are also available from Tacloban City and the Regional Airport but generally costs higher compared to the much cheaper Jeepneys. On the other hand, pedicabs and motor cabs are available when travelling within the local vicinity of Tanauan.\n\n\n\nMost locals take off their slippers, shoes, or flip flops before entering a house. During weddings, it is customary for the bride and groom to do the traditional folk dance called \"Kuracha\" and members of the families and guests alike are encouraged to pin money on their attire as a symbol of good luck and prosperity for the couple's future. Tanauananons also observe fiesta celebrations annually in different barangays to honor their respective local Catholic Saints. During the fiesta, it is a tradition to prepare food in every house and invite guests and visitors to share their meal as a sign of thanksgiving.\n\nThe Church is one of the six Architectural Heritage sites in Leyte. It was originally built by the Jesuit Missionaries in 1704 and was turned over to the Augustinians in the year 1768. Father Francisco de Paula Marquez spearheaded the repair and enlargement of the church from 1850 to 1860. He added a transept and constructed thick rock walls at the perimeter of the Church with towers on each four corners for defense against pirates. The Church survived a hurricane and storm surge of 1897. The Church takes pride of its Stations of the Cross made of Spanish terracotta originally made in Mexico. The rectory and pulpit were restored.\n\n\"Pasaka\" Festival started in 1991. The word \"\"pasaka\" \"means \"assumption\" which refers to the Virgin Mary as she was assumed into heaven. The festival, which runs from August 1 through 15, is seen as an opportunity to showcase the rich cultural heritage of Tanauan. It is a means of paying homage and thanksgiving to the town’s Patroness, Our Lady of the Assumption. It begins with a nightly cultural presentation being held from August 1 through 14 at the Tanauan Public Plaza, which showcases the best talents, culture, and tradition of the municipality participated in by various schools, the local government unit, and the non-government organizations of Tanauan. In the afternoon of August 14, the traditional Pasaka Festival Competition is held which features a colorful presentation of dance drama and street-dancing that depicts a community paying homage to the Blessed Virgin as she is assumed into heaven. The competition is grouped into three categories: the Senior Category participated in by high school students, the Junior Category composed of elementary pupils and the Merry Makers. The festival culminates on August 15, the Feast of the town’s Patroness, Our Lady of the Assumption, and a Holy Mass is celebrated at the Our Lady of the Assumption Parish Church. It is also observed as Tanauan Day which is a local holiday.\n\n\"Tinikling\" is the most popular and best known of Philippine dances and honored as the Philippine national dance. It is one of the oldest Philippine traditional dances and originated in Leyte Province. The people of Leyte describe the tikling bird as one of the most unique in its movements - walking around and between the tree branches and some grass stems. This bird was named \"tikling\" from which the Tinikling dance got its name. Because of the creativeness of the Leytenos, they imitate this bird by using bamboo poles.\n\nIn 2006, the attention of the then Mayor Roque Tiu was called regarding the 2005 Calendar of the Philippine National Oil Corporation entitled \"Sulyap\" (Glimpse) which highlighted the looking back into the home of Filipino culture and taking a glimpse into one’s roots in relation to moving forward in life. In the second page (March–April page), it featured the Tinikling with a brief description in Filipino: …\"”ang Tinikling ay nagmula sa Tanauan, Leyte. Isa ito sa mga pinaka-kilalang Pilipinong sayaw sa buong mundo. Ang pagkamalikhain ng mga taga Leyte ay nagbigay buhay sa simpleng galaw ng ibong tikling, kung saan nakuhaang pangalan ng sayaw. Sa Tinikling naipamalas ang likas na halina at pagiging masayahin na nabubukod-tangi sa mga Pilipino.”\" (Tinikling originated in Tanauan, Leyte. It is one of the best known Philippine dance. The creativity of the people of Leyte gave life to the simple movement of the tikling, birds from which the dance got its name, Tinikling. The dance mirrors the innate grace and joy of Filipinos). Since then, the municipal government of Tanauan requested historians and enthusiasts of culture and the arts to shed light on the issue so that the local government can initiate moves towards preserving the culture of the municipality, which has been baptized the title of “Cradle of Intellectuals” (\"Bungto Han Kamag-araman\" in Waray-Waray) ever since the Spanish Regime. Another version of the story has it that the Tinikling really originated in Tanauan, Leyte, particularly in Barangay Kiling. The name “Kiling” is also derived from the tikling bird. This version of the story has yet to be authenticated. Today, pinpointing the exact origin of this dance still remains a mystery.\n\nVicente I. De Veyra, a native of Leyte, collected folk songs such as \"Tinikling\" in his book \"Mga Ambahan\".\n\nTanauan is recognized as the “Skimboarding Capital of the Philippines\". It is told by tradition that skimboarding was first introduced in Tanauan in 2000, when an American national came to Tanauan to win the heart of a local lass. Since Tanauan is situated along the coast facing San Pedro Bay, the American national started making a skimboard which he eventually finished. However, he was not able to teach the local youths on how to use it since he already had to leave back to the States. He left the skimboard, and the local youths started to train themselves on how to use it. Thereafter, young people from Barangay San Roque and Barangay Santo Niño started making prototypes of the skimboard which were then sold to enthusiasts.\n\nIt has also been told, however, that the first skimboarder in the Philippines, Michael Miranda, together with his friend Kim Ian \"Dodot\" Montaño made the first locally-made skimboard, and with their enthusiasm for the sports introduced the skimboard and taught Tanauan locals how to ride it. The first skimboarding competition was organized by Darwin Maceda together with his friends Alexander Cumpio and Nerizza Reynera at Tanauan, Leyte's Bantay Dagat area on March 31, 2002. Since then, skimboarding started to spread to the nearby towns and later on throughout the country. Currently, national and international skimboarding competitions are held annually at the Bantay Dagat area in Tanauan.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is located south of Tacloban City.\n\nThe cities closest to Tolosa are Tacloban, Ormoc, Baybay, Borongan, Catbalogan, and Maasin. The nearest municipalities are Tanauan, Tabontabon, Dulag, Palo, Julita, and Dagami. Its distance from the national capital is 588.52 kilometers (365.69 miles).\n\nTolosa is politically subdivided into 15 barangays.\nAccording to popular beliefs, Tolosa derived its name from a legend about three chieftains (datus) who united their chiefdoms. According to the legend, the area that is now Tolosa was ruled by three great datus: the datu of fishing, the datu of harvest and the datu of hunting. Typical of chiefdoms in those times, the three datus regard each other with hostility. One time a great battle broke out among the three of them. Their people fought valiantly in defense of each datu. But the three datus were strong they could not defeat each other. Accidentally they were hit by their own swords and they died. Their blood spilt everywhere. Then came a great earthquake followed by a tsunami. When the floodwaters subsided, three promontories rose on three sides of the three datus' lands, as if acting as defensive walls of the contiguous land. Survivors of the great battle realized that the three hills were their great datus who were now united in protecting them from outside dangers. From three (tolo) they became one (usa).\n\nTolosa was once part of the nearby municipality of Tanauan. Magdaleno Vivero and Domingo Camacho petitioned the Spanish Government to grant Tolosa autonomy from Tanauan. The petition was approved in 1852, resulting in great jubilation among the new town's inhabitants. The town's residents, however, continued to call a nearby promontory Inapusong after the town's old name. Spanish officials named the town in honor of Tolosa, a town in the Basque Country, Spain. The town was formally founded in 1861 and became a parish on February 12, 1863. Its first parish priest was Padre Geronimo Asenjo, a Spaniard. The first Filipino priest of the parish was Father Quintin Bautista. In 1910, a plan to abolish the municipality worried its inhabitants. Owing to the efforts of Captain Daniel Romualdez, grandfather of the late Speaker Daniel Z. Romualdez, the plan to return Tolosa to the care of Tanauan was averted.\n\nDuring the liberation of the Philippines in 1944, Tolosa and its north eastern neighboring towns were spared from bombardment by the United States and Philippine Commonwealth forces when Eagle Scout Valeriano Abello of barangay San Roque, including two other identified scouts braved Japanese sniper fire and directed US and Filipino fire to the exact location of Japanese batteries along Leyte's north-eastern coast. Abello's act saved the lives of thousands of Leytenos and allowed the Filipino Soldiers and Allied Forces unhampered landing on the coast. This unhampered attack dealt the blow that broke the back of the Japanese resistance in Leyte, and ultimately The Philippines.\n\nA few days after the return of General Douglas MacArthur and the forces of liberation in Leyte, Tolosa became the base of the U.S Navy, as well as the 6th and 13th Air Force. It was in Tanghas, a barangay in Tolosa, where the famous American composer Irving Berlin first presented his renowned composition \"Heaven Watch The Philippines\" together with his Filipino audience including then President Sergio Osmeña and Carlos P. Romulo.\n\nAbout 4 decades ago, Tolosa suffered its worst environmental disaster. The sand in the beaches of Tolosa were black until the 1970s because of the abundance of the mineral called magnetite, a naturally magnetized iron, which was a prime raw material for high quality steel. INCO (Iron, Nickel & Copper Ore), a mining company based in nearby barangay Opong, stripped the town's beaches of vegetation to get the mineral, destroying much of the wide beaches and rendering the town's coastal defenses bare against the onslaught of tidal erosion.\n\nThen First Lady Imelda Marcos developed the area between the sea and Mt. Inapusong and built a large compound where she entertained Miss Universe candidates during the pageant held in Manila.\n\nIn the , the population of Tolosa, Leyte, was people, with a density of .\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is the smallest municipality in Leyte, both in population and area.\n\nThe municipality of Tunga existed as early as 1860 as a barrio of Barugo. At that time only about fifty families were residing there, most of them coming from the different towns of Barugo, Carigara and Jaro. There are different versions that have been told as to why the place was called Tunga. Due to their stronger credibility, only two of these legends have been selected as the possible ones. One states that according to our forefathers, before Tunga became a barrio, people from Ormoc, Carigara, Barugo, Jaro and Tacloban engaged in trade with each other and they had to stop by or pass this place. Some of them even made it their contact point for conducting their business. Through their exchange of ideas and conversations, they concluded that this place was halfway between Ormoc and Tacloban or Carigara and Jaro. Since it had no name at the time, people started calling it Tunga, the dialect for half. When it became a barrio, the residents, due to their familiarity with the name christened the place Tunga.\n\nOn March 4, 1948, \"Pag-urosa han mga Tunga-on\", the association that led the campaign to make Tunga a municipality, was organized and it elected Domingo A. Ponferrada, President; Martino Ariza, 1st Vice President; Blas Uribe, 2nd Vice President; Vicente Catenza, 3rd Vice President; Primitivo Geraldo, Secretary; Norberto Quintana, treasurer; Ramón Santillan Sr (died on October 13, 2005, at age 101) and Juan Avila, auditors; Paulo Cotoner, Magno Buñales and Arsenio Carit, Sergeants-at-Arms.\n\nThese officers invited and apprised Atilano R. Cinco, Congressman for the 5th District of Leyte, of the desire of Tunga to become an independent municipality. Cinco promised to file a bill in congress when all supporting papers that he had suggested were ready. Thus, a committee on consensus was created. Martino Ariza was elected as chairman; the members being some of the students of Tunga Institute.\n\nSubsequently, Philippine President Quirino issued Executive Order No. 266, dated September 24, 1949, creating the independent municipality of Tunga, however the appointed local officials had to assume their posts a few days after the elections.\n\nOn November 15, 1949, Provincial Board Secretary Ricardo Collantes, representing Leyte Governor Catalino Landia, proclaimed the Municipality of Tunga before a huge crowd of joyous Tunga-on and distinguished visitors.\n\nThe patron saint of Tunga is Saint Anthony of Padua. The Tunga-on celebrate their town's fiesta on August 13 every year.\n\nTunga is politically subdivided into 8 barangays:\n\n\nIn the , the population of Tunga, Leyte, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe socio-economic situation in Tunga can be described as poor with little outside investment and few opportunities for most of the municipality's citizens to improve their economic status. Income per capita is very low and the poverty incidence is alarming. The magnitude of families living below the poverty threshold is much too high. The under-employment rate is high and most people hold informal jobs and carry out various activities daily to earn barely a subsistence income for their families. The percent of households without their own dwellings is high.\n\nElementary education participation is low, reflecting low incomes because families cannot afford to put their children through school and/or children are taken out of school to assist families with income-earning activities. As a result, the simple literacy rate is low.\n\nCrop production indicates very low land productivity with the majority of farmers involved in coconut tree cultivation for copra as their main economic mainstay. Rice cultivation is the second main agricultural activity. Some farmers also raise pigs and chickens to sell to the local meat shop in the local market.\n\nThe fish catch, which is mainly Tilapia, in the Tunga River, which flows through the municipality, has decreased since 2005.\n\nThere are a total of 4 Elementary Schools and 1 Secondary/High School in Tunga Leyte\n\n\n\n"}

He was educated at South Carolina College. Along with his father and his family, he moved to Madison County, Mississippi, in September 1845 and built \"Kirkwood,\" the family's home. In June 1846, McWillie raised a company from Madison County to volunteer for service in the Mexican–American War. More than 17,000 Mississippians volunteered, but only 1,000 were called to serve in the First Mississippi Regiment under Colonel Jefferson Davis. In order to serve, Captain McWillie enlisted in the Mississippi Rifles as a private and fought as part of force that took Monterey in September 1846. When the Second Mississippi Regiment was formed under Reuben Davis, McWillie took command of the Camden Rifles and served out remainder of war, fighting at the Battle of Buena Vista. Following the Mexican-American War, McWillie returned to Kirkwood, where he was a planter.\n\nIn 1861 with the outbreak of the Civil War, he again raised the Camden Rifles, which became part of the 18th Mississippi Regiment under Col. E. R. Burt. The regiment arrived at Camp Walker, near Manassas, Virginia, on June 18, 1861, and, along with the 17th Mississippi and 5th South Carolina, was brigaded under Gen. David R. Jones. The brigade was on the extreme right of the Confederate army at Bull Run on July 21. Captain McWillie was killed by an enemy canister shot while rallying his command during an attack on the Union lines up Rocky Run. He was buried on the field alongside his nephew, Pvt. E.H. Anderson, who also was mortally wounded during the battle.\n"}

EPPO codes are a core component of a database of names, both scientific and vernacular. Although originally started by the Bayer Corporation, the official list of codes is now maintained by EPPO.\n\nAll codes and their associated names are included in a database (EPPO Global Database). In total, there are over 68,500 species listed in the EPPO database, including:\n\nPlants are identified by a five-letter code, other organisms by a six-letter one. In many cases the codes are mnemonic abbreviations of the scientific name of the organism, derived from the first three or four letters of the genus and the first two letters of the species. For example, corn, or maize (\"Zea mays\"), was assigned the code \"ZEAMA\"; the code for potato late blight (\"Phytophthora infestans\") is \"PHYTIN\". The unique and constant code for each organism provides a shorthand method of recording specie. The EPPO code avoids many of the problems caused by revisions to scientific names and taxonomy which often result in different synonyms being in use for the same species. When the taxonomy changes, the EPPO code stays the same. The EPPO system is used by governmental organizations, conservation agencies, and researchers. \n\n"}

His professional career finished after a serious injury.\n\nContractor began his first-class career, playing for the Gujarat. The captain of Gujarat Phiroz Khambata saw how Nari played in the selection trial matches for MCA's Silver Jubilee matches in 1955. He did well in the trials and expected to be selected for the matches against Pakistan Services & Bhawalpur Cricket Association. He got to the team because Captain Kambatha had dropped out. Contractor scored hundreds in both innings of his debut, becoming the second man after Arthur Morris to do so.\n\nLater he was chosen to play for India. Nari became an opener after one of the players Vinoo Mankad couldn't take part in a Test match against New Zealand at Delhi in 1955. Later he became an Indian captain.\n\nAt Lord's in 1959, he broke two ribs in the first innings by Brian Statham, despite which he scored 81. Later in the year, his 74 in the second innings at Kanpur was crucial in India winning its first Test against Australia. This innings ended when he pulled Alan Davidson, who was bowling left-arm spin at the time. Neil Harvey at short leg ducked and turned, but the ball got stuck between his legs.\n\nContractor led India to a series win against England in 1961–62 and captained the side to Caribbean the same season. There, in a tour match against Barbados at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, in March 1962, he was on 2 not out while opening the batting with Dilip Sardesai during his side's first innings, when his attention was for a moment distracted as he faced Charlie Griffith in the fourth ball of the second over. He saw somebody open a window in the pavilion, and consequently was unable to concentrate on the ball following its delivery by Griffith, seeing the ball \"just inches away before it hit\" him. Contractor took a blow at the back of his skull fracturing it. A blood clot had developed inside his skull and pressing against the brain paralyzing him from the waist down. Two surgeries were performed to remove the clot. Requiring blood transfusion for the purpose, the West Indies captain Frank Worrell donated blood, alongside Contractor's teammates Chandu Borde, Bapu Nadkarni and Polly Umrigar. Contractor's life was saved but his international career was abruptly ended as a result. In a recent interview, he mentioned as his only regret that he wanted play just \"one\" Test after the injury, but people did not want him to.\n\nAt the time Contractor was seriously injured, cricket batsmen did not wear helmets. They do now.\n\nDuring his playing days, Contractor was considered a glamour boy of Indian cricket. In an interview with Simi Garewal in 1999, former Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa stated that as a schoolgirl she had a crush on Contractor.\n\nContractor now lives in Mumbai where he coaches at the Cricket Club of India Academy.

{"id": "2174683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174683", "title": "Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas", "text": "Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas\n\nThe Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas (PUST), also known as the Angelicum in honor of its patron the \"Doctor Angelicus\" Thomas Aquinas, is a pontifical university located in the historic center of Rome, Italy. The \"Angelicum\" is administered by the Dominican Order and is the order's central locus of Thomist theology and philosophy.\n\nThe \"Angelicum\" is coeducational and offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees in theology, philosophy, canon law, and social sciences, as well as certificates and diplomas in related areas. Courses are offered in Italian and for some programs in English. The \"Angelicum\" is staffed by clergy and laity and serves both religious and lay students from around the world.\n\nThe \"Angelicum\" has its roots in the Dominican mission to study and to teach truth. This mission is reflected in the Order's motto, \"\"Veritas\"\". The distinctively pedagogical character of the Dominican apostolate as intended by Saint Dominic de Guzman in 1214 at the birth of the Order, \"the first order instituted by the Church with an academic mission,\" is succinctly expressed by another of the Order's mottos, \"contemplare et contemplata aliis tradere\", (to contemplate and to bear the fruits of contemplation to others). Pope Honorius III approved the Order of Preachers in December 1216 and January 1217. On 21 January 1217 the papal bull \"Gratiarum omnium\" confirmed the Order's pedagogical mission by granting its members the right to preach universally, a power formerly dependent on local episcopal authorization.\n\nSaint Dominic established priories focused on study and preaching that became the Order's first \"studia generalia\", at the Parisian convent of St. Jacques in 1217, at Bologna in 1218, at Palencia and Montpellier in 1220, and at Oxford before his death in 1221. By 1219 Pope Honorius III had invited Dominic and companions to take up residence at the ancient Roman basilica of Santa Sabina, which they did by early 1220. In May 1220 at Bologna the Order's first General Chapter mandated that each convent of the Order maintain a \"studium\". The official foundation of the Dominican studium conventuale at Rome, which would grow into the \"Angelicum\", occurred with the legal transfer of the Santa Sabina complex from Pope Honorius III to the Order of Preachers on 5 June 1222.\n\nSt. Hyacinth of Poland and companions Bl. Ceslaus, Herman of Germany, and Henry of Moravia were among the first to study at the \"studium\" of Santa Sabina where \"sacred studies flourished\".\n\nFrom its beginning the Santa Sabina \"studium\" played the special role of frequently providing papal theologians from among its members. Since its institution in 1218 the office of Master of the Sacred Palace has always been entrusted to a Friar of the Order of Preachers. In 1218 Saint Dominic was appointed as the first Master of the Sacred Palace by Pope Honorius III. In 1246 Pope Innocent IV appointed Annibaldo degli Annibaldi (c. 1220 – 1272) third Master of the Sacred Palace after Saint Dominic and Bartolomeo di Breganze. Annibaldi had completed his initial studies at the Santa Sabina \"studium conventuale\" and was later sent to the \"studium generale\" at Paris. Aquinas dedicated to Annibaldi the \"Catena aurea\", which he wrote during his regency at the Santa Sabina \"studium\" beginning in 1265.\n\nAt the general chapter of Valenciennes in 1259 Thomas Aquinas together with masters Bonushomo Britto, Florentius, Albert, and Peter took part in establishing a program of studies for novices and lectors including two years of philosophy, two years of fundamental theology, church history and canon law, and four years of theology. Those who showed capacity were sent on to a \"studium generale\" to complete this course becoming \"lector\", \"magister studentium\", \"baccalaureus\", and \"magister theologiae\".\n\nThe new formation program outlined at Valenciennes featured the study of philosophy as an innovation. \"In the early days there was no need to study philosophy or the arts in the Order; young men entered already trained in the humanities at the university. St. Albert received his arts training at Padua, St. Thomas at Naples; they were prepared to study theology. By 1259, however, it became evident that youths entering the Order were not sufficiently trained; the new \"ratio studiorum\" of 1259 established \"studia philosophiae\" in certain provinces corresponding to the university faculty of arts.\"\n\nIn February 1265 newly elected Pope Clement IV summoned Aquinas to Rome as papal theologian. That same year in accord with the injunction of the Chapter of the Roman province at Anagni, Aquinas was assigned as regent master at the \"studium\" at Santa Sabina: We assign Friar Thomas of Aquino to Rome, for the remission of his sins, there to take over the direction of studies.\n\nWith this assignment the \"studium\" at Santa Sabina, which had been founded in 1222, was transformed into the Order's first studium provinciale with courses under Aquinas' direction beginning 8 September 1265 and featuring \"studia philosophiae\" as prescribed by Aquinas and others at the 1259 chapter of Valenciennes.\n\nThis \"studium\" was an intermediate school between the \"studium conventuale\" and the \"studium generale\". \"Prior to this time the Roman Province had offered no specialized education of any sort, no arts, no philosophy; only simple convent schools, with their basic courses in theology for resident friars, were functioning in Tuscany and the meridionale during the first several decades of the order's life. But the new \"studium\" at Santa Sabina was to be a school for the province,\" a \"studium provinciale\". Tolomeo da Lucca, associate and early biographer of Aquinas, tells us that at Santa Sabina Aquinas taught the full range of philosophical subjects, \"teaching in a new and special way almost the whole of philosophy, both moral and natural, but especially ethical and mathematical, as well as in writing and commentary.\"\n\nWhile Regent master at the Santa Sabina \"studium provinciale\" Aquinas began to compose his monumental work, the \"Summa theologiae\", conceived of as a work suited to beginning students:Because a doctor of catholic truth ought not only to teach the proficient, but to him pertains also to instruct beginners. as the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians 3: 1-2, \"as to infants in Christ, I gave you milk to drink, not meat\", our proposed intention in this work is to convey those things that pertain to the Christian religion, in a way that is fitting to the instruction of beginners. At Santa Sabina Thomas composed the entire \"Prima Pars\" circulating it in Italy before departing for his second regency at Paris (1269–1272).\n\nOther works composed by Aquinas during this period at Santa Sabina include the \"Catena aurea in Marcum\", the \"De rationibus fidei\", the \"Catena aurea in Lucam\", the \"Quaestiones disputate de potentia Dei\", which report the disputations Aquinas held at Santa Sabina, the \"Quaestiones disputate de anima\", which were held during the academic year 1265–66, \"Expositio et lectura super epistolas Pauli Apostoli\", the \"Compendium theologiae\", the \"Responsio de 108 articulis\", part of the \"Quaestiones disputatae de malo\", the \"Catena aurea in Ioannem\", the \"De regno ad regem Cypri\", the \"Quaestiones disputatae de spiritualibus creaturis\", and at least the first book of the \"Sententia Libri De anima\", a commentary on Aristotle's \"De anima\". This work by Aristotle was contemporaneously being translated from the Greek by Aquinas' Dominican associate at Viterbo William of Moerbeke in 1267.\n\nThe so-called \"lectura romana\" or \"alia lectura fratris Thome\", a \"reportatio\" of the second commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard dictated by Aquinas at the Santa Sabina \"studium provinciale\", may have been taken down by Jacob of Ranuccio while a student of Aquinas there from 1265 to 1268. Jacob later was lector at Santa Sabina and served in the Roman Curia being made bishop in 1286, the year of his death.\n\nNicholas Brunacci (1240–1322) was among Aquinas' students at the Santa Sabina \"studium provinciale\" and later at Paris. In November 1268 he accompanied Aquinas and his associate and secretary Reginald of Piperno from Viterbo to Paris to begin the academic year. Albert the Great, Brunacci's teacher at Cologne after 1272, called him \"the second Thomas Aquinas.\" Brunacci became lector at the Santa Sabina \"studium\" and later served in the papal curia. He was a correspondent by letter with Dante Alighieri during the latter's exile from Florence.\n\nAfter the departure of Aquinas for Paris in 1268 other lectors at the Santa Sabina \"studium\" include Hugh Aycelin. Eventually some of the pedagogical activities of the Santa Sabina \"studium\" were transferred to a new convent of the Order more centrally located at the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. This convent had a modest beginning in 1255 as a community for women converts, but grew rapidly in size and importance during its transfer to the Dominicans from 1265 to 1275. In 1288 the theology component of the provincial curriculum was relocated from the Santa Sabina \"studium provinciale\" to the \"studium conventuale\" at Santa Maria sopra Minerva which was redesignated as a \"studium particularis theologiae\". During this period lectors at the Santa Maria sopra Minerva \"studium\" included Niccolò da Prato, Bartolomeo da San Concordio, and Matteo Orsini.\n\nFollowing the curriculum of studies laid out in the capitular acts of 1291 the Santa Sabina \"studium\" was redesignated as one of three \"studia nove logice\" intended to offer courses of advanced logic covering the \"logica nova\", the Aristotelian texts recovered in the West only in the second half of the 12th century, the \"Topics\", \"Sophistical Refutations\", and the \"First and Second Analytics\" of Aristotle. This was an advance over the \"logica antiqua\", which treated the \"Isagoge of Porphyry\", \"Divisions\" and \"Topics\" of Boethius, the \"Categories\" and \"On Interpretation\" of Aristotle, and the \"Summule logicales\" of Peter of Spain. In 1305 the Minerva \"studium\" became one of four \"studia naturarum\" established in the Roman province. Iacopo Passavanti, famed preacher and author of the \"Specchio di vera penitenza\", was lector at the \"studium\" at Santa Maria sopra Minerva after finishing his studies in Paris c. 1333.\n\nThe General Chapter of 1304 mandated each of the Order's provinces establish a \"studium generale\" to meet the demand of the Order's rapidly growing membership. The \"studium\" at Santa Maria sopra Minerva was raised to the level of \"studium generale\" for the Roman province of the Order by the year 1426 and continued in this roll until 1539. It would again be affirmed as a \"studium generale\" in 1694 (see below).\n\nOn 7 March 1457, the feast of St. Thomas, humanist Lorenzo Valla delivered the annual encomium in honor of the \"angelic doctor.\" The Dominicans of the Minerva \"studium generale\" pressed Valla not only to praise Aquinas but to voice his humanist criticism of scholastic thomism.\n\nSisto Fabri served as professor of theology at the Santa Maria sopra Minerva \"studium\" in the mid 1550s. In 1585 Fabri, who was Master of the Order of Preachers from 1583-1598 would undertake a reformation of the program of studies for the Order and for the \"studium\" which had been transformed into the College of St. Thomas in 1577. Fabri's reform included a nine-year formation program consisting of two years of logic using the \"Summulae logicales\" of Peter of Spain alongside Aristotle's logic, three years of philosophy including the study of Aristotle's \"De anima\", \"Physica\", and \"Metaphysica\", and four years of theology using the third part of Aquinas' \"Summa\" for speculative theology, and the second part for moral theology. Fabri also established a professorship for the study of Hebrew at the College.\n\nIn 1570 the first edition of Aquinas' opera omnia, the so-called \"editio piana\" from Pius V the Dominican Pope who commissioned it, was produced there.\n\nThe late sixteenth century saw the \"studium\" at Santa Maria sopra Minerva undergo further transformation during the pontificate of Pope Gregory XIII. Aquinas, who had been canonized in 1323 by Pope John XXII, was proclaimed fifth Latin Doctor of the Church by Pius V in 1567. To honor this great doctor, in 1577 Juan Solano, former bishop of Cusco, Peru, generously funded the reorganization of the \"studium\" at the convent of the Minerva on the model of the College of St. Gregory at Valladolid in his native Spain. The features of this Spanish model included a fixed number of Dominican students admitted on the basis of intellectual merit, dedicated exclusively to study in virtue of numerous dispensations from other duties, and governed by an elected Rector.\n\nThe result of Solano's initiative, which underwent further structural change shortly before Solano's death in 1580, was the \"Collegium Divi Thomae\" or College of St. Thomas. At the Minerva the College occupied several existing convent structures as well as new constructions. A detail from the Nolli Map of 1748 gives some idea of the disposition of buildings when the Minerva convent housed the College.\n\nThe College cultivated the doctrines of St. Thomas Aquinas as a means of carrying out the Church's mission in the New World, where Solano had shown \"much zeal in defending the rights of the Indians\", and where Dominicans like Bartolomé de las Casas, \"Protector of the Indians\", Pedro de Cordova, critic of the Encomienda system, and Francisco de Vitoria, theorist of international law, were already engaged.\n\nAt the beginning of the seventeenth century several regents of the College of St. Thomas were involved in controversies over the nature of divine grace. Diego Alvarez (1550 c.-1635), author of the \"De auxiliis divinae gratiae et humani arbitrii viribus\" and famous apologist for the Thomistic doctrines of grace and predestination, was professor of theology at the College from 1596 to 1606. Tomas de Lemos (Ribadavia 1540 - Rome 1629). was professor of theology at the College in 1610. In the Molinist controversy between Dominicans and Jesuits the papal commission or Congregatio de Auxiliis summoned Lemos and Diego Alvarez to represent the Dominican Order in debates before Pope Clement VIII and Pope Paul V. Lemos was editor of the \"Acta omnium congregationum ac disputationum, etc.\" and author of the much discussed \"Panoplia gratiae\" (1676). In 1608 Juan Gonzalez de Albelda, author of the \"Commentariorum & disputationum in primam partem Summa S. Thome de Aquino\" (1621) was regent of studies at the College. In the 1620s Juan Gonzales de Leon was regent Concerning the dispute on the nature of divine grace he took up an alternative doctrine within the Thomist school, that of Juan Gonzalez d'Albeda regent at the College in 1608, that \"sufficient grace not only prepares the will for a perfect act [of contrition], but also gives the will an impulse towards that act. Yet due to man's defectability that impulse is always resisted.\"\n\nThe College maintained the Dominican tradition of textual and linguistic activities as part of the Order's missionary dimension. Like Moerbeke's translations of Aristotle in the 1260s and the \"editio piana\" of 1570 (see above), editorial and translation projects were undertaken by the college's professors, the most notable of which would be the \"leonine edition\" of Aquinas' works (see below). Vincenzo Candido (1573-1654) presided over the translation of the Bible into Arabic. Candido had entered the Order at the convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva completing there his novitiate and studies and becoming a doctor of theology, and later rector of the College in 1630. Candido also was part of the commission that concemned Jansenism. His own \"Disquisitionibus moralibus\" (1643) was later accused of laxims. Giuseppe Ciante (d. 1670), a leading Hebrew expert of his day and author of works such as the \"De sanctissima trinitate ex antiquorum Hebraeorum testimonijs euidenter comprobata\" (1667) and \"De Sanctissima incarnatione clarissimis Hebraeorum doctrinis...defensa\" (1667), completed his studies at the college was professor of theology and philosophy there before 1640. \"In 1640 Ciantes was appointed by Pope Urban VIII to the mission of preaching to the Jews of Rome (\"Predicatore degli Ebrei\") in order to promote their conversion.\" In the mid-1650s Ciantes wrote a \"monumental bilingual edition of the first three Parts of Thomas Aquinas' \"Summa contra Gentiles\", which includes the original Latin text and a Hebrew translation prepared by Ciantes, assisted by Jewish apostates, the \"Summa divi Thomae Aquinatis ordinis praedicatorum Contra Gentiles quam Hebraicè eloquitur…\". Until the present this remains the only significant translation of a major Latin scholastic work in modern Hebrew.\"\n\nTommaso Caccini (1574–1648), one of the principal critics of Galileo Galilei, was baccalaureaus at the College in 1615.\n\nSeveral figures associated with the College during this period were involved in the defense of the doctrine of Papal infallibility. Dominic Gravina, the most celebrated theologian of his day in Italy, was professor of theology at the College in 1610. Gravina was made master of sacred theology by the General Chapter of the Order at Rome in 1608. He wrote \"Vox turturis seu de florenti usque ad nostra tempora ... sacrarum Religionum statu\" (1625) in polemic with Robert Bellarmine whose \"De gemitu columbae\" (1620) criticized the decadence of religious orders. Gravina, wrote concerning Papal infallibility: \"To the Pontiff, as one (person) and alone, it was given to be the head;\" and again, \"The Roman Pontiff for the time beingis one, therefore he alone has infallibility.\"\n\nIn 1630 Abraham Bzovius funded a scholarship for Polish students at the College.\n\nVicente Ferre (+1682), author of the \"Commentaria scholastica in Div. Thomam\" (1691) as well as of several commentaries on the Summa Theologica was Regent of College from 1654 to 1672. Ferre was recognized by his contemporaries as one of the leading Thomists of his day. In his \"De Fide\" Ferre writes in defense of Papal infallibility that Christ said \"I have prayed for thee, Peter; sufficiently showing that the infallibility was not promised to the Church as apart from (seorsum) the head, but promised to the head, that from him it should be derived to the Church.\"\n\nIn the late seventeenth century figures such as Gregorio Selleri who taught at the college were instrumental in fostering the condemnation of Jansenism\n\nAt the general chapter of Rome in 1694 Antonin Cloche, Master General of the Dominican Order, reaffirmed the College of St. Thomas as the \"studium generale\" of the Roman province of the Order.We institute as a \"studium generale\" of this province...the Roman College of St. Thomas at our convent of Santa Maria sopra MinervaAt this time the College became an international centre of Thomistic specialization open to members of various provinces of the Dominican Order and to other ecclesiastical students, local and foreign.\n\nIn 1698, Cardinal Girolamo Casanata, Librarian of the Holy Roman Church, established the \"Biblioteca Casanatense\" at the Convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. This library was independent of the College of St. Thomas, sponsoring its own Librarians. Casanate also endowed 4 chairs of learning at the College to foster the study of Greek, Hebrew and Dogmatic Theology.\n\nWith the papal bull \"Pretiosus\" dated 26 May 1727 Dominican Pope Benedict XIII granted to all Dominicans major houses of study the right of conferring academic degrees in theology to students outside the Order.\n\nIn the 1748 General Chapter or the Order at Bologna it was stated that the Thomistic philosophical and theological tradition needed to be revived. In 1757 Master General Juan Tomás de Boxadors composed a letter to all members of the Order lamenting deviations from Thomistic doctrine, and demanded a return to the teachings of Aquinas. This letter was also published in the General Chapter Acts in Rome 1777. Responding to Boxadors and to the prevailing philosophical rationalism of the Enlightenment, Salvatore Roselli, professor of theology at the Roman College of St. Thomas, published a six volume \"Summa philosophica\" (1777) giving an Aristotelian interpretation of Aquinas validating the senses as a source of knowledge. While teaching at the college Roselli is considered to have laid the foundation for Neothomism in the nineteenth century. According to historian J.A. Weisheipl in the late 18th and early 19th centuries \"everyone who had anything to do with the revival of Thomism in Italy, Spain and France was directly influenced by Roselli's monumental work.\n\nAfter the Church's loss of the temporal power in 1870 the Italian government declared the college's vast library national property leavning the Dominicans in charge only until 1884.\n\nVincenzo Nardini (d. 1913) completed his theological and philosophical studies at the College and became lector there in 1855 teaching mathematics, experimental physics, chemistry and astronomy. Nardini reorganized the institute of science founded at the College in 1840 by Albert Gugliemotti. He believed the doctrines of Aquinas to be the only means to reconcile science and faith. Nardini was a founding member of the Accademia Romana di San Tommaso in 1879. Between 1901 and 1902 he also founded an astronomical observatory on via di Pie' di Marmo in Rome. In 1904 as Provincial of the Order's Roman province he proposed that the College be transformed into an international university. This was accomplished in 1908 by his successors.\nGian Battista Embriaco (Ceriana 1829 – Rome 1903) taught at the college. Embriaco was the inventor in 1867 of the hydrochronometer, examples of which were built in Rome, first in the College's courtyard at the Minerva, and later on the Pincian Hill and in the Villa Borghese gardens. Embriaco had presented two prototypes of his invention at the Paris Universal Exposition in 1867 winning prizes and acclaim.\n\nThe suppression of religious orders soon hampered the mission of the College. During the French occupation of Rome from 1797 to 1814 the College was in declined and briefly closed its doors from 1810 to 1815. The Order gained control of the convent once again in 1815.\n\nBy the late eighteenth century professors of the College had begun to follow the Wolffianism and Eclecticism of Austrian Jesuit, Sigismund von Storchenau and Jaime Balmes with the aim of engaging modern thought. In response to this trend the General Chapter of 1838 again ordered the revival of Thomism and the use of the Summa Theologica at the College of St. Thomas.\n\nAt the Minerva the Master of the Order issued a directive to re-establish the plan of study that had been in force before the French Revolution following the manual of Salvatore Roselli (1777–83) and prescribing a 5-year study of the \"Summa theologica\" for all degree candidates. The Minerva \"studium generale\" was refurbished, and a new era of Thomism was initiated led by luminaries such as Tommaso Maria Zigliara.\n\nAfter the Capture of Rome, the final act of the Risorgimento, the Dominicans were expropriated by the Italian government in virtue of law 1402 of 19 June 1873 and the \"Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe\" was forced to leave the Minerva. The College continued its work at various locations in Rome. Rector Zigliara, who taught at the College from 1870 to 1879, with his professors and students took refuge with the Fathers of the Holy Ghost at the French College in Rome, where lectures continued. In 1899 the College was functioning in the Palazzo Sinibaldi, adjacent to the French College and near the Convent of the Minerva.\n\nThe mid-19th-century revival of Thomism, sometimes called \"Neo-Scholasticism\" or \"Neo-Thomism,\" had its origins in Italy. \"The direct initiator of the neo-Scholastic movement in Italy was Gaetano Sanseverino, (1811–1865), a canon at Naples.\" Other prominent figures include Zigliara, Josef Kleutgen, and Giovanni Cornoldi. The revival emphasizes the interpretative tradition of Aquinas' great commentators such as Capréolus, Cajetan, and John of St. Thomas. Its focus, however, is less exegetical and more concerned with carrying out the program of deploying a rigorously worked out system of Thomistic metaphysics in a wholesale critique of modern philosophy. Zigliara was instrumental in recovering the authentic tradition of Thomism from the influence of a tradition of the Jesuits' that was \"strongly colored by the interpretation of their own great master Francisco Suárez (d. 1617), who had attempted to reconcile the Aristotelianism of Thomas with the Platonism of Scotus\" \n\nIn response to the disarray of religious educational institutions Pope Leo XIII in his encyclical \"Aeterni Patris\" of 4 August 1879 called for the renewal of Christian philosophy and particularly the doctrines of Aquinas:We exhort you, venerable brethren, in all earnestness to restore the golden wisdom of St. Thomas, and to spread it far and wide for the defense and beauty of the Catholic faith, for the good of society, and for the advantage of all the sciences. Pope Leo XIII's encyclical \"Aeterni Patris\" of 1879 was a great impetus to the revival of neo scholastic Thomism. On 15 October 1879 Leo created the Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas and ordered publication of a critical edition of the complete works of the \"doctor angelicus\". Superintendence of the \"leonine edition\" was entrusted to Zigliara. Leo also founded the \"Angelicum's\" Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of Canon Law in 1896. The College began once again to gain status and influence. Under Pope Leo XIII Zigliara contributed to the encyclicals \"Aeterni Patris\" and \"Rerum novarum\".\n\nIn response to the call for a renewal of Thomism sounded by \"Aeterni Patris\" rectors Tommaso Maria Zigliara (1833–1893), Alberto Lepidi (1838–1922), and Sadoc Szabó had brought the college to a high degree of excellence. Under the leadership of Szabó the number of subjects taught at the \"Angelicum\" included archeology, geology, paleography, Christian art, biology, mathematics, physics, and astronomy.\n\nAt the dawn of the twentieth century the Dominican conception of intellectual formation at Rome was again transformed. The general chapters of 1895 (Avila) and 1901 (Ghent) had called for the expansion of the College of St. Thomas to meet the growing educational needs in the modern world. The Chapter of 1904 (Viterbo) directed Hyacinthe-Marie Cormier (1832–1916), newly elected Master General of the Order of Preachers, to develop the College into a \"studium generalissimum\" directly under his authority for the entire Dominican Order:Romae erigatur collegium studiorum Ordinis generalissimum, auctoritate magistri generalis immediate subjectum, in quo floreat vita regularis, et ad quod mittantur fratres ex omnibus provinciis. Building on the legacy of the Order's first Roman \"studium\" at the priory of Santa Sabina founded in 1222 and the \"studium general\" that had sprung from it by 1426 at Santa Maria sopra Minerva and that in 1577 became the College of Saint Thomas, Cormier stated his intention to establish this new \"studium generalissimum\" as the principal vehicle of dissemination of orthodox Thomistic thought for both Dominicans and secular clergy.\n\nIn 1904 Pope Pius X allowed diocesan seminarians to attend the college. He elevated the College to the status of \"Pontificium\" on 2 May 1906, making its degrees equivalent to those of the world's other pontifical universities. By Apostolic Letter of 8 November 1908, signed on 17 November, the Pope transformed the College into the \"Collegium Pontificium Internationale Angelicum\", located on Via San Vitale 15. Cormier developed the \"Angelicum\" until his death in 1916, establishing it principal guidelines, giving it his motto as Master General, \"caritas veritatis\", \"the charity of truth.\" Cormier, also noted for the spiritual quality of his retreats and powerful preaching, was declared Blessed by Pope John Paul II on 20 November 1994.\n\nIn the first half of the twentieth century \"Angelicum\" professors Edouard Hugon, Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange and others carried on Leo's call for a Thomist revival. The core philosophical commitments of the revival, which after Zigliara traditionally are those of the \"Angelicum\", were later summarized in “Twenty-Four Thomistic Theses” approved by Pope Pius X. Due to its rejection of attempts to synthesize Thomism with non-Thomistic categories and assumptions neo-scholastic Thomism has sometimes been called “Strict Observance Thomism.”\n\nIn 1909 there were 26 professors. Beyond philosophy and theology subject included archeology, geology, paleography, Christian art, biology, mathematics, physics, and astronomy. In 1917 a professorship in ascetical and mystical theology was created at the \"Angelicum\" expressly for Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange. This was the first of its kind in the world, and Garrigou-Lagrange initiated courses in sacred art, mysticism, and aesthetics in 1918. Marie Alain Couturier studied with Garrigou at the Angelicum from 1930 to 1932 before going on to have an instrumental role in liturgical art ventures such as Henri Matisse's Vence Chapel and Le Corbusier's Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut, and the Dominican priory of Sainte Marie de La Tourette.\n\nGarrigou-Lagrange has been called \"torchbearer of orthodox Thomism\" against Modernism in the period between World War II and the Cold War. He is commonly held to have influenced the decision in 1942 to place the privately circulated book \"Une école de théologie: le Saulchoir\" (Étiolles 1937) by Marie-Dominique Chenu on the Vatican's \"Index of Forbidden Books\" as the culmination of a polemic within the Dominican Order between the \"Angelicum\" supporters of a speculative scholasticism and the French revival Thomists who were more attentive to historical hermeneutics, such as Yves Congar. Congar's \"Chrétiens désunis\" was also suspected of modernism because its methodology derived more from religious experience than from syllogistic analysis.\n\nNoted philosopher and theologian Santiago Maria Ramirez y Ruiz de Dulanto (1891-1967) completed his licentiate and doctorate in philosophy at the \"Angelicum\" from 1913 to 1917 with a dissertation entitled \"De quidditate Incarnationis\", becoming lector on 27 June 1917 and teaching there from 1917 to 1920. Ramirez relates that he was fortunate during his student years to hear Pope Pius X deliver a talk to the professors and students at the \"Angelicum\" on 28 June 1914 in which the Pontiff extolled Aquinas' doctrines above those of all others, and another talk delivered by Pope Pius XI at the \"Angelicum\" on 12 December 1924 in which he reaffirmed the doctrinal authority of St. Thomas Aquinas.\n\n29 June 1923 on the occasion of the sixth centenary of the canonization of Thomas Aquinas Pius XI's encyclical \"Studiorum ducem\" singled out the Pontifical Angelicum College as the official \"sedes Thomae\":It will be fitting...that the institutes where sacred studies are cultivated express their holy joy, before all the Pontifical Angelicum College where Thomas could be said to dwell in his own house, and then all the other ecclesiastial schools that are in Rome. The reputation of the College during this period was summed up by one of the \"Angelicum's\" most illustrious alumni and faculty members in the mid-twentieth century, Cornelio Fabro, who called the \"Angelicum\" the \"avant-garde of the doctrinal mission of the Dominican Order in Rome, and of traditional Thomism whose distinguished exponents included T. Zigliara, A. Lepidi, T. Pègues, E. Hugon, A. Zacchi, R. Garrigou-Lagrange, and M. Cordovani.\" The notoriety of the College was further fostered by annual celebrations of the Feast of its patron St. Thomas Aquinas including a \"preaching tridiuum\", a pontifical Mass and an academic symposium at the \"Angelicum\" 8 June 1923 Szabó founded \"Unio thomistica\", an association of \"Angelicum\" students and alumni dedicated to defense of Thomistic doctrine. Its publication originally entitled \"Unio thomistica\" would continue under the title \"Angelicum\", a trimesterly journal with articles in Italian, French, English, German, and Spanish treating theology, philosophy, canon law, and social sciences.\nThe year 1926 saw the \"Angelicum\" become an institute with its change of name to \"Pontificium Institutum Internationale Angelicum\". During the academic year 1927-28 \"Angelicum\" professor Mariano Cordovani began a \"Philosophy Circle\" that continued into the 1960s as a forum for laity to explore contemporary philosophical issues.\n\nIn 1927 the Italian government decided to sell the former convent of Santi Domenico e Sisto. The convent, which had been established by Pope Pius V for Dominican nuns in 1575, was expropriated by the Italian government on 9 September 1871 in virtue of the law of suppression of religious orders. Blessed Buenaventura García de Paredes, Master General of the Order, seeing the opportunity to recuperate the Dominican patrimony, suggested to Benito Mussolini that selling the convent to the Order would return the property to its original owners, and that it could be used to house the \"Angelicum\"\n\nBy decree of 2 June 1928 the Italian Minister of Justice authorized the College of St. Thomas to purchase from the Italian State for the agreed price of nine million lire (L. 9,000,000) the complex of buildings constituting the former convent of Saints Dominic and Sixtus\n\nIn 1930 Étienne Gilson and Jacques Maritain were the first two philosophers to receive honorary doctorates from the \"Angelicum\".\n\nFor the academic year 1928-1929 Paredes celebrated the inaugural Mass in the Church of Saints Dominic and Sixtus and Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange gave the solemn inaugural lecture. Because the convent buildings required extensive renovation classes were not held there until 1932.\n\nFrom 1928 to 1932 the convent was renovated to house classrooms, an \"aula magna\" and an \"aula minor\", amphitheaters with seating capacities of 1,100 and 350 respectively. In November 1932 the \"Angelicum\" opened its doors at the appropriately more extensive complex of buildings comprising the ancient Dominican convent of Saints Dominic and Sixtus.\n\nCardinal Eugenio Pacelli the future Pope Pius XII gave a lecture at the college entitled \"La Presse et L'Apostolat\" on 17 April 1936.\n\nThe \"Angelicum\" changed names once again in 1942 becoming the \"Pontificium Athenaeum Internationale Angelicum\".\n\nIn 1951 the Institute of Social Sciences was founded within the Faculty of Philosophy by Raimondo Spiazzi (1918–2002). Spiazzi, a prolific author and editor of the works of Aquinas, completed his doctorate in Sacred Theology at the \"Angelicum\" in 1947 with a dissertation entitled \" \"Il cristianesimo perfezione dell'uomo\". Spiazzi directed the Institute of Social Sciences until 1957 and continued teaching there until 1972. This Institute was established as the Faculty Faculty of Social Sciences (FASS) in 1974. Mieczysław Albert Krąpiec, leading exponent of the Lublin School of Philosophy in Poland, received a doctorate in theology from the \"Angelicum\" in 1948.\n\nIn 1950 the \"Angelicum's\" Institute of Spirituality was founded by Paul-Pierre Philippe within the Faculty of Theology to promote scientific and systematic study of ascetical and mystical theology, and to offer preparation for spiritual directors. The Institute was approved by the Congregation for Catholic Education on 1 May 1958. Today the Institute is presided over by Paul Murray, lecturer in Spiritual Theology at the \"Angelicum\". Murry was awarded the \"Magister Sacrae Theologiae\" by the Master General of the Order on 20 September 2011.\n\nDuring the tenure of Michael Browne as Master of the Order of Preachers and Chancellor of the \"Angelicum\", Pope Pius XII addressed the academic community of the \"Angelicum\" in a radio message on 14 January 1957. The pontiff encouraged the \"Angelicum's\" diligent pursuit of Thomistic doctrine and imparted his apostolic blessing on its future projects.\n\nBenedict Augustine Blank, former Provincial of the Western Province of the Dominican Order was rector of the \"Angelicum\" from 1952 to 1955.\n\nEnrollment climbed from 120 in 1909 to over 1,000 during the 1960s. During the tenure of Aniceto Fernández as Master of the Order of Preachers (1962–1974) and the rectorate of Raymond Sigmond (1961–1964) Pope John XXIII visited the \"Angelicum\" on 7 March 1963, the feast of the University's patron Saint Thomas Aquinas and with the \"motu proprio\" \"Dominicanus Ordo\", raised the \"Angelicum\" to the rank of pontifical university. Thereafter it would be known as the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas in the City ().\n\nOn 29 November 1963, Egyptian scholar and peritus at Vatican II for Christian–Islamic relations Georges Anawati delivered a lecture entitled at the \"Angelicum\" \"L'Islam a l'heure du Concile: prolegomenes a un dialogue islamo-chretien.\"\nOn 19 April 1974 Pope Paul VI delivered an allocution in the \"Angelicum's\" Aula Magna as part of the International Congress of the International Society of St. Thomas Aquinas celebrated on the occasion of the 7th Centenary of the death of the \"Doctor Angelicus\". The Pontif described Aquinas as a teacher of the art of thinking well and expounded his doctrine proposing Aquinas as an unsurpassed master.\n\nOn 17 November 1979, one year into his papacy, Pope John Paul II visited his alma mater to deliver an address marking the first centenary of the encyclical Aeterni Patris. The Pontiff reaffirmed the centrality of Aquinas' thought for the Church and the unique role of the \"Angelicum\", where Aquinas is \"as in his own home (\"tamquam in domo sua\"),\" in carrying on the Thomist philosophical and theological tradition.\n\nOn 24 November 1994, four days after beatifying Hyacinthe-Marie Cormier, Pope John Paul II visited the \"Angelicum\" and gave an address to faculty and students on the occasion of the dedication of the university's \"Aula Magna\" in his honor.\n\nToday the faculty and students of the \"Angelicum\" strive to be \"modern disciples of Thomas Aquinas\", \"accepting all the radical changes\" of the modern world \"but without compromise\" to the ideals of their patron Thomas Aquinas. \"Angelicum\" alumnus and famed historian and philosopher James A. Weisheipl notes that since the time of Aquinas \"Thomism was always alive in the Dominican Order, small as it was after the ravages of the Reformation, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic occupation. While outside the order Thomism has had varying fortunes, the \"Angelicum\" has played a central role throughout its history in preserving Thomism since the time of Aquinas' own activity at the Santa Sabina \"studium provinciale\". Today the \"sedes Thomae\" continues to provide students and scholars with the opportunity to immerse themselves in the authentic Dominican Thomistic philosophical and theological tradition.\n\nAs of August 2014 the student body comprised approximately 1010 students coming from 95 countries. About one half of the \"Angelicum's\" students are enrolled in the faculty of theology.\n\nAs of August 2014 the student body consisted of approximately 29% women, 71% men. Of these, approximately 24% were lay, 27% were diocesan clerical, and 49% were members of religious orders. Moreover, 30% of the student body hailed from North America, 25% from Europe, 21% from Asia, 12% from Africa, 11% from Latin America, and 1% from Oceania.\n\nSome comparatively recent notable figures associated with the \"Angelicum\" include Cornelio Fabro, Jordan Aumann, Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, Aidan Nichols, Wojciech Giertych, Theologian of the Pontifical Household under Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis, and Bishop Charles Morerod, past \"Rector Magnificus\" of the \"Angelicum\" and former Secretary of the International Theological Commission, Alejandro Crosthwaite, OP, Dean of the \"Angelicum\" Faculty of Social Sciences, and Consultant to the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, and Robert Christian, Vice-Dean of the faculty of theology, professor of sacramental theology and ecclesiology, and Consultant to the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. Dr. Donna Orsuto, professor of spirituality, is rector of the Lay Centre at Foyer Unitas and was recently created a Dame of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope Benedict.\n\nThe \"Angelicum\" is one of the world's Pontifical universities. Specifically, a pontifical university addresses \"Christian revelation and disciplines correlative to the evangelical mission of the Church as set out in the apostolic constitution, \"Sapientia christiana\"\".\n\nIn distinction to secular or other Catholic universities, which address a broad range of disciplines, Ecclesiastical or Pontifical universities are \"usually composed of three principal ecclesiastical faculties, theology, philosophy, and canon law, and at least one other faculty\". Current international quality ranking services do not have rankings for pontifical universities that are specific to their curricula.\n\nSince 19 September 2003 the Holy See has taken part in the Bologna Process, a series of meetings and agreements between European states designed to foster comparable quality standards in higher education, and in the \"Bologna Follow-up Group\".\n\nThe Holy See's \"Agency for the Evaluation and Promotion of Quality in Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties\" (AVEPRO) was established on 19 September 2007 by the Pope Benedict XVI \"to promote and develop a culture of quality within the academic institutions that depend directly on the Holy See and ensure they possess internationally valid quality criteria.\"\n\n\n\nIn addition to the programs listed, which are in the Italian language, the \"Angelicum\" offers English programs in Philosophy and Theology for the first cycle, and part of the second and third cycles.\n\nTheology\n\nSections:\n\nChairs of Learning:\n\nCanon Law\n\nPhilosophy\n\nSocial Sciences\n\nChairs of Learning:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Russell Berrie Fellowship in Interreligious Studies targets members of the laity and clergy for the purpose of studying at the \"Angelicum\" to obtain License or Doctoral Degrees in Theology with a concentration in Inter-religious Studies. The goal of the Fellowship Program is to build bridges between Christian, Jewish, and other religious traditions by providing the next generation of religious leaders with a comprehensive understanding of and dedication to interfaith issues. The award will provide one year of financial support the Russell Berrie Foundation, which carries on the values and passions of the late Russell Berrie, by promoting the continuity of the Jewish tradition, and fostering religious understanding and pluralism. Financial support is intended to cover tuition, a living stipend, examination fees, a book allowance, and travel expenses to and from the recipient's home country once a year.\n\nThe William E. Simon Scholarship Fund provides financial assistance for academically qualified students who live in Rome and who would otherwise lack the resources to cover their educational expenses at the \"Angelicum\". Each scholarship award provides no more than 40% of the total annual expense of tuition, room, board, and related fees and expenses. Annually the fund allocates 50% of its scholarships for lay students.\n\nInternational Dominican Foundation (IDF) is a non-profit organization that provides monetary support to Dominican educational programs at the Jerusalem École Biblique, the \"Angelicum\" in Rome, and the Dominican Institute for Oriental Studies (IDEO)in Cairo. The IDF made grants of approximately $270,000.00 for the academic year 2011–2012, the major part of which went the \"Angelicum\" in accord with the William E. Simon Scholarship, the McCadden-McQuirk Foundation, and the Réginald de Rocquois Foundation.\n\nThe \"Angelicum\" is listed under schools in Rome that can participate in the US Federal Loan Program.\n\nThe regular academic year at the \"Angelicum\" runs from early October until the end of May. Some of the University's important annual events are as follows:\n\nOctober Solemn Inauguration of the Academic Year and Mass of the Holy Spirit\n\n22 October Solemnity of the Dedication of the Church of Saints Dominic and Sixtus\n\n15 November Feast of Saint Albert the Great.\n\n7 March Feast of the University's patron Saint Thomas Aquinas\n\n21 May Solemn Mass for the Ending of the Academic Year and Conferral of academic degrees. Dominican feast of Bl. Hyacinthe-Marie Cormier\n\nJune A summer session runs for the month of June.\n\nGenerally administration offices remain open until the end of July, are closed for the month of August, and reopen in early September.\n\nThe \"Angelicum\" campus is located in the historic center of Rome, Italy on the Quirinal hill in the section or \"rione\" of the eternal city known as \"Monti\". It is situated near the beginning of \"via Nazionale\" just above the ruins of Trajan's Market, the \"via dei Fori Imperiali\", and \"Piazza Venezia\".\n\nThe site of the \"Angelicum\" is recorded in history sometime before the year 1000 bearing the name \"Magnanapoli\" with a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The nature of the site before the 9th century is uncertain. One theory holds that its name \"Magnanapoli\" derives from the expression \"Bannum Nea Polis\" or \"fort of the new city\" from the adjacent Byzantine military citadel which included the Torre delle Milizie Rome's oldest extant tower.\n\nIn 1569 Dominican Pope Pius V ordered the construction of the Church of Saints Dominic and Sixtus. This was followed in 1575 by a convent for Dominican nuns. Among the architects who worked on the complex are Vignola; Giacomo della Porta; Nicola and Orazio Torriani; and Vincenzo della Greca. The church's double staircase was added in 1654 by sculptor architect Orazio Torriani.\n\nIn 1870 the religious community was expropriated by the Italian government. The Order was able to reacquire the complex in 1927 from the Italian government. After extensive renovation and additions the \"Angelicum\" and a convent of Dominican Friars was installed there. Today the University occupies approximately the entire ground level of the complex. The remaining portion, approximately the second and third levels around the cloister together with subterranean spaces, constitutes a convent for the community of Dominican Friars that serves the University.\n\nThe main entrance of the \"Angelicum\" immediately to the right of the Church of Saints Dominic and Sixtus was built into the existing structure in the early 1930s as part of the renovations undertaken to accommodate the \"Angelicum\" at its new site. A wide flight of stairs leads to a Palladian motif portico above which are mounted a Dominican shield bearing one of the Order's mottos \"laudare, benedicere, praedicare\" (to praise, bless, and preach) on the right, and the escutcheons of Pope Pius XI who was reigning when the \"Pontificium Institutum Internationale Angelicum\" opened its doors in 1932, on the left. The main entrance of the \"Angelicum\" was used in 2010 as a location in the film \"Manuale d'amore 3\". part of a 4 movie romantic comedy, directed by Giovanni Veronesi and starring Robert De Niro, and Monica Bellucci who were on campus shooting the film.\n\nUnder the entrance portico are two statues c. 1910 by sculptor Cesare Aureli (1843-1923) of St Albert the Great on the left and St. Thomas Aquinas on the right. The base of the statue of Aquinas bears an inscription attributed to Pope Pius XI, \"Sanctus Thomas Doctor angelicus hic tamquam domi suae habitat,\" (Saint Thomas the Angelic Doctor dwells here as in his own house), a paraphrase of the papal encyclical \"Studiorum ducem\" that singles out the \"Angelicum\" as the preeminent Thomistic center of learning: \"ante omnia Pontificium Collegium Angelicum, ubi Thomam tamquam domi suae habitare dixeris\".\n\nThe Angelicum's statue of Aquinas is Aureli's second version of this work. The first version of 1889 looms majestically over the \"Sala di Consultazione\" or main reference room of the Vatican Library. At the instigation of the Pontifical Roman Seminary the Vatican version of the statue was commissioned in the name of all seminaries of the world as a gift to Pope Leo XIII in celebration of his episcopal jubilee in 1893. The statue has been described in the following terms:St. Thomas seated, in his left arm holds the \"Summa theologica\" while extending his right arm in the act of protecting Christian science. Thus, he does not sit on the cathedra of a doctor but on the throne of a sovereign protector; he extends his arm to reassure, not to demonstrate. He wears on his head the doctoral \"birettum\" of the traditional type which reveals the face and expression of a profoundly educated person... The immortal book that he clutches, the powerful arm that extends to affirm sacred science and to halt the audacity of error, are truly grand, and in the words of Leo XIII, have equaled the genius of all other great teachers.\n\nOn the occasion of the blessing of this statue in 1914 Hyacinthe-Marie Cormier delivered his \"Sed Contra: Allocution aux novices étudiants du Collège Angélique pour la bénédiction d'une statue de S. Thomas d'Aquin dans leur oratoire.\"\n\nA central cloister with garden and fountain forms the heart of campus. The two basins of the ancient fountain are fed by the \"Acqua Felice\" aqueduct, one of the aqueducts of Rome, and the first new aqueduct of early modern Rome, completed in 1585 by Pope Sixtus V whose birth name was Felice Peretti. It also feeds the fountain by Giovanni Battista Soria (c. 1630) at the entrance to the \"Angelicum's\" walled garden, and the fountain under the stair below the University's \"portineria\" or porter's lodge before coursing across the Quirinal hill to its terminus at the Moses fountain or Fontana dell'Acqua Felice on the \"Via del Quirinale\".\n\nArched porticos designed by Vignola but completed after his death flank the cloister. Ten arches on the long sides and seven on the short are sustained by pilasters in the Tuscan style rising from high plinths. A simple frieze with smooth triglyphs and metopes separates lower from upper levels.\n\nEleven classrooms encircle the cloister, the last of which, the \"Aula della Sapienza\" (Hall of Wisdom) is the site of the University's doctoral defenses. Also located off the cloister are the administration offices and the \"Sala delle Colonne\", a reception room with antique marble columns and arched ceilings bearing traces of late Renaissance style frescos, which initially housed a library.\n\nOn the second level encircling the cloister are the living quarters of Dominican professors and the \"Sala del Senato\" (Academic Senate Room). The latter was the Chapter room of the convent and is appointed with a 14th-century triptych of Saint Andrew by Lippo Vanni, a 13th-century crucifix, and a full-body relic of an unidentified saint encased in Imperial Roman armor.\n\nTo the east of the \"Sala delle Colonne\" is the \"Aula Magna Giovanni Paolo II\", a raked semicircular auditorium with seating for 1100 people that was constructed during 1930s renovations by Roman engineer Vincenzo Passarelli (1904–1985). The \"Aula Magna\" was recently renamed after one of the \"Angelicum's\" most illustrious alumni, Pope John Paul II. The adjacent \"Aula Minor San Raimondo\" seats 350 people. Beyond these auditoria are the university's cafe, the \"Angelicum\" Bookshop, and the university's library.\n\nThe \"Palazzo dei Decanati\" (Deans' Building) is located at the West edge of campus just inside the main gates. The West boundary of the \"Angelicum\" is formed by the \"Salita del Grillo\".\n\nThe main part of the \"Angelicum\" library consists of that part of the textual patrimony of the \"Angelicum\" not expropriated by the Italian government with the Biblioteca Casanatense in 1870. At the convent of Saints Sixtus and Dominic the library originally housed 40,000 volumes in the \"Sala delle Colonne\". As the library grew space was found under the Aula Magna for a library whose large windows face out to the palm trees of the \"Angelicum\" walled garden. The collection that remains at the college today consists of approximately 400 000 volumes, about 6 000 manuscripts, 2 200 \"incunabula\" including 64 Greek codices, and 230 Hebrew texts including 5 Samaritan codices is open to the scholarly community.\n\nAmong the library's treasures is included the original copy of the doctoral thesis \"Doctrina de fide apud S. Ioannem a Cruce\" (The Doctrine of Faith in St. John of the Cross) written by the future Pope John Paul II, Karol Józef Wojtyła, under the direction of Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange and defended on 19 June 1948\n\nOn the south side of campus the walled garden is bordered by private properties. At the garden entrance stands a fountain by Giovanni Battista Soria built circa 1630. The garden is planted with trees of many kinds: orange, lemon, pistachio, olive, fig, palm and laurel, as well as with grape vines, and is an oasis of calm and silence, a figure of paradise in the midst of the bustling eternal city. In 1946 in this garden the young student Karol Wojtyla, future Pope John Paul II, would stroll and visit daily what he called the \"miraculous tree\", an ancient olive from which springs incredibly the branches of a palm, a fig, and a laurel.\n\nAlong the north side of campus are found the University's Church of Saints Dominic and Sixtus, the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, and the Choir. The church has been the subject of numerous works of art. In the 18th century Antonio Canaletto made a pen and ink study with grey wash and black chalk, today in the collection of the British Museum, described as depicting \"the Church of SS Domenico e Sisto, Rome; with a sweeping double staircase to the entrance, in the foreground a man bowing to two approaching ladies\". Italian born American painter John Singer Sargent during his extensive travels in Italy made an oil painting of the exterior staircase and balustrade of the campus's Church of Saints Dominic and Sixtus in 1906. Sargent described the ensemble as \"a magnificent curved staircase and balustrade, leading to a grand façade that would reduce a millionaire to a worm\". The painting now hangs at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University. Sargent used the architectural features from this painting later in a portrait of Charles William Eliot, President of Harvard University from 1869 to 1909. Sargent made several preliminary pencil sketches of the balustrade and staircase, which are in the collection of the Harvard University art collection of the Fogg Museum. The Church as also been depicted by Ettore Roesler Franz and Eero Saarinen. The Church and stair also feature in the 1950 film Prima comunione by director Alessandro Blasetti, which is on the list of the 100 Italian films to save.\n\nThe northern flank of campus borders \"via Panisperna\" across from the perimeter wall of the Roman Villa Aldobrandini, a 17th-century princely villa whose gardens were truncated by the construction of Via Nazionale in the 19th century, and which today houses the headquarters of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT). Behind the campus intersecting with Via Nazionale is the \"Via Mazzarino\", named after Michele Mazzarino professor of theology at the College after 1628 who was appointed Master of the Sacred Palace under Pope Urban VIII in 1642, and Archbishop of Aix-en-Provence in 1645 by Pope Innocent X. Mazzarino's brother Giulio Mazzarino, known as \"Jules Mazarin\" was chief minister under Louis XIV of France. The East edge of campus is bound by \"Salita del Grillo\" beyond which is the Markets and Forum of Trajan.\n\n\n\nOther recent lectures and events of note related to the University's mission include:\n\nThe \"Angelicum\" Alumni Achievement Award is conferred upon alumni who have distinguished themselves by serving the Church's mission in exceptional ways. The award is bestowed on 7 March, the old feast day of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Patron of the University. Past recipients include Cardinal John Foley (2009), Archbishop Peter Smith (2011), and Cardinal Edwin Frederick O'Brien (2012).\n\nThe Pope John Paul II Lecture on Interreligious Understanding is delivered towards the end of each academic year and features a world religious leader or renowned expert who embodies the ideals of inter-religious understanding. The lecture is a major event at the Angelicum and attracts the Roman academic community as well as the international diplomatic community. To date the Annual Lecture has hosted an array of prominent and Internationally known academics and religious leaders as key note speakers.\"\n\nIn 1908 when the College was transformed it into the \"Collegium Pontificium Internationale Angelicum\" Blessed Hyacinthe-Marie Cormier bestowed upon it his personal motto as Master General of the Order of Preachers, \"caritas veritatis\". This Latin phrase literally translated as \"the charity of truth\" appears in \"\"The City of God\"\" by St. Augustine of Hippo, and is quoted by St. Thomas Aquinas in comparing the active and the contemplative life: \"Unde Augustinus dicit XIX \"De civ. Dei\", Otium sanctum quaerit caritas veritatis; negotium justum, scilicet vitae activae, \"suscipit necessitas caritatis\",\" which Aldous Huxley translates in \"The Perennial Philosophy\" as: \"The love of Truth seeks holy leisure; the necessity of love undertakes righteous action.\" Augustine's phrase also appears in the writings of William of St-Thierry\n\nThe \"Angelicum\" does not currently have a school song.\n\nAcademic dress for \"Angelicum\" graduates consists of a black toga or academic gown with trim to follow the color of the faculty, and an academic ring. In addition, for the Doctorate degree a four corned biretta is to be worn, and for the Licentiate degree a three corned biretta is to be worn. Traditionally the ceremony at which the \"biretum\" is imposed is called the \"\"birretatio\"\".\n\nFor those holding doctoral degrees from a pontifical university or faculty \"the principal mark of a Doctor's dignity is the four horned biretta.\" The 1917 Code of Canon Law canon 1378 and 1922 commentary prescribe the four corned \"biretum doctorale\" and doctoral ring or \"annulum doctorale\" for doctorates in philosophy, theology, canon law, specifying that the \"biretum\" should decorated according to the color of the faculty (\"diverso colore ornatum pro Facultate\"). The 'traditional' \"Angelicum\" biretta is white to correspond to the white Dominican habit. However, the Academic Senate of the \"Angelicum\" in its May 2011 meeting indicated that for the Licentiate and Doctorate a black biretta may be used with colored piping and pom to follow the color of the faculty.\n\nThe biretta is lay in origin and was adopted by the Church in the 14th century: \"Many synods ordered the use of this cap [the \"pileus\" or skull cap] as a substitute for the hood, and in one instance the synod of Bergamo, 1311, ordered the clergy to wear the \"bireta\" on their heads after the manner of laymen'.\" Herbert Norris, \"Church Vestments: Their Origin and Development\", 1950, 161).\n\nThe Olympic motto \"Citius, Altius, Fortius\" (Faster, Higher, Stronger) was coined by Henri Didon for a Paris youth gathering in 1891, and later proposed as the official Olympic motto by his friend Pierre de Coubertin in 1894 and made official in 1924. Didon completed his theological studies at the College of Saint Thomas in 1862.\n\nThe Clericus Cup is a soccer tournament that takes place annually between the various pontifical universities of Rome. The teams are composed of seminarians, priests, and lay students studying in each of the pontifical universities. The league was started by Cardinal Secretary of State, Tarcisio Bertone who is an unapologetic football fan. The \"Angelicum\" first participated in 2011, and came in 2nd place in 2012. During the history of the Clericus Cup, players have come from 65 countries, with the majority coming from Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and the United States. The annual tournament is organized by the Centro Sportivo Italiano. Officially, the goal of the league is to \"reinvigorate the tradition of sport in the Christian community.\" In other words, to provide a venue for friendly athletic competition among the thousands of seminarians and lay students, representing nearly a hundred countries, who study in Rome.\n\nIn November 2011 Minerva the Owl was voted in as the \"Angelicum\" mascot.\n\nThe \"Angelicum\" does not provide housing primarily intended for lay students. However, assistance finding local student housing is offered by the \"Angelicum Office\" of Student Affairs (ASPUST). The office is located in the Palazzo dei Decanati or Deans' Building at the West end of campus, just inside the gates to the right.\n\nThe Lay Centre at Foyer Unitas is an international college for lay students within walking distance of the \"Angelicum\".\n\nThe Convitto San Tommaso was established by the Dominican Order in 1963 as a place of residence in Rome for secular priests who come to the Rome in order to pursue higher studies at one or other of the Roman Universities. There are approximately 55 student priests. They come from five continents of the world. Three Dominicans live in the house to serve the practical and spiritual needs of the house: the Rector, the Spiritual Director, and the Bursar. The life of the house focuses on daily celebration of the Eucharist.\n\nThe following is a sample of student activities:\n\nASPUST holds elections for its offers in mid November each year.ASPUST offers services to students and prospective students of the \"Angelicum\" such as information about health services and insurance, information about apartment hunting, other services relating to public transportation, computers, cafeterias, and a blog that reports on student activities.\n\n\nThe \"Angelicum\" Bookshop is run by \"Libreria Leoniana\" of Rome. Located on near the University Library, it specializes in ecclesiastical literature, Italian and foreign language literature, and provides stationery, photo-reproduction, computer, and bindery services. Hours during the academic year are 9:00am to 1:00pm and 3:00pm to 6:00pm. It is closed Saturdays and the month of August.\n\n\nThe following are some \"Angeliocum\" notables from the relatively recent past.\n\n\nFor a more complete list of notable \"Angelicum\" faculty throughout its history see List of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas\n\n\n\n"}

Ahmadu Seku's father, El Hadj Umar Tall, conquered Ségou (then the heart of the Bambara Empire) on March 10, 1861.

Ahmadu Seku continued to act as Faama of the eastern regions from Segou, suppressing the rebellions of several neighboring cities but quarrelling increasingly with his brothers. The French colonial army invaded the empire in the 1880s and 1890s, taking Ségou in 1892 and forcing Ahmadu Seku to flee to Sokoto in present-day Nigeria.\n\nEnglish references\n"}
{"id": "2174689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174689", "title": "Deal flow", "text": "Deal flow\n\nDeal flow is a term used by finance professionals such as venture capitalists, angel investors, private equity investors and investment bankers to refer to the rate at which they receive business proposals/investment offers. The term is also used not as a measure of rate, but simply to refer to the stream of offers or opportunities as a collective whole. An organization's deal flow is considered \"good\" if it results in enough revenue- or equity-generating opportunities to keep the organization functioning at peak capacity.\n\nThe most famous and successful venture capital firms regularly receive hundreds of business plans each month. From among these, it is not unusual for a VC firm to actually fund only 0.25%–0.5%. Active angel investment groups will typically receive dozens of plans monthly, but because of the much smaller number of plans compared to VCs they tend to fund a somewhat higher percentage (0.5%–1.0%). Once a company makes it through the group's screening process, however and is invited to present to the group's full membership, its chances of getting funded rise to about 18%, according to the University of New Hampshire's Center for Venture Research.\n\nA fund's or group's deal flow is generated from many sources. The most valuable referrals often come from entrepreneurs or companies in which the fund has previously invested; from other funds looking to syndicate a deal; and from professionals (such as attorneys and accountants) who are familiar with the fund's investment criteria. Other sources of deal flow are investment bankers and \"finders\", who expect to receive a fee (from either the company or the investor) for making the introduction.\n\nMany funds and groups (but not all) will also accept business plans \"over the transom\", that is, as an unreferred submission from a company with no previous relationship with the funding organization. In practice, however, such unreferred plans are usually much less likely to receive funding.\n\nIn order to create and maintain a sufficient deal flow, venture capitalists and angels spend much of their time doing business development, raising their profiles by giving speeches, writing blogs, and networking with others who also work with early-stage companies. VCs and angels also regularly attend conferences and \"venture fairs\" where multiple companies pitch their businesses to investors.\n\nDeal flow on the Internet is currently undergoing a fundamental transformation due to the JOBS Acts passage in the United States. Soon, equity based deals and funds will be able to be marketed to the public through equity crowdfunding. This is normally referred to as general solicitation. General solicitation of these equity deals will increase the deal flow on the Internet.\n\n\n"}

By popular vote, the group was inducted into The SoulMusic Hall Of Fame at SoulMusic.com in December 2012, and The Official R&B Music Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nThe Whispers formed in 1963 in Watts, California. The original members included identical twin brothers Wallace \"Scotty\" and Walter Scott, along with Gordy Harmon, Marcus Hutson, and Nicholas Caldwell. After being invited to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1966 by Sly Stone, the group relocated to that area where they began developing a reputation as a show-stopping live act. Walter Scott was drafted to serve in the Vietnam War during that period for eighteen months, returning to the group in 1969 after discharge. After Harmon injured his larynx in a driving accident in 1973, he was replaced by former Friends of Distinction member Leaveil Degree.\n\nThe group scored many hits on the R&B and \"Billboard\" Hot 100 charts throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and they hit #1 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart in 1979/80 with \"And the Beat Goes On / \"Can You Do the Boogie\" / \"Out the Box\". In 1987, they enjoyed a brief tenure in the Top 10 when \"Rock Steady\" became their first Top 10 success on the Hot 100, reaching #7, while also capturing the #1 spot on the R&B chart.\n\nAfter a series of singles on Los Angeles label, Dore, the group signed to a small LA label, Soul Clock, run by producer Ron Carson, who was responsible for their breakthrough hit, \"Seems Like I Got To Do Wrong\" in 1970. Moving to the larger New York-based Janus label, they continued to be produced by Carson, before he sold all of his recordings to Janus with the group then recording mainly in Philadelphia in the mid '70s. Since that period, most of their studio work has been done in Los Angeles. Their most successful period was in the 1980s with SOLAR Records (Sound Of Los Angeles Records), which was operated by their manager at the time, Dick Griffey. The Whispers later established their own production company, Satin Tie Productions, through which they released their independent 2006 album \"For Your Ears Only\".\n\nThe group opened Game 2 of the 1989 World Series at Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum with their rendition of the National Anthem.\n\nMarcus Hutson left the group in 1992 due to prostate cancer.

{"id": "2174744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174744", "title": "The Den", "text": "The Den\n\nThe Den (previously The New Den) is a football stadium in Bermondsey, south-east London, and the home of Millwall Football Club. It is adjacent to the South London railway originating at , and a quarter of a mile from the Old Den, which it replaced in 1993. Built on a previous site of housing, a church and the Senegal Fields playgrounds, it has an all-seated capacity of 20,146. The highest match attendance in the 2018-19 season was 17,195. The Den is the sixth stadia that Millwall has occupied since their formation in the Millwall area of the Isle of Dogs in 1885. Previous grounds include Glengall Road (1885–1886), Lord Nelson Ground (1886–1890), The Athletic Grounds (1890–1901), North Greenwich (1901–1910) and The Old Den (1910–1993).\n\nThe New Den, as it was initially known to distinguish it from its predecessor, was the first new all-seater stadium in England to be completed after the Taylor Report on the Hillsborough disaster of 1989. It was designed with effective crowd management in mind (particularly given Millwall's crowd problems at The Old Den), with the escape routes being short and direct. After chairman Reg Burr decided that it would not be viable to redevelop The Old Den as an all-seater stadium, he announced in 1990 that the club would relocate to a new stadium in the Senegal Fields area in south Bermondsey. Originally, it was planned to have a seating capacity of between 25,000 and 30,000, however, the club opted to wait so the capacity was kept to just over 20,000.\nMillwall played their final game at The Old Den on 8 May 1993 after 83 years and then moved to the new stadium a quarter-of-a-mile away from Cold Blow Lane. The £16 million New Den was opened by John Smith, the leader of the Labour Party and of the Opposition at the time, on 4 August 1993 prior to a prestigious friendly against Sporting Portugal, which Sporting won 2–1. The Den was the first new stadium constructed for a professional football team in London since 1937.\n\nMillwall have experienced mixed fortunes since relocating to The Den. Their first season at the stadium (1993–94) saw them finish third in Division One — their highest finish since relegation from the top flight four years earlier. However, their dreams of Premier League football were ended by a defeat in the playoffs and they were relegated to Division Two in 1996, not winning promotion from that level until 2001. They again came close to reaching the Premier League in 2002, finishing fourth, but once again losing in the playoffs. The Lions reached the FA Cup final for the first time in 2004, and despite a 3–0 defeat by Manchester United they qualified for European competition for the first time in their history. Millwall has been relegated twice since then; going down in 2006 and 2015, but have also won promotion in 2010 and 2017. However, the stadium has yet to host Premier League football - Millwall had played in the old First Division for two seasons from 1988 during their final few years at their previous stadium.\n\nIn September 2016 Lewisham Council approved a compulsory purchase order of land surrounding The Den rented by Millwall, as part of a major redevelopment of the \"New Bermondsey\" area. The plans are controversial because the developer, Renewal, is controlled by offshore companies with unclear ownership, and is seen by the club and local community to be profiteering by demolishing existing homes and businesses as well as Millwall's car-park and the highly acclaimed and well recognised Millwall Community Trust - to build up to 2,400 new private homes, with no council housing and less than 15% of 'affordable housing'. Millwall had submitted their own plans for regeneration centred around the football club itself, but the council voted in favour of Renewal's plans.\n\nIn December 2016 \"Private Eye\" reported how Renewal had been founded by a former Lewisham Council leader and senior officer, suggesting potential bias, and that the decision to approve Renewal's plans may have been made as long ago as 2013 despite the fact that no due diligence had been able to be carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers due to \"poor\" and \"limited\" access to information and management at Renewal, which is registered in the Isle of Man.\n\nIn October 2019 Lewisham Council terminated the conditional land sale agreement with Renewal. This allowed Millwall to prepare their own development plans, and in February 2020, Millwall announced plans for a phased expansion, adding upper tiers behind existing seating to gradually expand the Den to 34,000 seats.\n\nOn 20 January 2011 the east stand of The Den was renamed as the Dockers Stand, paying tribute to Millwall's earlier history and supporter-base of Thames dockers. The south stand is known as the Cold Blow Lane stand, which was the name of the road which led into The Old Den. The north stand is for visiting supporters and the west stand was renamed the Barry Kitchener Stand, named after Millwall's longest-serving player. It houses Millwall's family enclosure, press box and executive seats.\n\nIn 1994, a boxing match was held at The Den. Local boy Michael Bentt lost his WBO World Heavyweight Championship to Herbie Hide. The fight was Bentt's last after being rushed to the hospital and told he could never fight again, after suffering brain injuries in the loss. On 1 May 2006, The Den hosted the FA Women's Cup Final between Arsenal L.F.C. and Leeds United L.F.C.. Arsenal Ladies won the Cup 5–0. Three international matches have been hosted at The Den. Ghana 1–1 Senegal (21 August 2007), Jamaica 0–0 Nigeria (11 February 2009) and Australia 3–4 Ecuador (5 March 2014). Former Millwall player Tim Cahill scored two of Australia's goals, becoming the country's all-time top scorer. On September 5, 2015, the ground hosted Rugby league as Wigan Warriors defeated the Catalans Dragons 42-16 in a Super League Super 8s match in front of a crowd of 8,101.\n\nThe Den hosted the Samaritans Celebrity Soccer Sixes on 18 May 2008. Film and Television stars played at The Den, the first time the event has not been hosted by a Premier League Club. Babyshambles failed to retain the trophy, losing 3-2 to dance act Faithless. The winners of the women's trophy were Cansei de Ser Sexy. Around 150 celebrities took part including McFly, Tony Hadley, Amy Winehouse and ex-Millwall fan favourite Terry Hurlock to raise money for the charity.\n\nThe Den doubles as The Dragon's Lair, home ground of Harchester United in the TV series \"Dream Team\". It also appeared in an episode of the ITV show \"Primeval\". The Base is often used by the TV and film industries. It was used to film \"The Bill\" episode of \"Gun Runner: Kick Off\" featuring their home game against Leyton Orient in March 2008 (aired on ITV in June 2008). Sportswear giant Nike filmed their \"Take It To The Next Level\" advertistment over a period of three days and nights at The Den, also in March 2008. In 2010, Kit Kat made their own 'Cross your Fingers' advert using clips from Arsenal, West Ham, Oxford United and also Millwall's Den.\n\nThe Den is served by the National Rail station South Bermondsey, which is a five-minute walk away from the ground. Away supporters have their own walkway link, which is available to them on match days. There are no official car parking facilities for supporters. The P12 bus stops closest to the ground in Ilderton Road, just a two-minute walk away. The 21, 53 and 172 buses all stop on the Old Kent Road, a ten-minute walk away from the ground. The closest tube station to The Den is Canada Water (on the Jubilee line), which is a 20-minute walk away. The former East London Line stations of and (now part of London Overground) both are a 15-minute walk from the stadium. The New Bermondsey railway station, a London Overground line adjacent to the Den, is currently under construction, with 1/3 already being complete. Work will begin again by the end of 2015.\n\nThe Quietway 1 cycle route runs around South Bermondsey station and past the Den. However, the route is closed and diverted in the vicinity of the stadium on Millwall match days.\n\n"}

This painting is done with a variety of tools, including fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks and using natural dyes and pigments. It is characterised by its eye-catching geometrical patterns. There is ritual content for particular occasions, such as birth or marriage, and festivals, such as Holi, Surya Shasti, Kali Puja, Upanayana, and Durga Puja.\n\nMadhubani painting (Mithila painting) was traditionally created by the women of various communities in the Mithila region of the Indian subcontinent. It originated from Madhubani district of the Mithila region of Bihar. Madhubani is also a major export center of these paintings. This painting as a form of wall art was practiced widely throughout the region; the more recent development of painting on paper and canvas mainly originated among the villages around Madhubani, and it is these latter developments that led to the term \"Madhubani art\" being used alongside \"Mithila Painting.\"\n\nThe paintings were traditionally done on freshly plastered mud walls and floors of huts, but now they are also done on cloth, handmade paper and canvas. Madhubani paintings are made from the paste of powdered rice. Madhubani painting has remained confined to a compact geographical area and the skills have been passed on through centuries, the content and the style have largely remained the same. Thus, Madhubani painting has received GI (Geographical Indication) status. Madhubani paintings use two-dimensional imagery, and the colors used are derived from plants. Ochre, Lampblack and Red are used for reddish-brown and black, respectively.\n\nMadhubani paintings mostly depict people and their association with nature and scenes and deities from the ancient epics. Natural objects like the sun, the moon, and religious plants like tulsi are also widely painted, along with scenes from the royal court and social events like weddings. Generally, no space is left empty; the gaps are filled by paintings of flowers, animals, birds, and even geometric designs. Traditionally, painting was one of the skills that was passed down from generation to generation in the families of the Mithila Region, mainly by women. It is still practiced and kept alive in institutions spread across the Mithila region. Kalakriti in Darbhanga, Vaidehi in Madhubani, Benipatti in Madhubani district and Gram Vikas Parishad in Ranti are some of the major centres of Madhubani painting which have kept this ancient art form alive.\nMadhubani art has five distinctive styles: Bharni, Kachni, Tantrik, Godna and Kohbar. In the 1960s Bharni, Kachni and Tantrik styles were mainly done by Brahman and Kayashth women, who are 'upper caste' women in India and Nepal. Their themes were mainly religious and they depicted Gods and Goddesses, plants and animals in their paintings. People of lower castes included aspects of their daily life and symbols, the story of Raja Shailesh [guard of the village] and much more, in their paintings. Nowadays Madhubani art has become a globalised art form, so there is no difference in the work on the basis of the caste system. They work in all five styles. Madhubani art has received worldwide attention.<ref name=\"a-painter-from-patna-crafted-a-live-madhubani-painting-in-bangkok/\"></ref>\n\nThe Madhubani painting tradition played a key role in environmental conservation efforts in India in 2012, where there was frequent deforestation in the state of Bihar. Shashthi Nath Jha, who runs the Gram Vikas Parishad, an NGO, started the initiative as an attempt to protect local trees that were being cut down in the name of expanding roads and development. The main reason behind this was that the trees were traditionally adorned with forms of gods and other religious and spiritual images such as those of Radha-Krishna, Rama-Sita, scenes from Ramayana and Mahabharata and other mythologies. This recognition of the cultural and aesthetic significance of the trees largely prevented them from being cut.<ref name=\"Dhiraj Singh IDC IIT BOMBAY/\"></ref>\n\nMadhubani painting received official recognition in 1969 when Sita Devi received the State award by Government of Bihar. Jagdamba Devi was the first artist from Mithila to receive a National Award in Mithila paintings. In 1975, the President of India gave the Padma Shri award to Jagdamba Devi, and the National Award to Sita Devi of Jitwarpur village near Madhubani. Jagdamba Devi's foster son Satya Narayan Lal Karn and his wife Moti Karn are also well-regarded Mithila artists, and they won the National Award jointly in 2003. Sita Devi received the Padma Shri in 1981. Sita Devi was also awarded by Bihar Ratna in 1984 and Shilp Guru in 2006. In 1984 Ganga Devi was awarded by Padma Shri. Mahasundari Devi received the Padma Shri in 2011. Baua Devi, Yamuna Devi, Shanti Devi, Chano Devi, Bindeshwari Devi, Chandrakala Devi, Shashi kala Devi, Leela Devi, Godavari Dutta, and Bharti Dayal were also given the National award. Chandrabhushan (Rasidpur), Ambika Devi (Rasidpur), Manisha jha were also given the National award.\n\n\n\n"}

As a result, the group unanimously agreed to establish the new capital on the site of the Government Stock Farm located within the municipalities of Laur and Bongabon. The municipalities of Gapan, San Jose, Santa Rosa, Guimba, Talavera, General Tinio, Baloc (Santo Domingo), and Muñoz were also considered as potential sites for the new capital.\n\nIn 1955, President Ramon Magsaysay declared a portion of the Government Stock Farm open for settlement pursuant to presidential \"Proclamation No. 237\".\n\nOn June 19, 1965, the Congress of the Philippines enacted \"Republic Act 4475\" creating Palayan City as the new capital of Nueva Ecija. \"\"Palayan\"\" (rice paddy\")\" was chosen as the name of the new provincial capital to reflect the moniker bestowed upon the province of Nueva Ecija as the “\"Rice Granary of the Philippines\"”. The city government was constituted on December 5, 1965 with then Governor Eduardo L. Joson acting as the city's Ex-Officio Mayor while the Provincial Board constituted the first City Council. Under this administration, Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) purchased a large tract of land at the city's parameters near Laur to house INC members from Hacienda Luisita due to conflicts arising from union disbandments.\n\nIn 1969, Mayor Elpidio O.

The resettlement site was eventually converted into barangay Marcos Village.\n\nIn 1983, the training ground of the Philippine Army was transferred from Fort Bonifacio in Metro Manila to Fort Ramon Magsaysay. This paved the way for the development of the reservation area into a training complex to serve the army's training requirements.\n\nIn 1993, the Asianwide Green Scouts Movement was founded during the first RP-Japan Bilatateral Ecology Work Camp held in the city. The event also led to the establishment of the projects Kawayang Buhay and the Asian Ecology Forest which is supported by the Asian Friendship Society.\n\nOn 1995, Barangay Popolon, formerly a barangay of Bongabon, was annexed to the city by virtue of \"Republic Act No. 8030\" ratified by a plebiscite held on October 1, 1995.

It was in 1913, under Executive Order No. 72, when Muñoz was declared as a new and independent municipality. By the virtue of Republic Act 8977 signed on November 7, 2000, Muñoz formally elevated to a city and country's only city with \"Science\" in its formal name.\n\nIn 1886, Papaya was changed into 'Muñoz' to honor Don Francisco Muñoz, the province's alcalde mayor, and the community's first appointed gobernadorcillo. Muñoz was annexed as a barrio of San Juan de Guimba municipality. Settlers trickled in from Bulacan and the Ilocos Region. In 1911, Factoria (now San Isidro town), the provincial capital, was totally flooded.

They were prepared to construct a municipal hall and a school building for the emerging town.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Provincial Board of Nueva Ecija, then headed by Governor Isauro Gabaldon, and with approval of then Acting Governor General Newton Gilbert, the organized barrios and sitios were granted independence as a regular municipality on January 10, 1913 under the name of Muñoz. The seat of the fledgling municipal government was positioned in erstwhile Barrio Muñoz. The municipality of Muñoz was born and steadily grew to become an agricultural Science City in the making.\n\nA municipal hall, a church, and a small public market were erected in Lumang Bayan (now Poblacion North). A road linking the young Muñoz town with the national highway from Barangay Bacal, Talavera was constructed. In World War II, Muñoz was the last stronghold of the Japanese Imperial Army; the Allied liberation in Muñoz by the joint United States and Philippine Commonwealth forces offensive razed the town to the ground in a matter of days.\n\nIn 2000, after achieving cityhood status, universities and scientific research institutes sprung up.

{"id": "2174804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174804", "title": "Guimba, Nueva Ecija", "text": "Guimba, Nueva Ecija\n\n', officially the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt was incorporated by the King of Spain by virtue of a royal decree in 1897.\n\nGuimba came from the Ilocano term 'Gebba' which was the process of heating molded clay pots in a pit until they turn reddish and durable. Tree stumps were made into large pieces of charcoal. The live charcoals were placed underneath the clay pots. After a few hours these were hardened and ready to bring out from the pit and ready for use.\n\nThe story goes, once a Spanish visited the place where most of the residents are engaged in pottery making. The foreigner stopped and asked the earth-bakers this question in a nasalized manner, 'Que lugar este?'. The foreigner asked what this place was. The natives misunderstood the question and were asked what they were doing, so they answered “GEBBA” pointing to the ground. The Spaniard repeated the word as they left the place “GHEBHA” after years have gone by the name of the place was hispanized into Guimba when the Spaniard founded the town as Pueblo en la provincia de Nueva Ecija. This pottery-making tradition is prevalent even in other barangays outside the central area of the town. An example is Barangay Pasong Intsik, which was named after 'old jars containing Chinese remains' were once found beneath a bridge.\n\nThe early Ilocano settlers brought with them the wonder image of Apo San Juan so they called the place San Juan de Guimba. In the American period, a resolution on the town separated the term 'Guimba' from 'Apo San Juan', thus its present name. But Apo San Juan remains as its Patron Saint. The pottery traditions of the indigenous settlers were later disintegrated and lost due to population influx from the Ilocos region and other areas in the south.\n\nWhat is now the town of Guimba was once a vast ecological rainforest which was part of the Central Luzon Rainforest during precolonial time, before the arrival of the Spanish. The area is believed to be inhabited by no permanent communities, rather, it is inhabited by hunter-gatherer societies, mainly Ilonggots. The area was once part of the huge territory that the Empire of Tondo, with its capital in a much forested Manila. In the collapse of the Empire of Tondo after the subjugation of Brunei, the area was transitioned into a free zone once again, where hunter-gatherers abounded. The area is also believed to once have been visited by migrating Aetas, Cordillerans, Ilokanos, and Ilonggots.\n\nThe first Ilocano settlers, arriving in wooden carts and horsebacks, cleared the thick forests and planted the first rice seeds in February 20, 1865, according to an old and brownish record found by Guimba's former Parish priest, Rev. Agustin \"Gus\" Polong, MSC. They called the area 'San Juan de Guimba' in honor of the patron saint the settlers brought from Ilocos, San Juan, and combined it with the pot-making industry called 'gebba' which they used to do in the old land. Since then, rice became the primary agricultural crop in the area. Due to this, it became the province of Nueva Ecija's traditional top rice-producing area in the 20th century.\n\nMore settlers arrived mostly from the old towns of Bacarra, Paoay, and Candon of the Ilocos provinces. Among the families who came were the Galapons, Mateos, Cudals, Padres, Cayogs, Romanos, Silvestres, Capinpuyans, Batangans, Faigals, Ramoses, Sumawangs, and Catabonas. What would be the town of Guimba is a relatively organized community when the Spanish colonialists arrived and appointed Don Luis De Ocampo as the first Gobernadorcillo, and later, Don Pablo Ramos and Santiago Cudal.\n\nThe Spanish left and the Americans came and in 1912, the town's name was abbreviated to Guimba with Don Alfonso Faigal as the first Alcalde Mayor. St. John the Evangelist though remains to be its patron saint. The first municipal hall was also built during this year in what is now known as Faigal Street. The Plaza Municipal evolved and what will become the public market started its commerce.\n\nA foot bridge was constructed during the administration of the late Agustin Vigilia, Alcalde Mayor. This foot bridge was constructed across the Binituran River leading to the northern barrios like San Andres, Balbalino, Gueset, Baybayabas, Cinence, Nangabulan to barangay Talugtug from the Parairo Street.\n\nLater this wooden bridge was demolished and transferred it to the present site north of the Faigal St. This was known as Faigal Bridge going to the north, to the municipality of Talugtug. Other infrastructures were put up with the public market and cleared the space for the Municipal Plaza, now the midtown municipal park.\n\nIn 1941, during the Japanese regime the late Juan Villamar was appointed Municipal Mayor. During World War II, the Imperial Japanese military forces entered and occupied Guimba in 1942. At daybreak of January 26, to August 15, 1945, advance reconnaissance units of the American troops under the U.S. Army 6th Infantry Division and aided by the local Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 2nd, 22nd, 25th and 26th Infantry Division liberated Guimba and, within hours, established outposts nine miles farther to the east along the Licab River and La Paz. Combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth military forces liberated the town of Guimba in 1945 and ended World War II.\n\nIn 1963, Dr. Virgilio Calica was the Mayor and it was during his term that the old Municipal Hall was constructed, the present site of our new municipal hall constructed in year 2004. This building was demolished during the administration of Jose Bopet Dizon and the new Municipal Hall was constructed and occupied in 2006.\n\nIn 2006, Guimba became a First Class municipality. The municipality is now known not just for its agriculture significance but also for its festival, Ragragsak Ti-Guimba.\n\nGuimba is in the western part of Nueva Ecija Province. It is north-west of Manila. It is from Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija and from Tarlac City.\n\nGuimba covers a land area of 25,853.2330 hectares.\n\nGuimba is politically subdivided into 64 barangays.

An annual home coming ball is also held every December by the Guimba New Year Association while its national festival, Ragragsak Ti Guimba is held for the town's foundation anniversary.\n\nMost Guimbanians derive their income from agriculture. As such, the agriculture sector ranks first in terms of generating employment for the populace. At the end of year 2006, Guimba had a total labor force of 38,120\n\nGuimba economy revolves mainly on agriculture. However, there are also cottages, small and medium scale industries.

It is composed of various events that begins at February and ends at March, preparations normally start at January. The highlights include Opening Mass, Ms. Guimba, Basketball Competitions, Ms. Gay, Mr. Teen, Opening Band, and the Street Dance which is the most popular.\n\nThe town formerly was known for its potteries, which were introduced by its first settlers from the Ilocos region. However, the tradition vanished sometime before or after the Philippine Revolution.\n\nThe town also possessed a rice-pounding tradition during full moons, however, the tradition vanished during the Martial law period in the 1980s.\n\nIn accordance to Article V Section 4 of the National Heritage Act of 2009 Republic Act 10066, the Philippine Registry of Cultural Property (PRECUP), the repository of all information pertaining to cultural properties in the Philippines deemed significant to Filipino cultural heritage, was established and came to effect last 2009.\n\nAside from cultural agencies of the government, the law also mandates the Cultural Office of the LGU to establish a \"Local Important Cultural Properties List and Documents\" as declared by the Sanggunian. These are cultural properties which are significant to local culture and history of Guimba.\n\nAmong the ways to register a cultural property in the PRECUP are: (1) Local government units, through their cultural offices, shall likewise maintain an inventory of cultural property under its jurisdiction and shall furnish the Commission a copy of the same; and (2) Private collectors and owners shall register their cultural property to the National Museum. Registered cultural properties shall remain in the possession of their private owners.\n\nA building, monuments, or zone aged 50 and above is considered a 'heritage structure.' Archives, books, and works of art with high significance to local culture and history is considered a 'heritage object.'

Philippine deer, Luzon warty pig, bleeding heart doves, and Philippine eagles were present as locals or passerby species. In the American period, agriculture was increased and the forest cover began to deplete. By the end of the 21st century, all big aves and wild mammals went extinct, while the forest cover was calculated to be less than 5% of its original extent.\n\n\nMore than half of Guimba's energy is taken from hydro power plants, making it a sustainable town.\n\nIts communications is mainly handles by Digitel, while Globe, Touch Mobile, Sun Cellular, and Smart are the predominant cellphone services used.\n\nEducation in Guimba is taught by various educational institutions in the municipality which offer mostly Information Technology, Hotel and Restaurant Management, and Teacher Education.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nDuring the Spanish Era, the municipality was only a component \"barrio\" of Gapan. When San Isidro became a town and was separated from Gapan, the town and San Antonio became one of its component barrios. When San Antonio itself became a town, the area was still its component \"barrio\" called San Agustin. By 1865, Jaen was known by its old name \"Ibayong Ilog\", and because there were many people in the river port in what is now Barangay Langla, the town became a centre for trade.\n\nWhen the place improved and its population grew to no less than 5,000 people, it became a town through a petition filed by the inhabitants through the initiative of two early leaders, \"Kabesang\" Prudencio Esquivel and \"Kapitan\" Antonio Embuscado. On June 18, 1865, Jaen itself partitioned from San Antonio, and retained Saint Augustine of Hippo as its patron saint. The Spanish officials signed the papers granting the petition that \"Ibayong Ilog\" be a town in Factoria (now San Isidro) which was then the capital of Nueva Ecija. The declaration was brought to Governor-General Juan de Lara e Irigoyen in Manila, and afterwards was submitted to the Vice-General of the Philippines in the person of Rev Gregorio Martínez. Father Martínez marked the document as approved but later wrote in his own wish that the name \"Ibayong Ilog\" be changed to the name of his birthplace of Jaén, Spain.\n\nIn coordination with Rev Estanislao B. Moso, \"Kabesang\" Prudencio and \"Kapitan\" Antonio led the establishment of the first Catholic church (the present-day parish church). Jaen is in Central Luzon, in the southern part of Nueva Ecija. About 100 km from Manila via the old Cagayan Valley Road, the town has other road networks connecting it to Nueva Viscaya, Isabela, Pampanga, Olangapo and Bataan. In the olden days, Pampanga River was once the only and the fastest way of transportation in going to Manila and other places.\n\nOn August 24, 1896, its people revolted against the Spaniards and in September of the same year, armed with \"bolo\"s and spears, ambushed and killed forty Spanish soldiers in Lumanas (now a \"Sitio\" of Barangay Santo Tomas South). This successful attack made Lumanas a historical site called \"\"Pinagtambangan\"\", where a marker was erected in memory of the event.\n\nThe municipality is situated in the southern part of Nueva Ecija, some north of Manila. Jaén is bounded by the municipalities of Santa Rosa on the north-east; Zaragoza on the north-west; by San Isidro on the south; San Leonardo on the east and by San Antonio on the west.\n\nThe municipality has a land area of and is divided into 27 barangays, two of which are in the \"Población\" proper.\n\nJaén is politically subdivided into 27 barangays.\nSitio's:\n\nElected Officials (2010-2013)\n\nCalabasa, Barangay Chairman: Felimon A.

{"id": "2174812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174812", "title": "Licab, Nueva Ecija", "text": "Licab, Nueva Ecija\n\n', officially the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nAbout north from Metro Manila, Licab lies in the lowest portion of the province, experiencing two situations: during rainy seasons, being located at the northern portion of the municipality are flood free barangays while the other five (5) barangays are mostly flooded.\n\nLicab was formerly a part of another town, Aliaga. In 1835, immigrants Don Dalmacio Esguerra and brother Tomas, toiled to scrape off thick leaves using only hoes and twigs of hard trees. The Esguerra Brothers first called the place “Pulong—Samat”. Later, after years of successful tilling and with families growing bigger they renamed the place \"Licab\", an Ilocano word meaning to \"scrape off\". Don Dalmacio had three other brothers who assisted him in his endeavour: Pedro, Abdun and Olegario. Olegario Esguerra married a woman named Betis, and one of their children is named Juliana who, in the early 1890s, married another local Gregorio Espiritu.\n\nThe new settlement attracted more settlers. Don Dalmacio’s commitment to improve Licab inspired him to work for its political identity. He filed a petition to the national government to make Licab a formal town. At first, the friar governor of Aliaga opposed the petition but later relented and Licab was proclaimed an independent municipality on March 28, 1894.\n\nFrom the town archives of San Nicolas Ilocos Norte, Ilocano families of Barangan, Bumanlag, Dawang and Casino all relatives immigrated to Licab a former barrio of Aliaga, Nueva Ecija in the early 1900s. Some relatives went as far as Guimba, Santo Domingo, Munoz, San Jose City and some had gone as far as San Mateo Nueva Viscaya to reside and raised their own families. The group led by Igmidio Barangan and his son Santiago Barangan and grandsons Dr.Victor A. Barangan and Dr. Roman A Barangan who became the town's earliest professionals in the fields of Medicine and Dentistry respectively, served in the town's Health Care System privately supplanting the early Albularios. A number of close relatives along with five sisters populated the town. The sisters were married to the families of Dumaya, Fernando, Juan, Bumanlag and Sawit and close relatives that were descendants of Tabios, Mariano, Agustin, Manuel and Corpuz among others. All of them remained residents of Licab and raised generations of families that now composed the majority of the populations.\n\nFollowing the establishment of Taft Commission in June 11, 1901 after the end of Philippine - American War, Gov General Wesley Merrit introduced Homesteading to clear the land and populate the province. Like the American old west the colonial government offering Homesteading to the new settlers is something new and this resulted in the mass exodus of Ilocano farmers. These families including the new settlers at nearby towns were generations of farmers and farmhands that sought freedom to own lands in the vast agricultural plains of Central Luzon.\n\nA well known national figure, Epifanio Delos Santos was elected the first Governor of Nueva Ecija in 1902 and 1904 under the American regime. Don Panyong as he was known to the town's folks was a well knowned Historian, Fiscal and a Writer, that made a name for himself in the national political arena. Hi-way 54 which was known to the Americans was named Epifanio delos Santos Avenue (EDSA) in his honor in 1959 by virtue of Republic Act 2140. A member of his family who left the town after the end of World War 2 went to reside in Malabon and donated a family lot that now became the town's Public Market at Poblacion Sur.\n\nSome well known old places may no longer be known today to young generations but as far as the history of Licab is concerned, these were part of development of the town. As a manifestation of these family's ownership, a place in a low-lying areas of the town called \"kababaan\" was named Sitio Barangan which is now part of Barangay Aquino along with Sitio Parsons, Suva and Ablang. In the early 19th century the head of the clan Igmidio a widower, lost his life for the love of a barrio lass of \"Bangbangkag\" now called Barangay San Cristobal. His son Santiago did not permit his marriage and therefore in a tree with a piece of rope ended his life in a tragedy. The place is now called \"Pinagbitinan\" at nearby local Church of Rizal.\n\nIn a year, the town proper were many times under water that includes some rice fields mostly destroyed. Some streets were inundated by stagnant water with makeshift pedestrian pathways adorned the streets, constructed made of bamboo to ease the movements of the town's folks on unpassable streets. Somehow the floods dried up during dry season and made the flooded streets passable again. The floods made the life of Licabenos very hard as palay dismal harvest made the farmers poorer. The local economy barely grew since its foundation and some families emigrated to the cities to seek better life. Prominent landmark such as \"Karaanan\" a low level lake between Villarosa and San Cristobal usually supplied plentiful organic delicacies to townsfolks such as Dalag, Hito, Gurami and edible Frogs during floods that usually graced our table. After so many years of floodings, silts and soils carried by the floods were deposited on the surface of the lake. The former lake vanished and dried up with its soil level rose, that now become precious additional rice fields.\nMany changes and developments of the town were attributed to the past administrations who contributed road repairs, rehabilitation and constructions to include flood protection with drainage/ canal systems. The present town's executive Mayor Wilfredo Sawit Domingo contributed additional construction and rehabilitated more roads and finally the makeshift bamboo pedestrian lanes on flooded streets are the things of the past. In the outer Barangays farm-to-market roads were constructed in coordination with barangay officers that made farm produce available in the local Market. Accordingly, local merchants made a way to sell their produce to other towns.\n\nOne of the greatest wisdom of the Mayor was to enter into Sister-Town Agreement between Licab and San Nicolas which was signed on Dec 27, 2013. In the nightlights of the Damili Festival of San Nicolas a historical event of the two sister towns culminated between Mayor Willy and Mayor Melanie Grace Valdez signing the Historical Agreement, which eventually cemented the earlier immigration of Ilocanos from San Nicolas to Licab. During the height of Licab Town Fiesta usually in the last week of the month of March, Mayor Willy introduced the Kariton Festival which was ingeniously celebrated, with each Barangay Captain contributing floats decorated with farm produce skillfully designed to show progress of the town. A large number of Karitons paraded the town and the best ones were to receive Prizes from the festival judges. The show attracted local tourists and former residents from Manila and around the provinces including members of national political parties.\n\nLicab is politically subdivided into 11 barangays.\n\nAgriculture has remained the prime industry of the municipality. Agricultural lands devoted to various agricultural activities cover about tens of thousands hectares out of the total provincial area of 550,718 hectares. Rice is still the prime crop of agricultural development and programs. Palay production in the town is boosted by a large network of irrigation facilities and other appurtenant structure.\n\nLive stock production of piggery and poultry were the second agricultural income source in this municipality.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town is derived from the Ilocano word \"lupa\", the name of an itchy plant found in great abundance within the town and its outskirts at the time of the town’s foundation in 1913.\n\nDuring the Spanish rule, the territorial jurisdiction of the province of Nueva Ecija extended to as far south at Cabiao and the towns of San Quintin, Rosales, Balungao and (H)umingan in the north, which later on formed part of the province of Pangasinan. Lupao was a component barrio of Umingan. It remained so until 1871 when some residents led by a Señor Calderon petitioned the Governor General for the segregation of Lupao as a barrio of Umingan and the eventual creation of Lupao as “Tenencia Absoluta” to be headed by a Teniente Absoluto. On September 28, 1871, the Govierno Superior Civil de Filipinas decreed the creation of Lupao as Tenencia Absoluta. It signified the formal segregation as barrio and the eventual creation as “pueblo” of the province of Nueva Ecija. Under the Spanish rule, a pueblo is created through the Laws of the Indies and represented a local government unit. The pueblo was an agency of the Central Government.\n\nSalvacion was the first barrio of Lupao. Its initial territory also included Barrio Cabaritan now known as San Jose City. Barangay San Roque was known as Odiao and San Isidro as Macaniaoed. Among the first leaders of the municipality during the twilight years of Spanish Rule were Benito Romualdo as “Capitan Municipal” and Celestino Jabalde as ‘Juez de Paz”.\n\nIn 1898, soon after the Treaty of Paris (1898) was signed and the payment of 20 million pesetas for the possession of the Philippines, the United States Military Government (USMG) issued General Order No. 43 proclaiming the establishment of municipal governments. The Second Philippine Commission (the Taft Commission) acting as the upper house of a bicameral legislature then issued Act No.82 in 1901, “The 1901 municipal code” provided for popularly elected presidents (mayor), vice presidents (vice mayor), and councilors to serve on municipal boards.\n\nIt was only in 1913 that Lupao became a town mainly through the concerted efforts of Gen. Manuel Tinio and Assemblyman Isauro Gabaldon of the Philippine Assembly (lower house). Its founding fathers were Victoriano Joanino, Calixto Laureta, Felix Carpio, Juan Briones, Anacleto Ganareal, Luis Mamaligsa, Gregorio Babagay, Sicto Baclig, Remigio Blas Caoile and Candido Mata.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Japanese Imperial forces was occupied and entering the invaded the towns of Lupao in 1942.\n\nIn 1945, the combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth military ground troops was liberated and re-invasion the towns at Lupao and defeats Japanese Imperial forces started the Battle of Lupao and ended World War II. The established of the main headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and United States Army was active on 1945 to 1946 and stationed in Lupao, Nueva Ecija after the Battle of Lupao on 1945 between the Japanese and the combined Filipino-American troops.\n\nDuring a military operation against the New People's Army on February 10, 1987, seventeen civilians, including an elderly couple and six children, were murdered by the Alpha Company, 14th Infantry (Avengers) Battalion, of the Philippine Army. The murders were carried out by the 14th Infantry after they failed to capture the NPA who had killed the Second Lieutenant Edgar Dizon, the platoon leader of the government troops in a sneak attack the night before. In an act of frustration and anger, the 14th Infantry gathered up unarmed civilians hiding in the rice paddies and murdered them with gunfire and bayonets, leaving 17 dead and 8 wounded, claiming that the dead were members of NPA. All 24 soldiers of the 14th Infantry Battalion were eventually tried before military court but were all acquitted, despite first-hand testimonies of the survivors. This great act of deception and cover-up by the military became known as the infamous \"Lupao Massacre.\" \n\nOn September 25, 2005, three NPA members were killed by soldiers of 71st Infantry Battalion during a hot pursuit operation against seven fully armed NPA in Barangay Cordero, Lupao.\n\nLupao is subdivided into 24 barangays.\n\nLupao belongs to the first type of climate in the Philippines. This type of climate has two (2) pronounced seasons: dry from the month of November to April and Wet during the rest of the year. This type of climate is typically hot, humid and tropical and is generally affected by the neighboring topography and the prevalent wind direction that varies within the year.\n\nResidents in Lupao are called \"Lupaoenian\". Ilocano is widely spoken especially in the barrios. Population is predominantly Ilocano in origin, According to the 2007 census, Lupao had a population of 36,832 people, 80% Ilocano and 20% Tagalogs, Kapampangans and Pangasinans. The world war babies, veterans, baby boomers, teachers and farmers composed the majority of the population. Just like any other local municipality, the younger population would leave home to find work in major cities and abroad.\n\nDue to its history and cultural background, Lupaoenian cuisine is greatly influenced by the Ilocanos and Pangasinenses. Rice is a staple food. Bangus, bagoong and alamang from Dagupan. Tinapa or smoked fish is also a famous dish which was commonly made locally in Ubbog. Locals also love their vegetables such as diningdeng- a concoction of vegetables & fish sauce; and boiled kamote tops.\nGoat \"kalding\" is a common treat for all occasions. It is a common ingredient on dishes such as pinapaitan, kilawin & adobo.\n\nThe locals are also fond of sweets like tinudok, espasol, puto, tambutambong, tupig, kalamay, ginataang bayabas and ingkiwar. Exotic food such as \"Tapang usa\" or venison, \"Baboy-ramo\" or wild hog meat, Abu-os \"ant egg\" were predominantly catered from Namulandayan brought to city center until the late 1980s, which eventually led to the probable extinction of local deers and hogs in the mountainside.\n\n\n"}

In 1880, having found the soil productive for agricultural purposes, the early settlers cleared the place, cultivate the land and cut down the trees. The trees were sawed into lumber out of which their houses were constructed. At time passes and population continues to grow, more and more demands are made for land and its resources. So much so, on the end of the 19th century, the barrio Nampicuan became a municipality and the first “alcalde mayors” were Andres Tabilangan and Feliciano Cuaresma. Before its formal creation and declaration as a municipality, Nampicuan was then a part and under the political jurisdiction of the town of Cuyapo.\n\nIn 1903, while the Philippines was still under the American Occupation, Nampicuan was reverted to the status of a barrio of the Cuyapo town.

Mabilog below Mt. Dalimanok which are found between Sierra Madre and Caraballo Mountain ranges. It is home to the Pantabangan–Carranglan Watershed Forest Reserve.\n\nThe place was discovered on November 30, 1645, by Fr. Juan Alonzo de Abarca, an Augustinian priest who with the 29th Spanish mission in the Philippines.\n\nThe village grew into a settlement and was officially included in the map of the Philippines in 1747. In 1900, Pantabangan formally became a town.\n\nIn early 16th to 17th centuries, the “Id-dules” (Aetas or Baluga) and Egongots (Ilongots) tribe inhabited the southern Sierra Madre and Caraballo Mountains. Based on Mr. Elito V. Circa, a folk visual artist and a writer who wrote most of the Pantabangan-Egongot arts and culture and interviewed some of the Egongot chieftains from Aurora province. He discovered that Pantabangan (Pantabanganan in early 18th century) came from the root Ilongot word \"Sabangan or Sabanganan\" that means \"junction of water streams\". It was learned that most of the places in Central Luzon were derived from Ilongot word like Caanaoan, Puncan, Cadanglaan (now Carranglan), Kabaritan (Now San Jose City) and others. Bungamong (Bongabon) and Cadanglaan was formerly sitio of Pantabangan and Kabaritan also part of Pantabangan.\n\nWhen the Second World War broke out, Japanese Imperial forces occupied the town municipality of Pantabangan in 1942 under the Japanese Occupation.

The groundbreaking ceremony led by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos took place on June 11, 1971. The project was finally completed in August 1974.\n\nThe construction of the Dam had great economic and social impact on the lives of Pantabangeños. About of productive farmland and the town center (East and West Poblacion) along with seven outlying barangays (Villarica, Liberty, Cadaclan, San Juan, Napon-Napon, Marikit and Conversion) were submerged under the new lake. Residents were relocated to higher ground overlooking the vast reservoir, which became the new Pantabangan town center. Before the expansion of the dam through the Casecnan Project in the 1990s, the belfry of the 18th century church resurfaced from the dam's summer low water level. During drought in 1983, some areas of the old town emerged.\n\nThe Pantabangan Dam is claimed to be the second largest dam in Asia, and supplies the irrigation requirements for about of agricultural lands in Central Luzon. Its power station generates 112 megawatts of hydroelectric power.\n\nIn February 1996, then President Fidel V. Ramos led the ground-breaking ceremony of the Casecnan Transbasin Project, a tunnel from the Casecnan River in Nueva Viscaya to a terminal point at the Pantabangan reservoir and was commissioned on December 11, 2001.

The succeeding years since its relocation saw its progress from a fifth-class municipality in 1975, then to a fourth-class, then to a second class Municipality in 2006 and finally, in July 2008, pursuant to Section 2 of the Department of Finance Order No. 23-08, Pantabangan was reclassified as First-Class Municipality.

The painter always depicting the life of Pantabangan from the 70s (time where the town of Pantabangan was submerged by the water) to the present with the style of creating image of Minggan on every painting that he made.

The main group consisted entirely of the pioneer-settlers who were Ilocanos, while others, who arrived later, were of different tribes with different dialects. They merged and formed a new neighborhood, originally called Bunobon after the \"bunobon\" seedlings that thrived in the soil. It became a sitio of Cabucbucan under the jurisdiction of Bongabon municipality.\n\nIn 1904, sitio Bunobon became a barrio called Nazareth. Because of the steady arrival of new settlers, a council of elders was formed. Selected as head was Apo Juliano Paraiso, one of the eldest within the group, who headed the request to the government to convert Nazareth into an independent town. Through the help of Governor Manuel Tinio and Assemblyman Isauro Gabaldon, the request of the elders was approved in 1908.\n\nOn December 26, 1912 Vice Governor Newton signed the act and simultaneously issued a proclamation creating the town of RIZAL. The town was named after Doc. Jose Rizal. On January 1, 1913, Don Julian Paraiso took his oath as the first Alcalde of the Municipality.

It is a statutory corporation whose members are appointed by the Minister for Health. It is regulated by the Health Insurance Authority.\n\nVhi Healthcare offers a number of health insurance products. It also has Dental and Travel insurance. Vhi Healthcare has over 1million members. Until 14 December 2006, its main rival in the market was BUPA Ireland but since BUPA's withdrawal, Irish based Laya Healthcare (formerly Quinn Healthcare) and Aviva have emerged as Vhi's main competition. The current Healthcare business model is based on directly paying the consultant and hospital bills of its members. In February 2010 Vhi launched Vhi HomeCare a joint venture providing \"Hospital in the Home\" type services, it also provides minor injuries treatment centres through another partnership, Vhi Swiftcare.\n\nThe Voluntary Health Insurance Board was created in 1957 under the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957 by the Minister for Health Tom O'Higgins. This law has been amended but remains the primary legislation under which Vhi Healthcare operates.\n\nThe company held a monopoly in the health insurance market in Ireland until 1996, when BUPA entered the market. The company re-branded from \"VHI – Voluntary Health Insurance\" to \"Vhi Healthcare\" in the early 2000s (decade), although the Board's legal name has never been altered.\n\nIt is expected that the \"statutory corporation\" status of Vhi Healthcare will soon be changed to prepare it for more vigorous competition as it is often accused of being a virtual monopoly on private healthcare. While the privatisation of the company is not believed to be imminent, it was reported in the company's 2004 Annual Report that the Minister for Health would change the status of the board into a limited company owned by the state. The Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2008, allows the Board to transfer its health insurance functions to a wholly owned subsidiary which will be a private company limited by shares. However, it does not dissolve the Board itself, which will become a holding company. It also requires the health insurance company to achieve the level of reserves that any other authorised insurer is required to have, something it was previously exempt from.\n\nThe Irish Government announced on 27 May 2010 that the company was to be privatised within the next three years. Spokespeople from the Department of Health stated that they did not expect premiums to increase or the loss of any jobs at the 800 strong company. The state expected to invest large sums of money to allow the company gain a solvency ratio in line with regulations and other insurance companies. This coincided with new health risk equalisation measures which were to be rolled out from 2012. The Irish government were looking toward retaining Ireland's history of community rating in health insurance.\n\nThis decision was, ostensibly, overturned by the coalition government formed after the 2011 Irish General Election. In their Programme for Government, the Coalition committed itself to retaining VHI Healthcare as a state-owned corporation, serving as a public option within a universal health insurance system and modelled on the Dutch healthcare system.\n\n\n"}

In the History of the Philippines (1521–1898), the Gobernadorcillo was the Chief Executive who holds office in the Presidencia. In 1895, the Spaniards changed the position of Gobernadorcillo to Capitan Municipal. (Local Government in the Philippines, Jose P. Laurel) During the American rule (1898–1946) (History of the Philippines (1898–1946)), the elected Mayor and local officials, including the appointed ones, held office at the Municipal Town Hall.\n\nUnder the Local Government Code of 1991 or Republic Act No. 7160, the Mayor acts as the Local Chief Executive and the different departments (Budget, Engineering, Treasury, Accounting, etc.) are under the supervision of the Mayor. The Vice Mayor, on the other hand, is the Presiding Officer of the Sangguniang Bayan/Sangguniang Panlungsod which enacts ordinances or issues Resolutions. The LGC of 1991, primarily authored by former Senator Aquilino \"Nene\" Pimentel Jr. , gave local autonomy to local government units (LGUs) at the provincial, city/municipal and barangay level. The LGUs were provided with Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) that gave them a substantial amount of public funds aside from the locally-generated funds (real property tax, fees, charges). Functions/services formerly provided by national government agencies such as the Dept. of Agriculture, Dept. of Health, Dept. of Social Welfare and Development were devolved to the provincial and city/municipal LGUs.\n\nThe incumbent Mayor of Santa Rosa is Josefino M. Angeles while the current Vice Mayor is Marie C. Evangelista (2019 - 2022). The incumbent Municipal Councilors are Romeo Angeles, Irene Bernardo, Dennis Dimacali, Roberto Jacinto, Armando Manuel, Marjorie Matias, Julian Mendoza and Glenn Santos. ABC President Rommel Marcelo and SK Fed.

These two awards are given by the Department of Interior and Local Government to local government units which practice good governance, transparency and accountability.\n\nThe previous Mayors of Santa Rosa were the following: Eulalio Saulo, 1909–1911; Dionisio Punsal, 1911–1913; Rafael Andres, 1917–1919; Apolinario Manubay, 1919–1921; Amado del Barrio, 1923–1928; Matias Beley, 1929–1931; Casimiro Marcelo, 1932–1939; Lazaro Cajucom, 1941–1944; Jacinto Martin, 1945–1947; Bonifacio Santos, 1948–1951; Severino Angeles, 1952–1959 / 1964–1971; Pedro Manubay, 1960–1963; Cesar Angeles, 1972–1985; Eduardo Enrile, 1985–1986; Juanito Bernardo, 1988–1998; Edgar Matias, July 1998 – December 1998; Geronimo Baldazo, December 1998 – 2001; Marlon Marcelo, 2001–2007; Josefino Manucot Angeles, 2007–2016; Marita Chua Angeles 2016 - 2019.\n\nThe following served as Vice Mayors of Santa Rosa: Benito Germino, 1952-59 / 1964-71; Marciano Marcelo, 1969-79; Eduardo Ennrile, 1972-1985; Rufino Galman, 1985-1988; Sesinando Santos, 1988-1992; Edgar Matias, 1992-1998; Gerry Baldazo, 1998; Julian \"Jojo\" Mendoza, 1998-2001; Josefino \"Otep\" Angeles, 2001-2007; Irene Bernardo, 2007-2013; Antonio Romero, 2013-2016; Eliseo Angeles, 2016 - 2019.\n\nSanta Rosa primarily depends on rice cultivation, vegetable production, commercial fishery, and tricycle sidecar fabrication. Just recently, the town started realizing its development potential.\n\nThe town's strategic location at the crossroads of two national highways: the Maharlika Highway and the Tarlac-Santa Rosa-Fort Magsaysay Road is accelerating its commercial and industrial development. It is also inevitably set to benefit from the spillover of Cabanatuan's built-up area.\n\nAs a result, Santa Rosa is gradually replacing agriculture with services and agro-industry as the main engines for growth. The stretch of Maharlika Highway is a growing commercial strip of local entrepreneurs competing with national businesses while the eastern part of the town is attracting investments in large commercial farms.\n\nAs of 2017,based on Commission on Audit of the Philippines,Santa Rosa economic status reached their Income of P190,671,476.98;Assets of P470,150,569.41;Liabilities of P181,022,725.17 and Allotments of 294,983,551.31.\n\nConcurrent to Santa Rosa's rapid growth is the buildup of perennially heavy traffic at the approach to the intersection of the national roads. To address the worsening situation, the local government teamed up with the Cabanatuan city government to construct a road that will bypass the town proper. As for Santa Rosa, only further growth is anticipated when Central Luzon Link Expressway and North Luzon East Expressway finally materialize.\n\nSanta Rosa's main landmark includes Santa Rosa Supermarket or \"Pamilihang Bayan ng Santa Rosa\", Santa Rosa Town Hall, Santa Rosa Town Park, Santa Rosa Central School, and St. Rose of Lima Parish Church. Other attractions which are most visited by tourists are The famous and old, round-shaped, miraculous chapel of San Mariano known as \"The Miraculous Round Chapel of San Mariano\", 18th Century Ancestral Houses in Santa Rosa, a private \"Gazebo\" of Cruz Compound in San Mariano, American Air Base and rivers, Mga Munting Bahay-kubo, and scenic rice fields.\n\nThe 1879 St. Rose Of Lima Parish Church belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cabanatuan (Dioecesis of Cabanatuanensi, Suffragan of Lingayen-Dagupan, comprising 16 towns of Southern Nueva Ecija, Cabanatuan City, Palayan City and Gapan City; Titular: St. Nicholas of Tolentine, September 10; Most Reverend Sofronio A. Bancud, SSS, DD).\n\nThe Church is located at Maharlika Hway, Poblacion, Santa Rosa, 3101 Nueva Ecija. It is part of the Vicariate of St. Rose of Lima (Titular: St. Rose of Lima, Feast, Aug 23). Its current Parish Priest is Rev. Fr. Edwin C. Dizon.\n\nSt. Rose of Lima, T.O.S.D., (April 20, 1586 – August 24, 1617) was the first person born in the Americas to be canonized by the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Holy Cross College (Former Holy Cross Academy) was founded by Rt. Rev. Msgr. Fernando C. Lansangan, Parish priest of the town of Santa Rosa in 1985 as secondary school with two first year classes. In 1948, government recognition was granted to the school for its high school department. In 1981, the expansion of the school's curricular program was conceived. During SY 1982–1983, the MECS granted permit for the first and second year curriculum of the degree Bachelor of Arts and the first and second year curriculum for the Junior Secretarial Course were offered to the public In its 39th year of service to the community.\n\nDr. Raquel Tioseco Santa Ines, niece of the founder Priest took over the management of the college after his death. In all its 66 years of existence, HCC continues with additional TESDA programs in Restaurant Management, Computer Secretarial, and Electronic and Computer Technology; and six-month courses in Contact Call Center and Medical Transcription. HCC offers Masters in Education major in Mathematics and English.\n\nSan Mariano Chapel is a round-shaped chapel that is located in the core of Barangay San Mariano Santa Rosa, Nueva Ecija. This serves as a landmark of the said Barangay. It was named before a patron, \"San Mariano\". The land where it is located was privately owned by a devoted family. After total and complete renovation of the said chapel, The land title was donated to St. Rose of Lima Parish Church.\n\nThe Old Miraculous San Mariano Chapel was then reconstructed with the help of a devotee named Antonio M. Romero year 2000 after he recovered from a paralysis year 1989. The said devotee religiously attended the mass held at San Mariano Chapel then miraculously recovered from such an illness as stated, he later on served as the Vice Mayor of the town and lost in his re-election due to corruption .\nPeople of San Mariano early 1900's used to kneel when passing at the old church including their carabaos or \"kalabaw\" before farming at dawn as a sign of respect in the said chapel.\n\nThe chapel was believed to be miraculous and famous since as it was known to be visited by thousand devotees of \"\"The Blessed Virgin Mary\"\" and \"\"Santo Niño\"\" during 1960s or 1970's. Miracles were actually witnessed by the people who visited the chapel and attended the mass held by the parish priest that time. Evidences of such miracles were collected and kept by group of families and people.\n\nFeast of \"Santo Niño\" were celebrated in San Mariano Chapel every 25 February where in a mass was held and simple gift giving and feeding for the children were organized by certain groups.\n\nSanta Rosa, Nueva Ecija is served by both public and DepEd-accredited private/catholic schools. \n\n\n"}

The recipient is made to put their back against a wall or pole and place their feet eighteen inches or so from the base of the object. The feet are usually kept close together. The subject must then slide down the wall or pole until their thighs are parallel to the ground, so that their profile is of someone sitting in a chair. They may also be required to slide their feet back until their shins and thighs are at right-angles to each other, which makes the stresses upon the knee joints and thigh muscles much greater.\n\nVariations include placing weight on the subject's head or thighs, or making them hold their arms straight out in front of them, perhaps with a weight clasped in their hands. The result is increasing amounts of pain in the thigh muscles, as well as pain in the knees and ankles. The benefit for the perpetrator is that this kind of punishment causes pain without any lasting marks or, under all but the most extreme conditions, lasting damage to the subjects.\n\nIn India this method of punishment is often referred to as the chair and was or is used in correcting juvenile delinquents. Also in other countries it was a commonly used punishment.\n"}
{"id": "2174846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174846", "title": "Compensatory lengthening", "text": "Compensatory lengthening\n\nCompensatory lengthening in phonology and historical linguistics is the lengthening of a vowel sound that happens upon the loss of a following consonant, usually in the syllable coda, or of a vowel in an adjacent syllable. Lengthening triggered by consonant loss may be considered an extreme form of fusion (Crowley 1997:46). Both types may arise from speakers' attempts to preserve a word's moraic count.\n\nAn example from the history of English is the lengthening of vowels that happened when the voiceless velar fricative and its palatal allophone were lost from the language. For example, in the Middle English of Chaucer's time the word \"night\" was phonemically ; later the was lost, but the was lengthened to to compensate, causing the word to be pronounced . (Later the became by the Great Vowel Shift.)\n\nBoth the Germanic spirant law and the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law show vowel lengthening compensating for the loss of a nasal.\n\nNon-rhotic forms of English have a lengthened vowel before a historical post-vocalic : in Scottish English, \"girl\" has a short followed by a light alveolar , as presumably it did in Middle English; in Southern British English, the has dropped out of the spoken form and the vowel has become a \"long schwa\" .\n\nCompensatory lengthening in Classical Hebrew and Aramaic is dependent on the class of consonant which follows the prefix (definite article in Hebrew and prefix waw-hahipukh in both languages).\n\nE.g. (using the Hebrew definite article [hey with pataḥ plus dagesh in following consonant]):\n\nCompensatory lengthening is very common in Ancient Greek. It is particularly notable in forms where \"n\" or \"nt\" comes together with \"s\", \"y\" (= ι̯), or \"i\". The development of \"nt\" + \"y\" was perhaps thus:\n\n\nForms with this type of compensatory lengthening include the nominative singular and dative plural of many participles, adjectives, and nouns, the 3rd person plural ending for present and future active of all verbs, and the 3rd person singular present of athematic verbs:\n\n\nIn the evolution of the modern Indo-Aryan languages, there is a first stage in which consonant clusters with dissimilar consonants preceded by a short vowel undergo assimilation resulting in consonant clusters with similar consonants. In the second stage, the first consonant of the cluster or geminate was lost, which was accompanied by the lengthening of that vowel and sometimes additional nasalization. In Punjabi, only the first stage occurred, while most of the other modern Indo-Aryan languages underwent the second stage as well.\n\n\n"}

Kerry, with a margin of victory of 79.84% over the incumbent George W. Bush, more than any state. This was also the largest Democratic margin of victory over a Republican candidate in the history of the district, but has since been surpassed by all presidential elections since. The greatest victory margin of these subsequent years was in 2016. Such victory margins may perhaps be attributed to the fact that D.C. only encompasses an urban core area (and those are generally very liberal in nature). A recent San Francisco study based on the 2004 presidential election exit polls, ranked Washington, D.C. as the 4th most liberal city in the country. This information supports the fact that the District of Columbia has never voted for a Republican.\n\n\n\"In bold is the best result of each candidate.\"\n\nTechnically the voters of D.C. cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. D.C. is allocated 3 electors. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 3 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 3 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president.

He won 9 times on the European Tour between 1972 and 1981 and twice won the Senior British Open.\n\nBarnes played in 6 consecutive Ryder Cup matches from 1969 to 1979. He was noted for having beaten Jack Nicklaus twice in one day in singles match play, during the 1975 Ryder Cup on 21 September, winning 4&2 in the morning round and 2&1 in the afternoon session.\n\nBarnes was born in Addington, Surrey, England, by Scottish parents, and represented England at international level. Barnes was educated at St.Dunstan's School, Burnham-on-Sea and Millfield School in Somerset.\n\nBarnes was taught golf by his father who was Secretary at Burnham and Berrow Golf Club. He won the British Youths Open Amateur Championship in 1964, having represented England in the youth international against Scotland that preceded the championship. He turned professional soon afterwards.\n\nBarnes became one of the \"Butten boys\", a group of young British professional golfers who were part of a training programme, funded by Ernest Butten, an entrepreneur and joint founder of PA Consulting Group. Starting in 1963, Butten had funded a residential golf school at Sundridge Park in Bromley, Kent. Max Faulkner was employed as the teaching professional.\n\nAfter turning professional Barnes continued to be considered an English golfer, representing England in the 1967 R.T.V. International Trophy. In 1971 he joined the Scottish PGA and subsequently played for Scotland in international competitions.\n\nBarnes won the Flame Lily Open in Rhodesia in March 1967 and won two British tournaments, the Agfa-Gevaert Tournament and the Coca-Cola Young Professionals' Championship, in 1969. In 1970 he won the Wills Masters in Australia.\n\nBarnes was one of the leading European Tour golfers in the early years after being founded in 1972. He placed between 4th and 8th on the Order of Merit every year from 1972 to 1980. He won nine events on the Tour between 1972 and 1981. He also played regularly on the east African Safari Tour, winning the Zambia Open in 1979 and the Kenya Open and Zambia Open in 1981.\n\nBarnes completed all four rounds of the Open Championship 16 times in succession from 1967 to 1982 and had three top ten finishes, the best of them a tie for fifth in 1972. He played in the Masters Tournament in 1972 and 1973 but missed the cut on both occasions.\n\nBarnes played for Great Britain & Ireland and finally Europe in six consecutive Ryder Cup matches from 1969 to 1979. He has a 10–14–1 win-loss-tie record including a 5–5–0 record in singles matches (there were two sets of singles matches in some of the Ryder Cups in which he participated). He had a successful partnership with Bernard Gallacher in foursomes and four-ball matches, the pair having 5 wins and a half in their 10 matches playing together. He is, however, best remembered for beating Jack Nicklaus twice in one day in 1975.\n\nIn 1995, Barnes became eligible to play in senior tournaments, and was very successful. He won the Senior British Open Championship in 1995 and became the first man to successfully defend the title in 1996. He topped the European Seniors Tour Order of Merit in 1995, and went on the play the Champions Tour in the late 1990s with moderate success. Arthritis hampered his career and forced him to leave tournament golf in 2000.\n\nBarnes was responsible for one of the worst putting performances ever seen in a professional tournament. During the 1968 French Open, Barnes missed a short putt on the par-3 8th hole. Angry with the miss, he then tried to rake the ball into the cup, but missed. He then hit the ball back and forth while it was still moving. After all of the missed putts and penalty strokes were counted, Barnes had scored a 15 for the hole.\n\nBarnes married Hilary Faulkner, the daughter of Max Faulkner, in 1968 and they had two children, Didi and Guy. Hilary died in 2014. After having heavy alcohol drinking habits during his life and golf career, in early 1993, he checked himself in for a successful drying-out period, remained sober and continued his golf career, two years later with great success in senior tournaments. Barnes died on 9 September 2019 of cancer at the age of 74, he was with his son and daughter at home.\n\n\nEuropean Tour playoff record (3–2)\n\n\n\"Note: Barnes only played in the Masters Tournament and The Open Championship.\"<br>\nCUT = missed the half-way cut<br>\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\n\n\n"}

He is a former federal deputy and former governor of Nuevo León (2003–2009) He is also married to Cristina Maiz\n\nGonzález Parás is the son of José Natividad González González and María Cristina Parás Barocio and a direct descendant of José María Parás, governor of the state (1825–1827 and 1848–1850). He received a bachelor's degree in law from the Autonomous University of Nuevo León, a master's degree in public administration from the French Public Administration International Institute (nowadays \"École nationale d'administration\", 1973) and a doctorate in political sciences from the University of Paris I \"(Panthéon-Sorbonne)\".\n\nHe joined the Institutional Revolutionary Party in 1967 and has taught several courses at \"El Colegio de México\", at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and at the Autonomous University of Nuevo León. From 1985 until 1991 he served as the state secretary general of Nuevo León and for a few years he served as undersecretary of political development at the Mexican Secretariat of the Interior during the Ernesto Zedillo administration.\n\nIn 1997 he ran for governor and lost against Fernando Canales Clariond, a wealthy businessman of the conservative National Action Party. Six years later he reattempted it and won by a clear margin over his closest opponent, Mauricio Fernández Garza.\n\nFollowing Barcelona's example, the Governor sought and gained for Monterrey the responsibility of hosting the 2007 Universal Forum of Cultures, an event that the city of Barcelona had used to renew its own infrastructure before. As parts of the works for the Forum, the Governor ordered an expansion of the metropolitan subway system, the remodeling of the city's main square, numerous infrastructure works, and other investments. The cost of these was financed by creating new debt mechanisms. Among them, the Transit Control Administration (Instituto de Control Vehicular), in charge of licensing plates and licensing drivers in the State, was made autonomous so that its income could be given as an insurance to bonds. The Monterrey - Cadereyta toll highway was turned into the \"Nuevo León State Highway Network\" (Red Estatal de Carreteras) so that its income and its assets be used to back more bonds. The State Government has argued, however, that the liabilities of decentralized organisms cannot be considered debt, and therefore the State's debt has been reduced. This argument is done despite the fact the decentralized organisms that have assumed debt where decentralized during this administration, and the opposition has accused the government of decentralizing with the sole purpose of acquiring debt. In fact, the issue sparked a controversy that had to be resolved by Mexico's Supreme Court. The financing through debt incurred by the State has risen so much that Nuevo León, the third richest state in the country, became the 4th most leveraged State in Mexico.\n\nAdditionally, the rising climate of insecurity, and drug-related assassinations in Mexico have made investors cautious about financial risk in Nuevo León as in other states. In April 2007, the US Department of State issued a warning for its citizens travelling to several states in Mexico including Nuevo León, which had accumulated 50 drug related assassinations in 2007.\n\nIn the presidential election of 2006, the PAN candidate won in all of the Northern states and the PRD candidate won in most of the central, south and southeastern states. The opposition PAN won the State Congress, marking the first time that the State Legislature will be ruled by an opposition party to the State Executive. Most of the municipalities in the State were also won by the opposition.\n\nGonzález has fostered the creation of 40 research centers in the state in his first four years as governor. González is currently negotiating the construction of an underground suburban train in the Monterrey area.\n\nUnder the González administration Nuevo León is the fourth state in property tax revenue in the country and is the second in GDP (after the Federal District) with 7.3% of the national GDP. The state has had a GDP growth of no less than 4.1% each year since González took office in 2003.\n\n"}
{"id": "2174875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174875", "title": "Qadiriyya", "text": "Qadiriyya\n\nThe Qadiriyya (, also transliterated \"Qadri\", \"Qadriya\", \"Kadri\", \"Elkadri\", \"Elkadry\", \"Aladray\", \"Alkadrie\", \"Adray\", \"Kadray\", \"Kadiri\", \"Qadiri\", \"Quadri\" or \"Qadri\") are members of the Qadiri tariqa (Sufi order). The tariqa got its name from Abdul Qadir Gilani (1077–1166, also transliterated \"Jilani\"), who was from Gilan. The order relies strongly upon adherence to the fundamentals of Islam.\n\nThe order, with its many offshoots, is widespread, particularly in the Arabic-speaking world, and can also be found in Turkey, Indonesia, Afghanistan, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Balkans, Russia, Palestine, Israel, China, and East and West Africa.\n\nThe founder of the Qadiriyya, Abdul Qadir Gilani, was a respected scholar and preacher. Having been a pupil at the madrasa of Abu Sa'id al-Mubarak, he became the leader of this school after al-Mubarak's death in 1119. Being the new sheikh, he and his large family lived in the \"madrasa\" until his death in 1166, when his son, Abdul Razzaq, succeeded his father as sheikh. Abdul Razzaq published a hagiography of his father, emphasizing his reputation as founder of a distinct and prestigious Sufi order.\n\nThe Qadiriyya flourished, surviving the Mongolian conquest of Baghdad in 1258, and remained an influential Sunni institution. After the fall of the Abbasid Caliphate, the legend of Gilani was further spread by a text entitled \"The Joy of the Secrets in Abdul-Qadir's Mysterious Deeds\" (\"Bahjat al-asrar fi ba'd manaqib 'Abd al-Qadir\") attributed to Nur al-Din 'Ali al-Shattanufi, who depicted Gilani as the ultimate channel of divine grace and helped the Qadiri order to spread far beyond the region of Baghdad.\n\nBy the end of the fifteenth century, the Qadiriyya had distinct branches and had spread to Morocco, Spain, Turkey, India, Ethiopia, Somalia, and present-day Mali. Established Sufi sheikhs often adopted the Qadiriyya tradition without abandoning leadership of their local communities. During the Safavid dynasty's rule of Baghdad from 1508 to 1534, the sheikh of the Qadiriyya was appointed chief Sufi of Baghdad and the surrounding lands. Shortly after the Ottoman Empire conquered Baghdad in 1534, Suleiman the Magnificent commissioned a dome to be built on the mausoleum of Abdul-Qadir Gilani, establishing the Qadiriyya as his main allies in Iraq.\n\nKhawaja Abdul-Allah, a sheikh of the Qadiriyya and a descendant of Muhammad, is reported to have entered China in 1674 and traveled the country preaching until his death in 1689. One of Abdul-Allah's students, Qi Jingyi Hilal al-Din, is said to have permanently rooted Qadiri Sufism in China. He was buried in Linxia City, which became the center of the Qadiriyya in China. By the seventeenth century, the Qadiriyya had reached Ottoman-occupied areas of Europe.\n\nSultan Bahu contributed to the spread of Qadiriyya in western India. His method of spreading the teachings of the Sufi doctrine of Faqr was through his Punjabi couplets and other writings, which numbered more than 140. He granted the method of dhikr and stressed that the way to reach divinity was not through asceticism or excessive or lengthy prayers but through selfless love carved out of annihilation in God, which he called \"fana\".\n\nSheikh Sidi Ahmad al-Bakka'i ( of the Kunta family, born in the region of the Noun river, d.1504 in Akka) established a Qadiri \"zawiya\" (Sufi residence) in Walata. In the sixteenth century the family spread across the Sahara to Timbuktu, Agades, Bornu, Hausaland, and other places, and in the eighteenth century large numbers of Kunta moved to the region of the middle Niger where they established the village of Mabruk. Sidi Al-Mukhtar al-Kunti (1728–1811) united the Kunta factions by successful negotiation, and established an extensive confederation. Under his influence the Maliki school of Islamic law was reinvigorated and the Qadiriyyah order spread throughout Mauritania, the middle Niger region, Guinea, the Ivory Coast, Futa Toro, and Futa Jallon. Kunta colonies in the Senegambian region became centers of Muslim teaching.\n\n\nThe spiritual chain (silsila) is listed as follows:\nAnother version is as follows:\n\nThe Halisa offshoot was founded by Abdurrahman Halis Talabani (12121275 Hijra) in Kerkuk, Iraq. Hungry and miserable people were fed all day in his Tekke without regard for religion. Dawlati Osmaniyya donated money and gifts to his Tekke in Kerkuk. Sultan Abdul-Majid Khan's (Khalife of İslam, Sultan of Ottoman Empire) wife Sultana Hatun sent many gifts and donations to his Tekke as a follower. Among his followers were many leaders, rulers, and military and government officials. It was known to everyone that he lived in complete conviction. Because of the example Talibani set as a religious figure, the people's ties to him were solid and strong.\n\nAfter his death, his branch was populated in Turkey, and he was followed by Dede Osman Avni Baba, Sheikh Al-Haj Ömer Hüdai Baba, Sheikh Al-Haj Muhammed Baba, Sheikh Al-Haj Mustafa Hayri Baba, and Sheikh Al-Haj Mehmet Baba.\n\nThe Qadri Noshahi silsila (offshoot) was established by Syed Muhammad Naushah Ganj Bakhsh of Gujrat, Punjab, Pakistan, in the late sixteenth century. \n\nAlso known as Qadiriya Sultaniya, the order was started by Sultan Bahu in the seventeenth century and spread in the western part of Indian Subcontinent. Hence, it follows most of the Qadiriyya approach. In contrast, it does not follow a specific dress code or require seclusion or other lengthy exercises. Its mainstream philosophy is contemplation of belovedness towards God.\n\nThis branch of the Qadiriyya came into being in the eighteenth century resulting from a revivalist movement led by Al-Mukhtar al-Kunti, a Sufi of the western Sahara who wished to establish Qadiri Sufism as the dominant religion in the region. In contrast to other branches of the Qadiriyya that do not have a centralized authority, the Mukhtariyya brotherhood was highly centralized. Its leaders focused on economic prosperity as well as spiritual well-being, sending their disciples on trade caravans as far away as Europe.\n\nThe founder of the Qadiriyya Harariya tariqa was Shaykh Hachime Harari. His shrine is located in Harar City, Ethiopia. All the shrines of the shaykhs are in Ethiopia and two Shrines of the shaykhs silsila are in Borama City, in the north of Somalia. The current shaykh is Mohamed Nasrudin bin Shaykh Ibrahim Kulmiye of Somalia. The tariqa spread in three countries: Djibouti, Somalia, and Ethiopia.\n\nFounded by AlaHazrat Imam Ahmad Raza Khan . The current leader and successor is Taajusharia Mufti Akhtar Raza Khan Barelvi. With million of followers around the world, the current successor also is listed 25th among the most influential Muslim leaders around the world.\n\n\n"}

They were heavily influenced by legendary disco band Chic. The current incarnation of the group reformed in 2018.\n\nChange was initially formed in early 1979 as a studio-band with a revolving cast of musicians, led by businessman and executive producer Jacques Fred Petrus, with the majority of song-writing and production carried out by Mauro Malavasi and Davide Romani.\n\nThe band's dual Italian and American identity was a result of a production system in which the music, excepting the vocals, were written and recorded by Italian collaborators in studios such as Fontoprint Studios, Bologna, Italy. The backing tracks were then taken to the USA where vocals were added by American performers, before being mixed into finalised versions in major studios such as the Power Station in New York City.\n\nThe band's debut album, \"The Glow of Love\", was released on Ray Caviano's label, Warner/RFC Records in 1980. It was composed by a small team of writers made up of Romani, Malavasi, Paolo Gianolio (lead guitarist), Tanyayette Willoughby, Paul Slade and Wayne Garfield. The first single was the million seller \"A Lover's Holiday\" featuring the ad lib stylings of Zachary Sanders, known then for his work on \"Schoolhouse Rock\". The follow-up hits from the album, \"Searching\" and the title song, feature lead vocals by Luther Vandross who had yet to come to prominence. The three songs combined set the all-time record, spending nine (9) weeks at #1 on \"Billboard\"s Club Play Singles chart, enough to make it the #1 Disco recording of the year and a strong seller in the U.S. It also made the Pop Top 40 that summer. The success of \"Searching\" and \"The Glow of Love\" exposed Luther's voice to mainstream and eventually led to a successful solo career soon afterward.\n\nAt the time \"The Glow of Love\" was released, the group also drew comparisons to another Disco act at the time, Chic, who not only were Change's label mates at Atlantic Records, but also shared the backing vocalists as well.\n\nThe follow-up album, \"Miracles \" was released in 1981. It was created by the same collection of writers and producers as had worked on the debut album. Due to contractual differences, Vandross refused to sing lead vocals on any of the album's tracks and was only featured on backing vocals on selected songs. After \"Miracles\", Vandross continued to provide backup vocals for the group until 1981, when he left Change to pursue his solo career. Petrus and Malavasi signed up James 'Crab' Robinson to replace Vandross, owing to his ability to perform in a similar vocal style. Robinson shared vocals with Diva Gray for the album.\n\n\"Miracles\" was released to a similar level of success as the début, though it did not manage to produce a mainstream crossover hit such as \"A Lover’s Holiday\". The three singles from the album, \"Paradise\", \"Hold Tight\" and \"Heaven of My Life\" all reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Club Play Singles chart in 1981.\n\nChange's 1982 album, \"Sharing Your Love\", moved the band further away from disco and club music and into genres such as R&B and Funk. The lead single, \"The Very Best In You\", was one of the foremost examples of the group's take on R&B. The album also marked a new process in the writing of the band's albums. The team behind the first albums contributing less, instead a wide range of songs by other writers were recorded. Overall, the album continued a slowly declining trend in the commercial fortunes for the project, though the album sold well and \"The Very Best In You\" was popular.\n\nDuring the recording and touring of their fourth album, \"This Is Your Time\" (1983) Change's relatively stable line-up of performers, writers and producers as well as their commercial success faltered. The album failed to chart a major hit, with the title track flopping in comparison to previous lead singles. After the album's release Rick Brennan stepped into the place of Robinson who left to pursue a solo career, while producers Davide Romani and Mauro Malavasi departed for other projects.\n\nAt the same time of these important departures, Change was bolstered by the contributions of bassist and songwriter Timmy Allen and returning vocalist Deborah Cooper now promoted to lead, both of whom remained in the band until its demise. After Change, Cooper worked with the C+C Music Factory in the 1990s.\n\nThe failure of the 1983 album left future of Change in jeopardy. Petrus wisely hired recently sacked Time members Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to write and produce what would become \"Change Of Heart\" in 1984.\n\nThe album did well internationally, returning the group to the charts in Europe and the USA. The title track became Change's first top ten R&B hit in three years. Unlike former Change albums which had a large number of songwriters, \"Change of Heart\" was written by just three writers, four tracks were by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis' partnership while the remaining four were the work of Timmy Allen.\n\nThis upturn in fortune was soon cancelled out. As with previous collaborators, Petrus fell out with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis over a financial dispute, reportedly, the duo was never paid in full. Their loss was huge to the group, as Allen's efforts had fallen short of Jam and Lewis', and were closer to filler.\n\nNevertheless, Allen was given the opportunity by Petrus to write and produce the majority of what became Change's final album in 1985, \"Turn on Your Radio\". This album bore little of the polished dance and R&B sound that the group had always emphasised, and was less successful even than \"This Is Your Time\", though Europe remained receptive to the group. The band's final US hit \"Let's Go Together\" was notable as it was co-written by Petrus with returning collaborators Davide Romani and Paul Slade.\n\n\"Turn on Your Radio\" was the band's commercial low point, but had not been intended as the act's final release. The formal end came after the death of Petrus in 1987.\n\nWhile the original Change disappeared after Petrus’ death, Davide Romani, Mike Francis, a.k.a. Francesco Puccioni (1961–2009), and Patrick Boothe attempted to revive the project in 1990. This new Change project was planned for a release on BMG North America under the name X-Change in 1992, but due to lack of money, the album was left unreleased.\n\nThe availability of the X-Change recordings was resolved in 2009 after Romani closed a deal with Italian label Fonte Records to release the album later that same year as \"Change Your Mind\", it was produced by Romani and Puccioni, written by Romani, Puccioni and Boothe, with Boothe as the main lead vocalist. In 2001, American R&B/pop singer Janet Jackson featured a sample of Change's \"The Glow Of Love\" in her number 1 single \"All for You\".\n\nIn 2018, Change returned with original members Davide Romani and Mauro Malavasi, and new vocalist Tanya Michelle Smith. The reformed act also released their first single and video, “Hit or Miss,” in June 2018, which is the lead off track from “Love 4 Love,” a nine-song set scheduled for a September 2018 release.\n\nChange was effectively a studio group composed of session musicians and a core group of collaborators led by Jacques Fred Petrus and Mauro Malavasi. After the release of \"The Glow of Love\" and \"Miracles\", Petrus sought to give the group more of an image and put together a group for promotion and live performances. This second line up was relatively stable and contributed to the group's subsequent four albums. Since their final album, there has been tours and shows featuring a revolving number of musicians and singers carrying on the Change name.\n\n\n\nThe discography of Change includes seven studio albums, eight compilations and twenty-five singles.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2174884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174884", "title": "Fillomino", "text": "Fillomino\n\nFillomino (フィルオミノ) is a type of logic puzzle published by many publishers. Other published titles for the puzzle include \"Allied Occupation\".\n\n\"Fillomino\" is played on a rectangular grid with no standard size; the internal grid lines are often dotted. (When published as \"Allied Occupation\" in the World Puzzle Championship, the cells of the grid are circular, but this is purely an aesthetic concern.) Some cells of the grid start containing numbers, referred to as \"givens\". The goal is to divide the grid into polyominoes (by filling in their boundaries) such that each given number \"n\" in the grid is part of an \"n\"-omino and that no two polyominoes of matching size (number of cells) are orthogonally adjacent (share a side).\n\nUnlike some of its contemporaries among puzzles, there need not be a one-to-one correspondence between givens and polyominoes in the solution; it is possible for two givens with matching number to belong to the same polyomino in the solution, and for a polyomino to have no given at all.\n\nIt is common practice in solving a \"Fillomino\" puzzle to add numbers to the empty cells when it is determined what size polyomino each must belong to; these numbers are effectively treated identically to the givens. As well as making it clear where many border segments must be drawn - such as between any two differing numbers, or surrounding a region of matching numbers whose quantity is that number - it also permits the second part of the puzzle's rule to be visualized as simply \"the same number cannot appear on both sides of a border\", which greatly accelerates solving. A curious side effect of numbering every cell is that when the puzzle is completed, the numbers alone unambiguously define the solution, the actual borders being trivially deducible. This makes communication of a solution without a grid quite feasible; indeed, solutions for \"Allied Occupation\" give only the numbers. (Nikoli always publishes solutions to their \"Fillomino\" puzzles with both the polyomino borders drawn in and numbers given in every cell.)\n\nThe typical means of starting a \"Fillomino\" puzzle is to draw in the obvious borders between non-matching givens and surrounding all polyominoes completed by the givens alone ('1's, pairs of orthogonally adjacent '2's, and so on). From there, the solver searches for three things, possibly in combination:\n\n\nFillomino adapts to different geometries; hexagonal grids can be used, with the only change in the rules being replacing all instances of \"polyomino\" with \"polyhex\". Another variant was published by Nikoli under the name \"NIKOJI\"; letters are used as givens instead of numbers, where the letters and polyominoes have a one-to-one correspondence and only matching letters have matching polyominoes (in size, shape, orientation, and letter position).\n\nA computer-based variant of the game in which the player enters numbers (the computer draws the boundaries for the player) is known \"Filling\" and is part of the \"SGT-Puzzles\" package.\n\nAn iOS mobile variant of Fillomino, named Fields, was launched in 2013. \n"}

He is played by Basil Rathbone.\n\nWolf Frankenstein was the elder son of Henry Frankenstein and brother to Ludwig Frankenstein. He was sent to England when he was very young to receive a proper education. After obtaining his doctoral degree, marrying his girlfriend Elsa, and fathering a son named Peter, he moved to America and began a medical practice where he could live and breathe freely from the bad reputation that came with his family name. However, his father's history caught up with him eventually when Henry finally died leaving his entire estate to Wolf (one can assume that the estate was originally supposed to go to Ludwig, who, true to his disdain for Henry's work, refused it, dumping the burden on his brother).\n\nHaving spent most of his life away from his ancestral home, Wolf didn't know the whole story of how his father had created the monster, and assumed that the story had become grossly exaggerated over the years. thus, his only reason for accepting the Frankenstein estate was in the hopes of clearing the family name (making him the first of many well-intentioned by nonetheless doomed descendants of Henry) by proving to the people of Frankenstein that his father's work was, at its core, good. Initially this seemed doomed to failure, as everyone in town - with the exception of the open-minded police officer Inspector Krogh - was openly hostile towards Wolf and his family.\n\nRegardless, Wolf soldiered on, setting up shop in Henry's old laboratory, during which time he discovered that an old demented man named Ygor (who has a deformed neck upon surviving a hanging upon his graverobbing attempts) had been using the heretofore-abandoned building as a sanctuary. After almost killing one another, Wolf and Ygor seemed to become fast friends, with the old man revealing that not only was his father's creation alive since the destruction of the laboratory in Henry's time, but that the Monster was living in the Frankenstein family crypt and was in poor health. Wolf then sees that his father were buried with the chalk writing on his stone casket stating \"Henrich von Frankenstein: Maker of Monsters.\" Seeing this as an opportunity to fulfill his dream of redeeming his family, Wolf agreed to help Ygor restore the Monster to full health, little knowing that Ygor had sinister plans of his own for the bolt-necked giant. Wolf starts out by using the torch to etch out the word \"Monsters\" on the casket and write \"Men\" in its place.\n\nThese plans eventually came to light following the disappearance of Wolf's butler Thomas Benson (whom Wolf suspected that the increasingly hostile Ygor) had murdered. Following the deaths of Emil Lang and Edwald Niemuller at the hands of the Monster, Inspector Krogh came calling with dire news: the townspeople rightly blamed Ygor for the killings, but were accusing Wolf of harboring the madman.\n\nRealizing that Ygor had lied to him (and concluding that Ygor had in fact killed Benson), Wolf went to the lab to confront him. Ygor knew why Wolf was there and attacked him with a hammer. But Wolf, better armed than his foe, shot Ygor with a revolver and seemingly killed him. Thinking the horror was over, he returned to Krogh, only to find that the Monster (in an effort to avenge the seeming death of his friend) had kidnapped Peter and was threatening to drop the boy into the sulphur pits that existed beneath the laboratory. But thanks to the efforts of Krogh, Peter was saved and Wolf swung on a rope and knocked the Monster into the sulphur instead.\n\nAfter all this, Wolf decided to move back to America with Elsa and Peter. Wolf later handed the keys to the Frankenstein estate over to the townspeople.\n\nWolf was later mentioned in \"The Ghost of Frankenstein\" where Ludwig had heard about his brother's encounter with the monster.\n"}

It is an allegory of a Christian devotional life from salvation through maturity. It aims to show how a Christian is transformed from unbeliever to immature believer to mature believer, who walks daily with God as easily on the High Places of Joy in the spirit as in the daily life of mundane and often humiliating tasks that may cause Christians to lose perspective.\n\nThe book takes its title from Habakkuk 3:19, \"The Lord God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.\"\n\nThe story begins in the Valley of Humiliation with Much Afraid, being beset by the unwanted advances of her cousin, Craven Fear, who wishes to marry her. Much Afraid is ugly from all outward appearances, walking on club feet, sporting gnarled, deformed hands, and speaking from a crooked mouth that seems to have been made so by a stroke or the like.\n\nThe Good Shepherd is tender and gentle with Much Afraid, especially in the beginning. However, His many sudden departures may strike the reader as bizarre, given the human penchant to expect kindly souls to never do anything that may be interpreted as rude or as hurtful in any way. Yet, though the Shepherd leaves in a moment, He returns the same way at the first furtive cry of the forlorn little protagonist. \"Come, Shepherd, for I am much afraid!\"\n\nWhen Much Afraid intimates that she would love to be able to dance upon the high places as do the sure-footed deer, the Shepherd commends her for this desire. In order to accomplish this, he offers to \"plant the seed of love\" into her heart. At first sight of the long, black hawthorn-looking seed, she shrieks in fear. Soon, she relents, and after the initial intense pain, she senses that something is indeed different in her, though she still looks the same, for now.\n\nJust when the reader thinks that Much Afraid is about to reach the High Places, the path turns downward towards a seemingly endless desert. There is incident with an extremely high cliff that must be ascended by a steep, slippery and very narrow zig-zagging track, with the help of her two companions, Sorrow and Suffering. Then days are spent in a forest that is shrouded in a thick cloud of fog. During this time Much Afraid is sequestered with her two friends in a log cabin. The climax is an unexpected twist that comes as Much Afraid despairs of ever reaching the High Places.\n\nThe book bears some stylistic similarities to John Bunyan's \"The Pilgrim's Progress\". The name of the protagonist, Much-Afraid, also appears first in Bunyan's work.\n\n"}

They formed in 1995, with a line-up of Helmkamp, guitarist Gene Palubicki, and drummer John Longstreth, and recorded a demo, \"Goats to Azazael\", which led to a contract with Osmose Productions. The band's debut album, \"Hammer of Gods\", was released in 1996, after which rhythm guitarist Bill Taylor joined, playing on second album \"Exterminate\" (1998). Drummer Tony Laureano joined shortly after its release but Taylor left. The band's third album, \"The Inexorable\", was released in the fall of 1999, after which Taylor rejoined. While on tour with Immortal, Satyricon, and Krisiun, in support of \"The Inexorable\", the band had an accident in their tour van, in which Helmkamp was injured. On the same tour, Helmkamp's girlfriend was stabbed, and he decided to leave the band. The rest of the band continued for a while but decided to split up. \n\nIn 2006, the band reformed and recorded a new album. Helmkamp said of the reunion: \"It just seems like the planets realigned. It's not like we didn't get along or that there were any bridges to mend.\"\n\nTheir lyrical themes are generally concerned with warfare. The band has been involved in a number of American and European tours involving other metal acts such as Immortal, Krisiun, Cianide, and Watain. An East Coast USA tour was completed in May 2007. In 2008 the band embarked on a larger European tour with Revenge and Arkhon Infaustus throughout Europe, this tour included a performance at the United Metal Maniacs Open Air Festival in Bitterfeld Germany. Upon returning to the US, live dates on the West Coast with Cemetery Urn, Sanguis Imperum, Gospel of the Horns, and Ares Kingdom were completed. On April 7, 2009, the members announced disbandment, citing \"musical differences\" as the reason.\n\nHelmkamp claimed that the band is fueled by \"the constant struggle, strife, camaraderie, and unified will that forged the iron, blood, and blasphemy of our music and lyrics\".\n\nAs of 2015, the band temporarily reformed for select live dates, though it was repeatedly stressed that it was a one-time live reunion that would not produce new material. Upon concluding their reunion live dates in 2017, the band split up permanently.\n\n\nWhile Angelcorpse's main material is released on Osmose, the singles, EPs, and live albums were released on Gene Palubicki's Evil Vengeance Records.\n\n\n\n"}

He is god of justice therefore known as Dharmaraja. Upon their death, Chitragupta has the task of deciding heaven or the hell for the humans, depending on their actions on the earth. Chitragupta Maharaj is the seventeenth Manasputra of Lord Brahma. Chitragupta is believed to be created from Bramha's soul & mind (chitt) and thus, alloted the right to write Vedas like Brahmins with the duty of a Kshatriya.\n\n\nChitragupta came into being after Brahma, the creator, having established the four varnas — Brahmin (The Learned), Kshatriya (The Warriors), Vaishya (Merchant) and Shudra (Labourer or Farmer) — ordained Dharamraj (also called Yamraj, the god of death) to keep record of the deeds — good and evil — of all life-forms born and yet to be born on earth, in the heavens above and in the lands below. Dharamraj, however, complained, \"O Lord, how can I alone keep record of the deeds of the beings born into 84 lakh yonis (life-forms) in the three worlds\"\n\nBrahma went into meditation for 11,000 years and when he opened his eyes he saw a man holding pen and ink-pot in his hands and a sword girdled to his waist. Brahma spoke: Brahma then enjoined him to dispense justice and punish those who violated the dharma.\n\nIn the \"Garuda Purana\", Chitragupta is hailed as the \"giver of letters\" (\"Chitragupta namastubhyam vedaksaradatre\").\n\nIn the legends of Chitragupta as well as in the Vedas, he is referred to as the greatest king, while the rest are \"Rajakas,\" or little kings.\n\nचित्र इद राजा राजका इदन्यके यके सरस्वतीमनु।<br>\nपर्जन्य इव ततनद धि वर्ष्ट्या सहस्रमयुता ददत॥ RIG VEDA Book 8/ Hymn 21/ Stanza 18\n\nThe Rig Veda mentions an invocation to be made to Chitragupta before offering sacrifice. There is also a special invocation to Chitragupta as Dharmraj (Lord of Justice) to be made at the performance of shradh or other rituals. \"Om tat purushaya vidmahe Chitragupta dhimahi tena lekha prachodayata.\"\n\nChitragupta is the Athi Devathai for Ketu, one of the Navagrahas, and those who worship Chitragupta, would be bestowed with prosperity.

Bhagat Singh Thind, 261 U.S. 204 (1923), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States decided that Bhagat Singh Thind, an Indian Sikh man who identified himself as an Aryan, was ineligible for naturalized citizenship in the United States. In 1919, Thind filed a petition for naturalization under the Naturalization Act of 1906 which allowed only \"free white persons\" and \"aliens of African nativity and persons of African descent\" to become United States citizens by naturalization.\n\nAfter his petition was granted, Government attorneys initiated a proceeding to cancel Thind's naturalization and a trial followed in which the Government presented evidence of Thind's political activities as a founding member of the Ghadar Party, an Indian independence movement headquartered in San Francisco. Thind did not challenge the constitutionality of the racial restrictions. Instead, he attempted to be classified as a \"free white person\" within the meaning of the Naturalization Act based on the fact that Indians and Europeans share common descent from Proto-Indo-Europeans.\n\nThind was represented by a fellow Indian American, Sakharam Ganesh Pandit, a California attorney. The court unanimously rejected Thind's argument, holding that while Indians shared common ancestry with Europeans, they did not meet a \"common sense\" definition of white.\n\nBhagat Singh Thind had come to the United States in 1913 for higher studies after obtaining a bachelor's degree in India. He enlisted in the United States Army, became a Sergeant and served in the First World War. He was discharged honorably with his character designated as \"excellent\". Thind was granted citizenship in Washington state in July 1918 but his citizenship was rescinded in just four days. He received his citizenship for the second time in Oregon state in November 1920 after the Bureau of Naturalization was unsuccessful in its efforts to stall it in Oregon court. The case then reached the Supreme Court, where Sakharam Ganesh Pandit, a California attorney and fellow immigrant, represented Thind.\n\nThind argued that Indo-Aryan languages are indigenous to the Aryan part of India in the same way that Aryan languages are indigenous to Europe, highlighting the linguistic ties between Indo-Aryan speakers and Europeans, as most European languages including English are similar to Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi.\n\nSince the \"Ozawa v. United States\" court case had just decided that the meaning of white people for the purposes of the Court were people who were members of the Caucasian race, Thind argued that he was a white person by arguing that he was a member of the Caucasian race. Thind argued using \"a number of anthropological texts\" that people in Punjab and other Northwestern Indian states belonged to the \"Aryan race\", and Thind cited scientific authorities such as Johann Friedrich Blumenbach as classifying Aryans as belonging to the Caucasian race. Thind argued that, although some racial mixing did indeed occur between the Indian castes, the caste system had largely succeeded in India at preventing race-mixing. Thind argued that by being a \"high-caste, of full Indian blood\" he was a \"Caucasian\" according to the anthropological definitions of his day.\n\nThind's lawyers argued that Thind had a revulsion to marrying an Indian woman of the \"lower races\" when they said, \"The high-caste Hindu regards the aboriginal Indian Mongoloid in the same manner as the American regards the Negro, speaking from a matrimonial standpoint.\" Thind's lawyers argued that Thind had a revulsion to marrying a woman of the Mongoloid race. This would characterize Thind as being both white and someone who would be sympathetic to the existing anti-miscegenation laws in the United States.\n\nAssociate Justice George Sutherland said that authorities on the subject of race were in disagreement over which people were included in the scientific definition of the Caucasian race, so Sutherland instead chose to rely on the common understanding of race rather than the scientific understanding of race. Sutherland found that, while Thind may claim to have \"purity of Aryan blood\" due to being \"born in Village Taragarh Talawa near Jandiala Guru, Amritsar, Punjab\", he was not Caucasian in the \"common understanding\", so he could not be included in the \"statutory category as white persons\".\n\nThe Court reiterated its holding in [\"Ozawa v. United States\"], explaining that the words \"free white person\" in the naturalization act were \"synonymous with the word 'Caucasian' only as that word is popularly understood,\" pointing out that the statutory language was to be interpreted as \"words of common speech and not of scientific origin, ... written in the common speech, for common understanding, by unscientific men.\" Justice Sutherland wrote in his summary:\n\nThe 1910 Encyclopædia Britannica entry on \"Hinduism\" that Justice Sutherland cites as his sole source for this history contradicts his conclusion about the Aryans of Thind's birthplace in the Punjab and explicitly refers to the Aryans of India as part of \"the white race.\"\n\nThe Court nonetheless also concluded that \"the term 'Aryan' has to do with linguistic, and not at all with physical, characteristics, and it would seem reasonably clear that mere resemblance in language, indicating a common linguistic root buried in remotely ancient soil, is altogether inadequate to prove common racial origin.\"\n\nThe Court argued that the exclusion of non-whites was based on the idea of racial difference rather than the idea that one race is superior or inferior to another race. The Court argued that the racial difference between Indians and whites was so great that the \"great body of our people\" would reject assimilation with Indians.\n\nIn conclusion, the Court also noted that \"Congress, by the Act of February 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 874, c. 29, § 3, has now excluded from admission into this country all natives of Asia within designated limits of latitude and longitude, including the whole of India,\" suggesting its intention that natives of India also be excluded from eligibility for naturalized citizenship.\n\nAs a result of the U.S. Supreme Court decision finding that no person of Indian origin could become a naturalized American, the first person from the Indian subcontinent to become an American citizen, A. K. Mozumdar, had his citizenship revoked. A decision on his appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that revocation.\n\nNot only were new applicants from India denied the privilege of naturalization, but the new racial classification suggested that the retroactive revocation of naturalization certificates granted to Asian Indians, of which there were many, might be supported by the Court's decision, a point that some courts upheld when United States attorneys petitioned to cancel the naturalization certificates previously granted to many Asian Indians. Up to fifty Indian-Americans had their citizenship revoked between 1923 and 1927 as a consequence of the Thind ruling. Even Thind's own lawyer, Sakharam Ganesh Pandit, was targeted for denaturalization. However, Pandit successfully argued before the Ninth Circuit that revoking his citizenship would do him and his wife unfair harm under the equitable estoppel doctrine. His citizenship was upheld, and the Bureau of Naturalization subsequently cancelled its pending denaturalization cases against Indian-Americans.\n\nSome of the consequences of revoked naturalized status are illustrated by the example of some Asian Indian landowners living in California who found themselves under the jurisdiction of the California Alien Land Law of 1913. Specifically, Attorney General Ulysses S. Webb was very active in revoking Indian land purchases; in a bid to strengthen the Asiatic Exclusion League, he promised to prevent Indians from buying or leasing land. Under intense pressure, and with Immigration Act of 1917 preventing fresh immigration to strengthen the fledgling Indian-American community, many Indians left the United States, leaving only half their original American population, 2,405, by 1940.\n\nThind petitioned for naturalization a third time in 1935 after the Congress passed the Nye-Lea Act, which made World War I veterans eligible for naturalization regardless of race. Based on his status as a veteran of the United States military during World War I, he was finally granted United States citizenship nearly two decades after he first petitioned for naturalization. Numerous instances also exist of naïve clerks, or clerks acting in protest, granting citizenship to Asian Indian and other Asian immigrants in defiance of the Supreme Court.\n\nAs public support for Asian Indians grew throughout World War II, and as India's independence came closer to reality, Indians argued for an end to their legislative discrimination. The repeal of Chinese exclusion laws in 1943 and the granting of naturalization privileges to Chinese encouraged Asian Indians to hope for similar gains. Hurdling over many members of Congress and the American Federation of Labor, which vehemently opposed removing legislative measures barricading Indian immigration and naturalization, the Asian Indian community finally succeeded in gaining support among several prominent congressmen, as well as President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The support culminated in the signing into law by President Truman on July 2, 1946, of the Luce–Celler Act. This Act reversed the Thind decision by explicitly extending racial eligibility for naturalization to natives of India, and set a token quota for their immigration at 100 per year.\n\n\n"}

In his early works, he developed a personal style of landscape painting, with an emphasis on the Flemish countryside and country life. His later landscapes painted in England retained their Flemish character by representing a universal theme. Siberechts also painted hunting scenes for his English patrons. The topographical views he created in England stand at the beginning of the English landscape tradition.\n\nJan Siberechts was born in Antwerp, the son of a sculptor with the same name. He trained in Antwerp with his father and became a master in the local Guild of Saint Luke by 1648. It is possible but not certain that in the late 1640s, early 1650s he visited Italy. He married Maria-Anna Croes in Antwerp in 1652. He developed a personal style of painting landscapes, which impressed George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham when he visited Antwerp in 1670. The Duke invited the artist to England.\nSiberechts arrived in England around 1672 and spent the first three years in England painting decorations in the Duke’s newly built Cliveden House at Taplow, Buckinghamshire, England. From the second part of the 1670s and in the 1680s he travelled widely in England completing numerous commissions for aristocratic clients. He lived in London where one of his daughters was a lace-maker for the Queen. His younger daughter, Frances, married the Flemish émigré sculptor Artus Quellinus III (known in England as 'Arnold Quellinus') and, after being widowed, John Nost, another Flemish émigré sculptor. Whilst in London he was commissioned to paint the Belsize Estate of goldsmith banker John Coggs in 1696, which now hangs in the Tate Gallery London.\n\nHe died in London.\n\nJohn Wootton was one of his pupils.\n\nAbout 100 of his works have been preserved. His early works were indebted to Dutch Italianate landscape painters such as Nicolaes Berchem and Karel Dujardin. Siberechts must have become acquainted with their work in Antwerp as these artists were mainly active in Rome and Siberechts possibly did not visit Italy himself although such a visit in the late 1640s, early 1650s cannot be excluded.\n\nIn the 1660s he developed a very personal style of landscape painting, with an emphasis on the Flemish countryside and country life. He introduced into the foreground of his landscapes figures of robust country girls, dressed in bright red, blue and yellow. These countrywomen are shown traveling in carts, on foot and on the backs of mules and in the act of carrying objects, bundles or baskets or crossing flooded roads or fords. The volumetric modeling and the manner in which they are set against brightly lit areas of the countryside make the figures stand out from the picture. The artist used the figures to play with the visual effects produced by the figures in the water.\nHis later landscapes painted in England in the 1670s and 1680s retained their Flemish character by representing a universal theme. This stands in contrast to Dutch landscape paintings of the period, which typically concentrated on a single aspect of a landscape. Siberechts' landscapes depicted powerful trees and soft light on distant hills while the figures became less important than the landscape itself. The foreground was kept relatively dark in order to draw attention to the broad, brightly lit vista in the background.\nSiberechts also painted hunting scenes for his English patrons. These are the earliest country house portraits in England. He used a fairly standardised composition for these hunting scenes: the hunting scene with the huntsmen and horsemen in the foreground and a naturalistic view of the stately home as the backdrop, placed in a misty and atmospheric landscape. He adopted a bird's-eye view that allowed a maximum amount of detail to be depicted.\n\nThese country house portraits had an important influence on English landscape painting and Siberechts can be regarded as the ‘father of British landscape’. These landscapes also have an important historic and topographical interest. Siberechts stood at the beginning of a long tradition of Flemish painters who made topographical paintings of the estates of the British nobility. These artists include Peter Tillemans, Pieter Andreas Rijsbrack and Hendrik Frans de Cort.\n"}

He was born into a Berber family in Aïn Madhi in Algeria, and died in Fez, Morocco, at the age of 80.\n\nTijani was born in 1735 in Ain Madi, the son of Muhammad al-Mukhtar. He traced his descent to a Berber Tribe, Tijania. When he was sixteen, Tijani lost both parents as a result of a plague. By then he was already married. He learned Quran under the tutelage of Mohammed Ba'afiyya in Ain Madi and also studied Khalil ibn Ishaq al-Jundi's Islamic jusrispudence works that were written under Malikite rites. He also studied Abū al-Qāsim al-Qushayrī's Risala ila al-sufiyya. In 1757, Tijani left his village for Fez. While there, he joined three Sufi brotherhoods, the Qadiriyya, the Nasiriyya, and the tariqa of Ahmad al-Habib b. Muhammed. In Fez, he met a seer who told him he would achieve spiritual revelation (fath). Thereafter, he left Fez to teach at al-Abiad, spending five years at the village. In 1772, he began a journey to Mecca for hajj and to seek a Sufi way of life. During his journey, he was initiated into the Khalwati order at Azwawi. He later taught for a year at Tunis where he achieved some success. He left Tunis for Egypt where he met Mahmud al-Kurdi of the Khalwati order in Cairo. Tijani reached Mecca in late 1773 and performed hajj rites. In his quest to seek a Sufi way of life, he met Sheikh Ahmad Abdullah El Hindi, who rarely saw people except for his servant. He also met Abd-karim al-Sammman, founder of the Sammaniyya branch of Khalwati. Al-Samman told Tijani he will become a dominant \"qutb\" (pole) or scholar within the Sufi orders in the region. Tijani left Mecca and returned to Cairo where he got al-Kurdi's blessing to preach the Khalwatiyya order. From Cairo he settled at Tlemcen for a couple of years.\n\nTijani later settled at Boussemghoun, an oasis seventy five miles south of El Bayadh. It was at Samghun that Tijani received a vision from the prophet who told him to start a new Sufi order. He left his previous affiliations with other Sufi orders and claimed divine instructions from prophet Mohammed. Tijani's order soon gained attraction in the desert regions surrounding Abi Samghun. Shaykh Tijani lived in Abi Samghun for about fifteen years. In 1796 he went to Fez, marking the real beginning of his Tariqa.\n\nIn Fez, Tijani was well received by Mawlay Sulayman, the Moroccan Sultan. Though Sulayman disliked other Sufi orders, he provided Tijani a house and appointed him as a member of his learned council. At first, Tijani chose the mosque of Mawlay Idris to pray but performed the rites of the Tijani order in his house. Tijani later built his own zawiya. In Fez, he sent his trusted aides to spread the word of his order. Trusted aides such as Abu Hafs' Abdul-Rahman was sent to Oran and Algiers and Abdul-Salam al-Waghiri to Constantine, Algeria. Further muqaddams were appointed among learned converts including Muhammad Fuwadir al-Abdallawi in the Jarid district of Tunisia and Muhammed al-Hafiz in Mauritania.\n\nTijani assigned to himself the title of Qutb al-Aqtab (or the Pole of the Poles) and Khatm al-Walayya al-Muhammadiyya (or the Seal of Muhammadan Sainthood).\n\nHe is quoted as saying \n\nThe greater part of the life and teaching of Shaykh Tijani can be drawn from two primary hagiographical works:\n\nLater hagiographies tend to be works of compilation drawn from these two primary sources. Such hagiographies are:\n\nMost of what we know about Shaykh Tijani comes from these books.\n\n\n"}

Vehicles continued to be manufactured under the Albion brand until 1972, after which they continued to be produced, but were sold under the Leyland brand. Vehicle production at the former Albion factory in the Scotstoun area of Glasgow, Scotland, continued until 1980.\n\nOriginally known as \"Albion Motor Car Company Ltd\", the company was founded in 1899 by Thomas Blackwood Murray and Norman Osborne Fulton (both of whom had previously been involved in Arrol-Johnston). Murray's father, John Lamb Murray mortgaged the Heavyside estate in Biggar, South Lanarkshire, to provide the initial capital. They were joined a couple of years later by John F Henderson who provided additional capital. The factory was originally on the first floor of a building in Finnieston Street, Glasgow and had only seven employees. In 1903 the company moved to new premises in Scotstoun.\n\nIn April 1931, the \"Albion Motor Car Company Ltd\" was renamed \"Albion Motors Limited\". In 1951, Albion was purchased by Leyland Motors, which then became part of the British Leyland Motor Corporation in 1968. Production of the Chieftain, Clydesdale and Reiver trucks and of the Viking bus models continued. In 1969, the company took over the neighbouring Coventry Ordnance Works on South Street, which it used for truck component manufacture. British Leyland eliminated the Albion name in 1972 with the products continuing to be built at the same factory under the Leyland brand. In 1980, vehicle production at the former Albion factory ceased, moving to the British Leyland plant at Bathgate, however component manufacturing continued.\n\nBritish Leyland became Rover Group between 1986 and 1997 the component manufacturing plant became part of Leyland DAF, the newly formed British arm of the Anglo-Dutch company DAF NV, formed by the merger of Rover Group's Leyland Trucks division and the Dutch DAF Trucks company.\n\nFollowing the collapse of DAF in 1993, Leyland DAF went into receivership, and the truck components business in Scotstoun was subject to a management buyout and transferred to a newly created company called \"Albion Automotive\". In 1998, Albion Automotive was acquired by American Axle & Manufacturing Company of Detroit. The new company manufactures axles, driveline systems, chassis systems, crankshafts and chassis components.\n\nIn 1900 the company built its first motor car, a rustic-looking dogcart made of varnished wood, powered by a flat-twin 8hp engine with gear-change by \"Patent Combination Clutches\" and solid tyres.\n\nIn 1903 Albion introduced a 3115 cc 16 hp vertical-twin, followed in 1906 by a 24 hp four. One of the specialities the company offered was solid-tyred shooting-brakes. The last private Albions were powered by a 15 hp monobloc four of 2492 cc.\n\nPassenger car production ceased in 1915 but in 1920 the company announced that estate cars were available again based on a small bus chassis, it is not known if any were actually made.\n\n\nAlthough the manufacture of motor cars was the main industry in the first ten years of its existence, it was decided in 1909 to concentrate on the production of commercial vehicles. During World War I they built for the War Office large quantities of 3 ton trucks powered by a 32 hp engine using chain drive to the rear wheels. After the war many of these were converted for use as charabancs.\n\nTrucks and buses (single and double deckers) were manufactured in the Scotstoun works until 1980 (1972 for complete vehicles). The buses were exported to Asia, East Africa, Australia, India and South Africa. Almost all Albion buses were given names beginning with \"V\", these models being the Victor, Valiant, Viking, Valkyrie, and Venturer.\n\nAlbion also made the Claymore with the 4 speed gearbox, The Reiver was a six wheeler.\nThe Chieftain had a 6 speed gearbox, 6th being an overdrive gear, with a worm and wheel rear axle.\n\nThe earliest buses were built on the A10 truck chassis with two being delivered to West Bromwich in 1914. Newcastle upon Tyne also took double deckers around this time, but Albion did not produce a purpose-built double deck chassis until 1931.\n\nIn 1923 the first dedicated bus chassis was announced derived from the one used on the 25 cwt truck but with better springing. Bodies seating from 12 to 23 passengers were available. A lower frame chassis, the Model 26, with 30/60 hp engine and wheelbases from to joined the range in 1925. All the early vehicles had been normal control, with the engine in front of the driver but in 1927 the first forward control with the engine alongside the driver was announced as the Viking allowing 32 seats to be fitted. Diesel engines, initially from Gardner, were available from 1933. The first double deck design was the Venturer of 1932 with up to 51 seats. The CX version of the chassis was launched in 1937 and on these the engine and gearbox were mounted together rather than joined by a separate drive shaft. Albion's own range of diesel engines was also made available.\n\nAfter World War II, the range was progressively modernised and underfloor engined models were introduced with two prototypes in 1951 and production models from 1955 with the Nimbus.\n\nWith the Leyland take over the range was cut back. The last Albion double decker was the 1961 Lowlander and that was marketed in England as a Leyland, and the last design of all was the Viking, re-using an old name.\n\n\nDuring World War II, Albion Motors manufactured Enfield No 2 Mk I* revolvers to aid the war effort. By 1945, 24,000 Enfield No 2 Mk I* revolvers were produced by Albion (and subsequently, Coventry Gauge & Tool Co.)\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2174951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174951", "title": "Beretta M12", "text": "Beretta M12\n\nThe Beretta Model 12 is a 9×19mm Parabellum caliber submachine gun designed by Beretta. The production started in 1962, the first users were the Italian Carabinieri and the Italian State Police even though in limited number, only in 1978 it was widely issued replacing the old Beretta MAB. In 1962 the Italian Army bought a limited number of Franchi LF57 submachine gun, judged better than the M12 but never issued to the troops, and only in 1992 the M12S2 variant was introduced also if in very limited number. The Italian Air Force, instead, bought many M12S and M12S2 for the airport security units. However the weapon had a higher initial success in the Arab countries and South America. Its debut in combat came during the Tet Offensive in 1968 when the US Marines guarding the U.S. embassy in Saigon repelled the assault by the Viet Cong using the Beretta M12. It is also used by various South American, African and Asian countries, and made under licence in Brazil by Taurus, in Belgium by FN Herstal and in Indonesia by PT Pindad.\n\nIn 1959, Beretta weapons designer Domenico Salza revisited an old project, the Armaguerra Cremona OG44 submachine gun, in order to make a new submachine gun to replace the old MAB model 1938. The Model 12 was the final production model, and was followed ten years later by the M12S with differences in the safety and other mechanics.\n\nThe Model 12 weighs 3.48 kilograms empty (about 3.820 kg loaded) and is 660 millimeters in length with stock extended (418 mm when retracted). Its short length is achieved by use of a barrel recessed into the bolt head, known as a telescoping bolt. This reduces length without reducing barrel length or bolt weight. It fires from an open bolt and has a cyclic rate of fire of 550 rounds per minute.\n\nThe barrel and rifling are chromium-plated to prevent fouling. The bolt housing has grooves to allow bolt movement, even in extremely adverse conditions such as exposure to mud, dust, or sand. The exterior surfaces of the firearm are finished with epoxy resin coating for protection against corrosion and damage.\n\nThe weapon has a selective-fire option allowing a choice of single shot or fully automatic fire.\n\nThe weapon has three safeties: a manual safety which blocks the trigger; an automatic safety on the rear grip which immobilizes the trigger and blocks the bolt in a closed position; and a safety on the cocking handle locking the bolt in case it does not retract sufficiently.\n\nThe weapon is provided with a front sight (adjustable for elevation and windage) and a rear sight with a two-position flip aperture (up to 100 m and up to 200 m).\n\nThe gun is equipped with a side folding stock, but is also seen rarely with a fixed stock.\n\n20-, 32-, and 40-round box magazines were available for the original Model 12, which was chambered for the 9mm Parabellum cartridge.\n\nThe first variant was introduced, in limited number, at the end of the '60s for the Italian Navy special forces and is easily recognizable from the longer barrel, about one inch, and the presence of a birdcage-type flash suppressor. It has been replaced by the Heckler & Koch MP5.\n\nThe Model 12 was redesigned as the Beretta Model 12S in 1978. The Model 12s uses a 32-round box magazine, and is chambered for the 9×19 mm NATO cartridge.\n\nA novel feature is the grip safety, which locks the trigger and the bolt in the closed position, thus safeguarding against accidental firing if the grip is not held firmly or if the gun is dropped. The safety and fire-selector switch, which in the original Model 12 were two separate push-pin button (with the fire-selector being a button that activated single-fire or burst fire whether it was pushed on the right side or the left side) have been re-engineered in a modern lever-type selector with three positions (S for \"Sicura\" or Safety, 1 for Single-fire, R for \"Raffica\" or Burst fire). The fixed firing pin on the face of the bolt can strike the primer only when the cartridge is chambered fully, and this also avoids accidental firing, according to its designers.\n\nThe PM12S was also designed with easy field-stripping and reassembly in mind, which has been simplified and can be accomplished without tools. It can be equipped with a suppressor, but this requires a slight modification of the barrel by a competent gunsmith.\n\nMinus the suppressor and other optional features, the Beretta PM12S is made up of 84 discrete components.\n\nThe current version of the Beretta Model 12, is called the PM12-S2. In the mid-1980s the Italian Carabinieri, after a misfire accident, asked for a modification, in the form of a further safety device, which allowed both to keep the bolt of the weapon in half-cocked position and acted as an interceptor preventing accidental fire should the bolt or the firing pin suddenly disengage. This modification was implemented as a standard factory feature, and the denomination of the submachine gun changed to PM12-S2; this is the only Model 12 variant currently manufactured by Beretta.\n\n\n\n"}

She was destroyed by fire in 1883.\n\nThe ship was long, with a beam of and a depth of . She was powered by a 2-cylinder steam engine having cylinders of diameter by stroke. Rated at 200 nhp, it drove a single screw propeller, giving a speed of . She was assessed at , .\n\n\"Memphis\" was built by William Denny and Brothers, Dumbarton, United Kingdom for Peter Denny and Thomas Begbie. She was launched on April 3, 1862. Her port of registry was London and the United Kingdom Official Number 44836 was allocated.\n\n\"Memphis\" — on her maiden voyage, while running the Union blockade of Confederate ports on June 23, 1862 — ran aground off Sullivan's Island, South Carolina while attempting to enter Charleston harbor. Efficient work by Southern troops got her partially unloaded on the following day, and she was towed to safety by the steamships \"Etiwan\" and \"Marlon\" before Federal warships could hit her with shell fire. They were kept at bay by gunfire from Fort Beauregard. \"Memphis\" was captured by sidewheel gunboat outbound from Charleston with a cargo of cotton on July 31, 1862, and purchased by the Union Navy from a prize court at New York City on September 4, 1862.\n\n\"Memphis\" was commissioned on October 4, 1862, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Pendleton G. Watmough in command. Assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, \"Memphis\" sailed for Charleston and began service on October 14 with the capture of British steamer \"Ouachita\" bound for Havana, Cuba. She continued patrol in 1862–1863. On January 4, 1863, she joined sidewheel steamer in taking Confederate sloop \"Mercury\" with a cargo of turpentine for Nassau, Bahamas. On January 31, Confederate ironclads CSS \"Palmetto State\" and CSS \"Chicora\" made a dash out of Charleston Harbor into the midst of the blockading ships. Screw steamer was rammed and disabled by \"Palmetto State\" while sidewheel steamer was next attacked and left for \"Memphis\" to take in tow. The two rams then retired.\n\nBy March of the following year, \"Memphis\" was operating in the North Edisto River. On March 6, 1864, Confederate torpedo boat CSS \"David\" attempted a run on the Union blockader. The spar torpedo struck \"Memphis\" port quarter but did not explode. After her second torpedo misfired, \"David\" retreated upstream out of range of her foe's heavy guns. \"Memphis\", uninjured, continued her blockading duties to the end of the Civil War.\n\nOn May 6, 1867, \"Memphis\" was decommissioned, and sold to V. Brown & Co., at New York on May 8, 1869. Renamed \"Mississippi\", She was sold to William Weld & Co. of Boston, Massachusetts. She was sold c.1875 to Frederick Baker, Boston. In 1879, she was sold to H. Hastings & Co., Boston. \"Mississippi\" was sold in 1881 to Edward Lawrence, New York. She was sold in 1882 to the Oregon Improvement Co, Portland, Oregon.

{"id": "2174971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174971", "title": "Norway women's national football team", "text": "Norway women's national football team\n\nThe Norway women's national football team is controlled by the Football Association of Norway. The team is former European, World and Olympic champions and thus one of the most successful national teams. The team has had less success since the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\nNorway women's national football team emerged in 1978 for the Nordic Championship tournament, which was relatively early for Western Europe, but late for the Nordic countries, beating only Iceland. Having little culture for official clubs and a series system, Norway had a lot to do to catch up to especially Sweden and Denmark. Their early history therefore consisted of losing to their neighbours and eventually beating Northern Ireland for their first ever win.\n\nEventually, Norway marked themselves as one of the better countries in Europe, if inferior to their Nordic neighbours. They beat England, France and Switzerland. In the first qualification for the European Competition for Representative Women's Teams (later renamed UEFA Women's Championship), Norway played opposite Sweden, Finland and Iceland. Norway lost both matches against Sweden, but beat Finland over both matches. A surprising home draw against Iceland mattered little, Norway took the second spot in a qualification where only the best teams qualified. Sweden later won the Euros.\n\nNorway seemed to have problems with Sweden, and they lost 0–5, their biggest loss to date (if repeated later) shortly afterwards. Compared to other teams, however, Norway improved, and they beat Denmark and West Germany in the qualification for the 1987 Euros. The Euros, consisting as the men's Euros had been until 1980 of two semi finals and a final played in one of the countries qualified for it. In this case, Norway was the host for the four matches. Norway beat Italy in the semifinals and met Sweden in the finals. The finals was the first time Norway beat Sweden in a match, as Norway won 2–1. This made the national football team the first Norwegian sports team ever to have won anything, eleven years ahead of the Norway women's national handball team.\n\nNorway continued to win the next year as they beat Sweden again in a final in an invitational and unofficial world cup in China. In the 1989 Euros Norway made the finals against West Germany, but this time lost 1–4. After that loss the coaches resigned, leaving the helm to Even Pellerud. Pellerud saw Norway progress to the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. Before the first official world cup, Norway made it to the fourth (and Norway's third in a row) final of the Euros, where Norway again met Germany. Germany won in extra time. In the World cup Norway made it to the semifinals, where they lost to the USA.\n\nFollowing that, Pellerud led the team to the 1993 Euros. Norway beat Denmark in the semifinals and Italy in the finals, winning their second Euros. Norway followed up with winning the 1994 Algarve Cup, the first ever to be arranged. The focus the next year was the World Cup and its antecedent Euros, which also functioned as a qualifier for the World Cup. Norway met Italy already in the quarter finals, and won it. Sweden managed to come back and thrash Norway in the second semifinal in Sweden, winning 5–7 after two matches. Norway was still qualified for the World Cup.\n\nThe 1995 World cup in Sweden is part of Norwegian sports heritage. Norway won all their matches in the group stage, and continued to meet an unconvincing Denmark in the quarter finals. Norway was up 3–0 with five minutes to go, and while conceding a goal a minute later, Norway was never threatened. The next encounter for Norway was the US, and in a close match, USA could never respond to an early goal by Ann Kristin Aarønes, and the USA lost their first official international tournament. Norway met Germany in the finals. Having lost two Euro finals, Norway were not among the favourites, but they defeated Germany by two goals scored within the space of four minutes, becoming world champions. Pellerud resigned shortly afterwards.\n\nFrom the first women's football in the Olympic Games, it was considered equal with the world cup in rank. Norway qualified as a matter of course because of their win in the World Cup. Norway drew with Brazil, and beat Germany and Japan, proceeding to the semi finals. There they lost to the US after extra time, but won the bronze medal after defeating Brazil.\n\nThe 1997 Euros turned out to be a big disappointment for the ruling world champions at home, and Norway only made it to the semi finals. This was the last time the two-year gap was used, making it easier to focus on the two competitions separately. Norway eased through to the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, where they beat all their opposition in the group stage. They met Sweden in the quarter finals, proving that now Norway had the upper hand by beating them 3–1. Surprisingly, Norway lost heavily to China, who won 5–0, thus equaling the embarrassment Sweden defeated Norway some 13 years earlier. In the bronze final, Norway lost to Brazil on penalties in front of a record 90,185 spectators.\n\nNorway was not among the biggest favourites to win the Sydney Olympics. They started off losing to the US, but picked up nicely by beating Nigeria and China, the latter by one goal. In the semi finals Norway beat Germany with a lucky own goal by Tina Wunderlich after Germany pressed the Norwegians for the better part of the match. The final saw Norway against heavy favourites USA in an even match. Tiffeny Milbrett took the lead for the US, but Norway equaled the score by Gro Espeseth and stayed in the game with a good keeper in Bente Nordby. Norway took the lead in the match via a header by Ragnhild Gulbrandsen, but Milbrett scored in stoppage time to prolong the match to extra time with golden goal. Norway scored the winner in what seemed like a handball. The coach Per-Mathias Høgmo quit after achieving this feat.\n\nÅge Steen took over as coach, but under his tutelage, things went from top to mediocre. In the 2001 Euros Norway's play was lackluster, and while making it to the semi finals thanks to the French national team, Norway lost clearly to Germany. In the 2003 World Cup Norway disappointed with a fumbling 1–4 to Brazil in the group stage before losing to USA in the quarter finals. As Greece was arranging the 2004 Summer Olympics, there were only two additional spots for European teams, and Sweden and Germany, who had both proceeded to the finals, took them. Steen continued for another year, as stipulated by his contract, but was replaced in late 2004.\n\nUnder the new coach, Bjarne Berntsen, Norway took things up a notch by reaching the final of the 2005 Euros with a classic 3–2 win over Sweden in extra time in the semifinal. Again Germany defeated Norway to win the championship. Norway continued to achieve reasonable results except in the Algarve Cup where the results started to slip.\n\nDespite this Norway qualified for the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup in China. They drew with Australia and narrowly beat Canada, and then a 7–2 win over Ghana took them to the top of their group. Norway then progressed further by beating China 1–0, but lost 0–3 to Germany in the semifinal. In the bronze final Norway lost 1–4 to the US to finish in fourth place in the World Cup, which qualified them to enter the Beijing Olympics. Norway's top scorer Ragnhild Gulbrandsen was awarded the Bronze Boot behind Marta of Brazil and Abby Wambach of the United States.\n\nFrom there Berntsen's fortunes began to wane. First he was criticized for telling Lise Klaveness she had no future in the national team under him, at 1a.m. at Oslo airport as they were arriving back from China, a gross error that he later admitted. Then in the 2008 Olympics Norway first impressively beat USA, then lost to Japan 1–5 and went out in the quarter finals against Brazil. In October 2008, five players refused to play in the National Team, making comments that implied playing under Berntsen was too much of a burden, which led to a media outcry. With a reduced team, and also after some less controversial resignations, Norway produced a relatively good result at the 2009 UEFA Women's Championship by beating Sweden 3–1 in the quarter-finals, even with an embarrassing 0–4 against Germany and a modest 1–0 against Iceland and 1–1 against France. After the championship, Berntsen's contract ended.\n\nEli Landsem, the first woman coach and the first coach with experience of coaching women's football, took over at the end of 2009. Under her some of the players who had previously elected not to play returned. Landsem produced acceptable results and the team qualified to play in the 2011 FIFA World Cup after winning all but one of the matches in their qualification group. However Norway failed to reach the quarter-finals for the first time in its history after losing to Brazil (0–3) and Australia (1–2). As a result, they also failed to qualify for the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe next task was qualification to the 2013 European Cup competition, with Norway in Group3 with Iceland, Northern Ireland, Belgium, Hungary and Bulgaria. The campaign began badly with 3–1 losses to Iceland and 64th-ranked Northern Ireland, but in 2012 the position was recovered with wins in the last six matches, and Norway finished top of Group3 with eight wins from ten matches. They later went on to finish as runners-up in the finals in Sweden.\n\nAt the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, Norway was drawn into a group with Germany, Thailand and the Ivory Coast. Norway performed well in the group stage, as the team beat Thailand 4–0 and the Ivory Coast 3–1. They drew 1–1 against former champions Germany. Norway would lose 2–1 in the round of sixteen to England. England went on to win the bronze medal.\n\nOn 16 December 2016 Martin Sjögren was introduced as the new coach of Norway. He had previous coaching experience in the Damallsvenskan with Linköpings and LdB FC Malmö.\n\nNorway qualified for Euro 2017 without losing a game. They were drawn into Group A alongside the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. Norway was the highest ranked team in Group A, and were predicted by many to win the group.

Krogman\n\nWilton Marion Krogman (June 28, 1903 – November 4, 1987) was an American anthropologist. He was a leader in the development of the field of physical anthropology, with an early and lasting interest in dental anthropology. \n\nOver his long career he also contributed to osteology, racial studies, genetics, medical anthropology, paleoanthropology, constitutional anthropology, and human engineering. His main interests and his most important contributions were in the areas of child growth and development and forensic anthropology.\n\nWilton Krogman, familiarly known as Bill, was the son of Wilhelm Claus Krogman and Lydia Magdalena Wriedt, who were German immigrants living in Oak Park, Illinois. His parents lacked advanced education, but strongly encouraged him to pursue his studies. His father was a skilled craftsman, described as a perfectionist, who worked with his brothers on the first house by Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nKrogman came in first on a standardized test among 490 applicants to the University of Chicago, which he attended as an undergraduate and post-graduate, gaining his Ph.D. in 1928. There he had his first job, as a lecturer in introductory anthropology. The next year he had a fellowship to the Royal College of Surgeons in London. Starting in 1931 he was an associate professor at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, where he interacted with many of the leaders of the profession.\n\nIn 1939 Krogman wrote an article in the F.B.I. newsletter entitled \"A Guide to the Identification of Human Skeletal Material\". It is widely considered to mark the beginning of forensic anthropology in the United States. Over the years Professor Krogman came to be popularly known as \"the bone doctor\", examining such famous cases as two boy's skeletons found in the Tower of London.\n\nIn 1939 he returned to the faculty of the University of Chicago, as associate professor of both anatomy and physical anthropology, teaching graduate students for the first time.\n\nThen in 1947 Krogman was called to be professor of physical anthropology in both the Graduate School of Medicine and the School of Dental Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. A package deal gave him an ex officio appointment in the university's Department of Anthropology and as a curator in the university museum. He was also put on the staff of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The multifaceted positions helped him realize his wide-ranging research goals.\n\nAfter becoming professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania in 1971, he moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to become director of research at the H. K. Cooper Clinic, which worked on cleft palates, finally stepping down from active service there in 1983.\n\nKrogman was the author of a number of books. One he liked was \"The Growth of Man\" (1941), and one of his most widely known was \"Child Growth\" (1972). But without doubt his most famous and influential book was \"The Human Skeleton in Forensic Medicine\" (1962) (updated in 1986), long the definitive work on the topic. He also wrote numerous articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\nHe was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1966.\n\nHe was first married to Virginia Madge Lane. They had a daughter, Marian Krogman Baur, and a son, William L. Krogman. In 1945, he married Mary Helen Winkley and they had two sons, John Winkley Krogman and Mark Austin Krogman.\n\nHis definitive biography is by William A. Haviland, a longtime colleague and friend. It was published by the National Academy of Sciences in 1994.\n\n"}

It is the third verse of the Sermon on the Mount, and also the third of what are known as the Beatitudes.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 5:5.\n\nThis well known verse is perhaps the most famous of the Beatitudes. Unlike the previous two, however, this one has no parallel in Luke's Sermon on the Plain. Luke's Sermon contains four Beatitudes and four Woes. There is considerable debate over whether this Beatitude was in Q, and Luke left it out, or if it is an original addition by the author of Matthew. Gundry's theory is that the author of Matthew wanted to remove the woes for later use against the Pharisees in Matthew 23, however he wanted to keep the same eightfold structure and thus needed to create four new sayings. He sees this verse as essentially just a rephrasing of ; this same wording is also found at . Meek and poor, which can also be translated as humble or modest, mean essentially the same thing. Schweizer feels \"meek\" should be understood as meaning \"powerless\".\n\nThe 19th century theologian James Strong argued in his \"Strong's Concordance\" #4239 that the Greek word \"praus\" (πραεῖς) means mild or gentle, but it is not suggesting weakness but instead the way power is handled. It is \"strength under control\". It is demonstrating power without undue harshness. The English language does not have a word that translates conveying both gentleness and power together. But perhaps the word \"mercy\" or \"merciful\" comes close to describing the exercise of power that is \"strength under control\".\n\nThe phrase \"inherit the earth\" is also similar to \"theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven\" in . Schweizer notes that two terms reflect the two different views of the end times current when Matthew was writing. One view was that the end of the world would see all the believers brought up to join the Kingdom of Heaven. The other view was that the end times would have God come down to directly rule Earth, and the chosen people would then be given dominion over the entire world. Hill does not see the two verses referring to different things. He does not feel that word \"earth\" means the physical world. Rather he notes that and both use the word inherit to refer to the Israelites taking possession of the Holy Land. Hill feels that \"earth\", which can also be translated as \"land\", is an allusion to the new Holy Land, which might not be on Earth. A refined meaning of this phrase has been seen to say that those that are quiet or nullified will one day inherit the world.\n\n\"Meek\" in the Greek literature of the period most often meant \"gentle\" or \"soft\". Nolland writes that a more accurate interpretation for this verse is \"powerless\". Clarke notes how important and revolutionary this elevation of meekness was in the Mediterranean's societies of the time that placed enormous stock in honour and status. This verse has been much praised, even by some non-Christians such as Mahatma Gandhi. Some have seen it less favourably. Baron d'Holbach felt that this verse, and those around it, reflected the interests of Christians when they were a small and powerless sect. He felt that whenever Christians gained power these views were inevitably abandoned. Friedrich Nietzsche was harshly critical over this verse, which to him embodied the \"slave morality\" of Jesus. It has also been criticized by James Joyce, William Blake, and Theodore Dreiser who all rejected a life without striving.\n\nOther writers have pointed out that the Greek word \"praus\" (πραεῖς) was used to define a horse trained for battle. Wild stallions were brought down from the mountains and broken for riding. Some were used to pull wagons, some were raced, and the best were trained for warfare. They retained their fierce spirit, courage, and power, but were disciplined to respond to the slightest nudge or pressure of the rider’s leg. They could gallop into battle at 35 miles per hour and come to a sliding stop at a word. They were not frightened by arrows, spears, or torches. Then they were said to be meeked.\n\nTo be meeked was to be taken from a state of wild rebellion and made completely loyal to, and dependent upon, one’s master. It is also to be taken from an atmosphere of fearfulness and made unflinching in the presence of danger. Some war horses dove from ravines into rivers in pursuit of their quarry. Some charged into the face of exploding cannons as Lord Tennyson expressed in his poem, “The Charge of the Light Brigade.” These stallions became submissive, but certainly not spineless. They embodied power under control, strength with forbearance.\n\nAs one of the most famous of Beatitudes, \"the meek shall inherit the earth\" has appeared many times in works of art and popular culture:\n\n\n"}

It was recorded by Cyndi Lauper for her debut album, \"She's So Unusual\" and was released as a single in 1984, peaking at number 27 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song is about how money interferes with personal relationships.\n\nThe original single was released in 1978 by the Brains as a 45 rpm single on Gray Matter Records.

Investcorp bought a majority of the Dainese Group in 2014. The company has been led by CEO Cristiano Silei since 2015 \n\nDainese Group helmets are branded AGV, while the suits, jackets, shock-absorbing armor and back protectors, pants, boots, gloves and accessories are branded Dainese. These products are made with materials including traditional cowhide, kangaroo skin, aramid, carbon fiber and titanium, and are sold off-the-rack, made-to-measure, or custom made. In 2017 Dainese added the motorcycling fashion clothing brand Settantadue (\"seventy-two\" in Italian).\n\nDainese has diversified its product range over the years to cover mountain biking, skiing and horse riding, often using the technologies developed for motorcycle racing.\n\nLino Dainese started the company in 1972 when he was 20, making protective motorcycle apparel in Molvena, Vicenza, Italy. The first article of clothing was a pair of motocross pants. The company has been closely associated with motorcycle racing since its foundation, which has informed its product development, focused on safety, performance and ergonomics. \n\nThe company acquired the Italian helmet manufacturer AGV in July 2007.\n\nThe Dainese Group was acquired by Investcorp of Bahrain for €130 million in 2014.

In December 2016, \"Billboard\" named her the 95th most successful dance artist of all time. According to the \"Independent\", Holloway had \"undoubtedly the most sampled female voice in popular music\", used in house and dance tracks such as the hit 1989 single \"Ride on Time\".\n\nHolloway began singing gospel with her mother in the Holloway Community Singers in Chicago and recorded with Albertina Walker in the Caravans gospel group between 1967 and 1971. Holloway was also a cast member of the Chicago troupe of \"Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope\". Around this time, she met her future producer, manager, and husband Floyd Smith, and recorded \"Rainbow ’71\" in 1971, a Curtis Mayfield song that Gene Chandler had recorded in 1963. It was initially released on the Apache label, but was picked up for national distribution by Galaxy Records.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Holloway signed a recording contract with the Atlanta-based soul music label Aware, part of the General Recording Corporation (GRC), owned by Michael Thevis. Holloway recorded two albums for the label, both of them produced by Floyd Smith — \"Loleatta\" (1973) and \"Cry to Me\" (1975). Her first single from the second album, the ballad, \"Cry to Me\" rose to #10 Billboard R&B and #68 on the Hot 100, but before the label could really establish Holloway, it went out of business.\n\nTop Philadelphia arranger and producer Norman Harris signed Holloway in 1976 for his new label, Gold Mind, a subsidiary of New York's Salsoul Records. The first release from the album \"Loleatta\" was another Sam Dees ballad, \"Worn Out Broken Heart,\" which reached #25 R&B, but the B-side, \"Dreaming,\" climbed to #72 on the pop chart and launched her as a disco act.\n\nShe contributed vocals to \"Re-Light My Fire\" for Dan Hartman, who then wrote and produced the title track of her fourth and final album for Gold Mind, \"Love Sensation\" (1980). 18 of her songs charted on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, including four #1s. However, it was a ballad that proved to be another big R&B hit for her. \"Only You\" was written and produced by Bunny Sigler, who also sang with Holloway on the track, and it reached #11 in 1978.\n\nIn the early 1980s, she had another dance hit with \"Crash Goes Love\" (#5 on the U.S. Dance chart, #86 on the US R&B Chart). She also recorded one single, \"So Sweet,\" for the fledgling house-music label DJ International Records. In the late 1980s, her vocals from \"Love Sensation\" were used in the UK #1 hit \"Ride on Time\" by Black Box. Holloway, however, was uncredited for her vocals and Holloway successfully sued the group, which led to an undisclosed court settlement in Holloway's favor.\n\nIn 1992, she also had a hit with dance band Cappella. There, she appeared billed as Cappella featuring Loleatta Holloway on the single \"Take Me Away\" (UK #25). Holloway's fortunes dramatically improved, however, when she had her first US #1 hit when Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch featured her vocals in the chart-topping \"Good Vibrations\" (1991). According to Andrew Barker in \"Variety\" (March 22, 2011), Holloway also performed with Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch to promote the single and she received full vocal credit as well as a share of the royalties. This was shortly after the backlash against various acts such as Milli Vanilli and the groups that used the vocals of Martha Wash, but refused to give her credit until she sued.\n\nMore recent dance chart entries included \"Share My Joy\" (Credited to \"GTS Featuring Loleatta Holloway\"), \"What Goes Around Comes Around\" (credited to \"GTS Featuring Loleatta Holloway\") in 2000, and \"Relight My Fire\" (credited to \"Martin featuring Holloway\"), which hit #5 in 2003. Whilst not a single, \"Like a Prayer\", a Madonna cover, was a track on the Madonna tribute album \"Virgin Voices\". The song \"Love Sensation '06\" and reached #37 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nHolloway died aged 64 on March 21, 2011 from heart failure and is survived by her four children.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most of his paintings were of the West Penwith peninsula and Tresco in the Isles of Scilly.\n\nDuring the 1970s John Miller emerged as a cultural figurehead within Cornwall. He became well known as a painter of popular, Monet-like Cornish scenes (many of which were cheaply reproduced as prints for the tourist trade), as an art teacher, a television personality, a patron of local charities and an active supporter of the Church of England. He was also responsible for some high-profile architectural projects including a reordering of the interior of Newlyn Art Gallery.\n\nAt an advanced stage in his career John Miller’s artistic style underwent a radical change and by the mid-1990s his work (but not always his name) had become known worldwide as a result of the mass production and distribution of cheap posters, prints and cards with reproductions of his distinctive beach paintings: he produced the first of these in what was to become recognised as his trademark style in 1992. The beach scenes had enormous market appeal and have become firmly established as iconic images which - now much imitated - apparently spawned a genre. The paintings themselves, which Miller continued to produce in large numbers until his death in 2002, became highly sought after and were only available through selected London galleries at successive annual exhibitions which usually sold out well before their official opening dates.\n\nJohn Miller was elected to become a member of the Newlyn Society of Artists in 1961.

Her father was a one-man band, and her grandmother, Louella Reed, was a singer on the Chitlin Circuit. In 1947 her family relocated to Chicago. While growing up on Chicago's south side Hunt discovered her musical talent. Living in that part of Chicago was not easy; recalls Geraldine. \"On the weekends, we had to sleep on the floor, gangs were shooting through the house; I had been beaten up at gunpoint once, It was rough. We were living below middle class.\"\n\nDespite the bleak living conditions of her childhood, there were bright spots also. A notable time in her life was her years at Hyde Park High School. Her classmate and best friend at school was the late American soul singer-songwriter Minnie Riperton. Besides Hunt and Riperton, the school also produced a girl group called Coffee who covered Ruby Andrews' \"Casanova\" in 1980.\n\nHunt began her recording career as a teenager with several singles released from 1962: she had her first glimmer of success in 1970 when \"You & I\" a duet with Charlie Hodges reached #45 on the R&B chart in \"Billboard\" and in 1972 Hunt's remake of \"Baby I Need Your Loving\" reached #47 R&B.\n\nIn 1975 Hunt relocated to Montreal, Quebec where she recorded her first album in 1978, the disco-oriented \"Sweet Honesty\". In 1980 Hunt's second album \"No Way\" yielded the track \"Can't Fake the Feeling\" which reached #1 on the club chart in \"Billboard\" where it spent a total of seven weeks: with Top 40 radio then being disco-resistant \"Can't Fake the Feeling\" had little mainstream success reaching #58 R&B. However the track did afford Hunt a hit in France at #10 and charted in the UK at #44.\n\nIn 1982 she helped write and produce some of the music for Chéri.\n\nHunt is the mother of three children; Rosalind Hunt of the musical group Chéri, singer Freddie James and writer Jeanne (Dupuis) Croteau. \n\n"}

The plot concerns a gay man named David who leaves a monastery to become a public school teacher by day, while looking for true love in a gay bar by night.\n\nOne of the first films about gay relationships intended for mainstream, commercial distribution, its original title was \"For as Long as Possible\". It was released to lukewarm reviews in 1973 and given an \"R\" rating by the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\nThe film begins as a mini-documentary of New York City's 1973 Gay Pride parade and rally, with a young lesbian unabashedly declaring, \"being gay is a very natural thing.\" The action cuts to the protagonist, David (Robert Joel), going through the ritual of being released from his vocation as a monk in a monastery. He then is seen as a public school teacher of English Literature in the New York City area, who spends his time off driving into the city to be with his \"oldest friend from Schenectady,\" Alan (Jay Pierce) at a gay bar. One evening at the bar, David is singled out to dance by Mark (Curt Gareth), who portrays a businessman. They end up spending the night together, which at first seems like a one-night stand until David says he'd like to see Mark again, and Mark agrees. Not long after, the pair begin a monogamous relationship, and David moves in with Mark. But when Mark wants to have sex with other men, the relationship starts to break down. He rejects the idea of modeling a gay relationship on heterosexual marriage, and he is irritated that David wants to \"keep pushing this romantic thing.\" Mark would rather have an understanding that either of them can have sex with other men when they feel like it, but this ends up alienating them from each other. Mark refuses to say, \"I love you\" until David playfully wrestles with him and tells him, \"Say it...again...once more for good measure.\" After a year, though, David realizes that the two of them are just marking time. The two go to Fire Island for a weekend in an attempt to spice up their relationship, and although David tries to please Mark by entering an orgy, he can't go through with it. After a fight, David temporarily moves in with his friend Alan, who gives David an objective perspective on what happened. In a later encounter with Mark at Coney Island, David finally realizes that there can't be a reconciliation, as Mark is more interested in sex than a romantic relationship.\n\nAfter a season of loneliness, David meets a divorced photographer named Jason (Bo White) at the 1973 Gay Pride rally which began the film. David and Jason go to Jason's apartment and talk. In Jason, a divorced dad, we meet another member of the gay community, one who was living a heterosexual life prior to coming out. He still socializes with his ex-wife, who goes with him on photo shoots. On a parental visit with their toddler son (P.J.) Jason tells his ex-wife that he is now seeing someone with whom he would be spending the upcoming Labor Day holiday. It appears that in Jason, David has found someone willing to pursue a romantic, committed relationship with him. Jason takes pictures of David while telling him things to say other than \"cheese', and the film ends by showing the two men together splashing naked in the surf on Cape Cod.\n\n\n\"A Very Natural Thing\" was seen as the gay response to \"Love Story\" (1970), the film famous for the phrase, \"Love means never having to say you're sorry.\" Similarly, Mark tells David, \"Love means never having to say you're in love,\" and a montage of the two men rolling down a leaf-covered hill, quietly lying together at home, and being in love mimics a montage of the heterosexual couple in \"Love Story\". Both films argued for an unconventional alternative to traditional marriage, despite a commitment. David tells Jason that he is committed to him, but that this commitment is based on wanting to be together, not \"having\" to be together. The ending is very optimistic, which was out of the ordinary for gay relationship films until then. Earlier films were dominated by tales of gays and lesbians being outcasts of society, mentally disturbed or committing suicide; later films were sadly dominated by the emergence of AIDS.\" A Very Natural Thing\" thus represents a short period in time where gay liberation flourished, and filmmakers could explore relationships in much the same way that films with heterosexual characters did.\n\nThe film was one of the first mainstream films to show homosexuality as a valid and normal act of love, i.e. \"a very natural thing,\" as it attempted to explore the options for gay couples in 1973, including footage of an actual Gay Pride celebration. Many heterosexual film critics felt that the film's depiction of love between two men as romantic made the film automatically \"an argument rather than an entertainment\" (\"The New York Post\"). The film showed a young gay couple going through many of the same rituals and facing many of the same challenges as a straight couple.\n\nSome gay film critics felt that film was not political enough: that the characters were too apolitical, too middle class and that, by rejecting the philosophy of free love or sexual liberation, the film was rejecting what some gay activists felt was a necessary value of the new gay liberation movement.\n\nLarkin responded to the criticism by saying, \"I wanted to say that same-sex relationships are no more problematic but no easier than any other human relationships. They are in many ways the same and in several ways different from heterosexual relationships but in themselves are no less possible or worthwhile\". Incidentally, Vito Russo, who wrote \"The Celluloid Closet\" appears in \"A Very Natural Thing.\"\n\nThe film was not financially successful, and the director, Christopher Larkin, moved to California, where in 1981 he published the book \"The Divine Androgyne According to Purusha\". Larkin committed suicide on June 21, 1988.\n\nThe film was released in VHS in 1996, it has recently been released on DVD: a 25th Anniversary edition in 1999 by Waterbearer Films, Inc.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2175062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175062", "title": "Doctor Septimus Pretorius", "text": "Doctor Septimus Pretorius\n\nSeptimus Pretorius is a fictional character who appears in the Universal film \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935). He is played by British stage and film actor Ernest Thesiger. Some sources claim he was originally to have been played by Bela Lugosi or Claude Rains. Others indicate that the part was conceived specifically for Thesiger.\n\nDoctor Pretorius is a renegade mad scientist who persuades Henry Frankenstein to resume his experiments with bringing dead flesh to life. An amoral egomaniac, he has no regard for human life or ethics and cares only for his own prestige as a scientist.\n\nAlong with his sinister qualities, Pretorius is responsible for a large share of the film's dark humor. He eats a picnic dinner in a crypt, trades prissy banter with the Monster, and laments that the tiny ballerina he created \"will only dance to Mendelssohn's 'Spring Song.'\" He claims that gin is his only weakness. Then later in the film, he claims his cigars are his only weakness when he first meets the Monster. Pretorius also delivers the famous toast \"To a new world of gods and monsters!\" midway through the film.\n\nFrankenstein's former teacher Septimus Pretorius is a tall, emaciated-looking man with an unusually large nose and devilish pointed ears. A professor of philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt, Pretorius first points young Henry on the path toward his unwholesome experiments in giving life to the dead. He himself is \"booted out\" from his teaching post \"for knowing too much.\" Pretorius seeks out his former student after learning that the Monster has survived being trapped in the burning windmill in the climax of the first film. Pretorius himself acknowledges that he may be insane in a conversation with Frankenstein by quoting \"You think I'm mad? Perhaps I am!\"\n\nPretorius performs experiments creating life similar to Henry's. He unveils to Henry a group of various homunculi—miniature living humans which he has kept in bottles and claims to have grown from \"seed\" like cultures. Each figure represents a different character:\n\n\nHe has been unsuccessful in creating a full-sized human. He proposes to Henry that together they create a mate for his monster with Henry building the body and Pretorius supplying an artificially-grown brain. Henry initially balks at the idea, but Pretorius reminds him that he is capable of exposing him to the authorities as the creator of the Monster who has done so much damage.\n\nLater, he meets the Monster in a crypt where he has gone to steal bodies and is dining using the top of a coffin as a picnic table. When the Monster asks him \"Friend?,\" he gives him the remains of his chicken. He tells the Monster of his plans to create a mate for him. \n\nThe Monster, eager for companionship of any kind, considers Pretorius his friend. From then on, the Monster is willing to do anything that the impish scientist desires such as kidnapping Henry's wife Elizabeth in order to force him to help Pretorius. Henry agrees and together the two scientists create the Bride of Frankenstein. Unfortunately, even the Bride finds her would-be husband repulsive and the heartbroken Monster decides to end his life by blowing up the laboratory. He instructs Henry and Elizabeth to run, but barks at Pretorius and the Bride to stay saying that they \"belong dead\". Before Pretorius can move, the Monster blows up the laboratory and the castle. Frankenstein and Elizabeth escape, but Pretorius's fate is not revealed.\n\nThe Monster, however, returned in the next sequel.\n\nDr. Pretorius is frequently identified as homosexual, or as near to homosexual as could be presented on-screen in 1935. (There is, of course, no direct reference to homosexuality in the film.) \"Bride of Frankenstein\" director James Whale was openly gay and frequently included camp elements in his films. He directed Thesiger (himself identified in some sources as more or less openly gay) to play the part as an \"over the top caricature of a bitchy and aging homosexual\". Gay film historian Vito Russo stops short of identifying Pretorius as gay, calling him instead \"sissified\" (\"sissy\" itself being Hollywood code for \"homosexual\"). Pretorius serves as a figure of seduction and temptation, pulling Frankenstein away from his bride on their wedding night to engage in the unnatural act of non-procreative life. The Breen Office, responsible for enforcing Hollywood's Production Code, let Pretorius' behavior pass unchallenged. A novelisation of the film published in England made the implication even more clear, having Pretorius say to Frankenstein, \"'Be fruitful and multiply.' Let us obey the Biblical injunction: you of course, have the choice of natural means; but as for me, I am afraid that there is no course open to me but the scientific way.\"\n\nPretorius appears in \"\" as the primary and recurring antagonist of the series' titular character, Stanley Ipkiss / The Mask, depicted as a mad scientist who had his own head removed from his body and placed on tiny, spider-like robotic legs, which could attach to a larger android body.\n\nPretorius appears in Kim Newman's crossover novel \"Dracula Cha Cha Cha\", as a colleague of H. P. Lovecraft's Herbert West. He appears as one of the horror movie spoofs in \"Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter\" and also appears in Allan Rune Pettersson's novel \"Frankenstein's Aunt Returns\".\n\nIn the Amicus horror film \"The House That Dripped Blood\" (1970), Geoffrey Bayldon, playing a mysterious antique shop owner, is made up and costumed to look like Ernest Thesiger as Pretorius.\n\nIn the 1973 NBC-TV miniseries \"\", James Mason portrays a Pretorius-like figure named Dr. Polidori (named for Lord Byron's real-life physician, John William Polidori, who was part of the 1816 gathering that produced Mary Shelley's novel and also the author of the story \"The Vampyre\"). Mason's Dr. Polidori enlists Victor to assist in creating the female creature Prima (portrayed by Jane Seymour).\n\nThe 1986 film \"From Beyond\" adds a Dr. Edward Pretorius at Miskatonic University (played by Ted Sorel) as a dark mentor for Crawford Tillinghast (Jeffrey Combs). This Pretorius is an impotent sadist (with a room full of bondage gear) who is assimilated by \"the Beyond\" and attempts to drag others into it, boasting that the pineal gland growth brought on by the resonator is like \"an orgasm of the mind\".\n\nThe 1989 Akif Pirinçci novel \"Felidae\" and its 1994 animated feature film adaptation feature an insane Professor Preterius in the backstory performing increasingly dark experiments on the cat Claudandus.\n\nIn the 1998 independent film \"Gods and Monsters\", directed by Bill Condon, Ernest Thesiger as Pretorius is played by Arthur Dignam in a flashback about the filming of \"Bride of Frankenstein\". An earlier scene shows Whale's gardener Clayton Boon (portrayed by Brendan Fraser) watching \"Bride of Frankenstein\" on television, specifically the climatic scene of Pretorius and Frankenstein unveiling the Bride.\n\nIn the 2007 \"Frankenstein\" TV movie, the character of Professor Jane Pretorius is based on Septimus Pretorius and served as Victoria Frankenstein's boss.\n\nIn the Dark Horse \"Universal's Monsters\" novel, \"The Bride Of Frankenstein: Pandora's Bride\", Pretorius somehow survives the destruction of the tower lab along with the Bride. They escape to Germany where he teaches her to become her own woman.\n\nIn \"Mary Shelley's Frankenhole\", the character Professor Sanguinaire Polidori (voiced by Scott Adsit) is based on Septimus Pretorius.\n"}
{"id": "2175063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175063", "title": "Hardware (film)", "text": "Hardware (film)\n\nHardware is a 1990 British science fiction horror film starring Dylan McDermott and Stacey Travis. The film, which was written and directed by Richard Stanley, also features cameos from Carl McCoy, Iggy Pop and Lemmy. Since its release, it has become a cult film. The film is about a self-repairing robot that goes on a rampage in a post-apocalyptic slum. Fleetway Comics successfully sued the film-makers over the screenplay because it plagiarised a short story entitled \"SHOK!\" that appeared in 1980 in the Judge Dredd Annual 1981, a spin-off publication of the popular British weekly anthology comic 2000 AD.\"\n\nA nomad scavenger treks through an irradiated wasteland and discovers a buried robot. He collects the pieces and takes them to junk dealer Alvy, who is talking with 'Hard Mo' Baxter, a former soldier, and Mo's friend Shades. When Alvy steps away, Mo buys the robot parts from the nomad and sells all but the head to Alvy. Intrigued by the technology, Alvy begins to research its background. Mo and Shades visit Jill, Mo's reclusive girlfriend, and, after an initially distant welcome where Jill checks them with a Geiger counter, Mo presents the robot head as a Christmas gift. Jill, a metal sculptor, eagerly accepts the head. After Shades leaves, they have sex, while being unknowingly watched by their foul-mouthed, perverted, voyeuristic neighbor Lincoln Weinberg via telescope.\n\nLater, Mo and Jill argue about a government sterilization plan and the morality of having children. Jill works the robot head into a sculpture, and Mo says that he likes the work, but he does not understand what it represents. Frustrated, Jill says it represents nothing and resents Mo's suggestion that she make more commercial art to sell. They are interrupted by Alvy, who urges Mo to return to the shop, as he has important news about the robot, which he says is a M.A.R.K. 13. Before he leaves, Mo checks his Bible, where he finds the phrase \"No flesh shall be spared\" under Mark 13:20, and he becomes suspicious that the robot is part of a government plot for human genocide to address the planet's severe overpopulation crisis. Mo finds Alvy dead of a cytotoxin and evidence that the robot is an experimental combat model capable of self-repair; Alvy's notes also indicate a defect, a weakness to humidity. Worried, Mo contacts Shades and asks him to check on Jill, but Shades is in the middle of a drug trip and barely coherent.\n\nBack at the apartment, the robot has reassembled itself using pieces of Jill's metal sculptures and recharged by draining her apartment's power network. It attempts to kill Jill, but she traps it in a room after the apartment's doors lock. Lincoln sees the robot close the blinds while trying to peep on Jill, and, after he briefly manages to open the apartment door, makes crude sexual advances towards her, and offers to override the emergency lock that traps them in her apartment. Lincoln dismisses her warnings of a killer robot, and, when he attempts to open Jill's blinds so that he can more easily peep on her, the M.A.R.K. 13 brutally kills him. Jill flees into her kitchen, where she reasons that her refrigerator will hide her from the robot's infrared vision. She damages the robot before Mo, Shades, and the apartment's security team arrive and open fire on it, apparently destroying it.\n\nAs Jill and Mo embrace, the M.A.R.K. 13 drags her out a window, and she crashes into her neighbor's apartment. Jill races back upstairs to help Mo, who is alone with the M.A.R.K. 13. Overconfident, Mo engages the robot in battle, and it injects him with the same toxin that killed Alvy. Mo experiences euphoria and a series of hallucinations as he dies. After Jill reenters her apartment, the M.A.R.K. 13 sets her apartment doors to rapidly open and close; the security team die when they attempt to enter, and Shades is trapped outside. Jill hacks into the M.A.R.K. 13's CPU and unsuccessfully attempts to communicate with it; however, she discovers the robot's weakness and lures the M.A.R.K. 13 into the bathroom. Shades, who has managed to quickly jump through the doors, gives her time to turn on the shower. The M.A.R.K. 13 short circuits and is finally deactivated. The next morning, a radio broadcast announces that the M.A.R.K. 13 has been approved by the government, and it will be mass manufactured.\n\n\nThe film's script was similar to a short \"2000 AD\" comic strip called \"SHOK!\" which had been published in 1980. Fleetway Comics brought a successful lawsuit that the film plagiarized the comic strip and so a notice was added to later releases, giving credits to the strip's publisher, Fleetway Publications and creators, Steve MacManus and Kevin O'Neill. Other influences include \"Soylent Green\", \"Damnation Alley\", and the works of Philip K. Dick.\n\nWriter-director Richard Stanley had previously made a post-apocalyptic short film when he was a teenager, and \"Hardware\" grew out of that film and responses he got from other, unproduced scripts. By the late 1980s, Stanley had joined a guerrilla Muslim faction in the Soviet–Afghan War in order to shoot a documentary. He started pre-production of \"Hardware\" almost immediately after leaving Afghanistan.\n\nThe opening scene was shot in Morocco, and the rest of the film was shot in east London. The film was originally more specifically British, but Miramax insisted on American leads. Stanley then added a multinational cast to muddy the setting.\n\nStanley wanted to emphasize themes of fascism and passive acceptance of authoritarianism, as he had recently come from the apartheid regime of South Africa. Stanley says that the robot does not know that it is committing evil, and it only obeys its programming, which could be likened to a spiritual quest. Psychic TV was an inspiration for the exaggerated television broadcasts.\n\n\"Hardware\" was originally rated \"X\" by the MPAA for its gore. It was later cut to avoid the stigma of a rating associated with pornography. In the United States, the film debuted at number six. It grossed $2,381,285 in its opening weekend and had a total domestic gross of $5,728,953 in 695 theaters.\n\nDue to its unexpected success, the film was caught up in continual legal issues that prevented its release on DVD for many years.\n\"Hardware\" was released on Region 2 DVD and Blu-ray Disc on 22 June 2009. It was released on Region 1 DVD and Blu-ray Disc on 13 October 2009 by Severin Films.\n\nRotten Tomatoes shows that the film received positive reviews from 50% of 12 surveyed critics; the average rating was 5.7/10. On its original release, \"Hardware\" received mixed reviews from critics, who cited it as derivative of \"Alien\" and \"The Terminator\". Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" rated the film D+ and called it unoriginal, \"as if someone had remade \"Alien\" with the monster played by a rusty erector set.\" \"Variety\" wrote, \"A cacophonic, nightmarish variation on the postapocalyptic cautionary genre, \"Hardware\" has the makings of a punk cult film.\" Michael Wilmington of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it a shallow splatter film whose exaggerated bleakness elevates it above the typical techno-thriller. Hardware has the \"inherent blemishes of the techno-thriller genre\", its bringing life in post-industrialism to the level of drones, and exaggerated high-tech bloodbaths. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" described it as a future midnight movie and wrote, \"Watching \"Hardware\" is like being trapped inside a video game that talks dirty.\" Richard Harrington of \"The Washington Post\" called it \"an MTV movie, a mad rush of hyperkinetic style and futuristic imagery with little concern for plot (much less substance).\"\n\nDespite mixed reviews during original release, \"Hardware\" managed to become a cult film. Ian Berriman of \"SFX\" wrote, \"It's one of those lovingly crafted movies where ingenuity and enthusiasm overcome the budgetary limitations.\" Matt Serafini of Dread Central rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \"\"Hardware\" isn't \"quite\" the masterpiece that some its most ardent fans have claimed, but it's an excellent piece of low-budget filmmaking from an era when low-budget wasn't synonymous with camcorder crap.\" Bloody Disgusting rated it 3.5/5 stars and called it \"an austere and trippy film\" with a narrative that is \"a disjointed mess\"; however, the film's excesses make it a cult film. Todd Brown of Twitch Film called it \"essentially a lower budget, more intentionally punk take on \"The Terminator\"\" that has an \"undeniable ... sense of style\". At DVD Verdict, Daryl Loomis called it slow-paced but stylistic and atmospheric, and Gordon Sullivan called it \"a hallucinatory and violent film\" that has an overly detailed, slow-paced beginning. Writing for DVD Talk, Kurt Dahlke rated it 3/5 stars and called it a \"forgotten gem\" that \"is overwhelmed by style and gore\", and Brian Orndorf called it \"an art-house, sci-fi gorefest\" that is moody and atmospheric without buckling under its own weight. Michael Gingold of \"Fangoria\" rated it 3/4 stars and wrote, \"If the ingredients of HARDWARE are familiar, Stanley cooks them to a boil with a relentless pace and imagery that makes his future a tactile place\".\n\nIn a 2011 episode of the television series \"The Office\" titled \"The Seminar\", Gabe offers to watch this film with his girlfriend, Erin, as a compromise when she tells him she wants to watch \"Wall-E\".\n\n"}

Although the specifics of the stance vary by style, overall it is visually similar to a lunge, with the forward leg bent at the knee, and the rear leg straight, while the hips and shoulders remain squarely facing forward. The purpose of the stance is to teach musculo-skeletal alignment that adds as much mass of the earth to a strike as possible. The stance allows a great deal of power generation forward, but very little in any other direction.\n\nIn Japanese martial arts, the is primarily practiced in karate and its variants. Some variations include the version practiced by Shotokan, where students generally place their feet at a longer depth, while Isshin-ryū students place their feet shoulder width, but with much shallower length. Other variations are also practiced.\n\nThe purpose of the front stance is to provide stability while projecting the body weight forwards, such as when punching. The straight rear leg pushes the center of gravity forwards, ensuring the full body weight is behind the strike, while the bent front leg supports the body weight. The front stance can be used when moving forwards or backwards, as long as the body weight or center of gravity is projected forwards. The back stance is by contrast used when the body weight or center of gravity is positioned on the rear leg, such as when leaning backwards to avoid an attack.\n\nThe front stance is primarily practiced by students of taekwondo, where it is called ap kubi.\n\nStudents of Tang Soo Do or Kong Soo Do call this stance chun gul chase. Depending on the school's lineage, it will either be very similar to a Shotokan deep and long stance (Most Moo Duk Kwan or Chung Do Kwan lineage schools), or else appear more similar to a Shudokan or Renbukai stance, which is of shorter length (Most Jido Kwan, Han Moo Kwan or Chang Moo Kwan schools).\n"}

The game was developed by Electronic Arts, Design and Programming led by Brent Iverson, also known for the PC DOS version of Chuck Yeager's Air Combat, and US Navy Fighters.\n\nThe game was originally released for PC DOS, thereafter ports were made for other platforms, such as the Mega Drive/Genesis.\n\nIn addition to the titular LHX prototype scout-attack helicopter, the game features two flyable US Army helicopters, the AH-64A Apache and UH-60 Blackhawk, and another prototype (as of 1990): the MV-22 Osprey, any of which may be deployed against Soviet-made ground and air military equipment in the three war theaters of Libya, Vietnam and Germany. Allied units are also available, but they do not actively join the fight, nor do the opposing units usually fire upon allied equipment, apart from specific escort missions where a B-2 bomber or a couple of UH-60 tasked with CSAR will enter into enemy air space. All missile-equipped units (both ground and air) have a limited number of shots, often matching the number of ready-to-fire missiles available in the real system. Land units do not move but air units do.\nThe player can play any campaign or mission in any preferred order, facing five different complexity levels, which will improve the enemy's situation awareness, time of reaction and sheer number and quality of the fielded forces. Every completed mission will not affect the other missions or the campaign as a whole and the player can run the same mission again regardless its previous result. At the end of every mission, the player receives a mission debriefing describing the consequences of the success or failure and a point counter will change depending whether the primary target is completed, whether the pilot landed at an allied airfield and not just in friendly territory and to a smaller extent the number of other enemy forces destroyed in the process of reaching and returning from the target area. \n\nAt the debriefing, given the mission outcome, the pilot may receive different medals or a promotion up to Colonel rank.\nIn case the player's helicopter exploded mid-air or crashed, the pilot will die and the player career will end. If landing in enemy territory, different outcomes are available, with the pilot being captured or killed or escaped to friendly territory or rescued by friendly forces.\n\nA 1992 \"Computer Gaming World\" survey of wargames with modern settings gave the game two and a half stars out of five, stating that it had a \"highly unrealistic flight model\". A 1994 survey gave it two stars, stating that \"it enjoyed more popular success than I thought it deserved\".\n\nIn 1994, \"PC Gamer US\" named \"LHX Attack Chopper\" the 29th best computer game ever. The editors wrote that \"what the game lacks in graphic polish it more than makes up for with fast action.\"\n"}

It is currently in the south of Merthyr Tydfil County Borough, but until 1974 was part of Gelligaer Urban District Council in the county of Glamorgan.\n\nIt has a population of around 1,400 people. The combined population of Bedlinog and Trelewis has been recently recorded as approximately 3,140, increasing to 3,277 at the 2011 census.\n\nBedlinog is the name of the village in both English and Welsh. The meaning of the name is somewhat unclear, but the usual suggestion is that it means the 'house near (the stream) Llwynog'. If so, the first element is a variant of the Welsh 'bod' ('dwelling'), and the second a variant of the name of a stream ('Llwynog') which literally means 'fox'. However, all forms of the name are relatively late (seventeenth century onwards) and show significant variation. During the nineteenth century the name was thought by some to have been formed from the elements 'bedd' ('grave') and 'llwynog' ('fox'), and the form 'Beddllwynog' ('fox's grave') is used by some Welsh speakers today. But it is not the standard Welsh form, and it is clear that 'Bedlinog' was the predominant form used by the area's Welsh-speakers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\n\nBedlinog village is in the Merthyr Tydfil County Borough, which covers the villages of Trelewis and Bedlinog, but is the only electoral ward within the Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council area which has its own Community Council.\n\nThe local rugby union club is Bedlinog RFC, founded in 1971 and a member of the Welsh Rugby Union.\n\nOne of the largest climbing centres in Europe less than a mile down the valley was closed briefly in 2008, but re-opened in October 2010.\n\nActress Gwenllian Davies (died 2007) was born in Bedlinog.\n\nProfessional bowls player Daniel Hiscock lives in the village. Right at the top. Out of all of us it would be him wouldn’t it. Not going over bogey road 4 times.\n\nBedlinog is home to the Bedroc festival, a major event in the Welsh language calendar which has been held over a weekend in June every year since 2008.\n\n"}
{"id": "2175118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175118", "title": "Refugium (population biology)", "text": "Refugium (population biology)\n\nIn biology, a refugium (plural: \"refugia\") is a location which supports an isolated or relict population of a once more widespread species. This isolation (allopatry) can be due to climatic changes, geography, or human activities such as deforestation and overhunting.\nPresent examples of refuge species are the mountain gorilla, isolated to specific mountains in central Africa, and the Australian sea lion, isolated to specific breeding beaches along the south-west coast of Australia, due to humans taking so many of their number as game. This resulting isolation, in many cases, can be seen as only a temporary state; however, some refugia may be longstanding, thereby having many endemic species, not found elsewhere, which survive as relict populations. The Indo-Pacific Warm Pool has been proposed to be a longstanding refugium, based on the discovery of the \"living fossil\" of a marine dinoflagellate called \"Dapsilidinium pastielsii\", currently found in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool only.\n\nIn anthropology, \"refugia\" often refers specifically to Last Glacial Maximum refugia, where some ancestral human populations may have been forced back to glacial refugia, similar small isolated pockets in the face of the continental ice sheets during the last glacial period. Going from west to east, suggested examples include the Franco-Cantabrian region (in northern Iberia), the Italian and Balkan peninsulas, the Ukrainian LGM refuge, and the Bering Land Bridge. Archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of Paleolithic humans survived the glacial maxima (incl. the Last Glacial Maximum) in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover.\n\nMore recently, \"refugia\" has been used to refer to areas that could offer relative climate stability in the face of modern climate change.\n\nAs an example of a locale refugia study, Jürgen Haffer first proposed the concept of refugia to explain the biological diversity of bird populations in the Amazonian river basin. Haffer suggested that climatic change in the late Pleistocene led to reduced reservoirs of habitable forests in which populations become allopatric. Over time, that led to speciation: populations of the same species that found themselves in different refugia evolved differently, creating parapatric sister-species. As the Pleistocene ended, the arid conditions gave way to the present humid rainforest environment, reconnecting the refugia.\n\nScholars have since expanded the idea of this mode of speciation and used it to explain population patterns in other areas of the world, such as Africa, Eurasia, and North America. Theoretically, current biogeographical patterns can be used to infer past refugia: if several unrelated species follow concurrent range patterns, the area may have been a refugium. Moreover, the current distribution of species with narrow ecological requirements tend to be associated with the spatial position of glacial refugia.\n\nOne can provide a simple explanation of refugia involving core temperatures and exposure to sunlight. In the northern hemisphere, north-facing sites on hills or mountains, and places at higher elevations count as \"cold sites\". The reverse are sun- or heat-exposed, lower-elevation, south-facing sites: \"hot sites\". (The opposite directions apply in the southern hemisphere.) Each site becomes a refugium, one as a \"cold-surviving refugium\" and the other as a \"hot-surviving refugium\". Canyons with deep hidden areas (the opposite of hillsides, mountains, mesas, etc. or other exposed areas) lead to these separate types of refugia.\n\nA concept not often referenced is that of \"sweepstakes colonization\": when a dramatic ecological event occurs, for example a meteor strike, and global, multiyear effects occur. The sweepstake-winning species happens to already be living in a fortunate site, and their environment is rendered even more advantageous, as opposed to the \"losing\" species, which immediately fails to reproduce.\n\nIn systematic conservation planning, the term \"refugium\" has been used to define areas that could be used in protected area development to protect species from climate change. The term has been used alternatively to refer to areas with stable habitats or stable climates. More specifically, the term \"in situ\" refugium is used to refer to areas that will allow species that exist in an area to remain there even as conditions change, whereas \"ex situ\" refugium refers to an area into which species distributions can move to in response to climate change. Sites that offer \"in situ\" refugia are also called \"resilient sites\" in which species will continue to have what they need to survive even as climate changes.\n\nOne study found with downscaled climate models that areas near the coast are predicted to experience overall less warming than areas toward the interior of the US State of Washington. Other research has found that old-growth forests are particularly insulated from climatic changes due to evaporative cooling effects from evapotranspiration and their ability to retain moisture. The same study found that such effects in the Pacific Northwest would create important refugia for bird species. A review of refugia-focused conservation strategy in the Klamath-Siskiyou Ecoregion found that, in addition to old-growth forest, the northern aspects of hillslopes and deep gorges would provide relatively cool areas for wildlife and seeps or bogs surrounded by mature and old-growth forests would continue to supply moisture even as water availability decreases.\nBeginning in 2010 the concept of geodiversity (a term used previously in efforts to preserve scientifically important geological features) entered into the literature of conservation biologists as a potential way to identify climate change refugia and as a surrogate (in other words, a proxy used when planning for protected areas) for biodiversity. While the language to describe this mode of conservation planning hadn't fully developed until recently, the use of geophysical diversity in conservation planning goes back at least as far as the work by Hunter and others in 1988, and Richard Cowling and his colleagues in South Africa also used \"spatial features\" as surrogates for ecological processes in establishing conservation areas in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The most recent efforts have used the idea of \"land facets\" (also referred to as \"geophysical settings\", \"enduring features\", or \"geophysical stages\"), which are unique combinations of topographical features (such as slope steepness, slope direction, and elevation) and soil composition, to quantify physical features. The density of these facets, in turn, is used as a measure of geodiversity. Because geodiversity has been shown to be correlated with biodiversity, even as species move in response to climate change, protected areas with high geodiversity may continue to protect biodiversity as niches get filled by the influx of species from neighboring areas. Highly geodiverse protected areas may also allow for the movement of species within the area from one land facet or elevation to another.\n\nConservation scientists, however, emphasize that the use of refugia to plan for climate change is not a substitute for fine-scale (more localized) and traditional approaches to conservation, as individual species and ecosystems will need to be protected where they exist in the present. They also emphasize that responding to climate change in conservation is not a substitute for actually limiting the causes of climate change.\n\n\n"}
