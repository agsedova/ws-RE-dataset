{"id": "2114521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2114521", "title": "Valie Export", "text": "Valie Export\n\nValie Export (often written as 'VALIE EXPORT') (born May 17, 1940 in Linz as Waltraud Lehner, later Waltraud Höllinger) is an Austrian artist. Her artistic work includes video installations, body performances, expanded cinema, computer animations, photography, sculptures and publications covering contemporary arts.\n\nEducated in a convent until the age of 14, Export studied painting, drawing, and design at the National School for Textile Industry in Vienna, and briefly worked in the film industry as a script girl, editor, and extra. Austrian feminism was forced to address the fact that by the 1970s there was still a generation of Austrians whose attitudes towards women were based on Nazi ideology. They also had to confront the guilt of their parents’ (mothers’) complacency within the Nazi regime. Export herself, before her political and artistic revolution, was a mother and a wife. In 1967, she changed her name to VALIE EXPORT (written in uppercase letters, like an artistic logo, shedding her father's and husband's names and appropriating her new surname from a popular brand of cigarettes). In conversation with Gary Indiana for \"BOMB\" magazine, Export described her name-change: \n\"I did not want to have the name of my father [Lehner] any longer, nor that of my former husband Hollinger. My idea was to export from my 'outside' (heraus) and also export, from that port. The cigarette package was from a design and style that I could use, but it was not the inspiration.\" With this gesture of self-determination, Export emphatically asserted her identity within the Viennese art scene, which was then dominated by the taboo-breaking performance art of the Vienna Actionists such as Hermann Nitsch, Günter Brus, Otto Mühl, and Rudolf Schwarzkogler. Of the Actionist movement, Export has said, “I was very influenced, not so much by Actionism itself, but by the whole movement in the city. It was a really great movement. We had big scandals, sometimes against the \"politique\"; it helped me to bring out my ideas.” Like her male contemporaries, she subjected her body to pain and danger in actions designed to confront the growing complacency and conformism of postwar Austrian culture. But her examination of the ways in which the power relations inherent in media representations inscribe women's bodies and consciousness distinguishes Export's project as unequivocally feminist.\n\nExport's early guerrilla performances have attained an iconic status in feminist art history. Her piece \"Tapp-und-Tast-Kino\" (\"Tap and Touch Cinema\") was performed in ten European cities in 1968-1971. In this avowedly revolutionary work, Export wore a tiny \"movie theater\" around her naked upper body, so that her body could not be seen but could be touched by anyone reaching through the curtained front of the \"theater.\" She then went into the street and invited men, women, and children to come and touch her. The media responded to Export's provocative work with panic and fear, one newspaper aligning her to a witch. Export recalls, \"There was a great campaign against me in Austria.\"\n\nSome of her other works including \"Invisible Adversaries,\" \"Syntagma,\" and \"Korpersplitter,\" show the artist's body in connection to historical buildings not only physically, but also symbolically. The bodies attachment to the historical progression of gendered spaces and stereotyped roles represent Export's feminist and political approach to art.\n\nExport's 1973 short film, \"Remote, Remote,\" exemplifies the painful ramifications of the female body conforming to societal standards. In this piece she digs at her cuticles with a knife for twelve minutes, representing the induced damage originating from the female body trying to maintain beauty standards and tradition.\n\nIn her 1970 photograph, “Body Sign Action,” Export portrays a politically charged agenda through her performance artwork. The piece features a tattoo of a garter belt on Export's naked upper leg. The garter is not attached at the top and only attached to a sliver of a stocking at the bottom- therefore suspended on the leg. Instead of the garter objectifying the body, the body objectifies the garter, flipping constructed societal roles in relation to the female body.\n\nIn her 1968 performance \"Aktionshose:Genitalpanik\" (\"Action Pants: Genital Panic\"), Export entered an art cinema in Munich, wearing crotchless pants, and walked around the audience with her exposed genitalia at face level. The associated photographs were taken in 1969 in Vienna, by photographer Peter Hassmann. The performance at the art cinema and the photographs in 1969 were both aimed toward provoking thought about the passive role of women in cinema and confrontation of the private nature of sexuality with the public venues of her performances. Apocryphal stories state that the \"Aktionshose:Genitalpanik\" performance occurred in a porn theater and included Export brandishing a machine gun and shooting at the audience, as depicted in the 1969 posters, however she claims this never occurred. In an interview in Ocula Magazine, the artist stated that: 'The fear of the vulva is present in mythology, where it is depicted devouring man. I don't know if this fear has changed.'\n\nThe contrast with what is usually called \"cinema\" is obvious, and is crucial to the message. In Export's performance, the female body is not packaged and sold by male directors and producers, but is controlled and offered freely by the woman herself, in defiance of social rules and state precepts. Also, the ordinary state-approved cinema is an essentially voyeuristic experience, whereas in Export's performance, the \"audience\" not only has a very direct, tactile contact with another person, but does so in the full view of Export and bystanders.\n\nExport's groundbreaking video piece, \"Facing a Family\" (1971) was one of the first instances of television intervention and broadcasting video art. The video, originally broadcast on the Austrian television program \"Kontakte\" February 2, 1971, shows a bourgeois Austrian family watching TV while eating dinner. When other middle-class families watched this program on TV, the television would be holding a mirror up to their experience and complicating the relationship between subject, spectator, and television. 1977 saw the release of her first feature film, \"Unsichtbare Gegner\". For this film's script, she collaborated with her former partner, Peter Weibel. Her 1985 film \"The Practice of Love\" was entered into the 35th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nSince 1995/1996 Export has held a professorship for multimedia performance at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne.\n\nIn her 1983 experimental film, \"Syntagma\", Export attempted to reframe the female body by using a multitude of \"...different cinematic montage techniques—doubling the body through overlays, for example\". The film follows Export's belief that the female body has, throughout history, been manipulated by men through the means of art and literature. In an interview with \"Interview Magazine\", Export discusses her movie, \"Syntagma\", and says, \"The female body has always been a construction\".\n\nIn another effort to expose the control of women by men, Export collected her powerful statements in a piece written for an exhibit she had organized titled MAGNA, Geminism: Art and Creativity. Within this piece titled \"Women’s Art a Manifesto\" (1972) she wrote empowering statements directed as a call to action, “let women speak so that they can find themselves, this is what I ask for in order to achieve a self-defined image of ourselves and thus a different view of the social function of women”. Here Export was pointing out the unjust way that women had been living their lives within the boundaries created by men. In this same Manifesto Export also says “the arts can be understood as a medium of our self-definition adding new values to the arts. these values, transmitted via the cultural sign-process, will alter reality towards an accommodation of female needs”. Here she is directly relating her own work to the progress of empowering women. With each new piece Export creates she is changing the way society views women.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2114529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2114529", "title": "Atatürk Dam", "text": "Atatürk Dam\n\nThe Atatürk Dam (), originally the Karababa Dam, is a zoned rock-fill dam with a central core on the Euphrates River on the border of Adıyaman Province and Şanlıurfa Province in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. Built both to generate electricity and to irrigate the plains in the region, it was renamed in honour of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (1881–1938), the founder of the Turkish Republic. The construction began in 1983 and was completed in 1990. The dam and the hydroelectric power plant, which went into service after the upfilling of the reservoir was completed in 1992, are operated by the State Hydraulic Works (DSİ). The reservoir created behind the dam, called Lake Atatürk Dam (), is the third largest in Turkey.\n\nThe dam is situated northwest of Bozova, Şanlıurfa Province, on state road D-875 from Bozova to Adıyaman. Centerpiece of the 22 dams on the Euphrates and the Tigris, which comprise the integrated, multi-sector, Southeastern Anatolia Project (, known as GAP), it is one of the world's largest dams. The Atatürk Dam, one of the five operational dams on the Euphrates as of 2008, was preceded by Keban and Karakaya dams upstream and followed by Birecik and the Karkamış dams downstream. Two more dams on the river have been under construction.\n\nThe dam embankment is and . The hydroelectric power plant (HEPP) has a total installed power capacity of 2,400 MW and generates 8,900 GW·h electricity annually.\nThe total cost of the dam project was about .\n\nThe dam was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish one-million-lira banknotes of 1995–2005 and of the 1 new lira banknote of 2005–2009.\n\nThe initial development project for the southeastern region of Turkey was presented in 1970. As the objectives for regional development have changed significantly and the ambitions have grown in the 1970s, the original plan underwent major modifications. The most important change in the project was abandoning the Middle Karababa Dam design, and adopting the design of the Atatürk Dam to increase the storage and power generation capacities of the dam.\n\nDolsar Engineering and ATA Construction, two prominent Turkish companies, signed for the building of the dam. The construction of the cofferdam began in 1985 and was completed in 1987. The fill work for the main dam lasted from 1987 to 1990. The Atatürk Dam, listed in international construction publications as the world's largest construction site, was completed in a world record time of around 50 months.\n\nThe rock-fill dam undergoes deformations that are regularly and systematically monitored since 1990 with different types of sensors. It is estimated that the central portion of the dam crest has settled by around since the end of the construction. Settlement of the dam crest up to has been measured since the start of the detailed geodetic monitoring in 1992. The maximum horizontal (radial) deformation measured is about .\n\nThe permeation grouting work was carried out by subcontractor Solétanche Bachy and the rehabilitation work for the post-tensioning of the dam crest with ground anchors by Vorspann System Losinger International (VSL).\n\nThe HEPP of the Atatürk Dam is the biggest of a series of 19 power plants of the GAP project. It consists of eight Francis turbine and generator groups of 300 MW each, supplied by Sulzer Escher Wyss and ABB Asea Brown Boveri respectively. The up to steel pressure pipes (penstocks) with a total weight of 26.600 tons were supplied and installed by the German NOELL company (today DSD NOELL). The power plant's first two power units came on line in 1992 and it became fully operational in December 1993. The HEPP can generate 8,900 GWh of electricity annually. Its capacity makes up around one third of the total capacity of the GAP project.\n\nDuring the periods of low demand for electricity, only one of the eight units of the HEPP is in operation while in times of high demand, all the eight units are in operation. Hence, depending upon the energy demand and the state of the interconnected system, the amount of water to be released from the HEPP might vary between 200 and 2,000 m/s in one day.\n\nOriginating in the mountains of eastern Anatolia and flowing southwards to Syria and Iraq, the Euphrates and the Tigris are very irregular rivers, used to cause great problems each year with droughts in summer and flooding in winter. The water of the Euphrates River is regulated by means of large reservoirs of the Keban and Atatürk Dams. However, the waters released from the HEPPs of those dams also need to be regulated. The Birecik and the Karkamış Dams downstream the Atatürk Dam are constructed for the purpose of harnessing the waters released from large-scale dams and HEPPs.\n\nNearly of arable land in the Şanlıurfa-Harran and Mardin-Ceylanpınar plains in upper Mesopotamia is being irrigated via gravity-flow with water diverted from the Atatürk Dam through the Şanlıurfa Tunnels system, which consists of two parallel tunnels, each long and in diameter. The flow rate of water through the tunnels is about , which makes one-third of the total flow of the Euphrates. The tunnels are the largest in the world, in terms of length and flow rate, built for irrigation purposes. The first tunnel was completed in 1995 and the other in 1996. The reservoir behind the dam will irrigate another 406,000 ha by pumping for a total of 882,000 ha.\n\nThe Atatürk Dam and the Şanlıurfa Tunnel system are two major components of the GAP project. Irrigation started in the Harran Plain in the spring of 1995. The impact of the irrigation on the economy of the region is significant. In ninety percent of the irrigated area, cotton is planted. Irrigation expansion within the Harran plains also increased Southeastern Anatolia's cotton production from 164,000 to 400,000 metric tons in 2001, or nearly sixty percent. With almost 50% share of the country's cotton production, the region developed to the leader in Turkey.\n\nThe reservoir Lake Atatürk Dam, extending over an area of with a water volume of 48.7 km (63,400 million cu yd), ranks third in size in Turkey after Lake Van and Lake Tuz. The reservoir water level touched amsl in 1994. Since then, it varies between 526 and 537 m amsl. The full reservoir level is , and the minimum operation level is amsl.\n\nSome 10 towns and 156 villages of three provinces are located around the Lake Atatürk Dam. The lake provides a fisheries and recreation site. For transportation purposes, several ferries have been operated in the reservoir. The reservoir lake is called \"sea\" by local people.\n\nAtatürk Dam Lake is an abundant source of food for local people and also provides opportunities for recreational fishing. In 1992, around 200,000 young fish (fingerlings), propagated in DSI's Atatürk Fish Hatchery, were introduced into the reservoir. Since then, the figure of fingerlings stocked into the lake reached around 33 million.\n\nCommercially fishing in the reservoir developed to a catch of around annually 1,000 tons of some fish species with a market value of US$1.26 million. 8 of the 12 fish species being caught are economically valuable. In addition, the lake has a potential for cage culture of 7,000 tons/year worth of US$14 million.\n\nWith the aim of utilizing the fishing potential and creating jobs for the lakeside populations, the reservoir is zoned to 21 fishing sectors, each one having a water products cooperative. Considering all aspects of fishery activities, the reservoir contributes in total US$15 million to GNP and generates employment for 1,600 people.\n\nIn order to open the region to tourism, to introduce modern sports to the local people and to integrate the social and economic progress taking place in the region with sports as a drive, a water sports festival was established in 1994, which takes place each year in September. The young people in the region developed an interest in water sports and started to take part in international contests in the branches of sailing, rowing-canoeing, swimming and diving on the Lake Atatürk Dam.\n\nFurthermore, International Atatürk Dam Sailing Competition takes place every year in October on the lake.\n\nWith the forming of the reservoir lake, more than a hundred hamlets and villages were inundated and about 55,000 people were forced to relocate, many of them resettling in nearby communities. According to other sources, the construction of the dam resulted in involuntary resettlement of between 45,000 to 53,500 people.\n\nIn 1989, the old town of Samosata (Samsat), capital of the ancient Commagene kingdom located in Adıyaman Province was flooded behind the Atatürk Dam. A new town with the same name, Samsat, was founded for the 2,000 people dislocated.\n\nThe birthplace of the Ancient Greek poet Lucian was lost when the dam was created.\n\nSince the entire GAP area was home to early civilization of the Hittites and the site of Nevalı Çori, and therefore rich in terms of historical remains, the cultural heritage of the region was a concern. The subject of salvaging cultural heritages gained importance, particularly after the inundation of Samsat.\n\nThe early Neolithic settlement of Nevalı Çori, site of some of the world's most ancient known temples and monumental sculpture, was discovered during rescue excavations before the dam was completed. Nevalı Çori was inundated by Atatürk Dam's reservoir.\n\nAbout 90% of Euphrates' total annual flow originates in Turkey, while the remaining part is added in Syria, but nothing is contributed further downstream in Iraq. In general, the stream varies greatly in its flow from season to season and year to year. As an example, the annual flow at the border with Syria ranged from in 1961 to in 1963.\n\nOne of the most important legal texts on the waters of the Euphrates-Tigris river system is the protocol annexed to the 1946 Treaty of Friendship and Good Neighborly Relations between Iraq and Turkey. The protocol provided the control and management of the Euphrates and the Tigris depending to a large extent on the regulations of flow in Turkish source areas. Turkey agreed to begin monitoring the two border-crossing rivers and to share related data with Iraq. In 1980, Turkey and Iraq further specified the nature of the earlier protocol by forming a joint committee on technical issues, which Syria joined later in 1982 as well. Turkey unilaterally guaranteed to allow 15.75 km/year (500 m/s) of water across the border to Syria without any formal agreement on the sharing of the Euphrates water.\n\nMid-January 1990, when the first phase of the dam was completed, Turkey held back the flow of the Euphrates entirely for a month to begin filling up the reservoir. Turkey had notified Syria and Iraq by November 1989 of her decision to fill the reservoir over a period of one month explaining the technical reasons and providing a detailed program for making up for the losses. The downstream neighbors protested vehemently. At this point, the Atatürk Dam has cut the flow from the Euphrates by about a third.\n\nSyria and Iraq claim to be suffering severe water shortages due to the GAP development. Both countries allege that Turkey is intentionally withholding supplies from its downstream neighbors, turning water into a weapon. Turkey denies these claims, and insists it has always supplied its southern neighbors with the promised minimum of . It argues that Iraq and Syria in fact benefit from the regulated water by the dams as they protect all three riparian countries from seasonal droughts and floods.\n\n\n"}

The most common source of wool aliens is when a plant, seed, or bur attaches to the wool of a sheep or other wool-producing animal prior to shearing. After the animal is shorn and the raw wool is transported to a refinery mill, the impurities are discarded along with the attached seed, which then successfully germinates. Wool aliens are typically found on waste ground near woollen mills. Wool cleanings have also been used as soil conditioners in orchards and fields, which may also contain wool alien species.\n\nStork's-bills (\"Erodium\") are particularly prone to appearing as wool aliens in Britain.\n"}

His eldest son William Tudor (1779-1830) became a leading literary figure in Boston. Another son, Frederic Tudor, founded the Tudor Ice Company and became Boston's \"Ice King\", shipping ice to the tropics from many local sources of fresh water including Walden Pond, Fresh Pond, and Spy Pond in Arlington, Massachusetts.\n\nTudor received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard College in 1769, studied law in the office of John Adams, was admitted to the Massachusetts Bay Colony Bar, July 27, 1772, and became outstanding in his profession. He joined George Washington's army in Cambridge where he provided legal advice to Washington and, on July 29, 1775, was appointed Judge Advocate of the Continental Army with the rank of colonel, and then Judge Advocate General (ranked Lieutenant-Colonel) on August 10, 1776. He was also Lieutenant-Colonel of Henley's Additional Continental Regiment.\n\nHe married Delia Jarvis on March 5, 1778 and resigned from the army on April 9, 1778 to re-establish himself as a lawyer. His practice flourished, and upon his father's death in 1796 he inherited an estate worth the then-considerable sum of $40,000. Six of their children survived infancy and early childhood: William Tudor (1779-1830); John Henry (1782–1802), who roomed with Washington Allston at Harvard; Frederic (September 4, 1783 – February 6, 1864); Emma Jane (1785–1865), who married Robert Hallowell Gardiner; Delia (1787–1861), who became the wife of Charles Stewart, captain of the USS \"Constitution\"; and Henry James (1791–1864).\n\nTudor served as a Representative of Boston in the Massachusetts General Court, 1781–1794; as a State Senator, 1801 and 1802; Secretary of the Commonwealth, 1808 and 1809; and was a founder of the Massachusetts Historical Society, whose first meeting was held on January 24, 1791 in his house on Court Street, Boston.\n\nThe Tudors' summer estate in Lynn (now Nahant), Massachusetts, was accumulated over the course of 25 years. In August 1787, Tudor bought the first of farmland plus of woodland. In May 1788, his father John Tudor purchased of land as well as of salt marsh in May 1788. William Tudor then purchased more salt marsh in 1790, of farmland in 1793, of pine grove in 1799 and more in 1801. After subsequent improvement by Tudor's son Frederic, the property has become the Nahant Country Club.\n\nTudor also owned a country estate in Saugus, Massachusetts (then part of Lynn), which he had inherited from his father. Known as \"Rockwood\", it was from the estate's pond that Tudor's son Frederic began harvesting ice for shipment to the Caribbean. The Tudors vacated the property in 1807 and leased it to other families until 1823, when it was purchased by the town for use as a poor farm. The farm was torn down in the 1950s and the property was used as the location for a new Saugus High School. Tudor was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814.\n\n"}

He played college football at West Virginia and was drafted by the Bengals in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft.\n\nHenry died on December 17, 2009 when he was dragged from a moving truck that his fiancé was driving after a verbal altercation. An autopsy revealed that Henry had developed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) during his playing career due to repetitive hits to the head. Because CTE can only be diagnosed in an autopsy and Henry was still active in the NFL when he died, Henry represented the first case where an active player had died and could be diagnosed with CTE.\n\nHenry was born to Carolyn Lee and David Henry in Belle Chasse, Louisiana. He attended Belle Chasse High School where he was named New Orleans small schools offensive player of the year during his senior year. During that season the Fighting Cardinals made it to the Louisiana AAA State championship game, which was played at the Louisiana Superdome. Henry also excelled in basketball and track.\n\nHenry enrolled at West Virginia University in 2002, spending his first season as a redshirt. In 2003, he earned Big East Conference freshman of the year and All-Big East second-team honors for catching 41 passes and gaining 1,006 yards and scoring 10 touchdowns. He also became the second player in school history to record over 1,000 receiving yards in one season (behind David Saunders), and his 24.5 yards per reception are the third most in a season in school history. Henry's best game was a career-high performance of 209 yards and two touchdowns against Syracuse. His career-long reception came against Rutgers that season, an 83-yard reception.\n\nIn 2004, Henry started seven games and caught 52 passes for 872 yards with 12 touchdowns. After catching three passes in a 30–18 loss to Florida State in the 2005 Gator Bowl, Henry announced that he would enter the 2005 NFL Draft.\n\nDuring Henry's sophomore season, he was ejected from a game at Rutgers University due to multiple unsportsmanlike conduct penalties and was suspended for the season finale against the University of Pittsburgh. His former Mountaineers coach, Rich Rodriguez, stated that he was \"an embarrassment to himself and the program\" for his conduct.\n\nHenry majored in athletic coaching education.\n\nHenry was the third player in Mountaineers' history to average more than twenty yards per catch for his career. Henry's 1,878 career receiving yards is eighth most in school history, while his 93 receptions are the 14th most. His 22 touchdown receptions are also second most in school history. Henry's six career 100-yard receiving games is tied for third most in school history.\n\nHenry was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He made his NFL debut on September 18, 2005 against the Minnesota Vikings. In his rookie season with the Bengals, he amassed 31 receptions for 422 yards and six touchdowns. In the Bengals' first playoff game in fifteen years against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he had a reception for 66 yards on the Bengals' second play from scrimmage. However, on the play, both he and Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer suffered knee injuries.\n\nIn his second season, Henry totaled 605 yards on 36 receptions for nine touchdowns, with an average of 16.8 yards per catch. On the second game of the season against the Cleveland Browns, Henry recorded five receptions for 113 yards, while he recorded two touchdowns the next week against the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the season finale against the Steelers, Henry totaled 124 yards off of four receptions and scored one touchdown.\n\nHenry was suspended for eight games in 2007 for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy. He returned in week 10 against the Baltimore Ravens, where he had four receptions for 99 yards. In the following loss to Arizona, Henry totaled eight receptions for 81 yards and one touchdown. Henry finished the season with 21 receptions for 343 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nFollowing his arrest in April 2008, Henry was waived by the Bengals. President Mike Brown explained that Henry had forfeited his opportunity to pursue a career with the Bengals and that his conduct could no longer be tolerated.\n\nOn April 7, 2008, ESPN radio analyst and former player Michael Irvin said he took a phone call from Henry, discussing \"cleaning up his act\", much like Irvin encouraged Adam \"Pacman\" Jones to do. Henry and Jones were teammates at West Virginia, and both served NFL suspensions imposed by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell during the 2007 NFL season.\n\nWith Bengals receivers Chad Ochocinco, T. J. Houshmandzadeh, and Andre Caldwell nursing injuries during the 2008 preseason, Henry was re-signed to a two-year contract by the Bengals on August 18. The move came less than a month after Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis stated the team had no interest in bringing back Henry. After serving his four-game suspension to begin the 2008 season, Henry was activated from the exemption list on October 4. Henry finished the 2008 season with 19 receptions for 220 yards and two touchdowns. He was placed on injured reserve in November 2009, after suffering a broken forearm while making a 20-yard reception against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nOn December 15, 2005, Henry was pulled over in northern Kentucky for speeding. During a search, marijuana was found in his shoes. He was also driving without a valid driver's license or valid insurance. He pleaded guilty and avoided a jail sentence.\n\nOne month later, on January 30, 2006, he was arrested in Orlando, Florida for multiple gun charges including concealment and aggravated assault with a firearm. He was reported to have been wearing his #15 Bengals jersey at the time of his arrest. He pleaded guilty to this charge and avoided jail time.\n\nOn April 29, 2006 Henry allowed three females under the legal drinking age (ages 18, 16 and 15) to consume alcohol at a hotel in Covington, Kentucky. One of the three, an 18-year-old woman, accused Henry of sexually assaulting her; she later retracted her story and was charged with filing a false police report. \n\nHenry was pulled over on Interstate 275 in Ohio on June 3, 2006 at 1:18 a.m. by Ohio Highway Patrol trooper Michael Shimko for suspected drunk driving. He voluntarily submitted to a breathalyzer test at 2:06 A.M. at the Milford Police Department and registered a .092 blood-alcohol level, .012 above the level permitted in the state of Ohio.\n\nOn October 6, 2006 Henry was suspended by the NFL for two games for violating the league's substance abuse and personal conduct policies. NFL policies forbade Henry from taking part in practices; however, he was allowed to attend any team meetings. Henry missed the Bengals' October 15, 2006 game at Tampa Bay and their October 22, 2006 home game versus Carolina.\n\nOn January 25, 2007, Henry pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of a city ordinance commonly referred to as a \"keg law.\" He was sentenced to 90 days in jail, with all but two of those days being suspended.\n\nIn April 2007, Henry was suspended for the first eight games of the 2007 NFL season for violations of the NFL's personal conduct policy. His suspension on the 10th came with a stern warning that future misconduct may result in the end of his career with the NFL. Henry was given permission by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to begin practicing fully. His suspension was lifted and he played in the November 11, 2007 game versus the Baltimore Ravens, amassing 4 catches for 99 yards.\n\nHenry allegedly assaulted a valet attendant at Newport on the Levee in Newport, Kentucky on November 6, 2007. He was arrested for a second time in Orlando on December 3 for violating his probation he was on from a January 30, 2006 arrest. On February 21, 2008, he was found not guilty.\n\nOn March 31, 2008, Henry punched a man named Gregory Meyer, 18, in the face and threw a beer bottle through the window of his car. Henry claimed it was a case of mistaken identity and that he thought it was somebody else that owed him money. Henry was waived by the Bengals a day after this arrest and was then served a house arrest sentence.\n\nOn December 16, 2009, Henry sustained injuries when he fell out of the back of a moving truck driven by his fiancée Loleini Tonga, while they were engaged in a domestic dispute. Tonga has three children by Henry. On December 17, 2009, Charlotte police announced that Henry had died at 6:36 a.m. ET at Carolinas Medical Center from the injuries sustained in the domestic dispute. Two days later, on December 19, police confirmed that Henry died of blunt force trauma to the head. No charges were filed against his fiancée, and police announced that they found no evidence that Tonga drove recklessly or with excessive speed. There was no alcohol in Henry's blood at the time of the incident.\n\nTo honor Henry, every game of Week 15 (December 17–21) in the NFL that year began with a moment of silence before kickoff.\n\n\"Our football team, what they're feeling yesterday and this morning ... they watched a guy mature as a young man and work through adversity,\" Lewis said, adding that Henry became \"a beacon of hope.\" \n\nOn December 20, three days after Henry's death, the Bengals traveled to Qualcomm Stadium to face the San Diego Chargers. As with all the other Week 15 games, a moment of silence was held before kickoff. Bengals wide receiver Chad Ochocinco, a close friend of Henry's, openly wept during the silence. Later in the game, on his first touchdown reception, Ochocinco dropped to his knee and paid tribute to Henry in the end-zone.\n\nIn June 2010, the Brain Injury Research Institute of West Virginia University released a report that Henry had developed a brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy during his playing career due to multiple hard hits to the head. While several former NFL players had been found to have the disease after their deaths, Henry was believed to be the first still-active NFL player to have it. The discovery that Henry had CTE has become a serious issue of concern for football and brain safety, especially since Henry was relatively young and had never been diagnosed with a concussion in any of his five NFL seasons or during his college career at West Virginia. Concern has been raised whether an accumulation of lesser blows could eventually be enough to cause brain damage. It was also believed that the brain damage Henry suffered may have been a factor in his numerous off-the-field incidents.\n\nAfter his death, Henry's mother made the decision to donate his organs for transplant. Henry's corneas, lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, and pancreas were transplanted, saving the lives of four people.\n\n\n"}

The art of poetry was learnt orally, i.e. examples were learnt by heart and exercises given as spoken instruction.

{"id": "2114566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2114566", "title": "Ipe Ivandić", "text": "Ipe Ivandić\n\nGoran \"Ipe\" Ivandić (December 10, 1955 in Vareš, PR Bosnia-Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia – January 12, 1994 in Belgrade, Serbia, FR Yugoslavia) was a Bosnian rock drummer, famous for his work with the band Bijelo Dugme.\n\nIvandić was born in the central Bosnian town of Vareš. He moved to Sarajevo as a young boy. While in elementary school, Ivandić also attended violin classes on the side, but after final exam abruptly decided he didn't want to \"bother with the instrument any longer\".\n\nHis next musical engagement of note came in 1970 when, along with some friends, Ivandić founded a music section within the Boško Buha youth centre simply because it was willing to provide free instruments. They named their band Crossroads with Ivandić playing the drums. With the band taking up most of his free time, he started neglecting school and as a result flunked his sophomore year of high school and had to repeat it. He soon switched to part-time secondary education.\n\nIn June 1972, Ivandić went on a three-month summer gig in Trpanj as part of the band called Moby Dick.\n\nAfter getting back to Sarajevo, he started receiving plenty of offers from groups looking for a drummer and decided to join the band called Rock. They also featured organist Gabor Lenđel who would later in 1974 found the hard rock band Teška Industrija on the ashes of Rock.\n\nIvandić was still the drummer in Rock when Jutro bandleader Goran Bregović became aware of him during late summer 1973. Seeking a replacement for Šento Borovčanin, Bregović immediately invited Ivandić to join Jutro, which Ivandić accepted. Ivandić thus began the first of his three stints with what would soon become the most popular band in SFR Yugoslavia. Several months later, on New Year's Eve 1974, Jutro changed its name to Bijelo Dugme.\n\nAfter recording two hugely successful albums \"Kad bi' bio bijelo dugme\" and \"Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu\", as well as playing the accompanying tours, Ivandić received an early call up to serve the mandatory Yugoslav People's Army stint in October 1976. The call up came at the most inopportune time as the band was getting ready to start recording their third album, but Ivandić had to go nonetheless. Still 20 years old at the time, he was assigned to a unit stationed in capital city Belgrade. His replacement in the band was Bregović's old companion Milić Vukašinović. Ivandić rejoined the band immediately after getting back from the army in mid 1977 (he was actually discharged early due to being pronounced \"temporarily unable to serve\").\n\nHe rejoined the band at the time when it was mired in deep personality clashes in the middle of a disastrous tour featuring problems with equipment, sound and organizational issues.\n\nIn 1978 while Bijelo Dugme was on hiatus because band leader Bregović was away in Niš serving his army stint, Ivandić and Bijelo Dugme keyboardist Laza Ristovski started working on their own project – an album titled \"Stižemo\" with their act named Laza i Ipe. The material composed by Ristovski, arranged by Ipe, with lyrics written by Ranko Boban was recorded in London throughout February and March 1978 featuring Ivandić, his sister Gordana Ivandić and Goran Kovačević on vocals, Leb i Sol leader Vlatko Stefanovski on guitar, Zlatko Hold on bass, and Ristovski on keyboards. However, the release date kept getting pushed back due to financing issues as they had problems convincing the Jugoton record label to cover their expenses.\n\nSimultaneously, during Bregović's temporary army leaves, the duo, backed up by Bijelo Dugme singer Željko Bebek, initiated many discussions as they wanted things inside the band to be handled differently going forward. Most of the issues they brought up boiled down to writing credits and subsequent revenue sharing. Dissatisfied with Bregović's flat rejection of their demands, the two abandoned Bijelo Dugme altogether in late July 1978 in order to fully commit to their new project.\n\nBack on the side project front, the money issues with Jugoton were solved by taking the material over to ZKP RTLJ label while some of the money was obtained through Bijelo Dugme bandmate Zoran Redžić. The album \"Stižemo\" ended up being promoted very ambitiously with high quality press material. It was also the first time in Yugoslavia that an album's release date was publicly announced in advance – a widely used practice at the time was to release an album and then promote it when it is already in stores.\n\nThen on September 10, 1978, the day of the album release, while entering his apartment building in Sarajevo, coming back from a walk with his girlfriend, 22-year-old Ivandić was arrested by a plain clothes policeman who said he is taking him in for questioning. Ivandić had been set to leave for Belgrade in a matter of hours where Laza was waiting so they can do promotional activities for the album. Instead, Ivandić got charged with a series of drug offenses along with other individuals. He thus began a long court battle and most of his musical activities got pushed to the back burner. He even sold his drum kit and went back to his university studies, passing a few exams at the University of Sarajevo's Faculty of Political Sciences where he had been enrolled in the journalism program. However, he soon returned to drumming, playing on the 22-year-old Slađana Milošević's 1979 debut album \"Gorim od želje da ubijem noć\" recorded in PGP-RTB's studios in Belgrade.\n\nEventually, Ivandić got sentenced by the Sarajevo District Court three-judge council presided over by judge Husein Hubijer to 3 and a half years in prison for \"possession of hashish and enabling others to use narcotics\". Also sentenced by the council on the same charge were Goran Kovačević to year and a half, Ranko Boban to 1 year. Furthermore, Zlatko Hold got sentenced to six months for obstruction of justice. Ivandić appealed the verdict, and his sentence was reduced to 3 years by the Supreme Court of SR Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nHe began serving his punishment at the Zenica correctional facility. On February 17, 1981, he got transferred to another prison, in Foča, before getting pardoned some year and a half later for Republic Day 1982 (November 29).\n\nAfter being freed, he rejoined Bijelo Dugme in late December 1982 thus beginning his third stint with the band that lasted until 1989, when the band dissolved.\n\nDuring the mid 1980s he also recorded two albums, \"Kakav divan dan\" and \"Igre slobode\", with his long-time girlfriend Amila Sulejmanović. After the albums' recording Amila moved to London while Ivandić stopped all side projects and devoted fully to Bijelo Dugme.\n\nIt is unclear where he lived after the war started. Most say that he lived in Belgrade but in a 1994 interview for Croatian weekly \"Globus\" (conducted days after Ivandić's death), Željko Bebek states Ivandić lived in Vienna, at least at the time they last talked.\n\nOn January 12, 1994, Ivandić fell from the 6th floor of Belgrade's Metropol Hotel and died. It is generally believed that it was a suicide, but Bebek in the same interview says he has trouble believing it based on his prior knowledge of Ivandić and his habits.\n\nOne of the most important things, Ivandić has a son, named Filip Ivandić, born 1991. in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Also, Goran was happily married with Dragana Ivandić, born in Belgrade.\n\n\n"}

H. Liddell Hart after World War I. It was an attempt to find a solution to the problem of high casualty rates in conflict zones with high force to space ratios, such as the Western Front on which he served. The strategy calls for armies to advance along the line of least resistance.\n\n\"Throughout the ages, effective results in war have rarely been attained unless the approach has had such \"indirectness\" as to ensure the opponent’s unreadiness to meet it… \"In strategy, the longest way round is often the shortest way home\".” A direct approach to the object exhausts the attacker and hardens the resistance by compression, where as an indirect approach loosens the defender's hold by upsetting his balance\".\n\n\"In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack – the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle – you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?\"\n\nThere were two fundamental principles which governed the indirect approach.\n\n\nWhile Liddell Hart originally developed the theory for infantry, contact with J. F. C. Fuller helped change his theory more towards tanks. The indirect approach would become a major factor in the development of blitzkrieg. Often misunderstood, the indirect approach is not a treatise against fighting direct battles; it was still based on the Clausewitzian ideal of direct combat and the destruction of an enemy force by arms. It was in reality an attempt to create a doctrine for the remobilization of warfare after the costly attrition of the strategic stalemate of the First World War.\n\n"}

It is widely believed, along with Al Ghurabaa, to be the reformed Al-Muhajiroun which Omar Bakri Muhammad disbanded in 2004. It is believed that Omar Bakri today still heads this organisation.\n\nThe Saved Sect believe the majority of Muslims living in the Western world are forgetting their roots, and sees their primary purpose as being to remind the Ummah of what they regard as true Islamic values.\n\nThe name of the group is derived from a hadith (or tradition) ascribed to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad,\n\"My ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of whom will be in Hell except one group.\" They said: Who are they, O Messenger of Allaah? He said: \"(Those who follow) that which I and my companions follow.\" This is mentioned in the hadeeth of 'Abd-Allaah ibn 'Amr which was recorded and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi (2641). It was also classed as hasan by al-'Iraaqi in Ahkaam al-Qur'aan (3/432), al-'Iraaqi in Takhreej al-Ihya' (3/284) and al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.\n\nOn 17 July 2006 the group was banned under new legislation in Britain. Home Secretary John Reid laid an order in Parliament which made it a criminal offence for a person to belong to or encourage support for the group, to arrange meetings in its support, or to wear clothes or carry articles in public indicating support or membership.\n\nAlthough the organisation's website claims to represent the views of the Saviour Sect in Islam, they do not claim that they themselves are the Saviour Sect, as this apparently would be ascribing purity to themselves and would also indicate that they have knowledge of al-Ghayb (the unseen), which Muslims believe only Allah knows about.\n\nThey claim to be followers of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah (People of the Sunnah and the Community) and that their teachings are of as-Salaf us-Saalih (the Pious Predecessors). However, many Sunnis firmly refute this.\n\nIn November 2005, Al Ghurabaa and the Saved Sect were re-established under the name Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah. This organisation operates mainly through an invitation-only Internet forum, of which Anjem Choudary is a prominent contributor, using the username \"Abou Adha\". A reporter visiting the site found recordings of Osama Bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Omar Bakri Mohammed, as well as calls for holy war.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2114633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2114633", "title": "Mansi language", "text": "Mansi language\n\nThe Mansi languages (previously, \"Vogul\" and also \"Maansi\") are or were spoken by the Mansi people in Russia along the Ob River and its tributaries, in the Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug, and Sverdlovsk Oblast. Traditionally considered a single language, they constitute a branch of the Uralic languages, often considered most closely related to the neighbouring Khanty languages and then to Hungarian. According to the 2010 census, there were 940 Mansi-speaking people in Russia, out of an ethnic population of 12 thousand.\n\nThe base dialect of the Mansi literary language is the Sosva dialect, a representative of the northern language. The discussion below is based on the standard language. Fixed word order is typical in Mansi. Adverbials and participles play an important role in sentence construction. A written language was first published in 1868, and the current Cyrillic alphabet was devised in 1937.\n\nMansi is subdivided into four main dialect groups which are to a large degree mutually unintelligible, and therefore best considered four languages. A primary split can be set up between the Southern variety and the remainder. A number of features are also shared between the Western and Eastern varieties, while certain later sound changes have diffused between Eastern and Northern (and are also found in some neighboring dialects of Northern Khanty to the east).\n\nIndividual dialects are known according to the rivers their speakers live(d) on:\nThe sub-dialects given above are those which were still spoken in the late 19th and early 20th century and have been documented in linguistic sources on Mansi. Pre-scientific records from the 18th and early 19th centuries exist also of other varieties of Western and Southern Mansi, spoken further west: the Tagil, Tura and Chusovaya dialects of Southern and the Vishera dialect of Western.\n\nThe two dialects last mentioned were hence spoken on the western slopes of the Urals, where also several early Russian sources document Mansi settlements. Placename evidence has been used to suggest Mansi presence reaching still much further west in earlier times, though this has been criticized as poorly substantiated.\n\nNorthern Mansi has strong Russian, Komi, Nenets, and Northern Khanty influence, and it forms the base of the literary Mansi language. There is no accusative case; that is, both the nominative and accusative roles are unmarked on the noun. and have been backed to and .\n\nWestern Mansi went extinct ca. 2000. It had strong Russian and Komi influences; dialect differences were also considerable. Long vowels were diphthongized.\n\nEastern Mansi is spoken by 100–200 people. It has Khanty and Tatar influence. There is vowel harmony, and for it has , frequently diphthongized.\n\nSouthern Mansi was recorded from area isolated from the other Mansi varieties. Around 1900 a couple hundred speakers existed; in the 1960s it was spoken only by a few elderly speakers, and it has since then gone extinct. It had strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as vowel harmony, retention of (elsewhere merged with ), (elsewhere deaffricated to ), (elsewhere fronted to or diphthongized) and (elsewhere raised to ).\n\nThe inventory presented here is a maximal collection of segments found across the Mansi varieties. Some remarks:\n\nThe vowel systems across Mansi show great variety. As typical across the Uralic languages, many more vowel distinctions were possible in the initial, stressed syllable than in unstressed ones. Up to 18–19 stressed vowel contrasts may be found in the Western and Eastern dialects, while Northern Mansi has a much reduced, largely symmetric system of 8 vowels, though lacking short ** and long **:\n\nThe first publication of the written Mansi language was a translation of the Gospel of Matthew published in London in 1868. In 1932 a version of Latin alphabet was introduced with little success. The former Latin alphabet:\n\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, Ꜧ, I, J, K, L, Ļ, M, N, Ņ, Ŋ, O, P, R, S, S, T, Ţ, U, V, Z, Ь\n\nIn 1937, Cyrillic replaced the Latin.\n\nMansi is an agglutinating, subject–object–verb (SOV) language.\n\nThere are two articles in Mansi: definite ань (aɲ), which also means \"now\" when placed before verbs, and indefinite акв (akʷ), literally \"one\".\n\nThere is no grammatical gender. Mansi distinguishes between singular, dual and plural number. Six grammatical cases exist. Possession is expressed using possessive suffixes, for example -зм, which means \"my\".\n\nExample with: пут /put/ (cauldron)\n\nMissing cases can be expressed using postpositions, such as халнэл (χalnəl, 'of, out of'), саит (sait, 'after, behind'), etc.\n\nMansi conjugation has three persons, three numbers, two tenses, and four moods. Active and passive voices exist.\n\nIntransitive and transitive conjugations are distinguished. This means that there are two possible ways of conjugating a verb. When the speaker conjugates in intransitive, the sentence has no concrete object (in this case, the object is \"nothing\" or something like \"something, anything\"). In the transitive conjugation, there is a concrete object. This feature also exists in the other Ugric languages.\n\nMansi uses suffixes to express the tense. The tense suffix precedes the personal suffix.\nThe language has no future tense; the future is expressed in other ways.\n\nThere are four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and precative.\n\nIndicative mood has no suffix. Imperative mood exists only in the second person.\n\nThe suffixes are the following:\n\nThus, the conjugation of the verb мина (lat. \"mina\" [go]), in past tense (remember the suffix -с):\n\nVerbs have active and passive voice. Active voice has no suffix; the suffix to express the passive is -ве-.\nVerbal prefixes are used to modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways. For example, with the prefix эл- (el-) (away, off) the verb мина (mina) (go) becomes элмина (elmina), which means \"to go away\". This is surprisingly close to the Hungarian equivalents: \"el-\" (away) and \"menni\" (to go), where \"elmenni\" is \"to go away\"\n\nēl(a) – 'forwards, onwards, away'\nχot – 'direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity'\nNumbers 1 and 2 also have attributive forms: акв (1) and кит (2); compare with Hungarian \"két\", Old Hungarian \"kit\").\n\nам хул алысьлаӈкве минасум. – I went fishing (literally \"\"I fish catch went\"\").\n\n\n"}

Soon after, they were discovered at a local club by bassist Ben Perlstein (formerly with Milwaukee ska group The Invaders), who replaced Forchette, and brought drummer Jon Phillip (formerly with Shaft) into the group. The Benjamins recorded their first disc, \"Bordering on Boredom\", on Labor Day of 1999. The EP features six songs that earned favorable attention for the band after the album was released in February 2000. \n\nAfter garnering a solid fanbase throughout the Midwest — including shows with Alkaline Trio, The Mr. T Experience, and Superdrag — The Benjamins were interviewed for an online zine by a fan named Jared Blohm at a concert at the Rock 'n' Roll High School in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The fan turned out to be a street team representative for Drive-Thru Records, and after a brief courtship, the label agreed to sign the band. Their second release and first full-length album, The Art of Disappointment — featuring the production of the Grammy-nominated Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters, Superdrag, Queens of the Stone Age), graphic design of former The Promise Ring guitarist Jason Gnewikow, and cover-modeling of Aiko Sakai — was released on the California-based Drive-Thru Records in February 2001. \nWhile constant touring was done in support on The Art of Disappointment, The Benjamins were regularly part of mismatched tours, including dates alongside Reel Big Fish, Sum 41, and Showoff, in addition to a brief stint on the 2001 Warped Tour. In late 2001, the band decided to take a hiatus, which turned into a break-up before year's end. \n\nIn the years that followed, the band performed the occasional reunion show in Milwaukee, the last one being in 2004. Perlstein currently lives in New York City and works in music management, and his clients include Tommy Stinson/The Replacements, Smoking Popes and Trapper Schoepp & The Shades and runs Good Land Records with Jon Phillip. Following time in The Obsoletes with former members of Yesterday's Kids, Phillip joined the Orange County, California-based Limbeck in August 2005 until their disbanding in 2010. In 2011, Phillip both joined Trapper Schoepp & The Shades on drums and co-founded Good Land Records. Hinz has become a permanent member of Maritime with former members of The Promise Ring and The Dismemberment Plan. Stys remains based in Milwaukee, like Hinz and Phillip, and has moved over into the culinary world. The band reunited on July 10, 2013 at a local outdoor music festival for a brief, surprise set and had such a nice time that they will co-headline a benefit show at Turner Hall in Milwaukee with fellow Milwaukee underground legends Alligator Gun on January 18, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She first began her singing career singing in local nightclubs. A single mother, she has one daughter.\n\nBrown is known for her 2005 Canadian radio hit \"Old Skool Love\". The single and video whet the appetites of U.S. Soul music fans, and a Reggae remix version secured the attention of Riddim junkies in Jamaica fueling Divine to reach for something more. Even without an album prior to 2005, she was invited to perform at various musical festivals around the world. Her debut album \"Divine Brown\" was an underground hit and was fairly successful in the mainstream market. She has a five-octave vocal range. Her second album, \"The Love Chronicles\", was released on August 19, 2008 and won a Juno award for best R&B/Soul album of the year in 2009.

Divine offers that the new album possesses an \"old school vibe with a new school twist\" and as such, \"Something Fresh\" draws upon the blueprint of her first two hit albums displaying her retro sensibilities while fully representing today through its lyrical content, musical arrangements and hip-hop inspired production values to be a decidedly fresh contemporary Soul/R&B offering.First single \"Gone\" is set to release early summer. \"Gone\" produced and co-written by the Rezza Brothers. In 2016, Brown performed with Gowan as backup vocalist on a small string of shows in the Toronto area.\nIn October 2016 Divine Brown announced on social media a brand new single is set to drop titled \"Love Alibi\" a collaboration with Universal Music Publishing & Songwriting duo 80 Empire.

The song originally appeared as a B-side to Oasis' first UK #1 single, \"Some Might Say\", on 24 April 1995. Its popularity led to it being included on the B-sides compilation album \"The Masterplan\", released in 1998, after being voted for inclusion by fans of the band on their official website.\n\nIn 1998, the song was issued as a radio single in the United States to promote the release of \"The Masterplan\". It reached #24 in the US Modern Rock Chart, based on radio airplay.\n\n\"Acquiesce\" was also released as one of the lead tracks to the \"Stop the Clocks\" EP, in promotion of their compilation album of which it also appears on, \"Stop the Clocks\".\n\nThe verses to \"Acquiesce\" are sung by Liam Gallagher, with the chorus sung by Noel (because, he claims, Liam could not reach the high notes), making it the first song to ever feature both Gallagher brothers on lead vocals. The only other Oasis songs to feature both brothers on lead vocals are \"Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is\", from their 2000 album \"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\", \"Born on a Different Cloud\" from their 2002 album \"Heathen Chemistry\" and \"Let There Be Love\", from their 2005 album \"Don't Believe the Truth\".\n\nNoel Gallagher claims to have written the lyrics to \"Acquiesce\" on the way to the studio for the recording sessions of \"Definitely Maybe\". The train was delayed, and during this interruption, he wrote parts of the song. According to \"The Masterplan\"s sleeve notes (written by music writer and critic Paul Du Noyer), \"The song is about friendship in the widest sense and not, as often speculated, about the Gallagher brothers themselves.\"\n\n\"Acquiesce\" became a fan favourite and was regularly played live. Many Oasis fans feel this song should have been held back to go on the \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" album, with others also feeling the song was strong enough to have been released as a single. This was an opinion that Alan McGee had when he first heard the song; he tried to convince Noel to release \"Acquiesce\" as a single instead of \"Some Might Say\". Noel rejected this idea because he was adamant that the work on the single was completed, and was unwilling to have to write another B-side and record it. However, Noel has since said that this and a couple of other songs such as \"The Masterplan\" were strong enough to have been album tracks and singles.\n\nThe studio recording of the song features clips of an acoustic version of another Oasis song, \"Morning Glory\". This is heard at the beginning and at the end of the song. Also, over the distortion and guitars of the intro, a conversation between Liam and an anonymous voice (which is believed to be of co-producer Owen Morris) can be heard, played in reverse. Played correctly, the conversation goes:\n\nOwen: \"Where's Noel?\"\nLiam: \"Gone for a walk\"\nUnknown voice: \"Sacked him\"\nOwen: \"<nowiki><indecipherable></nowiki>\"\nLiam: \"I've sacked him\"\n\nThe song is featured in the episode \"The Day Before\" (season 1, episode 12) of the television show \"Jericho\", in the movie \"Goal!\", and has been covered by bands such as the Killers, Good Charlotte and Third Eye Blind.\n\nThere are two music videos for this single.\n\nThe first video was the live performance at the G-Mex Centre in Manchester, on 14 December 1997. The vocals on this footage were overdubbed from another performance.\n\nThe second video was filmed at the Electric Ballroom in Camden, London, on 12 September 2006, but did not feature the band. Instead, a Japanese look-alike/tribute band played the roles of Oasis. More footage is also understood to have been filmed in Japan, mirroring the idea featured in R.E.M.'s 1995 video for \"Crush with Eyeliner.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a term used for reconverting those that are deemed to have converted away from Hinduism back to Hinduism.\n\nThe socio-political movement, derived from ancient rite of \"shuddhikaran\", or purification was started by the Arya Samaj, and its founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati and his followers like swami Shraddhanand, who also worked on the \"Sangathan\" consolidation aspect of Hinduism, in North India, especially Punjab in early 1900s, though it gradually spread across India. Shuddhi had a social reform agenda behind its belligerent rationale and was aimed at abolishing the practise of untouchability by converting outcasts from other religions to Hinduism and integrating them into the mainstream community by elevating their position, and instilling self-confidence and self-determination in them. The movement strove to reduce the conversions of Hindus to Islam and Christianity, which were underway at the time.\n\nIn 1923, Swami Shraddhanand founded the 'Bhartiya Hindu Shuddhi Mahasabha' (Indian Hindu Purification Council) and pushed the agenda of reconversion, which eventually created a flashpoint between Hindus and Muslims as Muslims were the recipients of the violence.. The main point of contention was the reconversion Malkana Rajputs in western United Province As a result, the movement became controversial and antagonized the Muslims populace and also led to the death of the leader of the movement, Swami Shraddhanand in 1926. Post Swami Shraddhanand death this movement continued.\n\nOn 23 February 1928, many Catholic Gaudes in Goa were re-converted to Hinduism notwithstanding the opposition of the Church and the Portuguese government. This was carried out by a Hindu religious institution from Mumbai known as \"Masur Ashram\", the converts were given Sanskrit Hindu names, but the Portuguese government put impediments in their way to get legal sanction for their new Hindu names. 4851 Catholic Gaudes from Tiswadi, 2174 from Ponda, 250 from Bicholim and 329 from Sattari were re-converted to Hinduism after nearly 400 years. The total number of the converts to Hinduism was 7815.\nHowever, in Northern India this movement faced stiff opposition from Islamic organisations and the Sunni Barelvi organisation All India Jamaat Raza-e-Mustafa in Bareilly city, which attempted to counter the efforts of the Shuddhi movement to convert Muslims to Hinduism in British India.\n\n\n"}

From 1991–2018, it was named the Women's Premier League (WPL) and included England's top division from 1991–2010.\n\nThe leagues now sit at step 3 and 4 of the women's football pyramid, below the FA WSL and the Women's Championship.\n\nThe Women's Premier League National Division contained England's top women's clubs from 1991–92 until the season 2009–10. During this time, Arsenal W.F.C. won 12 WPL titles. Below the National Division was a Northern Division and Southern Division, whose teams could win promotion.\n\nThe WPL National Division became the country's level 2 division from 2010–11 to 2012–13 (with the Northern and Southern at level 3).\n\nThe WPL National Division ended in 2013, and was replaced at level 2 by FA WSL 2, later renamed the Championship. The Northern Division and Southern Division teams (continuing at level 3) have since played for promotion to this division.\n\nThe feeder divisions of the Combination Women's Football Leagues (1998–2014) became officially part of the WPL system in 2014 at level 4. From these four divisions (North, Midlands, South East and South West), clubs can win promotion to the level 3 National League North or National League South.\n\nThe FA has run the Women's Premier League/National League for most of the competition's existence, but the league was organised in its first two seasons (from 1991 to 1993) by its founders, the Women's Football Association.\n\nFrom its foundation in 1991–92 through until 2012–13, the FA Women's Premier League National Division was above the Northern and Southern divisions running on an equal basis, whose winners each season were promoted to the National Division.\n\nThe terms Women's Premiership and Ladies Premiership were generally used for the National Division only. \n\nThe National Division had been the top tier of women's football from 1991–2010, but was demoted after the creation of the FA Women's Super League in 2011. Following the 2012–13 season, the National Division was scrapped due to the FA's decision to add a second division to the WSL for the 2014 season – WSL 2. (Note that the WSL is a summer league, as opposed to the Premier League's winter format.)\n\nFor the 2014–15 season, the Premier League was restructured to have a second level. To accomplish this, the four Combination Women's Football Leagues were incorporated as the Premier League's new Division 1. At level 3 in the pyramid now is the Northern and Southern division; a level below are four groups of Division One leagues: North, Midlands, South East and South West. In addition, the winners of the Northern and Southern Divisions would play each other in a one-off play-off at a neutral venue for an opportunity to be promoted into the WSL, the first instance of promotion between the WPL and the WSL. The first play-off was contested between Portsmouth and Sheffield F.C. at Stratford FC's ground, with the latter winning through a stoppage time goal.\n\nBelow is a list of women's Premier League National Division champions from 1991–92 until 2012-13.\n\nThe Premier League was run by the Women's Football Association for its first two seasons before being taken over by the FA from the 1993–94 season. (Similarly, the Women's FA Cup, which dates from 1970, was run by the Women's Football Association from 1970–71 to 1991–92 inclusive, and was taken over by the FA from the 1993–94 season.) \n\nLevel 1 national champions\n\nLevel 2 national champions:\n\nFrom 2014, the level 2 national division was FA WSL 2.\n\nCroydon W.F.C. changed their name to Charlton Athletic in the summer of 2000, and competed as Charlton Athletic for 2000–01 and subsequent seasons. \n\nLevel 2:\n\nLevel 3 champions:\n\nFollowing the incorporation of the Combination Women's Football Leagues into the Women's Premier League in 2014, the Women's Premier League consisted of an additional four regional leagues below the Northern and Southern Divisions.\n\nCurrently there are two tiers and a total of six divisions that make up the National League: the two tier 3 divisions, the Northern and Southern divisions, as well as four regional tier 4 divisions: Division One North, Division One Midlands, Division One South East and Division One South West.\n\nIn the 2019–20 season, 24 teams compete in the Premier League (12 teams per division) and 47 teams compete in Division One (12 teams per division except for Division One South East which has 11 following the disbanding of Southampton Saints prior to the start of the season).\nPremier League Northern Division\n\nPremier League Southern Division\n\nDivision One North\n\nDivision One Midlands\n\nDivision One South East\n\nDivision One South West\n\nSeventy-two clubs throughout England and Wales compete in the Women's Premier League, with six divisions of twelve teams, though this number has varied historically due to the changing structure of women's football. Following the formation of the FA Women's Super League, the number of clubs competing in the national division decreased from 12 to 8. Likewise the number of teams in both the Northern and Southern Divisions decreased from 12 to 10, resulting in the total number of team's in the Women's Premier League decreasing from 36 to 28.\n\nFollowing the expansion of the WSL with the addition of a second division, the National League was abolished. As a result, both the Southern and Northern Divisions increased to 11 teams each. Several clubs which had previously been competing in the National Division were moved into the Southern Division including Charlton Athletic, Cardiff City, Portsmouth and Coventry United (formerly Coventry City).\n\nFor the 2014/15 season, the Combination Leagues were incorporated into the newly rebranded FA Women's Premier League, as a result, the WPL now consisted of 72 teams in 6 divisions.\n\nThe main cup competition of the National League is the FA Women's National League Cup, a knock-out competition involving all of the teams within the six divisions that make up the National. Due to the changing structure of women's football, this competition has historically varied from a straight knock-out competition to a competition with a preliminary group stage before reaching the knock-out stage.\n\nDuring the 2014–15 season, the FA Women's National League Plate was introduced. Under the current format, the teams that are eliminated from the opening round of the League Cup are entered into the Plate.\n\n\n\n"}

It was also called the \"Li-Itō Convention\".\n\nFollowing the Gapsin Coup in Joseon in 1884, tensions had been escalating between China and Japan over external influence over the Joseon dynasty of Korea and its royal family. During this coup, the Japanese supported a coup attempt aimed at reforming and modernizing Joseon. The coup plotters sought to eliminate legal enforced social distinctions, eliminating the privileges of the yangban class. The coup failed when China dispatched 1500 soldiers under Yuan Shikai. The Japanese and the coup plotters fled to Japan.\n\nThe driving out of the Japanese soldiers by Chinese troops greatly increased tension between the two powers. Following extensive negotiations, Itō Hirobumi of Japan and Li Hongzhang of China attempted to defuse tensions by signing an agreement whereby:\n\n\nThe Convention effectively eliminated China's claim to exclusive influence over the Joseon dynasty of Korea, and made Joseon a co-protectorate of both China and Japan. Despite negotiations, the Convention was no deterrent to either party, and the next serious confrontation over Joseon quickly escalated into the First Sino-Japanese War. The immediate result was a rise in Chinese influence over Joseon, which appointed Yuan Shikai as a Resident, a director of Joseon affairs (1885–1894).\n\n"}

{"id": "2114707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2114707", "title": "Budapest Stock Exchange", "text": "Budapest Stock Exchange\n\nBudapest Stock Exchange (BSE) () is the 2nd largest stock exchange in Central and Eastern Europe by market capitalization and liquidity. It is located at 7 Liberty Square, Budapest, Hungary, in the central business district of the city, known as District V. Previously, from 1864, during the Austro-Hungarian Empire it was located in the Budapest Stock Exchange Palace building, until a large trading floor was necessary. The exchange is controlled by listed issuers, by Hungarian private investors and by the central bank. The BSE is member of the World Federation of Exchanges and the Federation of European Securities Exchanges.\nThe Budapest Stock Exchange accounts for all the turnover in the Hungarian market and a large share of the Central and Eastern European market. In 2007, BSE agreed to move to abolish floor trading, the trading today takes place via the Xetra system, with redundant floor brokers taking on the role of market-makers. Xetra is the reference market for all exchange trading in Hungarian equities and exchange traded funds. The prices on Xetra serve as the basis for calculating the BUX, the best-known Hungarian share index. Xetra has 60 per cent market share throughout Europe with over 230 trading participants from 18 European countries, plus Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates are connected via Xetra. Xetra trading at Budapest runs from 09:00 to 17:00 with closing auction from 17:00-17:05, and post-trading trading times until 17:20. BSE was introduced a pre market trading from 08:15 to 08:30 and an opening auction call from 08:30 to 09:00.\n\nThe Exchange's organisation, internal trading supervision, implementation of the Board's decisions, publication of information on the exchange and the Exchange's overall business administration are duties of the Chief Executive Officer. The Exchange shall comply with the principles established by the Capital Market Act and shall ensure that investment service providers trading on the Exchange, issuers and investors should have the power to issue their opinion while equally participating in the decision-making process affecting the Exchange. In order to ensure this, the Exchange operates committees for the representation of interests. Committee members are elected by traders and issuers, and their mandates expire at the same time as the mandates of the Board of the Exchange.\nThe \"Trading Committee\" formulates the professional view of the vendors, represents vendors’ interests in professional issues and ensures the institutional possibility of professional control of decisions. The \"Committee of Issuers\" formulates the professional view of the issuers, represents issuers’ interests in professional issues and ensures the institutional possibility of professional control of decisions. The \"representative promoting investors’ interests\" is authorized to issue an opinion on all proposals concerning the interests of investors. The representative is elected by the organisations and associations representing investors’ interests. The \"Settlement Committee\" participates in the preparation of decisions regarding the Exchange's settlement system and ensures effective professional oversight. Its members and Chairman are elected by the BSE Board based on vendor recommendations. The \"Index Committee\" was set up to oversee the expansion and ongoing maintenance of the BSE's main indexes. In addition, it is charged with developing and publishing the Exchange's other indicators. The members of the Committee are independent market experts appointed by the Board of Directors.\n\nListing of equity series takes place on Prime, Standard or T Markets. In September 2017, BSE also launched a market tailored to medium-sized companies called Xtend. For listing on the T Market, in addition to the above general requirements, which are basically requirements of the law, the Exchange does not impose further conditions. On the Standard Market, in addition to the basic requirements of the law, BSE prescribes a public transaction to be carried out, with regard to the equity series to be listed. In case admission is sought to the Prime Market, the company and the series of securities to be listed shall comply with certain further requirements (size of the series, free float, completed business years, etc.). A public transaction, involving the securities series to be listed is mandatory on the Prime Market as well, however, in this category, issuers may request a one-year postponement to fulfill this obligation.\nOn the Exchange, the right to trade is ensured exclusively for persons to whom the Exchange has given the respective licence, the so-called trading licence. Investors can realize their deals on the exchange through these exchange-trading companies. Exchange trading takes place in sections, at present there are four such sections: equities section, debt securities section, derivatives section, commodity section.\n\nCurrent exchange trading members are provided here: \"List of Exchange Members\"\n\nTrading at the Budapest Stock Exchange is governed by clear rules, which apply equally for all trading participants. Independent market surveillance is made by Hungarian National Bank’s Market Supervision Board. It holds primary responsibility for enforcing the securities laws, proposing securities rules, and regulating the securities industry, the country's stock and options exchanges, and other activities and organizations, including the electronic securities markets in Hungary.\n\nWith a view to improving the continuity of prices and to avoid mistrades, several protective mechanisms are in place for the trading venues Xetra and Budapest Stock Exchange. These include volatility interruption, market order interruption, and liquidity interruption measures.\n\nThe Hungarian Stock Exchange, the ancestor of today's Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) started its operation on 18 January 1864 in Pest on the banks of the Danube, in a building of the Lloyd Insurance Company. The committee in charge of setting up the exchange was led by Frigyes Kochmeister, who was also elected as the first chairman of the exchange (1864–1900). When the exchange was launched in 1864, there were 17 equities, one debenture, 11 foreign currencies and 9 bills of exchange listed. After a few years of slow growth, 1872 saw the first significant market boom, when the Minister of Trade approved the articles of incorporation of 15 industrial and 550 financial companies whose shares were then listed on the exchange. The BSCE moved into a new building in 1873 and until 1905 continued its operations in a building on the corner of Wurm Street (now Szende Pál Street). In 1905 it relocated to the Exchange Palace on Liberty Square.\n\nThe first real market crash of the exchange occurred in May 1873. The early 1890s marked another period of spectacular market boom in the exchange's history, partially fuelled by a general investment optimism that was characteristic of the Millennium years, and by recent trends in the international stock markets. Following 1889 the stock prices of companies listed on the Budapest Stock Exchange were also published in Vienna, Frankfurt, London and Paris. From the 1890s Hungarian government bonds were regularly traded on the stock exchanges of London, Paris, Amsterdam and Berlin.\n\nBy the turn of the century, there were already 310 securities traded on the exchange; by the beginning of World War I, this increased to almost 500. The annual turnover in 1913 reached one million shares and the turnover of the Budapest Giro and Mutual Society amounted to 2.7 billion Crowns (the ancestor of the Forint). At the same time there was also a dynamic expansion in grain trading with almost 400,000 tons in 1875, growing to one million tons by the turn of the century and close to one and a half million tons by WWI. As a result of this expansion the BSCE was propelled to become the leading grain exchange in Europe.\n\nAs in most European countries, the outbreak of World War I brought about the exchange's closure on 27 July 1914, although trading did not cease. Brokers continued trading during the war and equity prices showed a massive increase starting in 1914. By 1918 over 7.2 million securities had been traded in a year. The exchange reopened after the war were, the post-war inflationary environment pushed exchange turnover to exceptional highs, tempered only by the introduction in 1925 of the country's new currency, the pengő. The following four years leading to the market crash of the New York Stock Exchange in October 1929 saw the downturn of the BSCE. On 14 July 1931, the BSCE was closed down again as a result of a German banking moratorium and a series of financial collapses of the continent's major banks. Bond trading officially resumed only in 1932, followed by trading in the 18 most traded equities. Following a short period of recovery, the market entered an expansionary phase in 1934, reaching its peak in 1936.\n\nWhen Hungary entered World War II, the exchange saw a period of unprecedented boom, and equity prices in the heavy and military industries increased manifold. In 1942 the government applied stricter measures for the BSCE articles of incorporation and set maximum values on daily price changes. Despite these restrictions the exchange was able to continue its operations until the start of the city's siege in mid-December 1944. World War II was followed by a period of hyperinflation, characterized by a lively private stock and real exchange trading in currencies and precious metals, conducted partially in the damaged building of the exchange. The exchange officially re-opened in August 1946, following the launch of the forint on August 1. As companies defaulted on their payments of bonds issued previously in the crown and pengő currencies, and since limited companies failed to pay dividends on their stocks due to the war damages they suffered, prices kept falling. Two months after the 1948 nationalisation of the majority of private Hungarian firms, the government officially dissolved the Budapest Stock and Commodity Exchange, and the exchange's assets became state property.\n\nThe first milestone in the re-open of Budapest Stock Exchange was the Government of Hungary’s decision to give green light for the preparation of the Securities Act of 1989. The draft bill was submitted to Parliament in January 1990 and came into force on 1 March. At the same time that the bill came into force on 21 June 1990, the BSE held its statutory general meeting and the Exchange re-opened its doors. With 41 founding members and one single equity, IBUSZ, the Budapest Stock Exchange was set up as a sui generis organisation, an independent legal entity. The re-establishment of the market economy during the same time and the privatisation of businesses played a decisive role in the exchange’s operations. Even though the sale of the larger state-owned businesses often involved the assistance of strategic investors, the BSE played a significant role in the privatisation of many leading Hungarian companies including Rába, MOL Group, OTP Bank, Magyar Telekom, Danubius Hotels Group, Richter Gedeon Co., IBUSZ, Skála-Coop, Globus and more.\n\nThe first trading floor was in the Trade Center on Váci Street, followed by its move in 1992 to the atmospheric old building at Deák Ferenc Street in Belváros-Lipótváros, where it continued its operations for 15 years. In March, 2007 the BSE moved to the former Herczog Palace at 93 Andrássy Avenue. The Open outcry system of the physical trading floor that characterized the spot market functioned with partial electronic support until 1995. From 1995 until November, 1998 securities trading took place concurrently on the trading floor and in a remote trading system, when the new MultiMarket Trading System (MMTS), based entirely on remote trading was launched. The traditional “battlefield rumble” of the physical trading floor ceased within a year by September 1999, at which time physical trading was entirely replaced by the electronic remote trading platform of the derivatives market. Derivatives market of the BSE in futures and options contracts has been available to investors since 1995. BUX contracts have been available for trading since the start of the futures market on 31 March 1995. In July, 1998 the BSE was among the first exchanges in the world to introduce contracts based on individual equities. Another series of standardised derivatives in the options market appeared in February, 2000 and on 6 September 2004 trading commenced in the exchange's second index, the BUMIX. In January, 2010, BSE became a member of the CEE Stock Exchange Group.\n\nOn 6 December 2013, on the occasion of the exchange's new trading platform launch the stock exchange trading was ceremonially opened by Mihály Varga, Minister of National Economy. That day the new Xetra trading system replaced the system that has been in use for 15 years. In February 2015 the BSE moved to new premises in Liberty Square. The current offices of BSE are located in the financial centre of Budapest, near to the historical Exchange Palace. On 20 November 2015 the Hungarian National Bank concluded a sales contract with the Austrian CEESEG AG and Österreichische Kontrollbank AG, the entities that to date held a 68.8 per cent ownership in BSE.\n\nThe Stock Exchange Advisory Board was founded in 2016. With 16 members, the body is responsible for preparing, establishing and commenting on BSE's strategic and business decisions.\n\n\n"}

His mother died early and Richard claimed to have spent much of his upbringing with foster parents.\n\nFor seven years in his youth Whiteing was apprenticed to Benjamin Wyon as a medalist and seal-engraver; meanwhile he was also educating himself on the side. In 1866, after a failed attempt to start his own medalist business, he turned to journalism as a career. He made his debut with a series of papers in the \"Evening Star\" in 1866, printed separately in the next year as \"Mr Sprouts, His Opinions\". He became leader-writer and correspondent on the \"Morning Star\", and was subsequently on the staff of the \"Manchester Guardian\", the \"New York World\", and for many years the \"Daily News\", resigning from the last-named paper in 1899.\n\nHis first novel \"The Democracy\" (3 vols, 1876) was published under the pseudonym of Whyte Thorne. His second novel \"The Island\" (1888) was about a utopian life on Pitcairn Island; it attracted little attention until, years afterwards, its successor, \"No. 5 John Street\" (1899), made him famous; the earlier novel was then republished. \"No. 5 John Street\" has the character from the first novel return to London, but has no money, and describes the low-life of London. Later works were \"The Yellow Van\" (1903), \"Ring in the New\" (1906), \"All Moonshine\" (1907).\n\nWhiteing died 29 June 1928 in Hampstead and is buried in the Parish Church of St. John-at-Hampstead, Church Row, London near his son Richard Clifford (1870–1923).\n\nWhiteing's autobiography, \"My Harvest\", written in 1915, led many to believe he was an only child, whose mother had died in the 1840s when he was quite young. However family historian, Kathleen Whiteing Fitzgerald, revealed that Whiteing actually had three siblings. There were two brothers, Robert & George, who had both lived well into adulthood and a sister Elizabeth who died as an infant. Fitzgerald noted that in the 1861 London census Whiteing, then 20 years old, was listed as living with both of his parents and his younger brother George. Richard's father, William, died in Beverley in 1876, and his mother died in Kensington in 1884.\n\nIn 1869 Whiteing married Helen Watson Harris (1848-1921), the ward/niece of Townsend Harris, US Ambassador to Japan. To their marriage was born an only child in 1872, Richard Clifford Whiteing. Their son married Ellen Marie Louise \"Nell\" DuMaurier in 1908, the niece of illustrator and novelist George Du Maurier and cousin of actor Gerald Du Maurier.\n\nAfter Whiteing's separation from Helen, he lived for many years with journalist and children's author Alice Corkran. He was also friends with her sister Henriette, who wrote an intimate account of him in her \"Celebrities and I\".\n"}

It is accessible by road and rail from Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, and it is the northernmost point on National Route 1A.\n\nDue to its geography as Vietnam's gateway to China, Lạng Sơn and its ancient citadel have been in the path of many invasions, and were the site of three French defeats during the colonial era. Occupied by Qing forces during the military buildup that preceded the Sino-French War, the city was occupied by France after the two-week Lạng Sơn Campaign in February 1885. However, the brigade there conducted a hasty retreat after a failed attack at the Battle of Bang Bo into China; the \"retreat from Lạng Sơn\" became the most controversial aspect of the war and led to the fall of Jules Ferry's ministry. Outnumbered French colonial forces clashed with the Japanese 5th Division in the Battle of Lạng Sơn during the Japanese Vietnam Expedition on 22 September 1940. The French were again compelled to retreat hastily. In 1945 it was again the scene of heavy fighting during the Japanese coup d'état in French Indochina.\n\nAfter the end of the Pacific War, the French colonial army established a permanent garrison there, which served as the logistics hub for the French border fortresses. It was evacuated in 1950 during Võ Nguyên Giáp's offensive against the French border forts, considered a turning point in the Indochina War. The city was the center of fighting during the Sino-Vietnamese War of 1979, and sustained extensive damage. \n\nThe surface rocks in the area are a Permian limestone, overlain by the early Triassic Lang Son Formation, consisting of flyschoid beds with interbedded sandstones, siltstones and clay shales and some felsic volcanics.\n\n"}

The school was established on 8 January 1849 by the Bishop of Cape Town, \nThe institution consists of three schools: the college for grades 8 – 12; the preparatory school for grades 3 – 7, and the pre-preparatory school for grades N-2.\n\nThe college is on Campground Road at the main campus, and a small portion of this land is used for the pre-preparatory school. The Preparatory School is situated in Fir Road, Rondebosch close to the college campus.\n\nThe college has eight houses: Founders, School and White are the boarding houses, and Birt, Gray, Kidd, Mallett and Ogilvie are for day-scholars. Each house has about 70 to 100 students, and is governed by a house director and an assistant director. The houses are further broken down into tutor groups of about 15 to 20 boys (three or four boys per grade). Each house is equipped with a common room, kitchen, study room, matric room, quad, dining hall, and offices for the head of house and house directors. The preparatory school has four houses: Van der Bijl (for boarders and day-boys), Bramley, Brooke and Charlton. \nThe institution also offers a dynamic and global alumni organisation, the Old Diocesan Union which has over 5,000 active members in 28 branches around the world.\n\nBishops is renowned as one of the top schools in the country for its academics. It has consistently ranked within the top 10 schools in the country for Matric, and as one of the top schools in the Western Cape.\n\nBishops is one of four schools in the world to offer an annual Rhodes Scholarship to an ex-pupil to attend the University of Oxford, having been part of the initial Rhodes Scholarship experiment. The school now shares the scholarship with ex-pupils of Herschel School, St. Cyprian's School, and LEAP Schools.\n\nThe original HA Molteno Library (which was initially funded by Harry Anderson Molteno as part of the 125th anniversary of Bishops) was designed by Maciek Miszewski and opened in 1977, before which the library had been housed in the Brooke Chapel. It was recently renovated in 2013 to provide a modern, academic, and cultural hub central to the school grounds. Known still as The Molteno Library, the centre provides digital, written and social resources to expand and enhance learning beyond the classroom and the curriculum. The new entrance opens up the library into the History and English quad, just behind the Memorial Chapel, positioning it as a focal point within the academic precinct of the school. The library consists of three floors and four areas - social and research, learning, reading, and \"indaba\".\n\nIn 2018, a new trans-disciplinary curriculum was introduced for Grade 9 students called Big Ideas, focusing on sustainability and promoting critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. The curriculum was based off the framework of the UN Sustainable Development Goals as a way for students to learn about global issues, and culminated in a project undertaken by all students that tackled an aspect of a global issue.\n\nThe school offers numerous opportunities to high-performing students for growth. The school enters boys annually into a number of prestigious competitions such as the UCT Mathematics Competition and the South African Mathematics Olympiad, and many students often qualify for the provincial or national Mathematics teams. The school also participates in the Eskom Science Expo, with many students progressing to prestigious fairs such as ISEF. Senior boys write the National Science Olympiads, with students regularly breaking top 10 in the country, or even winning outright. Bishops further offers the Nexus program for academically talented boys, where they are given leave for certain classes for more advanced pursuits. \n\nA key component of Bishops is providing a well-rounded education, and hence cultural activities are a very important part of the school. \n\nMusic plays an integral role in the daily life of all boys at Bishops – from daily Chapel Services to the annual Eisteddfod. Many would consider the Eisteddfod, which takes place in the last week of the second term, to be the most important. Over two days the skills of the boys in all spheres of music, art, drama, speech and debating are contested as the Houses compete for the coveted Eisteddfod Owls. It is a showcase of the talent in the school while also uniting the students in an atmosphere of camaraderie and fun. In the drama section a major play production takes place in either the first or second term each year, while in September a one-act play festival is held. The aim is to encourage and stimulate a musical interest in all boys who attend the school, whether it is from just hearing music daily to actually playing an instrument and being part of a musical ensemble. The Bishops Pops takes place tri-annually and throughout the year several art exhibitions display the talent in visual arts, digital design and photography while musical concerts present the work of the ensembles such as the orchestra, chapel choir and choir, jazz band, wind ensemble, brass band and marimba band.\n\nThe John Peake Music School underwent extensive renovations during 2002. It now houses two well-equipped teaching classrooms, five offices for the full-time staff, nine instrumental teaching rooms, a dedicated percussion studio, a staff room, two dedicated practice rooms, the Hyslop Concert Hall, a recording studio, a SoundHouse for music technology and two store rooms.\n\nThere are over 30 societies presently functioning at the College. These societies are run by members of staff, with the assistance of senior boys. \n\nAll Bishops pupils are expected to belong to at least one of these societies, depending on their interests and opportunities, and most are very well attended. Each society can hold meetings from every week to two or three times per term, either in the evenings, after lunch, or during Open Period - a free block that every boy has during the day. Some, such as the Public Speaking and Debating societies, are world renowned, and several boys represent or have represented the national team in this regard. \n\nThe current list of societies include:\n\n\nThe first concerns a teacher, Leonard Kaplan, who was accused of inappropriate conduct toward students. He was ultimately asked to resign from the school. One report in the media stated \"similar allegations had been made against Kaplan 19 years earlier but he had been allowed to stay on at the school\".\n\nIn March 2000 five matric boarders were expelled having been found guilty of beating about twenty Grade 9 and Grade 10 students in a hazing 'raid'. Fourteen months prior two boys were also victims of hazing. The school has publicly committed to eradicating the culture of bullying at the school.\n\nIn October 2019 a teacher and water polo coach was accused of having a sexual relationship with a pupil. The teacher has since resigned from the school and the investigation is ongoing.\n\n \n\n\n"}

{"id": "2114785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2114785", "title": "Peter Ndlovu", "text": "Peter Ndlovu\n\nPeter Ndlovu (born 25 February 1973) is a Zimbabwean former professional footballer and is currently the Team Manager at Mamelodi Sundowns F.C. a Premier Soccer League club in South Africa.\n\nPeter Ndlovu originally comes from Binga district in North Western, Siabuwa Zimbabwe. He was however born in Bulawayo, and played professionally as a striker from 1988 until 2011. He played for Highlanders in Zimbabwe, for Coventry City in the Premier League and in the Football League for Birmingham City, Huddersfield Town and Sheffield United. In South Africa he played for Mamelodi Sundowns, Thanda Royal Zulu, Highfield United and Black Mambas. He was capped 100 times by his country, scoring 38 international goals.\n\nNdlovu was originally spotted by John Sillett, prior to his official signing from Highlanders by Terry Butcher in July 1991. He made an immediate impact by scoring away at Arsenal and then became the toast of Highfield Road with a thunderbolt winner against Aston Villa in November 1991, endearing him to the Sky Blues fans.\n\nAlthough he would go on to play a major role at several clubs in the Championship, it is his time at Coventry he is particularly known for given the club's top flight status at that time. He would play a significant role in two major teams, Bobby Gould's attacking team of 1992/93 and the expansive squad of the mid and late 1990s, during which time Ron Atkinson and then Gordon Strachan managed the club. Bobby Gould's team in 1992–93 are widely regarded as under-achievers, finishing 15th in the first Premier League season, having spent much of the season in considerably higher positions.\n\nOn 19 August 1992, Ndlovu made history by being the first African footballer to play in the new English Premier League. Having acquired striker Micky Quinn in November 1992 they continued what had already been a blistering start, with away wins at Tottenham Hotspur (2–0) Sheffield Wednesday (2–1) and Wimbledon (2–1) to add to already impressive home wins against Middlesbrough (2–1). By the early autumn the Sky Blues briefly topped the inaugural Premier League and would only lose five league games prior to Christmas. The addition of Micky Quinn to the squad led to further outstanding home wins against Aston Villa (3–0) and Liverpool (5–1). In February 1993, they won 4-2 against title chasing, big spending Blackburn Rovers. However, a barren final few weeks of the season and a run in that would see back to back games against Man United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Leeds United saw them slip from fifth in the league in February to 15th in the final table. The season finished with a thrilling performance from Ndlovu in a 3–3 draw against Leeds United. Ndlovu was a key component throughout the season in Gould's fast pacey front line which included John Williams, Kevin Gallacher (until his departure to Blackburn) and Robert Rosario, who formed a worthy partnership with Micky Quinn. Ndlovu's goal against Norwich City, in a 1–1 draw in late September, was a signature piece of Ndlovu flair which earned him the Match of Day 'Goal of the month' competition.\n\nThe 1993–94 season would see a managerial shift in the autumn as Gould resigned and was succeeded by his assistant Phil Neal - but not before the legendary curtain raiser to the second Premier League season. Bobby Gould's first day gamble would be to play without traditional full backs. This novel formation gave Ndlovu full licence to play a large part in a memorable opening day triumph in the capital. The 3–0 victory at Highbury over Arsenal saw Micky Quinn score a hat-trick in front of the newly refurbished North Bank. It also ensured that the Sky Blues made one of their customary lightning starts to the season, so synonymous of this era. After an early Ian Wright threat on the Coventry goal, it was Ndlovu who made a darting run into the Arsenal penalty box which produced a clumsy challenge from Lee Dixon. The resulting penalty was calmly converted by Micky Quinn for the opener. The second half would see Ndlovu and Roy Wegerle lead the Gunners defence a merry dance, Wegerle in particular enjoying possibly his finest game for the club. So shocked were Arsenal by the 3–0 defeat that manager George Graham cancelled the proposed post-match lap of honour at the final whistle, which was to parade their League Cup and FA Cup silverware. The explanation given by Arsenal was 'Reasons beyond the club's control!'. It is reported that Coventry rejected a £4million offer from Arsenal for Ndlovu during the 1993-94 season - a deal which would have made Ndlovu the most expensive player signed by an English club. The dramatic resignation of Bobby Gould, after a 5–1 mauling at Loftus Road in October 1993, was reputedly inspired by the possible imminent sale of Ndlovu to a top six club.\n\nHowever, Ndlovu stayed but the 11th-place finish secured that season was not repeated in the 1994–95 campaign. Phil Neal was replaced by Ron Atkinson in February. Big Ron was credited with saving the club from relegation in the spring of 1995, and brought in Gordon Strachan as his assistant. This second significant phase for Ndlovu would once again promise much - the 'new era' of big money signings heralded by Atkinson's appointment saw the arrival of Huckerby, Whelan, Salako and McAllister together with Neal's £2million signing Dion Dublin. Big Ron provided vital impetus early on, but the following season his stylish and classy team sheet rarely 'clicked' in the traditional sense. However, Ndlovu still scored some memorable goals for the Sky Blues during this period, including the first away player to secure a hat-trick at Anfield for 30 years. Other memorable goals in Sky Blue included a vital winning goal away at Wimbledon in a relegation six-pointer and a dynamic last minute rifling winner in a 3rd Round FA Cup tie at West Bromwich Albion.\n\nNdlovu gradually suffered due to inconsistency. The large and expansive side Gordon Strachan inherited, well equipped with attacking options, saw fierce competition for places from Whelan, Huckerby, Salako and Telfer. An increasingly cosmopolitan Premier league too would eventually see Coventry turn to Steve Froggatt and Moroccan internationals Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo in the years following Ndlovu's departure. He was known as 'Nuddy' by Coventry City fans and his other nicknames being 'The Bulawayo Bullet' and \"'Nsukuzonke\"' an isiNdebele word referring to his ability to turn on the style everytime/day he played.\n\nNdlovu eventually moved to Birmingham City in July 1997, signed by Trevor Francis for a fee of £1.6m. Ndlovu is generally considered a success by Blues fans, despite failing to reach the Premiership whilst \"Nuddy\" was in their ranks. Ndlovu's old-school wing play helped propel the Blues to two successive play-off appearances in Nationwide Division One, though both appearances would ultimately end in semi-final defeats. He spent time on loan at Huddersfield Town in December 2000, where he scored twice on his debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Upon returning to Birmingham he helped them beat Ipswich Town in the semi-final of the 2000-01 League Cup. However, before the final he was released to join Sheffield United in February 2001.\n\nNdlovu also enjoyed success at Sheffield United and was known to their fans as 'Nuddy'. With him playing on the right side of midfield, United managed to get to two semi-finals of major cup competitions, in addition to the final of the Championship (formerly Division 1) play-offs in the 2002–03 season.\n\nHe scored the winning goal against Leeds United in the 2002 Worthington Cup competition and scored a hat-trick against Cardiff City in 2003–04. He left the Blades in the summer of 2004 having scored 25 goals in 135 league games. In all, Ndlovu scored more than 90 goals during his 12 seasons and 338 appearances in the top two flights of the English football league.\n\nNdlovu signed for South African Premier Soccer League outfit Mamelodi Sundowns during the 2004 off-season. Thanda Royal Zulu made one of their major signings before transfer window closed on the day by bringing former Mamelodi Sundowns striker Ndlovu on board. Ndlovu was released from his contract by Thanda Royal Zulu at the end of 2008–09 after they were relegated from South Africa's top division. He stayed for two years without playing football.\n\nIn 2011 Ndlovu became the assistant manager of the Zimbabwe national football team.\n\nPeter's brothers, Adam and Madinda, were also international players. The brothers played on the streets of Makokoba, Zimbabwe, where they grew up. Peter also played in both his primary (Lotshe Primary) and secondary (Mzilikazi) schools and his hometown team Highlanders before joining Coventry in 1991.\n\nHis surname is commonly mispronounced by British commentators and, as a result, fans as well. Throughout his career, he was referred to as 'Und-luv', when in fact, the pronunciation of his surname is closer to 'End-lo-vu'.\n\nNdlovu was left in a \"critical\" condition in hospital after a car crash near the Victoria Falls Airport in Zimbabwe on 16 December 2012. Ndlovu's BMW X5 had suffered a tyre blow out which caused it to come off the road and hit a tree. He suffered internal injuries, head injuries, broken ribs and a broken leg whilst his brother Adam, and a female passenger were killed. Ndlovu subsequently faced trial the following March for culpable homicide, with the prosecution claiming he was responsible for failing to control his car properly. He was acquitted in April 2013, with the court citing a lack of evidence to prove Ndlovu's responsibility.\n\n"}

Noted novelist Julio Cortázar was his classmate there, and remained a longtime friend. Since his childhood he was an ardent supporter of San Lorenzo de Almagro. He married fellow mathematician and activist Cora Ratto de Sadosky (1912–1981) in 1937. Biographer Pablo Jacovkis has said that Cora, had a \"powerful personality [that] was not overshadowed by her husband's.\" The couple had one child, mathematician Cora Sadosky (1940–2010).\n\nSadosky graduated as a Doctor in Physics and Mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires in 1940, under supervision of Esteban Terradas. He then moved to the Henri Poincaré Institute in Paris to pursue postdoctoral studies on a scholarship granted by the French Government. After another year in Italy, he returned to Argentina, where he faced complicated employment options because of his opposition to the Peronist regime.\n\nAfter a coup d'état of 1955 removed President Juan Perón from office, Sadosky took up a position as professor at the University of Buenos Aires, where he was vice-dean of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences from 1957 to 1966.\n\nIn 1960 he was commissioned to develop the \"Computational Institute\" (\"Instituto de Cálculo\") of the university, home of \"Clementina,\" a new Ferranti Mercury computer and the first one installed in Argentina for research and education. His staff there included several excellent mathematicians including Cecilia Berdichevsky and Rebeca Cherep de Guber, and both would work closely with him for many years to come. \n\nHe directed the institute until another coup d'état installed a military dictatorship in 1966, causing him to resign with the rest of the faculty in opposition to government intervention in the hitherto autonomous state universities (the Night of the Big Sticks) and flee the country. \n\nHe was later able to return to Argentina, but the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance death squad threatened to kill him so he fled with his family in 1974. He moved to Uruguay, finding employment in Montevideo at the Universidad de la República, where he continued publishing, helped to initiate computer studies and introduced the first research computer in that country.\n\nWith the eventual return of democracy to Argentina in 1983, president Raúl Alfonsín appointed him as Secretary of State of Science and Technology (until 1989).\n\nOne of his major contributions to computer science during this period, was the creation of the ESLAI (Latin American School of Higher Informatics).\n\nDr. Manuel Sadosky died in Buenos Aires on June 18, 2005.\n\nHe was named an Illustrious Citizen of the City of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe Computer Science Department of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires is named after him.\n\n\n"}

It is a part of the Washoe County School District. The school's teams are known as the Reno Huskies, and the school colors are red and blue.\n\nReno High was the first high school in Reno, which is celebrated by its slogan: \"Reno High - Older than Reno\".\n\nHigh school students in Reno in the 1860s were originally taught in the basement of a building on the corner of First and Virginia Streets, on the future site of the Mapes Hotel. Today there is a city plaza at that location, which is across the street from the Reno City Hall. In 1869 High school students were moved to a one-room school. In 1879, due to Reno's expanding population, a larger high school, called \"Central School,\" was built near Arlington and Fourth Streets. This was commonly referred to as \"Reno High School\", and 1879 is the generally accepted year of the school's founding.\n\nIn 1910 a fire in the chemistry lab destroyed the school's main building. The school was rebuilt in downtown Reno in 1912, at a location formerly occupied by the Sundowner Casino.\n\nIn 1951, Reno High was moved to new facilities on located on Booth and Foster Streets, just south of the Truckee River and near Idlewild Park.\n\nReno High has won numerous state championships in many sports. The boys' cross country team has been the most dominant, winning 11 state championships (including five consecutive wins). The girls' basketball team won the state championship in 2001, then won back-to-back state and region championships in 2013 and 2014. The Reno High football team won the Nevada state football title in 2003, the Reno baseball team won the state championship in 2004 and the boys' basketball team won the championship in 2006, knocking off North Las Vegas' Rancho High School.\n\nThe Reno Huskies compete in the High Desert League of the Northern Nevada 4A Region, which is the large-school level in Nevada.\n\nSince 2003, the Reno High boys' sports varsity teams have won Nevada state championships in football, basketball, baseball, track and field, swimming, diving, tennis, and snow skiing.\n\nOn Friday, February 22, 2008, the Reno Huskies defeated Cheyenne High of Las Vegas 76 to 72 for their second state basketball championship in three seasons. The Huskies won at least one state championship in seven different sports in every year from 2002 to 2008.\n\nReno High football placekicker Dirk Borgognone set a world record for the longest high school football field goal in 1986. The 68 yard long field goal, which was kicked in a game at Sparks High School is the second-longest in organized American football at any class level, just short of Ove Johansson's 69-yard field goal in 1976, for NAIA college school Abilene Christian.\n\nReno High cross country runner Marie (Mel) Lawrence holds the U.S. high school record in the 2,000 m and 3,000 m steeplechase.\n\nReno currently has three performing orchestras:\n\n\nThe Chamber Orchestra tours each year, participating in college level master-classes and festivals at schools and Universities such as Stanford University, San Francisco State University, San Jose State University and University of the Pacific. Members of the Orchestras audition for and consistently participate in the Reno Philharmonic Youth Symphonies, the Washoe County Honor Orchestra and the Nevada State Honor Orchestra.\n\n\nThe Jazz Band, Wind Ensemble and Concert Band are ranked highly in the district, winning festivals year round.\n\n\nThe Reno High School Theater Program, known as the Booth Street Players, presents three to four shows a year, along with outside school community performances. The fall production is a play, and the spring production is a musical. Past shows have included \"Little Shop of Horrors\", \"Our Town\", \"Grease\", \"The Boy Friend\", and \"Pippin\" (the last of which included students trained in silk aerial acrobatics).\n\nSpeech and Debate has consecutively won the state championship for 24 years in a row (as of 2019)\n\nThere are many clubs as well offered at Reno High\n\nPublications\n\n\n\n"}

The location also encompasses Clifton Grove and Clifton Village, a residential area set alongside the River Trent. \n\nThe Manor of Clifton was for many centuries the seat of the \"de Clifton\" (later \"Clifton\") family, branches of which were in the 17th century created Baron Clifton of Leighton Bromswold (1608) and Clifton baronets (1611). It is now the site of a council estate. The village is also notable for many old buildings including Clifton Hall, former seat of the Clifton family, and St. Mary's Church.\n\nThe manor of Clifton was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as having a church and a mill. The value of the manor had decreased since the Norman Conquest of 1066 from £16 to £9. For 700 years the Clifton family of Clifton owned the manor, of which their manor house was Clifton Hall. The papers of the Clifton family and their lands are held at Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham.\n\nPrior to Clifton being subsumed into the city, the area was previously within a civil parish called Clifton With Glapton until 1952, Glapton being a small scattering of houses and farms prior to when the estate was built, and was in the area approximately where present day Glapton Lane is, there still being some older houses that predate the estate along the lane.\n\nThe council estate has a number of shop-clusters and relatively good transport links (by tram and bus) with the city (~20 minutes) and surrounding areas. The village is on the A453 road which is the main connection between Nottingham and the M1 motorway south. The section of the A453 from Kegworth to the roundabout next to the \"Crusader\" pub has been upgraded to dual carriageway, this project was completed by 2016.\n\nThe Clifton Council Estate is a sprawling conurbation, which was first considered for residential construction in 1950 by Act of Parliament, and at one time the largest council estate in Europe. The majority of the houses are made of \"no fines\" concrete (concrete which only has large aggregate included). This leaves air filled voids which add thermal insulation. Since the 1980s most of the houses have passed from council to private ownership. Clifton (like some of Nottingham's other estates) has benefited in recent years from redevelopment and regeneration work initiated by the city council. The most recent is a walled community for the elderly opposite the junction of Gotham Road and Farnborough Road called Lark Hill Village which opened to residents in August 2009. There are currently plans for housing on farm land south of Clifton, to be known as Fairham Pastures.\n\nLocal government matters are administered by Nottingham City Council, a unitary authority.\nClifton is split into two wards:\n\nParliamentary, Clifton falls within the Nottingham South constituency, with Lilian Greenwood (Labour) the current Member of Parliament.\n\nPrimary schools include The Milford Academy, Glapton, Whitegate, Highbank, Dovecote (an amalgamation of Greencroft, Brooksby and Brinkhill) and Blessed Robert Widmerpool (Catholic). The Farnborough Academy on Farnborough Road is the mainstream secondary school for the area, while Nethergate School on Swansdowne Drive is an all-through special school. The Nottingham Trent University has one of its campuses on Clifton Lane (A453). On Farnborough Road is also one of the Central College Nottingham campuses.\n\nOn what is now wasteland, accessible from Brooksby Lane or Silverdale Walk, remain the foundations of the original Brooksby School, which was burnt down in the early 1980s. \"Brooksby school\" was then moved to the location now known as \"Dovecote School\" taking a building originally a part of \"Greencroft School\".\n\nClifton has six football teams: Clifton All Whites, Clifton Aces, Clifton Blacks, Clifton Wanderers, Clifton FC and FC Olympico.\n\nMost famous football players are Viv Anderson, Jermaine Jenas and Darren Huckerby\n\nClifton Playing fields, behind Farnborough School, off Farnborough Road hosts Clifton parkrun, that is a 5k timed run. The run was launched in January 2018, and is run on a mixture of trail paths and grass. Some sections of the course may accumulate mud, leaves and puddles after rain. The start and finish are located behind the pavilion building and are a short walk from the car park. The course follows the perimeter of two Clifton playing fields and alongside Fairham Brook. The route is run mainly on grass and consists of two full anticlockwise laps of the perimeter and a further short lap of part of the large playing field. For more information on Clifton parkrun click here.\n\nClifton is the terminus of line 2 of the Nottingham Express Transit tramway, which opened in August 2015. The line runs from a terminus at a park and ride site just to the west of Clifton, through Clifton, Wilford, and Nottingham City Centre, before continuing to Phoenix Park in the north of the city. Trams run at frequencies that vary between 4 and 8 trams per hour, depending on the day and time of day. The following stops are in, or near to, Clifton:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is 6'2\" and weighs 220 pounds. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox, Kansas City Royals, Detroit Tigers and Baltimore Orioles.\n\nBetemit is a 1996 graduate of Jurczak High School, where he played baseball. He was signed as an undrafted free agent shortstop by the Atlanta Braves on July 28, 1996 when he was 14 and a half years old. According to Major League Baseball's age restrictions regarding the signing of minors, teams are not allowed to sign anyone under the age of sixteen. Because of this rule violation, the Braves were fined $100,000 and prohibited from scouting and signing players from the Dominican Republic for six months in 2000.\n\nHe began his professional career in 1997 with the Gulf Coast Braves.\n\nIn 1999, he was the Player of the Year for the Danville Braves of the Rookie League, and Appalachian League All-Star shortstop after batting .320 in 67 games, though he made 33 errors in 67 games.\n\nIn 2000, with the Jamestown Jammers, he hit .331 and was named the Braves' # 1 Minor League Prospect by \"Baseball America\", as well as the Short-Season A Player of the Year and All-Star shortstop.\n\nBetemit started 2001 with the Myrtle Beach Pelicans in Advanced-A ball (hitting the first inside-the-park home run in Pelicans history on June 11), and was promoted mid-season to the Greenville Braves in AA. He hit .355 with Greenville, and was named the Braves top prospect for the second year in a row. He was also the Braves Minor League Player of the Year, the Florida State League All-Star shortstop, and the \"Baseball America\" 2nd team minor league all-star shortstop.\n\nCalled up to the Braves in September, he made his major league debut on September 18, 2001, as a pinch runner against the Philadelphia Phillies. He was 0 for 8 for the Braves in limited pinch hitting opportunities.\n\nIn 2002, he was sent to the AAA Richmond Braves to start the season, but spent significant portions of the season on the disabled list due to various ailments. Despite a sub-par, injury-ridden season, he was still named the Braves second-best pro prospect after the season.\n\nHe spent most of 2003 and 2004 with Richmond, but appeared in 22 games with the Braves in 2004, recording his first Major League hit on May 8 against the Houston Astros.\n\nBetemit finally broke out in 2005 as the Braves' principal reserve infielder, frequently filling in at third base for the Braves' oft-injured star third baseman Chipper Jones, hitting .305 for the season. He hit his first career home run on April 27 against New York Mets pitcher Tom Glavine.\n\nIn the offseason, following shortstop Rafael Furcal's free agency in the winter of 2005, the Braves considered giving Betemit the starting shortstop job. However, they decided instead to trade for shortstop Edgar Rentería from the Boston Red Sox. Betemit continued to play a valuable role for the Braves as a pinch hitter and backup for second baseman Marcus Giles, Rentería, and Chipper Jones.\n\nOn July 28, 2006, Betemit was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for relief pitcher Danys Baez and infielder Willy Aybar. He made his debut for the Dodgers on July 30, 2006, playing third base against the Washington Nationals. He finished the season with a batting average of .241 with nine home runs and 24 RBIs.\n\nHe was expected to be the Dodgers starting third baseman in 2007, but poor play resulted in his becoming a part-time starter and pinch hitter. He hit pinch hit home runs in consecutive games against the Braves in May 2007. He hit 10 home runs and 26 RBIs in 84 games.\n\nOn July 31, 2007, the Dodgers traded Betemit to the New York Yankees for relief pitcher Scott Proctor. On August 2, 2007, Betemit homered in his first Yankee at bat while filling in at shortstop for Derek Jeter and was given a curtain call by the fans in attendance. On May 9, 2008, Betemit was the victim of Detroit Tigers pitcher Kenny Rogers' record setting 92nd career pickoff.\n\nOn November 13, 2008, Betemit, and minor league pitchers Jeffrey Marquez and Jhonny Núñez were traded to the Chicago White Sox for first baseman Nick Swisher and minor league pitcher Kanekoa Texeira.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, the White Sox designated Betemit for assignment to call up prospect Gordon Beckham.\n\nOn November 12, 2009, Betemit signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals. He began the 2010 season with Kansas City's Class AAA affiliate, the Omaha Royals of the Pacific Coast League.\n\nHe hit home runs from both sides of the plate on June 10, 2010, in a 9–8 win against Minnesota Twins.\n\nOn July 20, 2011, Betemit was traded to the Detroit Tigers for left-handed pitcher Antonio Cruz and catcher Julio Rodriguez.\n\nOn January 23, 2012, he signed a two-year, major league deal with an option for a third year with the Baltimore Orioles. In his first season with the team, he played in 102 games while hitting .261 with 12 home runs.\n\nOn March 25, 2013, Wilson was carried out on a stretcher during a spring-training game against the Boston Red Sox with an apparent ligament injury to his right knee. He started a rehab assignment on August 6, serving time with the Gulf Coast League Orioles, Bowie Baysox, Frederick Keys, and Norfolk Tides. The Orioles activated him from the 60-day disabled list on August 27. He was designated for assignment on September 16, 2013. He was released on September 24.\n\nBetemit signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays on February 6, 2014. Betemit failed to make the Rays Opening Day roster but accepted his outright assignment to AAA.\n\nIn July 2014 he joined the Rays' Triple-A affiliate Durham Bulls. On August 10, 2014, his team lost to the Buffalo Bisons. He became a free agent after the 2014 season.\n\nOn February 2, Betemit was suspended 50 games for using Performance-Enhancing Drugs (PEDs).\n\nOn April 12, 2016, Betemit signed with the Olmecas de Tabasco of the Mexican Baseball League. He was released on May 10, 2016.\n\nBetemit was named as the Hitting Coach for the DSL Royals for the 2019 season.\n\nThe pronunciation of Betemit's last name has been debated by baseball broadcasters and fans. Betemit has stated that he pronounces his name the way it is pronounced in his native Dominican Republic, i.e. \"Bay-tah-mee\", not \"Bet-eh-mitt\" (\"the 't' is silent,\" he explains). However, Betemit has also said that he does not especially care that many American baseball broadcasters have \"Americanized\" his name by pronouncing the \"t\".\n\nIn an interview in 2006, Atlanta Braves announcer Joe Simpson related that he had asked Betemit about halfway through that season how to pronounce his name, and when told the answer, apologized to him, saying, \"I've been pronouncing your name wrong all this time, but I'm gonna pronounce it right from now on!\"\n\nThere was some confusion surrounding Betemit's date of birth. His official Player Profile on MLB.com used to list it as July 28, 1980, while other sources, including Baseball-Reference.com, have it as November 2, 1981. An article from February 2000 in the Savannah Morning News offers an explanation for the discrepancy, saying that his real birthday is 1981-11-02.\n"}

It appears on the Ramones' 1981 album \"Pleasant Dreams\".\n\nThe protagonist sings that his girlfriend has been kidnapped by the Ku Klux Klan on her way to Los Angeles for the holidays and pleads with the listener to call federal authorities to find out where she is and whether she is still alive. \n\nIn , a documentary film about the Ramones, Ramones tour manager Monte Melenick stated that it seemed clear to him that Joey must have been obliquely referring to Johnny Ramone (who used to tease Joey for being Jewish) \"stealing\" away his girlfriend, Linda.\n\nJoey's brother Mickey Leigh has disagreed, saying that the song had been written before Joey learned of their affair. Leigh explains that the song was in response to Joey's relationship with a black woman, whose parents disapproved of the interracial relationship. Leigh asked Joey what happened to the girl and Joey responded by saying \"the KKK took my baby away.\"\n\nFormer Drummer Marky Ramone claimed in an interview for website Loudwire that the song was inspired by Joey's experience at a mental institution. Reportedly, the lead singer befriended an African-American woman who was also in the same institution. A few days later the woman left the institution making Joey depressed. As a result, the lead singer - according to Marky Ramone - wrote the song about this episode.\n\nLike almost all Ramones songs, the time signature is 4/4. It alternates two verses with a chorus; the second chorus is followed by a bridge, after which the first verse and the chorus are repeated with a change of key.\n\nIn the documentary \"\", Johnny Ramone states that the guitar riff of \"The KKK Took My Baby Away\" was inspired by the riff of Cheap Trick's \"He's a Whore\"\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Arizona Diamondbacks, Toronto Blue Jays, Tampa Bay Rays, New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles and New York Mets. While primarily a second baseman and left fielder, Johnson has appeared at every position except for pitcher, catcher, and center field during his career. Johnson was the first player to appear in a game for all five American League East teams; Steve Pearce became the second in 2018. He was on the New York Mets' postseason roster in 2015, where he appeared in his first World Series.\n\nJohnson was drafted in the first round (38th overall) of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft by the Atlanta Braves. Johnson decided to forego a scholarship offer to play college baseball at Texas A&M in favor of signing with the Braves. Johnson made his Major League debut with the Braves on May 29, 2005 and became a regular outfielder, due to the many injuries that plagued the Braves early in the 2005 season. Johnson was named the National League Player of the Week for the week of June 13 after batting .417 with three home runs and 11 RBIs in 24 at-bats.\nAn elbow injury sidelined Johnson for the entire 2006 season. He was placed on the disabled list during spring training after experiencing pain while making throws from the outfield, and had Tommy John surgery performed by Dr. James Andrews on June 1. During the offseason, Johnson spent many hours with Braves first base coach Glenn Hubbard at Turner Field to learn how to play second base effectively. Johnson earned the starting position at second base and as the leadoff hitter for the Braves for the 2007 season. On April 8, 2007, Johnson hit the first leadoff homer of his career in a 3-2 win against the New York Mets. In late June, Johnson lost his position as the leadoff hitter in the Braves lineup. In the 48 games Johnson played in May and June, his on-base percentage was .325, well below the acceptable rate for a good leadoff hitter. Willie Harris, who took over the role as primary leadoff hitter, had an on-base percentage of .440 prior to June 22 (Johnson's last game as the leadoff hitter), prompting Braves manager Bobby Cox to make the change. (As of August 10, Johnson had an on-base percentage of .419 since June 22.) In addition to being demoted from the top of the order, Johnson's offensive struggles motivated Cox to move Johnson into a platoon at second base with Yunel Escobar. He capped off his year with 16 homers and a .276 batting average.\n\nWith Escobar taking over full-time at shortstop, Johnson began the year as the Braves second baseman for the 2008 season. Johnson had the longest hitting streak in the National League of the 2008 season, hitting in 22-straight games. He hit .398 with 19 RBIs in 25 games in September. Johnson ended the 2008 season with a .287 batting average, 12 homers, 69 RBIs, 86 runs, and 11 stolen bases.\n\nIn 2009, Johnson lost his full-time starting position with the Braves. He increased his contact rate on pitches inside the strike zone, as well as swinging at more pitches outside the strike zone. This pattern is associated with a less-aggressive swing and was associated with his poor results in 2009.\n\nOn December 12, 2009, Johnson, was non-tendered by the Atlanta Braves making him a free agent.\n\nOn December 30, 2009, Johnson signed a one-year, $2.35 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Arizona had previously shown interest in acquiring Johnson from the Braves. Johnson said this about his new team,\nHe received the Player of the Month award for the month of April, his first month as a player for the Diamondbacks. He earned the award by hitting nine home runs and a .750 slugging percentage. In his first 22 games, Johnson batted .313 (25-80) with 18 RBI, 17 runs scored and a .404 OBP.\n\nOn July 23, 2010, Johnson successfully hit for the cycle against the San Francisco Giants. Johnson hit a solo home run in the first, a ground-rule double in the fifth, a two-run triple in the sixth and completed it with a single in the eighth. Johnson tied the game at 1 with his home run, almost tied the game with a double but it was a ground-rule so Young was held at third base, tied the game at 3 with a 2-run triple, and represented the tying run with his single.\n\nOn May 21, 2011, Johnson launched a pitch from Minnesota Twins closer Matt Capps deep into the right-field bleachers at Chase Field for a grand slam that capped the Diamondbacks rally from down 6-3 and made the score 9-6, which would be the final score.\n\nOn July 8, 2011, Johnson hit his second grand slam in the season off St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Kyle Lohse. Johnson gave the D-backs the lead in the seventh to break a tie 7-3. He hit a 2-2 pitch into the Cardinals bullpen while thinking that he only hit a sacrifice fly. The ball carried long enough to be a grand slam.\n\nOn August 23, 2011, Johnson was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for second baseman Aaron Hill and shortstop John McDonald. Johnson was set to debut for the Blue Jays on August 24, but had to return to Arizona because he forgot his passport. He made his debut instead on August 25, and went 1 for 2 with 2 walks and a run scored.\n\nJohnson hit his 100th career home run on May 16, 2012.\n\nIn January 2013, the Rays agreed to a one-year contract worth $2.45 million with Johnson. The contract became official on February 5, 2013. Johnson was the Rays Opening Day designated hitter, and throughout the year, he played there, left field, second base, third base, and 3 games at first base. Johnson got 50 starts in left field (the most on the team), splitting time with Matt Joyce and Sean Rodriguez. When he didn't start in left field, he would either come in off the bench, or get a start as a backup at one of the other positions. In 91 at-bats in May, he hit .330 with 7 HR and 26 RBI, and he hit .333 with 4 HR and 9 RBI in July, his only two above-average months. In 118 games in 2013, he hit .235 with 16 HR and 52 RBI. He experienced a severe drop in walks (27 less than 2012) and strikeouts (60 less than 2012), but he also played in 24 fewer games.\n\nIn December 2013, Johnson signed a one-year contract with the New York Yankees worth $3 million. In late July, Johnson suffered a groin injury that placed him on the 15-day DL. Johnson was mostly used as a reserve corner infielder with the Yankees, making 56 starts at the two positions. In 77 games with New York, he hit .219/.304/.373 with 6 HR and 22 RBI.\n\nThe Yankees traded Johnson to the Boston Red Sox for Stephen Drew on July 31, 2014 which was the first trade between the rival teams since 1997. This trade also reunited Johnson with Blue Jays manager John Farrell. Johnson played in just 10 games with the Red Sox, hitting 4-25 (.160) with a double and 1 RBI.\n\nThe Red Sox traded Johnson to the Baltimore Orioles, along with Michael Almanzar, for Ivan De Jesus Jr. and Jemile Weeks on August 30, 2014. He is the first player to play for every AL East team since MLB switched to six divisions in 1994.\n\nOn January 21, 2015, Johnson signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves. The deal included an invitation to spring training. On April 4, the team announced that Johnson had made the Opening Day\nroster. Through his first 28 games with the Braves, Johnson spent most of his playing time at third base and left field. On May 14, 2015, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, an oblique injury forced Johnson to leave the game after just two pitches in his first and only at bat. He had led the team in home runs at the time with six. He was placed on the DL and remained there until June 10, 2015. After everyday first baseman Freddie Freeman suffered a wrist injury, Johnson often split time at first base with Chris Johnson and Joey Terdoslavich, in addition to playing left field and occasionally at third base.\n\nOn July 24, 2015, the Braves traded Johnson and third baseman Juan Uribe, along with cash considerations, to the New York Mets for minor-league pitchers John Gant and Rob Whalen. In his first game as a Met, he hit a single, a double, and a home run in a 15–2 victory against the Los Angeles Dodgers. With the Mets, Johnson made his first major-league appearance at shortstop.\n\nOn January 8, 2016, Johnson again returned to the Braves, signing a one-year deal worth $2 million.\n\nOn June 8, 2016, the Braves traded Johnson to the Mets for minor league pitcher Akeel Morris.\n\nJohnson is married to Lauren, with whom he has four children.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Johnson was among the former MLB players who appeared with the Louisville Stars, a tournament team at the Bluegrass World Series.\n\n"}

Jeremy Dunham of IGN said, \"The lowest rung on the ladder of Dreamcast survival horror games, \"The Ring: Terror's Realm\" is just an average jaunt into the dark side,\" while a contributor to the PlanetDreamcast website (a part of GameSpy) declared it \"hands-down the worst thing I've ever experienced on the Dreamcast.\" Greg Wilcox of GameTour.com described it as \"one of those games that will make you wonder what sort of legal or illegal substances the developers were taking while they were making this one. The game is a combination of bad and weird, mostly leaning toward the bad\". Wilcox also noted that he \"managed to track down one of the videos from the series, and it's a hell of a lot scarier than what's here.\" GameSpot concluded that \"Die-hard survival-horror fans might possibly get a quick fix from this game, but even that's questionable. You'd really be better off playing through again.\n\nJim Preston reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it one star out of five, and stated that \"If it were a hamster, we would bury it in a shoebox in the backyard.\"\n"}

She was declared venerable in the Roman Catholic Church on 31 October 2013 by Pope Francis.\n\nNano Nagle lived in a period in Irish history when the English had imposed the Penal Laws. The Irish were denied access economically, politically, socially and educationally to the rights and means that would have raised them from poverty and oppression. The parliamentarian and orator, Edmund Burke, who was a relative of Nagle on his mother's side, and had spent his early years in Ballygriffin (where Nano was born), described those laws: \"Their declared object was to reduce the Catholics in Ireland to a miserable populace, without property, without estimation, without education.\"\nCatholics who dared to teach were subjected to heavy fines, confiscations, and periods of imprisonment. It was equally treasonable for Irish children to be sent overseas for their education.\n\nNano Nagle also known as \"Lady with the Lantern\", was born in Ballygriffin, just north of Killavullen, County Cork, in 1718, the daughter of Garret and Ann Mathews Nagle. The name \"Honora\" given at baptism was soon replaced in the family circle by the affectionate name \"Nano\". She was the eldest of six children, the others being Ann, Catherine, Elizabeth, David, and Joseph.\n\nShe was born in the Blackwater Valley in County Cork which possesses views of the distant Nagle Mountains. Much of this region was once the property of the Nagle family. They were connected to some of the most prominent families in Munster and their ancestors had lived in the area for hundreds of years. In the protracted struggle between the English and Irish for the possession of Ireland, the Nagles' loyalty to the Catholic king - James Francis Edward Stuart (James II of England and Ireland and James VIII of Scotland)- and the Catholic faith cost them extensive lands. However, when her parents married, the family still owned extensive property at Ballygriffin, Killavullen, as Garret's brother Joseph had converted to Protestantism so that he could hold property on behalf of the Roman Catholic members of his family as was required under the Penal Laws.\n\nNano Nagle is believed to have attended a hedge school close to her home before she was sent to France for the rest of her education. The first \"Act of 1695\" made it unlawful to open a Catholic school at home, and also forbade Catholics to travel overseas for education. The Nagles had a branch of the family who were merchants in Cork city, with strong connections on the European Continent, particularly in France. It was through these channels that Nano and her sister Ann were able to travel to Paris, smuggled, perhaps, in a cargo ship, where they received a full Catholic education and also enjoyed a sophisticated life in French society.\n\nAccording to one account she had a hectic social life in Paris – \"balls, parties and theatre outings, all the glamour of the life of a wealthy young lady\". It was after one of these parties that she noticed a group of wretched-looking people huddled in a church doorway and was taken aback by the contrast between her wealthy, privileged life and that of the Paris poor.\n\nAfter their father's death in 1746, she and her sister returned to Ireland and went to live with their mother in Dublin, where they found widespread poverty. She returned to Paris intending to enter an Ursuline convent, but a spiritual director advised her to return to Ireland and take up the education of deprived children there. She went back to Cork, where her brother Joseph lived, to set up her first school for the poor, in a rented mud cabin in Cove Lane, in defiance of the law, and in complete secrecy, even from her brother. He soon discovered her secret, as she described in a letter to a friend: \"This passed on very well until one day a poor man came to him, begging to speak to me to take his child into my school. On which he came to his wife and me, laughing at the conceit of a man who thought I was in the situation of a school mistress. Then I owned up that I had set up a school.\" Her brother was very angry with her at first, because of the risks involved, but later became reconciled and gave her his full support.\n\nNagle founded her first school in 1754 in Cove Lane with about 30 students. This is now the site of South Presentation convent. Within nine months, she was educating 200 girls. By 1757, she had opened seven schools, five for girls and two for boys. These provided pupils with a basic education and religious instruction. At first alone, and later with the support of her family, particularly her uncle Joseph Nagle, she established a network of schools in Cork. Not everybody in Cork welcomed the initiative: she was insulted in the street on occasion, and her pupils were dismissed as \"beggars' brats\".\n\nThe French Petites Écoles provided the model on which to base her schools\nbut she was to develop her own system of education. She described in a letter her ideas for education which described how she wanted the spiritual and temporal welfare of the pupils to be interwoven and to flow naturally together.\n\nNagle began to visit the sick and the elderly after school, bringing them food, medicine and comfort. She opened homes for aged women, and began conducting adult classes. She went from hovel to hovel each day to gather the most needy people to teach. Night-time ministries to poverty-ridden elderly and sick in her home town gave Nagle the nickname \"The Lady with the Lantern\". The lantern later became the symbol of the Sisters of the Presentation worldwide.\n\nAs her workload increased she realised that she would need help with her work. She set up an Ursuline convent in Cork city which she initially sponsored. In 1767, she stayed with the Ursuline Sisters on Rue des Ursulines in Paris while visiting her cousin Margaret Butler who had been professed just one year previously. Thus, in 1771, the first Ursuline convent was established in Ireland; the first community was made up of four Cork women – who were professed at the Ursuline Convent in the Rue St. Jacques in Paris – together with a reverend mother. However, they were unable to work for or educate the poor because at that time religious sisters were required to remain enclosed in their convents.\n\nNagle and her assistants continued their work without becoming an established religious congregation so they were free to work for the poor without being enclosed. On Christmas Eve 1775 she founded the Society of Charitable Instruction of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Cork. She resisted the local bishop when he expressed fears that the establishment of the convent might provoke a Protestant backlash. When her uncle Joseph died, he left her a large sum of money which she devoted to building schools and convents, providing relief for the poor and the infirm. All of this was done in secrecy, initially, but even the authorities, seeing the beneficent nature of her institutions, relaxed their vigilance somewhat.\n\nShe founded the first Presentation convent in Ireland on Cove Lane (now Douglas Street) in Cork, which opened on Christmas Day, 1775. There she received the habit on 29 June 1776, taking the name of \"Mother Mary of St. John of God.\" The sisters made their first annual vows on 24 June 1777.\n\nMaria Teresa Mulally was born in 1728 in Pill Lane in Dublin. By the time she was twenty Teresa had opened business as a milliner in her father's parlour. Winning a prize in a state lottery left her financially independent after the death of her parents. She started a Catholic school in Mary's Lane for the poor girls of inner-city Dublin in 1766, and sought an order of sisters to staff it.\n\nNagle died from tuberculosis on 26 April 1784. By the time she died she had established links with Mulally's Dublin group. In 1794, a group of women who had helped with Mulally's projects in Dublin joined with Nagle's Cork group, and eventually this group became the congregation of the Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Today, Congregations of the Sisters of the Presentation exist all over the world. For example, in 1854, Irish Sisters travelled to San Francisco, California, in the United States and within two weeks opened the first of many schools.\n\nIn Australia, the Presentation Sisters founded St. Mary's College for Girls in the town of Lismore, New South Wales, in 1886. In 1985, it was amalgamated with St. Joseph's High School for Boys, (founded by the Marist Brothers) to form Trinity Catholic College Lismore.\n\nIn 2000, Nagle was voted Irish Woman of the Millennium in recognition of her importance as a pioneer of female education in Ireland. She was once voted Ireland's greatest ever woman in a public poll. She inspired Edmund Ignatius Rice, the founder of the Christian Brothers, to bring education to the poor people. The Presentation order has spread to 23 countries worldwide. Some of the schools founded by the Presentation Sisters are named after her. Nano's teachings are still followed today.\n\n\n"}

Langerhans was drafted in the third round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft by the Atlanta Braves, and made his debut with them in 2002. He also played in Major League Baseball for the Oakland Athletics, Washington Nationals, Seattle Mariners, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nLangerhans attended Round Rock High School in Round Rock, Texas. During the 1996 season, Langerhans batted .442 and was selected to the All-State team. His next season, 1997, Langerhans batted .427 and was again selected to the All-State team. That season, Langerhans also won 11 games as a pitcher. During his senior season in 1998, Langerhans batted .512, was named to the All-State team, was selected as a Nike All-American, was selected to play in the 1998 Texas High School All-Star Game, and was named Texas Player of the Year. Langerhans is one of five players who attended Round Rock High School and have played in the major leagues. The four other players are John Danks, Brian Gordon, Jordan Danks and Travis Schlichting. Ryan Langerhans's father, John Langerhans, was his coach while playing for the Round Rock baseball team. During his senior year, Langerhans signed a letter of intent with the University of Texas, however, after being drafted by the Atlanta Braves, Langerhans went straight to professional baseball.\n\nLangerhans made his professional debut in 1998 with the rookie-level GCL Braves of the Gulf Coast League. He batted .277 with 41 hits, 10 doubles, 4 triples, 2 home runs, and 19 RBIs. In 1999, Langerhans was promoted to the Class-A Macon Braves of the South Atlantic League. In 121 games, Langerhans batted .268 with 120 hits, 30 doubles, 1 triple, 9 home runs, 49 RBIs, and 19 stolen bases. In 2000, Langerhans was assigned to the Class-A Advanced Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Carolina League. He appeared in 116 games with the Pelicans and batted .212 with 14 doubles, 7 triples, 6 home runs, 37 RBIs, and 25 stolen bases. Langerhans's 7 triples was tied for third most in the league with Choo Freeman (7), was and behind Damione Merriman (9), and Chone Figgins (14). Langerhans continued playing with the Class-A Advanced Myrtle Beach Pelicans in 2001. He batted .287 with 30 doubles, 3 triples, 7 home runs, 48 RBIs, and 22 stolen bases. In 2002, Langerhans was promoted to the Double-A Greenville Braves of the Southern League. He batted .251 with 23 doubles, 2 triples, 9 home runs, and 62 RBIs in 109 games.\n\nLangerhans was called up to the Atlanta Braves from the Double-A Greenville Braves in April, 2002. He appeared in one game that season where he had one at-bat against the Houston Astros where he did not record a hit. He was sent back down to the minors to start the 2003 season where he batted a combined .261 with 33 doubles, 4 triples, 10 home runs, and 49 RBIs between the Double-A Greenville Braves and the Triple-A Richmond Braves. Langerhans was called up by the Braves in September. On September 5, in his second game of the season, Langerhans got his first major league hit coming against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nDespite making his major league debut in 2002, Langerhans did not become an everyday big-league player until 2005, getting playing time for the Braves in all three outfield positions. He is part of the group of 18 rookie players nicknamed the \"Baby Braves\" that Atlanta called up from its minor league system during the 2005 season.\n\nLangerhans started 2006 as the Braves regular left fielder but a severe drop-off in his production from 2005 combined with the hot hitting of Matt Diaz resulted in a drop in Langerhans's playing time. By the end of the 2006 season, he was a platoon left-fielder, with Matt Diaz as his right-handed partner. Scott Thorman often also took starts from Langerhans as the left-handed part of the left-field platoon.\n\nAfter a poor start to 2007 at the plate, he was traded on April 29 to the Oakland Athletics for a player to be named later. He played just two games for the A's, going a combined 0-for-4 with a walk and an error.\n\nOn May 2, 2007, he was traded to the Washington Nationals for Chris Snelling.\n\nOn June 28, he was traded to the Seattle Mariners for utility player Mike Morse.\n\nWith the Mariners, Langerhans had better results hitting curve balls and sliders than fastballs and changeups, causing some speculation that this skill set could be responsible for his tendency to play in a part-time role.\n\nHe was non-tendered at the deadline to offer arbitration on December 12, 2009. On December 18, however, the Mariners re-signed Langerhans to a minor league contract.\n\nOn April 7, Langerhans was designated for assignment to make room for Jesús Colomé.\n\nOn December 14, 2010, the Mariners again re-signed Langerhans to a minor league contract.\n\nOn May 9, 2011, Langerhans was again designated for assignment to make room for Mike Wilson.\n\nOn July 29, 2011, Langerhans was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for cash considerations.\n\nLangerhans signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on December 23, 2011. Ryan was recalled by the Angels on May 14, 2012, when Torii Hunter was placed on the restricted list. On May 20, Langerhans was removed from a game against the Padres when he injured his right shoulder after crashing into the left-field wall at San Diego's Petco Park. After coming off the 15-day disabled list, Langerhans was outrighted by the Angels. On October 6, 2012, Langerhans elected free agency.\n\nOn December 18, 2012, the Toronto Blue Jays announced that Langerhans had been signed to a minor league contract with an invitation to major league spring training. Langerhans played for the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons during the 2013 season until he was released on June 21.\n\nAfter leaving the Bisons, Langerhans played for the Sugar Land Skeeters of the independent Atlantic League.\n\nLangerhans was signed to a minor league contract and assigned to the Buffalo Bisons again on August 22, 2013. When the Bisons season ended, Langerhans asked for and received his release, and returned to the Sugar Land Skeeters for their playoff run.\n\nOn September 26, Langerhans again signed with the Blue Jays. This time a major league contract as the Blue Jays were short on position players. He became a free agent on October 8, 2013.\n\nHe hit a game-winning home run against J.P. Howell on August 7, 2009, with two outs in the bottom of the 11th inning. This was his first career game-winning homer.\n\nOn August 25, 2009, Langerhans hit another game-winning home run against the Oakland Athletics off Craig Breslow on a two-ball two-strike pitch with one out and one runner on with the score tied, 2–2, in the bottom of the tenth.\n\nLangerhans and his wife, Shari, live in Round Rock, Texas, where he also graduated from high school. In high school Langerhans improved his baseball skills and participated in cross country. Langerhans won a Class 5A state championship with the Round Rock High School Dragons in 1997.\n\nThe Dragons were coached by his father John, a former standout baseball player for the University of Texas, where Ryan was signed to play before signing a professional contract. Ryan hit a tournament-record three triples in the state tournament semi-final against Corpus Christi Moody before earning the win as the pitcher in the championship game against traditional Texas powerhouse Lubbock Monterey, who was coached by Bobby Moegle, the winningest coach in United States high school baseball history.\n"}

The performers' songs are supported by an onstage musician or band that improvises the music, generally in the style of typical show tunes.\n\nThe format was created in New York City at Freestyle Repertory Theatre and has been performed by a number of different companies around the US. Currently, it is performed by BATS theatre in San Francisco, The Mop & Bucket Co. in Schenectady NY, and at several colleges around the country, including Stanford. \n\nThe Spontaneous Broadway format was created by Kat Koppett in association with Freestyle Repertory Theatre in New York.

This charitable zeal, and the fact that he established himself as the leading novelist of London life and character, led to him being characterised as the natural successor of Dickens.\n\nAll his friends considered Pett Ridge to be one of life's natural bachelors. They were rather surprised therefore in 1909 when he married Olga Hentschel.\nFour of his books, including \"Mord Em'ly\", were adapted as films in the early 1920s, all with scripts by Eliot Stannard.\nPett Ridge's great popularity as a novelist in the early part of the century declined in the latter years of his life. His work was considered to be rather old fashioned, though he still wrote and had published at least one book in each year in the final decade of his life. His last work, \"Led by Westmacott\", was published in the year after his death.\n\nWilliam Pett Ridge died, aged 71, at his home, Ampthill, Willow Grove, Chislehurst, on 29 September 1930 and was cremated at West Norwood on 2 October 1930. His ashes were taken away by his surviving family, his wife, a son and a daughter.\n\nHis books and stories include:\n\n \nWilliam Pett Ridge also wrote a play titled \"Four small plays\"; one of the originals is in ownership of direct descendants.\n\n"}

It has collections of more than 3,000 items that include 19th and 20th century's world-class European and American paintings, prints, drawings and sculptures. TMoCA also has one of the greatest collections of Iranian modern and contemporary art.\n\nThe museum was inaugurated by Empress Farah Pahlavi in 1977, just two years before the 1979 Revolution. TMoCA is considered to have the most valuable collections of modern Western masterpieces outside Europe and North America.\n\nAccording to Farah Pahlavi, the former Empress of Iran, the idea for this museum happened when she was in conversation with artist Iran Darroudi during a gallery opening in the 1970s and Darroudi mentioned she wished there was a place to show work more permanently. The Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art museum was supposed to be a place to show contemporary and modern Iranian artist alongside other international artists doing similar work.\n\nThe museum was designed by Iranian architect and cousin of the queen, Kamran Diba, who employed elements from traditional Persian architecture. It was built adjacent to Laleh Park, Tehran, and was inaugurated in 1977. The building itself can be regarded as an example of contemporary art, in a style of an underground New York Guggenheim Museum. Most of the museum area is located underground with a circular walkway that spirals downwards with galleries branching outwards. Western sculptures by artists such as Ernst, Giacometti, Magritte and Moore can be found in the museum's gardens.\n\nThe selection of the art was done under Farah Pahlavi and the budget was from the National Iranian Oil Company. Pahlavi personally met many of the artists whose work was part of the museum collection, including the Western artists Marc Chagall, Salvador Dalí, Henry Moore, Paul Jenkins, Arnaldo Pomodoro. Some people involved in the process of selecting art were the Americans, Donna Stein and David Galloway, and Kamran Diba, the architect and director of the museum, and Karimpasha Bahadori, who was the chief of staff of the cabinet.\n\nAfter the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Western art was stored away in the museums vault until 1999 when the first post-revolution exhibition was held of western art showing artists such as David Hockney, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol. Now pieces of the Western art collection are shown for a few weeks every year but due to the current conservative nature of the Iranian establishment, most pieces will never be shown.\n\nIt is considered to have the most valuable collection of Western modern art outside Europe and the United States, a collection largely assembled by founding curators David Galloway and Donna Stein under the patronage of Farah Pahlavi. It is said that there is approximately £2.5 billion worth of modern art held at the museum. The museum hosts a revolving program of exhibitions and occasionally organizes exhibitions by local artists.\n\nIn 1977, the Empress of Iran, Farah Pahlavi, purchased expensive Western artwork, in order to open this contemporary art museum. This museum was a controversial act, because the country's social and economic inequalities were rising and the government at the time was acting as a dictatorship and not tolerating the rising opponents, a few years later the Iranian Revolution took place. A few art pieces did not survive the revolution including a public statue by Bahman Mohasses deemed un-Islamic and a 1977 Warhol painting, a portrait of Farah Pahlavi.\n\n\"Le Monde\" art critic André Fermigier wrote an article in 1977 called \"A museum for whom and for what?\", \"questioning the link between an Iranian child and a Picasso or a Pollock\". And Farah Pahlavi responded to this criticism, noting that Iranians can understand modern art, not all Iranians were living in remote villages, and this issue with modern art was not unlike one that had existed in France.\n\nA touring exhibitions was planned for autumn 2016 in Berlin, (Germany), consisting of a three-month tour of sixty artworks, half Western and half Iranian. The show was to run for three months in Berlin, then travel to the Maxxi Museum of 21st Century Arts in Rome for display from March through August. However, the plan has been indefinitely postponed because the Iranian authorities have failed to allow the paintings to leave the country, also noting after the revolution these painting have not yet been shown in Iran.\n\nThis is a list of artists featured in the permanent collection at Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2114924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2114924", "title": "Spring Drive", "text": "Spring Drive\n\nThe Spring Drive is a watch movement conceived in 1977 by Yoshikazu Akahane (赤羽 好和) at Suwa Seikosha (now a part of Seiko Epson after a 1985 merger). Specified to one second accuracy per day, the movement uses a conventional power train as in traditional mechanical watches, but rather than an escapement and balance wheel, instead features Seiko's \"Tri-synchro Regulator\" system in which power delivery to the watch hands is regulated based on a reference quartz signal.\n\nCommercially released in 1999, the movement is found in watches distributed by the Seiko Watch Corporation, including its Credor, Grand Seiko, and Prospex brands. \n\nThe Spring Drive uses a conventional mainspring and barrel along with automatic and/or stem winding to store energy, just as in a traditional mechanical watch. However, the conventional escapement and balance wheel in traditional mechanical watches is replaced by Seiko's \"Tri-synchro Regulator\" system, a phase-locked loop wherein a rotor, which Seiko refers to as a \"glide wheel\", is powered by the mainspring barrel via a stator. The glide wheel in turn powers a reference quartz crystal and accompanying integrated circuit which controls an electromagnetic brake which then regulates the rotational speed of the glide wheel itself.\n\nThe glide wheel is intended to rotate eight times per second; the rotational speed is sampled once every rotation and a variable braking force is continuously applied to maintain that target frequency. As the glide wheel directly powers the seconds hand of the watch, this results in a true continuously sweeping second hand - in contrast to the beats per time motion resulting from the back-and-forth movement of traditional mechanical watches or the tick of typical quartz watches.\n\nThe movement is specified to ±15 seconds per month.\n\nThe design was first conceived by Yoshikazu Akahane at Suwa Seikosha in 1977 and patents were applied for it in 1982; in total, no fewer than 230 patents have been applied worldwide for this movement. Initial development was hindered by the high energy consumption of the reference quartz crystal and integrated circuit making a watch with a then-target 48-hour power reserve impossible; another attempt in 1993 was also unsuccessful for the same reason. It was not until a third attempt in 1997, using a quartz crystal and integrated circuit with energy consumption approximately one one-hundredth that used in the initial attempt in 1982 that a Spring Drive watch with sufficient power reserve was deemed feasible. Over 600 prototypes were produced during development.\n\nThe Spring Drive movement was announced publicly in 1997 and presented at the 1998 Basel Watch Fair. In 1999, the first production models were made available in Japan as limited edition, manual-wind watches in both the Credor and Seiko brands. The first non-limited model was released in Japan in 2002.\n\nThe first automatic-wind Spring Drive model was released in 2005 and coincided with the introduction of the Spring Drive movement to markets outside of Japan.\n\nEarly models, manual wind and 48h power reserve:\n\n\nCurrent calibers with standard features. Time accuracy: monthly rate within ±15 sec (equivalent to a daily rate of ±1 sec) and power reserve (72h) indicator.\n\n"}

The former community of Orenco now forms the Orenco neighborhood in Hillsboro, which is the site of the Orenco Station housing development.\n\nThe community was established in 1905 as a company town by the Oregon Nursery Company, within a 1200-acre (4.9 km) area owned by the company. The name Orenco is a composite of the company's initials. The Oregon Electric Railway established Orenco Station in 1908, and Orenco post office operated from 1909 to 1963. Of the original town, the church, a gas station, general store, and many original dwellings are still standing today. The Oregon Nursery Company shut down during the depression. Orenco later became part of Hillsboro. The company was responsible for introducing the Orenco Apple, a dessert apple, in the early 20th century.\n\nOrenco is located in the Tualatin Valley, with Rock Creek and other smaller streams running through the area. Major roads in the area include U.S. Route 26, Cornelius Pass Road, Cornell Road, NW 231st Avenue, and Baseline Road.\n\nOrenco's approximate location is northeast Hillsboro, north of Baseline Road, south of Cornell Road, west of Cornelius Pass Road, and east of Shute Road. Unlike the town of Orenco, the present-day neighborhood of the same name extends north of Cornell Road, with the Orenco Station area.\n\nEuropean American pioneers first arrived in the Orenco area in the mid-1850s, after the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850 encouraged settlers to travel to Oregon. The Orenco area was cleared by Chinese laborers employed by a number of local farmers.\n\nAt the turn of the century Archibald McGill and Malcolm McDonald formed the Oregon Nursery Company. In May 1906, the Oregon Nursery Company purchased in Washington County, Oregon where they would begin building a large nursery operation. In 1908, the town of Orenco was founded with the suggestion of the name coming from Anna Lisky McNew. The townsite was largely on the Donation Land Claim of William H. Bennett. Also in 1908, the Oregon Electric Railway began interurban service on its line between Forest Grove and Portland. The Orenco school district was formed on December 21, split from the Shute school district. Many of the first families in the town were Hungarians the company recruited and relocated from the Eastern European country. In 1909, the Orenco Presbyterian Church was founded in June. By 1910 the town had grown to over 500 residents and on December 6 the community organized a volunteer fire department.\n\nH. V. Meade began printing the town's paper, the \"Orenco Herald\" in 1914. The next year Orenco built its city hall that contained both the fire department and a jail. Enrollment at the school district reached 169 students by 1913. On January 6, 1913, the residents voted to incorporate the community. At this time the city consisted of a dry goods store, a hotel, two grocery stores, a blacksmith shop, a hardware store, a lumber yard, ice cream parlor, and a printing shop. Services in the town were water, sewer, telephones, electricity, street lighting, and a third-class post office.\n\nIn 1924, the city was the setting for a movie about the North-West Mounted Police by a Beaverton film studio. The Oregon Electric Railway (OE) closed its freight depot at Orenco in August 1928. Then in 1929, the Great Depression helped lead to the dissolution of the Oregon Nursery Company. With this development, many other businesses shut down and many residents moved away. In 1932, OE discontinued its interurban (passenger) service to Orenco, when the railroad company closed its Forest Grove line, with only freight trains continuing to use the rail line thereafter (until the line's abandonment in 1977). In 1938, residents voted to dissolve the municipal corporation.\n\nOregon Nursery Company founder Malcolm McDonald's home, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is still located on the north end of the property that was formerly The Orenco Woods Golf Course. The golf course opened in 1953 and was owned and operated by the Hillsboro Elks Lodge until it was sold to developers and closed in 2006. Due to the Great Recession, the land was not developed, and in 2013 it became the Orenco Woods Nature Park.\n\n\n"}

Pieces of silk fabric would be wadded up to form a ball, and then the wad would be wrapped with strips of fabric. As time passed, traditional temari became an art, with the functional stitching becoming more decorative and detailed, until the balls displayed intricate embroidery. With the introduction of rubber to Japan, the balls went from toys to art objects, although mothers still make them for their children. Temari became an art and craft of the Japanese upper class and aristocracy, and noble women competed in creating increasingly beautiful and intricate objects, some even altered so-as to double as handbags (like a \"kinchaku\" or a \"kimono bag\").\n\nTemari are highly valued and cherished gifts, symbolizing deep friendship and loyalty. Also, the brilliant colors and threads used are symbolic of wishing the recipient a brilliant and happy life. Traditionally, becoming a craftsman in Japan was a tedious process. Becoming a temari artist in Japan today requires specific training, and one must be tested on one's skills and technique before being acknowledged as a crafter of temari.\n\nTraditionally, temari were often given to children from their parents on New Year's Day. Inside the tightly wrapped layers of each ball, the mother would have placed a small piece of paper with a goodwill wish for her child. The child would never be told what wish their mother had made while making the ball.\n\nAlternately, some balls contained \"noisemakers\" consisting of rice grains or bells to add to the play value. It is said that traditional temari were wrapped so tightly they would bounce.\n\n\"Temari\" are also known as \"gotenmari.\"\n\nAll temari are made according to some specific method of construction that involves dividing the \"mari\" into a number of sections through the use of temporarily placed pins and permanently placed threads. There are three \"standard divisions\" which are recognized: simple division (\"tanjun toubun\"), 8-combination division (\"hachitoubun no kumiawase\"), and 10-combination division (\"juutoubun no kumiawase\").\n"}

Video games and computer-generated movies and special effects benefit from this as it creates more realistic scenes than with the more simplistic lighting models used.\n\nGraphics processor company Nvidia summarizes the motivation for HDR in three points: bright things can be really bright, dark things can be really dark, and details can be seen in both.\n\nThe use of high-dynamic-range imaging (HDRI) in computer graphics was introduced by Greg Ward in 1985 with his open-source Radiance rendering and \"lighting simulation\" software which created the first file format to retain a high-dynamic-range image.

Not until recently has the technology to put HDRI into practical use been developed.\n\nIn 1990, Nakame, \"et al.\", presented a lighting model for driving simulators that highlighted the need for high-dynamic-range processing in realistic simulations.\n\nIn 1995, Greg Spencer presented \"Physically-based glare effects for digital images\" at SIGGRAPH, providing a quantitative model for flare and blooming in the human eye.\n\nIn 1997, Paul Debevec presented \"Recovering high dynamic range radiance maps from photographs\" at SIGGRAPH, and the following year presented \"Rendering synthetic objects into real scenes\". These two papers laid the framework for creating HDR \"light probes\" of a location, and then using this probe to light a rendered scene.\n\nHDRI and HDRL (high-dynamic-range image-based lighting) have, ever since, been used in many situations in 3D scenes in which inserting a 3D object into a real environment requires the lightprobe data to provide realistic lighting solutions.\n\nIn gaming applications, \"Riven: The Sequel to Myst\" in 1997 used an HDRI postprocessing shader directly based on Spencer's paper. After E3 2003, Valve released a demo movie of their Source engine rendering a cityscape in a high dynamic range. The term was not commonly used again until E3 2004, where it gained much more attention when Epic Games showcased Unreal Engine 3 and Valve announced \"\" in 2005, coupled with open-source engines such as OGRE 3D and open-source games like \"Nexuiz\".\n\nOne of the primary advantages of HDR rendering is that details in a scene with a large contrast ratio are preserved. Without HDR, areas that are too dark are clipped to black and areas that are too bright are clipped to white. These are represented by the hardware as a floating point value of 0.0 and 1.0 for pure black and pure white, respectively.\n\nAnother aspect of HDR rendering is the addition of perceptual cues which increase apparent brightness. HDR rendering also affects how light is preserved in optical phenomena such as reflections and refractions, as well as transparent materials such as glass. In LDR rendering, very bright light sources in a scene (such as the sun) are capped at 1.0. When this light is reflected the result must then be less than or equal to 1.0. However, in HDR rendering, very bright light sources can exceed the 1.0 brightness to simulate their actual values. This allows reflections off surfaces to maintain realistic brightness for bright light sources.\n\nThe human eye can perceive scenes with a very high dynamic contrast ratio, around 1,000,000:1. Adaptation is achieved in part through adjustments of the iris and slow chemical changes, which take some time (e.g. the delay in being able to see when switching from bright lighting to pitch darkness). At any given time, the eye's static range is smaller, around 10,000:1. However, this is still higher than the static range of most display technology.\n\nAlthough many manufacturers claim very high numbers, plasma displays, LCD displays, and CRT displays can deliver only a fraction of the contrast ratio found in the real world, and these are usually measured under ideal conditions. The simultaneous contrast of real content under normal viewing conditions is significantly lower.\n\nSome increase in dynamic range in LCD monitors can be achieved by automatically reducing the backlight for dark scenes. For example, LG calls this technology \"Digital Fine Contrast\"; Samsung describes it as \"dynamic contrast ratio\". Another technique is to have an array of brighter and darker LED backlights, for example with systems developed by BrightSide Technologies.\n\nOLED displays have better dynamic range capabilities than LCDs, similar to plasma but with lower power consumption. Rec. 709 defines the color space for HDTV, and Rec. 2020 defines a larger but still incomplete color space for ultra-high-definition television.\n\nLight blooming is the result of scattering in the human lens, which human brain interprets as a bright spot in a scene. For example, a bright light in the background will appear to bleed over onto objects in the foreground. This can be used to create an illusion to make the bright spot appear to be brighter than it really is.\n\nFlare is the diffraction of light in the human lens, resulting in \"rays\" of light emanating from small light sources, and can also result in some chromatic effects. It is most visible on point light sources because of their small visual angle.\n\nOtherwise, HDR rendering systems have to map the full dynamic range to what the eye would see in the rendered situation onto the capabilities of the device. This tone mapping is done relative to what the virtual scene camera sees, combined with several full screen effects, e.g. to simulate dust in the air which is lit by direct sunlight in a dark cavern, or the scattering in the eye.\n\nTone mapping and blooming shaders can be used together to help simulate these effects.\n\nTone mapping, in the context of graphics rendering, is a technique used to map colors from high dynamic range (in which lighting calculations are performed) to a lower dynamic range that matches the capabilities of the desired display device. Typically, the mapping is non-linear – it preserves enough range for dark colors and gradually limits the dynamic range for bright colors. This technique often produces visually appealing images with good overall detail and contrast. Various tone mapping operators exist, ranging from simple real-time methods used in computer games to more sophisticated techniques that attempt to imitate the perceptual response of the human visual system.\n\nCurrently HDRR has been prevalent in games, primarily for PCs, Microsoft's Xbox 360, and Sony's PlayStation 3. It has also been simulated on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox and Amiga systems. Sproing Interactive Media has announced that their new Athena game engine for the Wii will support HDRR, adding Wii to the list of systems that support it.\n\nIn desktop publishing and gaming, color values are often processed several times over. As this includes multiplication and division (which can accumulate rounding errors), it is useful to have the extended accuracy and range of 16 bit integer or 16 bit floating point formats. This is useful irrespective of the aforementioned limitations in some hardware.\n\nComplex shader effects began their days with the release of Shader Model 1.0 with DirectX 8. Shader Model 1.0 illuminated 3D worlds with what is called standard lighting. Standard lighting, however, had two problems:\n\n\nOn December 24, 2002, Microsoft released a new version of DirectX. DirectX 9.0 introduced Shader Model 2.0, which offered one of the necessary components to enable rendering of high-dynamic-range images: lighting precision was not limited to just 8-bits. Although 8-bits was the minimum in applications, programmers could choose up to a maximum of 24 bits for lighting precision. However, all calculations were still integer-based. One of the first graphics cards to support DirectX 9.0 natively was ATI's Radeon 9700, though the effect wasn't programmed into games for years afterwards. On August 23, 2003, Microsoft updated DirectX to DirectX 9.0b, which enabled the Pixel Shader 2.x (Extended) profile for ATI's Radeon X series and NVIDIA's GeForce FX series of graphics processing units.\n\nOn August 9, 2004, Microsoft updated DirectX once more to DirectX 9.0c. This also exposed the Shader Model 3.0 profile for high-level shader language (HLSL). Shader Model 3.0's lighting precision has a minimum of 32 bits as opposed to 2.0's 8-bit minimum. Also all lighting-precision calculations are now floating-point based. NVIDIA states that contrast ratios using Shader Model 3.0 can be as high as 65535:1 using 32-bit lighting precision. At first, HDRR was only possible on video cards capable of Shader-Model-3.0 effects, but software developers soon added compatibility for Shader Model 2.0. As a side note, when referred to as Shader Model 3.0 HDR, HDRR is really done by FP16 blending. FP16 blending is not part of Shader Model 3.0, but is supported mostly by cards also capable of Shader Model 3.0 (exceptions include the GeForce 6200 series). FP16 blending can be used as a faster way to render HDR in video games.\n\nShader Model 4.0 is a feature of DirectX 10, which has been released with Windows Vista. Shader Model 4.0 allows 128-bit HDR rendering, as opposed to 64-bit HDR in Shader Model 3.0 (although this is theoretically possible under Shader Model 3.0).\n\nShader Model 5.0 is a feature of DirectX 11. It allows 6:1 compression of HDR textures without noticeable loss, which is prevalent on previous versions of DirectX HDR texture compression techniques.\n\nIt is possible to develop HDRR through GLSL shader starting from OpenGL 1.4 onwards.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1740, he was captain in the Spanish Army and fought in the War of the Austrian Succession. As he had been severely wounded in combat in 1743 (he was left for dead on the battlefield), he temporarily left the military and traveled through Europe. He studied the Prussian Army and lived in Paris, where he met Diderot, Voltaire and D'Alembert and studied the \"Encyclopédie\" and Enlightenment movements. He briefly visited London in September 1754.\n\nDue to Prime Minister Ricardo Wall's sponsorship, Ferdinand VI appointed him in 1755 ambassador to Portugal and in 1757 director general of Artillery. In 1760, Charles III appointed him ambassador to Poland and on his return he was sent to Portugal to supersede Nicolás de Carvajal, Marquis of Sarria in the command of the Spanish army then invading Portugal. His forces managed to capture the key border town of Almeida but were then forced to retreat following the intervention of British troops led by John Burgoyne at the Battle of Valencia de Alcántara and the war was brought to an end shortly afterwards by the Treaty of Paris.\n\nIn 1763 he was appointed captain general of the Province of Valencia. When the Esquilache Riots happened he was appointed captain general of New Castile and president of the Council of Castile. As he enjoyed the personal confidence of the king, his power was similar to a prime minister's. He promoted many enlightened reforms and he supported the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767. His political and courtier enemies, especially Floridablanca, managed to achieve his dismissal. He was appointed ambassador to France in 1773, where he stayed till 1787.\n\nIn Paris, analyzing the situation created after the United States won its independence, he drafted a projected Commonwealth for the Spanish Empire: three independent kingdoms (Peru, \"Tierra Firme\" (New Granada and Venezuela) and Mexico) with three Spanish \"infantes\" in their thrones. The Spanish king would remain as the Spanish Emperor.\n\nIn 1792, he returned to Spain to replace José Moñino, 1st Count of Floridablanca as secretary of State (Prime minister). After the imprisonment of Louis XVI (August, 1792) and the proclamation of the Republic in France (September), Aranda's Enlightenment leanings seemed incompatible with the total war that several European monarchies were about to declare against revolutionary France. Aranda was therefore replaced by Manuel Godoy in November. After the defeat of Spanish Army in Roussillon, Godoy and Aranda publicly quarreled in the Council of State. That same night Aranda was arrested and confined to Jaén. A year later he was indulted and retired to his estates in Aragon.\n\nHe was buried in the monastery of San Juan de la Peña. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2114954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2114954", "title": "Symphony No. 3 (Górecki)", "text": "Symphony No. 3 (Górecki)\n\nThe Symphony No. 3, Op. 36, also known as the Symphony of Sorrowful Songs (), is a symphony in three movements composed by Henryk Górecki in Katowice, Poland, between October and December 1976. The work is indicative of the transition between Górecki's dissonant earlier manner and his more tonal later style and \"represented a stylistic breakthrough: austerely plaintive, emotionally direct and steeped in medieval modes.\" It was premièred on 4 April 1977, at the Royan International Festival, with Stefania Woytowicz as soprano and Ernest Bour as conductor.\n\nA solo soprano sings Polish texts in each of the three movements. The first is a 15th-century Polish lament of Mary, mother of Jesus, the second a message written on the wall of a Gestapo cell during World War II, and the third a Silesian folk song of a mother searching for her son killed by the Germans in the Silesian uprisings. The first and third movements are written from the perspective of a parent who has lost a child, and the second movement from that of a child separated from a parent. The dominant themes of the symphony are motherhood and separation through war.\n\nUntil 1992, Górecki was known only to connoisseurs, primarily as one of several composers from the Polish School responsible for the postwar Polish music renaissance. That year, Elektra-Nonesuch released a recording of the 15-year-old symphony performed by the London Sinfonietta, that topped the classical charts in Britain and the United States. To date, it has sold more than a million copies, vastly exceeding the expected lifetime sales of a typical symphonic recording by a 20th-century composer. This success, however, has not generated similar interest in Górecki's other works.\n\nDespite a political climate that was unfavorable to modern art (often denounced as \"formalist\" by the communist authorities), post-war Polish composers enjoyed an unprecedented degree of compositional freedom following the establishment of the Warsaw Autumn festival in 1956. Górecki had won recognition among avant-garde composers for the experimental, dissonant and serialist works of his early career; he became visible on the international scene through such modernist works as \"Scontri\", which was a success at the 1960 Warsaw Autumn, and his First Symphony, which was awarded a prize at the 1961 Paris Youth Bienniale. Throughout the 1960s, he continued to form acquaintanceships with other experimental and serialist composers such as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Górecki began to distance himself from the serialism and extreme dissonance of his earlier work, and his Third Symphony, like the preceding choral pieces \"Euntes ibant et flebant\" (Op. 32, 1972) and \"Amen\" (Op. 35, 1975), starkly rejects such techniques. The lack of harmonic variation in Górecki's Third Symphony, and its reliance on repetition, marked a stage in Górecki's progression towards the harmonic minimalism and the simplified textures of his more recent work. Because of the religious nature of many of his works during this period, critics and musicologists often align him with other modernist composers who began to explore radically simplified musical textures, tonality, and melody, and who also infused many of their works with religious significance. Like-minded composers, such as Arvo Pärt and John Tavener, are frequently grouped with Górecki under the term \"holy minimalism,\" although none of the composers classified as such has admitted to common influences.\n\nIn 1973, Górecki approached the Polish folklorist Adolf Dygacz in search of traditional melodies to incorporate in a new work. Dygacz presented four songs which had been recorded in the Silesia region in south-western Poland. Górecki was impressed by the melody \"Where has he gone, my dear young son?\" (\"Kajże się podzioł mój synocek miły?\"), which describes a mother's mourning for a son lost in war, and probably dates from the Silesian Uprisings of 1919–21. Górecki had heard a version of the song in the 1960s and had not been impressed by the arrangement, but the words and the melody of Dygacz's new version made a lasting impression on him. He said \"for me, it is a wonderfully poetic text. I do not know if a 'professional' poet would create such a powerful entity out of such terse, simple words. It is not sorrow, despair or resignation, or the wringing of hands: it is just the great grief and lamenting of a mother who has lost her son.\"\n\nLater that year, Górecki learned of an inscription scrawled on the wall of a cell in a German Gestapo prison in the town of Zakopane, which lies at the foot of the Tatra mountains in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna, a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944. It read \"O Mamo, nie płacz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie\" (Oh Mamma do not cry, no. Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you support me always). The composer recalled, \"I have to admit that I have always been irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in the face of death I would shout out in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words\". He later explained, \"In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does not think about herself; whether she deserves her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was something extraordinary. And it really fascinated me.\"\n\nGórecki now had two texts: one from a mother to her son, the other from a daughter to her mother. While looking for a third that would continue the theme, he decided on a mid-15th-century folk song from the southern city of Opole. Its text contains a passage in which the Virgin Mary speaks to her Son dying on the cross: \"O my son, beloved and chosen, Share your wounds with your mother ...\" (\"Synku miły i wybrany, rozdziel z matką swoje rany ...\"). Górecki said, \"this text was folk-like, anonymous. So now I had three acts, three persons ... Originally, I wanted to frame these texts with an introduction and a conclusion. I even chose two verses (5 and 6) from Psalm 93/94 in the translation by Wujek: 'They humiliated Your people, O Lord, and afflicted Your heritage, they killed the widow and the passer-by, murdered the orphans. However, he rejected this format because he believed the structure would position the work as a symphony \"about war\". Górecki sought to transcend such specifics, and instead structured the work as three independent laments.\n\nThe symphony is constructed around simple harmonies, set in a neo-modal style which makes use of the medieval musical modes, but does not adhere strictly to medieval rules of composition. A performance typically lasts about 54 minutes. Ronald Blum describes the piece as \"mournful, like Mahler, but without the bombast of percussion, horns and choir, just the sorrow of strings and the lone soprano\". The work consists of three elegiac movements, each marked \"Lento\" to indicate their slow tempi. Strings dominate the musical textures and the music is rarely loud—the dynamics reach \"fortissimo\" in only a few bars.\n\nThe symphony is scored for solo soprano, four flutes (two players doubling on piccolos), four clarinets in B, two bassoons, two contrabassoons, four horns in F, four trombones, harp, piano and strings. Górecki specifies exact complements for the string forces: 16 first violins, 16 second violins, 12 violas, 12 cellos, and 8 double basses. For most of the score, these are in turn divided into two parts, each notated on a separate staff. Thus the string writing is mainly in ten different parts, on ten separate staves. In some sections some of these parts are divided even further into separate parts, which are written on the same staff, so that ten staves are still used for a greater number of parts.\n\nUnusually, the score omits oboes, English horns, bass clarinets, and trumpets. The bassoons, contrabassoons, and trombones play only in the first movement, and only for a few bars (bassoons and contrabassoons: 339–342 and 362–369; trombones: 343–348 and 367–369).\n\nThe musicologist Adrian Thomas notes that the symphony lacks dissonance outside of modal inflections (that is, occasional use of pitches that fall outside the mode), and that it does not require nonstandard techniques or virtuosic playing. Thomas further observes that \"there is no second-hand stylistic referencing, although if predecessors were to be sought they might be found, distantly removed, in the music of composers as varied as Bach, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, and even Debussy.\"\n\nTypically 27 minutes in duration, the first movement equals the combined length of the second and third movements, and is based on a late 15th-century lament of Mary from the \"Lysagora Songs\" collection of the Holy Cross Monastery (\"Św. Krzyż Monastery\") in the Świętokrzyskie Mountains. Comprising three thematic sections, the movement opens with a canon based on a 24-bar theme, which is repeated several times. The canon begins in 2 parts; then, for each repetition of the theme, an extra part is added, until the canon is in eight parts (with the top two parts doubled at the octave, making for ten voices total), using a 24-bar melody in the Aeolian mode on E. It begins with the double basses, 2nd part, with each succeeding entry occurring one measure later (i.e., a new entry begins every 25 measures), each starting a diatonic fifth above the last. That means that each appearance of the melody in a new part is in a different mode, in this order:\n\n\nAfter the 8-part canon is played, it is repeated, with the 1st parts of the 1st and 2nd violins (silent up to this point) doubling the other violin parts an octave higher.\n\nAfter that, the canon continues, but the voices gradually drop out one by one, from the lowest upwards and the highest downwards; the instruments in question then double, or play the parts of, a higher or lower voice that is still playing, in this order ('→' means 'double/play the parts of'):\n\n\nThe canon ends, with all the strings (except the double basses) ending on a single note, E4.\n\nThe soprano enters on the same note in the second section and builds to a climax on the final word, at which point the strings enter forcefully with the climax of the opening canon. The third section of the movement (\"Lento—Cantabile semplice\") is a long \"dénouement\", another canon based on the same melody in the opening canon; but this time it starts with 8 parts (the top two doubled in octaves), and the voices drop out from high to low:\n\n\nThe movement thus ends with the lower strings, and the piano (briefly recalling the second section of the movement).\n\nThe nine-minute second movement is for soprano, clarinets, horns, harp, piano, and strings, and contains a libretto formed from the prayer to the Virgin Mary inscribed by Helena Błażusiakówna on the cell wall in Zakopane. According to the composer, \"I wanted the second movement to be of a highland character, not in the sense of pure folklore, but the climate of Podhale ... I wanted the girl's monologue as if hummed ... on the one hand almost unreal, on the other towering over the orchestra.\"\n\nThe movement opens with a folk drone, A–E, and a melodic fragment, E–G–F, which alternate with sudden plunges to a low B–D dyad. Thomas describes the effect as \"almost cinematic ... suggest[ing] the bright open air of the mountains\". As the soprano begins to sing, her words are supported by the orchestra until she reaches a climaxing top A. The movement is resolved when the strings hold a chord without diminuendo for nearly one and a half minutes. The final words of the movement are the first two lines of the Polish Ave Maria, sung twice on a repeated pitch by the soprano.\n\nThe tempo of the third movement is similar to that of the previous two, and subtle changes in dynamism and mode make it more complex and involving than it may at first appear. With a duration of approximately seventeen minutes, it comprises three verses in A minor and, like the first movement, is constructed from evolving variations on a simple motif. The melody is established in the opening verse, and the second and third verses revisit the cradling motifs of the second movement. As in the second movement, the motifs are built up from inversions of plain triads and seventh chords stretching across several octaves. As the soprano sings the final words, the key changes to a pure diatonic A major which accompanies, in writer David Ellis's words, the \"ecstatic final stanza\":\nThe orchestra returns to A minor before a final postlude in A major. In Górecki's own words: \"Finally there came that unvarying, persistent, obstinate 'walczyk' [on the chord of A], sounding well when played piano, so that all the notes were audible. For the soprano, I used a device characteristic of highland singing: suspending the melody on the third [C] and descending from the fifth to the third while the ensemble moves stepwise downward [in sixths]\".\n\nThe symphony was dedicated to Górecki's wife Jadwiga Rurańska. When asked why, Górecki responded, \"Who was I supposed to dedicate it to?\" He never sought to explain the symphony as a response to a political or historical event. Instead, he maintained that the work is an evocation of the ties between mother and child. Górecki was commissioned to write music in response to the Holocaust in the 1960s but was unable to finish any of the pieces he started for that purpose. While Górecki stated that for many years he sought to produce a work specifically in response to Auschwitz, he resisted that interpretation of the symphony, which he preferred to be viewed in a wider context. Other critics have attempted to interpret the symphony in spiritual terms, an approach which Górecki also dismissed. Still others have suggested that the symphony can be understood as a compendium of Polish history:\n\nGórecki said of the work, \"Many of my family died in concentration camps. I had a grandfather who was in Dachau, an aunt in Auschwitz. You know how it is between Poles and Germans. But Bach was a German too—and Schubert, and Strauss. Everyone has his place on this little earth. That's all behind me. So the Third Symphony is not about war; it's not a \"Dies Irae\"; it's a normal Symphony of Sorrowful Songs.\"\nGórecki's Symphony No. 3 was written in 1976, when Górecki was, in the words of the music critic Jane Perlez, \"a fiery figure, fashionable only among a small circle of modern-music aficionados\". The 1977 world première at the Royan Festival, Ernest Bour conducting, was reviewed by six western critics, all of them harshly dismissive. Heinz Koch, writing for \"Musica\", said that the symphony \"drags through three old folk melodies (and nothing else) for an endless 55 minutes\". Górecki himself recalled that, at the premiere, he sat next to a \"prominent French musician\" (Górecki did not name names, though it was probably Pierre Boulez), who, after hearing the twenty-one repetitions of an A-major chord at the end of the symphony, loudly exclaimed \"Merde!\"\n\nThe symphony was first recorded in Poland in 1978 by the soprano Stefania Woytowicz. It was deemed a masterpiece by Polish critics, although, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, recordings and performances of the work were widely criticised by the press outside Poland. The symphony drew hostility from critics who felt that Górecki had moved too far away from the established avant-garde style and was, according to Dietmar Polaczek (writing for \"Österreichische Musikzeitschrift\"), \"simply adding to the decadent trash that encircled the true pinnacles of avant-gardism\".\n\nIn 1985, the French filmmaker Maurice Pialat featured a section of the third movement in the ending credits of his movie \"Police\". When the work was later repackaged as a \"soundtrack album\", it sold well. Although Gorecki's name was featured prominently on the front cover, the sleeve notes on the back provided precious little information about the work, and Górecki's name appeared in smaller type than those of the main actors. In the mid-1980s, British industrial music group Test Dept used the symphony as a backdrop for video collages during their concerts, recasting the symphony as a vehicle for the band's sympathy with the Polish Solidarity movement, which Górecki also supported (his 1981 piece \"Miserere\" was composed in part as a response to government opposition of Solidarity trade unions). During the late 1980s, the symphony received increasing airplay on US and British classical radio stations, notably Classic FM. The fall of communism helped to spread the popularity of Polish music generally, and by 1990 the symphony was being performed in major cities such as New York, London and Sydney. A 1991 recording with the London Sinfonietta, conducted by David Zinman and featuring the soloist Dawn Upshaw, was released in 1992 by the Elektra imprint Nonesuch Records. Within two years, the recording had sold more than 700,000 copies worldwide; the recording climbed to number 6 on the mainstream UK album charts, and while it did not appear on the US \"Billboard\" 200, it stayed at the top of the US classical charts for 38 weeks and stayed on for 138 weeks. The Zinman/Upshaw recording has sold over a million copies. It probably counts as the best selling contemporary classical record of all time.\n\nMichael Steinberg described the symphony's success as essentially a phenomenon of the compact disc, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in \"A guide to the symphony\", wondered whether the commercial success of the work was \"a flash in the pan\" or would turn out to have lasting significance. In 1998, Steinberg asked, \"[are people] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?\" Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the \"Doctor Zhivago\" phenomenon of 1958: \"Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity.\" Górecki was as surprised as anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that \"perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. Somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed.\"\n\nAt least a dozen recordings were issued in the wake of the success of the Nonesuch recording, and the work enjoyed significant exposure in a number of artistic media worldwide. The work was repeatedly used by filmmakers in the 1990s and onwards to elicit a sense of pathos or sorrow, including as an accompaniment to a plane crash in Peter Weir's \"Fearless\" (1993), and in the soundtrack to Julian Schnabel's \"Basquiat\" (1996). An art gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico opened an exhibit in 1995 dedicated entirely to visual art inspired by the piece.

Nevertheless, with time its original name persisted, which may come from one of two sources: Either the Aymara language \"lima-limaq\" (meaning \"yellow flower\"), or the Spanish pronunciation of the Quechuan word \"rimaq\" (meaning \"talker\", and actually written and pronounced \"limaq\" in the nearby Quechua I languages). It is worth noting that the same Quechuan word is also the source of the name given to the river that feeds the city, the Rímac River (pronounced as in the politically dominant Quechua II languages, with an \"r\" instead of an \"l\"). Early maps of Peru show the two names displayed jointly.\n\nIn 1988, UNESCO declared the historic center of Lima a World Heritage Site for its originality and high concentration of historic monuments constructed in the time of Spanish presence.\n\nOf the structures in the historical center of Lima, situated are more than 1,600 balconies that were built in the viceroyalty era as well as in the republic. In order to retain its conservation, the Municipality of Lima has invited individuals and companies to adopt a balcony in order to maintain them as if they were new. The abundance of these balconies adds to the particular harmony and originality to this part of the city.\n\nAt the time of the Viceroyalty of Peru, a work of art was created, a magnificence, a grandeur and a legendary royal life.\n\nThe authority of the viceroy, like representative of the Spanish monarchy was particularly important, since its appointment supposed an important ascent and the successful culmination of a race in the colonial administration.\n\nThe entrances to Lima of the new viceroys were specially lavish. For the occasion, the streets were paved with silver bars from the doors of the city of Lima to the Palace of the Viceroy.\n\nThe Archbishop Palace is the home of the Archbishop of Lima. It is a popular tourist attraction in the Historical centre of Lima, Peru. The first major church began construction in 1535. Pope Paul III turned it into an episcopal seat in 1541. In 1547, Lima was elevated to an archdiocese, which turned it by a short period, in the more extensive ecclesiastical circumscription of the world.\nThe patron of the episcopal seat is Saint Rosa of Lima.\n\nThe Museum of Italian Art is the only European arts museum of Peru. It has a wide collection of paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints and ceramics that belong to Italian artists from the beginnings of the 20th century, as well as a collection of 35 contemporary Italian paintings.\n\nThis house was constructed in 1535 on a pre-Columbian sanctuary.\nIt was constructed on the date, that is shared with that of the foundation of the city, it has been inhabited permanently by the descendants of the first proprietor, Jerónimo de Aliaga, standard-bearer and exchequer for Francisco Pizarro.\nThis home is the oldest mansion of the city and faces the Government Palace, former seat of Pizarro's rule, in a lateral street.\nTheir halls, extensive and luxurious and their inner patio, have all the characteristics of the most important mansions of the historical center of Lima of the viceroyalty time.\nGiven the perfect state of conservation, in special circumstances, this mansion often hosts certain cultural events. The mansion, still a private home, can be visited by pre-arrangement with an entry fee of approximately $11 US.\n\nIn this house, one of oldest of the city, lived the Oidor, that was named by the Spanish monarchy to act in the colonial administration. The Oidor had by functions to cross the administered territory to control its government. In this sense, it advised to the viceroy as a consultant.\n\nThis is one of the oldest houses of Lima, constructed in 1590 by a Jesuit priest by the name of Ruiz Portillo. The name of this large house was given by the Spaniards who arrived and stated the similarity of the house with one in Seville.\n\nThis is one of the most outstanding houses of the historical center, constructed in the middle of the 18th century with French influence. One is in its original state with its balconies a typical characteristic of colonial Lima.\n\nThis house was constructed in the 18th century by the Riva Agüero family, whose last member, the intellectual José de la Riva-Agüero, donated it to the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. At the present time Agüero is used like headquarters of the Riva Institute, conserving an interesting historical file and a library being simultaneously used by the local Museum of Popular Art of the PUCP.\n\nConstruction was begun on the Cathedral of Lima in 1535—the same year the city was founded. The Cathedral of Lima displays architecture typical of the Spanish colonial era. The pews of the cathedral and the benches of the choir are of the finest quality. The Greater Altar is gold plated and has images of the colonial era. Within the cathedral are the ashes of Francisco Pizarro, the founder of Lima. Every year, in the month patriotism, is celebrated the mass Te Deum in gratefulness by the independence from Spain. A custom retaken by the Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani, is to give the mass all Sundays at 11:00 a.m. In 2005 the mayor of Lima created the project of illuminating the exterior of the cathedral with new lights.\n\nIt took more than five decades delay for the construction of the church and the Convent of Santo Domingo, because the project begun at the same time as the foundation of Lima and the end of the 16th century marked by the end of it. The church is composed by three naves with a carved choral ashlar masonry in cedar wood. The church is crowned by a large cuple. The interior displays images from the first years of the City and also an image of Our Lady the Virgin of the Rosary, which first arrived at the Rímac Valley, Patron of the city, has deep relation with the Peruvian saints and by its remarkable devotion that was crowned in the year 1927 in a unique event in the religious history of the country. On the other hand, the convent, like all, has interesting claustros and in this case, with Sevillian style patios their typical tiles. Its capitulary room is of the baroque style. It is here, in 1551, that the National University of San Marcos was founded, the first in the Americas. The temple of Our Lady of the Rosary (original name of the church of Santo Domingo) was elevated to the category of basilica in 1930, and in its interior is the Altar of the Peruvian Saints, which is visited annually by thousands of residents of Peru and by many foreigners.\n\nThis architectonic complex was constructed in the 17th century and is made up by the church and the convent of San Francisco, as well as of the chapels of the Solitude and the Miracle. During your visit their claustros can be appreciated, their patios adorned with Sevillian tiles and the library. Here it is the headquarters of the Museum of Religious Art and the Zurbarán Room. Under this complex there is a network of underground galleries and catacombs that were a cemetery at the colonial time and which are also very much visited.\n\nThe Church of Merced was constructed in the 18th century with a churrigueresco style; appreciating it as much external as internally, the visitor occurs an idea of the splendor of the architecture of the time. In this church, full of works of art there is an emphasis on the greater altar in honor to the Virgin of Mercedes and one sacristía with arabesque tiles. Here it is possible to see one of the decks of collections of paintings and colonial statures of the city. The Virgin of the Mercedes is the patron of the Arms of the nation.\n\nSanctuary where is venerated main Peruvian catholic devotion \" Lord of Miracles\", Señor de los Milagros, who is Patron of the city. It was constructed together with Monastery of Nazarenas nuns in the 18th century, after the 1746 Lima–Callao earthquake.\n\nMain church of Society of Jesus in Peru, it was constructed in 1638 as Church of San Pablo Apóstol. In 1767 it was called San Pedro.\n\nThe Government Palace is the residence of the President of the Republic. Its original name is the House of Pizarro but informally it is designated to him like the Palace of Government.\n\nThe Palace of Torre Tagle probably is the most significant mansion built at the beginning of the 18th century. Initially it belonged to Don Bernardine Jose of Tagle Portocarrero, fourth and last Marquess of Torre Tagle. The Peruvian state acquired it in 1918 and from 1919 it is the main headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Peru. It is made of artistic Limean architecture which describes its originality and also demonstrates the racially mixed contributions of the Viceroyalty of Peru, fitting them together harmoniously. It has a carved stone cover and two balconies, that are authentic jewels of the \"City of the Kings\". One is in perfect state of conservation.\n\nThis park was constructed in 1870. In 1921 the park was located in where the cultural Center of the National University of San Marcos now stands. In the occasion of the centenary of the independence of the nation, the German colony arranged to construct the 30 meter Tower of the Clock. At noon, their bells touch notes of the national anthem.\n\nThe Plaza Mayor is located where Francisco Pizarro founded Lima. Initially, there were small stores and commerce. Also, it was the scene of an excess of bulls and served like the site of execution of the condemned until death by the Court of Santa Inquisición. In 1651, a bronze battery was placed in the center of the seat that lasts to date. It was in the Plaza Mayor where it was proclaimed, in 1821, the Act of Independence of Peru. It is surrounded by the Palace by Government, the Municipality of Lima, the Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace.\n\nThis plaza was inaugurated in 1921 in the occasion of the centenary of the independence of Peru. In the central part, there is a monument in honor of General José de San Martín. It was built by the Catalan sculptor Mariano Benlliure. In this plaza of important buildings, the former Hotel Bolívar stands, which until the new millennium, was most elegant of Lima, as well as the Club Nacional, the watering hole for Lima's high society. The plaza has become one of the many symbols of Lima.\n\nPlaza dos de Mayo is a square built in 1874 by the Peruvian government to commemorate the Battle of Callao which occurred on 2 May 1866.\n\nThe Court of Santo Oficio was established in 1569 with the purpose of sanctioning heresies and other crimes against the Catholic faith. Its abolition dates from 1820. On the external part of this monument it is possible to see an imposing neoclassic porch and, in the main hall, an outstanding carved wood ceiling, which is considered best in the city.\n\n\n"}

Bagemihl devotes three chapters; \"Two Hundred Years at Looking at Homosexual Wildlife\", \"Explaining (Away) Animal Homosexuality\" and \"Not For Breeding Only\" in his 1999 book \"Biological Exuberance\" to the \"documentation of systematic prejudices\" where he notes \"the \"present ignorance\" of biology lies precisely in its single-minded attempt to find reproductive (or other) 'explanations' for homosexuality, transgender, and non-procreative and alternative heterosexualities.\" Petter Bøckman, academic adviser for the \"Against Nature?\" exhibit stated \"[M]any researchers have described homosexuality as something altogether different from sex. They must realize that animals can have sex with who they will, when they will and without consideration to a researcher's ethical principles.\" Homosexual behavior is found amongst social birds and mammals, particularly the sea mammals and the primates.\n\nSexual behavior takes many different forms, even within the same species and the motivations for and implications of their behaviors have yet to be fully understood. Bagemihl's research shows that homosexual behavior, not necessarily sex, has been documented in about five hundred species as of 1999, ranging from primates to gut worms. Homosexuality in animals is seen as controversial by social conservatives because it asserts the naturalness of homosexuality in humans, while others counter that it has no implications and is nonsensical to equate natural animal behaviors to morality. Sexual preference and motivation is always inferred from behavior. Thus homosexual behavior has been given a number of terms over the years. The correct usage of the term \"homosexual\" is that an animal \"exhibits homosexual behavior\", however this article conforms to the usage by modern research, applying the term \"homosexuality\" to all sexual behavior (copulation, genital stimulation, mating games and sexual display behavior) between animals of the same sex.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe all-female Whiptail lizard species \"Aspidoscelis neomexicanus\" (center), which reproduces via parthenogenesis, is shown flanked by two sexual species having males, \"A. inornatus\" (left) and \"A. tigris\" (right). Research has shown that simulated mating behavior increases fertility for \"Aspidoscelis neomexicanus\". One female lies on top of another, playing the role of the male, the lizard that was on bottom has larger eggs, in most cases. The lizards switch off this role each mating season.\n\n\nMale homosexuality has been inferred in several species of dragonflies. A survey of damsel and dragonflies reveals characteristic cloacal pincher mating damage in 20–80 percent of the males, indicating a fairly high occurrence of sexual coupling between males.\n\n"}

It was originally released on the \"Blew\" EP in December 1989. A second studio version appears on the compilation album \"Incesticide\", released in December 1992.\n\nThe song has been certified Gold by the IFPI Danmark.\n\nWritten in 1989, \"Been a Son\" was first recorded in the studio in September 1989 by Steve Fisk at Music Source in Seattle, Washington. Of the five songs recorded, only two were officially released, with both \"Been a Son\" and \"Stain\" appearing on the \"Blew\" EP in December 1989. The session was Nirvana's first time recording on two inch, 24 track tape, and Fisk recalls that \"when it was all over with, we played 'Been a Son' really loud on the big stupid speakers three times and stood up on the client tables in the back room and danced.\"\n\n\"Been a Son\" was first performed live on October 8, 1989 at the Lif Ticket Lounge in Omaha, Nebraska, the show at which Nirvana also debuted the future \"Nevermind\" song, \"Breed\", which was then called \"Immodium\". On September 25, 1990, Cobain performed a solo acoustic version of the song on the \"Boy Meets Girl\" show, hosted by Beat Happening vocalist and guitarist Calvin Johnson, on KAOS (FM) in Olympia, Washington.\n\nA second studio version of \"Been a Son\" was recorded for the BBC program \"The Evening Session\" by Miti Adhikari, at Maida Vale Studios in London, England on November 9, 1991. It was released on \"Incesticide\" in December 1992.\n\n\"Been a Son\" was rehearsed for Nirvana's \"MTV Unplugged\" appearance in November 1993, but cut from the set list prior to the show.\n\nThe Fisk-recorded version of \"Been a Son\" was re-released on the band's first greatest hits album, \"Nirvana\", in October 2002. Prior to this, this version had only been commercially-available on the \"Blew\" EP, which had only been released in the United Kingdom and in limited numbers. Kurt St. Thomas called this version the definitive take, because it better displayed Nirvana's signature thrashing guitar sound and featured a bass guitar solo prominent in the mix.\n\n\"Been a Son\" represents one of Cobain's earliest commentaries on the issues of sex and gender. In his 1993 biography \"\", Michael Azerrad described \"the instantly catchy\" song as being about \"the plight of a girl whose parents would have preferred a boy.\" Jenn Pelly of \"Pitchfork\" described it as \"a comment on how patriarchy sees women as second-class citizens, on how it dictates what it thinks women should be.\"\n\n\"Been a Son\" has been cited as one of the earliest examples of Nirvana's more melodic direction following the release of their 1989 debut album, \"Bleach\". As author Chuck Crisafulli noted, Cobain suppressed his pop influences during the band's earliest years, but after the release of \"Bleach\", he became more outspoken and confident about professing his love of John Lennon and the Beatles during interviews. Fisk, who produced the first version of the song, said that the recording featured \"Total Lennon harmonies, right out of \"Rubber Soul\"\". Azerrad wrote that Cobain's vocals were \"draped in most un-Sub Pop-like harmonies,\" a reference to Nirvana's then-record label, best known for their heavier grunge sound that defined most of \"Bleach\", with the exception of \"About a Girl.\" English musician Tim Arnold described the song as part of Nirvana's post-\"Bleach\" \"political thrust to the top of the charts.\"\n\nIn his review of \"Incesticide\" for \"AllMusic\", Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited \"the terrific forgotten indie pop tune 'Been a Son'\" as one of the compilation's highlights.\n\nIn 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" named \"Been a Son\" the 23rd best Nirvana song in their \"No Apologies: All 102 Nirvana Songs Ranked\" list.

{"id": "2114995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2114995", "title": "Dextromethorphan", "text": "Dextromethorphan\n\nDextromethorphan (DXM or DM) is a medication most often used as a cough suppressant in over-the-counter cold and cough medicines. It is sold in syrup, tablet, spray, and lozenge forms.\n\nIt is in the morphinan class of medications with sedative, dissociative, and stimulant properties (at lower doses). Dextromethorphan posseses only a minimal degree of the mu-opioid activity typical of morphinan compounds and exerts its therapeutic effects through several other receptors. In its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as a white powder.\n\nDXM is also used recreationally. When exceeding approved dosages, dextromethorphan acts as a dissociative hallucinogen. It has multiple mechanisms of action, including actions as a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a sigma-1 receptor agonist. DXM and its major metabolite, dextrorphan, also block glutamate receptors at high doses, which produces effects similar to, yet distinct from, the dissociative states created by other dissociative anesthetics such as ketamine, nitrous oxide, and phencyclidine.\n\nIt was patented in 1949 and approved for medical use in 1953.\n\nThe primary use of dextromethorphan is as a cough suppressant, for the temporary relief of cough caused by minor throat and bronchial irritation (such as commonly accompanies the flu and common cold), as well as those resulting from inhaled particle irritants. However, controlled studies have found the symptomatic effectiveness of dextromethorphan similar to placebo.\n\nIn 2010, the FDA approved the combination drug dextromethorphan/quinidine for the treatment of Pseudobulbar affect (uncontrollable laughing/crying). Dextromethorphan is the actual therapeutic agent in the combination; quinidine merely serves to inhibit the enzymatic degradation of dextromethorphan and thereby increase its circulating concentrations via inhibition of CYP2D6.\n\nIn 2013, a randomized clinical trial was conducted at Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in Tabriz, Iran, that indicated dextromethorphan may help reduce the overall discomfort and duration of withdrawal symptoms associated with opioid use disorder. When combined with clonidine, dextromethorphan reduced the overall time needed for withdrawal symptoms to peak by 24 hours while also reducing the severity of the symptoms compared to clonidine alone.\n\nThe combination medicine dextromethorphan/bupropion is in clinical trials by Axsome Theraputics for major depressive disorder, with fast tracked designation granted by the FDA in 2017. The combination showed positive results in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials.\n\nBecause dextromethorphan can trigger a histamine release (allergic reaction), atopic children, who are especially susceptible to allergic reactions, should be administered dextromethorphan only if absolutely necessary, and only under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.\n\nSide effects of dextromethorphan at normal therapeutic doses can include:\n\nA rare side effect is respiratory depression.\n\nDextromethorphan had been thought to cause Olney's lesions when administered intravenously; however, this was later proven inconclusive, due to lack of research on humans. Tests were performed on rats, giving them 50 mg or more every day for as long as a month. Neurotoxic changes, including vacuolation, have been observed in posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices of rats administered other NMDA receptor antagonists such as PCP, but not with dextromethorphan.\n\nIn many documented cases, dextromethorphan has produced psychological dependence in people who used it recreationally. However, it does not produce physical addiction, according to the WHO Committee on Drug Dependence. It is considered less addictive than the other common weak opiate cough suppressant, codeine. Since dextromethorphan also acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, users describe that regular recreational use over a long period of time can cause withdrawal symptoms similar to those of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. Additionally, disturbances have been reported in sleep, senses, movement, mood, and thinking.\n\nAdverse effects of dextromethorphan in overdose at doses 3 to 10 times the recommended therapeutic dose:\n\nAt doses 15 to 75 times the recommended therapeutic dose:\n\nEpisodic acute psychosis can occur with high doses of DXM taken for recreational use, and an abundance of psychiatric symptoms can result, including dissociation and other PCP-like symptoms.\n\nDextromethorphan should not be taken with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) due to the potential for serotonin syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur rapidly, due to a buildup of an excessive amount of serotonin in the body.\n\nPatients who are taking dextromethorphan should exercise caution when drinking grapefruit juice or eating grapefruit, as compounds in grapefruit affect a number of drugs, including dextromethorphan, through the inhibition of the cytochrome P450 system in the liver, and can lead to excessive accumulation of the drug which both increases and prolongs effects. Grapefruit and grapefruit juices (especially white grapefruit juice, but also including other citrus fruits such as bergamot and lime, as well as a number of noncitrus fruits) generally are recommended to be avoided while using dextromethorphan and numerous other medications.\n\nDextromethorphan has been found to possess the following actions (<1 μM) using rat tissues:\n\n\nDextromethorphan is a prodrug of dextrorphan, which is the actual mediator of most of its dissociative effects through acting as a more potent NMDA receptor antagonist than dextromethorphan itself. What role, if any, (+)-3-methoxymorphinan, dextromethorphan's other major metabolite, plays in its effects is not entirely clear.\n\nFollowing oral administration, dextromethorphan is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, where it enters the bloodstream and crosses the blood–brain barrier.\n\nAt therapeutic doses, dextromethorphan acts centrally (meaning that it acts on the brain) as opposed to locally (on the respiratory tract). It elevates the threshold for coughing, without inhibiting ciliary activity. Dextromethorphan is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and converted into the active metabolite dextrorphan in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6. The average dose necessary for effective antitussive therapy is between 10 and 45 mg, depending on the individual. The International Society for the Study of Cough recommends \"an adequate first dose of medication is 60 mg in the adult and repeat dosing should be infrequent rather than the recommended.\"\n\nDXM has an elimination half-life of approximately 4 hours in individuals with an extensive metabolizer phenotype; this is increased to approximately 13 hours when DXM is given in combination with quinidine. The duration of action after oral administration is about three to eight hours for dextromethorphan hydrobromide, and 10 to 12 hours for dextromethorphan polistirex. Around one in 10 of the Caucasian population has little or no CYP2D6 enzyme activity, leading to long-lived high drug levels.\n\nThe first pass through the hepatic portal vein results in some of the drug being metabolized by O-demethylation into an active metabolite of dextromethorphan called dextrorphan (DXO). DXO is the 3-hydroxy derivative of dextromethorphan. The therapeutic activity of dextromethorphan is believed to be caused by both the drug and this metabolite. Dextromethorphan also undergoes N-demethylation (to 3-methoxymorphinan or MEM), and partial conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfate ions. Hours after dextromethorphan therapy, (in humans) the metabolites (+)-3-hydroxy-N-methylmorphinan, (+)-3-morphinan, and traces of the unchanged drug are detectable in the urine.\n\nA major metabolic catalyst involved is the cytochrome P450 enzyme known as 2D6, or CYP2D6. A significant portion of the population has a functional deficiency in this enzyme and are known as poor CYP2D6 metabolizers. O-demethylation of DXM to DXO contributes to at least 80% of the DXO formed during DXM metabolism. As CYP2D6 is a major metabolic pathway in the inactivation of dextromethorphan, the duration of action and effects of dextromethorphan can be increased by as much as three times in such poor metabolizers. In one study on 252 Americans, 84.3% were found to be \"fast\" (extensive) metabolizers, 6.8% to be \"intermediate\" metabolizers, and 8.8% were \"slow\" metabolizers of DXM. A number of alleles for CYP2D6 are known, including several completely inactive variants. The distribution of alleles is uneven amongst ethnic groups.\n\nA large number of medications are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6. Some types of medications known to inhibit CYP2D6 include certain SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants, some antipsychotics, and the commonly available antihistamine diphenhydramine. Therefore, the potential of interactions exists between dextromethorphan and medications that inhibit this enzyme, particularly in slow metabolizers.\n\nDXM is also metabolized by CYP3A4. N-demethylation is primarily accomplished by CYP3A4, contributing to at least 90% of the MEM formed as a primary metabolite of DXM.\n\nA number of other CYP enzymes are implicated as minor pathways of DXM metabolism. CYP2B6 is actually more effective than CYP3A4 at N-demethylation of DXM, but, since the average individual has a much lower CYP2B6 content in his/her liver relative to CYP3A4, most N-demethylation of DXM is catalyzed by CYP3A4.\n\nDextromethorphan is the dextrorotatory enantiomer of levomethorphan, which is the methyl ether of levorphanol, both opioid analgesics. It is named according to IUPAC rules as (+)-3-methoxy-17-methyl-9α,13α,14α-morphinan. As its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as an odorless, opalescent white powder. It is freely soluble in chloroform and insoluble in water; the hydrobromide salt is water-soluble up to 1.5 g/100 mL at 25 °C. Dextromethorphan is commonly available as the monohydrated hydrobromide salt, however some newer extended-release formulations contain dextromethorphan bound to an ion-exchange resin based on polystyrene sulfonic acid. Dextromethorphan's specific rotation in water is +27.6° (20 °C, Sodium D-line).\n\nThe racemic parent compound racemorphan was first described in a Swiss and US patent application from Hoffmann-La Roche in 1946 and 1947, respectively; a patent was granted in 1950. A resolution of the two isomers of racemorphan with tartaric acid was published in 1952, and DXM was successfully tested in 1954 as part of US Navy and CIA-funded research on nonaddictive substitutes for codeine. DXM was approved by the FDA in 1958 as an over-the-counter antitussive. As had been initially hoped, DXM was a solution for some of the problems associated with the use of codeine phosphate as a cough suppressant, such as sedation and opiate dependence, but like the dissociative anesthetics phencyclidine and ketamine, DXM later became associated with nonmedical use.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, dextromethorphan became available in an over-the-counter tablet form by the brand name Romilar. In 1973, Romilar was taken off the shelves after a burst in sales because of frequent misuse. A few years later, products with an unpleasant taste were introduced (such as Robitussin, Vicks-44, and Dextrotussion), but later the same manufacturers began producing products with a better taste. The advent of widespread internet access in the 1990s allowed users to rapidly disseminate information about DXM, and online discussion groups formed around use and acquisition of the drug. As early as 1996, DXM HBr powder could be purchased in bulk from online retailers, allowing users to avoid consuming DXM in syrup preparations. As of January 1, 2012, dextromethorphan is prohibited for sale to minors in the State of California and in the State of Oregon as of January 1, 2018, except with a doctor's prescription. Several other states have also began regulating sales of dextromethorphan to minors.\n\nIn Indonesia, the National Agency of Drug and Food Control (BPOM-RI) prohibited single-component dextromethorphan drug sales with or without prescription. Indonesia is the only country in the world that makes single-component dextromethorphan illegal even by prescription and violators may be prosecuted by law. National Anti-Narcotics Agency (BNN RI) has even threatened to revoke pharmacies' and drug stores' licenses if they still stock dextromethorphan, and will notify the police for criminal prosecution. As a result of this regulation, 130 drugs have been withdrawn from the market, but drugs containing multicomponent dextromethorphan can be sold over the counter. In its official press release, BPOM-RI also stated that dextromethorphan is often used as a substitute for marijuana, amphetamine, and heroin by drug abusers, and its use as an antitussive is less beneficial nowadays.\n\nIt may be used in generic labels and store brands, Benylin DM, Mucinex DM, Camydex-20 tablets, Robitussin, NyQuil, Dimetapp, Vicks, Coricidin, Delsym, TheraFlu, Charcoal D, Cinfatós and others. It has been used in counterfeit medications.\n\nDXM Pharmaceuticals sells a highly concentrated product called \"RoboCough,\" which is marketed for travel, but may have common use recreationally.\n\nOver-the-counter preparations containing dextromethorphan have been used in manners inconsistent with their labeling, often as a recreational drug. At doses much higher than medically recommended, DXM and its major metabolite, dextrorphan, acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which produces dissociative hallucinogenic states somewhat similar to ketamine and phencyclidine. It may produce distortions of the visual field – feelings of dissociation, distorted bodily perception, excitement, and a loss of sense of time. Some users report stimulant-like euphoria, particularly in response to music. Dextromethorphan usually provides its recreational effects in a non-linear fashion, so that they are experienced in significantly varied stages. These stages are commonly referred to as \"plateaus\". These plateaus are numbered from one to four, with the first having the mildest effects to fourth being the most intense. Each plateau is said to come with different related effects and experiences. Teens tend to have a higher likelihood to use dextromethorphan-related drugs as they are easier to access, and an easier way to cope with psychiatric disorders.\n\nDextromethorphan/quinidine is also under investigation for the treatment of a variety of other neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions besides pseudobulbar affect, such as agitation associated with Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder.\n\n\n"}

His grandfather, father and uncle, Thomas Michael Greenhow, were all physicians. Initially a surgeon, Greenhow and his uncle Thomas were both members of the North of England Medical Association; Edward being president in 1841. Edward Headlam Greenhow practiced for eighteen years in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and did much work on sanitation, becoming a member of the Town Council of Tynemouth and chairman of the Board of Health.\n\nIn 1852 Greenhow graduated as M.D. at King's College, University of Aberdeen, and in 1853 established himself in London as a consulting physician. For some years he was largely engaged in work connected with public health, being appointed lecturer on this subject at St. Thomas's Hospital (the first appointment of the kind in the country). Across the road was Guy's Hospital. There Greenhow became acquainted with Thomas Addison, and saw the patients mentioned in Addison's book before they died. He also met William Gull, who with William Baly ran the Cholera Committee.\n\nAn inquiry Greenhow undertook into mortality from diseases in certain districts in England, for his lectures, was published as a parliamentary paper by John Simon, medical officer of the Board of Health. The facts gathered in this inquiry were made the basis of future work arising out of the Public Health Act 1858, when Simon was medical officer to the Privy Council. Greenhow was engaged for inquiries into diphtheria (1859) and pulmonary disease among operatives (miners, grinders, flax-dressers, etc.), with a report on this latter subject (1860–1861) being of wide interest. Simon resigned in 1876 as Chief Medical Officer to the Privy Council, and the post was abolished: Greenhow had lost an ally. Simon and Greenhow were persuaded that cleanliness led to health, and that pollution, such as in Liverpool, was the cause of the plagues of typhoid and Asiatic cholera in Britain. The government used William Henry Duncan to undermine the conclusions of Greenhow.\n\nGreenhow's various reports as Medical Officer of the Privy Council were instrumental in the emancipation of children, beginning in 1867 with a change to the Workshop Regulation Act. This made it illegal to employ children under the age of eight.\n\nIn 1859 Greenhow became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and in 1861 was elected assistant physician to the Middlesex Hospital and lecturer on the subjects of public health and medical jurisprudence in the medical school. In 1871 he became physician and lecturer on medicine; on his retirement from the acting staff in 1880 he was elected consulting physician to the hospital.\n\nGreenhow was a Fellow of the Royal Society (1870) and a member of many medical societies. In 1879–1881 he was president of the Clinical Society of London, whe had shared in founding in 1867. He was the author of works on diphtheria, chronic bronchitis, and on Addison's disease, the subject of his Croonian lectures (1875). The lectures became the subject of a second book on Addison's disease, and Greenhow delivered the lecture on Addison's disease at the International Medical Congress of 1881: he had had eleven patients of his own. He had pioneered treatment with iron and effervescing medicine which engineered a remission, and so prolonged life.\n\nGreenhow served on more than one Royal Commission, of which Lord Kimberley (Earl of Kimberley) was chairman. He was the medical officer to the Pensions Commutation Board from its formation in 1870 until the day of his death.\n\nIn May 1859, Greenhow held the Chair of the Epidemiological Society of London, the establishment which had anaesthetist John Snow as one of its founders. Greenhow and Snow were the most \"outstanding practitioners\" at Newcastle Infirmary, which would eventually become a medical school, established by Greenhow's uncle, surgeon Dr Thomas Michael Greenhow. Snow's \"Case Books\" record that in November 1857, Greenhow was living and working in London and present whilst Snow gave chloroform to a patient.\n\nGreenhow was returning to his home at Reigate on the afternoon of 22 April 1888 - after attending to his duties as medical officer to the Pensions Commutation Board - when, while at Charing Cross Station, he died suddenly.\n\nGreenhow married, in 1842, the widow of Mr. W. Barnard, by whom he had one son, the Rev. E. Greenhow, vicar of Earsdon. She died in 1857, and in 1862 he married the second daughter of Joseph Hume, M.P., by whom he had two daughters.\n\nFrances Lupton (née Greenhow), who worked to open up educational opportunities for women, was his first cousin.\n\nExcerpt from the Record of the Services of the Honorary Staff at the Middlesex Hospital:\n\n\n\n"}

He was Chief of Foreign Policy and International Relations for the BSP from 1996 to 2001. In May 2000 he was elected a Member of the BSP Supreme Council and Member of the Executive Bureau. In June 2001, he entered politics when he was elected as a member of the Bulgarian National Assembly from the region of Ruse.\n\nIn December 2001 Stanishev was elected Chairman of the BSP at the party's Congress, and also Chairman of the Parliamentary Group of the Coalition for Bulgaria following the resignation of the previous holder of these positions, Georgi Parvanov, after his victory in the 2001 presidential election. Since April 2004 Stanishev has also been a member of the presidency of the Party of European Socialists. Even though, at the beginning, older party members regarded him with suspicion due to his lack of experience, Stanishev has enjoyed considerable public approval mainly because of his successful efforts to modernise the BSP. Stanishev succeed to modernise the Bulgarian Socialist Party, leading it to a fill membership to Socialist's international and then - to member of the PES. He was elected as a member of the European Parliament for a second term in 2019.\n\nIn the general election of June 25, 2005, Stanishev was re-elected to the National Assembly, this time for a seat in Burgas. Under his leadership the Coalition for Bulgaria (a coalition dominated by the BSP) won 31% of the votes. Stanishev said that the next government \"should be led by the party which won most votes in the elections.\" On 20 July, after nearly a month of political uncertainty, Stanishev agreed to attempt to form a Cabinet. On July 27, 2005 the Bulgarian Parliament chose him as the new Prime Minister in a coalition government, led by the BSP and National Movement Simeon II in a partnership with the Movement for Rights and Freedoms. The vote was 120 to 119. However, the parliament voted against Stanishev's proposed Cabinet by 119 to 117 votes.\n\nThis was followed by another two weeks of political deadlock. Finally, on August 15, Stanishev was able to form a three-party grand coalition with the party of outgoing Prime Minister Simeon Sakskoburggotski and with the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, a Turkish minority party. Stanishev said the coalition's priorities would be \"European integration, social responsibility and economic growth.\" He was elected Prime Minister by the Bulgarian parliament on August 16 with 168 in favour and 67 against. On August 17, 2005, with an official ceremony on 1 Dondukov Boulevard, Sergei Stanishev took office as Prime Minister.\n\nSergei Stanishev is an avid pro-EU politician who is credited with reforming Bulgaria to the extent that he managed to steer his country to be among the last group of countries which joined the EU. Stanishev said Bulgaria's entrance to the EU was the final fall of the Berlin Wall for his nation, while EU President Jose Manuel Barroso hailed Bulgaria for having \"gone through a remarkable transformation\" in order to join.\n\nThe European Commission's report on Bulgaria and Romania's accession had confirmed that after seven years of talks, Bulgaria and Romania were able to take on the rights and obligations of EU membership. Reading the report, Barroso said the two nations' entry would be a \"historic achievement\".\n\nIn June 2008 Stanishev drew criticism from human rights advocates for his remarks regarding Bulgaria's first gay pride parade; the Prime Minister said he did not approve of \"the manifestation and demonstration of such orientations.\"\n\nAlso in June 2008 \"The Guardian\" published an article highly critical of planned real estate development in a pristine seacoast area under EU environmental protection. Sergei Stanishev's brother, Georgi Stanishev, is the Bulgarian partner of Foster and Partners, the developer behind the controversial project.\n\nIn March 2009, \"New Europe\" published the heading 'Barroso backs Stanishev'. Stanishev received the full support of European Commissions President Jose Manuel Barroso concerning the improvement of the cooperation with the European Commission and the enhancement of the administrative capacity. Prime Minister Stanishev was on a working visit to Brussels and met with President Barroso, as well as European Commissioner for Energy Andris Piebalgs and Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs Joaquin Almunia.\n\nLater in June 2009, Sergei Stanishev supported Jose Manuel Barroso for a second term as EU Commission President.\n\nStanishev took over the PES leadership as Interim President in late 2011 after his predecessor, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, stepped down from his post. In September 2012, at the 9th PES Congress, Sergei Stanishev was elected (with 91.3% of the votes) as President of PES for a full two-year term. He was the only candidate for the post.\n\nOn June 11, 2015, he was re-elected after his rival, Enrique Barón Crespo, withdrew from the race. According to him, his victory margin was 69.5% to 16.5%, with 13.3% abstaining. At the PES congress in Lisbon in 2018 Stanishev was re-elected as president of the PES.\n\nAt the 2014 European parliament election, Stanishev was elected as Member of the European Parliament for Bulgaria, placing second on the BSP party list.\n\nIn early July 2014, Stanishev announced that he would step down as leader of the BSP. On July 27, at the BSP's 48th congress, incumbent chairperson of the National Assembly Mihail Mikov was elected to succeed Stanishev as party chair.\n\nIn the 2019 European Parliament election Stanishev earned a seat as a Member of the European Parliament for the 2019–2014 term. At the summit at which EU's top jobs were discussed Stanishev was proposed as a candidate for President of the European Parliament. However, he withdrew his nomination. Boyko Borisov, Prime Minister of Bulgaria, said Stanishev's nomination was an \"honor and pride for Bulgaria\". According to Euractiv, Stanishev is \"at war\" with the leader of the Bulgarian socialists Korneliya Ninova. \n\nIn March 2012, scandalous Austrian lobbyist Peter Hochegger was found to have received nearly €1.5 M from the former three-way coalition government for a dubious campaign aimed at boosting Bulgaria's image abroad. A report indicated that a part of the sum paid to Hochegger's company had returned to the PR agency owned by Monika Yosifova, now Stanisheva, wife of Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev. Hochegger made headlines in Bulgaria after it emerged that he had lobbied for Bulgaria's EU accession in exchange for a fee of €1.5 M under two contracts from 2006 and 2008 signed during the term in office of the government headed by Stanishev. The Viennese Regional Criminal Court sentenced Hochegger to two and a half years in prison.\n\nA public relations firm led by Stanishev's wife, Monika Stanisheva, won a €60,000 contract for a project to the European elections in Bulgaria. MEPs from the EPP have rang the alarm bell an \"obvious\" conflict of interest involving some of the most prominent figures in the European socialist family.\n\nThe project consists of a website explaining the functions of the European Parliament to a Bulgarian audience. According to experts, quoted by the Bulgarian press, the website is built on open source software and contains information copy-pasted from the EU institutions own websites. The contract will be investigated by the Budgets Committee of the European Parliament.\nStanishev defended his wife saying that she was working on similar projects before they got married in 2013. He attacked his opponents by asking if they, \"suggest that she should stop working?\".\nStanisheva has announced that she was returning the down payment of €29,679.93.\n\nSergei Stanishev faced a court on 18 March 2014 in the so-called \"lost documents\" case, which many observers and Stanishev himself have claimed as based on pure political grounds. In a written statement, he stated that \"In Bulgaria it is clear to everyone that the case against me is political.\"\n\nHe was charged with losing 7 classified documents - 3 from the State Agency for National Security (DANS), 2 from the Interior Ministry, 1 from the Defense Ministry and 1 from NATO - while he was Prime Minister. In October 2013 Stanishev voluntarily gave up his parliamentary immunity to be tried in court.\n\nIf convicted, he could have faced a two-year jail sentence or a fine.\n\nOn December 16, 2016 Stanishev was acquitted, with the judge stating that \"there were no indisputable evidence that Stanishev lost the documents, nor was it proven conclusively that the documents contained confidential information\".\n\nIn 2011, PR agent Monika Yosifova announced that she was having a baby with Stanishev. Their daughter Daria was born on May 1, 2011. Their second child Georgi was born in 2013. Yosifova is a divorcee who has two other children - Monika and Ventsislav - by her ex-husband Ventsislav Yosifov. Stanishev married Monika in May 2013.\n\nStanishev has one brother, architect Georgi Stanishev.\n\nStanishev acquired Bulgarian citizenship in 1996.\n\nHis hobbies include fitness, skiing, swimming and motorcycling.\n\n"}

It contained all of the band's original studio albums, live album and non-album tracks to that point. It was available in vinyl and cassette formats.\n\nFollowing the 1985 Live Aid concert, Queen found themselves in a creative period. While spending only 20+ minutes onstage before the whole world, some felt that Queen had stolen the show. In the wake of this unexpected turn, Mercury called on the other band members, to go into the studio and record a song together. Until this point, all but a handful of songs were written by the individual members (and occasional duo-songwriting credits): \"Stone Cold Crazy\", \"Under Pressure\" (with David Bowie) and \"Soul Brother\". The result of this enthusiastic session was \"One Vision\" and its remixed B-side \"Blurred Vision\" being released as a single worldwide.\n\nOn 2 December, EMI Records released what was then the definitive Queen boxed set: all of Queen's 11 original studio albums, their live album \"Live Killers\", and an extra disc titled \"Complete Vision\", which contained all the non-album A-sides and B-sides to that point.\nThe band signed only 600 copies (on the \"Complete Vision\" sleeve), which have now become collectors' items. This was a 14 LP box. In addition, the box included two books, the first with all the albums' artwork, lyrics and pictures; the other had a colour world map showing where Queen played and charted, and a world tour itinerary up to that time, showing a list of equipment they carried with them. Each album was digitally remastered and re-sleeved in white with an embossed crest and gold Roman numerals.\n\nNot included in the box were their 1981 \"Greatest Hits\" compilation, as well as versions and edits of tracks used for single releases worldwide. Queen released four studio albums after \"The Complete Works\"; \"A Kind of Magic\" (1986), \"The Miracle\" (1989), \"Innuendo\" (1991) and \"Made in Heaven\" (1995).\n\n\n\"Complete Vision\" is a bonus LP that came with the \"Complete Works\" boxed set in 1985 and tidied up the non-album A-sides and B-sides at the time.

{"id": "2115110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2115110", "title": "Walker Cooper", "text": "Walker Cooper\n\nWilliam Walker Cooper (January 8, 1915 – April 11, 1991) was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher from 1940 to 1957, most notably as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals with whom he won two World Series championships. An eight-time All-Star, Cooper was known as one of the top catchers in baseball during the 1940s and early 1950s. His elder brother Mort Cooper, also played in Major League Baseball as a pitcher. \n\nA native of Atherton, Missouri, Cooper was a solid defensive catcher as well as a strong hitter, making the National League All-Star team every year from 1942 to 1950. After being stuck in the Cardinals' talent-rich farm system in the late 1930s, he finally broke in with the team in late 1940 at age 25 (and reportedly complained to umpire Beans Reardon about the first pitch he saw); but a broken collarbone limited his play to 68 games in 1941. On August 30 of that year, Cooper caught Lon Warneke's no-hitter. In 1942 he batted .281, finishing among the National League's top ten players in slugging, doubles and triples as St. Louis won the pennant by two games; brother Mort won the Most Valuable Player Award. Batting fifth, he hit .286 in the World Series against the defending champion New York Yankees, driving in the winning run in Game 4 and scoring the winning run on Whitey Kurowski's home run in the ninth inning of the final Game 5; he then picked Joe Gordon off second base with no outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, as the team earned its first title in eight years.\n\nIn 1943, Cooper raised his average to a career-high .318, and was third in the National League in batting and slugging and fifth in RBI, as the Cardinals repeated as league champions; he was runnerup in the Most Valuable Player Award vote to teammate Stan Musial. In the 1943 World Series he batted .294 as the clean-up hitter, but St. Louis lost the rematch with the Yankees. In 1944 , Cooper's average dipped only slightly to .317 as the Cardinals won their third straight pennant, facing the crosstown St. Louis Browns in the World Series; again batting cleanup, he hit .318 in the Series and scored the team's first run in the final Game 6, and the Cardinals won another title. World War II service in the Navy led him to appear in only four games in 1945, and before his return, the New York Giants purchased his contract following a salary dispute in January 1946; the sale by the Cardinals for $175,000 ($ today) was the highest cash-only deal ever to that time; the transactions of Joe Cronin in and Dizzy Dean in were larger deals, but also involved other players.\n\nCooper enjoyed his most productive season at the plate in 1947, when he hit .305 and compiled career highs in home runs (35), RBI (122), runs (79), hits (157) triples (8) and games (140); the Giants set a new major league record with 221 home runs. In that season, Cooper homered in six consecutive games to tie a record set by George Kelly in . After Leo Durocher became Giants manager in 1948, he began revamping the team to emphasize speed, and Cooper was traded to the Cincinnati Reds on June 13, 1949 for fellow catcher Ray Mueller after starting the year hitting .211. Three weeks later, on July 6, Cooper became the only catcher in major league history, and one of only eleven players, to have hit 10 or more RBI in a single game; he was 6-for-7, including three home runs and five runs. That year, he also led National League catchers in assists for the only time in his career. In May 1950 he was traded to the Boston Braves, where he caught Vern Bickford's no-hitter on August 11 of that year. He remained with the Braves through their 1953 move to Milwaukee, batting over .300 in his first two seasons with the club. Cooper holds the distinction of being the last man to come to bat at Boston's Braves Field, flying out to Brooklyn's Andy Pafko.\n\nCooper signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates before the 1954 season, but was let go in May after hitting only .200; he was picked up by the Chicago Cubs, and hit well as a backup catcher and pinch-hitter through 1955. He then returned to St. Louis to spend his last two seasons as a Cardinal, ending his career in October . After his daughter, Sara (Miss Missouri 1957), married Cardinals second baseman Don Blasingame, he noted, \"You know you are getting too old when your daughter marries one of your teammates.\"\n\nIn an eighteen-year major league career, Cooper played in 1,473 games, accumulating 1,341 hits in 4,702 at bats for a .285 career batting average along with 173 home runs, 812 runs batted in, and a .464 slugging percentage. He led National League catchers three times in range factor, twice in caught stealing percentage, and once in assists, finishing with a .977 career fielding percentage. One of the sport's strongest players in his prime, at the end of his career he ranked among the top five National League catchers in career batting average (.285), slugging average (.464), home runs (173) and runs batted in (812). He also batted .300 over three World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals from 1942 to 1944 as the team won two championships, and ranked tenth in National League history in both games (1,223) and putouts (5,166) behind the plate when he retired. During his career, he set a record by hitting grand slams with five different teams (a mark subsequently tied by Dave Kingman and Dave Winfield). His .464 slugging average then placed him behind only Roy Campanella (.500) and Gabby Hartnett (.489) among players with 1,000 National League games as a catcher, and his 173 HRs and 812 RBI put him behind only Campanella (242, 856), Hartnett (236, 1,179), and Ernie Lombardi (190, 990). His elder brother, Mort Cooper, was a National League pitcher and his teammate for the first few years of his career, while his son-in-law, Don Blasingame, also was a major leaguer.\n\nAfter his playing career, he managed the Indianapolis Indians (1958–59) and Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers (1961) of the Triple-A American Association and was a coach for the 1960 Kansas City Athletics, before leaving the game.\n\nWalker Cooper died in Scottsdale, Arizona at age 76.\n\n\n\n"}

The show featured news items read by Maddow and her commentary on each of them as well as interview segments with politicians, newsmakers and pundits. Guests included presidential candidate John Edwards, author Eric Alterman, reporters from \"The Nation\" magazine and commentators from The Center for American Progress. Beginning September 8, 2008, she also debuted a TV version of the show on MSNBC of the same name with different content. Early in 2009 the show was moved to the 5AM timeslot and consisted almost entirely of the audio from the previous nights MSNBC broadcast of Maddow's television show. On January 21, 2010, Air America Radio ceased programming citing economic difficulties.\n\nThe show began on April 14, 2005 and moved to 7AM–9AM EST on January 2, 2006. It later aired weekdays from 6PM–8PM EST on some Air America affiliates. Unlike most Air America programs, listener calls were not usually taken, in keeping with the show's more hard-news orientation and its format. The only exception to the rule was when either a guest or an issue's stance was important enough to warrant the calls (e.g., Maddow took calls from caucus voters in Iowa and primary voters in New Hampshire prior to those states' presidential nominating contests in early January 2008).\n\nUntil December 14, 2007, humorist Kent Jones served as \"The Rachel Maddow Show's\" co-host, contributing odd news stories as well as having his own segment, \"Kent Jones Now!\", which aired at the end of each hour and focused on another odd news story. Jones also read the previous night's sports news during the second hour, substituting odd phrases for the word \"beat\" or \"defeated\" in the result depending on the city of the team that won — e.g. \"the San Francisco Giants Violent Femmes'd the Los Angeles Dodgers, 5-2.\" Jones typically ended his segments by saying \"Vigilance!\" forcefully, although sometimes he'd say \"Sacajawea\" in the same tone. He announced his departure at the end of the Tuesday, show of December 11, saying it was a \"business decision\" at the network. Jones later joined Maddow on the television version of \"The Rachel Maddow Show\".\n\nFrom March 10, 2008, until the debut of her television show, Maddow was a panelist on \"Race for the White House\" on MSNBC, simulcast as the first hour of the radio show, which expanded to three hours. Bender came on as co-host of the third hour and solo host for that hour when Maddow's television obligations on MSNBC conflicted with her ability to host the show.\n\nWith the debut of Maddow's nightly MSNBC program on September 8, 2008, the radio show returned to a two-hour format. The second hour was usually a rebroadcast of the previous night's television episode.\n\nEarly in 2009 \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" was moved a one-hour timeslot at 5AM Eastern Time. It began with a short introduction from Maddow followed by the audio from the previous night's MSNBC broadcast of \"The Rachel Maddow Show\". Little explanation or warning was given for this shift except for Maddow's comments that doing two shows was far too taxing.\n\n\n\nWhile the show covered plenty of serious political topics, some levity was injected via the use of snippets of dialogue, music and sound effects. They included dialogue from Homer Simpson and the movie \"Little Miss Sunshine\". The opening theme music was \"Stealing the Stock\" from the \"Ocean's Twelve\" soundtrack, as revealed in August 23, 2007's \"Ask Dr. Maddow\" segment. In addition, nearly every Friday show opened with a piece of dialogue from \"Friday\" (\"'Cuz it's Friday, you ain't got no job, and you ain't got *bleep* to do!\"). The second hour of the Friday show typically opened with a recording of Maddow's mother trying poorly to imitate the \"Friday\" dialogue obtained when sound mixer Kris LoPresto, who was given Maddow's voice mail inbox password, recorded it directly from her cell phone.\n\n\n\n"}

After the Spanish Civil War, the Millers returned to the United States and began operation of the \"Hemispheric News Service\" in New York City with Jack Fahy, a veteran of the International Brigades.

It is drawn on a papyrus reportedly discovered at Deir el-Medina in Thebes, collected by Bernardino Drovetti (known as Napoleon's Proconsul) in Egypt sometime before 1824 AD and now preserved in Turin's Museo Egizio. The map was drawn about 1150 BC by the well-known Scribe-of-the-Tomb Amennakhte, son of Ipuy. It was prepared for Ramesses IV's quarrying expedition to the Wadi Hammamat in the Eastern Desert, which exposes Precambrian rocks of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. The purpose of the expedition was to obtain blocks of \"bekhen\"-stone (metagraywacke sandstone) to be used for statues of the king.\n\nThe map shows a 15-kilometre stretch of Wadi Hammamat and has depictions of this wadi's confluence with wadis Atalla and el-Sid, the surrounding hills, the \"bekhen\"-stone quarry, and the gold mine and settlement at Bir Umm Fawakhir. It also includes numerous annotations (written in the hieratic script) identifying the features shown on the map, the destinations of the wadi routes, the distance between the quarry and mine, the location of gold deposits in the hills, and the sizes of the \"bekhen\"-stone blocks quarried. The top of the map is toward the south and the source of the Nile River. As currently reconstructed in the Turin Museum, the map measures 2.8 m long by 0.41 m wide. This arrangement of the map fragments is currently considered incorrect however. A new and more accurate reconstruction was proposed by Harrell and Brown in 1992, leading to a reduced length of 2.1 m.\n\nBesides being a topographic map of surprisingly modern aspect, the Turin Papyrus is also a geological map (the earliest known) because it accurately shows the local distribution of different rock types (with black and pink hills), the lithologically diverse wadi gravels (with brown, green and white dots), and it contains information on quarrying and mining. The draughtsman clearly and carefully distributed distinctive features in accordance with the reality of a particular area, adding clarity by the use of legends and contrasting colors. In this respect, the Turin Papyrus may be regarded as the earliest known Geographic Information System.\n\nThe location of the map on the ground has been identified and has been shown to be accurate.\n\nThe verso of the papyrus is inscribed with unrelated texts, in particular a letter addressed directly to Ramesses VI and pertaining to a cult statue of his setup in the temple of Hathor in Deir el-Medina. The letter asks that a certain man be put in charge of the daily offerings presented to the statue of the king. The request seems to have been granted as the grandson of the author still held the title of \"High Priest of Ramesses VI\".\n\nAmong origami (paper folding) enthusiasts, the map has been considered as the earliest known example of folding. According to origami historian David Lister, the map was mentioned by Profs. Koryo Miura (inventor of the Miura fold) and Masamori Sakamaki, from the University of Tokyo, in a meeting of the International Cartographic Association in 1980 as an example of early map folding. However, the vertical creases on the papyrus may not be folding marks, as believed by Miura and Sakamaki. Harrell notes that \"The map was rolled up when discovered and subsequently handled, and this explains the especially poor preservation of the rightmost portion in Figure 3, which formed the outer abraded surface of the scroll.\".\n\n"}

It is the 13th and final track on the band's second studio album, \"Nevermind\", released in September 1991. \n\nThe song begins approximately 10 minutes after the end of \"Something in the Way\" and occupies the same track. A hidden track, it is not listed in the album's artwork, and was first credited by name when it was re-released as a b-side on the album's second single, \"Come As You Are,\" in March 1992.\n\n\"Endless, Nameless\" was first performed live on January 18, 1991 at the Library 4300 in Olympia, Washington. The song was first recorded in the studio in May 1991 by Butch Vig at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, during the recording sessions for \"Nevermind\". It was recorded following a failed attempt at recording the future \"Nevermind\" single, \"Lithium,\" with Cobain instructing Vig to continue recording while he, Grohl and Novoselic began playing the song. As Vig recalled, “the rage and frustration in [Cobain's] voice was fuckin’ scary to hear, because he kind of lost it.” Vig remembered Cobain being \"really pissed off, thrashing and screaming.\" \n\nUnlike the rest of \"Nevermind\", the song was recorded live, with no overdubs added afterwards. Cobain's vocals and guitar were recorded in the middle of the room, with Cobain singing into a Shure SM57 microphone designed for conversation and not music. Vig recalled that \"we had tremendous bleed from the bass and drums all pouring into Kurt's microphone.\" According to the 1993 Nirvana biography \"Come As You Are\" by Michael Azerrad, the sound of Cobain smashing his guitar can be heard around 19:32 on the track.\n\nIn a 1991 interview with \"ICE\", Robert Smith, Geffen Records’ vice president of marketing, said \"It was kind of a joke for the band to do, as in we're not going to list it in the packaging, or mention it exists. It's for that person who plays the CD, it ends, they're walking around the house and ten minutes later... Kaboom!\" Grohl explains in \"\", \"I think the original reason for it was because \"Something in the Way\" is sort of a slow song. It's the last song on the record and most likely to be listened to by someone who would have a carousel player. So, why not screw up their little carousel deal ? The song was accidentally omitted from the first pressing of \"Nevermind\", which led to \"a heavy call from Kurt,\" according to the album's mastering engineer, Howie Weinberg, demanding that the song be present on future pressings.\n\nWhen played live, \"Endless, Nameless\" was always the final song of the set, with the band members frequently destroying their instruments and the stage during the end. The final live performance was on December 13, 1993 at Pier 48 in Seattle during the \"Live and Loud\" concert, filmed for \"MTV\". The original broadcast of the performance, on December 31, 1993, only included a noise jam at the end of the recognizable song that was not credited as \"Endless, Nameless.\" However, the jam was included as part of the song when the full show was released on DVD in September 1993.\n\nWhen Cobain was young, he was a huge fan of the Beatles and loved the way they put hidden tracks in their albums like \"Her Majesty\". He decided to put the song as a hidden track on their second album \"Nevermind\" after \"Something in the Way\"\n\nAccording to Cobain, the song's lyrics possibly include the lines \"I think I can, I know I can,\" but he himself was unsure of what he was singing.\n\nIn 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Endless, Nameless\" at number sixty on their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs.\"\n\nIn 2019, \"Vulture\" ranked \"Endless, Nameless\" at number 16, calling it \"A noise jam that’s the bitter fruit of a prolonged “Lithium” recording session.\"\n\n"}

In the narrative, he is continually engaged in deceitful magics, as when he makes a false Una to tempt the Red-Cross Knight into lust, and when this fails, conjures another image, of a squire, to deceive the knight into believing that Una was false to him.\n\nHis name is an amalgamation of the Latin words \"arch\" (first) and \"imago\". While imago is the root word of the modern English \"image\", it was originally used to describe the final form of an object, such as a ghost, echo, or fully formed idea. Thus the sorcerer's name translates as \"the first and final form,\" a variation of Alpha and Omega, a title used to describe the Judeo-Christian God.\n\nThe spelling \"archimage\" appears occasionally throughout the poem's text, however as an alternate form of the character's name, rather than a title. Percy Bysshe Shelley would later use archimage as a synonym for wizard in his poem \"Letter to Maria Gisborne\". This in turn led to Ursula K. Le Guin using the variant \"archmage\" in her novel \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" to describe the leader of a group of wizards. The term has since become common place in fantasy literature and media.\n\nOne of the character's most prominent appearances is when he disguises himself as a reverend hermit, and with the assistance of Duessa (\"Deceit\") seduces the Red-Cross Knight from Una (\"truth\"). Archimago has thus been interpreted as a symbol of religious hypocrisy, especially the rampant hypocrisy which Spenser perceived within the leadership of the Catholic church. He has also been cited as emblematic of temptation itself and as a character who presents a mutated worldview which causes the knight to doubt the reality of their faith -- the very source of their strength. \n"}

It is surrounded by a park.\n\nThe site had been the castle of the lords of Heverlee since the 12th century, but this family became impoverished and had to sell the site in 1445 to the Croÿ family from Picardy. Antoine I de Croÿ demolished the medieval castle and started works to build the current château in 1455 on the site, of which he destroyed all but one tower. His grandson, William de Croÿ, completed the works on the château in 1515, and founded a monastery on the château grounds for the Benedictine Celestines. The architectural style is in large part traditionally Flemish, with sandstone window frames and brick walls, though it has been structurally altered since 1515 and has elements of Gothic, Renaissance, and Neo Gothic architecture. Its large corner towers are typical, once surmounted by a German eagle.\n\nCharles III of Croy was the 4th and last duke, and after his death in 1612 without issue the château passed to the Arenberg family into which his sister had married, and remained in that family until the First World War.\nEven before the First World War, the 8th duke of Arenberg wanted to sell the château and its grounds to the Catholic University of Leuven, for a reasonable price. During the First World War, the château and grounds were occupied by the Germans and Austrians. The château and park were seized by the Belgian government on the outbreak of, and then after the war since the Arenberg family was considered to be German or Austrian due to their close Habsburg connection, monarchs of Austria-Hungary.

After the partitioning of the university along language lines in 1968, the château and grounds remained with the Dutch speaking half as one of the main campuses for the new, independent Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

It is with this band that he performed live for the first time, although little is left today of La Bellona's music.\n\nIn 1986 Urban was part of another band as a vocalist, Laufer, one that defined the Croatian rock scene of the early 1990s. Laufer released their first album, \"The best of\", in 1993 which spawned hits such as \"Lopov Jack\", \"Svijet za nas\" and undoubtedly their most popular song, \"Moja voda\". Urban wrote all of the lyrics and co-wrote most of the music.\n\nTheir second album, \"Pustinje\", was released in 1994, shortly after which the band disbanded due to differences over the musical vision Laufer was to follow. Laufer's greatest hits album, \"Epitaph\", was released via Croatia Records in 2004.\n\nDamir Urban released his first solo album in 1996, entitled \"Otrovna kiša\" (\"Poison Rain\"), to critical and commercial acclaim. The album produced hits such as \"Astronaut\", but the highlight of his career was yet to follow.\n\nIn 1998, he released \"Žena dijete\" (\"Woman-Child\") to even greater critical and commercial acclaim, and the album spawned a string of number ones: \"Mala truba\", \"Odlučio sam da te volim\" and \"Black Tattoo\" (which features the Split hip-hop group The Beat Fleet) all received extensive airplay. He refused to receive the Porin (Croatia's equivalent to a Grammy) for the album, as it was nominated for best alternative album and Urban believed his album to be a rock album, therefore, he considered he would be stealing a prize from real alternative artists.\n\nAfter the tremendous success of \"Žena dijete\", Urban was working on a new album entitled \"Merkur\", and two singles were released: \"Aroma Satanica\" and \"Moja\", whose video was banned from many Croatian television stations due to graphic depictions of homosexual sex. More than six years passed, and yet \"Merkur\" did not see daylight while Damir Urban wrote music for several plays. Finally, in 2004, it was announced that \"Merkur\" would be scrapped in favor of another album entitled \"Retro\" which was released that same year to mixed reviews but to commercial success.\n\n\"Retro\" is highly controversial in that it was a concept album describing the demise of a relationship because of infidelity. In fact, many argue it describes the demise of Urban's relationship with his wife at the time. Most songs describe Damir Urban's newfound love, Milica Czerny who actually wrote the lyrics to two songs on the album.\n\nUrban & 4 released their new album, \"Hello\", on 29 May 2009.\n\nUrban was named by the Zoran Milanović government to the Ministry of Culture's Expert Committee for Rock Music and Club Shows for 2016.\n"}

{"id": "2115253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2115253", "title": "Phantom (musical)", "text": "Phantom (musical)\n\nPhantom is a musical with music and lyrics by Maury Yeston and a book by Arthur Kopit. Based on Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel \"The Phantom of the Opera\", the musical was first presented in Houston, Texas in 1991.\n\nAlthough it has never appeared on Broadway and has been overshadowed by the success of the 1986 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, Yeston and Kopit's \"Phantom\" has received over 1,000 productions.\n\nYeston and Kopit had just finished the musical \"Nine\", winner of the Tony Award for \"Best Musical\" in 1982, when in 1983 they were approached by actor/director Geoffrey Holder to write a musical based on Leroux's novel. Holder had obtained the rights to musicalize the novel in America from the Leroux estate, making \"Phantom\" the only \"Phantom of the Opera\" musical to do so. Holder planned to direct. Initially, Yeston was skeptical of the project. \"I laughed and laughed... That's the worst idea in the world! Why would you want to write a musical based on a horror story?... And then it occurred to me that the story could be somewhat changed... [The Phantom] would be a Quasimodo character, an Elephant Man. Don't all of us feel, despite outward imperfections, that deep inside we're good? And that is a character you cry for.\"\n\nIn 1984, British producer Ken Hill revived his 1976 musical \"Phantom of the Opera\" in England. This was not a big threat to Holder, Kopit and Yeston, since their musical was intended to play on Broadway. The real threat emerged through an announcement in \"Variety\", where an article was published concerning plans for a musical production of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The rights to the novel were in the public domain in Great Britain. Holder only held the rights for two years in the United States and Europe before the property became public domain there as well. Yeston had completed much of the score to \"Phantom\", and Yeston, Kopit and Holder were in the process of raising money for a Broadway production when the Lloyd Webber plans were announced.\n\nAfter \"The Phantom of the Opera\" became a smash hit in London in 1986, Lloyd Webber announced a Broadway production, and Yeston's Broadway investors backed out. Yeston, Kopit and Holder reluctantly shelved their plans for \"Phantom\" and went their separate ways for a time. When Kopit saw the Lloyd Webber version of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" on Broadway, he realized that the approach he and Yeston had taken was fundamentally different and that it could still work on the musical stage. A few years later, Kopit wrote the NBC miniseries \"Hands of a Stranger\", which was successful enough that NBC approached Kopit again. Kopit rewrote the script outline of his unproduced musical \"Phantom\" into a teleplay for a four-hour two-part miniseries entitled \"The Phantom of the Opera\" and sold it to NBC, with Yeston's blessing. It was filmed at the \"Opera Garnier\", and the only music used was opera music. It starred Charles Dance, Teri Polo and Burt Lancaster and premiered on television in 1990. Kopit said, \"I told Maury to hold on. Maybe someone would see the miniseries, think it would make a good musical we'd be ready.\"\n\nThe Yeston/Kopit musical was finally produced by Theater Under the Stars in 1991 under the official title \"Phantom\". The piece has since received over 1,000 productions around the world. Yeston refers to \"Phantom\" as \"the greatest hit never to be produced on Broadway.\" Yeston and Kopit's \"Phantom\" is more operetta-like in style than Lloyd Webber's, seeking to reflect the 1890s period, and seeks to project a French atmosphere to reflect its Parisian setting. Its story hews more closely to the Leroux novel and offers a deeper exploration of the phantom's past and his relationship with Gérard Carrière, the head of the Opera House. The character Raoul does not feature at all in the story.\n\nIn January 1991, Houston Texas's Theater Under the Stars presented the premiere of the Yeston/Kopit musical, renamed simply \"Phantom\" to separate it further from Lloyd Webber's and other productions of \"Phantom of the Opera\". Richard White starred in the title role. Members of the Houston cast recorded a cast album released by RCA records.\n\nThat summer of 1991, Yeston and Kopit made a few cuts and changes to the musical. In the fall, the revised version was presented in Seattle and at the California Theatre of Performing Arts in San Bernardino California and was received warmly. In Chicago, Bill Pullinsi, Artistic Director of the Candlelight Playhouse staged the production, receiving rave reviews in publications including \"Variety\" and the \"Wall Street Journal\". This led to other editions in other cities, including 1992 productions at \"Casa Mañana\" in Fort Worth, Texas, Seaside Music Theater in Daytona Beach, and at the Westchester Broadway Theatre in Elmsford, New York, starring Robert Cuccioli in the title role; and 1993 productions at Music Theater of Wichita (Kansas), Musical Theatre Southwest in Albuquerque, New Mexico and the Gateway Playhouse in Bellport, New York.\n\nIn October and November 2007, the show played at the Westchester Broadway Theater, in Elmsford, New York, and continued from December 2007 to February 2008, featuring Robert Cuccioli reprising the title role.\n\nA 1993 Helsinki City Theatre (HKT), Helsinki, Finland, production was directed by Ritva Holmberg with choreography by Marjo Kuusela. The cast starred Sanna Saarijärvi as Christine, Oskari Katajisto as the Phantom, Kristiina Elstelä and Rea Mauranen alternately as Carlotta and Esko Nikkari as Gerard.\n\nAn Australian production was held in 1996 at Altona City Theatre in Victoria. A German-language version toured for three years in Germany. A Japanese language translation was produced by the Takarazuka Revue's Cosmos Troupe in 2004 (featuring Yoka Wao and Mari Hanafusa) and by its Flower Troupe in 2006 (featuring Sumire Haruno and Ayane Sakurano) and 2011 (featuring Tomu Ranju and Hana Ranno). The musical was performed in Tallinn, Estonia in 2007.\n\nA UK production of \"Phantom\" was staged at Ye Olde Rose and Crown Theatre Pub, Walthamstow, in 2013. It was directed by Dawn Kalani Cowle. A South Korea staging was mounted in the Korean language in 2015 at Chungmu Art Hall in Seoul, directed by Robert Johanson.\n\nThe story begins at the time of the first meeting of Erik (the Phantom) and a street singer named Christine. Erik was born and raised in the catacombs under the Paris Opera House and needs beautiful music – he cannot exist without it. Complications arise when Gérard Carrière, the company manager, loses his position as head of the Opera house and therefore cannot protect Erik any longer. Furthermore, Carlotta, the new diva and wife of the new owner of the Opera, has such a terrible voice that the Phantom is in torment. His salvation must eventually come through Christine, whose voice is so beautiful that he falls in love with her. He accepts Christine as his pupil, training her for the opera, but forbids her to see his face. Erik's rival for Christine's affection is Count Philippe de Chandon, whose influence helps Christine get a minor job with the Paris Opera, but it is Erik's training that helps her earn a place as a member of the company. When Carlotta's jealous machinations ruin Christine's debut, Erik spirits Christine to his underground lair and later takes a terrible revenge by electrocuting Carlotta.\n\nCarrière finds Christine and reveals an amazing secret: he is actually Erik's father. Emboldened by this revelation, Christine begs Erik to let her see his face, since his mother was able to look at him and smile. Reluctantly, he removes his mask (although the audience never sees his face), but Christine doesn't have the same fortitude and recoils in horror, causing Erik to go on a destructive rampage. Carrière helps the guilt-stricken Christine to escape, and later he returns to tell Erik the truth about their relationship. However, Erik has known all along that Carrière is his father and has only waited for Carrière to corroborate the fact. Erik fears that he will be captured and treated like a circus freak because of his horrendous face, but Carrière promises Erik that he will never be put on display. The police surround him, and Erik makes a failed attempt to swing to safety on a rope. With Erik dangling helplessly, the chief of police tells his men not to shoot because they \"can take him alive!\" Erik shouts out to his father for help. Carrière understands; he grabs a policeman's gun and aims at his son. Reluctantly, he fires, and the Phantom falls. Fatally wounded, Erik allows Christine to remove his mask. She now smiles and tells him \"You are music, beautiful music, and you are light to me ... you are life to me,\" and replaces the mask as he dies.\n\nThe Theatre Under the Stars cast is listed first:\n\nOther notable cast members in later productions:\n\n\n\"The New York Times\" review opined, \"Mr. Kopit's Phantom ... is no less bravura than Lord Lloyd Webber's, but he is far more affecting. Mr. Yeston's sophisticated score is the model of how a loving assortment of classical forms can make popular theater music bloom. Mr. Yeston's music charms and effervesces, valuing melodiousness and variety more than the extended leitmotif and endless bloated reprises.\" \"The News-Times\" reviewer commented: \"song for song and story for story, Yeston's score is richer and more varied, and Kopit's book provides a convincing, touching and resolved narrative that tops Webber's ambiguous ending.”\n\n\"The Los Angeles Times\" reviewer wrote, \"There is a lot more understanding of Erik than of Lloyd Webber's more furtive phantom, but also less mystique. Kopit puts in details Leroux never imagined. The humanity makes for a different kind of show that hasn't found a stylistic identity. The operetta thrust makes it an old-fashioned crowd-pleaser, but traps Yeston's music between the old and the new.\" Peter Scott-Pressland found the London production \"hum-drum\", but wrote: \"[A]s a piece of writing, Yeston's \"Phantom\" is altogether more engaging than ALW's. It is tighter, more intimate and informed by more human sympathy. ... While it doesn’t produce the kind of melodic sweep and glamour of ALW, it rises ... in the second act to genuine emotional fervour. ... Erik is altogether more engaging and believable than the Lloyd-Webber skulker.\" He stated that this makes the Beauty and the Beast theme \"credible and agonizing\", and that the father-son theme is even more \"moving in the agony of both loving and loathing the thing you have spawned.\"\n\n"}

It was first released as a hidden track on the AIDS-benefit compilation album, \"No Alternative\", in October 1993. The song was released under the title \"Verse Chorus Verse,\" but since this title is shared by another, abandoned Nirvana song, it is now referred to by its earlier title of \"Sappy.\" The same version that appeared on \"No Alternative\" was re-released as \"Sappy\" on the Nirvana rarities box set, \"With the Lights Out\", in November, 2004, with a note that it had been \"retitled 'Verse Chorus Verse' for release\" on the track list. A remixed version of the same recording appeared simply as \"Sappy\" on the 20th anniversary re-issue of \"In Utero\", the album for which it was recorded, in September, 2013. Earlier versions of the song have also been released under the title of \"Sappy.\"\n\nAccording to the official website of the Red Hot Organization, who released \"No Alternative\" as part of their AIDS benefit series, the song was unlisted \"for legal reasons.\" Despite not appearing on the track listing, the song significantly contributed to \"No Alternative\"'s popularity, with many referring to the compilation as \"the one 'with the hidden Nirvana track,'\" according to the Red Hot website. \"Sappy\" reached number 9 on the US Alternative National Airplay chart, published by the \"Billboard\" sister publication, \"Radio & Records\".\n\nOriginally recorded under the working title \"Sad\", \"Sappy\" dates back to at least 1987. The first known version of the song is a solo home demo recorded by Cobain in the late 1980s. \"Sappy\" was written by Kurt Cobain as a lament against the expectations of others.\n\nFirst recording it in the late 1980s, Cobain went on to re-record \"Sappy\" in almost every major studio session over the remainder of his life, but was never completely satisfied. The song was recorded four times in the studio, with two different drummers. The first studio version, featuring Chad Channing on drums, was recorded by Jack Endino at Reciprocal Recording in Seattle, Washington on January 2 and 3, 1990. The band spent 10 hours working on the song, with much of that time spent trying to achieve a drum sound similar to Steve Albini's, according to Endino. The second version was recorded by Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin during recording sessions from April 2 to 6, 1990, for a planned second album for Sub Pop, their label at the time, that never materialized. The third version, featuring the band's new drummer Dave Grohl, was also recorded by Vig, during the sessions for their second album and first on DGC Records, \"Nevermind\", at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, in May, 1991.\n\nAlmost two years after the \"Nevermind\" sessions, the band again recorded the track with Albini. According to Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic, \"Something just drove Kurt to keep busting it out. Maybe he thought he was going to put that song over the top. He had some kind of unattainable expectations for it, I don’t know.\"\n\nThe song remained unreleased until a fourth version was recorded by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studios in Cannon Falls, Minnesota in February, 1993, during the recording sessions for the band's third and final album, \"In Utero\". Novoselic explained that the song was again recorded because \"we liked to play that song,\" expressing satisfaction with his original bass line for the song, and saying that the song remained unchanged every time the band attempted it in the studio. As Gillian G. Gaar notes, however, the Albini-recorded version is performed in a different key and at a faster tempo than previous studio versions, features a different guitar solo and is missing the instrumental intro of some of the earlier versions.\n\nThe song was not released on the album, and appeared instead as the final, unlisted track on the compilation album, \"No Alternative\", in October, 1993. By this time it had apparently been renamed \"Verse Chorus Verse,\" but since this title is shared by an earlier, abandoned Nirvana song, it is usually called \"Sappy\" in order to avoid confusion.\n\nDespite being released as a hidden track, the song helped generate interest in \"No Alternative\".\n\nAn early track list for what would become \"In Utero\", published in Cobain's \"Journals\" in 2002, shows the song \"Verse Chorus Verse\" as the proposed 12th song on the album, immediately preceding the closing track, \"All Apologies.\" \"Verse Chorus Verse\" was also briefly considered as a title for the album. Albini expressed surprise that \"Sappy\" did not appear on \"In Utero\", remembering it as \"a pretty good song,\" but theorizing that \"it wore out its welcome on the band, apparently.\"\n\n\"Sappy\" is an alternative rock song that lasts for a duration of three minutes and twenty-four seconds. According to the sheet music published at Sheet Music Plus by BMG Rights Management, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderately fast tempo of 132 beats per minute. The song follows a basic sequence of D–B–G–A–B–C in the verses as its chord progression. The musical arrangement is crisp and piercing, featuring rhymthic hooks in addition to a fluctuating guitar solo.\n\nIn his 1993 biography \"\", Michael Azerrad described \"Sappy\" as \"a highly catchy tune about romantic entrapment.\" With melancholic vocals, Cobain a sings an elusive song about an abusive relationship, at times from the perspective of a person keeping a pet turtle.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described \"Sappy\" as one of the several \"exceptional\" songs that make \"No Alternative\" \"a worthy purchase\". In his \"Allmusic\" review of \"In Utero\", Erlewine criticized the decision to omit \"such great songs as 'Verse Chorus Verse' and 'I Hate Myself and Want to Die'...when they would have fit, even illuminated\" the album's themes. Writing for \"The Guardian\", British journalist Alexis Petridis opined, \"'Sappy' was an outtake that deserved better\" and offererd praise to song's \"melancholy potency.\" In her review of the single release, \"Slate\"s Claire stated, \"Versions of this song have been floating around YouTube for years, and even this one starts out a little fuzzy, but by the time Kurt's familiar forlorn vocals come in, you’re ready to forgive the recording any sin—it’s just good to hear his voice again.\" Sharing similar sentiments, Peter Helman of \"Stereogum\" stated, \"this is a cleaner, slightly polished up mix, and it sounds both great and heartbreaking.\" Calling the song \"one of the few white whales of Nirvana's catalogue,\" \"Rolling Stone\" writer Grayson Haver Currin described the take as \"crisp and cutting, with a guitar solo that dips and climbs and vocals that suggest irritation morphing into emancipation.\" In his review of \"With the Lights Out\", Douglas Wolk for \"The Village Voice\" remarked, \"almost all the original songs on the last two discs are on point rhythmically: The high-impact surf beat of \"Sappy\" and the Bic-flick feinting of \"Oh, the Guilt\" are Zep-grade hooks.\"\n\nIn 2013, \"Sappy\" was voted ninth on \"Rolling Stone\"s reader's poll of the top 10 Nirvana songs. In 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" listed it at number 32 on their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs. In 2019, \"The Guardian\" placed it at number 16 on their list of \"Nirvana's 20 greatest songs\".\n\n\"Sappy\" became a frequently-requested song at concerts during the band's 1994 tour of Europe, which led to it being played live for the first time in nearly four years. The song was performed for the first time live at Fabrik in Hamburg, Germany on November 13, 1989. The final live performance of \"Sappy\" took place on February 25, 1994 at Palatrussardi in Milan, Italy less than six weeks prior to Cobain's death.\n\n"}

It was developed at the University of Arizona by Lawrence Brakmo and Larry L. Peterson and introduced in 1994.\n\nTCP Vegas detects congestion at an incipient stage based on increasing Round-Trip Time (RTT) values of the packets in the connection unlike other flavors such as Reno, New Reno, etc., which detect congestion only after it has actually happened via packet loss. The algorithm depends heavily on accurate calculation of the Base RTT value. If it is too small then throughput of the connection will be less than the bandwidth available while if the value is too large then it will overrun the connection.\n\nA lot of research is going on regarding the fairness provided by the linear increase/decrease mechanism for congestion control in Vegas. One interesting caveat is when Vegas is inter-operated with other versions like Reno. In this case, performance of Vegas degrades because Vegas reduces its sending rate before Reno, as it detects congestion early and hence gives greater bandwidth to co-existing TCP Reno flows.\nTCP Vegas is one of several \"flavors\" of TCP congestion avoidance algorithms. It is one of a series of efforts at TCP tuning that adapt congestion control and system behaviors to new challenges faced by increases in available bandwidth in Internet components on networks like Internet2.\n\nTCP Vegas has been implemented in the Linux kernel, in FreeBSD and possibly in other operating systems as well.\n\n\n"}

A man of multiple talents, he originally studied at the engineering school of Columbia University and Pratt Institute. Having composed the text \"Machine Design and Descriptive Geometry\" at age 19, he went on to work as a camouflage technician during World War I. After the war he continued to work as an artist, combining technology with classicism. \n\nIn the 1920s, Sakier moved to Paris where he wrote articles on European art for American magazines and on U.S. engineering for European journals. For the fledgling international literary magazine \"Broom\", where he also served as an art director, he authored (using the family name Sacken) an essay on Mayan art. This essay stimulated the rescue of a Mayan collection from the cellar of the Trocadèro in Paris. He also worked in art direction for \"Vogue\", \"Harper's Bazaar\", and \"Modes and Manners\". During his tenure at \"Vogue\", he provided the African mask featured in Man Ray's iconic photographic \"Noire et blanche\". \nSakier worked in the medium of glassware. From 1929 until 1979, he worked as the primary consultant for Fostoria Glass Company. Sakier was also a proponent of the company's Art Deco designs.\n\nSakier was also an accomplished painter, the metier about which he was most passionate. His paintings were shown in the Julien Levy Gallery in New York City in 1932. His works include \"Red Mesa\", \"Seascape #011\", and \"Collage CO08\". After he amassed his fortune from his industrial designs, he moved permanently to Paris where he pursued this passion until his death in 1988. \n\nYale University has a George Sakier Memorial Prize for excellence in photography. The Industrial Design Department at his alma mater, Pratt Institute, awards the George Sakier Merit Scholarship to students for excellence in color theory. His glasswork is in numerous collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Cooper Hewitt, and the Birmingham Museum of Art, among others.\n\n"}

(1986–2013)\n\nThe period from 1986, when Alex Ferguson was appointed as Manchester United manager, to 2013, when he announced his retirement from football, was the most successful in the club's history. Ferguson joined the club from Aberdeen on the same day that Ron Atkinson was dismissed, and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league. Despite a second-place finish in 1987–88, the club was back in 11th place the following season. Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final replay (after a 3–3 draw) saved Ferguson's career. The following season, Manchester United claimed their first Cup Winners' Cup title and competed in the 1991 European Super Cup, beating European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1–0 in the final at Old Trafford. A second consecutive League Cup final appearance followed in 1992, in which the team beat Nottingham Forest 1–0 at Wembley Stadium. In 1993, the club won its first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, it won a second consecutive title – alongside the FA Cup – to complete the first \"Double\" in the club's history.\n\nManchester United's 1998–99 season was the most successful in English club football history as they became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League – \"The Treble\" – in the same season. Losing 1–0 going into injury time in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time. The club also won the Intercontinental Cup after beating Palmeiras 1–0 in Tokyo. Ferguson was subsequently knighted for his services to football.\n\nIn 2000, Manchester United competed in the inaugural FIFA Club World Championship in Brazil, and won the league again in the 1999–2000 and 2000–01 seasons. The team finished third in 2001–02, before regaining the title in 2002–03. They won the 2003–04 FA Cup, beating Millwall 3–0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. In the 2005–06 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade, but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup Final. The club regained the Premier League title in the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons, and completed the European double by beating Chelsea 6–5 on penalties in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in this game, overtaking previous record holder, Bobby Charlton. In December 2008, the club won the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup and followed this with the 2008–09 Football League Cup, and a third successive Premier League title, the first time any team had won three successive league titles more than once. That summer, Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record £80 million. In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2–1 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, their first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.\n\nAlex Ferguson joined Manchester United from Aberdeen on 6 November 1986, the same day that previous manager Ron Atkinson was dismissed, and immediately set about rebuilding the club's youth system. In Ferguson's first game in charge, the team lost 2–0 to Oxford United; his first victory came on 22 November 1986, a 1–0 defeat of Queens Park Rangers at Old Trafford. Over the next few weeks, results continued to improve, and on Boxing Day 1986, the team beat Liverpool 1–0 at Anfield – the club's only away league win of the season, and the only home defeat of the season for their hosts. United's improvement continued throughout the season, despite no new signings being made, and they finished 11th in a First Division where Everton finished champions and Liverpool runners-up, representing the Merseyside dominance of English football which had lasted across two decades with Liverpool and over the last four seasons with Everton.\n\nThat summer, Ferguson made his first signings: defender Viv Anderson from Arsenal, and striker Brian McClair from Celtic. Ferguson also made bids to sign Stuart Pearce from Nottingham Forest and Peter Beardsley from Newcastle United, but both offers were rejected. The following season, Manchester United finished runners-up in the league, nine points behind champions Liverpool, giving supporters cause to be optimistic for the 1988–89 season. These hopes were strengthened by the return of Mark Hughes two years after his departure to Barcelona; his £1.8 million fee that took him back to Old Trafford was United's record signing. United also signed Scottish goalkeeper Jim Leighton from Aberdeen and 17-year-old winger Lee Sharpe from Torquay United, but were pipped to midfielder Paul Gascoigne by Tottenham Hotspur in the first £2 million signing by a British club.\n\nAfter suffering a number of injuries to first-team players in the 1988–89 season, Ferguson introduced a host of young players into the team – including Sharpe as well as Russell Beardsmore (who inspired United to a 3–1 win over Liverpool on New Year's Day 1989). A six-match winning run beginning in January saw the club rise to third place in February, but it finished the season in 11th after a slump set in during the seasons' final quarter. The champions this time were Arsenal, who had re-emerged as a leading force in the English game since the appointment of former United player George Graham as manager, while Liverpool finished runners-up in the league but won the FA Cup, and Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest finished third and won the League Cup. More worryingly, United finished below the likes of Norwich City, Coventry City and Millwall.\n\nFerguson responded that summer by strengthening his squad with expensive signings in the shape of midfielders Neil Webb and Mike Phelan, followed by a club record £2.3 million signing of defender Gary Pallister and lower fees for winger Danny Wallace and midfielder Paul Ince in the early stages of the 1989–90 season. The continuing changes in the United squad had just seen the sale of two players who had been the centerpiece of the Atkinson era – Paul McGrath and Norman Whiteside. While McGrath would continue playing top-flight football into the late 1990s, Whiteside would play for just two more years before continuing injury problems finally forced him to hang up his boots at the age of just 26.\n\nIn September 1989, the club received a takeover bid by Michael Knighton; chairman Martin Edwards agreed to sell the club to Knighton for £20 million, but the deal fell through when his financial backers pulled out. The season had started with United in fine form, beating defending champions Arsenal 4–1 at home on the opening day of the season, but disappointing results soon followed and by the turn of 1990, United stood 17th in the league – just one place above the relegation zone. It was now 23 years since United had been league champions, but one respected sports journalist in \"The Times\" was keen to point out in January 1990 that it would now appear more relevant that it had been 16 years since United had last been relegated.\n\nBy November 1989, newspaper reports suggested that Ferguson was on the verge of being sacked, although the United board denied that the manager's job was at risk; despite naturally disappointed with the lack of success in the league, they understood the reasons – namely the lengthy absence of key players including Bryan Robson and Neil Webb through injury. but victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final replay (after a 3–3 draw) saved his career. However, the club finished 13th, their lowest league placing since returning to the top flight in 1975; just five points separated them from the relegation zone. Liverpool were league champions that season for an English record 18th time.\n\nWith the ban on English clubs in European competitions now lifted after five years, the FA Cup success qualified the team to compete in the 1990–91 European Cup Winners' Cup; Manchester United reached the final, in which the club beat Barcelona 2–1 at De Kuip in Rotterdam, becoming the first English club to win a European trophy since the Heysel disaster had forced English clubs into a five-year ban from European competition. United's league form improved in 1990–91 with a sixth-place finish, and their defence of the FA Cup ended in the fifth round, with a 2–1 loss against Norwich City. The club reached the 1991 League Cup Final, but lost to Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nIn June 1991, Manchester United floated on the London Stock Exchange, with a valuation of £18 million, raising £6.7 million.\n\nNew to the United squad for the 1991–92 season were goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and defender Paul Parker, but the big news of the season was the breakthrough of teenage winger Ryan Giggs, who had made his debut the previous season and played in most of United's games in 1991–92. Strong performances from Schmeichel, Parker, Giggs and established players like Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister, Mark Hughes, Brian McClair and the veteran Bryan Robson helped United take an early lead in the title race, and by Christmas the title race was looking increasingly like a two-horse race between Manchester United and a resurgent Leeds United, with pre-season favourites Arsenal and Liverpool failing to impress. United ended 1991 with just one league defeat of the season to their name, but then lost 4–1 at home to unfashionable Queens Park Rangers on New Year's Day, and over the next three months goals dried up and United dropped points against the likes of Coventry City, Wimbledon, Notts County and Luton Town – teams they had been widely expected to beat. United were constantly linked with the signature of 21-year-old Southampton striker Alan Shearer, but the player refused to consider a transfer from the South Coast club until the end of the season, and so United went into the final stages of the title race with a tough battle on their hands, although a few disappointing results for Leeds United meant that the race was still wide open with just two weeks of the season remaining.\n\nWith three games to go, United were one point behind league leaders Leeds United, but the West Yorkshire club had played a game more. United then travelled to a West Ham United side heading for relegation and knew that a victory would put the title race in their hands and the end of the 25-year wait was potentially just four days away – and could be won on the home soil of their fierce rivals Liverpool. But United lost 1–0. On 26 April 1992, the team lost 2–0 to Liverpool at Anfield and Leeds (spearheaded by former United midfielder Gordon Strachan, who had joined them in March 1989 when they were still in the Second Division) secured the league title. However, the team had won the League Cup two weeks earlier, defeating Nottingham Forest 1–0 in the final. At the end of the season, 18-year-old Welsh winger Ryan Giggs was voted PFA Young Player of the Year.\n\nAfter a shortage of goals in the second half of the 1991–92 season cost United the league title, Ferguson was intent on signing a new striker. His key target was the Southampton striker Alan Shearer, but he lost out to a newly promoted Blackburn Rovers side now managed by Kenny Dalglish, who had managed Liverpool to three league titles and was now backed by the millions of steel baron Jack Walker in the quest to bring similar success to the resurgent Lancashire club. Ferguson then switched his attention to Dion Dublin, the 23-year-old striker who had excelled in the lower divisions with Cambridge United. A week before the new Premier League season began, Dublin completed a £1 million move to Old Trafford to become United's only close season signing.\n\nDublin arrived at Old Trafford as Mark Robins was sold to Norwich City. Still only 22, Robins had been instrumental in United's FA Cup triumph two years earlier, but had rarely featured in the 1991–92 season. He signed for a side who were among the pre-season favourites for relegation from the new Premier League, but few people could have imagined at the time that Robins would go on to be top scorer for one of United's biggest rivals in the race for the title.\n\nUnited's first Premier League game was a disappointing 2–1 defeat at unfancied Sheffield United, and days later they lost 3–0 at home to an Everton side who over the last few seasons had gradually drifted out of the league's top reaches. The first victory of the league season came at the fourth attempt when a late goal by Dublin gave them a 1–0 win at Southampton, but Dublin then broke his leg in the next game against Crystal Palace and was sidelined for sixth months. Some decent results including wins over Leeds United and Nottingham Forest followed, but by late October United had endured a run of five successive draws and the all too familiar goal shortage was attributed to this once again. Defeats against Wimbledon and Ron Atkinson's Aston Villa saw United occupy 10th place in the league by 7 November 1992, with one of the lowest goal tallies in the division. Over the next couple of weeks, United were linked with moves for some of the most highly regarded strikers in the English league, including Brian Deane and David Hirst, but on 26 November 1992 United made a £1.1 million move for French striker Eric Cantona, who had helped Leeds United win the previous season's league title. The arrival of Cantona helped transform United's fortunes, and by the turn of 1993 they were looking like title contenders again. Despite challenges from Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers and surprise contenders Norwich City, United went on a storming run during the final weeks of the season to win the title by a 10-point margin and end their 26-year wait. United were actually confirmed as champions without kicking a ball, when on 2 May 1993 their last remaining contenders Aston Villa surprisingly lost 1–0 at home to unfancied Oldham Athletic, who had given United a serious challenge in the FA Cup semi-finals three seasons earlier and would do so again the following season.\n\nUnited broke the English transfer fee record over the summer of 1993 by paying relegated Nottingham Forest £3.75 million for Irish midfielder Roy Keane. United started the following season with Wembley glory, beating Arsenal on penalties in the FA Charity Shield after a 1–1 draw. Manchester United led the Premier League at the end of August, a lead they maintained all season. By the end of October, they were 11 points ahead and their lead peaked at 16 points in the new year. Despite a second round exit from the UEFA Champions League, they were on a strong run in the League Cup and after beating Sheffield United in the FA Cup third round on 9 January 1994, United now had their sights set on a unique domestic treble. The club then endured sadness later that month with the death of Sir Matt Busby.\n\nIn March 1994, United dropped points against Arsenal and bottom-of-the-table Swindon Town, in which Cantona was sent off in both games and subsequently received a five-match suspension. They then lost the League Cup final to Aston Villa and in April were beaten by Blackburn Rovers and Wimbledon, which meant that they were now ahead of Blackburn Rovers only on goal difference. They very nearly went out of the FA Cup in the semi-final at Wembley, before Mark Hughes scored a late equaliser to force a Maine Road replay, which United won 4–1. An upturn in results soon followed, and United clinched their title on 1 May 1994 when they won 2–1 at Ipswich Town.\n\nCantona finished the season with 25 goals in all competitions and was subsequently voted PFA Players' Player of the Year. Other players to impress during this campaign included Mark Hughes, Paul Ince, Ryan Giggs and Lee Sharpe. It was the last season at Old Trafford for club captain Bryan Robson after 13 years and more than 400 appearances; he had accepted an offer to manage Middlesbrough. Also on their way out of the club that summer were Les Sealey (the goalkeeping hero of the 1990 FA Cup final replay who had later returned as Peter Schmeichel's understudy), Mike Phelan and long-serving utility player Clayton Blackmore.\n\nIn the 1994 FA Cup Final on 14 May, it was goalless at half time but two Cantona penalties and subsequent goals from Mark Hughes and Brian McClair gave United a comprehensive 4–0 win over Chelsea and saw them match Tottenham's record of eight FA Cup triumphs. Ferguson felt that his current squad were good enough to challenge on all fronts in the season which followed the Double, and made only one close-season signing, paying Blackburn Rovers £1.2 million for defender David May, seeing the 24-year-old as a potential eventual successor to the ageing Steve Bruce. United were also linked with a move for the high-scoring young Norwich striker Chris Sutton, but the player then signed for Blackburn in English football's first £5 million transfer.\n\nThe 1994–95 season saw United rarely out of the headlines, though on occasion they were not always the type of headlines that were welcome. On 25 January 1995, Eric Cantona kicked Matthew Simmons, a Crystal Palace hooligan who had taunted him with anti-French racist abuse after being sent off in a January fixture at Selhurst Park. Cantona was immediately suspended by the club for the rest of the season, a ban which The Football Association extended until the end of September that year, and he also received a 14-day prison sentence at his trial, although this was reduced to a community service order on appeal two months later.\n\nUnited were also without players like Paul Parker, Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis for long periods of time due to injury. 1994–95 also saw the debuts of promising young players Paul Scholes and Phil Neville. Scholes was particularly impressive, scoring five goals in 17 games. Having made a handful of appearances between them in the previous two seasons, Gary Neville, David Beckham and Nicky Butt all made more regular appearances for United during 1994–95.\n\nUnited broke the English transfer record again on 10 January 1995 by paying £7 million (£6 million in cash plus winger Keith Gillespie, who was valued at £1 million) for Newcastle United's free-scoring striker Andy Cole. He had been signed just two weeks before the Cantona incident as an eventual replacement for 31-year-old Mark Hughes, who was subject of interest from Everton at the time of Cole's arrival, but with Cantona suspended it was Hughes who ended up being Cole's partner for the rest of the season. Cole did not take long to make an impact at Old Trafford, bagging five in a Premier League record 9–0 win over Ipswich Town at Old Trafford two months after joining the club, and finding the net a total of 12 times for United by the end of the season. However, he was unable to participate in the club's FA Cup run, having already been selected by Newcastle in the competition.\n\nThe season had already brought some impressive results, including a \"double\" over fellow title challengers Blackburn Rovers and a 5–0 home win over Manchester City in the Manchester derby, and even after Cantona's suspension there were some more impressive victories over the likes of Wimbledon, Arsenal and Leicester City, but United also dropped crucial points against the likes of Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea, which left their title hopes looking slim by mid-April. However, a run of three victories and a couple of blunders by Blackburn kept the title race going right to the wire.\n\nUnited almost made it three league titles in a row, but just couldn't get the better of a West Ham side who held them to a 1–1 draw in East London on the final day of the season. The FA Cup also slipped out of United's grasp when they lost 1–0 to unfancied Everton in the final at Wembley. This left United without a major trophy for the first time since 1989.\n\nJust before the end of the 1994–95 season, United announced the demolition of the North Stand and the construction of a new stand seating more than 26,000 fans in its place, which would be completed within 12 months. There was optimism for the future as United's promising youngsters won the FA Youth Cup, and after three months of speculation about his future – with Internazionale being strongly linked with his signature – Eric Cantona put an end to speculation that he would be leaving Old Trafford by signing a new three-year contract at the end of April.\n\nAfter Eric Cantona's decision to stay with Manchester United, Internazionale turned their attention to United midfielder Paul Ince, who finally agreed to sign for the Italian giants for £7.5 million on 22 June 1995. The next day, the sale of striker Mark Hughes to Chelsea was announced. Shortly afterwards, unsettled winger and top scorer Andrei Kanchelskis was put on the transfer list, and was subsequently sold to Everton. Alex Ferguson came under intense pressure from media and fans for selling three key players after the disappointing end to the 1994–95 season, with the \"Manchester Evening News\" even conducting a survey asking its readers whether or not Ferguson should be sacked.\n\nThe pressure mounted on Ferguson as the new season began without a major signing, with Ferguson instead putting his faith in young members of the squad such as David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt. This was seen as a big gamble, especially as the likes of Newcastle United, Liverpool and Arsenal had spent heavily in the close season. Alan Hansen famously proclaimed: \"you can't win anything with kids\" on \"Match of the Day\" on 19 August 1995, after United lost 3–1 at Aston Villa. The club defied this prediction with subsequent excellent performances and just one more defeat before mid-December, although a 3–1 defeat at Leeds United on Christmas Eve left them 10 points behind leaders Newcastle, their fifth successive winless match. Aside a New Year's Day defeat at Tottenham Hotspur and a goalless draw at home to Aston Villa, United regained their winning touch after Christmas and reached the top of the Premier League in mid-March, just after an Eric Cantona goal had given them a 1–0 win at Newcastle. Cantona was instrumental in subsequent victories, and despite a 3–1 defeat at Southampton in mid-April, United remained firmly in control at the top and sealed the title on the last day of the season with a 3–0 win at Bryan Robson's Middlesbrough. A week later, Manchester United beat Liverpool 1–0 in the FA Cup final to become the first ever English club to win the league/FA Cup Double twice. Eric Cantona, who scored 19 goals in 1995–96 (including the FA Cup final winner), was voted FWA Footballer of the Year by football journalists and was made team captain following the departure of Steve Bruce to Birmingham City.\n\nUnited once again tried to sign Alan Shearer over the summer of 1996, but they were beaten to his signature by Newcastle United for a then world record fee of £15 million. A new striker did arrive at Old Trafford that summer – Ole Gunnar Solskjær, a little-known 23-year-old Norwegian striker who arrived at Old Trafford the day before Shearer signed for Newcastle. Another Norwegian, defender Ronny Johnsen, was also signed to fill the gap left by veteran Steve Bruce's departure to Birmingham City. United also paid £3.5 million for the Czech winger Karel Poborský, who had made the headlines with a spectacular goal for the Czechs at Euro 96. United also expanded their options in the wider attacking positions by signing Jordi Cruyff, son of the Dutch legend Johan, from Barcelona. However, it was Solskjær and Johnsen who would go on to enjoy the longest and most successful careers with United, whereas Poborský lasted just 18 months before being sold to Benfica, and Cruyff was unable to hold down a regular place during his four seasons at Old Trafford.\n\nFor a while that autumn, it looked as though Newcastle had bought the title, as they ended United's unbeaten start to the league season on 20 October 1996 with a 5–0 defeat on Tyneside, triggering a three-match losing run in the league for Ferguson's men, who also suffered the club's first-ever home defeat in European competitions when they lost 1–0 at home to Fenerbahçe in the group stages of the UEFA Champions League.\n\nManchester United won their fourth league title in five seasons in 1996–97, helped by 18 goals from Solskjær. Hopes of winning the European Cup for the first time since 1968 were dashed, however, as they were defeated in the semi-finals by the eventual winners of the competition, Borussia Dortmund. At the end of the season, Eric Cantona announced his shock retirement from football just a few days before his 31st birthday. He was replaced by England international Teddy Sheringham, a £3.5 million signing from Tottenham.\n\nThe 1997–98 season saw Manchester United overhauled by Arsenal in the Premier League to finish empty-handed for only the second time in the 1990s. They had led the league for much of the season, despite the absence of new captain Roy Keane from late September due to a serious knee injury, and managed some excellent results on the way, including heavy defeats of Barnsley and Sheffield Wednesday and away victories over Liverpool and Newcastle. They entered March still 11 points ahead at the top of the league, but Arsenal took advantage of games in hand and gained the upper hand on 14 March 1998 with a 1–0 win at Old Trafford. United did manage some decent results in the run-in, but draws at home to Liverpool and Newcastle left Arsenal uncatchable.\n\nShortly after this disappointment, Ferguson broke the club's transfer record twice by signing Dutch defender Jaap Stam from PSV Eindhoven, Trinidadian striker Dwight Yorke from Aston Villa. Swedish winger Jesper Blomqvist from Parma also joined the club during the off-season. The summer of 1998 saw the departure of the club's two longest-serving players: Brian McClair ended his 11-year association with United by returning to his first club Motherwell, while Gary Pallister returned to Middlesbrough after nine years at Old Trafford.\n\nThe 1998–99 season was the most successful in the history of Manchester United. United won the Premier League, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League, becoming the first English club to achieve the feat of winning the domestic league and cup as well as the European Cup in the same season. After a 3–2 home defeat against Middlesbrough in the league on 19 December 1998, United went undefeated for the rest of the season for a run of 33 matches in all competitions.\n\nIt was during this season that United gained a reputation for not conceding defeat even in what seemed the most hopeless of circumstances, winning and drawing several matches with late goals after falling behind early on. Some of their more notable comebacks were the FA Cup Fourth Round tie at home to Liverpool, which Liverpool led from the third to the 85th minute, both legs of the UEFA Champions League semi-finals against Juventus and the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal, won by a Ryan Giggs goal deep into extra time, forced by a last-gasp Peter Schmeichel penalty save in the last of his eight seasons at the club. However, the most dramatic comeback came in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich, when Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored a goal each in stoppage time to give United a 2–1 win in stoppage time – a sixth-minute goal from Bayern's Mario Basler looked to have won the trophy for the Germans, who still had the lead with 90 minutes showing on the clock.\n\nUnited lost just five times in the entire season; three times in the league, as well as in the Charity Shield at the start of the season, and their League Cup quarter-final, in which they were defeated by eventual winners, Tottenham Hotspur. They defeated every other Premier League team at least once in all competitions and were undefeated in the Champions League.\n\nAt the expense of their presence in the 1999–2000 FA Cup, Manchester United competed in the inaugural FIFA Club World Championship, but failed to make it past the group stage. However, the team won 16 of their remaining 20 Premier League games to win the title with an 18-point margin over runners-up Arsenal, losing just three games all season. A new threat was emerging from David O'Leary's promising young Leeds United side, who finished third in the league that season and had finished fourth a year earlier, but financial problems later overtook the club and they gradually slipped out of contention for the leading honours, finally being relegated in 2004.\n\nThe following season, Manchester United won a third successive league title, Alex Ferguson becoming first manager to achieve this feat. This was once again achieved by a wide margin, and United chalked up arguably their best performance of the season in late February when they defeated Arsenal 6–1 at Old Trafford. At the end of the season, Teddy Sheringham collected both the PFA Player of the Year award and the FWA Player of the Year award, before returning to Tottenham Hotspur; he was succeeded by club record signing Ruud van Nistelrooy, a record swiftly broken by the £28.1 million signing of Argentine midfielder Juan Sebastián Verón. Van Nistelrooy would be a huge success for United, scoring 150 goals over the next five seasons, but Verón was less successful, and was sold to Chelsea two years later.\n\n2001–02 was a trophyless season; Manchester United finished third in the Premier League, and were knocked out of the Champions League by Bayer Leverkusen and the FA Cup by Middlesbrough. They did manage very impressive performances, including comprehensive victories over the likes of Ipswich Town and Tottenham Hotspur in the autumn and Derby County and Southampton before Christmas, but a run of six defeats between 16 September and 8 December left them ninth in the league with almost half of the season gone – 11 points behind leaders Liverpool, who had a game in hand and were looking better placed to win the league title than at just about any other time since their last league title in 1990. Despite a nine-match winning run sending them to the top of the table, they were in a very tight title race involving four other clubs and their title hopes were finally ended in the penultimate game of the season, where they lost 1–0 at home to an Arsenal side who clinched their second title in five seasons.\n\nThe season was also marked by the decision of Sir Alex Ferguson to make a U-turn and stay on as manager, after he had stated that he would retire at the end of the season after 16 years at the club. The 2002 close season saw the club break the national transfer record with the £29 million signing of Leeds United and England centre-half Rio Ferdinand. He helped Manchester United to another Premier League title in 2002–03, the club's eighth title in 11 seasons, after some disappointing results in the first season saw them unbeaten after the turn of the new year. The league success was one of the more remarkable because the team were 8 points behind leaders Arsenal at the beginning of March, when they also lost the League Cup final to Liverpool. Soon afterwards, David Beckham was sold to Real Madrid for £25 million, following arguments with Ferguson.\n\nBefore the start of the season, a highly rated 18-year-old Portuguese winger called Cristiano Ronaldo arrived from Sporting CP for £12.24 million. All eyes that summer, however, were on a Chelsea side who had been taken over by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and had spent more than £100 million on new players. In the 2003–04 season, Manchester United won the FA Cup for the 11th time in their history, but after Rio Ferdinand received an eight-month suspension for failing to attend a drugs test, the club finished third in the Premier League, which was won by an unbeaten Arsenal, while second place went to Chelsea. Just after the start of the 2004–05 campaign, the club signed highly regarded teenage striker Wayne Rooney from Everton for £25.6 million. In the 2004 final, United defeated Millwall 3–0. The club reached the FA Cup final again the following season, but were beaten by Arsenal in a penalty shoot-out, the first time that the FA Cup Final had been decided on penalties. Chelsea finished the season as Premier League champions, while Arsenal finished second and United third.\n\nIn May 2005, the Glazer family acquired a majority shareholding in Manchester United in a takeover valuing the club at £800 million, and a month later delisted it from the London Stock Exchange. In protest, a group of fans formed a splinter club, F.C. United of Manchester.\nThe following season's European campaign saw the club finish bottom of its group in the Champions League, failing to qualify for the UEFA Cup, the first time the club had not reached the knock-out stages of the tournament since it was created in 1992. In November, Roy Keane left the club in acrimonious fashion after criticising his fellow players so severely in an MUTV interview that chief executive David Gill ordered it not to be broadcast. The subsequent January transfer window saw the arrival of defenders Nemanja Vidić and Patrice Evra, who helped the club to its second League Cup, defeating Wigan Athletic 4–0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium. However, Manchester United finished second in the Premier League, eight points behind Chelsea, who retained their title and were now seen as the leading force in English football, although Sir Alex Ferguson was determined to prevent the West London club from winning a third successive title.\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, Manchester United suffered a shock fourth round exit from the League Cup at the hands of Southend United. The club's Champions League campaign was more successful; in the second leg of their quarter-final, the team defeated Roma 7–1 (8–3 on aggregate), the club's largest margin of victory in a European game since they beat the Irish team Waterford United 7–1 in the first round of the 1968 European Cup. However, the club lost to Milan in the semi-finals. On 22 April 2007, Cristiano Ronaldo won both PFA Players' Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year and joined Edwin van der Sar, Rio Ferdinand, Gary Neville, Nemanja Vidić, Patrice Evra, Paul Scholes, and Ryan Giggs in the PFA Team of the Year; eight members from the same team is a record. On 6 May, Manchester United won the Premier League for the ninth time in 15 years; Giggs broke Alan Hansen's record for the most league titles won, with his ninth winner's medal.\n\nThe following season, the club was knocked out of the FA Cup in a Sixth Round clash against Portsmouth, a match in which Rio Ferdinand acted as goalkeeper following injury to Van der Sar and Kuszczak being sent off. In the Champions League, Manchester United defeated Barcelona in the semi-final to set up the first all-English final. Following a 1–1 draw after extra time in Moscow, the team defeated Chelsea 6–5 on penalties, winning the club's third European Cup. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance – breaking Bobby Charlton's club record – and scored Manchester United's winning penalty. The club also won the Premier League on the final day of the season, defeating Wigan Athletic 2–0, to win the European double.\nIn December 2008, the club beat LDU Quito in the final of the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, becoming the first English team to win the competition. That season, Manchester United broke both the English and European league records for the most time played without conceding a goal and on 1 March, in the 2009 League Cup Final, the club beat Tottenham 4–1 on penalties. On 16 May, United secured their 11th Premier League title – and 18th league title overall (equalling the record held by Liverpool) – following a 0–0 draw at home to Arsenal. This was the second time the club had won three consecutive Premier League titles, but Manchester United was beaten 2–0 by Barcelona in the Champions League final in Rome on 27 May.\n\nIn the following summer transfer window, Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record £80 million and Carlos Tevez joined local rivals Manchester City, after his loan spell came to an end. On 28 February 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2–1 at Wembley Stadium to retain the League Cup, the first time the club had successfully defended a knockout cup competition. However, they were knocked out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals by Bayern Munich on away goals, and were runners-up in the Premier League, finishing one point behind Chelsea. During the summer, they signed an almost unknown Javier Hernández from Guadalajara. On 8 August 2010, Manchester United defeated Chelsea 3–1 to win the FA Community Shield. The 2010–11 campaign was a successful one, with Manchester United overhauling early leaders Chelsea and securing a record 19th league title with a 1–1 away draw against Blackburn on 14 May 2011. They faced Barcelona again in the 2011 UEFA Champions League Final, but were defeated again 3–1. However, they were beaten in the semi-finals of the FA Cup by Manchester City, who were now the wealthiest club in England and competing seriously with the English league's leading lights for the first time since the 1970s.\n\nIn the 2011–12 season, Manchester United were knocked out of the League Cup by Football League Championship side Crystal Palace in the fifth round. Just over a week later, they were knocked out of the Champions League in the group stages after a shock defeat by Basel, sending them to the UEFA Europa League for the first time. In January, Manchester United were also knocked out of the FA Cup in the fourth round by Liverpool. They lost their league title in dramatic fashion on the last day, to Manchester City. With 90 minutes showing, United's victory at Sunderland looked to have given them the title by a three-point margin as City trailed 2–1 to a QPR side managed by former United player Mark Hughes. However, two stoppage time goals saw City snatch the title on goal difference. Seven months earlier, City had crushed United 6–1 at Old Trafford in one of the club's heaviest home defeats in its history. Although, in August, United beat Arsenal 8–2 at Old Trafford, marking one of Ferguson's biggest wins against a champion of the Premier League.\n\nIn the 2012–13 season, Manchester United were knocked out of the League Cup by Chelsea in the Fifth Round. They were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League at the last 16 stage by Real Madrid 3–2 on aggregate. United were knocked out in the Sixth Round of the FA Cup by Chelsea. But overall the 2012–13 campaign was a successful one for United as they ran away with a record 20th league title, sealing it with a home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013. The key factor in United's success was top scorer Robin van Persie, a £25 million close-season signing from Arsenal. The Dutch forward was instrumental throughout the season and he fittingly scored all of United's goals as they won their title-clinching game 3–0.\n\nIn May 2013, just before the end of the Premier League season, Ferguson announced his retirement as manager of Manchester United after 27 years, with David Moyes of Everton being announced as his successor the next day. Ferguson remains as a director and ambassador for the club. On 19 May 2013, Ferguson managed Manchester United for the last time in a 5–5 draw at West Bromwich Albion, who had competed alongside them in the early stages of the title race before fading to finish eighth.\n\nDuring the Glazers' ownership, United have won 15 trophies, including five Premier League titles, three Football League Cups, five FA Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, and one FIFA Club World Cup.\n\n"}

It involves a complicated pattern of hand moves and claps at various parts of the body, following and/or imitating the percussion instruments. It resembles a highly elaborate version of pat-a-cake. Hand moves include thigh slapping, crossing the wrists, fist pounding, hand clapping, and hitch hike moves.\n\nIn 1957 when filmmaker Ken Russell was a freelance photographer, he recorded the teenagers of Soho, London hand-jiving in the basement of The Cat's Whisker coffee bar, where the hand-jive was invented by Leon Bell of Leon Bell and the Bell Cats. According to an article in the \"Daily Mirror\", \"it's so crowded the girls hand-jive to the band as there's no room for dancing.\" Russell told interviewer Leo Benedictus of \"The Guardian\" that \"the place was crowded with young kids... the atmosphere was very jolly. Wholesome... everyone jiving with their hands because there was precious little room to do it with their feet... a bizarre sight. The craze fascinated me. It seemed like a strange novelty; I used to join in.\"\n\nIn April 1958, the label London released a song called \"Hand Jive\" by Bud Allen, performed by the Betty Smith Group. The song lyrics describe the hand dance the title refers to. Hand Jive by Betty Smith released April 1958\n\nCapitol Records released the song \"Hand Jive 6-5\" in the U.S., backed with \"Ramshakle Daddy\" (3937) by British group Don Lang and the Frantic Five in March 1958 . This recording does not feature the Bo Diddley rhythm.\n\nThe hand jive was popularized in the States by Johnny Otis's \"Willie and the Hand Jive\", described as a \"funky blues rendition in a Bo Diddley styling\" and \"another approach to the growing Stateside interest in the British originated hand dance.\"\n\nThis song exhibited the Bo Diddley beat, a rhythm that originated in Latin music and was brought into mainstream American music by Bo Diddley. It has since influenced generations of musicians.\n\nJazz trumpeter Miles Davis has a track titled \"Hand Jive,\" written by drummer Tony Williams, on the album \"Nefertiti\" from 1967.\n\nEric Clapton did a version of the Johnny Otis song in 1974 that reached the Top 40.\n\nAdditionally, \"Willie and the Hand Jive\" was played on several occasions by the New Riders of the Purple Sage featuring Jerry Garcia from the Grateful Dead.\n\nGeorge Thorogood and the Delaware Destroyers recorded a version of \"Willie and the Hand Jive\" and a music video.\n\nThe hand jive is also featured prominently in the Broadway musical \"Grease\" (1971) through the song \"Born to Hand Jive\"; in the movie adaptation of the musical, the song is performed by Sha Na Na. On a DVD audio commentary for the movie, choreographer Patricia Birch mentions that the dance also went by the much more risque name \"hand job\", but the title was changed as Grease was aimed at a family audience.\n\nJazz fusion guitarist John Scofield's 1993 album is called by [Hand Jive (album)]\n\nThe long-running Walt Disney World musical Festival of the Lion King (1997) uses this during the song \"Hakuna Matata,\" and the performers and audience do it while singing the song. The audience is taught the hand jive some time before the show begins.\n\nThe 2005 album \"Midnight Boom\" by the band The Kills features the hand-jive rhythm in the song \"Sour Cherry.\" The band's goal while writing the album was to write rhythms inspired by old-school school-yard hand claps.\n\n"}

Part of the Roman Gask Ridge, it is said to be one of the most complete Roman camps in Britain, and is one of the best-preserved series of Roman military earthworks in the whole Empire. It is protected as a scheduled monument.\n\nThe remains consist of grass-covered earthworks, and are considered among the best preserved Roman earthworks in Britain. The site, which has a complex history, comprises two intersecting forts. The earliest fort is believed to be associated with the campaigns of Agricola (1st century). The later fort was apparently reconstructed within two outer ditches so that this later fort was protected by five ditches on both the east and north sides.\n\nThe field to the north is the remnant of a large annexe. Archaeology has demonstrated the existence of a watch-tower (or signal tower) and at least six overlapping marching camps to the north and northeast.\n\nArdoch was one of a chain of camps separated by one-day marches in a generally north-south direction. Other Roman camps in this chain include Strageath, Inchtuthil, Battledykes, Stracathro, Raedykes and thence taking the Elsick Mounth trackway to Normandykes.\n\nThe fort has sometimes been identified with the \"Alauna\" mentioned in Ptolemy's \"Geography\". Ptolemy placed Alauna in the area occupied by the Damnonii tribe, and the name may be associated with the River Allan which flows about one mile to the south of the fort. However the identification of Ardoch with Alauna is considered tentative.\n\nThe site was reused in the medieval period when a chapel was built near the centre of the fort. The remains of the graveyard enclosure and the site of the chapel are the only archaeological remains which are visible within the fort.\n\nIn 1726 Alexander Gordon claimed that at Ardoch Roman Fort a subterranean passage was said to run from the fort, under the River Tay to the fort or 'Keir' on Grinnin Hill. This tunnel was said to contain a great deal of treasure.\n\nArdoch was visited by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1842, although only Albert investigated the earthworks, Victoria preferred to remain in their carriage.\n\nArdoch Roman Fort is part of the Ardoch estate, and is in private ownership, although access is allowed at reasonable times. To the north, the earthwork remains of two Roman marching camps, known as Blackhill Camp, are in the care of Historic Environment Scotland.\n\n"}

{"id": "2115308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2115308", "title": "Moishe Postone", "text": "Moishe Postone\n\nMoishe Postone (17 April 1942 – 19 March 2018) was a Canadian historian, philosopher and political economist. He was Professor of History at the University of Chicago, where he was part of the Committee on Jewish Studies.\n\nMoishe Postone, son of a Canadian rabbi, received his Ph.D. from University of Frankfurt in 1983.\n\nHis research interests included modern European intellectual history; social theory, especially critical theories of modernity; 20th-century Germany; antisemitism; and contemporary global transformations. He was co-editor with Craig Calhoun and Edward LiPuma of \"Bourdieu: Critical Perspectives\" and author of \"Time, Labor and Social Domination: A Reinterpretation of Marx's Critical Theory\". He was also co-editor with Eric Santner of \"Catastrophe and Meaning: The Holocaust and the Twentieth Century\", a collection of essays that consider the meaning of the Holocaust in twentieth-century history and its influence on historical practice. Postone's work has had a large influence on the anti-Germans.\n\nHe was originally denied tenure by the University of Chicago's Sociology Department, sparking a great deal of public resentment from graduate students whom he had been involved in teaching. He was later granted tenure by the History Department.\n\nPostone was the Thomas E. Donnelley Professor of Modern History and co-director of the Chicago Center for Contemporary Theory.\n\nPostone died on 19 March 2018.\n\nIn 1978, Postone started a critical analysis on Marx's theory of value. However, his most distinguished main work, \"Time, Labor and Social Domination\", was published in 1993 (translated into French in 2009 and Japanese in 2012).\n\nIn his works he proposed a fundamental reinterpretation of Karl Marx's critique of political economy, focusing on Marx's original concepts value, capital and labour. Inspired by heterodox Marxist thinkers such as Isaak Rubin, Roman Rosdolsky, etc., and certain authors of the Frankfurt School, for example Alfred Sohn-Rethel, who remained marginal to that school, he shows that the assumptions of the 'pessimistic turn' of Horkheimer were historically rather than theoretically founded. Postone interprets critical writings on Marx's economics, especially in its Capital 1 edition, and Grundrisse, as the development of a social-mediational theory of value.\n\nPostone thought that in writing the 'Grundrisse' Marx concludes that adequate critical theory must be completely immanent to its purpose. The criticism cannot be taken from a point of view external to its object, but must appear in the mode of presentation itself. Das Kapital is so structured, for Postone, with a surface level immanent to political economics discourse and a deeper layer that grounds this discourse, which makes it particularly difficult to interpret. Indeed, precisely because of the inherent nature of the format Marx uses, the object of the critique of Marx has often been taken as the standpoint of this criticism. For example, not only is the categories of exchange value historically specific to the capitalist period, but also value's basis, the capitalist form of wage labour, must also be historically specific, and does not apply conceptually to other periods. The methodological sections of the Grundrisse clarify therefore not only Marx's presentation, but other sections make explicit that the categories of capital such as value and exchange-labour, are historically specific to the capitalist social formation. The so-called labour theory of value is not a theory of the material wealth created by labor but is in a parallel manner also seen when looked at transhistorically as \"human metabolism with nature.\" Precisely because it is not structured immanently, the 'Grundrisse' provides a key to read Capital. This is the key to the reinterpretation of the work of mature Marx, with which Postone works.\n\nStarting in this demonstration of the historically specific character of what Marx critiques, Postone then provided a new critical theory that attacks the very essence of capitalism: the form of labour specific to the capitalist social formation. Indeed, in non-capitalist societies, work is distributed by overt social relations. An individual acquires goods produced by others through the medium of undisguised social relations. Work activities derive their meaning and are determined by personal relationships, openly social and qualitatively specific (differentiated by social group, social status, the wide range of customs, traditional ties, etc.). But in a capitalist social formation, \"the objectification of labor is the means by which goods produced by others is acquired; we work to acquire other products So someone other than producer that uses the product (as well as use value) - the producer, it serves as a means for acquiring work products from other producers. It is in this sense that a product is a commodity. It is both use-value for each other and medium of exchange for the producer. This means that the work has a dual function; on one hand, it is a specific type of work that produces goods individuals to others, but on the other hand, the work, regardless of its specific content, is the producer of means to acquire the products of others. This feature of the work, which is specific to the social life in capitalism, is the basis of modern socialization, is called \"abstract labor.\" In the functioning of these new social relationships, labour under capitalism is no longer an external activity to capitalism. It is the foundation of capitalism, and so it is the labour that must be abolished.\n\nIt appears increasingly today that the new concept of \"commodity fetishism,\" which has nothing to do with a hoax of consciousness (an inverted representation), is the central part of the intellectual heritage of Marx. \"Commodity fetishism\" is not a misrepresentation, nor an exaggerated adoration, of goods. The \"fetish\" instead is to be referred to the structure of the commodity. It is then a theory of \"objective fetishism\" (Jappe) or radicalized, that is to say, so long as value (the objectification of the specific function of the spirit of labour under capitalism), the goods and money, society is actually governed by the self-movement of created things themselves, and not by the subjective manipulation of the ruling classes. The subjects are not men, but it is rather their objectified relationships that are at the heart of socialization under capitalism. Fetishism, Postone notes, must be analyzed \"in terms of the structure of social relations constituted by forms of praxis and its seizure by objectifying the category of capital (and hence value). The Subject for Marx, like Hegel is so abstract and can not be identified with any social actor whatsoever \"(Postone, Time, p. 75-76). This is the world where abstract labour (which is not immaterial labor) becomes the social bond, social mediation that mediates itself, reducing actual work to a simple expression of abstract labor. Abstract labor is then the source of alienation. The self-moving subject, Spirit, Geist, is misrecognized in Hegel, it is described by Marx as Capital and its self-valorization. It is not, Postone suggests, similar to Lukacs' use of Hegel, wherein the proletariat are identified as Spirit, for then spirit would be labour not emancipation.\n\nIt is from this concept that we can build a radical critique of the commodity, money, value, labor and politics, that is to say, a critique that is not limited to describing the struggles around management and distribution, the \"class struggle\" as traditionally understood, but recognizes that these categories themselves are problematic: they are specific only to capitalist modernity, and are responsible for its destructiveness and self-destructiveness. Pointing out that the market is a mere mechanism of distribution, and so secondary to the core of capitalism, allows Postone to broaden the historical scope of Marx's theory so that it can, with equal validity, be applied to what was the USSR. In the USSR the main difference was that instead of a market handling distribution it was planners; however, the abstract exchange of labour, which is the core of capitalism for Postone, was as it was in the West.\n\nIn his 1986 article, \"Anti-Semitism and National Socialism\", Postone developed new thinking on modern antisemitism, and particularly on National Socialist ideology. Postone saw antisemitism as a major element in the development of a socio-historical theory of consciousness determined by social forms that are subjected to socialization under capitalism. What is said about modern antisemitism may also describe a trend of vulgar anti-capitalism that seeks the personification of the elements of capitalism that are so hated. Postone showed that modern antisemitism is very different from most forms of racism and Christian antisemitism; it differs from them because it casts a huge global invisible power of international Jewry, the idea of a global conspiracy that is intrinsic to modern antisemitism.\n\nPostone analyzed antisemitism against the Marxian notion of the dual character of the commodity category. And he observed that the characteristics that antisemitism attributes to Jews are the same as for value: abstraction, invisibility, automation, impersonal domination. Postone argued that the form of socialization under capitalism (the historically specific function of the spirit of labour under capitalism) makes it possible to separate the concrete (as socially \"natural\" sound, true, etc.). This opposition between the concrete and the abstract, determined by social forms, pervades all forms of subjectivity, and thus helps to understand a central feature of the National Socialist ideology, because this ideology was not fundamentally anti-modern and it would be wrong to label it as such. It is true, Postone argued, that Nazism claimed to defend the peasantry and craftsmanship, but it also valued modern technological and industrial production. Nazism was rather a vulgar form of anti-capitalism. The rejection of the bourgeoisie and its values is present in Nazism, but Postone saw Nazi ideology as the affirmation of the concrete dimension - which includes technology and industrial production, as well as the peasantry and manual labor - as the heart of healthy social life, organic, contrasted to the abstract dimension represented by finance capital. The abstract is instead rejected - and it is personified by the Jews. Postone analyzed the figure of the Jew in modern antisemitism as the embodiment of abstract value, and extermination camps as a misbegotten notion of a \"factory\" to destroy value.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the first song performed in the show, encouraging the audience to imagine what the sparse set suggests. Its lyrics, written by Tom Jones, famously rhyme \"remember\" with \"September\", \"so tender\", \"ember\", and \"December\", and repeat the sequence -\"llow\" throughout the song: verse 1 contains \"mellow\", \"yellow\", and \"callow fellow\"; verse 2 contains \"willow\", \"pillow\", \"billow\"; verse 3 contains \"follow\", \"hollow\", \"mellow\"; and all verses end with \"follow\". They also feature an interpolated rhyme in \"wept\" and \"kept\", and alliterative lines \"when grass was green and grain was yellow\" and \"without a hurt the heart is hollow\". Harvey Schmidt composed the music.\n\n\"Try to Remember\" was originally sung by Jerry Orbach in the Original Off-Broadway production of \"The Fantasticks\".\n\n\"Try to Remember\" made the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 pop chart three times in 1965 in versions by Ed Ames, Roger Williams, Barry McGuire, The Kingston Trio, The Sandpipers, and The Brothers Four.\n\nEddie Fisher released a version in 1965 on his LP \"Eddie Fisher Today!\"\n\nThe Kim Sisters included it on their 1959 album \"The Kim Sisters: Their First Album\" through Monument Records.\n\nPatti Page did her take on the song in 1965 on her album \"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\".\n\nAndy Williams recorded it in 1966 for his album \"The Shadow of Your Smile\".\n\nJohn Davidson included it in his 1967 album, \"My Best to You\" with Columbia Records.\n\nThe Temptations rendered their version in 1967 on their album \"The Temptations in a Mellow Mood.\"\n\nPerry Como took his turn with the song in 1968 on his album \"Look to Your Heart\".\n\nRoy Orbison cut a track of it in 1969 on his album \"Roy Orbison's Many Moods\".\n\nAlso in 1969, the song was recorded by Jamaican reggae singer Pat Kelly.

It is the southernmost point of the island and is the northern point of the western entrance of the Menai Strait.\n\nThe headland is mainly composed of sand dunes at the end of Newborough Warren and therefore has no road leading up to or onto it. The nearest major public road, along which a public bus runs is the A4080 at Newborough. Due to its exposed location and the nature of the straits the Ordnance Survey map for the point carries a warning \"\"Public Rights of Way to Abermenai Point can be dangerous under tidal conditions.\"\"\n\nThe earliest recorded ferry crossing route from the island to the mainland ran from the point to the site at which Fort Belan now sits. Records in the late 11th century relating to the then King of Gwynedd, Gruffudd ap Cynan state that a ferryman was employed there and ferry houses at both locations have been recorded throughout history. In 1725, Daniel Defoe, the author of novels such as \"\"Robinson Crusoe\"\" used the crossing on his way to Holyhead. The ferry ceased to run in the mid-19th century and by the 1940s almost all trace of it had disappeared. The decline of the ferry service was almost certainly due to the construction between 1846 and 1850 of the Britannia Bridge further east up the Strait which brought the railway to the island.\n\n"}

He allegedly spied for the Soviet Naval GRU during World War II. Soviet naval intelligence was much smaller than the Soviet army's GRU, and only a fraction of the size of the KGB.\n\nFahy was born in Washington D.C. in 1908 and grew up in New York City. His father was a senior partner at Walter J. Fahy and Co, a stock exchange firm. Fahy worked for Senator George H. Moses in the late 1920s. After the Stock Market Crash of 1929, Fahy became a Socialist.\n\nFahy studied at New York University, the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, San Marcus University in Peru, Black Mountain College in North Carolina, and Montana State University where he took courses in animal husbandry. Fahy established several small businesses during this time.\n\nFahy served in the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War on behalf of the Socialist Party.\n\nWhen Fahy returned to the U.S. after being wounded in the war in 1938, he publicly argued with Socialist Party leader Norman Thomas on policy differences over the Spanish Civil War, and resigned from the Party in an open letter published in the Communist \"Daily Worker\". Afterward Fahy became Vice President of the \"Hemisphere News Service\" under Robert Miller, and they later hired Joseph Gregg to manage it. Gregg and Fahy had served together in Spain. The news service was absorbed into the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (CIAA) in 1941, an agency that coordinated diplomacy, propaganda and economic warfare in Latin America.\n\nFahy left the CIAA and joined the Board of Economic Warfare and held the position of Principal Intelligence Officer. In 1943 Fahy was about to become chairman of the Territorial Affairs Bureau in the Department of the Interior, Rep. Martin Dies, Jr. placed Fahy on a list of government employees suspected as being Communists. The Kerr Commission upon hearing Fahy's testimony agreed his involvement with the Socialist party was a \"youthful misadventure\" and concluded Fahy had been \"loyal\" and \"has not been guilty of any subversive activity\".\n\nFahy's alleged code name with the Soviet Naval GRU, \"MAXWELL,\" was deciphered in the Venona project, although the value of these decryptions in identifying Soviet agents remains controversial. Venona transcripts allege that Fahy was transmitting information to the Soviet Naval GRU for money. The information Fahy transmitted was regarded in Moscow as very valuable. Moscow sent a message to the Washington Naval GRU to \"communicate each item of information from Fahy on political questions to the Master [Soviet ambassador] and telegraph it to me with the post-script 'report to the Master'.\"\n\n"}

When she was old enough, she travelled to Paris, where she met and married the intellectual Stanislas Pieczynski. In 1875 she followed him to Poland. Horrified by the lack of education of women there, she began at once to teach reading and writing. In 1881 she turned back to help people in Switzerland.

In 1889 she traveled to the United States, where she became familiar with the organized women's right movement. In 1891 she went back to Switzerland and studied further. In Bern she met Helene von Mülinen, who would become her life partner. She took part in the first Swiss Congress for the Interests of Women in Geneva.

Species used are typically those that are common and breed rapidly, making them easy to catch and in regular supply. Examples of marine bait fish are anchovies, gudgeon, halfbeaks such as ballyhoo, and scad. Some larger fish such as menhaden, flying fish, or ladyfish may be considered bait fish in some circles, depending on the size of the gamefish being pursued.\nFreshwater bait fish include any fish of the minnow or carp family (Cyprinidae), sucker family (Catostomidae), top minnows or killifish family (Cyprinodontidae), shad family (Clupeidae), sculpin of the order Osteichthyes and sunfish family (Centrarchidae), excluding black basses and crappies.\n\nBait fish can be contrasted with forage fish. \"Bait fish\" is a term used particularly by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch fish to bait longlines and traps. \"Forage fish\" is a fisheries term, and is used in that context. Forage fish are small fish that are preyed on in the wild by larger predators for food. The predators can be other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Bait fish, by contrast, are fish that are caught by humans to use as bait for other fish. The terms also overlap in the sense that most bait fish are also forage fish, and most forage fish can also be used as bait fish.\n\nBaitfish can be attracted either via scent, or by using light which actually works by attracting zooplankton, a primary food source for many baitfish, which are then drawn to the light.\n\nBait fish can also be contrasted with feeder fish. \"Feeder fish\" is a term used particularly in the context of fish aquariums. It refers essentially the same concept, small fish that are eaten by larger fish, but adapted for use in a different context.\n\nBait fish are consumed by larger, aquatic predators. Swimming in ocean water with bait fish can be dangerous, as these fish attract sharks. Bait fish will sometimes use whale sharks as a shield from their other predators such as tuna, as tuna are usually wary of approaching the sharks. The shark cannot attack the bait fish easily, as they constantly swim above them and are too fast for the shark to manoeuvre its mouth into position. However, the sharks eventually dive deep, where the bait fish cannot follow, and as the other predators finally dare attack the stranded bait fish, the shark comes back to eat numerous bait fish who are already preoccupied with the attacking tuna.\n\nThere is a bait fish industry in North America, supplying mainly recreational fishermen, worth up to one billion dollars each year.\n\nBait fish are often short-lived and proliferate spawners. This means their populations can fluctuate rapidly, and they can often recover quickly when depleted. Regulations may exist to prevent overexploitation, as in Arkansas and Massachusetts. Studies by fisheries and conservation agencies monitor the health of bait fish populations, allowing regional governments to set quotas.\n\n"}

At the 2010 census it was home to 6,278,614 people, of whom 1,858,875 lived in the built-up (or 'metro') area made of three urban districts. It is the second most populated city of Sichuan Province, after Chengdu. The administrative center is Shunqing District.\n\nNanchong was in the territory of the state of Ba before it was conquered by the Qin in 314 BC. The Qin set up a government at Langzhong City. Anhan City was established in Shunqinq district at the beginning of the Han Dynasty.\n\nIn 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu of Han instituted the Anhan () County in this place. Anhan literally means \"to establish or stabilize Han\". In 8 AD, the name was changed to Anxin () when Wang Mang seized the throne of the Han Dynasty, but it reverted to Anhan in 25 AD. It was again changed to Guozhou () in 621 AD (Tang dynasty), and then to Nanchong in 742 AD. The nickname of Nanchong is Guocheng (), derived from Guozhou.\n\nNanchong is in the northeast of Sichuan Province. To the east of Nanchong is Dazhou, to the west are Mianyang and Suining, and to the north is Guangyuan.\n\nThe vast majority of this area is hilly. The woodland coverage is 25%.\n\nThe Jialing River, a tributary of the Yangtze River, crosses the prefecture from north to south. There are another 30 rivers in the prefecture with a drainage basin of more than .\n\nAs with the rest of the Sichuan Basin, Nanchong has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen \"Cwa\") with high humidity year-round; winters are short and mild while summers long, hot, and humid. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July; the annual mean is . Frost is uncommon and the frost-free period lasts 290−320 days.\n\nOver 70% of the of annual precipitation occurs from May to September. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from around 9% in December to 47% in August, the city receives only 1,135 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March–April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October–November).\n\nThe Han people are the largest ethnic group in this area, contributing to 99.88% of its population; another 48 ethnic groups can be found in the city. Langzhong has a large Hui Muslim community.\n\nAs in other cities of China, the population of Nanchong can be divided into two parts: upper urban population and lower rural population. The registered urban population is about 1.2 million.\n\nShunqing District, downtown, is the most dense area in Nanchong. At the center of Shunqing District, and the proverbial heart of the city, is Five Star Garden (); a large roundabout with five exits leading to other sections of the city.\n\nAgriculture is the pillar of Nanchong’s economy, with 80% of Nanchong’s population in rural areas and committed to traditional agricultural activities. Nanchong’s manufacturing industry also relies on raw materials which are provided by agriculture.\n\nNanchong’s main agricultural product is food. A large quantity of rice, orange, silk worms, and pork are produced to support related manufacturers.\n\nNanchong’s main manufacturing outputs are petroleum products, automobiles and parts, mechanical equipment, textiles, and building materials.\nThere is a large quantity of rock oil and natural gas found in Nanchong, and it has the largest slate mine in the west of China. The dams on Jialing River and its branches have a large potential to increase electric power generation. But the largest resource of Nanchong is human: Nanchong is one of the main providers of Chinese cheap migrant workers.\n\nTransportation in Nanchong is quite convenient compared with other cities in Sichuan province because of its extensive express railway network, shipping, and air service.\n\nNanchong is a transport hub of the northeast Sichuan Province. It is crossed by the strategic China National Highway 318, built by the Chinese government in the 1930s, and China National Highway 212 and newly built expressways — Cheng-Nan and Nan-Guang expressway — which link the city to Chengdu and another prefecture-level city: Guang'an. The expressway to Chongqing is under construction.\n\nThe Dazhou–Chengdu Railway through Nanchong links Chengdu and Dazhou. The Chongqing–Lanzhou Railway, in 2015, will link Lanzhou (Gansu) and Chongqing, and turn Nanchong into a railway hub in northeast Sichuan province. The Nanchong railway station provides passenger and cargo services to regional and national economic centres such as Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Wuhan, Chengdu and Shenzhen.\n\nThe old Nanchong airport was built in the 1950s and closed in 2003.

Becker\n\nWilliam Dee Becker (October 23, 1876, in East St. Louis, Illinois – August 1, 1943, in St. Louis, Missouri) was the 35th Mayor of St. Louis, from 1941 to 1943.\n\nBecker, the son of German immigrants, graduated from Harvard University and St. Louis Law School. After 15 years of private law practice, he was elected to a twelve-year term on the St. Louis Court of Appeals in 1916. He was re-elected for second 12-year term in 1928. In 1941 Becker was the Republican Party nominee for Mayor of St. Louis. He defeated incumbent Mayor Bernard F. Dickmann (a Democrat) who was seeking election to a third term in the April 1941 election.\n\nPerhaps the most significant development during Becker's term as mayor was the adoption of a civil service amendment to the City Charter. The amendment enacted a merit system for the hiring of city employees. Prior to that time, a political patronage system prevailed in which all city employees could be replaced with a change of partisan administration. Becker supported the civil service reform and it was approved by the voters in September 1941. Becker also retained Raymond Tucker who had been appointed Smoke Commissioner by Mayor Dickmann and supported his efforts to reduce air pollution within the city. \n\nOn the Sunday afternoon of August 1, 1943, St. Louis aircraft manufacturer William B. Robertson was hosting the first public demonstration of a new Waco CG-4 glider, built under sub-contract by his company. As a crowd of spectators watched at the Lambert St. Louis Airport, Mayor Becker, Robertson, and other St. Louis luminaries boarded the glider that was towed along by a transport plane for a flight over the city. Immediately after the release of the towing cable, the right-wing of the glider broke off, and it plummeted from an altitude of 1,500 feet, killing all ten persons on board. Becker was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery. Aloys P. Kaufmann, president of the city's Board of Aldermen, succeeded Becker as Mayor of St. Louis.\n\n"}

Doyne Farmer (born 22 June 1952) is an American complex systems scientist and entrepreneur with interests in chaos theory, complexity and econophysics. He is a Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University, where he is Director of the Complexity Economics at the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, and is also an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute. His current research is on complexity economics, focusing on systemic risk in financial markets and technological progress. During his career he has made important contributions to complex systems, chaos, artificial life, theoretical biology, time series forecasting and econophysics. He co-founded Prediction Company, one of the first companies to do fully automated quantitative trading. While a graduate student he led a group that called itself Eudaemonic Enterprises and built the first wearable digital computer, which was used to beat the game of roulette.\n\nThough born in Houston, Texas, Farmer grew up in Silver City, New Mexico. He was strongly influenced by Tom Ingerson, a young physicist and Boy Scout leader who inspired his interest in science and adventure. Scout activities included searching for an abandoned Spanish goldmine to fund a mission to Mars, a road trip to the Northwest Territories and backcountry camping in the Barranca del Cobre. Farmer graduated from Stanford University in 1973 with a BS in Physics and went to graduate school at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he studied physical cosmology under George Blumenthal.\n\nWhile still in graduate school, Farmer and his childhood friend Norman Packard formed a group called Eudaemonic Enterprises. Their goal was to beat the game of roulette and use the proceeds to form a science commune. The word eudaemonia comes from Aristotle and refers to a state of enlightenment derived from a life lived in accordance with reason.\nThey bought a roulette wheel and did an extensive experimental and theoretical study of its physics. To execute their system, they built the first wearable digital computer, at roughly the same time as the first Apple desktop computer. Farmer hand-coded the three-kilobyte program for the computer in machine language. The program included a floating-point package, a sequencer to perform the calculation, and an operating system that functioned with toe inputs and vibrating outputs. The earliest version of the computer was hidden under the armpits, but a later version was concealed in a shoe.\n\nTheir scheme took advantage of the fact that typically more than ten seconds elapse from the time the croupier releases the ball until bets are closed. During this time one person measured the position and velocity of the ball and rotor using his big toe to click a switch in his shoe. The computer used this information to predict the likely landing position of the ball. A signal was relayed to a second person, who quickly placed the bets. They made over eleven trips to Las Vegas, Reno and Tahoe, and achieved a 20% advantage over the house, but suffered persistent hardware problems. This combined with their fear of violence at the hands of the casinos, so that they never played for high stakes and failed to realize the large sums they originally dreamed of.\n\nAfter the roulette project Farmer switched his dissertation topic to chaotic dynamics and joined together with James P. Crutchfield, Norman Packard, and Robert Shaw to found the Dynamical Systems Collective (subsequently known by others as the Chaos Cabal). Although they had the blessing of faculty members William L. Burke and Ralph Abraham, they essentially co-advised each other's PhD theses. Their most important contribution was a method for state space reconstruction, that made it possible to visualize and study chaotic attractors based only on a single time series. This has now been used to identify chaotic attractors and study their properties in a wide variety of physical systems. In his PhD thesis in 1981 Farmer showed how varying a parameter of an infinite dimensional system could give rise to a sequence of successively more complicated chaotic attractors, resembling the transition to turbulence. He later developed a method for nonlinear time series forecasting that has been used for exploiting low dimensional chaos to make better short term forecasts. Other work included an improved method for state space reconstruction, and a derivation of the fundamental limits in which this becomes impossible, so that the dynamics become inherently random. He and colleagues also developed a method for determining when chaos can be distinguished from the null hypothesis of a correlated linear random process.\n\nAfter finishing his doctorate in 1981, Farmer took a post-doctoral appointment at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory and received an Oppenheimer Fellowship in 1983. He developed an interest in what is now called complex systems and co-organized several seminal conferences in this area. In 1988 he founded the Complex Systems Group in the Theoretical Division and recruited a group of postdoctoral fellows who subsequently became leaders in the field, including Kunihiko Kaneko, Chris Langton, Walter Fontana, Steen Rasmussen, David Wolpert, James Theiler and Seth Lloyd.\n\nFarmer and Norman Packard developed the concept of \"metadynamics\", i.e. co-evolving networks and dynamical systems. For example, the nodes of the network might represent chemical species and the edges their possible reactions, whose kinetics give rise to a system of differential equations. As new species are produced the set of reactions changes and the kinetics are in turn altered. This concept was used to model the immune system and the origin of life. Joint work with Richard Bagley produced a simulation of an autocatalytic set of polymers in which a few species are maintained at high concentration, with many of the properties of a metabolism; the autocatalytic set evolved through time in a manner resembling the evolution of living systems, but without a genetic code.\n\nJames Keeler and Farmer demonstrated that a system of coupled logistic maps could produce fluctuations with a 1/f power spectrum. They showed that this occurred because the system continually tunes itself to stay near a critical point, a property that was later dubbed self-organized criticality by Per Bak.\n\nIn 1991 Farmer gave up his position at Los Alamos, reunited with Norman Packard and graduate school classmate James McGill, and co-founded the Prediction Company. The prevailing view at the time was that markets were perfectly efficient, so that it was not possible to make consistent profits without inside information. Farmer and Packard were motivated by their desire to prove this wrong. The trading strategy that was developed was an early version of statistical arbitrage, and made use of a variety of signals that derived from processing essentially all quantitative inputs related to the US stock market. It also included a high-frequency forecasting model as an overlay that reduced transaction costs. From 1996 onward, trading was completely automated. Farmer was one of the chief architects of the trading system as it existed in 1999. Prediction Company was sold to UBS in 2006 and in 2013 was re-sold to Millenium Management, where it is their second largest fund.\n\nFarmer left Prediction Company in 1999 for the Santa Fe Institute, where he did interdisciplinary research at the interface of economics and complex systems, developed a theory of market ecology and was one of the founders of econophysics.\n\nMarket ecology is based on the observation that financial firms engage in specialized strategies and can be sorted into groups, analogous to species in biology. Market impact limits the size of any particular strategy. Farmer showed how to a construct a market food web, that describes the way in which trading strategies influence each other's profits and size. The market food web is supported by fundamental economic activities, such as demand for liquidity, lending to the real economy and risk diversification. These create patterns in prices that are exploited by trading firms, who are analogous to predators in biology. Some strategies are stabilizing while others are destabilizing, and shifts in the market ecology can give rise to financial instabilities, e.g. booms and busts. These ideas had an important influence on the adaptive markets hypothesis.\n\nFarmer is considered one of the founders of the field of \"econophysics\". This is distinguished from economics by a more data-driven approach to building fundamental models, breaking away from the standard theoretical template used in economics of utility maximization and equilibrium. Together with Michael Dempster of Cambridge, Farmer started a new journal called \"Quantitative Finance\" and served as the co-editor-in-chief for several years.\n\nHis contributions to market microstructure include the identification of several striking empirical regularities in financial markets, such as the extraordinary persistence of order flow. Fabrizio Lillo and Farmer observed that there are long periods where the orders flowing into the market are much more likely to be to buy than to sell, and vice versa, with correlations decaying very slowly as a power law. He and his collaborators developed a zero intelligence model for the continuous double auction that was shown to predict the spread between bid and ask prices. A variety of different empirical studies documented the law of market impact, which states that the average change in price due to an order entering the market is proportional to the square root of the order size. This law is remarkable as it is universal, in the sense that the functional form of market impact remains the same as long as markets are operating under \"normal\" conditions. The work of him and his colleagues set the foundation that was eventually developed by the group of Jean-Philippe Bouchaud.\n\nThe crisis of 2008 is widely believed to have been an example of a leverage cycle, in which lending first becomes too loose and then becomes too tight. An agent-based model for leveraged value investors shows how the use of leverage can explain the fat tails and clustered volatility observed in financial markets. Similarly, the use of Value at Risk, as embodied in Basel II, can lead to a cycle in which leverage and prices slowly rise while volatility falls, followed by a crash in which prices and leverage plummet while volatility spikes upward, resembling the Great Moderation and subsequent crisis.\n\nAlthough innovation might seem by its very nature to be unpredictable, in fact there are several empirical regularities that suggest the opposite. Together with several colleagues Farmer developed a theory for explaining Wright's law, which states that costs drop as a power law function of cumulative production. By gathering data on many different technologies, this can be shown to be closely related to Moore's law, which can be used to make reliable forecasts for technological progress under business as usual scenarios. He is currently trying to develop an ecology framework for growth economics. Recently, in a paper with J. McNerney, J. Savoie and F. Caravelli, this idea has been put forward in \"How production networks amplify economic growth\", in which a predictive model of economic growth based on ecology ideas was developed.\n\nFarmer has written about science and adventure and is an avid sailor and backpacker. Doyne is listed as member of BMLL Technologies Ltd, a Cambridge University spin-off working in the field of limit order book data and analytics. He continues his entrepreneurial activities as Executive Chairman of Scientific Investments.\n\nFarmer and Packard's work on roulette, along with their adventures in the casinos of Nevada, has been featured in the 2004 Breaking Vegas documentary series, \"Beat the Wheel\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is encountered in two different forms, the yellow orthorhombic mineral tellurite, β-TeO, and the synthetic, colourless tetragonal (paratellurite), α-TeO. Most of the information regarding reaction chemistry has been obtained in studies involving paratellurite, α-TeO.\n\nParatellurite, α-TeO, is produced by reacting tellurium with O:\n\nAn alternative preparation is to dehydrate tellurous acid, HTeO, or to thermally decompose basic tellurium nitrate,TeO.HNO above 400 °C.\n\nThe longitudinal speed of sound in Tellurium dioxide is at around room temperature.\n\nTeO is barely soluble in water and soluble in strong acids and alkali metal hydroxides. It is an amphoteric substance and therefore can act both as an acid or as a base depending on the solution it is in. It reacts with acids to make tellurium salts and bases to make tellurites. It can be oxidized to telluric acid or tellurates.\n\nParatellurite, α-TeO, converts at high pressure into the β-, tellurite form. Both the α-, (paratellurite) and β- (tellurite forms) contain four coordinate Te with the oxygen atoms at four of the corners of a trigonal bipyramid. In paratellurite all vertices are shared to give a rutile-like structure, where the O-Te-O bond angle are 140°. α-TeO In tellurite pairs of trigonal pyramidal, TeO units, sharing an edge, share vertices to then form a layer. The shortest Te-Te distance in tellurite is 317 pm, compared to 374 pm in paratellurite. Similar TeO units are found in the mineral denningite.\n\nIt is used as an acousto-optic material.\n\nTellurium dioxide is also a reluctant glass former, it will form a glass under suitable cooling conditions, or with small molar% additions of a second compound such as an oxide or halide. TeO glasses have high refractive indices and transmit into the mid-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum, therefore they are of technological interest for optical waveguides.

It is organized in 12 Faculties.\n\nThe University of Palermo was officially founded in 1806, although its earliest roots date back to 1498 when medicine and law were taught there. A little later in history, from the second half of the 16th century from their seat at the Collegio Massimo al Cassero, the Jesuit Fathers granted degrees in Theology and Philosophy - subjects in which they had been masters for over 200 years.\n\nIn 1767 they were expelled from the kingdom by King Ferdinand I, until 37 years later, when they returned to take their seat - which in the meantime had been turned into the Regia Accademia.\n\nAt this time, the same King Ferdinand decided to grant a good seat to the Accademia, moving its location to the Convent of the Teatini Fathers next to the Church of St. Giuseppe.\n\nAfter the unification of Italy in 1860, the University of Palermo was modernized under the impetus of the chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro and the minister and specialist in Arab studies Michele Amari, more or less assuming its present appearance. Since 1984 the main building of the University, housing the Rector's office, is Palazzo Chiaramonte-Steri, one of the most important historical buildings in Palermo, built in 1307 and formerly the residence of the Chiaramonte. Not far from Palazzo Steri, on land formerly belonging to the Chiaramonte, the Botanical Gardens of Palermo constitute a further admirable pearl of the University.\n\nToday, the University has grown to be an institution of about 2000 lecturers and 50,000 students in which research in all main fields of study is carried out. In the past few years the university has actively taken part in international cooperation programmes.\n\nThese are the 12 faculties in which the university is divided into:\n\n\nAmong the best-known people who have attended the University of Palermo are Italian political leaders Renato Schifani and Angelino Alfano; chemists Stanislao Cannizzaro and Emanuele Paternò; jurist Filippo Mancuso and the President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, who was also professor in the same university.\n\n\n"}

Its capital is the town of Svitavy. As a part of Pardubice Region the district has borders with Ústí nad Orlicí District to the north and Chrudim District to the west. The district was administratively formed in 1960, when the former districts of Litomyšl, Moravská Třebová, Polička and Svitavy were merged.\n\nSvitavy District incorporates parts of historical regions of Bohemia and Moravia. From a total of 116 municipalities, 44 municipalities (including the district's capital) are situated in Moravia. As of 1 January 2007, 48,864 inhabitants live in the Moravian part of the district. The Bohemian part counted 67 municipalities with 50,885 inhabitants. Five municipalities (Brněnec, Březová nad Svitavou, Kamenná Horka, Karle and Radiměř altogether having 4,769 inhabitants) lie in Bohemia as well as Moravia.\n\nWith a total area of 1,379 km² it is the largest district of the Pardubice Region. From the total area of the district, agricultural land occupies 835.1 km² (arable land 628,8 km², permanent pastures 171.3 km² and water bodies 10.8 km²). Forests cover 31.3% of the district's area.\n\nThe district is divided into drainage basins of the Elbe and the Danube. The main rivers in the district are Svitava (central part of the district), Svratka (south-eastern part), Třebůvka (eastern part), Třebovka and Loučná (both in the north-western part). The former three rivers comprise part of the Danube basin, while the latter two comprise part of the Elbe basin. The largest water body in Svitavy District is the pond Hvězda, with an area of 82 ha.\n\nAs of 31 December 2012, the district had 104,971 inhabitants from which 53,120 were women and 51,851 were men. The average age was 40.9 years; 15.3% of the inhabitants were 14 years or younger, while 16.5% were 65 years or older. The district's workforce counted 53,955 people.\n\nThe district has a continental climate which is characterised by significant variations in temperature in the course of the year. There are slight variations between the climate in various parts of the district. The northwestern and southeastern part of the district have an average temperature of 7 °C and precipitation up to 600 mm in one year. The central part of the district is slightly cooler and more humid, with an average temperature of 6 °C and precipitation of 700 mm. The southeastern part of the district is even cooler and even more humid.\n\nThe district has been suffering from the highest unemployment rate in the Pardubice region, reaching 8.6% at the end of 2012.\n\nThe economy of the district is oriented towards agriculture and manufacturing. The share of the district's employment accounted for by agriculture has been steadily decreasing, yet it is still higher than in other districts of the Pardubice Region. The agricultural sector mainly produces cereals and rapeseed.\n\nThere is a relatively varied structure of manufacturing in the Svitavy district. Food and textile production comprise the main volume of manufacturing. However, the long-term importance of textile manufacturing is decreasing. Glass fibre production, metalworking and mechanical engineering are other important branches of manufacturing in the district.\n\n\n"}

The lochans have become known as the 'Fairy Lochs' due to their proximity to 'Sìthean Mòr' which translates as 'Big Fairy Hill'.\n\nThe lochans are close to Loch Bràigh Horrisdale, which flows into the Badachro River (Scots Gaelic: \"Abhainn Bad a' Chrodha\"). There are several large waterfalls in the area, and Sìthean Mor overlooks the Lochan Sgeireach and the bay of Loch Gairloch.\n\nThe lochs are remote and are accessed over farmland and along paths through marshy ground.\n\nAlthough small and remote, the Fairy Lochs are notable as the crash site of an American World War II bomber. On 13 June 1945, a USAAF B-24 Liberator bomber (serial 42-95095, based at the Warton Aerodrome) was returning to the USA from Prestwick Airfield at the end of World War II.\n\nOn board were a crew of nine from 66th Bomber Squadron and six passengers from Air Transport Command.\n\nThe aircraft's planned route to Keflavík (Meeks Field) in Iceland should have taken it over Stornoway in the Western Isles, however, for reasons unknown, the aircraft flew instead over the Scottish mainland. Over Wester Ross the aircraft began to lose height and struck the summit of Slioch (), losing parts of its bomb bay doors, before flying on towards Gairloch. An attempted crash-landing resulted in the aircraft colliding with rocks and crashing into the Fairy Lochs, scattering wreckage over a wide area. All 15 crew and passengers on board perished in the accident.\nToday much of the wreckage remains where the plane crashed. Pieces of fuselage lie in the bogs and a propeller and an engine can be seen protruding from the lochan. The area is classed as a war grave and visitors are expected not to disturb the wreckage. A memorial plaque, listing those who died, was erected by the families and friends of those killed.\n\nThe loss of the USAAF 42-95095 was not unique in this region, as other accidents involving military aircraft have taken place nearby. In 1951, an Avro Lancaster crashed on Beinn Eighe, a mountain near Slioch on the opposite shore of Loch Maree.\n\n"}

The appearance was stylised by Belgian designer Philippe Neerman.\n\nTenders for manufacture of the tram led to contracts with ABB Group and \"SOCIMI\" (Milan, Italy); SOCIMI subsequently became bankrupt and ABB completed production alone, on the basis of SOCIMI's prototypes; the trams were manufactured at ABB's Holgate works, York and Litchurch lane works, Derby in the UK, with some parts from ABB Trazione (Italy).\n\nThe tram design was modular, consisting cabs, passenger units, and articulation sections. The initial Strasbourg vehicles used seven modules: two cabs, three passenger units and two articulation sections, for a train length of Each train has a mixture of powered and unpowered bogies; the bogie design used independently rotating wheels, each on a stub axle, the primary suspension was of the radial arm type, and the secondary suspension air spring type. Each wheel of a powered bogie was separately powered by bogie mounted three phase asynchronous motors, connected via a gearbox, with the wheel and motor axises of rotation parallel.\n\nThe maximum capacity of the Strasbourg seven module trams was 285 with 66 seated, the nine-module trams had an increased capacity of 370 passengers, with 92 seated. Total installed traction power was } for the seven and nine module trams.\n\nAfter the acquisition of Adtranz (ABB transportation group's successor) by Bombardier the design was marketed as part of the Flexity Outlook family.\n\nThe Eurotram design was planned to be used on the Nottingham tram system which was under development in 1998. However safety regulations relating to door closing, coupled with the relatively slow motion of the Eurotram's single leaf door meant that the tram would be delayed at stops; an alternative design was chosen, the double leaf doored Incentro tram.\n\nIn December 2002 Porto tram number 018 was taken to Australia, five sections being placed on static display outside Customs House, Sydney for two weeks before being taken to Melbourne where it operated on the local tram network until March 2003 as a seven section tram.\n\nTwenty-six 33.1m (7 module) Eurotrams were delivered to (Strasbourg tramway) CTS for service on Strasbourg's line A between 1994 and 1995. CTS placed a second order in 1996 for twenty-seven units, nine of which were 7 module trains, and eighteen were 9 module trains.\n\nThe Milan tram system (\"Azienda Trasporti Milanesi\") acquired 20 units from Adtranz.\n\n72 units were built for the Porto tram network (Porto Metro) were constructed from 2004 at Bombardier's factory in Amadora Portugal.

The song became another worldwide hit for the group, and was included on the \"Sliding Doors\" soundtrack. It featured on the soundtrack for the 1998 film \"Sliding Doors\", and was released across the world the same year. In Japan, \"Turn Back Time\" was released along with \"My Oh My\". The song subsequently gained far more radio airplay than their other releases. It possesses less of a bubble pop sound than Aqua's other releases; it is slow-paced and shows the full range of Lene Nystrøm Rasted's vocals but maintains the Aqua sound. The song samples the Pet Shop Boys' 1988 single \"Heart\".\n\nLarry Flick from \"Billboard\" wrote that \"here's what will likely be the third successful single from the Euro-dance act's massive album, \"Aquarium\". It is, by far, the most credible pop offering from the set, with its shuffling faux-funk beat and sax lines. Everything about this track is surprisingly reserved-including the lead vocals, which are dramatically toned down from a kewpie-doll squeak to a quasi-soulful belt.\" CantStopThePop declared it to be \"their finest song by a country mile – and one of the best pop ballads of the ‘90s to boot.\" They also added it as \"one of the biggest surprises of the ‘90s.\" Alex Young from \"Consequence of Sound\" said that \"the slower paced song allows Lene's vocal range to shine.\" \"Dayton Daily News\" noted the \"mellow, trip-hoppy beats\" of the song. Tom Ewing from Freaky Trigger described it as a \"cryptic, self-hating ballad about choices and dire consequences.\" He noted that Nystrøm \"has a strong, torchy voice\" and \"can set a mood.\" He also added that \"in half a verse she's established a lonely, withdrawn, guilty feeling she might push against in the rest of the song.\" \n\nSarah Davis from \"Dotmusic\" said that Nystrøm's tones on the song \"bear an uncanny resemblance to the Material Girl by Madonna. She added that the ballad is \"relying less on Euro-pop clich?s than their previous two singles, it shows that Aqua can write songs which move beyond the cartoon world of their stylists.\" Dave Sholin from the \"Gavin Report\" commented that it was \"time to take it downtempo, and this standout track from Aquarium contains all the elements necessary to quickly float to the top. More than a handful of PDs and MDs consider this ballad to have Number One potential. This is an impressive display of the Danish group's versatility.\" Bob Waliszewski of \"Plugged In\" noted that it deal with \"regrets over unfaithfulness with a desire for reconciliation\". Pop Rescue said \"Turn Back Time\" is the best song of their career, adding that \"here, Lene shows off her vocal range beautifully, and it's great to hear her pitched against the soft beats, piano, and gentle synths without some randomly thrown in 'eye-pee-eye-ohs. Perfect.\" Dave Fawbert from \"ShortList\" described it as \"one of the all-time great lost pop classics. No ifs, no buts, no irony, just a glorious, timeless piece of songwriting.\"\n\nThe single is their third number-one single in the United Kingdom. On its May 1998 UK release, the song topped the charts for one week. This single reached #18 on \"Billboard\"'s Top 40 Mainstream chart and therefore was their second highest charting hit in the United States.\n\nThe video for the release contained footage from \"Sliding Doors\", and was therefore a departure from the campy and humorous style by the group. There are two different edits of this video, one contains more clips from the film. In the video, the doppelgänger of the lead singer Lene Nystrøm is chasing her in the London Underground.

Grimm has released five solo albums, five collaborative albums and two compilation albums.\n\nPercy Carey grew up in the Upper West Side section of Manhattan. His neighbor, Morgan Freeman, helped arrange for him to be cast as a child actor on Sesame Street, he first appeared in Season 7, Episode 0806. He appeared on the show from Age 5 to around Age 9. \"One episode, I lost my tooth, and me and Big Bird had to go through Sesame Street and try to find it,\" Carey remembers. The idea for that episode came about after Carey told Jim Henson about a dream he'd had the night before.\n\nDuring his teenage years Grimm became involved with the hip hop community and decided that he wanted to be an MC at the age of 14. His mother supported this dream and bought him turntables and a microphone. Carey was expelled from Park West High School in Hell's Kitchen after beating up the school's Dean over owed drug money.\n\nMF Grimm's career began in the late 1980s where he performed in New York City. He later went on tour with MC Lyte as well. Into the 1990s Grimm continued to perform at freestyle competitions and performed alongside rappers Lord Finesse, GZA and Large Professor, amongst others. MF Grimm's most recent releases include a three-part conceptual series of albums with producer Drasar Monumental titled \"Good Morning Vietnam\".\n\nIn the early nineties Carey moved to California where he formed a DJ/rapper group called the Gravediggaz (not to be confused with the Gravediggaz) and through the mid-nineties worked together with Roc Raida as his DJ. In 1993, Grimm placed third at the World Supremacy Battle, already known as an experienced battle rapper. That year, he released his first 12\" single, \"So Whatcha Want Nigga?\" (later released on the \"Scars & Memories\" album in 2005) and performed at the Jack The Rapper convention on Execution Night, sharing the stage with Lady of Rage, Tupac, and Tha Dogg Pound, in Atlanta. He also collaborated with hip-hop legends like Kool G Rap, Kurious and KMD, appearing on albums and singles by them.\n\nIn 1993, MF Grimm had recorded an album's worth of material that was to serve as his debut album. After being shot and hospitalized, a lot of the material was stolen or lost, as it wasn't expected that he would survive his coma. After he woke up from the coma Grimm was able to retrieve some of the lost records and some of this material went on to be released later as singles, and later formed the 2005 compilation album \"Scars & Memories\".\n\nIn the mid-late 1990s, MF Grimm went on to release several 12\" singles on Bobbito's Fondle 'Em label and started collaborating extensively with label mate MF Doom whose debut album \"\" was recorded in Grimm's basement, and for which Grimm served as an executive producer (financing the project and supplying samples for the album). It was during this time that Grimm founded the Day By Day Entertainment label, as well as the hip hop collective Monsta Island Czars with MF Doom.\n\nMF Grimm's first release of the 2000s was the collaborative \"MF EP\" with MF Doom on Brick Records. The release included remixes, as well as new material and the instrumental versions to every track.\n\nIn 2001, MF Grimm recorded his debut album, \"\" while on bail after his prison sentencing. The entire album was recorded during a twenty four-hour period, and featured production and appearances from Count Bass D and MF Doom. The album was released on Grimm's Day By Day Entertainment label, although he did not hear the album until after his release from prison several years later. Around the time of MF Grimm's release, Day By Day Entertainment released a compilation of MF Grimm and MF Doom material titled \"Best of MF\". This compilation included features both artists had done, as well as several then-unreleased tracks. Some of the tracks would later be re-released under different titles on various projects.\n\nIn addition to releasing his own material, Grimm has served as an executive producer on various prolific and now-classic albums from the period, including \"\", KMD's \"Black Bastards\" and \"Escape from Monsta Island!\", amongst others.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Grimm completed his second album \"\" in 2004 under his Monsta Island Czars moniker Superstar Jet Jaguar. The album's lyrics as well as drum beats were all created while in prison using a portable drum machine that Grimm managed to hide from the prison guards. Following that release he and MF Doom collaborated once more for his third album, \"Special Herbs + Spices Volume 1\", also released in 2004. This album featured MF Grimm freestyling over MF Doom beats taken from his \"Special Herbs\" instrumental album series. Following this release, MF Grimm released a compilation of material recorded and released prior to \"The Downfall of Ibliys: a ghetto opera\". Underground hit singles, as well as some harder-to-find material, were included and the compilation was released in 2005 as \"Scars & Memories\"\n\nIn 2006, MF Grimm released a 60-track, triple-CD album, \"American Hunger\", the first ever in hip hop on his Day By Day Entertainment label. The album also featured members of Monsta Island Czars. Each of the three discs was intended as a separate \"meal\" -- \"Breakfast,\" \"Lunch\" and \"The Last Supper.\" Included on the album is the track \"The Book of Daniel,\" a scathing diss track recorded in response to MF Doom's diss against Monsta Island Czars (referring to them as \"midgets into crunk\").\n\nGrimm's life story was retold in a graphic novel autobiography illustrated by Ronald Wimberly, \"\", which was released by DC Comics' Vertigo imprint in September 2007. Two months later, MF Grimm appeared on National Public Radio to relate his life story and future plans. That year MF Grimm also released the concept album \"The Hunt for the Gingerbread Man\", with a mixtape \"The Order of the Baker Mixtape\" released as a prequel.\n\nIn 2008, Grimm, under his real name Percy Carey, was nominated for two Eisner Awards for Sentences, Best Reality Based Work and Best Lettering. He was also nominated for, and won, two Glyph Awards for Best Cover and Story of the Year.\n\nIn 2009, Grimm released a short mixtape on the Day By Day Entertainment website entitled \"\" as a promotional release preceding his work in the new decade.\n\nIn 2010, Grimm released his seventh studio album \"\" which was accompanied by a 13-page comic book based on the album by Jim Mahfood.\n\nIn 2012, he collaborated with underground producer Drasar Monumental and the Vendetta Vinyl label to record a series of releases. The first release by the duo was a mixtape entitled \"Preemptive Strike\" followed by \"Good Morning Vietnam\". The duo followed up their success by releasing a full length sequel \"\" in November 2013. This release further explored the Vietnam concept, and introduced heroin as a theme as well. The duo released the third and final iteration to the series, November 25, 2014.\n\nOn February 4, 2015, MF Grimm announced the release of a compilation of his love songs for release on February 14, 2015, titled \"MF Love Songs\". The release is slated to include material from across his entire career.\n\nMF Grimm has used a number of aliases over the years. He was given the name \"Build and Destroy\" by King Sun as a teen, but switched to the name \"The Grimm Reaper\" by the end of the 1980s. \"MF Grimm\" came about from his time living in California, where he was often told that he had \"mad flows.\" As part of Monsta Island Czars, Grimm has used the names Jet Jaguar and Superstar Jet Jaguar. After his release from prison, Grimm also used the GM Grimm moniker, short for Grandmaster Grimm. Since 2004, Grimm has continued to use the \"MF Grimm\" moniker, although he sometimes refers to himself as \"GM Grimm\" or \"Jet Jaguar.\"\n\nIn 1994, Grimm survived an attempted murder where he was shot seven times by rival drug dealers, following a previous three shots in an earlier murder attempt in 1986. As a result of the 1994 attack, he was deafened, blinded, paralyzed from the waist down, and comatose; doctors predicted that he would suffer nulled senses and be paralyzed for the rest of his life. MF Grimm's half-brother and manager Jansen Smalls died in the attack. As a result of this attack, all the music labels interested in Grimm's music cut all contact with him. Grimm recovered full vision, hearing, and speech ability, but still uses a wheelchair.\n\nGrimm founded label Day By Day Entertainment in the late-1990s. At around the same time, he put together his Godzilla-inspired MC collective, the Monsta Island Czars, which at the time also featured MF Doom. However, to pay for the extensive medical bills from his hospitalization, Grimm turned back to drug dealing. This lifestyle eventually caught up with him again when his organization was taken down by the police.\n\nFacing narcotics conspiracy charges, Grimm was sentenced to life imprisonment under the Rockefeller Drug Laws in 2000. Before his sentence began, Grimm recorded his debut album, \"\". In 2003, his life sentence was reduced and was eventually released.\n\nMF Grimm and MF Doom became friends in the early 1990s, bonding over mutual interests in Hip Hop, comics, and mutual friends. Grimm featured on KMD's 1993 single What a Niggy Know (Remix), credited as \"The Grimm Reaper.\" After the death of Doom's brother DJ Subroc and Grimm's paralysis, the two bonded, living together and looking after one another. Although Grimm maintained a presence in Hip Hop, Doom did not reemerge until the late 1990s. Grimm, in his capacity as executive producer, funded \"\" as well as providing the samples which appeared on the album. Grimm also funded the release of KMD's second album \"Black Bastards\", once again serving as an executive producer.\n\nIn 2000, Doom and Grimm released the collaborative \"MF EP\", featuring both artists splitting the record's material, and including the instrumental versions. Upon Grimm's release from prison in 2003, Day By Day Entertainment released a compilation of MF Grimm and MF Doom material as \"Best of MF\". In 2004, the duo released a collaborative album of Grimm rapping over Doom's \"Special Herbs\" beats called \"Special Herbs + Spices Volume 1\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It stars Kevin Costner, Robin Wright (under her married name Robin Wright Penn) and Paul Newman, and was filmed in Maine, Chicago and Wilmington, North Carolina. The film was released on February 12, 1999 by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film was panned by the critics but was a moderate box office hit grossing $118 million against an $80 million budget.\n\nTheresa Osborne, a former reporter, works as a researcher for the \"Chicago Tribune\". On a trip to Cape Cod, she finds a mysterious, intriguing and typed love letter in a bottle in the sand, addressed to Catherine. She is fascinated by it and shows it to her colleagues. They print it in their newspaper without the knowledge of Theresa and get numerous responses. One of the responses contains an attached letter which was addressed to the same person and written in the same tone. Later, they receive another letter of the same kind from one of the readers which was not addressed to Catherine, but typed on the same notepad. Eventually, they track the author down with the help of the typewriter and the notepad used. His name is Garrett Blake and he lives quietly on the Outer Banks of North Carolina near his father, Dodge.\n\nTheresa goes to Outer Banks to research it further but when she meets him, they are attracted to each other and start becoming better acquainted. She tries to tell him about the original purpose of her visit but fears that she might lose him and postpones it. Along with the literal distance between them — they live hundreds of miles apart — there is another problem: Garrett cannot quite forgive Catherine for dying and leaving him.\n\nTheresa's career flourishes as the romantic \"message in a bottle\" tale is told in print, without naming names. Garrett makes a trip to Chicago to visit Theresa and her young son. They seem very happy together for a day, but Garrett sees his letters, becomes furious and starts to leave. But when Theresa reveals that there are three letters of the same kind, he becomes intrigued as he only wrote two of them and comes back to see another letter. The third letter, which was not addressed to Catherine, was actually written by Catherine; in that letter, she reveals her love, her knowledge of her impending death, and how she was content with her life with Garrett, however short it might be. Garrett leaves with the letter, leaving Theresa in tears.\n\nGarrett moves on with his life and sets things straight with Catherine's family, who had been fighting with Garrett for the artworks of Catherine. He finishes his own personalized boat with the help of Catherine's brother and names it 'Catherine', and sends an invitation to Theresa to visit. When Theresa goes there, she witnesses the passionate speech of Garrett about his late wife Catherine and understands that he still is in love with his late wife, and leaves him saying that he is welcome to call her when he thinks he is ready to start a new life.\n\nAfter that night, Garrett writes a letter to Catherine and puts it in a bottle and goes sailing. A storm breaks out and Garrett desperately tries to save a family from a sinking boat and succeeds to save two out of three; however, in the process, he himself drowns. Garrett's father Dodge calls Theresa and tells her about his death. Heartbroken, Theresa goes there to say goodbye; Dodge gives her a letter which was written by Garrett on the day of his death. In that letter, Garrett writes that he found someone else, Theresa who is as dear as Catherine to him and decides to start a new life with her, and asks for Catherine’s blessings. Though devastated, Theresa comes back contented stating that though this experience left her sad, it also helped her to feel the most important thing (Garrett when he died) in life.\n\n\nThe producers originally planned to film on Tangier Island, Virginia, but some members of the town council objected to the drinking, cursing and sex in the film and demanded script revisions in exchange for shooting permission, even though this turned out to be rated PG-13.\n\nWarner Bros. then tried Martha's Vineyard near Chilmark, Massachusetts, but the Chilmark Conservation Commission turned down a request to build a temporary house on stilts in the dunes near Chilmark Pond.\n\nBeach scenes were filmed at Popham Beach in Phippsburg, Maine.\n\nThe fog-bound harbor near the end is New Harbor, Maine. \"None\" of the coastal scenes are the Outer Banks (the setting of the novel), which has neither rocks, bluffs, nor tall pines; nor does the Outer Banks have the roughly 10 foot tides indicated by the docks shown throughout the beginning of the film. Carolina tides average about 5 feet.\n\nIrish music group Clannad wrote the song \"\" for the film. Singer Richard Marx also composed the song \"One More Time\", sung by Laura Pausini, which played during the credits.\n\n\"Message in a Bottle\" has grossed $52,880,016 in North America and $66,000,000 in other territories for a worldwide total of $118,880,016.\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $18,852,976, finishing first at the box office, knocking off \"Payback\" from the top box office ($17,719,502).\n\nThe film received generally negative reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 32% rating, based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The site's consensus states: \"Handsome-looking but dramatically inert, \"Message in a Bottle\" maroons a formidable cast in a trite romance that lacks spark.\" Metacritic reports a 39 out of 100 rating, based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, praising the lead actors, particularly Newman \"steals every scene he's in\", but criticized the contrived ending. Todd McCarthy from \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called it a \"dreary, lachrymose and incredibly poky tear-jerker\" but conceded it had a built in audience among those who put the book on the bestseller list.\n\n\"Message in a Bottle\" was released on DVD on August 3, 1999.\n\n"}

Until 1858, the capital of the Ottoman Empire was governed by a total of 422 kadis.\n\nThe idea to establish a municipality organization in a modern way was first discussed in 1854 during the Crimean War when diplomats and journalists of allied nations came to Constantinople. Later, the parliament accepted a law for the establishment of the office of a mayor (Turkish: Şehremini) and a city council.\n\nSalih Paşa received the first title of Şehremini on July 13, 1858, and governed until November 4, 1858. During the Tanzimat period, 18 mayors took office.\n\nIn 1876, as First constitutional monarchy was proclamated, Kadri Paşa was the mayor of Constantinople. During this period 10 mayors governed Constantinople.\n\nDuring the reign of Young Turks between 1908-1918 and thenafter until the foundation of the republic, 23 mayors served in the capital.\n\nAfter the proclamation of the republic on October 29, 1923, the governor of the city was charged with the duties as deputy mayor. With the municipality act of April 3, 1930, the title of mayor was abandoned and the governor of Istanbul province took over the duties of the mayor. The two separate councils of the province and the municipality were unified. The two councils were reestablished on March 1, 1957.\n\n\nAfter the coup d'etat on May 27, 1960, the military abandoned the mayor and appointed 7 officials until 1963.\n\n\nThe municipality act of July 27, 1963, enabled the election of the mayor. The polls held on November 17, 1963, were the first regional elections to elect the mayor.\n\n\nDuring the military rule from September 12, 1980, until 1984, mayors were assigned.\n\nWith the act of December 4, 1981, the municipality of some big cities in Turkey was reorganized to meet the changed requirements.\n\n\nOn March 8, 1984, the metropolitan municipality act was put into force and on March 23 the municipality of Greater Istanbul was established.\n\n"}

It was redeveloped into a quicker-playing card game named \"Clocktowers\" and published by Jolly Roger Games.\n\n\"Capitol\" is played in 4 rounds and each round is divided into 4 phases: Construction, Improvement, Scoring, and End phase. During the Construction phase the players are able to perform actions with their hand of building, roof, and permit cards.\n\n\nOnce all the players have passed on playing cards, you then proceed to the Improvement phase. This is a very fast bidding phase in which players can win fountains, amphitheaters, or temples.\n\nThen comes the Scoring phase, each of the 9 areas are scored by determining the first and second Players. The first Player in each area receives 2 points. If the area has a fountain, the first and second players receive an additional point. If the area has a temple, all of the points received are doubled.\n\nThe final phase is the End phase. Each player draws 6 cards, one at a time, from the face up stacks of building, roof, and permit cards. If an area has an amphitheater, the first player may draw 2 extra cards and the second player may draw one extra.\n\nThe player with the most points at the end of 4 rounds wins the game.\n"}

{"id": "2115542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2115542", "title": "Philadelphia English", "text": "Philadelphia English\n\nPhiladelphia English is a variety or dialect of American English native to Philadelphia and extending into Philadelphia's metropolitan area throughout the Delaware Valley and South Jersey, including Atlantic City and Wilmington, Delaware. Philadelphia English is one of the best-studied types of English, as Philadelphia's University of Pennsylvania is the home institution of pioneering sociolinguist William Labov. Philadelphia English shares certain features with New York City English and Midland American English, although it is a distinct dialect. The closest relative of the Philadelphia accent is the Baltimore accent, both of which constitute what Labov describes as a single \"Mid-Atlantic\" regional dialect.\n\nAccording to linguist Barbara Johnstone, migration patterns and geography affected the dialect's development, which was especially influenced by immigrants from Northern England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Today, a marked or \"heavier\" Philadelphia accent is most commonly found in Irish American and Italian American working-class neighborhoods. In the city of Philadelphia proper, the dialect has changed in recent years, however, specifically amongst younger residents, and the accent is now spoken by a numerical minority of all Philadelphians within the city itself.\n\nThe Philadelphia and New York accents presumably descended from a common ancestor dialect in the nineteenth century, since both accents in the twentieth century uniquely demonstrated a high vowel (creating a contrast between words like \"cot\" and \"caught\") as well as a phonemic split of the short \"a\" vowel, (making \"gas\" and \"gap\", for example, have different vowels sounds). One important indicator of this is that Philadelphia's short \"a\" split appears to be a simplified variant of New York City's split. Unlike New York City English, however, most speakers of Philadelphia English have always used a rhotic accent (meaning that the \"r\" sound is never \"dropped\").\n\nIn the very late nineteenth century until the 1950s, Philadelphia accents shifted to have more features in common with the then-emerging (and now-common) regional accents of the American South and Midland, for example in fronting , raising , and even some reported weakening of . Philadelphians also began retreating from their longstanding New York City-like accent features after this point, and even further developed their own entirely unique phonological features. Furthermore, higher-educated Philadelphians born in or since the last quarter of the twentieth century are now showing a process of dialect levelling towards General American English features. This includes a remarkable regularity among this demographic in replacing the traditional Philadelphia split with the General American tensing of only before nasal consonants; this probably began around the time the first generation of this demographic attended college. As of today, \"the most strongly supported generalization is that Philadelphia has moved away from its Southern heritage in favor of a Northern system, avoiding those forms that are most saliently associated with local phonology\".\n\nThe vowels in Philadelphia speech have shown volatility across the last century, as Labov's research has identified changes affecting over half of the vowel phonemes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interjection \"yo\" originated in the Philadelphia dialect among Italian American and African American youths. The word is commonly used as a greeting or a way to get someone's attention.\n\nMany Philadelphians are known to use the expression \"youse\" both as second person plural and (rarely) second person singular pronoun, much like the mostly Southern / Western expression \"y'all\" or the Pittsburgh term, \"yinz\". \"Youse\" or \"youse guys\" is common in many working class Northeastern U.S. areas, though it is often associated with Philadelphia especially. However, unlike in other Northeastern U.S. areas, the Philadelphian pronunciation of \"youse\" reflects vowel reduction more often than not, frequently yielding and (\"yiz\") rather than the stereotypical (\"youse\"). (ex: \"Yiz want anything at the store?\" \"Yiz guys alright over there?\"). Second person singular forms commonly are heard as and .\n\n\"Anymore\" is used as a positive polarity item, e.g. \"Joey's hoagies taste different anymore.\" This sense of \"anymore\" is not specific to the region but is well represented there.\n\nA sandwich consisting of a long bread filled with lunch meat, cheese, and lettuce, onion and tomato, variously called a \"sub\" or \"submarine sandwich\" in other parts of the United States, is called a \"hoagie\". Olive oil, rather than mayonnaise, is used as a topping, and \"hot\" or \"sweet\" peppers are used for spice. The term 'hoagie' originated in Philadelphia.\n\nA similar sandwich toasted in an oven or broiler is called a \"grinder\".\n\nSmall chocolate or multi-colored confections sprinkled on ice cream and cake icing, elsewhere called \"sprinkles,\" are known as \"jimmies\" in the Philadelphia area, as well as in the Boston and Pittsburgh areas. (In Boston, only \"chocolate\" sprinkles are called \"jimmies.\")\n\nAnother distinctively Philadelphian word is \"jawn\". According to Dan Nosowitz, \"jawn\" \"...is an all-purpose noun, a stand-in for inanimate objects, abstract concepts, events, places, individual people, and groups of people.\"\n\nThe following well-known Philadelphians represent a sampling of those who have exhibited a rhotic Philadelphia accent:\n\nThese speakers, primarily of Irish, Italian, or Jewish ethnicity, show the non-rhotic version of the Philadelphia accent local to South Philadelphia:\n\nThese speakers retain slight traces or elements of a rhotic Philadelphia accent:\n\n\nActual Philadelphia accents are seldom heard in movies and television, in which actors often mistakenly use a New York accent or simply substitute a General American accent. Philadelphia natives who work in media and entertainment often assimilate to the General American broadcast standard. Speakers with a noticeable local accent include Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC's \"Mad Money\", singer Joe Bonsall, political commentator Chris Matthews, Bam Margera, and several others in the MTV \"Jackass\" crew. Venezuelan American actress Sonya Smith, who was born in Philadelphia, speaks with a Philadelphia accent in both English and Venezuelan Spanish.\n\nMovies and television shows set in the Philadelphia region generally make the mistake of giving the characters a working class New York dialect (specifically heard in films set in Philadelphia such as the \"Rocky\" series, \"Invincible\", and \"A History of Violence\"). A contrary example is the character of Lynn Sear (played by Toni Collette) in \"The Sixth Sense\", who speaks with an accurate Philadelphia dialect. In the film \"Sleepers\", Kevin Bacon, a Philadelphia native, uses an exaggerated Philadelphia accent for the character of Sean Nokes.\n\nThe use of geographically inaccurate dialects is also true in movies and television programs set in Atlantic City or any other region of South Jersey; the characters often use a supposed \"Joisey\" dialect, when in reality that New York-influenced dialect for New Jersey natives is almost always exclusive to the extreme northeastern region of the state nearest New York City. An important factor is that \"local\" TV, political, and sports personalities in South Jersey and part of Central Jersey are culturally associated with Philadelphia, not New York City.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1434, it is the oldest university in Sicily, the 13th oldest in Italy, and the 29th oldest university in the world. With a population of over 60,000 students, it is the main university in Sicily.\nFollowing the Italian higher education reform introduced by the law 240/10 and adopted by the University of Catania in its new Statute, faculties have been deactivated and departments have been reorganized.\nThe University of Catania has now 17 departments, the Faculty of Medicine, and two special didactic units established in the decentralized offices of Ragusa (Modern Languages) and Syracuse (Architecture). that, additionally to the traditional assignments of scientific research, are in charge of the organization and management of educational activities. A special didactic unit is also the school of excellence \"Scuola Superiore di Catania\", a higher education centre of the University of Catania conceived in 1998 to select the best young minds and offer them a course of studies including analysis, research and experimentation.\n\nThe university was founded by King Alfonso V of Aragon (who was also King Alfonso I of Sicily) on 19 October 1434. A charter was granted after two royal councillors (Adamo Asmundo and Battista Platamone) convinced the king to accept the founding of a \"Studium Generale\" in Catania, with the papal recognition arriving ten years later from Pope Eugene IV (18 April 1444). Alfonso V with this gesture wanted to compensate the city (in which there had been recently established the Royal Court) for moving the Sicilian capital from Catania to Palermo. The activity of the Atheneum actually started a year later, in 1445, with 6 professors and 10 students. The first four faculties were Medicine, Philosophy, Canon and Civil Law and Theology. Lessons were initially held in a building in Piazza del Duomo, next to the Cathedral of St. Agatha, and eventually moved to the Palazzo dell'Università in the late 1690s. This building remains the seat of the university to this day. The first degree was awarded to Antonio Mantello, from Syracuse, in 1449. During the course of the 16th century, approximately 20-25 degrees were awarded each year. The University (which from the 16th century was referred to as \"Siculorum Gymnasium\") was named \"Studium Generale\" because it was the only entity that could release degrees equal to those released in the old Studia of Salamanca, Valladolid, Bologna and this contributed to spread envy in the other Sicilian cities that in culture and traditions didn't feel inferior to Catania. In 1934, the university celebrated its 500th anniversary with King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy, and, in 1984 the 550th one.\n\nIn the early centuries of its existence, the university was administered by the comune (municipality) of Catania, overseen by the bishop of Catania and protected by the royal power. But with a reform operated by the viceroy in 1679 the authority of the bishop (who was \"Gran Cancelliere\" = \"Great Chancellor\") prevailed: he had the control over the lecturers, the freshmen and students' curriculum. This led to various conflicts between the civil and religious authorities. From 1818 the office of Gran Cancelliere was assigned to the President of the Great Civil Court, instead of the bishop.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Farmer also noted that the press often referred to the group as the \"Big Four\", excluding Height and John Lewis. Farmer attributed their omission to sexism and age bias, respectively.\n\nPatrick Henry Bass, journalist and historian of the March on Washington, described the rise of these leaders to celebrity: \"Increasingly, these six powerful men lived in two worlds: the political and the personal, one white, in which they were still strangers but becoming increasingly familiar with its insider/outsider rules; the other, black, where they were treated as extended members of the family.\"\n\n"}

Currently there are different groups that claim to be a continuation of the historical PRT.\n\nThe PRT was founded in 1965 by Mario Roberto Santucho (FRIP) and Leandro Fote by merging two existing far-left political parties.\n\nThe origins of the PRT lay in the merger of two leftist organizations in 1965, the Revolutionary and Popular Indoamericano Front \"(Frente Revolucionario Indoamericano Popular (FRIP))\" and Worker's Word \"(Palabra Obrera (PO)\". \n\nThe FRIP had been founded by Francisco René Santucho and his brother Mario Roberto in 1961 at Santiago del Estero, Argentina. It was a ruralist, indigenist (pro-Amerindian) and revolutionary movement that extended its influence throughout the provinces of Tucumán, Chaco and Salta. \"Palabra Obrera\", on the other hand was a Trotskyist party active in the trade unions. Its main strategy had been infiltrating sectors of the Peronist movement in order to win them over to socialism. \n\nIn 1968 the PRT adhered to the Fourth International, based in Paris. That same year a related organisation was founded in Argentina, the ERP (People's Revolutionary Army) that became the strongest rural guerrilla movement in South America during the 1970s. The PRT left the Fourth International in 1973. \n\nBoth the PRT and the ERP were suppressed by the Argentine military regime during the Dirty War. ERP commander Roberto Santucho was killed in July 1976. Owing to the ruthless repression PRT showed no signs of activity after 1977.\n\nThis party should not be confused with the Argentinian Revolutionary Workers' Party \"(Partido Obrero Revolucionario)\".\n"}

She is married to film actor Dilip Kumar. She acted in many hit Bollywood films between 1961 and 1988.\n\nSaira Banu was born in Mussoorie, India to actress Naseem Banu, and film producer Mian Ehsan-ul-Haq, who produced the film \"Phool\" in Mumbai and the film \"Wadah\" in Pakistan. Her maternal grandmother was the courtesan Chamiyan Bai, also known as Shamshad Begum of Delhi (not to be confused with the famous playback singer of yesteryear Shamshad Begum who was from Amritsar, Punjab). Her niece is former actress Shaheen Banu, who is the daughter of her brother Sultan.\n\nSaira spent a significant part of her childhood in London, and went to finishing school. Her maternal grandmother was from Hasanpur (Uttar Pradesh). Her paternal grandfather, Muhammad Suleman, was an architect who served as the Chief Engineer of New Delhi and was later involved in the construction of Jinnah's Mazar in Karachi. Her paternal grandmother, Khatoon Begum, was from Old Delhi's Mohalla Churiwalan, and a daughter of the \"raees\" and public figure, Khan Bahadur Maulvi Abdul Ahad Honorary Magistrate(1850-1920). Her paternal great aunt Khadeeja Begum, was married to the Shahi Imam of the Jama Masjid in Delhi, Ahmed Bukhari.\n\nSaira Banu was 16 years old in 1960, the year she made her debut to Hindi films. She said in a programme that she had basic talent and little dancing experience. Her peers all were classically trained, which was why she wasn't put in the top league. Banu started taking Kathak and Bharata Natyam lessons with success, and trained herself professionally. Soon she became a dancer, and her films featured more of her dancing. \n\nBanu made her acting debut opposite Shammi Kapoor in the 1961 film \"Junglee\", for which she earned her first Filmfare nomination as Best Actress. The famous song from this movie \"Yaahoo!! Chahe Koi Mujhe Junglee Kahe\" sung by Mohammed Rafi was a big success. \"Junglee\" was written by Aghajani Kashmeri (aka Kashmiri and Agha Jani), who also coached her in Urdu dialogue delivery, given his background in Urdu literature and poetry from Lucknow. \"Junglee\" was the beginning of her career as a successful actress throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Her image was that of a romantic heroine for love stories in the 1960s, till 1967. She did one more film opposite Shammi Kapoor, named \"Bluff Master\", directed by Manmohan Desai. \n\nSome of her successful romantic films include \"Jhuk Gaya Aasman\" and \"Aayi Milan Ki Bela\", with Rajendra Kumar, and \"April Fool\", with Biswajeet, \"Aao Pyaar Karen\" and \"Shagird with Joy Mukherjee.\" After her marriage, her first film to release was \"Aman (1967)\", opposite Rajendra Kumar, and she continued to act as the lead heroine till 1977. She appeared in comedy and love story \"Padosan\", in 1968, opposite Sunil Dutt, which brought her to the top league of the successful actresses, and she started receiving more offers. \n\nHer films with Navin Nischol were very successful, such as \"Victoria No. 203\" and \"Paise Ki Gudiya\". In an interview, she quoted that she regretted missing the chance of working with Rajesh Khanna. She quoted: \"I was supposed to work with him in \"Choti Bahu\" (1971), but I could not because I was ill. I shot with him for two days and found that he was very charming, humble and a shy person.\" She earned three additional \"Filmfare\" nominations as Best Actress for \"Shagird\" (1967), \"Diwana\" (1968), and \"Sagina\" (1974).\n\nHer work after \"Sagina\" and \"Bairaag\" (both with Dilip Kumar) and films such as Hrishikesh Mukherjee's \"Chaitali\" met with limited success, although each of them were critically acclaimed. Her only film to be successful at the box office opposite her husband was \"Gopi\". She also had stable pairing with Dharmendra which included \"Jwar Bhata\", \"Aadmi Aur Insaan\", \"Resham Ki Dori\", \"Pocket Maar\", \"International Crook\" and \"Chaitali\". \n\nBanu did \"Pyar Mohabbat\" with Dev Anand and three films with Manoj Kumar, \"Shaadi\", \"Poorab Aur Paschim\" and \"Balidan\". She established herself as a versatile actress after her marriage, with her performances in \"Padosan\", \"Victoria 203\", \"Jhuk Gaya Aasman\", \"Sagina\" and \"Chaitali\" - with each of them belonging to different genres. She was paired with Vinod Khanna in \"Aarop\", wherein the song Naino mein darpan hai became a chartbuster in 1974. Her pairing with Sunil Dutt continued to be solid at the box office with films such as \"Nehle Pe Dehla\" being successful in 1976. The song \"Sawan ka mahina aagaya\" became very popular in 1976. However, with unsuccessful films such as \"Daaman Aur Aag\", \"Mounto\", \"Zameer\" and \"Koi Jeeta Koi Haara\", and with some of her films being kept on hold for release, such as \"Faisla\", \"Mera Vachan Geeta Ki Kasam\" and \"Aarambh\", she decided to not sign for any more films. Hence in 1976, Banu chose to end her film career. She appeared in a cameo opposite her husband in \"Duniya\" (1984), wherein the song \"Teri meri zindagi\" became very popular. Her last film; \"Faisla\", in which she was cast opposite Vinod Mehra, was completed in 1976 and released in 1988.\n\nSaira Banu married actor Dilip Kumar in 1966. Saira Banu was the third highest paid actress in Hindi Cinema from 1963 to 1969 and the fourth highest paid actress from 1971 to 1976.\n\nActress Shaheen is her niece. She is Saira Banu's brother's (Sultan Ahmed's) daughter.\n\nHer husband Dilip Kumar revealed in his 2014 memoir \"Dilip Kumar: The Substance and the Shadow\" that she became pregnant in 1972 with their son, but that she developed high blood pressure in her eighth month of pregnancy and the doctors couldn't save the baby, which had been strangulated by the umbilical cord.

The museum was originally the 1915 residence of newspaper heiress and philanthropist Ellen Browning Scripps, designed by the noted architect Irving Gill.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the name changed to the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, focusing the purview on the period from 1950 to the present. In 1990, the Museum changed its name to San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art, only to change it to Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, after confusion developed between its name and the San Diego Museum of Art. The new name also acknowledged the larger geographic context and the population base of nearly 3 million in San Diego County, and opened a $1.2-million satellite facility downtown in 1993, further embracing the region.\n\nIn 1996, a major $9.2 million renovation and expansion of MCASD La Jolla took place, designed by Robert Venturi of the firm Venturi Scott Brown & Associates. Venturi's addition included four more galleries, doubling the museum's exhibition space to . It also expanded the museum's educational space, storage space, bookstore library and restaurant. It transformed the garden into an outdoor exhibition space for sculpture.\n\nIn 2007, a $25-million downtown location of the Museum was opened, designed by architect Richard Gluckman of Gluckman Mayner Architects, New York. The expansion added of space to the downtown site and increases its exhibition space from about to . At the north end of the building is a three-story structure of corrugated steel and textured glass. It houses curatorial offices, art-handling and storage facilities, an art education classroom, a lecture hall that opens onto a terrace and a boardroom with a view of the harbor. The renovated baggage building is named for Irwin M. Jacobs, founder of the technology company Qualcomm, and his wife, Joan. The three-story Modernist structure bears the name of philanthropist and newspaper publisher David C. Copley.\n\nIn 2014, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego chose architect Annabelle Selldorf to head a $30 million expansion that is expected to triple the size of the museum's location in La Jolla. The project will create more gallery space to exhibit the museum's permanent collection, as well as additional space for education. The museum’s footprint will be expanded to include properties (now residential but owned by the museum) on both sides of the institution, and the space that now houses Sherwood Auditorium will be reconfigured as a gallery with potential exhibit space of approximately 8,000 square feet.\n\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art has a nearly 5,000-object collection of post-World War II art that includes key pieces by color field painter Ellsworth Kelly, minimalist sculptor Donald Judd and renowned California installation artist Robert Irwin. In 2012, museum received 30 contemporary pieces from the 1950s to 1980s, with artworks from Piero Manzoni, Ad Dekkers, Christo, Jules Olitski and Franz Kline, as well as California artists Craig Kauffman and Ron Davis, from the collection of Vance E. Kondon and his wife Elisabeth Giesberger.\n\nThe Copley Building is outfitted with two specially commissioned permanent installations. Roman De Salvo made light fixtures of industrial materials for walls of the stairwell. Outside the building, Jenny Holzer created a parade of her trademark truisms to be spelled out vertically in light-emitting diodes. The words run through clear plastic tubes that she calls icicles.\n\nMCASD has a permanent endowment fund of over $40 million, and an annual operating budget of approximately $6 million. Annual support comes from a balanced mix of individuals, corporations, foundations, government agencies, and interest earned from the endowment, the majority of which came from a transformational 1999 bequest from Rea and Jackie Axline of more than $30 million.\n\nFrom 1983 to 2016, Hugh Davies steered the museum as director. From October 2016, Kathryn Kanjo will become the museum's director and CEO.\n\n"}

Albeit the statistics show that in the beginning of the 21st century the cargo traffic through the canal is in steady decline: in 2015 the volume of freight transferred through the canal is amounted to 1.5 million tonnes while in 1990 it was as large as 3.5 million tonnes. A relevant study suggests this decline exists due to a number of factors. One of them is competition from road and rail transportation, but another one is due to the constrains of the current infrastructure of the canal.\n\nThe current locks of the canal were built in 1916. They are not large enough for modern days freighters, thus they do not have sufficient throughput capacity. Another moment is the age of the locks per se. They were built using technology and materials more than a hundred years ago. Despite regular maintenance they struggle to sustain the effects of water and ice. It is estimated that the locks could not be safely used after 2030.\n\nIn this regard the Swedish transport authorities are planning for 2025-2026 to proceed with the renovation of the canal infrastructure which if to be finished in 2030-2032.\n\nShips classified as \"Vänermax\" are of the maximal measurements that will fit through the canal as follows:\n\n"}

This 17th-century Dutch blacksmith is said to have performed a successful lithotomy on himself in 1651. The painting is part of the Portrait Collection of the Laboratory of Pathology, which is part of the University of Leiden.\n\nThe story on which the painting is based is from Nicolaes Tulp's book entitled \"Observationes medicae\" (1672 edition). In this book, which is a list of 230 'cases' from the Amsterdam practice of Dr. Tulp, the smith is named \"Joannes Lethaeus\", which was a Latinized version of De Doot's name (\"doot\" means \"dead\" in Dutch).

Of Jewish descent and a committed communist, he fled Austria after the annexation for the United States. In 1950, as a result of an investigation of un-American activities, he was offered a professorship in East Berlin. He was married to the renowned pediatrician Ingeborg Rapoport.\n\nThroughout his life Samuel Mitja Rapoport saw danger and exile. Rapoport was born in Wolhynia near the Russian-Austrian border in what is now the Ukraine and his family resided there from 1912 to 1916. They later moved to Odessa, Russia on the Black Sea coast. At the conclusion of the World War I he saw the Russian Revolution and witnessed the barbaric warfare of the Russian Civil War.\n\nHis family left Odessa for Vienna, Austria in 1920. Already sympathetic to left-wing views, he joined the Communist Party out of protest against the rise of fascism. At the age of 13 years he found in his father's archives works written by Friedrich Engels. By reading them he was fascinated by socialist ideas. His own painful experiences of war, injustice, banishment, political and racial persecution brought him to a socialist world-view up to his end of life. He was active in communist organizations from his youth and became a member of the Socialist pupils in Vienna, then he participated in the illegal Austrian communist movement. But he didn't follow ideological extremes. He was directed by a deep humanity, he loved reasoning and discussing, he had a great inquiring mind and he had the ability to connect theoretical knowledge, philosophical views and practical realization.\n\nIn Vienna he studied medicine and chemistry receiving his doctorate. In 1933 he attended the Institute for Medical Chemistry and worked on the analysis of amino acids in the blood serum.\n\nWhen the annexation of Austria by Nazi-Germany was imminent, he received a scholarship for scientific studies and clinical work at the Children’s Hospital Research Foundation in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1938. At the time this hospital was a leader in research and medical treatment. During his tenure at this hospital he served as a pediatrician and earned a second doctorate.\n\nDuring World War II his research focused on blood conservation. He worked to prolong the shelf life of blood altering conservation media in order to preserve the energy metabolism of erythrocytes. He succeeded in extending the maximum storage time for blood from one to three weeks. His efforts saved the lives of thousands of US soldiers, marines, sailors and airmen. For these efforts he was honored by President Harry S. Truman with a Certificate of Merit.\n\nIn 1944 while in Cincinnati he met the German emigrant and physician Ingeborg Syllm, they married in 1946. Ingeborg Syllm, born in 1912 in Cameroon was the daughter of a Protestant couple, she had studied medicine in Hamburg, and fled to the US in September 1938.\n\nWhile in the US he supported the trade union and communist movement. Together with his wife he delivered the paper \"The Worker\" on the weekends and got involved with the civil rights movement. His political views polarized his colleagues.\n\nDespite his gratitude towards the United States, which had offered him citizenship and work, Rapoport continued to be politically active as a member of the Communist Party. During a congress of pediatricians in Switzerland in 1950 he received information that he was a target of the anticommunist McCarthy commission. As a result of this warning he chose not to return to the US and his wife brought their children to Zurich. The Rapoports moved to Vienna, where for a short time he again worked at the Institute for Medical Chemistry. But the university refused his appointment for professorship due to the intervention of the US government. France, Great Britain and the Soviet Union all refused his services. Rapoport rejected a job offer by the Weizmann Institute in Israel on the grounds of his anti-Zionist beliefs.\n\nIn 1951 the East German Humboldt University in East Berlin offered Rapoport the professorship and directorship of the Institute for Physiological Chemistry at the Charité Hospital. He accepted political asylum as well as the chance to continue his work.\n\nWhile in Berlin he wrote the text, \"Medical Biochemistry\" dictated in only three months. This book became a bestseller in both the medical communities in East and West Germany. It was printed in 9 editions with 60,000 copies, and was translated in several languages.\n\nSamuel Rapoport was the most important representative of East German biochemistry. Several of students of Rapoport were appointed to professorships. After the unification of Germany he became president of the newly founded Leibniz-Societät, which consisted of former members of the disbanded Academy of Sciences of the GDR.\n\nWhen in 1982 the committee \"Physicians of GDR for prevention of nuclear war\" was founded, Rapoport was elected the chairman. Up to his death he continued fighting against nuclear weapons.\n\nIngeborg Rapoport continued to be active in her medical profession and in social action. She worked from 1952 as pediatrician in Berlin. In 1964 she became a professor and had the professorship for neonatology of the Charité Hospital from 1969 to 1973. She was co-founder of the Society of Perinatology of the GDR and council-member of the European Society of Perinatology.\n\nThe children of Samuel and Ingeborg Rapoport are the biochemist Tom, who up to 1995 worked at the Berlin Max-Delbrück-Centrum, and now is at Harvard University, the mathematician Michael who works at the University of Bonn. One daughter is pediatrician in Berlin, another a nurse.\n\nIn May 2015, Ingeborg Rapoport defended a doctoral dissertation about diphtheria that she submitted in 1938 to the University of Hamburg. The Nazi regime then in power had prevented her from taking the required oral examination due to her being part Jewish, but after updating her scientific knowledge about diphtheria, she passed a 45-minute examination by three professors from the university 77 years later, at age 102. She is scheduled to receive her degree in a ceremony on June 9, making her the oldest known person in history to receive a doctorate.\n\nHis work focused on the water-electrolyte balance and the metabolism of the erythrocytes. He described the role of the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate for the anaerobic production of energy in the erythrocytes (Luebering-Rapoport pathway). Jane Luebering was a technical assistant of Rapoport. Rapoport detected the eminent importance of the ATP concentration for the survivability of the erythrocytes.\n\nIn World War II there was a great need of transfusions. Many scientists worked on an improvement of the defensibility of the blood bottles (C.R. Drew, P. Rous, J.R. Turner, J.F. Loutit, P.L. Mollison, I.M. Young u.a.). Among them Rapoport was very successful. Due to his works the ACD-medium was established, the pH-environment, the storage temperature and the processing were improved. His research was supported by Paul Hoxworth, who founded in 1938 one of the first United States blood banks in Cincinnati. Thus the survivability of the bottled blood could be extended from 1 to 3 weeks.\n\nIn 1948, together with two other American physicians he reported his results about the Ekiri disease in Japan. They showed the helpfulness of infusions with calcium which ameliorated the symptoms like convulsions.\n\nIn 1952 Rapoport founded at the Berlin Charité a Biochemical Institute. His scientific interest was to further the clinical-biochemical research, especially the investigation of reticulocytes and of the enzyme lipoxygenase. He was an early a representative of the thesis that the degradation of proteins is energy-dependent.\n\nThe pharmaceutical production of insulin in the GDR was encouraged by him.\n\nUp to 1996 Rapoport published or was a participant in 666 scientific works. In 1969 he became a member of the Academy of Science of the German Democratic Republic. He received several honorary doctorates. The documentary \"Die Rapoports – Unsere drei Leben\" (The Rapoports – our three lives, ARTE/ZDF 2003), by Sissi Hüetlin and Britta Wauer (2005 awarded the Adolf-Grimme-prize) is a testament to the lives of the scientists Samuel and Ingeborg Rapoport.\n\n\n"}

He was also an Arena Football League player, who played quarterback for the Albany Firebirds and the Fort Worth Cavalry. He played college football at Texas A&M University–Commerce from 1980–1983 where he was an All-American and led the Lions to the 1983 Lone Star Conference Championship. His father was Dee Mackey, a former tight end for the New York Jets.\n\nMackey was born in Gladewater, Texas and lived part of his life in Alpine, Texas when his father was a high school coach after leaving the NFL. His family moved back to East Texas before his high school years. As a student (at Spring Hill High School in Longview, Texas) he set multiple passing records and was selected to the all-state team in both his Junior and Senior years. Mackey accepted an athletic scholarship to Texas A&M-Commerce (then East Texas State University) where he was to play both Football and Basketball.\n\nMackey played for the Texas A&M-Commerce Lions from 1980–1983. As a Freshman in 1980, he backed up All-American and future All-Pro Wade Wilson, a year in which the Lions were NAIA National Semifinalists.\n\nMackey took over at the starting spot during the 1981 season. He led the Lions to a 7–4 record and a fifth-place finish in the Lone Star Conference, throwing for 2.074 yards and 18 touchdowns. He was an Honorable Mention All Lone Star Conference Selection.\n\nAs a Junior Mackey threw for 1,667 yards and 11 touchdowns and led the Lions to a 6–4 record, good enough for LSC conference runner-up (2nd place).

In 2001, as a 12-year-old, she became the youngest player to qualify for the U.S. Women's Open. She was the 2005 American Junior Golf Association (AJGA) Player of the Year, and won the 2006 AJGA Nancy Lopez Award. She turned pro at age 17, and is the youngest-ever winner of a modern LPGA major championship, when at age 18 she won the 2007 Kraft Nabisco Championship (now known as the ANA Inspiration) and vaulted to a career-high fourth in the world rankings.\n\nBorn in Tampa, Florida, to Mike Pressel and Kathy Krickstein Pressel, she attended Banyan Creek Elementary School, Omni Middle School, and graduated in 2006 from the Saint Andrew's School in Boca Raton, a private school affiliated with the Episcopal Church. She has stated that her Jewish faith plays a large role in her life.\n\nFollowing her mother's death from breast cancer in September 2003, 15-year-old Pressel moved in with her maternal grandparents, Evelyn Krickstein and Dr. Herb Krickstein at St. Andrews Country Club in Boca Raton, Florida. Dr. Krickstein, a retired physician and pathologist is also her coach, while her two younger siblings stayed with their father. Her grandparents are the parents of former top-10 tennis player Aaron Krickstein, Pressel's uncle and the Director of Tennis at St. Andrews Country Club.\n\nPressel's younger sister Madison played collegiate golf for the University of Texas and won on the Symetra Tour in 2014.\n\nIn January 2013, Pressel married Andy Bush, a senior vice president at Octagon Global Events. The two met at a pro-am event in 2007.\n\nIn 2001, as a 12-year-old, she became the youngest player to qualify for the U.S. Women's Open. This record stood until 2007, when Lexi Thompson beat the record by several months.\n\nAt the age of 17, she was one of three co-leaders starting the final round of the 2005 U.S. Women's Open at Cherry Hills in suburban Denver. Pressel was tied for first on the 18th fairway when Birdie Kim holed out from the bunker just ahead to secure a one-stroke lead. Pressel then needed a birdie to tie, but made a bogey on the 18th to lose by two strokes. Her second-place finish gave her a share of the low amateur honors with Brittany Lang. Pressel played in a total of seven LPGA events in 2005 and made the cut in all of them, with a scoring average of 70.96 in 28 rounds.\n\nIn 2005, Pressel won the North and South Women's Amateur at Pinehurst, and the most important amateur event, the U.S. Women's Amateur. Pressel also finished her amateur career as 2005 Girls Rolex Junior Player of the Year.\n\nDuring her amateur career, she won 11 AJGA titles, including all five AJGA Invitationals: the \"AJGA Slam\".\n\nPressel finished sixth in the first stage of the LPGA Qualifying Tournament in September 2005 and advanced to the final stage in December. She turned professional in November, after appealing to the LPGA to become a member as a 17-year-old. LPGA rules state that members must be 18 years old. At the five-round Final Qualifying Tournament in Daytona Beach, she finished tied for sixth to earn her tour card for 2006. She played part-time on the tour until her high school graduation in May 2006.\n\nPressel earned her first victory in 2007 at the Kraft Nabisco Championship and became the youngest-ever winner of a modern LPGA major at , a record that would stand until Lydia Ko won the 2015 Evian Championship at the age of 18 years, 4 months and 20 days. On her flight home to Florida after her win, Pressel had her golf clubs stolen. The win moved her from 17th in the world rankings to fourth.\n\nPressel made her first hole-in-one as a professional golfer on July 15, 2007, at the Jamie Farr Owens Corning Classic at Highland Meadows Golf Club in Sylvania, Ohio. It was a par 3 – hole 6 for the tournament. It was not enough to win, though; Se Ri Pak won the event for the fifth time.\nPressel qualified for the 2007, 2009 and 2011 Solheim Cup teams; earning a spot on the 2007 team in her second full-year on the LPGA Tour as a 19-year-old.

{"id": "2115639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2115639", "title": "Zaramo people", "text": "Zaramo people\n\nThe Zaramo people, also referred to as Dzalamo or Saramo, are an East African ethnic group found along the coast of Tanzania, particularly in its Pwani Region. They are the largest ethnic group in and around Dar es Salaam, the former capital of Tanzania and the 7th largest city in Africa. Estimated to be about 0.7 million people, over 98% of them are Muslims, more specifically the Shafi'i school of Sunni Islam. Their culture and history have been shaped by their dwelling in both urban and rural landscapes.\n\nBy oral tradition, the Zaramo are said to be descendants of the Shomvi people under the lead of the warrior-hero, Pazi in the early 19th century. The Shomvi, a mercantile clan living in what is present-day Dar Es Salaam were attacked by an offshoot group of Kamba people from Kenya. The Shomvi sought help from the warrior, Pazi, who lived in the hinterlands. When Pazi defeated the Kamba, he asked for salt, cloth, and other luxuries in return. When the Shomvi could not meet his demands, they offered for him and his family to live with them on the coast, where they would receive an annual tribute instead. The war and its results were said to be the founding of the Zaramo.\n\nThe original Zaramo language, sometimes called Kizaramo, is Bantu, belonging to the Niger-Congo family of languages. However, in contemporary Tanzania, only a few speak it, and most speak Swahili language as their first language, as it is the trading language of the East African coast and the national language of Tanzania.\n\nKizaramo is still used in many Zaramo rituals, such as the \"mwali\" rites, though they often appear alongside Swahili translations.\n\nThe term, \"Zaramo,\" in scholarly studies also reflects a macro-ethnic group. The larger Zaramo group consists of Zaramo proper, but includes a number of related peoples such as the Kaguru, Kwere, Kutu, Kami, Sagara, Luguru, Ngulu and Vidunda peoples.\n\nThe Zaramo society has been historically victimized by slave raids and slave trading by the Swahili-Arab traders of Zanzibar. To resist this persecution, they developed stockade-fortified villages. Many ran away from the coast, and would return during the daytime to farm and fish. Zanzibar Arabs, state William Worger, Nancy Clark and Edward Alpers, however pursued their slave raiding into the mainland, where they would seize pagan Zaramo adults and children, gag them so they would not cry out, and then sell them to the traders. Sometimes during famines, such as in the 19th-century rule of Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar, desperate Zaramo people pawned and sold each other to survive.\nThe Zaramo society's history has long been influenced by the coastal encounter between the Arab-Persian and African populations typical of East Africa, since the 8th century. During the colonial era, the influence came from the encounter between the African people, Arab-Swahili trader intermediaries and the European powers, but it broadly coopted the older slave-driven, social stratification model.\n\nAccording to Elke Stockreiter – a professor of History specializing on Africa, the slaves seized from Zaramo people and other ethnic groups such as Yao, Makonde and Nyamwezi peoples from the mainland and brought to the coastal Tanzania region and Zanzibar sought social inclusion and attempted to reduce their treatment as inferiors by their slave owners by adopting and adapting to Islam in the 19th century. Conversion to Islam among the coastal Zaramo people began in the 19th century. These historic events, states Stockreiter, have influenced the politics and inter-ethnic relations in 20th-century Tanzania.\n\nInitiation rituals are required for the youth of the Zaramo people to become full-fledged members of adult society. Theses rituals generally happen around puberty and the female's first menses.\n\nThe male ceremony is termed as \"nhulu\" or \"growth.\" The initiation process takes place during the dry season and about once every three years. Each novice, \"mwali,\" have a designated instructor, \"mhunga,\" who guides the youth through the circumcision process, teaches Zaramo sex lore and practice. Once the \"mwali\" are circumcised, they are brought to an initian hut, \"kumbi,\" where they are taught, and then are not permitted to bathe for two weeks. Once the \"mwali\" are allowed to bathe again, their mothers in the village hold a village dance, \"mbiga.\" After eight more days the \"mwali\" return to the village and their instructors burn the \"kumbi\" and anything else related to the initiation. The \"mwali\" are now men of society and celebrate with \"mlao,\" a dance of emergence.\n\nFemale initiation begins with a girl's first menses. The rituals associated with female initiation are performed to protect and enrich a girl's female power and her fertility. A girl has a reproductive cycle within society-one that starts with her first menses, continues to her initiation, marriage, birth of her children, and finally ends with the puberty of her grandchildren, at which point her reproductive cycle is over. The girl novice, also called \"mwali,\" is secluded in her mother's house for anywhere between two weeks and one year. Earlier documentation states that this process in the past could have taken up to five years. The \"mwali's\" paternal aunt is usually assigned as her \"shangazi\", or the one who takes over the \"mwali's\" teachings and ceremonies. The initiate is taught domestic responsibilities such as housekeeping, childcare, sexual and moral behavior, and mature interaction in society. During seclusion, the \"mwali\" is not allowed to speak, work, or go outside, to symbolize her death and put emphasis on her re-emergence as symbolic birth. She is then carried to a mkole tree where is circumcised as well by an operator, or \"mnhunga.\" She is then returned to her family and she is celebrated with an \"mbwelo\" dance.\n\n\"Mwana Hiti\" figures may also be referred to as \"mwana nya kiti, mwana nya nhiti,\" or \"mwana mkongo.\" These names stem from \"mwana,\" meaning \"child,\" and \"nya kiti\" and \"nya nhiti\" meaning \"wood\" and \"chair.\" \"Mkongo\" refers to the mkongo tree, of which many mwana hiti are carved from. All of these names refer to the \"mwana hiti\" as a \"child of wood.\" \"Mwana hiti\" may be represented in other forms besides figures such as walking sticks, staff, stool, musical instruments, and grave posts among others. \"Mwana hiti\" don't belong to individuals, but to families, and they are passed down generations, sometimes up to 40 or 50 years.\n\n\"Mwana hiti\" are usually made of wood, however some Zaramo traditions say they should be made of gourds as gourds are symbols of fertility. Sizes of the \"mwana hiti\" vary, the average being around 10 centimeters. They can be projections of a child, a woman with a child, or an \"mwali.\" \"Mwana hiti\" are cylindrical figures with depictions of a head and torso of relatively equal size and usually no arms, legs or genitalia. Breasts and a navel are often present as well as hair. Facial features are simple and abstract, occasionally not being present. These figures may be decorated with metal (if hair is present) or white beads as jewelry.\n\n\"Mwali hiti\" are meant to spark a \"nurturing consciousness\" within the \"mwali\" to instill a desire to have children. They also act as the main socializing for the \"mwali\" during her seclusion, measuring her skills as a future mother and teaching her the responsibilities of womanhood (i.e. taking care of oneself and children.)\n\n\"Mwali\" must treat the \"mwana hiti\" as her child, bathing it, oiling it, dressing the hair (of which the \"mwali\" wears the same style,) and feeding it. If she fails to complete these motherly tasks she may be denied fertility in the future. Fertility is prized in Zaramo culture as children are seen as economic and cultural goals for prosperity and legacy.\n\nIf a woman encounters fertility after her initiation is over, she may choose to repeat seclusion and \"mwana hiti\" rites. This means the \"mwana hiti\" can also double as a \"tambiko\", or \"sacrifice,\" as a means to create stronger ties with the spiritual world.\n\nMen are the carvers of \"mwana hiti\", many creating reputations for their highly sought after figures. \"Mwana hiti\" are only commissioned, and there can't be more than one figure commissioned by a family at a time. Carvers also cannot create \"mwali hiti\" if a family already possesses one. The carver creates \"mwana hiti\" out of one piece of wood (or gourd) that he picks out, though any decorations for hair or jewelry must be provided by the family.\n\nThe Zaramo people have adopted the Swahili–Arab culture in terms of dress such as wearing a skull cap, Islamic festivals and Muslim observances, but they continue some of their pre-Islam traditions such as matrilineal kinship, while a few pursue the \"Kolelo\" fertility cult and the worship of their ancient deity \"Mulungu\". The traditional practice of \"Mganga\" or medicine man, along with Muslim clerics offering services as divine healers, remains popular among the impoverished Zaramo communities.\n\nThe Zaramo people are settled farmers who also keep livestock and fish, but they also are migrant workers to Tanzania's capital city and tourist sites, considering business, or \"biashara,\" their job. They live in \"pangone\" or shanty clusters of villages. They produce staple foods such as rice, millet, maize, sorghum, and cassava, as well as cash crops such as coconuts, legumes, cashews, pineapples, oranges, and bananas. Cassava is important to Zaramo agriculture because it can grow with very little rain.\n\nFor Zaramo people who live on the coast, fishing is also popular for both personal consumption and trade. Some Zaramo may also choose to brew beer, make chacoal, or dig for copal for a living. Those with specialized professions, \"mafundi\", or as healers and diviners, \"mganga\", rarely work those positions full time, often working agriculturally to supplement.\n\nThe independence of Tanganyika in 1961 and the Zanzibar Archipelago in 1963 and their subsequent formation of the United Republic of Tanzania led to a significant shift in Tanzanian culture, as well as the Zaramo culture. In 1963, 132 chiefs and headmen were removed from their political positions as government executives. The decreased status of chiefs and headmen has led to the dwindling of their numbers and traditions associated with them.\n\nZaramo people hold their dead with high respect and reverence. They believe that life is continued into death, in which the spirits of the dead, \"mizimu\", only bring misfortune upon the living. Illness, death, infertility, and poor agriculture can all be attributed to the spitefulness of \"mizimu.\" \"Tambiko\" are funeral rites where the family clean the grave and offer food and drink to each other and the deceased. Sometimes a temporary hut is built around the grave to act as a shrine. After Tanzanian independence in the 1960s, an increasing number of Zaramo people have requested to be buried in their home villages on private land or on church grounds.\n\nThe influence of Islam and the increase of urbanization and literacy have been marked as responsible for the decline in traditional Zaramo figure grave posts. The majority of contemporary grave markers are slab markers with written sentiments and notifiers. Decreasing land availability in Dar Es Salaam has led to an increase in unmarked grave sites holding multiple bodies, which has resulted in a higher importance being placed upon sufficient grave marking.\n\nTraditional Zaramo grave figures have a variety of names: \"mwana hiti\" (no longer in contemporary use,) \"nguzo za makaburi\" (translated to \"grave posts,\") \"mashahidi wa makaburi\" (translated to \"grave witness.\") These figures are considered witnesses or representation of the deceased. \"Mwana hiti\" grave figures are separate from \"mwana hiti\" initiation figures, and were mainly used for headmen or chief graves. Sometimes grave markers are created as marionette-like, wooden puppets called \"motto wa bandia\" to become mnemonic honorary devices.\n\nStaffs, aside from their use as walking supports, are used as ritual aids, titular symbols, and representations of power. Specific staffs are usual signifiers of chiefs, diviners, and linguists.\n\nLiterally translated to \"small stick,\" \"kifimbo\" staffs are small staffs used mainly for military authority. It is either held in the hand or tucked between the upper arm and the torso. \"Kifimbo\" hold no functional use, and are considered purely symbolic.\n\nTraditional \"kome\" staffs are tall staffs made from blackwood (\"mpingo\") and are carved to possess animal and human (women) decoration. \"Mwana hiti\" were common top decorations before Tanzanian independence. \"Kome\" staffs are typically associated with chief power, and so their decreased presence is directly correlated to that of chiefs in Tanzania.\n\nBy early-mid 20th century, much of Zaramo pottery consisted of internal creations and imports from Europe, Japan, and India. Most of Zaramo pottery consists of ceramic water jars and earthenware cooking pots and dishes. Pottery is generally made for kitchen-use, thus resulting in two main types/uses: vessels for liquid (narrow-rimmed) and vessels for cooking and serving food (open and curved rims.)\n\nCooking dishes may range from 5-12 inches in diameter and 2-3 inches in height, usually topped with an open, flared rim. General cooking pots are called \"chungu,\" while dishes made specifically for the act of frying are called \"kaango\" or \"kikaango\" (depending on size), with smaller bowls being referred to as \"bakuli.\" \"Chetezo\" or \"Kitezo\" are shallow dishes made to be placed on shrine pedestals to hold incense offerings.\n\n\"Mtungi\" are large pots, sometimes reaching 2 feet high, that are made particularly to hold water for bathing and drinking; a household generally has two of these vessels, one for each use. Sometimes \"mtungi\" are replaced with buckets or oil drums, the manufactured alternatives being more durable, though they keep the water less cool. \"Mtungi\" tend to have more fragile necks prone to cracking and chipping.\n\nThere is not much distinction between pottery for everyday use and pottery for rituals, such as ceremonial \"mwali\" bathing, healing rituals, and grave offerings.Everyday pottery may be used, though many ceremonies require the vessel to be new.\n\nThe majority of potters in Zaramo culture are women, who are called \"fundi wa kufinyanga\" or \"masters of making pottery.\" Pottery is seen as a job that complements the agricultural and domestic responsibilities assigned to women. Apart from most of Africa, Zaramo women do not sell their pottery in markets, instead operating on an order/commission system. While any women may choose to practice pottery, many women are taught by older relatives when they are \"mwali\", a time when girls are secluded in the home and normally learn domestic skills. Pottery is a physically strenuous task, which is the main reason a woman may retire from the practice.\n\nGood clay is the most essential part of Zaramo pottery, with many potters choosing to mix several types of clay to achieve maximum durability through the firing process. A pottery wheel is not used; instead, \"pinch pot\" techniques (generally for smaller vessels) and coiling methods (generally for larger vessels) are used. After being formed, the pottery are left to dry out for 2–7 days before being fired, not in a kiln, but a wood fire. The vessels are placed on top of a fire, and more wood and plant material are placed on top of the vessels. Firing lasts 2–3 hours. If the pottery is to be colored, they are colored directly after firing.\n\nThe bodies of vessels are burnished using seeds, metal, stones or shells, while necks/rims are smoothed with leaves or paper.\n\nColor is added directly after firing and mostly consists of reds and blacks. Red pigment is made from either the boiling of the mzingifuri plant (where the vessel is dipped into the pigment) or from the heating of kitahoymse grass seeds (which are turned into a solid mass that is then rubbed onto a just-fired vessel to transfer pigment.) Black pigment is made from powdering tree bark (usually mango tree bark) and mixing it with water or citrus juice.\n\nOrnamentation of pottery is appreciated in Zaramo culture, but is not integral. Decoration is either incised (using millet stalks, bamboo, or shells) or painted on. Lids, or \"funiko\", aren't incised, only painted. \"Biiki\" are comb-like tools made to create incised parallel lines. All incised decorations are called \"marembo\" or \"mapambo,\" but there are specific names for other patterns such as \"huku na huku\" (zig-zag,) \"mistari\" (vertical lines,) and \"ukumbuo\" (horizontal lines).\n\nBasketry is a very common practice in Zaramo and Tanzanian culture and can be broken down into several types.\n\n\"Pakacha\" are baskets that are made for only a day or two's use. They are made of fresh palm leaves and are often used to transport small amounts of items/wares, whether for travel or for the marketplace. They are disposable and are made by common people, not specialists. \"Tenga\" are larger sturdier versions of \"pakacha.\" They are made to carry heavy loads and are, therefore, made with bamboo instead of palm leaves. \"Ungo\" (food and winnowing trays) and \"kikota\" (small beer vessels) also use bamboo, though it is more tightly woven.\n\n\"Kawa\" are decorated food covers made from wild date palms called \"mkindu\". They are often decorated with Swahili proverbs, fruits, vegetables, and flowers. Similar to \"kawa\" are fans called \"vipepeo\". Types of mats include \"mkeka\" (large rectangular mats for sitting,) \"msala\" (oval prayer mats,) \"jamvi\" (large, sturdy mats for porch covering,) \"vitanga\" (smaller, ovular versions of \"jamvi,\") and \"kumba\" (matting for fences and walls.)\n\nBasketry is created using mainly bamboo, dwara palm leaves, and date palm leaves. The plant fibers are then put into plaits, of which there are many different types such as \"jicho la kuku\" for \"eye of the chicken,\" \"pacha\" for \"crossroads,\" and \"vinyota\" as \"stars.\" Once the plant fibers are plaited into long strips, they are sewn together to create the desired basketry shape. Basketry used to be sewn together with coconut fibers, but today it is more common to use twine or plastic from bags. Many baskets are designated to be natural in color, though some are dyed. Dying of baskets, if done, is usually in black or red-orange made from roots of the \"mdaa\" plant or berries of the \"mzingefuri\" respectively. The only tools needed are a paring knife and a needle or an awl.\n\nWhile anyone can learn to make basketry, it is usually taught through family. Basketry-makers are called \"fundi kusuka,\" \"masters of plaiting.\" Basketry, like pottery, is considered a part-time job only. It is typical for men to handle weaving that uses bamboo and for women to do the weaving that uses palm leaves. Men usually perform the decorating.\n\n\n"}

Prior to accepting the head coaching position at UNC he spent one season as head coach of the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball program.\n\nAs a college player, Doherty started on the 1981–82 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team, which on March 29, 1982, won the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, defeating the University of Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team by a score 63–62. At UNC, Doherty played under the legendary college coach Dean Smith, and started alongside future National Basketball Association stars James Worthy, Sam Perkins, Kenny Smith, and Michael Jordan, with Jordan considered by many to be the greatest player in the history of the game.\n\nPrior to being named the head coach at Notre Dame, Doherty served as an assistant coach first at Davidson, then at Kansas. After leaving UNC, Doherty would go on to become head coach of the Florida Atlantic Owls, and the SMU Mustangs.\n\nOutside of coaching, Doherty has also served as a college basketball commentator and as an NBA scout. His broadcast roles have included serving as a color commentator for various high school and college programs including Davidson. Doherty was most recently was the Atlantic 10 Conference's associate commissioner for men's college basketball, resigning in April, 2019.\n\nDoherty was born in East Meadow, New York. In his teenage years, he went to high school at Holy Trinity DHS in Hicksville, New York Bob McKillop was his coach during his first two years at Holy Trinity. Doherty was the first freshman McKillop started on his varsity Holy Trinity teams.\n\nDoherty was on the 1980 Holy Trinity team that won the Class A New York state high school boys basketball championship.\n\nWhile at Holy Trinity, Doherty was named to the second team of the \"Parade\" All-America Boys Basketball Team, in 1979. Doherty was also a McDonald's All-American, playing in the 1980 game.\n\nIn October 1979, Doherty committed to playing for the Tar Heels. Other schools tried to recruit Doherty before he could legally sign his letter of intent, but North Carolina basketball staffers checked on Doherty, calling and visiting him until he could sign his letter of intent.\n\nDoherty was a reserve forward during his freshman year. He played all but nine games in the first half of his freshman year because of a fractured left thumb. In the 28 games he played in his freshman year, Doherty had 67 assists and averaged six points and three rebounds per game. He played in the 1981 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game loss against Indiana.\n\nIn the summer of 1981, Doherty played on the South team in the National Sports Festival.\n\nDoherty didn't start during his freshman year in part because of Dean Smith's reluctance to start freshmen. By his sophomore year, Doherty was chosen as a starting forward. He appeared on the November 30, 1981 \"Sports Illustrated\" issue previewing the 1981-82 season, announcing that season's North Carolina team as the preseason number one team according to the AP Poll. Smith's other upperclassmen starters for that team--James Worthy, Sam Perkins, and Jimmy Black—also appeared on the cover with Smith. (Michael Jordan, one of Smith's few freshmen starters, was omitted from the cover because Smith didn't allow media coverage of freshmen players before they played their first game.)\n\nDoherty made 71 of his 92 free throw attempts, converting .772 percent of his free throws; his free throw percentage was the best of any player on the 1981-82 team. He also had 105 assists and averaged 9.3 points and three rebounds per game. Doherty scored at crucial points of North Carolina's postseason; he scored the three winning free-throws in North Carolina's victory against Virginia in the 1982 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament, and he was one of the high scorers of the 1982 NCAA East Regional Semifinal game against Alabama. He was also an ACC All-Tournament Second Team selection.\n\nDoherty led the 1982-83 team in assists, with 150 assists. He averaged 10.5 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. Doherty was also named the team's most outstanding defensive player that season.\n\nIn the 1983 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament quarterfinal against Clemson, Doherty scored 28 points, the most points he scored in an individual game during his college career. He made the ACC All-Tournament Second Team for the second consecutive year.\n\nBefore his senior season, Doherty played on the 1983 United States Select team.\n\nDoherty was a co-captain of the 1983-84 team, along with Perkins and Cecil Exum. Doherty was also this team's assist leader, with 124 assists. He averaged 9.8 points and four rebounds per game.\n\nIn his last ACC Tournament in 1984, Doherty was named as an All-ACC Tournament First Team selection. He also was on the ACC All-Academic team.\n\nAt North Carolina, Doherty was a four-year letterman. Doherty was the second person in ACC history to earn 1,000 points, 400 rebounds, and 400 assists over a collegiate career. In the four seasons Doherty played with North Carolina, the Tar Heels amassed a record of 117 wins and 21 losses and won the 1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.\n\nDoherty was the 1984 recipient of the Jim Tatum Memorial Award, an award given by the Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that honors athletes who also participate in community activities.\n\nDoherty graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill in 1984 with a degree in business administration.\n\nAfter graduating from UNC-Chapel Hill, Doherty entered the 1984 NBA Draft. He was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the sixth round, with the 119th overall pick. Doherty signed a contract with the Cavaliers on September 25, 1984, only to see the contract voided three days later. Doherty never played in the NBA.\n\nDoherty wanted nothing to do with basketball after seeing his contract get voided. He worked as a bonds salesman on Wall Street for three years, but hated it. Doherty admitted to quitting his Wall Street job at the press conference held shortly after he was named head coach of Notre Dame.\n\nDoherty moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he worked as an executive search consultant. Around the same time, Doherty did color commentary for North Carolina, Davidson, St. Francis (NY), and high schools in the Charlotte area.\n\nDoherty started his coaching career with a Charlotte-based Amateur Athletic Union team, coaching alongside former multi-sport Tar Heel athlete Charles Waddell. Doherty coached Jeff McInnis before McInnis came to UNC-Chapel Hill.\n\nIn 1989, Doherty was hired as an assistant basketball coach at Davidson, where McKillop was the head coach. Doherty was an assistant coach at Davidson for three seasons.\n\nIn 1993, Doherty became an assistant coach at Kansas under Roy Williams, who had been an assistant to Smith during Doherty's years at North Carolina. Doherty was at Kansas for seven years. During Doherty's time at Kansas, the Jayhawks won four Big 8 and Big 12 titles and advanced to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament every year. Doherty was an active recruiter during his time at Kansas. Several of the players he coached there went on to play in the NBA, including, but not limited to, Paul Pierce, Drew Gooden, and Kirk Hinrich. Other Kansas players talked about how Doherty recruited them to the press. In an interview with the \"Lawrence Journal-World\", T.J. Pugh mentioned that, on separate occasions, Doherty sent him a single match with the note \"We think you and KU are a perfect match\" as well as an air sickness bag with the note \"We'll be sick if you don't pick Kansas\" written on it. Raef LaFrentz, speaking to \"USA Today\", mentioned Doherty drew him a cartoon called \"Jayhawk Slammer,\" featuring a player dunking over several people.\n\nOn March 30, 1999, Doherty was named as the head coach of Notre Dame men's basketball, less than a month after John MacLeod resigned. At Doherty's Notre Dame press conference, Doherty said his name was mentioned in the press for other coaching jobs, but he never was personally offered these jobs. As a result, Doherty thought it looked like he had turned down several other coaching jobs before the Notre Dame coaching job opened up.\n\nLike every college coach in the nation, Doherty as well as members of his only Notre Dame team, like every college player, had hopes of reaching the 2000 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. But with a regular season record of 16-13 and a quarterfinal loss to Miami in the 2000 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament, Doherty's Notre Dame team did not receive a bid for the NCAA Tournament. Instead, they accepted an invitation to the 2000 National Invitation Tournament. Doherty's Notre Dame team reached the NIT finals, falling to Wake Forest. Doherty's Notre Dame team finished their season with a 22–15 record.\n\nBill Guthridge decided to retire at the end of the 1999-2000 North Carolina basketball season, on June 30, 2000. North Carolina basketball staff interviewed Roy Williams for the head coaching job after Guthridge's retirement. Roy Williams was mistakenly named as head coach by the \"Herald-Sun\" of Durham, North Carolina, before he could decide on the North Carolina coaching job. Roy Williams decided to stay at Kansas. Other coaches, including John Calipari, had interest in the coaching vacancy, but Guthridge and Smith insisted they were looking for a coach with ties to North Carolina's basketball program. George Karl, Larry Brown, Eddie Fogler, Jeff Lebo, and Randy Wiel, all North Carolina basketball alumni, applied for the vacancy. Karl, Brown, and Fogler later took their names out of consideration. Dick Baddour, then the athletic director of UNC-Chapel Hill, was set on hiring Doherty. Doherty was named head coach of North Carolina on July 11, 2000. Doherty decided to take the job after a phone call with Jordan earlier that day. Jordan told Doherty the North Carolina coaching job might go to someone who didn't play or coach at North Carolina.\n\nDoherty asked if he could bring his own staff from Notre Dame with him to North Carolina, a request greenlighted by North Carolina's basketball staff. Doherty brought his assistant coaches--Doug Wojcik, Fred Quartlebaum, and Bob MacKinnon—and his coordinator of basketball operations, David Cason, with him from Notre Dame. Doherty felt he was rewarding the loyalty of the people that worked with him at Notre Dame, and felt Smith would have done the same thing. Instead, Smith and North Carolina basketball staff at that time were upset Doherty replaced Guthridge's assistant coaches Phil Ford, Dave Hanners, and Pat Sullivan. Ford, Hanners, and Sullivan not only played for North Carolina (unlike Doherty's Notre Dame coaching staff), they were also involved in recruiting players prior to Doherty's arrival. Doherty later felt he was misled by North Carolina basketball staff. However, some coaches applauded Doherty for retaining his Notre Dame coaching staff when he became North Carolina's head coach. Doherty also fired some of the front office staff that worked in the basketball office, a moved that shocked North Carolina basketball staffers.\n\nIn July 2000, Doherty gave a speech to his new team. The speech did not go over the way Doherty intended the speech to go; players were confused by Doherty's speech, and Smith, who was still working in the basketball office, elected to check in on Doherty's early practices. Smith continued to call Doherty throughout the season to congratulate Doherty on his wins and to encourage Doherty to relish his wins more often.\n\nDoherty's first public appearance as North Carolina's head coach was at North Carolina's annual Midnight Madness event, then called \"Midnight with Matt and the Tar Heels.\" Doherty received a standing ovation when he walked into Carmichael Auditorium in the team's warm-up clothing and shoes. He participated in some of the event's activities, including a three-point shooting contest and a 3 on 3 contest between the coaching staff and champions from UNC-Chapel Hill's intramural basketball teams.\n\nDoherty's first season began with a game against Winthrop. Doherty called Joseph Forte a \"motherfucking prima donna\" during a timeout after Forte committed a turnover. Doherty also received a technical foul by marching on the court and stomping his feet, in an attempt to get his team's attention. Fans in attendance applauded Doherty's technical foul.\n\nDoherty apologized for a loss against Kentucky. After the Kentucky loss, the Tar Heels went on an 18-game winning streak. During this streak, the Tar Heels won the 2000 Hardee's Tournament of Champions, held in the Charlotte Coliseum. Doherty, not pleased with the first half of the game against UMass, threw a chair in the Tar Heels' locker room at halftime. At a post-game press conference, Doherty said he needed to buy a new chair to replace the one he threw in the locker room.\n\nCurry Kirkpatrick, covering Doherty for his February 12, 2001 column in \"ESPN The Magazine\", included a quote Doherty made in a team huddle during the February 1, 2001 game against Duke in Durham, in which he mused that Duke had \"the ugliest cheerleaders in the ACC.\" Doherty's comment did not spark outrage on Duke University's campus, but Doherty still issued an apology after the article came out.\n\nDoherty received a technical foul during the March 4, 2001 game against Duke in Chapel Hill. Doherty motioned for crowd noise after receiving the technical foul.\n\nDoherty's Tar Heels shared the 2000-01 ACC regular season title with Duke. Doherty was the first men's basketball coach to win a regular season championship title in the ACC in his first season. He was also the first coach to play for, and then coach, teams ranked number one in the AP Poll. After the regular season ended, Doherty was named the Associated Press's National Coach of the Year.\n\nThe Tar Heels made it to the final of the 2001 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament, but lost in the final to Duke. Later, the Tar Heels won an at-large bid to the 2001 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, but were eliminated in the second round by Penn State. They finished their season with a 26–7 record. Michael Brooker, who was a fifth-year senior during Doherty's first year as North Carolina's head coach, blamed a collective feeling of hubris among the players as well as the players not listening to Doherty and his coaching staff for their losses toward the end of the season.\n\nDoherty feared coaching his second season at North Carolina. Several of Doherty's best players from his first season were gone. The combination of the lack of depth and inexperienced freshmen in the back court led to a season that finished 8-20, setting a program-high record of most losses during a season.\n\nAfter Doherty's second season, Adam Boone, a player recruited by Guthridge, transferred away from North Carolina. Boone was the third player to transfer before Doherty's third season. Boone's father felt there was no respect in the basketball program.\n\nThe \"ACC Area Sports Journal\" published an article about Doherty after Boone's transfer. Sources close to the North Carolina basketball program, including then-current and former students, talked to the writer of the article, David Glenn, under anonymity. These sources felt Doherty could be a good coach, but Doherty's approach to his relationships between the players and himself needed to change. One source thought Doherty's coaching style wasn't constructive and his anger at various situations spilled over into his criticisms of players.\n\nJawad Williams and Melvin Scott met with Doherty and the North Carolina coaching staff several times after the season ended. They told the coaching staff players felt uncomfortable talking to them.\n\nDoherty's third season started with the Tar Heels winning the 2002 Preseason NIT, defeating Roy Williams' Kansas in the process. Their five win run was the best start to a season since the 1998–99 season. After a game against Iona, Sean May broke his foot. Several losses, including a five-game losing streak, followed May's injury.\n\nThe regular season ended with North Carolina's first win over Duke since 2001. During the game, held in Chapel Hill, Doherty was involved in an altercation with Chris Collins, then an assistant coach for Duke.\n\nShortly after the regular season ended, the \"ACC Sports Journal\" published another piece by Glenn centered on continuing problems between Doherty and his players. A parent of a player cited in the piece did not trust Doherty and believed other players did not trust Doherty as well. The mother of David Noel told the \"Star-News\" Noel did not have problems with Doherty, but she heard other players were having problems with Doherty.\n\nThe Tar Heels accepted an invitation to the 2003 NIT. They lost in the quarterfinal to Georgetown. The Tar Heels finished their season with 19 wins and a then-second-most program high of 16 losses. (This record has been surpassed by the 17 losses from the 2009-10 season.)\n\nAfter the Georgetown loss, Baddour talked to the players and some parents. The meetings lasted five days. Reporters were stationed near the Smith Center for news about Doherty's future. In the meetings, six players told Baddour they were thinking about transferring. Baddour concluded he had no choice but to remove Doherty from his post.\n\nA press conference was set for the evening of April 1, 2003. Doherty was told he could not return as North Carolina's head basketball coach. North Carolina basketball staff prepared announcements for resignation and a firing, depending on Doherty's decision. North Carolina basketball alumni were skeptical of Baddour's decision to give Doherty two options, but Baddour convinced them Doherty's job prospects and financial situation would look better if Doherty was given the choice to resign. Doherty chose to resign, and his resignation was announced at North Carolina's scheduled press conference. Doherty did not attend the press conference. His contract was bought out for $337,500.\n\nIn an interview with Jones Angell and Adam Lucas for the \"Carolina Insider\" podcast, Steve Kirshner, the senior associate athletic director of UNC Athletics, says he allowed the players to come to the press conference announcing Doherty's resignation. However, Kirshner didn't realize the players that attended the press conference were wearing street clothes until just before the press conference started. Kirshner felt the players’ clothing was misinterpreted in the press, sparking rumors the players had no respect for Doherty and forced him to resign.\n\nThe day after the resignation, \"Inside Carolina\"'s Thad Williamson reported that UNC officials were very concerned about the lack of a respectful environment in the program. In part because of this, three scholarship players had transferred—an unusually high number for any college basketball program, especially for one of UNC's stature. Several more were threatening to leave if Doherty had been allowed to stay on. Doherty had reportedly been given a year to make things more harmonious if he wanted to keep his job.\n\nTwo days after his resignation, Doherty conducted an interview with Jay Bilas for ESPN. In the interview, Doherty stated his resignation was mishandled. Doherty claimed Baddour and his assistants failed to attend any of Doherty's practices. A spokesperson for UNC-Chapel Hill, speaking on behalf of Baddour, denied the claims. Jawad Williams defended Doherty after his resignation; he believed any collegiate basketball coach would have anger issues.\n\nDoherty considered going back to Davidson to become an assistant coach again. Instead, he took the following year off, talking to Brown, Rick Carlisle, Don Nelson, Gregg Popovich, Tom Izzo, and Tommy Amaker about their coaching methods. He went to the Wharton School of Business and wrote a thesis about his professional and personal life. He also took classes at the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration and the Bell Leadership Institute in Chapel Hill. While attending business school, Doherty also wrote a column for \"Sporting News\" and did color commentary for ESPN, College Sports Television, and Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television. He also worked part-time as a scout for the New York Knicks.\n\nIn an interview with ESPN, Rashad McCants claimed Doherty knew about fake classes that kept McCants eligible to play at North Carolina. Doherty denied the accusations on his Twitter account.\n\nDoherty was named head basketball coach of the Florida Atlantic Owls on April 18, 2005, taking over from Sidney Green, who was fired over a month earlier. Doherty was the fifth coach in FAU's history and the last coach to coach while FAU was in the Atlantic Sun Conference.\n\nHurricane Wilma damaged FAU Arena and forced Doherty's Owls team to practice at Bishop Moore High School and the Champions Sport Complex in Orlando, Florida. However, the Owls' season began on time, with a 74–78 loss to Colgate.\n\nA one-hour reality show on Doherty's season with FAU, \"The Season: Florida Atlantic University\", first aired on ESPN2 on January 30, 2006.\n\nIn Doherty's one year at FAU, the Owls achieved their best-ever conference record (14-6) and its third season winning record in school history.\n\nWhile at FAU, Doherty appeared on the ESPNU show \"The U\" as a March Madness analyst.\n\nAfter Jimmy Tubbs was fired for NCAA violations, the athletics department at Southern Methodist University began a search for Tubbs' replacement. The committee chose Doherty because of his recruiting abilities and his concern for his student athletes. Doherty was named head men's basketball coach at SMU on April 24, 2006.\n\nWhile at SMU, Doherty held a lecture on his time as North Carolina's coach at the Cox School of Business, as a case study in business failure. He also assisted in fundraising and planning for Crum Basketball Center, a practice facility for the men's and women's basketball teams. The center opened in February 2008. Before Crum Basketball Center opened, Doherty held his practices in a church gym.\n\nTo generate interest in the basketball program, Doherty went to various fraternities and events on SMU's campus and hosted his weekly radio show at Ten Sports Grill in Downtown Dallas, off SMU's campus. He also started a blog, MustangHoopsBlog.com, which was hosted on SMU's athletics site. The idea to start the blog came from Mark Cuban.\n\nDoherty's first year at SMU had some setbacks. He lost his best player, Bryan Hopkins, to eligibility. He had enough time to sign only one of his prospects, Cameron Spencer. However, later that season, Doherty achieved his one hundredth career victory as a coach with a win against Texas-Pan American. Doherty ended his first season at SMU with a 14-17 overall record and 11-3 non-conference record.\n\nDoherty's fifth season with the Mustangs, in 2010–11, was his most successful season on the court. The Mustangs' 20-15 overall record was the first 20-win season the Mustangs had since 1999–2000. The Mustangs also accepted their first post-season bid in over a decade; they advanced to the semifinals of the 2011 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament. They were defeated in the semifinals by eventual tournament champions Santa Clara.\n\nAfter a 13–19 record set during the 2011–12 season, Doherty was fired from SMU on March 13, 2012. His overall record at SMU was 80-109. None of his SMU teams made it past the first rounds of the Conference USA Men's Basketball Tournament. According to \"The Dallas Morning News\", Doherty received $500,000 for the remaining year left on his contract. Doherty released a statement to the press, acknowledging he was let go because of his overall record at SMU.\n\nDoherty was a scout for the Indiana Pacers. He was hired in October 2012.\n\nIn 2013, Doherty called college basketball games for ESPNU and later appeared on \"Tournament Countdown: The Experts,\" part of ESPNU's post-season college basketball coverage.\n\nOn August 17, 2017, Doherty was hired as the Atlantic 10 Conference's associate commissioner for men's basketball. He resigned in April 2019.\n\nWhile Doherty was coaching at Davidson, he married Kelly Propst, also an alumna of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. They have two children, Tucker (born 1997) and Hattie (born 1999). As of 2019, Tucker is a junior at Bellarmine University where he plays lacrosse and Hattie followed in her parents' footsteps in attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where she is a sophomore and competes in rowing.\n\n"}
{"id": "2115686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2115686", "title": "Per Mertesacker", "text": "Per Mertesacker\n\nPer Mertesacker (; born 29 September 1984) is a German youth football coach and former professional player who is the manager of the Arsenal Academy.\n\nMertesacker began his senior career after being promoted from the youth ranks at Bundesliga club Hannover 96, making his senior league debut as a centre back in November 2003. He was soon dubbed \"the Defence Pole\" (\"\"die Abwehrlatte\"\") by German tabloids, and gained a reputation for his exceptional disciplinary record, going 31 league games without being booked. After various standout performances at Hannover, as well as starring for the Germany national team at the 2006 FIFA World Cup at age 21, he transferred after 74 league matches for \"96\" to fellow Bundesliga outfit Werder Bremen, for a fee of €5 million later that summer. His tenure at the club was characterized for his ability to read play and stifle the build-up play to opposition attacks, establishing himself as a defender with a quiet-but-effective game, and a core-component of the Bremen team that won the 2009 DFB-Pokal, and finished as runner-up in the 2009 UEFA Cup.\n\nAfter being singled out for praise for his performances at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and with his contract at Bremen dwindling, he transferred to Premier League club Arsenal a year later, for a fee of £8 million. At Arsenal, Mertesacker quickly established himself as the first-choice centre back for the club, becoming a mainstay despite sharing several defensive partners over his first two seasons. He eventually built up a solid relationship with fellow defender Laurent Koscielny, and the duo would star as Arsenal ended their nine-year trophy drought by winning the 2014 FA Cup. He would later captain and score for the side in their retention of the trophy a year later, before becoming the club's outright captain in 2016. He would again star in his third victory of the trophy in 2017. However, injuries derailed the latter stages of his career at Arsenal, and was used sparingly during his final two seasons, being forced to retire in 2018.\n\nAt national level, Mertesacker played for Germany at the under-20 and under-21 levels, prior to debuting for the senior side in 2004 against Iran. Upon his debut, Mertesacker established himself as Germany's first-choice centre back for ten years, participating in UEFA European Championship in 2008 and 2012, as well as the 2006, 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, winning the latter. He would retire from international competition following this win.\n\nMertesacker has developed other ventures, including the \"Per Mertesacker Stiftung\", a charitable foundation that helps support amateur sportsmen, and the poor. He would transition into coaching following his retirement, taking charge of the Arsenal Academy.\n\nThe second of three sons, Mertesacker was raised in Pattensen, a small town on the outskirts of the city of Hanover. He began playing football alongside his brothers at the local amateur club TSV Pattensen before joining Hannover 96, where their father was a part-time coach. As a youth player Mertesacker was neither a highly regarded prospect or had any ambitions of being a professional footballer and chose to study for his abitur with the goal of entering tertiary education.\n\nMertesacker joined the youth system of Hannover 96 where he played under his father Stefan, one of the youth coaches, until age 15. While juggling his football commitments and training, he completed his abitur at Carl-Friedrich-Gauß-Schule, a gesamtschule located in nearby Hemmingen noted for its sports program, and subsequently carried out his \"Zivildienst\" at a centre for handicapped people in Hanover. He was promoted to the first team for the 2003–04 season and made his league debut in November 2003, starting against Cologne in the unfamiliar role of right-back. At the time of his debut he was the youngest German-born player in the Bundesliga. However he had a forgettable match and was promptly substituted at half-time by veteran Steve Cherundolo and sent back to the reserve/amateur team. Mertesacker was not seen as an exceptional player at that time and had thought about changing sports. He returned to the first team during the latter half of the season and contributed to Hannover 96's successful battle against relegation. The following season began more auspiciously as he scored his first goal as professional, a last-minute equaliser against Borussia Dortmund in August 2004. Having established himself as first-choice centre back, his strong performances and clean disciplinary record did not go unnoticed by new national team coach Jürgen Klinsmann, who called him up and eventually handed him his senior international debut in October 2004.\n\nThe slender Mertesacker was soon dubbed \"the Defence Pole\" (\"die Abwehrlatte\") by German tabloids and gained a reputation for his good disciplinary record. His first 31 Bundesliga matches ended without a single yellow card, earning him the nickname \"Mr. Clean\". He has only been booked twice during his entire career at Hannover. On 13 May 2006, he played his last game for Hannover 96 and fittingly scored the opening goal in a 2–2 draw against Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nDuring his time at Hannover 96, he became good friends with the late Robert Enke, and along with Michael Ballack, presented the laurel during Enke's memorial service. He later started a temporary account through his foundation (\"Per Mertesacker Stiftung\") to collect donations for Enke's widow.\n\nIn October 2018, Mertesacker returned to Hanover for his charity-cum-testimonial match, which featured his former teammates from Hannover 96 facing off against a \"World XI\" team composed of his former teammates from Arsenal, Werder Bremen and the German national team. Instead of holding his testimonial match in London, where he was based when he retired, he chose Hanover as it was where his career began.\n\nIn August 2006, Mertesacker moved to Werder Bremen in a €5 million transfer deal after a highly impressive performance in the 2006 World Cup, in which Germany finished third. At the time of his transfer, he and Brazilian midfielder Diego, who joined from Porto, were jointly Bremen's most expensive signings in the club's history. Despite missing the first month-and-a-half through an injury sustained at the World Cup, he quickly made the centre-back position his own upon his return to the starting eleven. In November, he scored his debut Champions League goal in a 1–0 win over Chelsea to end the Premier League winners' unbeaten streak in the season's competition. Upon his first return to the AWD-Arena for the first game of the second half of the season, he refused to celebrate after scoring against his boyhood club.\n\nThe 2007–08 season was a mixed bag for Mertesacker. He started in nearly all of Bremen's league and European fixtures and received his first red card in his professional career in a 6–3 loss against VfB Stuttgart. Bremen finished runners-up in the league despite winning only two games fewer than champions Bayern Munich, but they managed to seal a place in next season's Champions League. At the end of the season, he signed a two-year extension to his original contract.\n\nAfter returning from the Euro 2008, Mertesacker again missed the beginning of the new season with a knee injury and through illness. In September, he returned to the starting line-up. He scored the opening goal in the DFB-Pokal semi-final away at northern rivals Hamburger SV to break the deadlock after a goalless first half, but the home side equalised, forcing the match into extra time and Bremen eventually triumphed 4–2 on penalties. He was ever present for the rest of the season until injury forced him off in the UEFA Cup semifinal second leg against Bundesliga rivals Hamburg. It was later revealed that he had torn ligaments in his right ankle and required surgery. He was ruled out for the rest of the season, as well as the UEFA Cup final loss against Shakhtar Donetsk and DFB-Pokal final, which they won. He scored four goals in all competitions, including a crucial equalizer against VfL Wolfsburg.\n\nMertesacker began the 2009–10 season well with a 5–0 win over FC Union Berlin in the 2009–10 DFB-Pokal, the first game of the season. In October, he scored his first goal of the season in a 2–0 win against 1899 Hoffenheim and a last-minute equaliser in the clash against table-toppers Bayer Leverkusen in February. He played 33 Bundesliga matches in total, scoring five goals in the process.\n\nIn the 2010–11 season, Mertesacker made 30 Bundesliga appearances, scoring two goals. He averaged 46.3 passes per game, the third-highest in the Bremen squad, and the second highest pass success rate, with 82%, demonstrating another facet of his game.\n\nOver the course of his final two seasons at Bremen, the Mertesacker received just one yellow card in 63 league matches. He averaged less than one foul per game, cementing his reputation as an astute reader of the game, defying critics' predictions that his height would render him clumsy and having a tendency to frequently concede fouls.\n\nOn 31 August 2011, Arsenal confirmed they had signed Mertesacker on a four-year contract, soon after the club's 8–2 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford. He was presented the number 4 shirt previously worn by former team captain Cesc Fàbregas. In his first month at the club, Mertesacker started in every one of his available league and European matches since his summer move, battling on through the month with various defensive partners as injury problems mounted. \"I want to do a good job, especially in the defence,\" he said. \"That is my role. If the coach praises me then that is a great thing but I have to go on and keep on working.\" In November, he enjoyed a positive month at the heart of the Arsenal defence as he developed his partnership with fellow defender Laurent Koscielny. The Germany international helped the \"Gunners\" to victories against Sunderland, Stoke City and Chelsea – and was outstanding as Arsenal kept a clean sheet in the away victory in Marseille. He remained an integral part of Arsène Wenger's first team, playing in every one of Arsenal's available Premier League fixtures over the next month. He was virtually ever-present over January, missing only the FA Cup victory over Leeds United through illness.\n\nIn February, Mertesacker suffered an ankle injury in the win over Sunderland away at the Stadium of Light and faced a long-term spell on the sidelines. Prior to his injury, he featured in the draw at Bolton Wanderers and the 7–1 victory over Blackburn Rovers at Emirates Stadium. \"Unfortunately he has had surgery and we have lost him for a while,\" said Arsène Wenger. \"How long, I don’t know. He had reconstruction of his ligaments. So it will be long term.\" He had not featured for Arsenal for the remainder of the season, missing the club hitting their highest points tally since 2006.\n\nIn his second season, Mertesacker played in Arsenal's first two matches, helping the team keep clean sheets against Sunderland and Stoke. \"I think we have a better situation than last year,\" he said. \"The team is full of characters, good players and every position [has competition].\" He featured four times in September, forging a fine partnership with Thomas Vermaelen (who replaced Koscielny due to injury) in the process. The German centre back was named man of the match after an excellent performance in a 1–1 draw with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.\nIn October, Mertesacker continued to perform well, making four appearances and helping the club to victories over Norwich City and Queens Park Rangers. Laurent Koscielny praised the German's performances, saying, \"I am happy for Per because he's a nice guy, very important in the dressing room. He's a joker so he’s good for the team. I'm happy because he’s played well this season and it's good for the team.\" Mertesacker was an ever-present throughout November. He scored his first goal for the club in the 5–2 win over Tottenham Hotspur and was voted man of the match for his performance in the 0–0 draw with Aston Villa. \"It was amazing from the very start,\" he told Arsenal after the Tottenham game. \"It was very good to score because we were one man up and they were dropping off. I kept standing in the box and tried to be lucky. The ball from Theo [Walcott] was very good and it was a good day to score.\"\n\nMertesacker made five appearances in December, missing only the trip to Olympiacos in the Champions League and the home win over Newcastle United. On being drawn against Bayern Munich in the Champions League round of 16, he said, \"We will face a good team in Germany. They are top of their league and went through to the knockout stage in a phenomenal way. They only conceded seven goals in the first half of the season. [But] they have a little break now and can rest a bit. Maybe it's a good opportunity for us to face them in February because we will be in our rhythm. We will hopefully go through the Christmas period in a strong way. We can do that.\" Mertesacker captained Arsenal for the first time in the FA Cup win over Brighton & Hove Albion in January, and appeared in every game save for the draw at Southampton on New Year's Day. \"We are always looking to win something and we can achieve something with this group,\" he told Arsenal. \"We have a lively group so our thoughts are now on the next match. That's the most important thing for us, not what's going to happen in May. We have a few targets in our team that are possible this year. We won't talk about it, we'll just see what happens in the next few important weeks on the pitch.\" Mertesacker started four games in February, missing only the FA Cup loss to Blackburn at the Emirates. \"It's always special to face a German team,\" the defender said ahead of the Champions League tie against Bayern. \"[Me and Lukas Podolski] are looking forward to it because Bayern are a great team and are so consistent this year. It's a special game for German players to play against a team from their home country.\"\n\nMertesacker was a mainstay in March, playing every single minute of Arsenal's four games. The centre back was on target in the defeat at Tottenham and was a key component in the defence that kept clean sheets against both Bayern Munich and Swansea City. \"It rained cats and dogs, especially in the second half,\" he said after the win in south Wales, in Swansea. \"It was very slippery but it was a vital win.\" In April, Mertesacker was shown a red card at West Bromwich Albion in the first game of the month. The defender returned to the team after suspension and was named man of the match against Fulham after scoring the only goal away at Craven Cottage. \"I think they've been terrific – not only defending very well but also creating goals for us at the other end like they did last week against Fulham,\" said goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny on the partnership between Mertesacker and Koscielny. \"They're getting the credit they deserve because they work very hard and they're very honest lads. I'm very happy for them and it's much easier to play behind them when they are in that kind of form.\"\n\nMertesacker impressed at the back alongside Koscielny in May. The German defender was given the captain's armband in Arsenal's last game of the season when Mikel Arteta went off injured. \"I think it is good for us to play against teams who are under pressure,\" he said after the win against Queens Park Rangers [who were on the brink of relegation]. \"It helps us keep our focus on a high level.\"\n\nMertesacker was named as the temporary captain of the side after injuries to Thomas Vermaelen and Mikel Arteta at the beginning of the 2013–14 season. He scored his first goal of the season against Stoke following a free-kick from compatriot Mesut Özil. After his man of the match performance away to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League helped Arsenal to a 1–0 win, Mertesacker's influence was cited as a significant factor in Arsenal's excellent start to the 2013–14 season, which saw the team leading the Premier League at the end of November. As Mertesacker's great run continued, he was voted as a part of the Premier League Team of the Year, along with teammate Aaron Ramsey. On 13 January 2014, Mertesacker made his 100th official appearance for the \"Gunners\" in a 1–2 away win over Aston Villa. On 4 March 2014, Mertesacker signed a new contract with Arsenal.\n\nOn 12 April 2014, Mertesacker scored an 82nd-minute equalising goal for Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final against Wigan Athletic. The match finished 1–1 after extra time, with Arsenal winning 4–2 in a penalty shootout. He had earlier conceded the penalty that had put Wigan 1–0 up. On 17 May 2014, Mertesacker started in the 2014 FA Cup Final as Arsenal beat Hull City 3–2 at Wembley Stadium.\n\nAfter initially featuring sparingly due to injuries in the 2014–15, he returned to captain Arsenal in the 2015 FA Cup Final at Wembley in a 4–0 victory over Aston Villa. He scoring the third goal, a header, during the second half.\n\nAfter healing from injury, Mertesacker remained a mainstay in the Arsenal backline, playing alongside Laurent Koscielny. With Arsenal making a charge towards the title, Arsène Wenger singled out Mertesacker for praise, calling him an \"important leader in the dressing room and a respected one\". On 24 January 2016, in a match against London rivals Chelsea, Mertesacker was sent off after 18 minutes for a late tackle on Diego Costa, who later scored the only goal of the game at Emirates.\n\nHowever, he would sustain an injury against Lens in the 2016–17 pre-season, undergoing knee surgery in his native Germany later that month. Following a clash between Arsenal and Viking, Arsène Wenger confirmed that Mertesacker would be absent until December. Despite the injury he was named club captain following the retirement of Mikel Arteta. He was a second-half substitute on the last day against Everton. On 27 May 2017, Mertesacker made his only start of the season, in the FA Cup final against Chelsea, which Arsenal won 2–1. He made a number of important tackles during the match and his performance was praised by opposition manager Antonio Conte, who stated that Mertesacker was a \"perfect example for any young professional football player,\" adding that \"what he did today was just a consequence of an unbelievable attitude every day.\"\n\nArsenal would later confirm the 2017–18 season would be Mertesacker's last, before becoming the head of the club's academy the following year. On 7 January 2018, Per Mertesacker captained the Arsenal team in an FA Cup game away against Nottingham Forest and scored a goal to make the score 1–1, with the game eventually finishing 4–2 to Forest, before featuring in his last ever game for the club in a win against Burnley on 6 May 2018.\n\nIn September 2004, Jürgen Klinsmann, then-manager of Germany, called Mertesacker up for 9 October 2004 game against Iran. He made his debut less than two weeks after his 20th birthday when he came on as a second-half substitute for Christian Wörns.\nWith his quiet but effective game, he established himself as Germany's first-choice centre back, pairing up with Robert Huth, Christoph Metzelder and later Heiko Westermann. At the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup hosted on home soil, he played the full 90 minutes in all five games and scored his first international goal in a group stage match against Australia as Germany finished in third place.\n\nAt the 2006 World Cup on home soil, Mertesacker paired with Metzelder in central defence. After Germany won the quarter-final penalty shoot-out against Argentina, Mertesacker suffered minor injuries to his thigh and a kick to the groin when he was attacked after the final whistle by Argentine unused substitute Leandro Cufré; Cufré was later fined and suspended four matches. After Germany's loss to Italy in the semi-finals, Mertesacker had surgery on one of his legs and left testicle (not related to the attack above, but an injury he had been dealing with during previous matches) and missed the third place play-off. Nevertheless, his impressive showing did earn him a transfer to Bundesliga team Werder Bremen after the tournament.\n\nMertesacker was first-choice when fit during 2008 European Championship qualification and was ever present in the final tournament itself. Due to injury problems at the beginning of the 2009–10 season, he missed several 2010 World Cup qualifiers but later retained his place as first choice. Mertesacker regularly wears the number 17 jersey.\n\nMertesacker was called up for the 2012 European Championship but spent the whole tournament on the bench as an unused substitute due to the emergence of youngsters Mats Hummels and Holger Badstuber. He broke his seven-year goal drought for the national team when he scored his second international goal for Germany on 17 October 2012, in a 2014 World Cup qualifier against Sweden. On 13 September 2013, he scored his third goal for Germany against the Faroe Islands. On 19 November 2013, Mertesacker captained the side and also scored the winning goal as Germany beat England 1–0 at Wembley Stadium in a friendly match to mark the 150th anniversary of The Football Association.\n\nDuring the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign, Mertesacker contributed two goals and also re-established himself as first-choice centre back following a long-term injury to Badstuber in the middle of the 2011–12 season, often partnering either Hummels or Jerome Boateng. He was called up for the final World Cup squad and played in all but one of the matches during Germany's successful run to the final, as well as reaching his 100th cap during the group stage match against Ghana. On 15 August 2014, Mertesacker announced his retirement from international football.\n\nDuring the 2014 World Cup Mertesacker became an internet sensation after a video of his live post-match interview was uploaded on YouTube and went viral, amassing over 28 million views as of June 2015. After the narrow extra-time win over Algeria in the 2014 World Cup round of 16 Mertesacker, who was visibly exhausted and reportedly already in a foul mood, was taken aside to conduct an impromptu interview with ZDF reporter Boris Büchler and subsequently questioned about the German defensive line's \"cumbersome and vulnerable\" performance against their opponents. He defended his teammates before brusquely retorting, \"What do want from me? [...] I'll lie down in the ice bath for three days and then we'll analyze the game in peace.\", leading the interview to be dubbed the \"Ice Bath Interview\" (\"Eistonnen-Interview\") by the German press and amused fans. Despite the uncharacteristic outburst, Mertesacker, being a popular figure with fans, was widely praised by viewers and applauded by his teammates for candidness; Büchler himself was also praised for not being afraid to ask \"tough questions\" and he later clarified that he and Mertesacker were actually on friendly terms. Several days later Mertesacker uploaded a picture of himself in an ice bath on his Twitter account as a tongue-in-cheek response. German magazine \"11 Freunde\" created and uploaded a mash-up video of Mertesacker's interview with Vanilla Ice's Ice Ice Baby on its website while German comedian Oliver Pocher and 1. FC Köln players parodied the interview. Journalist Raphael Honigstein and national team manager Oliver Bierhoff both retrospectively noted that the infamous interview was a turning point for the squad psychologically.\n\nMertesacker was announced as the new Arsenal Academy manager prior to the 2017–18 season, officially assuming the position in July 2018. He launched a coaching programme as part of the club's partnership with Save the Children in the Zaatari refugee camp to provide football pitches and training for coaches specifically in the area of detecting PTSD symptoms. After Unai Emery's sacking in late November 2019, Mertesacker took the role as interim assistant manager to support interim head coach Freddie Ljungberg for the meantime.\n\nHe also works as a pundit for DAZN Germany covering the Champions League.\n\nAt , Mertesacker is commanding in the air but he is also sound in defending on the ground. He often uses his strength to shrug opponents off the ball and his standing tackling ability to win balls. Despite being criticised by pundits for his lack of pace, he compensates with his excellent positional play and astute reading of the game. As a result, he is able to make clean interceptions and clearances, hence his reputation as a defender who rarely concedes reckless fouls or gets booked.\n\nMertesacker possesses solid technique, is a good defensive organizer, and a neat distributor of the ball. He averaged 46.3 passes per game in 2010–11 season, the third highest in the Werder Bremen squad, and the second-highest pass success rate, at 82%. In the 2012–13 season with Arsenal, he averaged 50.1 passes per game with a 91.5% success rate, fourth-highest in the league. Often, Mertesacker is paired with a more mobile and quicker defender who can track-back in a counterattack situation, such as Mats Hummels and Arne Friedrich for Germany or Laurent Koscielny at Arsenal.\n\nMertesacker met his future wife German international handballer Ulrike Stange in 2008 while both were recovering from injury at a rehab clinic in Donaustauf and began a relationship not long after. They married in June 2013 and have two sons (born April 2011 and May 2014). Mertesacker is a Protestant Christian.\n\nIn an interview with German newspaper \"Der Spiegel\" published in March 2018, Mertesacker admitted to suffering from anxiety attacks throughout his career due to the \"inhumane pressure\" to perform, but had continued on due to his love for the sport and the desire to win silverware, and expressed his relief that he would no longer have to experience it anymore as he was retiring. The well-publicised interview drew criticism from some current and former players but he was generally praised by many others, including professional sports psychologists and his former teammates, for his candidness and courage in broaching a sensitive topic and addressing the perception that footballers were \"perfect\". It reignited debate within Germany about the psychological welfare and well-being of professional footballers and elite athletes.\n\nIn November 2006, Mertesacker established the \"Per Mertesacker Foundation\", initially to support the family of his former Hannover and Germany late teammate Robert Enke, who had just lost his young daughter several months prior. After Enke's suicide it began focusing on providing support for those suffering from depression and has since expanded to include disadvantaged and marginalized children, particularly those from immigrant backgrounds, in his native Hanover. Since 2007, the foundation has organised yearly charity football matches which have featured Mertesacker's national and club teammates Philipp Lahm, Lukas Podolski and Tomáš Rosický, as well as comedian Oliver Pocher, Fury in the Slaughterhouse member Rainer Schumann and German ice hockey legend Uwe Krupp. T-shirts and sweatshirts bearing the words \"Big Fucking German\" – the Arsenal fans' chant for him and a play on the Roald Dahl novel \"The BFG\" – are among items sold to raise money for the foundation.\n\nMertesacker co-owns the Hanover-based real estate agency CP Immobilien GmbH with his Werder Bremen and national teammate Clemens Fritz. The duo started the business venture in 2012 while planning for their retirement.\n\nWerder Bremen\n\nArsenal\n\n\nGermany\n\nIndividual\n\n\n"}

She was best known for being one of Pablo Picasso's last lovers during the 1950s. In 2005 she auctioned off 20 of Picasso's works which had been given to her, many of them portraits of her.\n\nLaporte was born in Paris.\n\nReportedly she met Picasso as a teenager during World War II, finding common ground in poetry. She was in her mid-twenties when the affair began in 1951, although Picasso was nearly 50 years older than she was and had recently fathered two children with Françoise Gilot. Some art historians and museums carrying Picasso's work have dubbed the paintings he made around that time the \"Genevieve Period\", as many of them feature symbolic tributes to his model and muse as well as dedications \"To Genevieve\". Picasso wanted Laporte to move in with him after Gilot left him in 1953, but she refused — which, she was told by Jean Cocteau, \"saved her skin\". In 1959 she married a fellow Parisian resistance fighter instead.\n\nShe was perhaps most famous for auctioning off 20 works, many with her as a subject, which were bestowed upon her during the secret love affair with Picasso in the 1950s. The auction occurred in June 2005. With the money earned from the auction she created a foundation \"Genevieve Laporte de Pierrebourg, pour la defense de la nature et des animaux\", with agreement of the Fondation de France.\n\nShe made 18 documentary films in Africa, and the Académie française awarded her a prize in 1999 for a volume of poetry.

The song was sent to radio stations worldwide on January 1, 2000. It was their first release anywhere for over 14 months due to the time spent touring the world, resting and recording the second album.\n\nAlthough a commercial success, \"Cartoon Heroes\" failed to follow the success of earlier songs such as \"Barbie Girl\" and \"Doctor Jones\". In Denmark, the song debuted at number one and went on to become the best-selling single of 2000, with sales of 32,765 copies. It also topped the charts of Italy, Norway and Spain and reached the top ten in at least nine other countries, including Belgium, Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It also found success in Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland.\n\nThe music video for this song was filmed in December 1999. It starts with an American newscaster reporting on broadcast that a one-eyed sea monster attacks the world prompting an SOS call for Aqua in space. The quartet wakes up in zero gravity and Søren pushes up the gravity lever. They put on their hero suits and prepare to drive their spaceship to planet Earth where the sea monster is deep in the ocean. The quartet then puts on their diving suits and they fight the sea monster they seek.

It is associated with the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne and is a member of the Association of Coeducational Schools (ACS) and the Junior School Heads Association of Australia.\n\nThe school provides a education from kindergarten to the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE). All Year 12 students study for the VCE as the VCAL and IB Diploma Programme are not offered.\n\nIn 1870, Mother Emily Ayckbowm founded a new Anglican religious order in England - the Community of the Sisters of the Church. The order had been invited to Australia to further educational work for girls and St Michael's was one of six schools established in different parts of Australia. They also founded schools in England, New Zealand and Canada. On 23 April 1895, the sisters opened St Michael's in a converted 1870s mansion.\n\nIn 1972, the sisters transferred the management of St Michael's to a school council and the school was incorporated. In the early 1980s the school was close to bankruptcy. With the appointment of a new headmaster, Anthony Hewison, the decision was taken to admit boys to all levels of the school, thus making it fully coeducational, and to embark on modernising the school.\n\nIn 1985 the school became a company limited by guarantee. Since that date the sisters have retained their interest in the school but no longer play a part in its governance. The school is managed by a head who is appointed by a board of directors.\n\nWith the arrival of headmaster Simon Gipson, the administration adopted new approaches. The changes related to:\n\nOn 6 December 2007, St Michael's purchased The Astor Theatre building in St Kilda. The cinema continued to operate as usual, with films screening at nights and on weekends, while the building was often used by the school for assemblies and events on weekdays. On 24 August 2012 the school announced that it had sold the building to Ralph Taranto.\n\nSt Michael's offers a wide range of subjects including core mathematics, science, English, IT, LOTEs (Languages Other Than English), arts and humanities courses. At primary level, all students study basic subjects including mathematics, English, science, geography, history, Japanese, music and sport. A major focus of the school is drama.\n\nDrama has one of the highest voluntary participation numbers among students of any department of the school. St Michael's is well-known for its drama program. Each year the school performs a large number of productions, including Years 10 to 12 senior musical; the Years 7 to 9 musical and play; Dance Fusion (a contemporary dance production); a student production; a house drama festival and three yearly senior plays. In 2001, St Michael's was the first school to stage a production at Melbourne’s Athenaeum Theatre with the performance of \"Les Misérables\". The 2010 senior musical, \"13\", was the Australian premiere of the musical and won the best production award at the Victorian Musical Theatre Guild awards (the fourth St Michael's musical to do so). The senior musical in 2011 was \"Parade\".\n\nSt Michael's also conducts an annual compulsory house singing competition, in which all five of the school houses perform a musical item. Many other musical ensembles perform regularly throughout the year, including the 7-12 Harrison Choir, which each year performs a large choral work, and the Grigoryan Orchestra (named for school alumnus, guitarist Slava Grigoryan).\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef project involves year 10 students studying VCE Unit 2 biology in Far North Queensland, participating in a month of research on the Great Barrier Reef. Activities include daily snorkeling from St Michael's Orpheus Island Research Campus.\n\nOriginally the program ran for a duration of one month, but has since been extended to include days in Townsville, Paluma and Tully to study Indigenous culture.\n\nWhen St Michael's student body was much smaller, the entire senior school went on school camp together; this was the first \"Exodus\".\"Exodus\" camps have for many years been split between year and house groups for students in Years 7 to 11. Each student from Year 7 to Year 11 experiences a minimum of five days of outdoor education each year, with the programs run by the Outdoor Education Group. Junior school programs mainly involve staying in cabins (although part of the Year 6 Exodus involves sleeping in tents) and participating in various activities.\n\nSenior school programs are quite diverse, ranging from bush walking in Year 7 to choices including rafting, kayaking, rock-climbing, tree-planting or cycling in year 11. Year 10 students may also have great choice in their Exoduses, including Hattah Solo, a popular program involving students spending 24 hours out of the week-long program alone (albeit in close proximity to other students and supervisors) for the purposes of reflection and learning self-sufficiency. Exodus for each year level is slightly more challenging than the last, and there is a different theme for each year level.\n\nEvery year students in year 11 have the option to take part in the Kosciuszko to the Coast program in lieu of the year 11 Exodus (School camp). This is a challenging 20-day expedition where students travel (through various methods including snowshoeing, hiking, white-water rafting and canoeing) from Mount Kosciuszko to the coast of Victoria, camping along the way.\n\nThe European Touring Choir consists of boys and girls in Years 8-12. The group travels biannually to Europe to compete in international choir competitions and perform on world stagesy. Past tours have travelled to Rome, Carrara, Pisa, Venice, Vicenza, Nördlingen, Reykjavík, Copenhagen, Berlin, Leipzig, Hagen, Cologne, Voorburg, Amsterdam, Paris, London, Florence, York, Croissy, Munich and Vienna, including performeances at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and the Llangollen International Eisteddfod in Wales.\n\nSt Michael's has student exchange programs with schools in Japan and France.\n\nThe Japanese exchange with Keio Shonan-Fujisawa Junior & Senior High School in Fujisawa, Kanagawa Prefecture has been operating for over 10 years.\n\nThe French exchange began in 1999 and takes place every two years, with \"Le Bon Sauveur\" in Paris. The St Michael's students usually go to France for five to six weeks during their summer holiday (December–January). The return trip to Australia by the students of \"Le Bon Sauveur\" usually happens in July–August of the following year.\n\nSt Michael's has an admissions and community engagement team whose responsibilities include raising awareness of the school, processing and monitoring student applications (local and international) and enriching educational programs by supporting community engagement and contributing citizenship programs.\n\nThe school is involved in social service, working to raise money for various charities. Once or twice a term a \"Community Action Day\" (previously called \"Casual Clothes Day\") is held, organised by the social service captains of each house, to raise money for a diverse number of charities, ranging from the Asylum Seekers Resource Centre (Sarum House) to a sponsor village in Bali (Mitre House). Every year in May, a prefect-organised program, entitled the \"Merry Month of May\", is held to raise money for social service. Activities such as a \"Battle of the Bands\", barbecues, dress-up days, movie viewings, novelty races, great debates and theatresport contests are held each day. Also in conjunction with the Merry Month of May, the school participates in the \"World's Greatest Shave\" for the Leukaemia Foundation, in which participants shave their heads to show solidarity for leukaemia sufferers, raising money through collecting donations. In 2016, the Merry Month of May raised a record sum of $30,678. The school leadership teams in both the senior and junior schools in 2011 also raised money for relief for the Christchurch earthquake, Japanese tsunami and subsequent nuclear disaster and the bushfires in Victoria and Queensland.\n\nThe junior school houses (Years K-6) are Moss, Woods, Marlton and Cintra.\n\nThe senior school houses (Years 7-12) are Mitre, Sarum, Hughes, Kilburn and Breen. Mitre, Sarum, Hughes and Kilburn are the four original school houses and were all created in 1922, all significant for their own reasons. When the school started to grow a fifth senior school house, Breen was created in 1987. The pastoral care system is based on a house structure which deals with all matters relating to a student's wellbeing or curriculum needs. Each student is placed in a house tutorial group which is overseen by a house tutor. There are five houses and therefore five house tutorial groups at each year level. A house contains students from Years 7 to 12. Each house is led by two co-heads. The members of each house are led by co-house captains and co-vice-captains. The houses meet on a regular basis.\n\nThe house tutor and heads of house work as a team to monitor the academic and personal progress of each student in the house tutorial group and house. Generally, the house tutor is the first and main point of contact between the parent and the school.\n\nThe following individuals have served as the school principal:\nThe following individuals have served as the head of the school or any previous title:\n\n\n"}

They travelled eastwards through Europe and Asia, flew to Alaska, and continued on by road to New York. The series aired on Sky 1 from 18 October 2004 – 1 February 2005 and was repeated on BBC Two in 2008.\n\nFrom 14 April 2004 to 29 July 2004, Ewan McGregor, Charley Boorman, motorcycle riding cameraman Claudio von Planta, along with director/producers David Alexanian and Russ Malkin, travelled from London to New York City via Western and Central Europe, Ukraine, Western Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Siberia and Canada, over a cumulative distance of . The only sections not undertaken by motorcycle were the passage through the Channel Tunnel, by train in Siberia to circumvent the Zilov Gap, several river crossings and a short impassable section in eastern Russia undertaken by truck, and a flight from Magadan in eastern Russia to Anchorage, Alaska in the US.\n\nThe riders took their BMW motorcycles through deep and swollen rivers, many without functioning bridges, while travelling along the Road of Bones to Magadan. The summer runoff from the icemelt was in full flow and the bikes eventually had to be loaded onto passing trucks to be ferried across a few of the deepest rivers.\n\nThe journey passed through twelve countries, starting in the UK, then through France, Belgium, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Canada, and the US, ending in New York City.\n\nThe team stayed mainly in hotels while in Europe, North America, and the more populated parts of Russia, but frequently had to camp out in Kazakhstan and Mongolia. They visited various sights and landmarks en route, including the Church of Bones in the Czech Republic, the Mask of Sorrow monument (described as the \"Mask of Grief\" in the show) in Magadan, and Mount Rushmore in the USA. They arrived in New York on schedule, and rode into the city accompanied by a phalanx of bikers including McGregor's father Jim and the Orange County Choppers crew.\n\nIn addition to McGregor, Boorman, and von Planta, the team had a support crew of producers David Alexanian and Russ Malkin, and cinematographer Jimmy Simak. For the journey through Asia, they were also accompanied by security advisor Sergey and doctor Vasily. The crew travelled in two Mitsubishi off-road vehicles – a red L200 Animal LWB 4x4 pick-up (which overturned in Mongolia, and was exchanged for a Ford Excursion in Alaska) and a black Shogun Warrior DI-D automatic estate. Additional vehicles such as a Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant 4x4 van were also used by the support crew during the Russian/East Asia segment. The vehicles generally followed about a day behind the bikers, meeting them at border crossings and when circumstances required a greater degree of teamwork.\n\nBefore setting off from London, McGregor and Boorman received specialist training to prepare for the expedition. Operating within hostile and dangerous environments (such as unauthorised checkpoints) was covered by ex-SAS Major Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton. Training also covered off-road riding, the Russian language, and motorbike maintenance. They took advice from experts and embassy officials about the more remote countries they were to visit. During the first aid training, McGregor decided they would take a doctor with them on the Siberian part of the trip, where they would be far from medical help.\n\nResearchers, dubbed \"Ewan and Charley's Angels\", helped get the team on the road and acquire all the necessary paperwork and visas.\n\nMcGregor advocated riding BMW motorcycles, while Boorman preferred KTM (a specialist Austrian motocross and off-road bike manufacturer). They had also considered Honda. After off-road tests on KTM and BMW machines, McGregor agreed to go for KTMs, but KTM ultimately declined to provide them with promotional bikes out of concern that the team might fail.\n\nBMW then contributed three BMW R1150GS all-terrain motorcycles, which were modified to help the team achieve and document their mission. They were also equipped with cameras, microphones and display/viewfinder screens mounted on the dashboards. A customised GPS with specially mapped waypoints in Mongolia and Siberia was crucial in areas with no roads or signposts.\n\nWhen the team crossed from the Czech Republic into Slovakia, they realised that they hadn't received a stamp on their carnet (a document that ensures expensive items brought into a country are not sold) when entering the Czech Republic. This could have led to the seizure of their cameras, but a bribe was paid and the team allowed to continue. A similar problem occurred when crossing into Ukraine: border officials insisted on seeing original copies of the vehicle registration certificates, while the team only had photocopies. After waiting around twelve hours, the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs contacted the checkpoint and insisted that the team be let through.\n\nThe police in Kazakhstan often insisted on escorting them through the country. The journey became a local news story and the police would bring them to impromptu welcoming parties, usually featuring a television news crew and offerings of fermented milk. The team grew tired of these unscheduled events and eventually insisted they be allowed to travel alone. After an incident when a passenger in a passing car pointed a handgun at them on a deserted stretch of highway, the team realised the value of police protection and were glad to see the authorities when they reached the next town.\n\nThe on-board cameras used by McGregor and Boorman were designed specifically for the trip by Sonic Communications, in consultation with the team. Each rider controlled two cameras, including one built into their helmets to provide a panoramic forward view. The second was removable to allow McGregor and Boorman to hold them, and to prevent theft or damage when the bikes were left unattended. They could see what they were filming on a small monitor attached to the handlebars. Von Planta and Jimmy Simak both carried more sophisticated camera equipment capture story, scenery and action shots of the two principal stars.\n\nThe journey was also used to promote the humanitarian efforts of UNICEF, and the team took time to visit and film some of its work. The projects visited were an orphanage in Ukraine housing children affected by the Chernobyl disaster, a climbing wall at a youth centre in Kazakhstan, and an outreach project working with street children living in the heating systems of apartment blocks in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.\n\nEwan McGregor had petrol sprayed into his (recently laser-corrected) eyes at filling stations on two occasions, one of which required a trip to an optometrist in Ukraine. In the first case, Boorman attempted to stop a petrol pump by putting his finger over the nozzle, only to send a jet of fuel directly into McGregor's face; in the second, petrol gushed out of McGregor's own bike's tank while filling.\n\nMcGregor's forehead became badly swollen around a mosquito bite in Kazakhstan, which required treatment. McGregor also showed his badly bitten rear and revealed that his penis had become swollen and painful during the trip, again due to mosquito bites. \n\nRuss Malkin and Vassili the doctor rolled their off-roader in Mongolia, but escaped with minor injuries. Boorman badly strained his left shoulder in Siberia, and was unable to ride for several days (mostly while they were riding on local trucks or with their support crew). McGregor was struck by a very young driver outside Calgary and was lucky that his panniers took the brunt of what could have been a very serious incident. The following day Boorman was bumped while stationary by a driver who reversed into him at slow speed but without causing injury or major damage. Cameraman Claudio von Planta had an opportunist thief steal his tent and personal effects whilst left unattended in Siberia. Boorman also had his wallet stolen from his jeans at some natural hot springs in Canada, losing $500 and €400 along with his credit cards.\n\nVon Planta's bike suffered a broken frame after a bad fall in Mongolia, and only a \"bodge job\" by Boorman using tyre levers and cable-ties enabled them to get to the next town where it could be welded. Afterwards, they realized that the anti-lock braking system no longer worked (due to the battery not being disconnected prior to the electric arc welder being used to repair the frame) and the entire bike had to be shipped to Ulaanbaatar and sent home. A replacement was found locally (nicknamed 'The Red Devil'), a new Russian-made IZh Planeta 5, purchased for about US$1,000. This later developed gearbox problems. Two passing Mongolian sheep herders were able quickly to repair it, laughing that McGregor and Boorman had such high-quality tools but little idea how to fix the bike. The next part of the route was especially wet and muddy, making the heavy BMW bikes undrivable and forcing McGregor and Boorman to man-handle them for long distances, whilst von Planta on the much lighter Planeta had no trouble riding. The frame of McGregor's bike broke in two places in Siberia, forcing them to flag down a passing truck that took them back to Tynda for more welding.\n\nOne of McGregor's greatest fears was drawing water into his engine, which affected his bike twice while crossing Siberian rivers. He pumped out water from the engine and exhaust, and the bike restarted. The bikes also sustained problems after being incorrectly stowed during the flight from Magadan, which required a full service when they arrived in Alaska. Boorman's bike suffered the only serious puncture of the trip. Boorman also broke a spoke on his rear wheel, which was replaced by The Motorcycle Shop in Anchorage. All of the motorcycles also suffered bumps, scrapes and cracks although, except for von Planta's BMW, they survived the journey.\n\nThe music in \"Long Way Round\" was picked by McGregor and Boorman, and includes tracks from Stereophonics, Blur, Coldplay, Orbital, Massive Attack, and Radiohead. The theme song was written and performed by Kelly Jones, the lead singer of Stereophonics. McGregor and Jones had discussed ideas for the song by text message during the trip.\n\nA two-disc DVD was released as a mini-series late in 2005, consisting of seven episodes of about 45 minutes each, totalling around 400 minutes. The episodes are unnamed, but cover roughly the following:\n\n\nThe accompanying bonus disc contains several short features and deleted scenes.\n\nA special edition DVD was released, extending the series to ten episodes of about 45 minutes over three discs (and without the original bonus disc), totalling around 540 minutes. Differences between the two versions are notably at the beginning (the original covers their preparation with one episode rather than two), and at the end (the original shows their trip from Anchorage through Canada to New York in one episode rather than two). The special edition also dedicates an episode to retrospective interviews one year later. The special edition's episodes are unnamed, but cover roughly the following:\n\n\nThe music selection is also slightly different between the two versions.\n\nMcGregor, Boorman and the LWR team undertook a second journey known as \"Long Way Down\", riding from John o' Groats in northern Scotland to Cape Town, South Africa in 2007. As with \"Long Way Round\", visiting and raising awareness for UNICEF projects was an important part of the journey. Boorman competed in the 2006 Dakar Rally, which was filmed and broadcast in various countries as \"Race to Dakar\". Boorman has also undertaken trips from Ireland to Sydney (\"By Any Means\") and from Sydney to Tokyo (\"\").\n\nMcGregor and Boorman were inspired by motorcyclist Ted Simon's book \"Jupiter's Travels\". They met with Simon in Mongolia.\n\n\n\n"}

It was the second single released from her debut studio album, \"She's So Unusual\" (1983), with Hyman contributing backing vocals. The track was produced by Rick Chertoff and released as a single on January 27, 1984. The song became Lauper's first number 1 hit in the U.S. The song was written in the album's final stages, after \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\", \"She Bop\" and \"All Through the Night\" had been written. The writing began with the title, which Lauper had seen in \"TV Guide\" magazine, referring to the science fiction film \"Time After Time\" (1979).\n\n\"Time After Time\" is composed of simple keyboard-synth chords, bright, jangly guitars, clock-ticking percussion, and elastic bassline. Lyrically, it is a love song of devotion. Music critics gave the song positive reviews, with many commending the song for being a solid and memorable love song. The song has been selected as one of the Best Love Songs of All Time by many media outlets, including \"Rolling Stone\", Nerve, MTV and many others. \"Time After Time\" was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Song of the Year at the 1985 edition. The song was a success on the charts, becoming her first number-one single on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart on June 9, 1984, and remaining there for two weeks. The song reached number three on the UK Singles Chart and number six on the ARIA Singles Chart.\n\nWhile writing for her debut studio album, in the spring of 1983, Cyndi Lauper was introduced to American musician Rob Hyman (founding member of The Hooters), who was recommended by Rick Chertoff, the album's producer. Lauper had already recorded the majority of the album, including the songs \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\", \"She Bop\" and \"All Through the Night\", but Chertoff insisted that she and Hyman needed to record just \"one more song\". Therefore, she and Hyman sat at a piano and started working on \"Time After Time\". The inspiration for the song came after both songwriters were going through similar situations in their respective relationships; he was coming out of a relationship, while she was having difficulties with her boyfriend, David Wolff. One of the first lines Rob wrote was \"suitcase of memories\", which according to Lauper, \"struck her\", claiming it was a \"wonderful line\", while other lines came from Lauper's life. The song's title was borrowed from a TV Guide listing for the 1979 movie \"Time After Time\", which Lauper intended to use a temporary placeholder during the writing process. Although Lauper later tried to change the title, she said \"Time After Time\" became so important the song would fall apart with a different title.\n\nInitially, Epic Records wanted \"Time After Time\" as the album's lead single. However, Lauper felt that releasing a ballad first defines an artist in a certain way, noting that she could have been known as a balladeer and that it could have killed her career. Her manager Dave Wolff was convinced that \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\" could be an anthem, and ultimately her label agreed and released it as the lead single. \"Time After Time\" eventually became the album's second single, being released on January 27, 1984.\n\nWritten by Cyndi Lauper and Rob Hyman and produced by Rick Chertoff, \"Time After Time\" is built over simple keyboard-synth chords, bright, jangly guitars, clock ticking percussion, and elastic bassline. Lyrically, the track is a love song of devotion. Pam Avoledo of \"Blogcritics\" speculates that, \"In 'Time After Time,' Lauper believes she is a difficult person, unworthy of love. She runs away and shuts people out. However, her devoted boyfriend who loves her unconditionally is willing to help her through anything. The relationship is given depth. The couple’s intimacy and history is apparent. They've been together for a long time. They love and have seen each other through every tough part of their life.\"\n\n\"Time After Time\" is written in the key of C major with a tempo of 130 beats per minute in common time. Lauper's vocals span from G to C in the song.\n\nThe song received critical acclaim: \n\n\"Time After Time\" has entered many lists of \"Best Love Songs of All Time\", \"Best Ballads from the 80's\" and others. Bill Lamb, also from \"About.com\", placed the song at number 21 on his \"Top 100 Best Love Songs Of All Time\" list. On \"Nerve\"'s list of \"The 50 Greatest Love Songs of All Time\", \"Time After Time\" was placed at number 5, being called \"Lauper's most enduring masterpiece hits at the very essence of commitment,\" with the article pointing out that \"she captures real romance in the most simple and straightforward of lines: 'If you're lost, you can look and you will find me, time after time'.\"\n\nThe song also entered the Rolling Stone & MTV's \"100 Greatest Pop Songs\" at number 66. The song also entered VH1's \"100 Best Songs of the Past 25 Years and \"100 Greatest Songs of the 80s\" lists, at numbers 22 and 19 respectively. The song was also present on NME's 100 Best Songs of the 1980s, being ranked at number 79. The website declared that \"‘Time After Time’ was a change in tack for Lauper, whose musical persona had previously been unstoppably light and frothy. ‘Time After Time’ was demoed quickly in time for inclusion on her debut ‘She’s So Unusual’, and ended up being a key song for both Lauper’s career and the decade itself.\"\n\n\n\"Time After Time\" became Lauper's first number-one single on the Billboard charts, reaching the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in June 1984. It also reached the top of the Adult Contemporary and Canadian Singles Chart. In the United Kingdom, \"Time After Time\" first peaked at number 54 on March 24, 1984, while peaking later at number 3, on June 16, 1984. In New Zealand, the song reached number 3, in Austria it reached number 5, in Switzerland it reached number 7, in France it peaked at number 9 and in Sweden it reached a peak of number 10.\n\nThe video for \"Time After Time\" was directed by Edd Griles, and its storyline is about a young woman leaving her lover behind when she becomes homesick and worried about her mother. Lauper's mother, brother, and then-boyfriend, David Wolff, appear in the video, and Lou Albano, who played her father in the \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" video, can be seen as a cook. Portions of the video were filmed at the now-closed Tom's Diner in Roxbury Township, New Jersey, the intersection of Route 46 and Route 10 and at the Morristown train station. Portions of the video were also shot in front of Betty's Department Store in Wharton, New Jersey, which was a staple of the community in the 1970s. According to Lauper, \"It was important to me that we were natural and human in the video. I wanted to convey somebody who walked her own path and did not always get along with everyone and did not always marry the guy.\" The video opens with Lauper watching the 1936 film \"The Garden of Allah\" and the final scene, where she gets on the train and waves goodbye to David, has Lauper crying for real.\n\n\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Digital\n\nPerhaps the earliest artist to interpret \"Time After Time\" was jazz trumpeter Miles Davis, who recorded an instrumental version of the song for his 1985 album \"You're Under Arrest\". The song became a regular part of Davis's live concerts until the end of his career, such as on \"Live Around the World\" (a live compilation recorded 1988 to 1991, released 1996).\n\nLauper later stated that while the song has been recorded by dozens of musicians, \"The most honored I ever felt was when Miles Davis covered it\", adding: \"the way he played it was pure magic.\"\n\nAmerican R&B singer INOJ recorded the song in 1998. Her version peaked at number six on Billboard Hot 100 Charts in the U.S. The music video of this version first aired on BET and The Box.\n\nAmerican singer Eva Cassidy covered the song on her posthumously released 2000 album Time After Time.\n\nNovaspace: The German Eurodance project covered the song on their album \"Novaspace\" (2002). It reached number 6 in Germany, number 7 in Austria and number 15 in Australia.\n\nAmerican alternative rock/pop punk band Quietdrive covered the song for their debut album \"When All That's Left Is You\" in 2006. The cover version was featured in the 2006 romantic comedy film \"John Tucker Must Die\" starring Jesse Metcalfe and Brittany Snow. The cover is their only charting song, hitting number 25 on the American Top 40 Countdown. The cover was certified gold by the RIAA.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2115723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2115723", "title": "Video game exploit", "text": "Video game exploit\n\nIn video games, an exploit is the use of a bug or glitches, game system, rates, hit boxes, speed or level design etc. by a player to their advantage in a manner not intended by the game's designers. Exploits have been classified as a form of cheating; however, the precise determination of what is or is not considered an exploit can be controversial. This debate stems from a number of factors but typically involves the argument that the issues are part of the game and require no changes or external programs to take advantage of them.\n\nWhether an exploit is considered a cheat is a matter of widespread debate that varies between genres, games, and other factors. The distinction is important as it decides how the developers and community responds to the issue and to the players who exploit the issue. On the one hand exploits can be considered illegitimate cheats that the developers should address and exploiters should be banned, while on the other hand exploits can be considered simply part of the game.\n\nArguments in favor of the cheating view involve the spirit of the game and the potentially damaging effects of the exploit on the game's community. While the rules or game code may not explicitly disallow a specific exploit, it may be seen that using that exploit goes against the spirit of the game. The potential damage of an exploit on a game has been described by a \"World of Warcraft\" community manager as \"devastating\".\n\nIn defense of these behaviors are arguments that the rules of the game allow it and that players might not know they are behaving against the designer's intention. So-called exploits, in this view, are not cheats because they do not change the game in any way and therefore could be accessible to all players if they know how to do it. The players who use such techniques may consider them fair for use in the game in cases when they are not explicitly disallowed in the Terms of Service or other such rules governing participation.\n\nWhile players more frequently exploit issues to gain advantage for themselves, sometimes they may use them instead to irritate other players, known as griefing. One team of gamers in \"Team Fortress 2\" produced popular online videos demonstrating their griefing and also several exploits present in the game, most of them being of little use for personal gain. Another famous incident during the \"Ultima Online\" beta test saw a player kill Lord British when that character was supposed to be invincible; the tester was later banned for exploiting because he did not report the bugs he found.\n\nCommon types of exploits include:\n\n\n\nEach game has the potential for exploits unique to that game's rules. For example, in \"World of Warcraft\", wall-walking allowed a player to climb steep mountains that are supposed to be impassable to get into unfinished areas or make one's character not attackable by mobs or other players. \"EverQuest\" had an exploit in player versus player analogous to weight cutting in sports whereby a player would intentionally lose levels by dying in order to compete against lower-level players while wielding higher-level items and skills (game mechanics exploit). In the game \"City of Heroes\" people were using teleport powers to place others inside the PvP zones' watchtowers which, originally designed as props for atmosphere, had no way in or out if he or she could not teleport (the towers have since gained a doorway).\n\nDevelopers may find it difficult to identify and respond to an exploit because a player who discovers a vulnerability in a game may be reluctant to inform the game's developers, in order to continue exploiting. However once developers do find exploits the response may include banning players who took advantage of the exploit, changing the game's rules to combat it, or even embracing the exploit. The positive opinions of the exploit can lead to the designers embracing it as emergent gameplay, such as when skiing in the \"Tribes\" series of games gained developer support. The now-standard practice of rocket jumping originated in a similar way, by exploiting game mechanics not foreseen by the developers. Otherwise, the developers may try to fix the underlying problem or discourage use of the exploit if the issue cannot be clearly addressed by technical means. In severe cases, players may be banned. Further, the game state of the world may need to be reset to restore game balance. For example, following a serious currency dupe exploit in \"EverQuest II\", the developers removed large amounts of duped money from the game to address the rampant inflation it caused in the game's virtual economy.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2115745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2115745", "title": "Cadmium selenide", "text": "Cadmium selenide\n\nCadmium selenide is an inorganic compound with the formula CdSe. It is a black to red-black solid that is classified as a II-VI semiconductor of the n-type. Much of the current research on cadmium selenide is focused on its nanoparticles.\n\nThree crystalline forms of CdSe are known which follow the structures of: wurtzite (hexagonal), sphalerite (cubic) and rock-salt (cubic). The sphalerite CdSe structure is unstable and converts to the wurtzite form upon moderate heating. The transition starts at about 130 °C, and at 700 °C it completes within a day. The rock-salt structure is only observed under high pressure.\n\nThe production of cadmium selenide has been carried out in two different ways. The preparation of bulk crystalline CdSe is done by the High-Pressure Vertical Bridgman method or High-Pressure Vertical Zone Melting.\n\nCadmium selenide may also be produced in the form of nanoparticles. (see applications for explanation) Several methods for the production of CdSe nanoparticles have been developed: arrested precipitation in solution, synthesis in structured media, high temperature pyrolysis, sonochemical, and radiolytic methods are just a few.\n\nProduction of cadmium selenide by arrested precipitation in solution is performed by introducing alkylcadmium and trioctylphosphine selenide (TOPSe) precursors into a heated solvent under controlled conditions.\n\nCdSe nanoparticles can be modified by production of two phase materials with ZnS coatings. The surfaces can be further modified, e.g. with mercaptoacetic acid, to confer solubility.\nSynthesis in structured environments refers to the production of cadmium selenide in liquid crystal or surfactant solutions. The addition of surfactants to solutions often results in a phase change in the solution leading to a liquid crystallinity. A liquid crystal is similar to a solid crystal in that the solution has long range translational order. Examples of this ordering are layered alternating sheets of solution and surfactant, micelles, or even a hexagonal arrangement of rods.\n\nHigh temperature pyrolysis synthesis is usually carried out using an aerosol containing a mixture of volatile cadmium and selenium precursors. The precursor aerosol is then carried through a furnace with an inert gas, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, or argon. In the furnace the precursors react to form CdSe as well as several by-products.\n\nCdSe-derived nanoparticles with sizes below 10 nm exhibit a property known as quantum confinement. Quantum confinement results when the electrons in a material are confined to a very small volume. Quantum confinement is size dependent, meaning the properties of CdSe nanoparticles are tunable based on their size. One type of CdSe nanoparticle is a CdSe quantum dot. This discretization of energy states results in electronic transitions that vary by quantum dot size. Larger quantum dots have closer electronic states than smaller quantum dots which means that the energy required to excite an electron from HOMO to the LUMO is lower than the same electronic transition in a smaller quantum dot. This quantum confinement effect can be observed as a red shift in absorbance spectra for nanocrystals with larger diameters. Quantum confinement effects in quantum dots can also result in fluorescence intermittency, called \"blinking.\"\n\nCdSe quantum dots have been implemented in a wide range of applications including solar cells, light emitting diodes, and biofluorescent tagging. CdSe-based materials also have potential uses in biomedical imaging. Human tissue is permeable to near infra-red light. By injecting appropriately prepared CdSe nanoparticles into injured tissue, it may be possible to image the tissue in those injured areas.\n\nCdSe quantum dots are usually composed of a CdSe core and a ligand shell. Ligands play important roles in the stability and solubility of the nanoparticles. During synthesis, ligands stabilize growth to prevent aggregation and precipitation of the nanocrystals. These capping ligands also affect the quantum dot’s electronic and optical properties by passivating surface electronic states. An application that depends on the nature of the surface ligands is the synthesis of CdSe thin films. The density of the ligands on the surface and the length of the ligand chain affect the separation between nanocrystal cores which in turn influence stacking and conductivity. Understanding the surface structure of CdSe quantum dots in order to investigate the structure’s unique properties and for further functionalization for greater synthetic variety requires a rigorous description of the ligand exchange chemistry on the quantum dot surface.\n\nA prevailing belief is that trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) or trioctylphosphine (TOP), a neutral ligand derived from a common precursor used in the synthesis of CdSe dots, caps the surface of CdSe quantum dots. However, results from recent studies challenge this model. Using NMR, quantum dots have been shown to be nonstoichiometric meaning that the cadmium to selenide ratio is not one to one. CdSe dots have excess cadmium cations on the surface that can form bonds with anionic species such as carboxylate chains. The CdSe quantum dot would be charge unbalanced if TOPO or TOP were indeed the only type of ligand bound to the dot.\n\nThe CdSe ligand shell may contain both X type ligands which form covalent bonds with the metal and L type ligands that form dative bonds. It has been shown that these ligands can undergo exchange with other ligands. Examples of X type ligands that have been studied in the context of CdSe nanocrystal surface chemistry are sulfides and thiocyanates. Examples of L type ligands that have been studied are amines and phosphines (ref). A ligand exchange reaction in which tributylphosphine ligands were displaced by primary alkylamine ligands on chloride terminated CdSe dots has been reported. Stoichiometry changes were monitored using proton and phosphorus NMR. Photoluminescence properties were also observed to change with ligand moiety. The amine bound dots had significantly higher photoluminescent quantum yields than the phosphine bound dots.\n\nCdSe material is transparent to infra-red (IR) light and has seen limited use in photoresistors and in windows for instruments utilizing IR light. The material is also highly luminescent.\nCdSe is a component of the pigment cadmium orange.\n\nCadmium is a toxic heavy metal and appropriate precautions should be taken when handling it and its compounds. Selenides are toxic in large amounts. Cadmium selenide is a known carcinogen to humans and medical attention should be sought if swallowed, dust inhaled, or if contact with skin or eyes occurs.\n\n"}

The largest settlement in the district is also named Silivri. The mayor is Özcan Işıklar (CHP).\n\nSilivri is located bordering Büyükçekmece to the east, Çatalca to the north, Çorlu and Marmara Ereğli (both districts of Tekirdağ Province) to the west, Çerkezköy to the north-west (one of Tekirdağ Province) and with the Sea of Marmara to the south. It is with an area of the second largest district of Istanbul Province after Çatalca. The seat of the district is the city of Silivri.\n\nThe district consists of 8 towns and 18 villages, and its population is 155,923 (2013 census). 75,702 in the city of Silivri, the remaining in the surrounding towns and villages – listed below.\n\nEstablished in 2008, Turkey's most modern (and Europe's largest) prison complex is located west of Silivri.\n\nSilivri, the ancient Greek Selymbria or Selybria (), owed its historical importance to the natural harbor and the position on the major commercial roads. It was a colony of Megara founded on a steep 56 m high hill east of the bay, but excavations show that it was a Thracian settlement before it was a Greek colony.\n\nAccording to Strabo, the city's name is a combination of the name of the mythological founder of the city, Selus, and the Thracian word that Strabo thought was used for\" polis\", \"bria\". This, however, did not mean polis, and had another meaning.\n\nSilivri is the birthplace of the physician Herodicus, and was an ally of the Athenians in 351 BC. Until the second half of the 2nd century BC, the city could preserve its autonomy, but after its neighbours Byzantium and Perinthos became more powerful, the city fell under their control during the next centuries. The settlement shrank into a village under the governance of the Roman Empire. In the early 5th century, the town was officially renamed Eudoxiopolis (Εὐδοξιόπολις) in Greek, during the reign of the Byzantine emperor Arcadius (377–408), after his wife Aelia Eudoxia, though this name did not survive. In 805 AD, the Bulgarian Khan Kroum pillaged the town. In the late 9th century, Emperor Michael III constructed a fortress on the top of the hill, the ruins of which still remain, during an era in which the Byzantine Empire suffered attacks by Saracen corsairs and Russians. With the Fourth Crusade, and the fall of Constantinople to the Latin Empire in 1204, the fortress fell in quick succession to the Latin Empire, Bulgarian, back to the Latins and finally was recaptured by the Byzantine successor state of the Empire of Nicaea in 1247, who were finally able to recapture Constantinople and restore the empire in 1261.\n\nIn 1346, the Ottomans became an ally of the pretender for the Emperor John VI Cantacuzenus (1292–1383), and helped him against his rival John V Palaeologus (1332–1391). The same year, Sultan Orhan I married Theodora, the daughter of John VI in Selymbria.\n\nIn 1399, Selymbria fell to the Ottomans, marking their complete encirclement of Constantinople by land in Europe. Many contemporary observers believed from then on it was a mere matter of time before the Ottomans took the Byzantine capital. However, after their disastrous defeat at the hands of Timur the Ottomans returned Selymbria and several other possessions to the Byzantines in 1403. It was sometimes attacked by the Ottomans in later years, but was not captured.\n\nDuring the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, Silivri, along with Epibatos, stood up against the Ottoman armies, and surrendered only after the city had fallen. Selymbria extended out of the walls only during the Ottoman era because the non-Muslim residents like Greeks, Armenians and Jews lived within the city walls, and the Turks built their houses outside the walls at the coast. While the non-Muslims were engaged mostly in growing grapes, vinification and silk production, the Turks earned their life by fishing and making yogurt. The town remained a summer resort during the Ottoman time, as it was during the Byzantine era.\n\nOn the order of Suleiman the Magnificent, architect Mimar Sinan built 1562 a stone bridge with 33 arches just west of Silivri. The historical bridge, called \"Uzunköprü\" (The \"Long Bridge\"), is still in use today, however one arch is not visible due to sedimentation.\n\nPrior to World War I, some Silivrian Jews immigrated to the town of Camagüey, Cuba. Russians occupied Silivri on February 5, 1878 for 1 month until 3 March 1878. Bulgarians occupied it on November 16, 1912 for 9 months until May 30, 1913.\n\nAccording to the Ottoman population statistics of 1914, the kaza of Silivri had a total population of 16.470, consisting of 10.302 Greeks, 3.759 Muslims, 1.427 Jews, 781 Armenians, 103 Bulgarians and 98 Roma people.\n\nDuring the war, many more Sephardim in the city left as conditions worsened due to the war. Many of these Turkish Jews emigrated to the United States settling primarily in New York and Seattle. Others went to Palestine, France and South America.\n\nAccording to the Treaty of Sèvres, Silivri became a part of Greece on July 20, 1920. However, Italians took it over from the withdrawing Greek troops on October 22, 1922, according to the Armistice of Mudanya. Finally, Turkish forces entered Silivri on November 1, 1922. It was part of Çatalca province between 1923–1926 and was bounded to Istanbul Province in 1926. It was enlarged with joining of Gümüşyaka (formerly Eski Ereğli) village from Çorlu district.\n\nDuring the summer months, the population increases 4–5 times. Silivri is far from the city center of Istanbul, and is a popular summer resort for many Istanbul residents with its coast. It is on the highway and the motorway , which connect Turkey to Europe via Edirne. It takes about an hour and a half to get here from the city so is feasible for use in the summer months as a weekend and holiday retreat, although the road out here is heaving with traffic in summer.\n\nBeing so accessible from Istanbul, the Marmara coast has long been used for holidaying by Istanbul's people. As the city has grown, these facilities have moved further and further away. Once Florya and Yeşilköy were resorts, today it is Tekirdağ and even further. Silivri had its heydey in the 1960s and 1970s as families would come by the busload to complexes of holiday flats that were built on the beach. Most had their own stretch of beach. The Marmara Sea here has suffered from pollution in the 1980s and 1990s but now efforts have been made to clean it up and people do swim. Some of these places have sports centres, discos, go-kart tracks, games rooms for the kids etc. and many Istanbul families have pleasant memories of trips to Silivri in the 1970s and 1980s, sitting on the beach in the summer moonlight while the kids run about until they drop from tiredness. Some still go today. All the facilities are located in the holiday housing area, the town centre of Silivri has little to offer in the way of cinema, theatre or any other cultural amenities.\n\nNow the coast has also been blessed with resort hotels and country clubs with sports facilities including golf courses, horse riding centres and tennis courts, health and conference centers. At weekend the area is crowded with day trippers.\n\nWith all this development it is hard to find a stretch of open coastline.\n\nThe winter months are cold here, as bitter weather blows across Thrace from the Balkans, and holiday homes in Silivri are not much used from mid-September until May or even June.\n\nThe district has great agricultural potential thanks to its almost flat landscape, mild Thracian climate and yield-effective soil, and in the 1950s and 1960s the pasture was so rich that the yogurt of Silivri was renowned. Now the reputation of the yogurt has declined due to poor quality control and mismanagement of the brand. The Silivri Yoğurt Festivali used to be a major event but nowadays there is less interest and in some years it is not even held. Wheat (246 km²), sunflower (105 km²) and barley (50 km²) are cultivated here. Vineyards were once important but have declined since the 1970s. Livestock is still important.\n\nSilivri has two sports clubsi Silivrispor and Alibeyspor. Established in 1957, Silivrispor has two active branches, football and basketball. Silivrispor's professional football team play in the Apor Toto 3rd Şeague. The basketball section eas founded in 2014. Alibeyspor, named after a neighborhood of Silivri, was established in 1989. The club's main activity is in football. Their amateur football team play in the Istanbul Super Amateuar League, and the women's team in the Turkish Women's Third League.\n\nSport venues in Silivri are the 2,700-seating capacity Müjdat Gürsu Stadium, named after Müjdat Gürsu (1971–1994) a local footballer, and Alibey Sport Hall.\n\n\nThere are a number of hospitals and special health institutions in Silivri, state owned and private run:\n\n(total population 41,669)\n(total population 21,956)\n\n\nSilivri is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

It can be found in conservative Indo-European languages such as Latin and Lithuanian, and also in Finnic languages or European derived languages with high percentage of Latin-based words like Esperanto. It should not be confused with the prospective, which denotes actions that are about to start. The English language can approximate the inchoative aspect through the verbs \"to become\" or \"to get\" combined with an adjective.\n\nSince inchoative is a grammatical aspect and not a tense, it can be combined with tenses to form past inchoative, frequentative past inchoative and future inchoative, all used in Lithuanian. In Russian, inchoatives are regularly derived from unidirectional imperfective verbs of motion by adding the prefix по- \"po-\", e.g. \"bezhát&apos;\", \"pobezhát&apos;\": \"to run\", \"to start running\". Also compare \"shli\" (normal past tense plural of \"idtí\", \"to go\") with \"Poshlí!\" meaning approximately \"Let's get going!\". Certain other verbs can be marked for the inchoative aspect with the prefix за- \"za-\" (e.g. \"on zasmejálsja\", \"he started laughing\", \"on zaplákal\" \"he started crying\"). Similar behavior is observed in Ukrainian, and in other Slavic languages. In Latin, the inchoative aspect was marked with the infix \"-sc-\" (', I love; ', I'm starting to love, I'm falling in love; ', to flower, ', to start flowering, etc.). In Esperanto, inchoatives are regularly derived from any infinitive verb by adding the prefix \"ek-\", e.g. ', ': \"to dance\", \"to start dancing\".\n\nThe term inchoative verb is used by generative grammarians to refer to a class of verbs that reflect a change of state; e. g., \"John aged\" or \"The fog cleared\". This usage bears little or no relationship to the aspectual usage described above.\n"}

It was awarded to individuals, military units, political and other organisations who distinguished themselves by extraordinary heroic deeds during war and in peacetime. The recipients were thereafter known as People's Heroes of Yugoslavia or National Heroes of Yugoslavia. The vast majority was awarded to partisans for actions during the Second World War. A total of 1,322 awards were awarded in Yugoslavia, and 19 were awarded to the foreigners.\n\nIn 1998, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia decided to award the Order of the People's Hero again and decorated several military units, but no individuals.\n\nThe bulletin of the Supreme command of the People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia no. 12–13 (December 1941 and January 1942) announced the establishment of the title of \"People's Hero\" for heroic and self-sacrificing participants of the People's Liberation War. The first person to be awarded the title was Petar Leković. A total of 22 persons were awarded this title. On 15 August 1943, the title was formalized as an order together with Order of the People's Liberation, Order of Bravery, Order of the Partisan Star, Order of Brotherhood and Unity and the Medal for Bravery. At the same time, all the persons who already held the title of the People's Hero were awarded the order.\n\nThe Order consists of an oval gold badge showing a soldier with rifle and banner superimposed upon a rayed star surrounded by a wreath of laurel. The badge is suspended from a red ribbon, with a narrow white stripe towards each edge. The design for this and the other Orders were undertaken by the painter Đorđe Andrejević Kun and the sculptor Antun Augustinčić. Before 29 November 1943, the title of People's Hero was awarded by the Central Comity of KPJ, after 1945 it was awarded by the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Yugoslavia, and starting in 1953 by the President of Yugoslavia.\n\nFrom its inception until around 1993, the Order had been awarded nearly 1,400 times. Marshal Josip Broz Tito was awarded the Order three times: in 1944, 1972 and 1977. The holders of the order were entitled to certain benefits, like free fares on public transport, and pensions for the surviving family members of deceased people's heroes. Although the benefits have since been downscaled, post-Yugoslav countries still provide certain benefits to people's heroes. Many schools and streets in post-war Yugoslavia were named after people's heroes, and many of the names remain, to varying degrees in different successor countries.\n\nNot only people, but cities, military units and organizations were also awarded the order. Eight cities in Yugoslavia were awarded the order and proclaimed \"hero cities\": Belgrade, Cetinje, Drvar, Ljubljana, Novi Sad, Prilep, Pristina, and Zagreb.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of SFR Yugoslavia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was formed, and later renamed Serbia and Montenegro. In 1998, it passed a law that continued to use some of the decorations of former Yugoslavia, among them Order of the People's Hero, making it the fourth highest order after the Order of Yugoslavia, Order of the Yugoslav Star and the Order of Freedom.\n\nThe Serbian media ridiculed several proposals to decorate Slobodan Milošević with the Order of the People's hero because he would have had to decorate himself. It was never given to any individuals, but several military units active in the Kosovo War were decorated:\n\nNotable recipients of the order include: \n\n\n\nA total of 1,322 persons were awarded in Yugoslavia by 1981. Most of the awarded were men (1231) and 91 were women. Most People's Heroes were either miners or industrial workers (34%), 19% were university and high school students, 18% were farmworkers and 13% were experts of all kinds.\n\nMost of the awarded were very young. Half of them joined the Army before the 25th birthday, and only 325 of them were over 30. 42% of the Heroes who died in the war were between 16 and 26 years old, 38% were between 27 and 34. Three Heroes were less than 17 years old when died. Milka Bosnić was the youngest recipient of the order, she was just 15 when killed during the Raid on Drvar.\n\nMost recipients were awarded in the years following the World War II, most of them between 1951 and 1953. Tito was the only person to be awarded multiple times, he was awarded the order three times. Of the 955 recipients who died in the war, 77% were killed in combat, about 15% was executed or died in prison, and about 7% died from wounds. Most of the Heroes died in 1943 (about 30%) and in 1942 (27.5%). Nine of them were killed after the war officially ended during the fight with remaining enemy forces. 55 People's Heroes committed suicide to escape arresting.\n\nMost of the recipients of the Order were born in Croatia (21.9%), than in Bosnia and Herzegovina (20.6%), Montenegro (18.7%), Central Serbia (15%) and 11.05% were born in Slovenia. Most of those who died during the World War II died in Bosnia and Herzegovina (32%). In 1957 there were 410 living People's Heroes, in 1975 there were 367, and in 1981 there were 343 living Heroes.\n\n\n\n"}

It is owned by Entercom and airs a news/talk radio format. The studios and offices are located on Executive Drive in Farmington, Connecticut with other radio stations. The transmitter is located off Deercliff Road in Avon, Connecticut. WTIC is the primary entry point (PEP) for the Emergency Alert System (EAS) in Connecticut.\n\nWTIC is a Class A, clear channel station powered at 50,000 watts, the maximum permitted for commercial AM stations. It has a non-directional signal in the daytime. But to protect the other Class A station on AM 1080, KRLD Dallas, also owned by Entercom, WTIC uses a directional antenna at night, when radio waves travel farther. The signal can be picked up throughout Southern New England and parts of Vermont, New Hampshire and New York by day. With a good radio, WTIC can be heard over much of the Eastern United States and Eastern Canada at night.\n\nWeekdays begin with \"Mornings with Ray Dunaway\" with newscaster Joe D'Ambrosio. Late mornings feature Jim Vicevich and afternoon drive time is hosted by Todd Feinberg. The rest of the schedule is made up of syndicated shows from Rush Limbaugh at noon, Clark Howard and Sean Hannity in the evening and \"Coast to Coast AM with George Noory\" overnight. For decades, WTIC has been part of the Boston Red Sox Radio Network.\n\nSaturday mornings begin with a local news and talk show hosted by Steve Parker. Other weekend shows are centered on money, health, gardening, home repair, cars, law, pets, computers, veterans and travel, some of which are paid brokered programming. For three hours on Sundays, Glen Colligan hosts the \"WTIC Tag Sale\" where listeners offer household items for sale. Syndicated weekend hosts include Bill Cunningham and Ric Edelman. \n\nLocal newscasters are heard at the beginning of most hours while WTIC carries CBS News Radio overnight, followed by a brief Connecticut news summary. WTIC's newsroom is staffed 24 hours a day with more than a dozen newscasters and reporters. It maintains a news and weather sharing agreement with its one-time sister station, CBS affiliate WFSB (channel 3).\n\nOn February 25, 1925, WTIC first signed on. It was the second radio station in Connecticut, after WDRC, which went on the air in 1922. By the 1930s, WTIC was powered at 50,000 watts, originally at 1060 kilocycles. In 1941, when the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) went into effect, WTIC moved to its current dial position at 1080 kHz.\n\nWTIC was owned by the Travelers Insurance Company, from which it got its WTIC call sign. It was among the first affiliates of the NBC Red Network, carrying its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \"Golden Age of Radio.\" \n\nWTIC is known for its historic time tone, which is a broadcast of the Morse code letter \"V\" every hour on the hour since 1943. This makes it one of the oldest continuously broadcasting radio time tones in the world. WTIC employs a GPS master clock system that fires the custom-built time-tone generator shortly before the top of the hour, timed such that the final tone of the sequence occurs precisely on the hour (Even though everything else heard on the station is on a 10-second delay), and listeners have been setting their watches to WTIC for many years. The notes of the sequence were pitched to mimic the famous opening sequence of Ludwig van Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, whose \"short-short-short-long\" rhythm matches that of the Morse code letter \"V\". The Morse code letter \"V\" for Victory was selected during the height of World War II. \n\nWTIC's original studios were in the Travelers Insurance Building at 26 Grove Street in Hartford. Grove Street was later renamed Bob Steele Street in honor of longtime WTIC personality Bob Steele, who spent 66 years on WTIC, most of them as the morning drive time host. He joined the station in 1936. At one point, nearly a third of all radios in the Hartford area were tuned to Steele's wake up show. Even after retiring from weekday mornings in 1991, he continued hosting Saturday mornings until his death in 2002 at age 91.\n\nIn 1940, WTIC began experimenting with FM radio, putting W1XSO on 43.2 MHz on the air. It later became 96.5 WTIC-FM. In 1957, it added a TV station, Channel 3 WTIC-TV. As network programming moved from radio to television in the 1950s, WTIC-AM-FM switched to a full service, middle of the road format of popular music, news and sports. In the 1960s, WTIC-FM started playing blocks of classical music in the afternoon and evening, eventually ending its simulcast of 1080 WTIC.\n\nIn 1973, Travelers Insurance announced it would divest its broadcasting properties. Channel 3 was sold to the Post-Newsweek Corporation (now the Graham Media Group) in 1974, switching its call letters to WFSB. WTIC-AM-FM were sold to a group of its managers, doing business as the \"Ten-Eighty Corporation.\" Also in the 1970s, some talk shows were added to WTIC's line up. In the 1980s, as fewer listeners tuned to AM radio for music, WTIC added more talk programming, eventually eliminating the music shows. \n\nIn 1991, Bob Steele decided to retire from hosting weekday mornings. Tom McCarthy had already begun doing the early part of the morning shift and took over the entire 5:30 to 10 a.m. time slot. In 1998, CBS Radio acquired WTIC-AM-FM. After being an NBC Radio affiliate since its early days, WTIC switched to CBS Radio News for its world and national news coverage.\n\nIn December 2008, the station made several programming changes.

It is part of a lake and river system that has become a popular cruising sailboat destination.\n\nThe river begins at the point where it flows out of Lake Izabal. At the entrance to the river there is a small Spanish colonial fort, the Castillo de San Felipe de Lara, built to stop pirates entering the lake from the Caribbean when this part of Central America was an important shipping staging point.\n\nJust after the river flows from Lake Izabal it is spanned by one of the biggest bridges in Central America. On one side of the bridge is the town of Fronteras, commonly referred to by the name Río Dulce, the local center of commerce for the area. Fronteras has a local vegetable market, attracting locals from the countryside who arrive in dugout canoes. Most of these boats are powered with Japanese outboard motors but many come to market day paddling these \"cayucos\" by hand. On the other side is the town of El Relleno. Nearby is the children's village of Casa Guatemala, an orphanage that houses roughly 250 children and provides them with education and nourishment.\n\nFrom Fronteras the river flows east for a couple of miles. In this stretch there are several marinas and resorts. The river then flows into a long narrow lake called El Golfete. This lake has an island and a large natural anchorage. A few houses and a couple of small businesses line the shore. El Golfete is about long and a couple of miles wide.\n\nFrom El Golfete the river meanders for in a spectacular gorge. The sides of the gorge rise up to on either side and are covered with teak, mahogany and palms. Wild flowers bloom throughout the foliage and howler monkeys and toucans can be seen. Waterfalls flow over the lip of the gorge after rainfall.\n\nThe river enters the Caribbean Sea near the Garifuna town of Livingston.\n\nThe Río Dulce National Park is in the department of Izabal in Guatemala.\nThe park covers an area of along the banks of the Dulce river and the El Golfete.\n\nThe film \"The New Adventures of Tarzan\" was filmed entirely on location in Guatemala in 1935. They reached some locations using the railroad service in Guatemala, which controlled by the American International Railways of Central America (IRCA), owned by the United Fruit Company— and had major stations at Puerto San José, Guatemala City and Puerto Barrios.\n\nThe railroad company offered tours to visit the UFCO banana plantations in Izabal and the Maya city of Quiriguá —which at the time was placed within UFCO property— and offered their visitors the option to comfortably sail Río Dulce and Lake Izabal to Livingston in one of their steam boats.

He won the French Open in 1976, and was the only player ever to defeat Björn Borg at Roland Garros, doing so on two occasions.\n\nPanatta was born in Rome. His father was the caretaker of the \"Tennis Club Parioli\", and as a youngster he learned to play the game on the club's clay courts. He became a successful European junior player before turning professional.\n\nIn his early career, Panatta won top-level professional titles at Bournemouth in 1973, Florence in 1974, and at Kitzbühel and Stockholm in 1975.\n\nThe pinnacle of his career arrived in 1976, when he won the French Open defeating Harold Solomon in the final 6–1, 6–4, 4–6, 7–6. In the first round he had saved a match point against Czechoslovakian player Pavel Hutka. In the same year he also won the Italian Open, having saved 11 match points in his first round match against the Australian Kim Warwick, and beating Guillermo Vilas in the final (2–6, 7–6, 6–2, 7–6). He finished off 1976 by helping Italy capture its first-ever Davis Cup title, winning two singles and a doubles rubber in the final against Chile. He reached his career-high singles ranking of world No. 4 that year.\n\nPanatta is the only player to have defeated Björn Borg at the French Open. He achieved this feat twice – in the fourth round in 1973 (7–6, 2–6, 7–5, 7–6), and in the quarterfinals in 1976 (6–3, 6–3, 2–6, 7–6). He also faced Borg at the semifinal stage of the 1975 tournament; Borg won on this occasion in four sets.\n\nIn 1977, Panatta won the World Championship Tennis in Houston, where he defeated Jimmy Connors and Vitas Gerulaitis. He followed this up with another title in Tokyo in 1978.\n\nPanatta was less successful on fast surfaces. On grass courts, he reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 1979. He was beaten at that stage by Pat Du Pré in five sets (3–6, 6–4, 6–7, 6–4, 6–3).\n\nAfter the 1976 Davis Cup triumph, Panatta helped Italy reach the Davis Cup final on three further occasions – in 1977, 1979 and 1980. The team lost to Australia in 1977, the United States in 1979, and to Czechoslovakia in 1980. Overall, Panatta compiled a 64–36 Davis Cup record (55–17 on clay).\n\nHis final career singles title came in 1980 at Florence. He retired from the professional tour in 1983. Since retiring as a player, Panatta has served as captain of Italy's Davis Cup team, and as tournament director of the Rome Masters. He is also a professional powerboat racer.\n\n"}

The main purpose of MOP, held since 1974, is to select and train the six members of the U.S. team for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). Students qualify for the program by taking the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO). The top twelve American scorers from all grades form the \"black\" group. The approximately eighteen next highest American scorers among students from 11th grade and under form the \"blue\" group. \n\nIn 2004, the program was expanded to include approximately thirty of the highest-scoring American freshmen and sophomores each year, the \"red\" group; this was later split into two, forming the \"green\" group, which consists of approximately fifteen of the highest-scoring freshmen and sophomores who have qualified through the USAMO, and the \"red\" group, which consists of those who have qualified through the USAJMO. The colorful designations of these groups were adapted from Karate. In 2013, the red and green groups were unified. Also, with the new system the Black Group includes more or less only the IMO team, which is not necessarily all USAMO winners.\n\nUntil 2011, only Black MOPpers were eligible for the selection to the USA IMO team, determined by combining USAMO results with results of a similar competition called the Team Selection Test (TST). From 2011, a new competition called the Team Selection Test Selection Test (TSTST) was established; this competition is open for any of the participants of MOP, and along with results from the USAMO, determines the students who take the TSTs. This ultimately, along with the USAMO and MOP competitions, determines the IMO team.\n\nCanadians are allowed to write the USAMO but not to participate in MOP unless they are U.S. residents. Occasionally, when Canadians are amongst the USAMO winners, top scoring honorable mentions are added to the black group. These additional students are also eligible for the IMO team. In 2005, such a student did qualify for the team and went on to win a gold medal at the IMO. Under the TSTST system, effective 2011, honorable mentions can qualify for the IMO team and will be placed in the black group if they do so. \n\nRed cutoffs 2010 onward refer to USAJMO while 2009 before refer to USAMO. \nHowever, the cutoff scores for groups are not entirely rigid; some students are moved between groups at the beginning of the program. However, they do dictate who is invited to the program. As part of the process of selecting members of the European Girls Math Olympiad, many years the Math Olympiad program has additionally invited female students to the camp. In 2017, the cutoff was 13 for the USAMO and 20 for the USAJMO. In 2018, the cutoff was 8 for USAMO and 11 for USAJMO.\n\nThe first few MOPs were held at Rutgers University. After that, and until 1995, the program was alternately hosted by the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland in even-numbered years and by the United States Military Academy at West Point in odd-numbered years. The 1995 MOP was held at IMSA in Aurora, Illinois, where then-MOP director Titu Andreescu was a member of the math faculty. Most of the MOPs from 1996 on forward have been held in Lincoln, Nebraska where the AMC headquarters is located. An exception was made in the summer of 2001, as the United States would be hosting the IMO that year in Washington, D.C., and nearby Georgetown was selected as the location for MOP. Starting in 2015, MOP was held at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nFor years, the idea of extending the training program for the U.S. IMO team was discussed. During the 2004-2005 school year, U.S. IMO team coach Zuming Feng directed the Winter Olympiad Training Program, utilizing the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) site for discussion purposes. The program was short-lived, lasting only that year. MOP participants are now able to participate for free in Art of Problem Solving's WOOT program for year-round olympiad training.\n\n"}

The key event at the conference was the presentation of data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink examining the possibility of a link between the mercury compound thimerosol in vaccines and neurological problems in children who had received those vaccines.\n\nA 2005 article by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., published by \"Rolling Stone\" and Salon.com, focused on the Simpsonwood meeting as part of a conspiracy to withhold or falsify vaccine-safety information. However, Kennedy's article contained numerous major factual errors and, after a number of corrections, was ultimately retracted by Salon.com. Nonetheless, on the basis of Kennedy's claims, the conference gained notoriety in the anti-vaccination movement.\n\nThe conference was convened following a resolution by the Congress of the United States in 1997 requiring the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to review the thimerosal content of approved drugs and biologics. Three vaccines of primary interest were discussed: hepatitis B vaccine, DPT vaccine, and the Hib vaccine.\n\nAttendees included experts in the fields of autism, pediatrics, toxicology, epidemiology and vaccines. Also in attendance were approximately half a dozen public-health organisations and pharmaceutical companies, as well as eleven consultants to the CDC, a rapporteur, and a statistician. The meeting served as a prelude to vaccine policy meetings held by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which sets U.S. vaccine policy for the CDC. The session was also to serve as the initial meeting of the ACIP work group on thimerosal and immunization.\n\nPresentations and supporting documents from the conference were subject to a news embargo until June 21, 2000, at which point they were published by the ACIP. After the conference, researchers carried out a planned second phase to further analyze and clarify the study's preliminary findings. The results of this second analysis were published in 2003.\n\nThe June 20, 2005, issue of \"Rolling Stone\" contained an article written by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., entitled \"Deadly Immunity\". The article, which was also published on Salon.com, focused on the Simpsonwood conference, and alleged that government and private industry had colluded to \"thwart the Freedom of Information Act\" and \"withhold\" vaccine-safety findings from the public. Kennedy said that the Simpsonwood data linked thimerosal in vaccines to the rise in autism, but that the lead researcher later \"reworked his data to bury the link between thimerosal and autism.\" However, Kennedy's article contained numerous errors, including overstating the amount of ethylmercury in vaccines, wrongly claiming that a researcher held a patent on one of the discussed vaccines, and erroneously claiming that the rotavirus vaccine contained thimerosal.\n\nSalon.com later said that the errors in the article \"went far in undermining Kennedy’s exposé\", and corrected it on five occasions. The publisher later retracted it in January 2011, stating that criticisms of the article and flaws in the science connecting autism and vaccines undermined its value.\n\nBy the time the final study results discussed at Simpsonwood were published in 2003, the lead researcher, Thomas Verstraeten, had gone to work for GlaxoSmithKline. Kennedy contended that the delay in publication gave Verstraeten sufficient time to fix the data around the CDC's alleged objective of obscuring a link between thimerosal and autism. Verstraeten denied the allegations, and published an account of the matter in the journal \"Pediatrics\".\n\nIn September 2007, the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions rejected allegations of impropriety against Verstraeten and the CDC. Addressing Kennedy's statements, the Committee found that: \"Instead of hiding the [Simpsonwood] data or restricting access to it, CDC distributed it, often to individuals who had never seen it before, and solicited outside opinion regarding how to interpret it. The transcript of these discussions was made available to the public.\"\n\n\n"}

His wordless novels have influenced the development of the graphic novel. Strongly associated with his wood engravings, he also worked in watercolor, oil, brush and ink, lithography and mezzotint. Ward was a son of Methodist minister and political organizer Harry F. Ward.\n\nHis most well known book is \"Gods' Man\".\n\nLynd Kendall Ward was born on June 26, 1905, in Chicago, Illinois. His father, Harry F. Ward, was born in Chiswick, England, in 1873; the elder Ward was a Methodist who moved to the United States in 1891 after reading the progressive \"Social Aspects of Christianity\" (1889) by Richard T. Ely. He named his son after the rural town of Lyndhurst, located in the south coastal county of Hampshire, where he had lived for two years as a teenager prior to his emigration. Ward's mother, Harriet May \"Daisy\" Kendall Ward, was born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1873. The couple met at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois, and were married in 1899. Their first child, Gordon Hugh Ward, was born in June 1903, and a third, Muriel Ward, was born February 18, 1907.\n\nSoon after birth, Ward developed tuberculosis; his parents took him north of Sault Ste. Marie in Canada for several months to recover. He partly recovered, and continued to suffer from symptoms of the disease throughout his childhood, as well as from inner ear and mastoid infections. In the hope of improving his health, the family moved to Oak Park, Illinois, where his father became a pastor at the Euclid Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nWard was early drawn to art, and decided to become an artist when his first-grade teacher told him that \"Ward\" spelled backward is \"draw\". Having skipped a grade, Ward graduated from grammar school a year early in 1918. The family moved to Englewood, New Jersey, and Ward entered Englewood High School, where he became art editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, and learned linoleum-block printing. In 1922, he graduated with honors in art, mathematics, and debate.\n\nWard studied fine arts at Columbia Teachers College in New York. He edited the \"Jester of Columbia\", to which he contributed arts and crafts how-to articles. His roommate arranged a blind date for Ward and May Yonge McNeer (1902–1994) in 1923; May had been the first female undergraduate at the University of Georgia in her freshman year. The two married on June 11, 1926, shortly after their graduation, and left for Europe for their honeymoon.\n\nAfter four months in eastern Europe, the couple settled in Leipzig in Germany for a year, where Ward studied as a special one-year student at the . He learned etching from Alois Kolb, lithography from , and wood engraving from Hans Alexander \"Theodore\" Mueller; Ward was particularly influenced by Mueller. Ward chanced across a copy of Flemish artist Frans Masereel's wordless novel \"The Sun\" (1919), a story told in sixty-three woodcuts without captions.\n\nWard returned to the United States in September 1927, with a number of book publishers in his portfolio . In 1928, his first commissioned work illustrated Dorothy Rowe's \"The Begging Deer: Stories of Japanese Children\" with eight brush drawings. May helped with background research for the illustrations, and wrote another book of Japanese folk tales, \"Prince Bantam\" (1929), with illustrations by Ward. Other work at the time included illustrations for the children's book \"\" by Hildegarde Swift, and an illustrated edition of Oscar Wilde's poem \"Ballad of Reading Gaol\".\n\nIn 1929, Ward was inspired to create a wordless novel of his own after he came across German artist Otto Nückel's \"Destiny\" (1926). The first American wordless novel, was published by Smith & Cape that October, the week before the Wall Street Crash of 1929; over the next four years, it sold more than 20,000 copies. He made five more such works: \"Madman's Drum\" (1930), \"Wild Pilgrimage\" (1932), \"Prelude to a Million Years\" (1933), \"Song Without Words\" (1936), and \"Vertigo\" (1937).\n\nIn addition to woodcuts, Ward also worked in watercolor, oil, brush and ink, lithography and mezzotint. Ward illustrated over a hundred children's books, several of which were collaborations with his wife, May. Starting in 1938, Ward became a frequent illustrator of the Heritage Limited Editions Club's series of classic works. He was well known for the political themes of his artwork, often addressing labor and class issues. In 1932 he founded Equinox Cooperative Press. He was a member of the Society of Illustrators, a member and President of the Society of American Graphic Artists (SAGA), and the National Academy of Design.\n\nWard lived with his wife in a home in Cresskill, New Jersey to which they added a studio for their work.\n\nWard retired to his home in Reston, Virginia, in 1979. He died on June 28, 1985, two days after his 80th birthday, predeceasing his wife.\n\nIn celebration of the art and life of this American printmaker and illustrator, independent filmmaker Michael Maglaras of 217 Films produced a film titled \"O Brother Man: The Art and Life of Lynd Ward.\" The documentary features an interview with the artist's daughter Robin Ward Savage, as well as more than 150 works from all periods of Ward's career. The 94-minute documentary, culled from over seven hours of film and narrated by Maglaras, premiered at Penn State University Library's, Foster Auditorium, on April 20, 2012, where it was warmly received. Penn State's Special Collections Library has also become the repository for much Lynd Ward material, and may continue to receive material from Ward family collections.\n\nHe won a number of awards, including a Library of Congress Award for wood engraving, the Caldecott Medal for \"The Biggest Bear\" in 1953 (with a runner-up for \"America's Ethan Allen\" in 1950), and a Rutgers University award for Distinguished Contribution to Children's Literature. He also illustrated two Newbery Medal books and six runners-up. In 2011, Ward was listed as a Judges' Choice for The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame.\n\nWard is known for his wordless novels told entirely through dramatic wood engravings. Ward's first work, (1929), uses a blend of Art Deco and Expressionist styles to tell the story of an artist's struggle with his craft, his seduction and subsequent abuse by money and power, his escape to innocence, and his unavoidable doom. Ward, in employing the concept of the wordless pictorial narrative, acknowledged as his predecessors the European artists Frans Masereel and Otto Nückel. Released the week of the 1929 stock market crash, would continue to exert influence well beyond the Depression era, becoming an important source of inspiration for Beat Generation poet Allen Ginsberg.\n\nWard produced six wood engraving novels over the next eight years, including:\n\n\nWard left one more wordless novel partially completed at the time of his death in 1985. The 26 completed wood engravings (out of a planned total of 44) were published in a limited edition in 2001, under the title \"Lynd Ward's Last, Unfinished, Wordless Novel\".\n\nIn 1930 Ward's wood engravings were used to illustrate Alec Waugh's travel book \"Hot Countries\"; in 1936 an edition of Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" was published with illustrations by Ward. Ward illustrated the 1942 children's book \"The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge\", with text by Hildegarde Swift. His work on children's books also included his 1953 Caldecott Medal winning book \"The Biggest Bear\", \"Nic of the Woods\" from 1965 which he wrote and illustrated, and his work on Esther Forbes' \"Johnny Tremain\". He also produced a wordless story for children, \"The Silver Pony\", which is told entirely in black, white and shades of gray painted illustrations; it was published in 1973.\n\nWard's work included an awareness of the racial injustice to be found in the United States. This is first apparent in the lynching scenes from \"Wild Pilgrimage\" and appears again in his drawings for \"North Star Shining: A Pictorial History of the American Negro\", by Hildegarde Hoyt Swift, published in 1947. Ward uses African American characters, as well as several different Native ones, in his book \"The Silver Pony\".\n\nWard also illustrated \"Little Baptiste\", \"My Friend Mac\" and \"The Wolf of Lamb's Lane\" which were all written by his wife, May McNeer.\n\nIn 1941 his illustrations were used in \"Great Ghost Stories of the World: The Haunted Omnibus\", edited by Alexander Laing.\n\nIn 1974 Harry N. Abrams published \"Storyteller Without Words\", a book that included Ward's six novels plus an assortment of his illustrations from other books. Ward himself broke his silence and wrote brief prologues to each of his works. In 2010, the Library of America published \"Lynd Ward: Six Novels in Woodcuts\", with a new chronology of Ward's life and an introduction by Art Spiegelman.\n\nWard's work had an important influence on the work of later graphic artists such as George Walker, Clifford Harper, Eric Drooker, Jarrett Heckbert, Steven McCabe and Megan Speers.\n\nSince 2011, Ward has been honored and his name has been attached to the prestigious annual Lynd Ward Graphic Novel Prize, which is sponsored by Penn State University Libraries and administered by the Pennsylvania Center for the Book, an affiliate of the Center for the Book at the Library of Congress. Previous winners of the Lynd Ward Prize have been Nick Sousanis, Jillian Tamaki, Mariko Tamaki, Jim Woodring, Chris Ware, Anders Nilsen, and Adam Hines.\n\n\n\n"}

It is also known as the Afghan fox, royal fox, dog fox, hoary fox, steppe fox, black fox, king fox (), cliff fox or Baluchistan fox.\n\nThe specific name, \"cana\", is Latin for \"hoary\" (so the scientific name means \"hoary fox\", corresponding to one of the vernacular names of the species).\n\nBlanford's fox inhabits semiarid regions, steppes, and mountains of Afghanistan, Egypt (Sinai), Turkestan, northeast Iran, southwest Pakistan, the West Bank, and Israel. It may also live throughout Arabia (particularly Oman, Yemen, and Jordan), as one was trapped in Dhofari region of Oman in 1984. Recent camera trapping surveys have confirmed the presence of the species in several places in the mountains of South Sinai, Egypt, the mountains of Ras Al Khaimah and Jebel Hafeet in the UAE, and in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBlanford's fox possesses hairless footpads and cat-like, curved, sharp claws described by some authors as semiretractile.\n\nThis fox has an ability to climb rocks and make jumps described as \"astonishing\", jumping to ledges above them with ease, and as part of their regular movements and climbing vertical, crumbling cliffs by a series of jumps up vertical sections. The foxes use their sharp, curved claws and naked footpads for traction on narrow ledges and their long, bushy tails as a counterbalance.\n\nLike all desert foxes, the Blanford's fox has large ears which enables it to dissipate heat. However, unlike other desert foxes, it does not have pads covered with hair, which would otherwise protect its paws from hot sand. Its tail is almost equal in length to its body. Its coat is light tan, with white underparts and a black tip on the tail. Among all extant canids, only the fennec fox is smaller than Blanford's.\n\nOmnivorous, and more frugivorous than other foxes. It prefers seedless grapes, ripe melons and Russian chives when consuming domestic crops. In addition, it eats insects. The Biblical foxes in the vineyard mentioned in the Song of Songs 2:15, described as \"little foxex who roun the vineyards\" are most probably the frugivorous Blanford's foxes.\n\n\nWhile the IUCN has downgraded Blanford's fox to \"least concern\" as more has been learned about the breadth of its distribution across the Middle East, very little is known about this species and its vulnerabilities to the diseases of domesticated dogs that have so badly affected other canids. Currently, little competition exists with humans for habitat, and the fox is a protected species in Israel and protected from hunting in Oman and Yemen. Some fur hunting occurs in Afghanistan, and occasionally they may take poison intended for hyenas and other species.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2115831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2115831", "title": "Vaison-la-Romaine", "text": "Vaison-la-Romaine\n\nVaison-la-Romaine is a town in the Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in southeastern France.\n\nVaison-la-Romaine is famous for its rich Roman ruins and mediaeval town and cathedral. It is also unusual in the way the antique, mediaeval and modern towns spanning 2,000 years of history lie close together.\n\nThe old town is split into two parts: the \"upper city\" or \"Colline du Château\" on a hill on one side of the Ouvèze, and on the opposite bank, the \"lower city\" centred on the \"Colline de la Villasse\".\n\nWith four theatres and numerous exhibitions and galleries, Vaison-la-Romaine is also renowned for its art scene. Many writers, painters and actors live in the area.\nThe area was inhabited in the Bronze Age. At the end of the fourth century BC Vaison became the capital of a Celtic tribe, the Vocontii, centred on the oppidum in the upper city.\n\nAfter the Roman conquest (125-118 BC) in the wars against the Salyes, the Vocontii retained a certain degree of autonomy; they had two capitals, Luc-en-Diois, apparently the religious centre, and Vaison which was named \"Vasio Julia Vocontiorum\". Their authority continued in the gradual Romanisation of the Celtic \"oppidum\". Early building was probably done by Vocontian aristocrats who moved down from the \"oppidum\" and established houses along the river, around which the city eventually accreted but based on a Roman orthogonal street plan with different alignment from the earlier houses.\n\nConstruction of large public monuments began in the second half of the 1st century: theatre, bridge, aqueducts, thermal baths. Two aqueducts provided water to the city; the older one had its source on the Sainte-Croix hill to the north, while the longer one's source was at the Groseau spring on Mont Ventoux 10km to the south-east.\n\nThe Pax Romana led to the extension of the city which was at its finest in the second century when it covered up to 75 hectares. It became one of the richest of Gallia Narbonensis; many houses with numerous mosaic pavements have been discovered and there is a fine theatre on a rocky hillslope, probably built during the reign of Tiberius, whose statue was found in a prominent place on site. The beautiful statue, the \"Vaison Diadumenos\", (now in the British Museum) was also discovered in the theatre in the nineteenth century.\n\nThe barbarian invasions were presaged by pillaging and burning in 276, from which Roman Vasio recovered. Vaison became a relatively important Christian religious centre (a bishopric existed there from the 4th century) where two councils met in 442 and 529.\n\nThe barbaric invasions of the 5th century by the Burgundians ruined the city. The theatre's benches began to be reused as Christian tombstones. Vaison was taken by the Ostrogoths in 527 then by Chlothar I, King of the Franks, in 545 and became part of Provence.\n\nThe disputes which broke out in the twelfth century between the counts of Provence, who had refortified the ancient \"upper town\" and the bishops, each of whom were in possession of half the town, were injurious to its prosperity; they were ended by a treaty negotiated in 1251 by the future pope Clement IV, a native of Saint-Gilles-du-Gard.\n\nIn disturbed times of the Middle Ages, the inhabitants migrated to higher ground on the left bank of Ouvèze, with the shelter of the ramparts and a strong castle. From the eighteenth century, most of the population moved back down to the plains by the river.\n\nA flood struck Vaison-la-Romaine on 22 September 1992, the worst since 1632.\n\nThe Roman ruins lie in the valley on the banks of the river Ouvèze which is crossed by a Roman bridge from the 1st century AD. The Roman ruins are located in two main areas: La Villasse and Puymin.\n\nSeveral large and rich town houses have been excavated:\n\nThe houses must have belonged to the Vocontii aristocracy who owned estates in the region.\n\nA large number of finds originating from Vaison-la-Romaine are now dispersed among 25 museums worldwide, mostly in Europe and North America.\n\nThe mediaeval town is high on the rocky hill as attacks were frequent and the town retreated to a more defensible position.\n\nThe apse of the Church of St. Quenin, dedicated to Saint Quinidius, seems to date from the eighth century, one of the oldest in France. The cathedral dates from the 11th century, but the apse and the apsidal chapels are from the Merovingian period.\n\nThe town also has a famous open air market held on Tuesdays year round.\n\nThe Dolphin House owes its name to a white marble fountainhead portraying a cupid riding a dolphin. The structure\nof the house indicates it was built in stages over a period of about 250 years. About 30 BC it was a farmhouse of area 1,400 m2 built on a different alignment to the later street grid and with main entrance to the south. The main building consisted of four rooms arranged around a colonnaded courtyard (\"peristyle\"). To the west lay several agricultural outbuildings and a small heated building, probably a thermal bath. 50 years later, water and sewage pipes were added leading to greatly improved living standards. Around 80 AD, the house was extended over the strip of land up to the new pedestrian street. A new main entrance was built to the north, the peristyle was extended eastwards and adorned with a pond and the upper ﬂoor was enlarged.\n\nThe private section of the house consists of rooms arranged around the peristyle, including the upper floor accessed by the staircase next to the \"tablinum\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was published in 1991, a few months after Dahl's death in November 1990, and is the author's final contribution to literature after an illustrious career spanning almost half a century. The book was republished in 2017 under the title Billy and the Minpins with new illustrations by traditional Dahl illustrator Quentin Blake.\n\nLittle Billy is forbidden by his mother to do a lot of things, including entering the Forest of Sin behind his house. She tells him of the Whangdoodle, Hornswogglers, Snozzwanglers and Vermicious knids that live in the forest. Worst of all is the Terrible Blood-Suckling Tooth-Pluckling Stone-Chuckling Spittler, who chases his prey while clouds of hot red smoke pour out of his nose, and then swallows them up in one gulp. Little Billy doesn't believe his mother, and the Devil whispers to Little Billy that the monsters don't exist, and there is a plethora of luscious wild strawberries in the forest. Soon, Little Billy is walking through the forest when he hears something coming after him, and runs to escape it. As he looks back, he sees puffs of orange-red smoke catching up with him. \n\nHe escapes what he is sure must be the Spittler by climbing up a tree as high and as fast as he can. When he comes to rest, he notices windows opening all over the branches, and discovers a whole city of little people, the Minpins, living inside the tree. The leader of the Minpins, Don Mini, tells Little Billy that the monster waiting under the tree is not the Spittler (which the Minpins have never heard of), but the Red-Hot Smoke-Belching Gruncher, who grunches up everything in the forest. It seems that there is no way for Little Billy to safely get down from the tree and return home. \n\nBut upon learning of the close friendship between the Minpins and birds, Little Billy devises a plan to rid the forest of the Gruncher: Little Billy flies on the back of a swan and uses his scent to lure the Gruncher into a lake. The water of the lake puts out the fire in the Gruncher's belly, killing him. The Minpins are grateful to Little Billy for ridding the forest of their tormentor. They reward him by sending the swan to serve as Little Billy's own personal transport every night, which he uses to explore the world and to continue his newfound friendship with the Minpins.\n"}
{"id": "2115847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2115847", "title": "Aratus of Sicyon", "text": "Aratus of Sicyon\n\nAratus of Sicyon (Ancient Greek: Ἄρατος ὁ Σικυώνιος; 271–213 BC) was a politician and military commander of Hellenistic Greece. He was elected strategos of the Achaean League 17 times, leading the League through numerous military campaigns including the Cleomenean War and the Social War.\n\nAratus was exiled to Argos at the age of seven, after his father, the magistrate of Sicyon, was killed in a coup. In 251 BC, he led an expedition composed of other exiles which freed Sicyon from tyranny, and assumed power in the city. Sicyon joined the Achaean League, in which Aratus would later be elected \"strategos\". In his first major campaign as strategos, he seized the Macedonian-held citadel of Acrocorinth, previously believed impregnable.\n\nAfter conquering the Acrocorinth, Aratus pursued the Achaean League's expansion. When the Spartan king Cleomenes III conquered the Achaean cities of Argos and Corinth, Aratus succeeded in securing an alliance with his erstwhile enemy, Macedon. Cleomenes III was defeated at the Battle of Sellasia by the joint forces of the Achaean League and Antigonus III Doson, the regent of Macedon. During the Social War against the Aetolian League, Aratus became one of the prime advisors of the new king of Macedon, Philip V. Aratus died in 213 BC, allegedly poisoned by Philip.\n\nAratus was born in 271 BC in the northern Peloponnese city-state of Sicyon. His father, Cleinias of Sicyon, had become head magistrate of the city jointly with Timocleidas after the murder of the previous tyrant. Shortly after government stabilised, Timocleidas died. In 264 BC, Abantidas murdered Cleinias, and proclaimed himself tyrant. The seven-year-old Aratus escaped the coup with the help of his aunt who, in the confusion, was able to hide the boy until nightfall and then smuggle him out of Sicyon to Argos. He was raised in Argos by friends of his father, living there until 251 BC.\n\nIn Argos, Aratus initially became known as a good athlete, winning a prize in the pentathlon. But he remained focused on the idea of freeing his home city's from tyranny. Despite his youth, he was able to gain widespread support among fellow exiles, becoming the leader of the exiles' party.\n\nIn Sicyon, Abantidas was killed by two philosophers. Abantidas was replaced by his own father, who was subsequently killed and replaced by Nicocles. Aratus began to seek support from the kings of Macedon and Egypt. Plutarch reports that Nicocles' main cause of concern about Aratus was the younger man's elevated connections.\n\nIn 251 BC, Aratus had originally intended to take and hold a fortified post near Sicyon from which he could raid his enemies' property, and where sympathisers could join him. But a political prisoner recently escaped from the tyrant's prison in Sicyon suggested a better plan, saying that the escape route he had taken out of Sicyon could easily be used by men with ladders to get back into the city by scaling its defensive walls.\n\nAratus armed his men in secret. To mislead the tyrant's spies at Argos, he pretended to feast on the day of his planned coup. Once the spies had gone, Aratus joined his men waiting outside the city and led them to Sicyon, aiming to reach and scale the city walls while the light was still low. They were almost given away by the city's watchdogs, but the guards failed to recognise the danger. At dawn, the intruders took the barracks guards prisoner. The tyrant, Nicocles, managed to escape through a tunnel. Rumours of the attack spread fast across the city, and some of the citizens set fire to the tyrant's house. Aratus did not intervene to stop the looting, allowing citizens free rein after thirteen years of tyranny.\n\nAratus' first act after taking Sicyon was to call back its exiles. According to Plutarch, he recalled 80 who had been banished by Nicocles, and a further 500 besides them. The returning exiles sought to reclaim their confiscated property, and civil war threatened. Plutarch reports that one of the two kings Aratus had earlier petitioned for support gave him 25 talents of silver as a personal gift and goodwill gesture. It is not clear whether this was Antigonus Gonatas, the king of Macedon, or Ptolemy II Philadelphos, the pharaoh of Egypt. Antigonus probably hoped that Aratus would prove a useful Macedonian puppet in the Peloponnese. Ptolemy had just won Corinth from the Macedonian empire, and would have liked to increase his success. Aratus gave the money away to his fellow citizens and, probably also in 251 BC, decided to attach Sicyon to the Achaean League. It was the first time the League had admitted a non-Achaean \"polis\" (Sicyon was Dorian).\n\nBut Sicyon had become economically unstable. Aratus could now no longer rely for help on an alliance with Macedon's Antigonus, as the Achaean League was a rival of Macedon in Greece. He was left little choice but to turn to Ptolemy II Philadelphus in Egypt. Plutarch recounts the events of his journey to the court at Alexandria, from which he returned with 40 talents and the promise of another 110. Back in Sicyon, Aratus did not want sole responsibility for distributing the money, and established a committee which included himself and fifteen other members for the task. The funds received from Ptolemy II enabled Aratus to resolve the political problems in Sicyon. Grateful citizens erected a bronze statue to honour him. Events during the rest of the period between 251 and 245 BC remain obscure, although it is known that Aratus served for four or five years as a cavalryman in the Achaean militia.\n\nIn 245 BC, Aratus was elected \"strategos\" of the Achaean League. He went on to hold this position every two years until his death, with only a few interruptions. Aratus' career was marked by the expansion of the League. His first known act as \"strategos\" was to pillage the countryside of Locris and Calydon. He also led a 10,000-strong army to help the Boeotians against the Aetolian League.\n\nIn his second term, Aratus focused on capturing the Acrocorinth, the acropolis of Corinth. The city of Corinth controlled entry to the Peloponnese, and was an important trading post. The Acrocorinth was a formidable fortress, built on a hill nearly high. It had a freshwater source, was surrounded by cliffs, and was capped by a massive, walled citadel. Antigonus Gonatas controlled the Acrocorinth with a strong garrison under his commander Persaeus. In 243 BC, Aratus learned from Syrian mercenaries that there was a less steep access route to the hill, where the wall was also at its lowest point. By midsummer that year, Aratus was ready to attack the Acrocorinth.\n\nAratus assembled his army in Sicyon. The majority waited on the road between Sicyon and the Acrocorinth, while Aratus himself went to the city with a select force of 400 men. Eight were sent forward to overwhelm the guards before 100 soldiers scaled the walls with ladders. Each was barefoot to minimise noise. They encountered a group of guards on entering the city, and killed three. But a fourth escaped and raised the alarm. Aratus and his soldiers got as far as the citadel itself, attempting to scale its walls as defenders hurled projectiles down on them. In the meantime, 300 more soldiers had scaled the outer walls, but then struggled to find Aratus inside the city. The waiting Achaean army below was at risk of being trapped between the citadel's defenders and a group of Macedonian soldiers arriving from the city, but was saved by those 300 soldiers, who were able to attack and rout the Macedonians from behind. The 300 men then went back to support their commander at the citadel. Weather conditions proved favourable for Aratus:\n\nAratus' soldiers scaled the walls of the citadel and the garrison surrendered. By dawn, the Achaeans held both citadel and city, in a victory owing partly to luck but also to good planning and nerve. The storming of the near-impregnable Acrocorinth was another major accomplishment for Aratus, following his taking of Sicyon. Very few achieved the feat; among those who did was Demetrius I, \"the Besieger\". Aratus went on to capture Lechaeum, the harbour of Corinth, and secure the 25 Macedonian warships docked there. He garrisoned the captured citadel with 400 Achaeans and 50 watchdogs.\n\nAfter its capture by Aratus, Corinth also joined the Achaean League. It was followed shortly afterwards by Megara, Troezen, and Epidaurus. The Achaean League gained more renown when Ptolemy III Euergetes, the new king of Egypt, was elected \"hegemon\". Both the League and rival Macedon then sought new allies. The Macedonian king Antigonus chose the Aetolian League, which had ambitions of working with him to defeat the Achaean League and then share out the conquered territory. The Achaean League allied with Sparta, one of the most powerful \"poleis\" of Greece.\n\nIn 241 BC, during Aratus' third term as \"strategos\", the Aetolian League invaded the Peloponnese. Aratus and the Spartan king, Agis IV, agreed to defend the Isthmus of Corinth together, but disagreed on strategy. Agis IV wanted to defeat the Aetolians in a pitched battle. But Aratus wanted to avoid immediate fighting, on the grounds that the Aetolians could only cause limited damage at that time as crops had already been harvested and stored. It is unclear whether this reasoning truly reflected Aratus' thinking, or whether he regretted his alliance with Sparta. It has also been suggested that this was one of the episodes of Aratus' life in which he lost his nerve in military matters.\n\nThe Spartan army returned home, ending the alliance. The impact was immediately felt. The front line could no longer be held, allowing the Aetolians to invade the Peloponnese and capture Pellene, one of the first members of the Achaean League. In response, Aratus marched on the Aetolians with the soldiers he had available, finding them in disarray and routing them easily.\n\nBy 240 BC it had become clear to Antigonus that the Aetolians might not be ideal allies, and he sued for peace with the Achaeans. This peace did not last. The 80-year-old king died the following year, and was succeeded by his son Demetrius II.\n\nAfter the death of Antigonus, the Achaean and Aetolian Leagues allied with each other. The reason behind this alliance remains obscure, and the alliance itself only lasted ten years. Aratus maintained his focus on expanding the Achaean League, by \"liberating even more cities in Greece from tyranny\". Those cities Included Argos, Athens, and Megalopolis. In Argos, the citizens had already had plans to rise against the tyrant, but lacked sufficient weaponry. Aratus assisted them, smuggling a shipment of weapons into the city. The shipment was intercepted and the coup failed. Aratus led an attack close to the city afterwards, but the citizens were reluctant to join him.\n\nAratus remained determined to liberate Argos. In 235 BC he made another attempt, and succeeded in entering the city by attacking at night. But the Argives were once again reluctant to support him, leaving the Achaeans to fight alone. Aratus was wounded in the thigh by a spear. He ordered a retreat, but the timing was unfortunate. The retreat emboldened the tyrant, Aristippus of Argos, who had been preparing to flee the city. Instead, he held his ground and prepared for battle.\n\nThe Battle of the river Xerias was a classic clash between two phalanxes. As was not uncommon in Greek warfare, the battle was decided on the wings, where the Achaeans routed the enemy flank. But Aratus, leading the other wing, was injured, and he pulled back. To the outrage of the Achaeans on the victorious wing, this allowed Aristippus to claim victory. The next day, after lining up his army again for battle, Aratus decided to retreat on seeing that the enemy had gained numerical superiority through reinforcements.\n\nAratus proposed a truce, which Aristippus accepted. Despite this truce, Aratus took the city of Cleonae, controlled by Aristippus. There, he celebrated the Nemean Games, and sold into slavery every Argive found. On hearing of Aristippus' determination to win back Cleonae, Aratus, who was then near Corinth, immediately mobilised a new army, probably by levying volunteers. The Argives feared Achaean intervention and did not dare attack Cleonae, but Aratus did not want to wait longer, and decided on a ploy to lure them. He returned and entered Cleonae before the Argives reached it, then sallied forth the following morning, surprising and routing the Argive army. Aristippus was killed, together with 1,500 other soldiers. It was reported that the Achaeans lost no soldiers at all. And still the victory did not bring the desired result. Aristippus' brother Aristomachus returned to Argos and appointed himself as the new tyrant.\n\nThe city of Megalopolis was founded in 371 BC by the Theban general Epaminondas as a stronghold against Sparta. Until 235 BC, its tyrant, Lydiades, had tried to maintain good relationships with Macedon. That year, on becoming aware of Aratus' expansionist plans in the Peloponnese; the death of Aristippus; and events in Sparta, Lydiades decided to give up his power by joining the Achaean League. This apparently unselfish deed had important consequences, as Orchomenus and Mantinea soon followed suit. In 236 BC, Lydiades was elected \"strategos\", the first of his three terms. The event also marked the beginning of a tradition of Megapolitan \"strategoi\" in the League, most notably Philopoemen.\n\nThe Achaean League became a significant power through the efforts of Aratus; a mighty confederation with an organised army financed by tax revenue, controlling all of the northern Peloponnese.\n\nRealising that the Achaean League had become a major player in Greece with the incorporation of Megalopolis, Demetrius II, the new king of Macedon, decided to take action. In 233 BC, he sent an army to the Peloponnese commanded by a general Bithys. They defeated the Achaeans near Phylacia, probably close to Tegea, although the details of the battle are unknown. Aratus apparently succeeded in escaping the battlefield and reaching Corinth, but reports began to spread that he had been killed or taken prisoner. According to Plutarch, this news was enthusiastically received in Athens. Plutarch's tendency to exaggerate notwithstanding, it seems true that the Athenians had no great liking for Aratus despite his wish to liberate the city from Macedonian rule.\n\nA letter was sent to Corinth saying that the Achaean troops had to leave the city. Aratus himself received the letter, but sent the couriers on their way. Plutarch also reports, confusingly, that Aratus was a prisoner on a Macedonian boat carrying him back to Corinth. While this information is contradictory and cannot be entirely correct, the outcome was the same: Aratus organised a punitive expedition into Attica, but turned back before reaching the walls of Athens. The reasons are unclear. His army may have been defeated; or he may have returned to the Peloponnese as he knew that Bithys' army was approaching from the south on its way back to Macedon. Macedon's King Demetrius was later killed in battle against invading Celtic tribes.\n\nAthens, having received reports of the king's death, decided it was now in a good position to expel the weakened Macedonian garrison. Although Aratus was sick at that time, and was not the current \"strategos\" of the Achaean League, he hurried to Athens' aid. Aratus persuaded the commander of the Macedonian garrison, Diogenes, to surrender Piraeus, Munychia, Salamis, and Sunium to Athens in exchange for 150 talents, twenty of which Aratus paid himself. Diogenes left Athens with his troops. For the first time since 294 BC, the city was again self-governing. Nevertheless, Athens refused the invitation to join the Achaean League.\n\nAristomachus of Argos, Macedon's only remaining ally in the Peloponnese, bowed to force majeure and finally joined the Achaean League. The following year, 228 BC, he was elected \"strategos\". That the same year, the alliance between the Achaeans and the Aetolians broke, the only surprise being it had lasted ten years. After Demetrius' death, Antigonus III Doson became regent for the child-king Philip V of Macedon. He secured the northern frontier of his kingdom, and concluded a treaty with the Aetolians in about 228 BC.\n\nIn 229 BC, Cleomenes III of Sparta took three Arcadian cities from the Aetolian League: Tegea, Orchomenus, and Mantinea. It is unclear why the Aetolian League tolerated this move. The Achaean League did not like this development, because of the cities' strategic importance.\n\nThe ephors urged Cleomenes also to take the \"Athenaeum\", a fortress on the road between Sparta and Arcadia. The fortress belonged both to Megalopolis and to the Achaean League. The Achaean League saw this move by Sparta as a declaration of war. Aratus, again \"strategos\", tried to organise nightly attacks to regain control of Tegea and Orchomenus, but was betrayed by his partisans in both cities, who told Cleomenes of the plan.\n\nThe ephors called Cleomenes back to Sparta, probably seeking to avoid all-out war. It was too late. With Cleomenes absent, Aratus took Caphyae. Cleomenes was dispatched once more and took a small Arcadian settlement. In 227 BC, the Achaean army marched out with 20,000 infantry, accompanied by another 1,000 infantry under Aristomachus, to defeat Cleomenes in a pitched battle. The Spartans had only 5,000 men, but their reputation still inspired fear in other Greeks. Aratus persuaded Aristomachus to pull back, which displeased Lydiades, the former tyrant of Megalopolis. Tensions were evident within the expanded Achaean League.\n\nThe following year, in 226 BC, Aratus' army was defeated near Mount Lycaeum in Arcadia. The circumstances of the battle are unclear, but Achaean losses were heavy. Aratus was still able to turn this incident to his advantage, as it allowed him to march in secret to Mantinea and take that city. Importantly, this opened up the route from Argos to Megalopolis. From Mantinea, Aratus marched on to besiege Orchomenus. But Cleomenes marched for Megalopolis, capturing the fortress of Leuctra, 10 km from the city. Aratus came to the aid of the Megalopolitans, and was able to drive the Spartans back, but then failed to capitalise on his victory as the Spartans were able to fall back to a position of strength. Lydiades, furious, launched a cavalry attack on the newly organised Spartan troops, but Aratus did not follow and Lydiades was defeated and killed. The Spartans regained courage from this success, and attacked and routed the entire Achaean army.\n\nThe defeat brought scorn on Aratus. An Achaean assembly voted to stop funding him. Aratus resolved to resign the office of general, but rethought and stayed on, again displaying his resilience. He marched with an Achaean army to Orchomenus, there defeating a Spartan army commanded by Cleomenes' father-in-law, who was captured and then quickly ransomed.\n\nIn 226 BC, Cleomenes conquered Mantinea, Tegea and Pharae. He succeeded in luring the Achaeans into open battle in the fall of 226 BC. Details of the engagement are not known, but the reformed Spartan army, now armed in the Macedonian style, won a decisive victory. The Achaeans sued for peace, and were rejected. Aratus began negotiating an alliance between Macedon and the Achaean League, but Macedon demanded the return of the Acrocorinth in return for intervening. The Achaeans were not prepared to give up the citadel, and negotiations broke down.\n\nIn 225 BC, Cleomenes attacked Achaean territory again, aiming to take Aratus' home city, Sicyon. He hoped this would provoke the collapse of the entire Achaean League, as tensions within the League were already running high over Aratus' Macedonian strategy. If Sicyon fell, Aratus would no longer be part of the Achaean League. The plan to take Sicyon failed, but Cleomenes did conquer Pellene, Pheneus, Penteleum, and later Agros. The Argives, never the most enthusiastic members of the Achaean League, decided to ally with Sparta. Many authors see in this the hand of Aristomachus, former tyrant of the city. Aratus was given plenipotentiary powers to deal with the crisis. He marched to Corinth, arriving to face an angry mob: the population had heard of his intention to surrender the city and its citadel to Antigonus. Aratus only narrowly escaped. The Corinthians offered to surrender the city to Cleomenes, even while the Acrocorinth was still held by an Achaean garrison. Cleomenes marched towards Corinth, taking many other cities in Argolis on his way. After laying siege to the Acrocorinth, Cleomenes proposed a peace treaty to Aratus, who refused. The Spartan king went on to besiege Sicyon, pillaging the surrounding countryside.\n\nShortly before the start of the siege, the Achaean council members decided to accept Macedon's war conditions after all. Aratus sent his son to Macedon as a hostage. Antigonus was ready with an army of 20,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry. When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian intervention, he abandoned the siege of Sicyon as fast as possible, moving to the Isthmus of Corinth, a better position from which to meet the northern threat. Aratus went to meet the Macedonian king near Pagae:\n\nBoth hard-headed realists, Aratus and Antigonus got along well despite their wariness. Plutarch reports that at one point, during a banquet, they even shared a blanket to keep warm.\n\nCleomenes' defensive front near the Isthmus of Corinth proved very effective. It took Antigonus a long time to overcome it, and he lost men while trying to break through near Lechaeum. Later, a delegation from Argos asked Aratus to liberate their city from the Spartans, as Cleomenes had failed to deliver on his promises. Aratus sailed to Epidaurus with 1,500 troops to attack Argos, but found that it had fallen already to an internal uprising with the help of Timoxenos, then \"strategos\" of the Achaean League. Sparta was left almost undefended. Cleomenes was forced to return to Sparta as a result, and leave his defences near the Isthmus. This allowed Antigonus to enter the Peloponnese, where he occupied the Acrocorinth and put a garrison in the city.\n\nIn 224 BC, while Antigonus was liberating the occupied cities in the Peloponnese, Cleomenes was reinforcing his army. The winter of 223 BC saw Cleomenes feign a march to Tegea, but then turn for Megalopolis, where he took the city by surprise. Around a thousand citizens escaped, finding shelter in Messene. Megalopolis itself was pillaged. Aratus reportedly wept while reporting this news to the Achaean council. Antigonus recalled his troops from winter quarters, but soon realised there was insufficient time. Cleomenes, emboldened, marched on Argos, pillaging the countryside in the hope that the population would be enraged by Antigonus' lack of action. But ultimately, Cleomenes' acts served only to antagonise the inhabitants of the Peloponnese.\n\nAntigonus was able to rally his army, now numbering some 27,600 infantry and 1,200 cavalry. Cleomenes occupied the pass near Sellasia, before Sparta, to stop the Macedonian king. But he was defeated at the Battle of Sellasia in July 222 BC, and fled to Egypt. Antigonus conquered Sparta, but treated the city leniently and left again some days later.\n\nIn 221 BC, the Aetolians began pillaging the territory of Messenia. In 220 BC, the council of the Achaean League met in Aegium to discuss the city of Messene's request for their help. Most council members did not want to attack the Aetolians, but Aratus was able to persuade them. He began to raise an army near Megalopolis, with the aim of trapping the Aetolians as they returned to their ships to sail home. But the Aetolian commander was able to evade the threat. It seemed there would be no decisive confrontation, until the Achaean commanders made a crucial mistake and Aratus sent a cavalry unit against the Aetolians:\n\nThe cavalry had to fight on rough terrain, where the Aetolians were greatly superior. Aratus then abandoned his favourable position to go to his cavalry's aid. The rest of the Aetolian force seized the advantage, charging from high ground to rout the Achaeans. After the battle, the Aetolians continued pillaging, and also raided Sicyon. They returned to Aetolia via the Isthmus of Corinth, adding insult to the injury of the Achaeans' failure to protect their own.\n\nAs both sides were then trying to find new allies, the Achaean League turned again to Macedon. But the new Macedonian king, Philip V, was not keen on war with the Aetolians. Ultimately, the Achaeans did convince Philip, and Boeotia, Acarnania, and Epirus also joined the alliance. The Aetolians allied with Sparta and Elis, and in 219 BC again invaded Achaean League territory. This invasion attempt was put down near Aegeira, but it was not a decisive defeat.\n\nIn the meantime, Philip was preparing his army in Macedon. He won several victories in 218 BC, but his army mutinied and he returned to Macedon for the winter. Philip was assisted by Aratus and several other advisors, of whom Apelles was the most important. Aratus had become very influential, and is considered to have been a true friend of the king. Apelles, in contrast, remained resolutely Macedonian, still wanting to incorporate Achaea into the Kingdom of Macedon. Apelles began to oppose the Achaeans in the allied army, for example by demoting several Achaean officers. He also opposed Aratus by supporting his opponent, Eperatus, in the election of a new \"strategos\". He tried, and failed, to impeach Aratus by ruse. The relationship between Apelles and the Macedonian king appears to have worsened as a result, and Aratus became Philip's most important advisor. Aratus quickly gained a reputation for his skill, but this increased the other officers’ envy. They began to insult him openly during their banquets, even throwing stones. The king was furious, and ordered those responsible put to death.\n\nAfter Macedon's intervention in the war, the Aetolians faced more difficulties on all fronts. They continued their pillaging, but were frequently ambushed. Ultimately they sued for peace, concluded in 217 BC.\n\nAfter the Social War, Philip caused a civil war in Messene, and possibly kept Aratus out of the matter deliberately. Unhappy, Aratus ordered the king to suppress the unrest. Philip was angry, but taken aback at his vehemence, and accepted the rebuke.\n\nMeanwhile, the First Macedonian War between Macedon and Rome had erupted. In 214 BC, the Romans defeated Philip near the town of Oricum in Illyria. The same year, Philip returned to Messene, which he attacked for reasons that remain unclear. Aratus had already given his opinion of Philip's deeds near Messene, and did so again, also refusing to support Philip's campaigns in Illyria.\n\nAratus's health deteriorated rapidly during this period, and he died in 213 BC. As tensions had been high between the king and the \"strategos\", there were inevitable rumours of foul play. According to Plutarch, Philip had Aratus poisoned. He reports that Aratus knew what was happening, but could only confide this information to his manservant:\n\nAccording to modern scholarship, this dramatic version of events, fitting the \"topos\" of the ungrateful prince, is unlikely. Philip had no interest in an unstable Achaea. Aratus remained useful, despite having asked some difficult questions of Philip in the recent past, and it is difficult to imagine Philip wanting him eliminated. Had there been substance to the rumours, much public comment on the great man's murder by the king of Macedon would be expected.\n\nBy special permission of the Oracle of Delphi, Aratus was the first person to be buried within the city walls of Sicyon as 'founder and saviour of the city'.\n\nAratus was elected \"strategos\" of the Achaean League seventeen times. Under his leadership the Achaean League became a major player in Greece, thanks principally to his military victories rather to any great skill as a tactician. Reportedly, his nerves would get the better of him at critical moments during battle. Plutarch reports that Aratus was a great politician, but that his capacities did not extend to the battlefield, saying: \"the general of the Achaeans always had cramps in the bowels when a battle was imminent\". But it seems Aratus was a master of the surprise attack, although details of these battles remain obscure.\n\nWhat Aratus lacked as a tactician, he made up for as a politician. He was very good at compromise, as when he surrendered the hard-earned Acrocorinth to Macedon when he needed Macedon's help against Sparta. He could also display great patience. When he brought Sicyon into the Achaean League, for example, Aratus knew that he was too young to be elected \"strategos\". This did not stop him from ultimately achieving that goal.\n\nAratus became the most important person within the Achaean League, but it grew progressively more difficult for him to get his way as a succession of other mighty city-states joined. Although it is unlikely that Aratus was poisoned, his death was certainly linked with the final stage of Philip's transition from beloved young prince to what Plutarch described as an impious despot richly deserving of downfall.\n\nAratus wrote his memoirs, now lost. Plutarch and Polybius both acknowledge using it extensively as a source. Polybius states that he is covering Aratus \"quite summarily, as he published a truthful and clearly written memoir of his career\". The information concerning Aratus is therefore to be read through a critical filter, allowing for the possibility that he may have wanted to attenuate his own mistakes by blaming others, or that he glorified his own victories.\n\n\n"}

The title was first used in the 16th century for Hafsa Sultan (died 1534), consort of Selim I () and mother of Suleiman the Magnificent (), superseding the previous title of \"mehd-i ulya\" (\"cradle of the great\").\nNormally, the living mother of a reigning sultan held this title. Those mothers who died before their sons' accession to the throne were never bestowed with the title of Valide Sultan. In special cases, grandmothers and stepmothers of a reigning sultan assumed the title \"Valide Sultan\".\n\nThe word \"valide\" (والده) literally means \"mother\" in Ottoman Turkish, from Arabic. The Turkish pronunciation of the word \"valide\" is .\n\nSultan (سلطان) is an Arabic word originally meaning \"authority\" or \"dominion\". By the beginning of the 16th century, this title, carried by both men and women of the Ottoman dynasty, was replacing other titles by which prominent members of the imperial family had been known (notably \"hatun\" for women and \"bey\" for men). Consequently, the title \"valide hatun\" (title for living mother of reigning Ottoman sultan before 16th century) also turned into \"valide sultan\". This usage underlines the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as family prerogative.\n\nWestern tradition knows the Ottoman ruler as \"sultan\", but the Ottomans themselves used \"padişah\" (emperor) or \"hünkar\" to refer to their ruler. The emperor’s formal title consisted of \"sultan\" together with \"khan\" (for example, Sultan Suleiman Khan). In formal address, the sultan’s children were also entitled \"sultan\", with imperial princes (şehzade) carrying the title before their given name, with imperial princesses carrying it after. Example, Şehzade Sultan Mehmed and Mihrimah Sultan, son and daughter of Suleiman the Magnificent. Like imperial princesses, the living mother and main consort of reigning sultans also carried the title after their given names, for example, Hafsa Sultan, Suleiman’s mother and first valide sultan, and Hürrem Sultan, Suleiman’s chief consort and first haseki sultan. The evolving usage of this title reflected power shifts among imperial women, especially between Sultanate of Women, as the position of main consort eroded over the course of 17th century, the main consort lost the title \"sultan\", which replaced by \"kadin\", a title related to the earlier \"khatun\". Henceforth, the mother of the reigning sultan was the only person of non imperial blood to carry the title \"sultan\".\n\nTitle \"valide\" carried before or after given name. According to a genealogical website, the formal way of addressing a \"valide\" is \"Devletlû İsmetlu\" (given name) \"Vâlide Sultân Aliyyetü'ş-Şân Hazretleri\". Many westerner often translated their official title, \"sultan\", to title which not exist in Ottoman royalti officially, \"sultana\", possibly for distinguished them from Ottoman ruler and other male member of Ottoman dynasty.\n\nValide sultan was perhaps the most important position in the Ottoman Empire after the sultan himself. As the mother to the sultan, by Islamic tradition (\"A mother's right is God's right\"), the valide sultan would have a significant influence on the affairs of the empire. She had great power in the court and her own rooms (always adjacent to her son's) and state staff. Valide sultan also traditionally had access to considerable economic resources and often funded major architectural projects. In particular during the 17th century, in a period known as the \"Sultanate of Women\", a series of incompetent or child sultans raised the role of the valide sultan to new heights.\n\nThe most powerful and well-known of all valide sultans in the history of the Ottoman Empire were Nurbanu Sultan, Safiye Sultan, Kösem Sultan and Turhan Hatice Sultan.\n\nMost harem women who were slaves were never formally married to the sultans. Nevertheless, their children were considered fully legitimate under Islamic law if recognized by the father. However , only very few harem women who became Valide Sultans upon their son's ascension to the throne were indeed freed from slavery and married to their spouses , the former Ottoman Sultans. These Sultanas were Nurbanu Sultan , Kösem Sultan , Rabia Gülnuş Sultan and Perestu Kadın.\n\nThe list does not include the complete list of mothers of the Ottoman sultans. Most who held the title of valide sultan were the biological mothers of the reigning sultans. The mothers who died before their sons' accession to throne, never assumed the title of \"valide sultan\", like Hurrem Sultan, Muazzez Sultan, Mihrişah Kadın, Şermi Kadın, Tirimüjgan Kadın, Gülcemal Kadın, and Gülüstü Hanım. In special cases, there were grandmothers and stepmothers of the reigning sultans who assumed the title of \"valide sultan\", like Kösem Sultan and Perestu Kadın.\nNormally, living mother of reigning sultan held title Valide Sultan. But in exceptional cases, there were women who didn't hold this title when their sons became Sultan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2115860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2115860", "title": "Dino Rađa", "text": "Dino Rađa\n\nDino Rađa (Anglicized: Dino Radja, ; born 24 April 1967) is a Croatian former professional basketball player. He was a member of the Jugoplastika team of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which he helped to win two FIBA European Champions Cup championships (1989 and 1990). He spent three and a half seasons with the Boston Celtics, being one of the European pioneers in the NBA. Rađa was named one of FIBA's 50 Greatest Players in 1991, and one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors in 2008. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, as a member of the 2018 class.\n\nRađa began his basketball life in his native town, as a junior at KK Dalvin. He moved to KK Split, which at the time went under the name of its longtime naming-rights sponsor Jugoplastika. At KK Split, Rađa starred alongside Toni Kukoč, while both were teenagers. The duo led the team to dominance of the FIBA European Champions Cup, with repeat championship seasons in (1989 and 1990).\n\nIn late June 1989, the 22-year-old center got drafted by the Boston Celtics in the second round as the 40th pick. Right away, he publicly expressed willingness to go to Boston immediately \"if the financial offer is good\", and thus join fellow Yugoslavs Vlade Divac, Dražen Petrović, and Žarko Paspalj, who were also on their way to the NBA that summer. However, led by the club's general manager Josip Bilić, Jugoplastika was adamant Rađa would not be released since they had him under contract until 1992. The entire case quickly turned into a months-long saga that played out in the Yugoslav media. The club's head coach, Božidar Maljković, even publicly called on the Yugoslav Basketball Association (KSJ) to adopt safeguard policies, preventing players younger than age 26 from transferring to NBA teams. After weeks of wrangling over his status, Rađa tried to force Jugoplastika's hand by physically going over to the U.S. in early August 1989 and unilaterally signing a one-year contract with the Celtics, reportedly worth in the neighborhood of $500,000. He furthermore began practicing with the team at their Brandeis University training facilities. However, seeing the situation as a clear case of contract poaching by Boston and its general manager Jan Volk (who claimed Rađa's contract with Jugoplastika was amateur and thus non-binding), the Split club would not give up the legal fight, taking the case to the United States district court for the District of Massachusetts and seeking an injunction to prevent Rađa from playing for the Celtics on the grounds that he had a valid and legally binding contract with them. Following a hearing on 26 September 1989, Judge Douglas Woodlock ruled in their favor two days later thus preventing Rađa from playing for the Celtics. Since Rađa was physically already in Boston, bringing him back to Yugoslavia required some kind of an agreement. By mid-November 1989, Jugoplastika and the Celtics agreed to terms under which the player went back to complete the 1989–90 season in Split before having the rights to his services transferred to the Celtics effective 1 June 1990. The deal centered around the Celtics paying an undisclosed sum of money to Jugoplastika, which in turn agreed to let Rađa go two years short of his contract's completion.\n\nRađa was thus back in Split for the 1989–90 season. That same season, Jugoplastika again won the Yugoslav League, its third consecutive national domestic league title, as well as its second straight FIBA European Champions Cup.\n\nDespite the team's success, as previously agreed, Rađa would not stay in Split past June 1990 thus relinquishing the chance to go for the historic FIBA European Champions Cup three-peat (which the club, led by Kukoč, achieved the following year), but he would not go to Boston either.\n\nIn August 1990, instead of going to the NBA as previously agreed, Rađa went to Italy, signing with the wealthy Virtus Roma despite claiming all along that he had wanted to join the Celtics. He changed his mind once Virtus, an ambitious and financially stable club bankrolled by the food company and sponsored by the daily broadsheet \"Il Messaggero\", made him an offer reportedly in the US$15–18 million range for a 5-year contract. Italian and Yugoslav newspapers reported that Rađa's annual salary at the time, L3.6 billion, at Virtus was higher than soccer superstars Diego Maradona's and Roberto Baggio's annual compensations at Napoli and Juventus, respectively. The Boston Celtics did not insist on Rađa honouring his commitment to them, instead letting the twenty-three-year-old go to Virtus in return for an undisclosed amount, but retaining his NBA rights. Reportedly, part of the reason Boston did not put up much of a fight when the player suddenly decided to sign with Virtus was the July 1990 court decision against them following the motion by Rađa's American agent, Marc Fleisher, after the Virtus offer came in. Taking advantage of an administrative loophole, Fleisher claimed that Rađa's contract with the Celtics violated a provision of the agreement between the league and the NBA players that said, among other things, that one-year contracts could not be extended. A special officer of the court had heard the case and ruled in Rađa's favour, against the Celtics.\n\nSimultaneous to the legal battle his agent was waging over the future of his club career, Rađa had been spending the summer of 1990 with the Yugoslav national team in a four-month training camp for the 1990 FIBA World Championship that included an appearance at the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle where the 23-year-old suffered a leg fracture in the final game against the U.S. national team, ruling him out of the World Championship that started a week later. Yugoslavia head coach Dušan Ivković later revealed that injured Rađa and the center's agent Marc Fleisher asked him not to publicly disclose the player's injury before the deal with Virtus is signed, which Ivković consented to.\n\nSome observers saw Virtus' sudden and lucrative contract offer to Rađa as their retribution to the Celtics for going to court a few months earlier over enforcing Virtus' point guard Brian Shaw's NBA contract and winning the case even after the player who had spent the previous 1989-90 season with Virtus tried to remain in Rome.\n\nIn 2005, commenting on his summer 1990 decision to stay in Europe, even after only a year prior seeming desperately intent on playing in the NBA, Rađa said: \n\nRađa averaged 17.9 points in the Italian League in his first season with Il Messaggero (Virtus Roma enjoyed sponsorship from that popular Roman newspaper at the time). European sports journalists voted him the second best European player that season, behind only his former teammate and friend Kukoč.\n\nHe improved his scoring average each of the next two seasons with the Roman club, averaging 20.3 and 21.7 points in the Italian League, respectively.\n\nIn 1992, he led Virtus to a European 3rd-tier level FIBA Korać Cup title.\n\nRađa finally joined the Celtics in the summer of 1993, signing a three-year contract on 9 July, four years after initial interest from both parties and the voided contract in 1989. Some two and a half weeks later, the team went through a shocking incident when the Celtics' leading scorer, small forward Reggie Lewis, died on the basketball court at the team's Brandeis University practice facility after suffering sudden cardiac death from a heart defect.\n\nPlaying alongside Dee Brown, 40-year-old veteran Robert Parish, and Rick Fox, twenty-six-year-old Rađa averaged 15.1 points and 7.2 rebounds in his debut season during which he made $1.5 million in salary. With a 32–50 regular season record, the Celtics missed the NBA playoffs, finishing 10th overall in the eastern conference. At the end of the season, Rađa was voted to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team, along with Kukoč, who had just completed his rookie campaign with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nIn early November 1994, at the start of his second season with the Celtics, Rađa was looking for a contract extension on his existing three-year deal, which was expiring in the summer of 1996. With his agent Mark Fleisher engaged in long negotiations with the Celtics brass led by GM Jan Volk, the deal was reached to add three more years to Rađa's existing contract beginning with the 1996–97 season.\n\nThe 1996–97 season, Rađa's fourth in Boston, was marked by a left knee injury that forced him to miss 57 regular season games. In January 1997, he underwent arthroscopic surgery on his knee. The Celtics finished the season dead-last in their division, with a 15–67 record, the worst in the eastern conference, forcing a coaching change at the end of the season, with Rick Pitino replacing M. L. Carr.\n\nIn June 1997, a trade that was to send thirty-year-old Rađa to the Philadelphia 76ers (in exchange for Clarence Weatherspoon and Michael Cage) fell through when Rađa failed his 24 June 1997 physical with the 76ers. Apparently, the 76ers staffers that examined Rađa determined he had no cartilage in his left knee, estimating that \"because his left knee is bone-on-bone, he can play games, but he can't practice afterwards, because his knee will swell\" and that \"he can't play four games in six days\". The Celtics initially challenged the 76ers' decision to void the trade, but quickly dropped their arbitration request. Rađa had three more years left on his guaranteed contract and, according to the NBA regulations, if he was to fail another team's physical, the Celtics would have to pay his entire remaining salary. Unconvinced about Rađa's physical condition, the Celtics gave up on trying to trade him, instead agreeing a buyout of the three years that remained on his contract. Following the buyout, the Celtics waived Rađa on 16 July 1997.\n\nIn 2005, Rađa talked about his exit from Boston: \n\nOver the course of his four seasons with the Celtics, Rađa averaged 16.7 points and 8.4 rebounds per game in the regular season. In the NBA playoffs, where he only made a single appearance with four games played, he averaged 15.0 points and 7.0 rebounds per game.\n\nIn the wake of his failed physical in Philadelphia and Rick Pitino's unwillingness to keep him on the Celtics' roster, Rađa returned to Europe in July 1997, joining Panathinaikos, a rich and ambitious club bankrolled by the Giannakopoulos brothers (Pavlos and Thanasis) who made their money in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nFor Panathinaikos' owners, finishing the previous 1996–97 season without any trophies (having previously, in the 1995–96 season, won both the FIBA European League and the Greek Cup) was deemed unacceptable, bringing about big changes to the team. The team's head coach Božidar Maljković (Rađa's mentor from his Split days) had already been released during the previous failed season, while his interim replacement, Michalis Kokalis, was let go in the summer of 1997 to make way for new head coach Slobodan Subotić. Also coming in alongside Rađa and coach Subotić, was 36-year-old NBA veteran Byron Scott from the LA Lakers.\n\nRađa spent two years in Athens, winning two Greek League championships, but in 1999, he returned to his native Croatia, to play for Zadar. He left Panathinaikos partly because of an encounter with the club president's son, Dimitrios Giannakopoulos, in the locker room after a game. The president's son, Dimitrios, allegedly cursed at the team's head coach Subotić, but at that time, Rađa did not know that the person he was arguing with was the son of the club's president. He left the club at the end of the season, after winning the Greek League finals against Olympiacos.\n\nIn 2000, he returned to Greece, joining Panathinaikos' long-time rivals, Olympiacos, in an unsuccessful attempt to regain the Greek League championship. With Olympiacos, on 16 October 2000, he scored his first points in the EuroLeague competition, under its new format in which it was run by Euroleague Basketball, in a match against Real Madrid.\n\nHe returned, once again, to Croatia, joining Cibona for the 2001–02 season. Rađa finished his career in 2003, by winning the Croatian League championship with his first team, Split CO.\n\nRađa was on the senior men's Yugoslavian national team that won the silver medal in the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul. He was also a part of the golden Yugoslavian teams at the 1987 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in Bormio, Italy, EuroBasket 1989 in Zagreb and the EuroBasket 1991 in Rome.\n\nFollowing Croatia's independence, Rađa became an important player of the senior men's Croatian national basketball team, most notably at the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona, where Croatia won the silver medal. Rađa was also on the Croatian teams that won the bronze at the EuroBasket 1993 in Germany, 1994 FIBA World Championship in Toronto, and the EuroBasket 1995 in Athens. With 1,764 points scored, he was the all-time top scorer for the Croatian national team until 2018, when he was surpassed by Bojan Bogdanović.\n\n\n\nIn 1985, eighteen-year-old Jugoplastika junior squad player Rađa began dating nineteen-year-old Željana from Solin, a basketball player in the club's women's team. The couple got married during late summer 1990 at Vatrogasni dom in Kaštel Sućurac right before Rađa's move to Rome to play for Virtus. Their son Duje was born in 1997.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Rađa began romantic involvement with singer and 1995 Miss Croatia runner-up Viktorija Đonlić, a relationship that eventually led to divorce from his wife. Rađa married Đonlić in August 2001 on a yacht anchored off the coast of Korčula with singer Petar Grašo as his best man. In 2003, the couple's son Roko was born followed by son Niko in 2008.\n\n"}

Later, in 1956, Maule was hired by \"Sports Illustrated\", where he covered football for 19 years.\n\nMaule referred to the 1958 NFL Championship Game between the Giants and the Colts as \"the best game ever,\" according to writer Mark Bowden. Bowden wrote a 50th-anniversary book about the game using Maule's description as his title.\n\nWhen the upstart American Football League (AFL) began play in 1960, Maule did not conceal his loyalty to, nor his preference for, Rozelle and the NFL. For years he ridiculed and made light of the rival AFL. For example, in a September 30, 1968 \"SI\" piece entitled \"The Young Generals\" (referenced below), supposedly about Pro Football's best young quarterbacks, he praised such mediocre NFL signal-callers as Gary Cuozzo, Randy Johnson and Kent Nix, and never even mentioned Daryle Lamonica, Bob Griese, or Joe Namath. His contempt for the AFL was mimicked by other writers who wrote derivatory columns, spreading the impression that the AFL was inferior to the NFL.\n\nMaule gained such notoriety for his bias that it was well known to his media contemporaries. During the broadcast of the AFL's New York Jets' defeat of the NFL champion Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III, announcer Curt Gowdy asked (off-air): \"\"I wonder if that (S.O.B.) Tex Maule is watching?\"\" The comment can be heard on existing videos of the NBC-TV network feed of the game.\n\nMaule also was a prolific author during the late 1950s and early 1960s.

From Dallas, he returned to New York to write on a freelance basis. It was there he died in 1981. He was famed for saying, \"It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty\" in regards to the treatment which Muhammad Ali gave Ernie Terrell.\n\nIn 1972 he wrote a book, \"Running Scarred\" [Pelham Books 1972], about his experience having a heart attack and taking up running afterwards.\n\nNote: books may be published under the name \"Hamilton Maule\" or \"Tex Maule\"\n\n"}

She was the younger sister of the singer and activist Joan Baez.\n\nFariña's father, a physicist affiliated with Stanford University and MIT, moved his family frequently due to his job assignments, working in the United States and in international locations. She benefited from dance and music lessons, and took up the guitar, joining the 1960s American folk music revival.\n\nFariña met novelist, musician, and composer Richard Fariña in 1963 when she was 17 years old and married him at age 18 in Paris. The two collaborated on a number of influential folk albums, most notably, \"Celebrations for a Grey Day\" (1965) and \"Reflections in a Crystal Wind\" (1966), both on Vanguard Records. After Richard Fariña's death in 1966 (on Mimi's twenty-first birthday) in a motorcycle accident, Mimi moved to San Francisco where she flourished as a singer, songwriter, model, actress, and activist.

Mimi and Milan divorced in 1971.\n\nAmong the songs she has written is \"In the Quiet Morning (for Janis Joplin)\", which her sister recorded and released in 1972 on the album \"Come from the Shadows\". The song is also included on a number of compilations, including Joan Baez' \"Greatest Hits\".\n\nBy 1973, Mimi was asked to accompany her sister Joan and B.B. King when they performed for the prisoners in Sing Sing Prison. This experience, along with her arrest in 1967, led her to a desire to do more for those who are held in institutions. \n\nIn 1974, Fariña founded Bread and Roses, a nonprofit co-operative organization, designed to bring free music and entertainment to institutions: jails, prisons, hospitals, juvenile facilities, and nursing homes. Initially it was active in the San Francisco Bay area, but later, nationally. It still remains in operation, producing 500 shows per year. The organization's name came from \"Bread and Roses\", a 1911 poem by James Oppenheim, which is commonly associated with a 1912 garment workers strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts.\n\nThough she continued to sing in her later years, releasing an album in 1985 and performing sporadically, Fariña devoted most of her time to running Bread and Roses. In the late 1980s, she teamed with Pete Sears to play a variety of benefit and protest concerts. Many concerts were concerned with human rights issues in Central America, especially the U.S.-backed civil wars in Guatemala and El Salvador. They once set up to play on the abandoned railroad tracks outside the Concord Naval Weapons Center in California. Surrounded by military police, Fariña and Sears played a show for people protesting U.S. weapons being shipped to government troops in El Salvador.\n\nIn 1986, she took the time to record her own album \"Mimi Fariña Solo\".\n\nFariña used her connections with the folksinging community to elicit help in her focus with Bread and Roses, including Pete Seeger, Paul Winter, Odetta, Judy Collins, Taj Mahal, Lily Tomlin, Carlos Santana, and Bonnie Raitt, and others. In 2000, Bread and Roses brought performers to play at more than 500 concerts in 82 institutions.\n\nFariña died of neuroendocrine cancer at her home in California on July 18, 2001 at age 56. A memorial service was held on August 7 at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. Eulogies from Joan Baez, Paul Liberatore and Lana Severn were heard by the 1,200 people who attended.\n\nThe life of Mimi Fariña partially is chronicled in David Hajdu's book \"Positively 4th Street\". She is referenced in the Armistead Maupin novel \"Tales of the City\", set in San Francisco in the 1970s, and she appeared in a cameo role in the 1993 miniseries based on the novel.\n\nShe is referred to by Carol Ward (Catherine O'Hara) in the U.S. television series \"Six Feet Under\", in which it is stated that Fariña had been involved with the production of the (fictitious) \"Pack Up Your Sorrows: The Mimi Fariña Story\". She also was the subject of sister Joan Baez' 1969 song \"Sweet Sir Galahad\".\n\nShe appears in the 2012 documentary \"Greenwich Village: Music That Defined a Generation\"\n\n\n"}

When set up and used correctly, the result is a continuous sustained note that can be used as is, or treated to create new sounds or emulate traditional instruments.\n\nIn addition to his own instrument, based on a Tokai copy of a Stratocaster, Brook produced two other Infinite Guitars.

It serves approximately 400 students in grades 9–12 and a postgraduate year. \n\nCushing Academy was founded in 1865 by Thomas Parkman Cushing (1787-1854), a Boston merchant. Upon his death, Thomas Parkman Cushing bequeathed money to establish Cushing Academy. Following a provision from his will, the money accumulated for ten years before a board of trustees applied for an act of incorporation. On May 15, 1865, the Great and General Court of Massachusetts granted a charter, and the Academy opened in 1875 on land formerly known as Bancroft Farm. Cushing opened in September 1875 with a coeducational student body: 66 boys and 56 girls. The first principal was Edwin Pierce. It was among the first coeducational boarding schools on the east coast.\n\nThe alma mater, \"The Dear Old Cushing Days\", was written by alumna Cora Coolidge, a distant relative of Calvin Coolidge. \n\nCushing is located on a 162-acre campus that overlooks the town center of Ashburnham, which is about 62 miles from Boston. The campus occupies hills with a view of Mount Wachusett to the south and Mount Monadnock to the north.\n\nThough Cushing has never been affiliated with a religious denomination, early generations of students were required to submit reports of the services they attended once a week and attend services daily. The church attendance requirement was dropped entirely in 1970 at the appeal of the student body.\n\nA statue, the Schoolboy of 1850, honors both students and, more specifically, boys who fought in the Civil War. It was designed by Bela Pratt and was donated to Ashburnham by local businessman Ivers Whitney Adams in 1913. The statue is now located near the entrance to Cushing. In 2005, female students designed and created a schoolgirl statute.In 2009, Cushing made headlines for its plans to spend $500,000 transforming the Fisher-Watkins Library into a learning center with e-readers, e-book database subscriptions, flat-screen televisions, laptop-friendly study carrels, and a coffee shop. Several months later, the headmaster stated that most the library's printed books would be replaced over a two-year period with e-books, but reassured that \"books, in all formats, will continue to abound at Cushing.\" As of 2018, the library has thousands of print books as well as online databases with access to e-books, journals, and more.\n\nIn 2015, Cushing Academy celebrated its sesquicentennial with several events and the publication of a commemorative magazine. \n\nIn October 2017, the board of trustees announced that Randy R. Bertin, Ed.D., of Besant Hill School in Ojai, California, was unanimously appointed the 13th Head of Cushing Academy, effective July 1, 2018.\n\nAs of fall 2018, the student body has 390 students, 59% male and 41% female. Financial aid assists 38% of the students. Thirty-four percent are from Massachusetts and 18% are domestic students of color.\n\nThe student body comes from 25 states and 30 countries; 39% of students are international and 88% of students board at Cushing. Cushing began accepting international students in 1889. The faculty-student ratio is 1:8 and 57% of faculty holds advanced degrees.\n\nThe middle 50% of the Class of 2019 had a combined SAT score range of 1030-1310. Ninety-five percent of the class of 2018 attended four-year colleges or universities.\n\nThe academic buildings include the Main Building (completed in 1875, and following a fire, a new building was dedicated in 1894), the Joseph R. Curry Academic Center, the English Building, and the Emily Fisher Landau Center for Visual Arts. Ashburnham House and Alumni Hall are the largest student dormitories. Sports facilities include the Watkins Field House, Heslin Gym, Theodore Iorio Arena, and several athletic fields and tennis courts.\n\nLowe Hall, built in 1890 as a dormitory for female students, was named for board of trustees member Dr. Abraham T. Lowe. Lore has it that Bette Davis, who lived in Lowe, carved her name into a closet. Lowe was most recently remodeled in 2015.\n\nCushing offers courses in classical and modern languages, computer science, English, history and social science, mathematics, performing arts, visual arts, and support services such as English as a second language and academic support. Cushing sponsors an annual common read. \n\nSports have been an important part of life at Cushing since the early years of the school. In 1876, the first baseball game was played at Cushing. Cushing formed a boys' basketball team in 1897 and a girls' team the next year. \n\nCushing has a long hockey tradition that began in the early 1900s, though the boys' team in its present form has only been around since the 1980s. The boys' hockey team was formed in 1924 and the girls' team in 1995. \n\nCushing alumni include a number of professional or Olympic hockey players. The boys' varsity hockey team has won two New England Elite championships, 21 in-season tournament championships, and one Martin/Earl tournament title in the large-school division. \n\nAs of 2018, Cushing has dozens of teams in the following sports: cross country, field hockey, soccer, skiing, football, volleyball, basketball, ice hockey, baseball, golf, lacrosse, softball, tennis, and track & field. \n\nCushing is a member of the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council.\n\nClubs and organizations at Cushing include A Cappella, Art Club, Black Student Union, Classical Music Club, Debate Club, E-News Club, Film Club, International Club, Kindness Club, Math Club, Model United Nations, and Pride.\n\nThe student newspaper, \"The Breeze\", has been published since 1888. The student yearbook, \"The Penguin\", has been published since 1933.\n\nCushing's annual Mountain Day tradition began in 1926 in honor of Dr. Cowell, the third principal. Mountain Day was started by James W. Vose, Cowell’s successor. On Mountain Day, which traditionally takes place in late September, the Cushing community goes to Mount Monadnock for a day of walking. During World War II, Mountain Day was held at the nearer Mount Watatic for a few years due to gas rationing. \n\nAnother tradition is the Winter Carnival. The first carnival, in 1921, was an athletic competition. The modern winter carnival has some outdoor events, but also indoor events such as cupcake decorating.\n\n\n\n\nRand, Frank Prentice. \"Cushing Academy, 1865-1965\".

But up against the other heavy-guitar, heartily vocalized bands like the aforementioned, they have their work cut out for them.\" Andy Hinds of AllMusic highlighted the first three tracks as standouts but found the album overall to be devoid of originality in its borrowing of grunge music, saying it \"provides a non-threatening option for those who seek the stylistic affectations of grunge rock, but wish to avoid all of the substance or excitement of its first generation.\" David Browne, writing for \"Entertainment Weekly\", noticed a slight difference between this and Puddle of Mudd's \"Come Clean\" apart from taking elements of grunge into their respective albums: \"Default’s debut, \"The Fallout\", is more up-tempo and burly, yet they still manage to use the word never 32 times in one cut (”Slow Me Down”).

He was the chaplain to the Provincial Congress when it met at Concord in October 1774, and he was a chaplain to the Continental Army when war had begun. The elder Emerson died of camp fever while on campaign in 1776, when Emerson was 7 years old.\n\nWilliam Emerson Jr. married Ruth Haskins on 25 October 1796 in Boston. She was the daughter of John Haskins of Boston. The Emersons had eight children: Phebe Ripley Emerson, John Clark Emerson, William Emerson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Edward Blis Emerson, Robert Bulkeley Emerson, Charles Chauncy Emerson, and Mary Caroline Emerson.\n\nWilliam Emerson attended Harvard College, graduating in 1789. The Reverend Nathaniel Thayer of Lancaster, Massachusetts was his classmate. Prior to his ordination, Emerson taught school.\n\nOn 21 December 1791, the Congregational Church and town of Harvard, Massachusetts extended the call to William Emerson to become their fifth minister. Emerson, who had been preaching on probation, accepted the call 9 April 1792 and was ordained on 23 May 1792. Present at his ordination were ministers from Acton, Boxborough, Concord, East Sudbury, and Littleton, Massachusetts. Concord's Ezra Ripley preached the ordination sermon on Acts 26:18. The town paid the Reverend Emerson $333.30 yearly. While in Harvard, Emerson organized a social library club, serving as its custodian.\n\nOn 17 June 1799, the First Church in Boston asked the Harvard church for Emerson's release so that he could become their minister.\n\nIn 1799, the Reverend William Emerson was dismissed by the Harvard church to become the minister of Boston's First Church, for a bonus of a thousand dollars. After this initial interest, his sermons appear to have roused no great enthusiasm, as George Ticknor noted in the \"Christian Examiner\", September, 1849: \"Mr. Emerson, transplanted to the First Church in Boston six years before Mr. Buckminster's settlement, possessed, on the contrary, a graceful and dignified style of speaking, which was by no means without its attraction, but he lacked the fervor that could rouse the masses, and the original resources that could command the few.\" He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1803.\n\nIn 1804, Emerson founded the Anthology Club, a Boston literary society, and wrote articles for the club's \"The Monthly Anthology\". This publication was the forerunner of the \"North American Review\", America's leading literary journal at the time. The Club's reading room led to the founding in 1807 of the Boston Athenaeum.\n\nIn 1806, Emerson was the chaplain for the Massachusetts General Court.\n\nThe Reverend William Emerson is buried in the First Church, in Boston.\n"}

It was founded by the Gloucester Asylum Trust in 1860 as Barnwood House Institution and later became known as Barnwood House Hospital. The hospital catered for well-to-do patients, with reduced terms for those in financial difficulties. It was popular with the military and clergy, and once counted an Archbishop amongst its patients. During the late nineteenth century Barnwood House flourished under superintendent Frederick Needham, making a healthy profit and receiving praise from the Commissioners in Lunacy. Even the sewerage system was held up as a model of good asylum practice. After the First World War service patients, including war poet and composer Ivor Gurney, were treated with a regime of psychotherapy and recreations such as cricket.\n\nDuring the 1960s Barnwood House experienced financial problems and closed in 1968. The grounds are now an arboretum run by Gloucester City Council. Barnwood House Trust continues to exist as a charity that supports research and awards grants to people with physical or mental disabilities in Gloucestershire. The Chief Executive is Sally Byng.\n\nBarnwood House opened its doors to patients on 6 January 1860, but its origins go back to the 18th century. In 1794 the governors of Gloucester Infirmary decided to follow the York example and raise a subscription for building an asylum. Sir George Onesiphorus Paul, philanthropist and prison reformer, was asked to draft a scheme for the management of the institution. The plans were put on hold as legislation was pending in Parliament. The County Asylums Act, which enabled counties to set up asylums for pauper lunatics on the rates, was passed in 1808 and the subscribers formed a union with the county and the city to build a joint asylum. Wotton asylum was opened in 1823 and the union lasted until 1856, when the County bought out the subscribers and the asylum became a county asylum for paupers. The subscribers began the search for new accommodation for their wealthy and charity patients. In 1858 they purchased and adapted Barnwood House in the village of Barnwood to the east of Gloucester (subsequent boundary changes brought the village inside the city boundary).\nBarnwood House Institution was intended for two classes of patients, as explained in 1882 regulations:\n\"FIRST – Patients in more or less affluent circumstances, who shall contribute, according to the accommodation required, such sums as may be agreed upon. SECOND – Patients in limited circumstances, but in a position in life to render them unsuitable for admission into County Asylums, who shall be received at such reduced rates of payment as the Committee, upon consideration of the circumstances of each case, may determine; and some even gratuitously, - preference being given to recent and curable cases, to which the gratuitous Patients are to be wholly confined.\"\n\nDr. Frederick Needham, former superintendent of York Asylum, became medical superintendent of Barnwood House in 1874. Under his direction the institution expanded, housing 129 patients by 1882, compared with 60 in 1864, and was described as a \"model lunatic hospital\".\n\"A model lunatic hospital: The Commissioners in Lunacy report that, on each recurring visit they find improvements completed or in progress, and an evident desire on the part of the committee, as of the superintendent, to render the hospital as perfect an institution for the care and treatment of the insane as it is possible to arrive at…. The rates of board charges are most moderate, the dietary is generous, the salaries of the officers are liberal, and the entertainments are sumptuous, and yet a profit of upwards of £4,000 a year is realized.\"\nEven the sanitary arrangements were singled out for praise:\n\"The same thoughtfulness and judicious provision which have brought the general management of Barnwood House Asylum to such a high pitch of excellence have evidently been brought to bear on its sanitary arrangements….The water-closets are all self-acting by means of rods, not wires, and have Tyler’s enamelled iron S-trapped pans and 6 inch [150 mm] soil pipes\"\n\nBut a darker side to the \"model lunatic hospital\" was revealed by newspaper reports of inquests into suicides, including that of the unexplained death of Barnwood’s junior assistant medical officer, Richard Bush Drury Batt, in 1886.\n\nWhilst at Barnwood, where he lived with his wife Charlotte (née Shooter), Needham took part in the regular entertainments and concerts, once playing the part of King Giltgingerbread in \"The Enchanted Princess\"; wrote a number of papers, including \"Brain Exhaustion\" and \"Insanity in relation to Society\"; and was president of the Psychological Association of Great Britain and Ireland in 1887. He left Barnwood in 1892 to become a Commissioner in Lunacy, and was knighted in 1915.\n\nRules for attendants at Barnwood House, published in 1880, stress the importance of obeying the orders of superintendent and matron, confidentiality, kindness and consideration towards patients. \n\nAn association with the Burden Neurological Institute from 1939 meant that Barnwood House patients were used in early experiments with electroconvulsive therapy and psychosurgery. William Ross Ashby, psychiatrist and pioneer of cybernetics, built his \"Homeostat\" machine in a laboratory at Barnwood House in the 1950s.\n\nThe Burden Neurological Institute opened in Stoke Gifford, near Bristol, Gloucestershire, in 1939 and formed links with Barnwood Hospital. The first published report on the use of electroconvulsive therapy on patients in England was a collaboration between Gerald Fleming, the medical superintendent of Barnwood House and editor of the \"Journal of Mental Science\", and Frederic Golla and William Grey Walter from the Burden Neurological Institute. German psychiatrist Lothar Kalinowsky had witnessed ECT in Italy and demonstrated it at the Burden Neurological Institute; five patients at Barnwood House were selected as guinea pigs for the new form of convulsive therapy.\n\"We selected five psychotics for treatment at Barnwood House. Altogether 75 shocks have been administered, as a result of which there have been 50 major convulsions and 25 minor attacks. There have been no unpleasant sequelae, and none of the patients has refused further treatments. This small preliminary series was not intended to provide data on the therapeutic value of the treatment – in only one of the patients could a remission be hoped for with any confidence – but was designed to throw light on the relative advantages and dangers of the method.\" \nThe advantages were immediately apparent: \n\"For the operator, only a small amount of training and experience is necessary, and a knowledge of physics, though desirable on general grounds, is not essential….the apparatus is comparatively cheap and portable, and preparation of the patient need take no more than a minute.\"\nFour certified patients at Barnwood House were also amongst the first in England to undergo prefrontal leucotomy, again as a result of a collaboration between Barnwood and the Burden Neurological Institute. The operations were performed in April 1941 by surgeon Francis Wilfred Willway with a paperknife. None of the first four Barnwood House patients left hospital after the operation, but were described as more manageable and well behaved. Barnwood House then employed the services of neurosurgeon Wylie McKissock to continue the leucotomy programme.\n\nWilliam Ross Ashby, pioneer of cybernetics, was director of research at Barnwood House from 1947–1959, before becoming director of research at BNI and then professor of Biophysics and Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois, USA. Whilst at Barnwood House he wrote \"Design for a Brain\" and \"Introduction to Cybernetics\", and constructed a black box with magnets which he called the Homeostat, \"the closest thing to a synthetic brain so far designed by man\".\n\nFrom 1948 to 1962 Barnwood House advertised its services in the \"Journal of Mental Science\" with the following words:\n\"A REGISTERED HOSPITAL (outside the National Health Service) for the CARE and TREATMENT of LADIES and GENTLEMEN suffering from NERVOUS and MENTAL DISORDERS. Within two miles [3 km] of the Western and London Midland Regional Railway Stations at Gloucester, the Hospital is easily accessible by rail from London and all parts of the United Kingdom. It is beautifully situated at the foot of the Cotswold Hills, and stands in its own grounds of over 300 acres [1.2 km²]. Voluntary Patients of both sexes are also received for treatment. Special accommodation is also provided at three villa residences, all of which stand in their own grounds and are entirely separate from the main Hospital. All the most modern methods of treatment including electric shock and prefrontal leucotomy are used.\"\nBut the \"most modern methods of treatment\" were losing their allure by the 1960s and, in spite of a new advertisement appearing in 1963 with no mention of ladies and gentleman, or leucotomy and electric shock, and the railway stations replaced by the A417, Barnwood House experienced financial difficulties and closed in 1968.\n\nThe Hospital at some point lost two wings, and became a residential house. From 1978 it was owned by the Forrest family and was used as a boarding house for girls from the nearby Selwyn Independent School for Girls in Matson, Gloucester. In 1983 the owners no longer took in boarders and it continued as a private residence until 2000 when it was bought by a property developer. The remaining part of the house was finally demolished in 2000 and a number of new houses built in its place. Part of the grounds is now Barnwood Arboretum, cared and conserved for by Gloucester City Council in conjunction with the Friends of Barnwood Arboretum.\n\n"}

Broadcasting on digital channel 15 (mapping to channel 11 using PSIP) from Cerro Colorado within the city limits of Tijuana, XHTJB is a repeater of the Canal Once public network owned and operated by the Instituto Politécnico Nacional.\n\nIn analog, the channel 3 allocation was initially not awarded to either San Diego or Tijuana—despite a severe need for additional VHF television channels in the area—because any high-powered signal would be short-spaced over water to KEYT-TV in Santa Barbara, California.\n\nHowever, by the 1990s, Mexican stations using lower power could utilize the frequency. In 1995, Mexico notified the United States that it would be building channel 3, with a proposed 100 kW effective radiated power. Through American coordination, the power of the station was reduced and an antenna pattern was used to minimize the station's interference to the United States. As part of the IPN's program to build repeater stations to extend the reach of its then-Once TV, XHTJB-TV signed on August 2, 1999, analog channel 3, raising its power over several days to 40 kW of effective radiated power. It was the fourth repeater station built by the IPN itself, after stations in Cuernavaca, San Luis Potosí and Valle de Bravo. When XHTJB signed on in mid-1999, it immediately caused interference to those in San Diego who had their VCRs and other devices with output set to channel 3; international coordination forced the new station to ramp up power levels gradually in order to help users rectify potential interference. Cox Communications and other San Diego stations even mounted an unsuccessful campaign to move XHTJB to another channel; however, no other channel was found that could adequately cover the Tijuana area.\n\nThe station's digital channel is multiplexed:\nXHTJB transitioned to digital in the late 2000s. Physical channel 46 remained after Tijuana's first-in-Mexico digital conversion occurred on July 18, 2013, using PSIP to display XHTJB's virtual channel as 3 (now 11) on digital receivers.\n\nOn October 27, 2016, in line with a major realignment of Mexican virtual channels, XHTJB and other Canal Once transmitters adopted virtual channel 11 nationwide. The station was able to do so because XHTJB's signal pattern (unlike most Tijuana stations) does not overlap with Los Angeles stations. The move freed channel 3 for use by Imagen Televisión's Tijuana transmitter.\n\nIn late 2017, XHTJB was approved to move to RF channel 15 for repacking purposes.\n"}

Originally a Christian who was conscripted and converted through the devşirme system, he became a Muslim and rose through the ranks of the janissaries. He became one of the prominent military commanders of Mehmed II and a \"lala\" – the sultan's advisor, mentor, tutor, councillor, protector, all at once. He removed his rival, the previous Grand Vizier Çandarlı Halil Pasha the Younger, amid the fall of Constantinople. He later served as the governor of Thessaly of Macedonia. He was the first non-Turk to be appointed Grand Vizier.\n\nZaganos was conscripted through the Devşirme system and rose through the ranks of the janissaries. He is thought to have been originally Christian of Albanian descent.. Some sources mention him as Albanian and some do not mention his descent. E. Goldberg, R. Kasaba and J. S. Migdal say that he was either Albanian or Serb. Jorga says that he was Albanian. D. Nicolle, J. F. Haldon and S. R. Turnbull believes that he was of Albanian or South Slavic origin. M. Philippides believes that he was of either Albanian or Greek origin. According to İnalcık he was possibly the son of Vrana Konti. He became a committed Muslim after conversion.\n\nWhen Mehmed II was exiled in 1446, Zagan accompanied him.\n\nYoung Mehmed II had after his return and accession (18 February 1451) confirmed Çandarlı Halil Pasha the Younger as his first Vizier (even though he seems to have disliked him), and raised Zaganos Pasha from third to second Vizier. Halil Pasha had been appointed first Vizier in 1439, after the demotion of Ishak Pasha. Zaganos, who was younger, was jealous of the position of Halil Pasha.\n\nDuring the Siege of Constantinople, the bulk of the Ottoman army were encamped south of the Golden Horn. The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from Anatolia under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the \"Mesoteichion\", where the guns and the elite regiments, the Janissaries, were positioned. The Bashi-bazouks were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under Zaganos were employed north of the Golden Horn. Communication was maintained by a road that had been constructed over the marshy head of the Horn. After the inconclusive frontal offensives, the Ottomans sought to break through the walls by constructing tunnels in an effort to mine them from mid-May to 25 May. Many of the sappers were miners of German origin sent from Novo Brdo by the Serbian Despot. They were placed under the command of Zaganos Pasha. However, the Byzantines employed an engineer named Johannes Grant (who was said to be German but was probably Scottish), who had counter-mines dug, allowing Byzantine troops to enter the mines and kill the Turkish workers. The Byzantines intercepted the first Serbian tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunneling efforts were interrupted on 21, 23, and 25 May, destroying them with Greek fire and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the Byzantines captured and tortured two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish tunnels, which were then destroyed. On 21 May, Mehmed sent an ambassador to Constantinople and offered to lift the siege if they gave him the city. Constantine XI accepted to pay higher tributes to the sultan and recognized the status of all the conquered castles and lands in the hands of the Turks as Ottoman possession. Around this time, Mehmed had a final council with his senior officers. Here he encountered some resistance; one of his Viziers, the veteran Halil Pasha, who had always disapproved of Mehmed's plans to conquer the city, now admonished him to abandon the siege in the face of recent adversity. Halil was overruled by Zaganos, who insisted on an immediate attack. Having been accused of bribery, Halil Pasha was put to death later that year. Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force, expecting that the weakened Byzantine defense by the prolonged siege would now be worn out before he ran out of troops and started preparations for a final all-out offensive.\n\nAfter the Ottoman occupation of Constantinople, the Sultan ordered Zaganos to set out with his galleys for Galata, to prevent the Byzantine ships from setting sail.\n\nThe stories of Halil Pasha's collaboration with the Byzantines were most likely spread by the faction of Zaganos. Zaganos succeeded Halil Pasha as Grand Vizier. In 1456, however, Zaganos was made scapegoat after a failed expedition against Hungarian-held Belgrade. Zaganos' daughter was expelled from the Sultan's harem, and the two were expelled to Balıkesir, where he probably had property. In 1459, Zaganos returned and became kapudan pasha of the fast-growing Ottoman navy, and the next year he was the governor of Thessaly and Macedonia.\n\nZaganos was said to be a tall and intelligent man. He has been called the most cruel Ottoman captain of his time, and was said to be an enemy of Christians. He was in absolute loyalty to Mehmed II, even when he was just a prince, knowing that his prospects depended on his master's success. Zaganos was a soldier who believed that the Ottoman Empire must always expand in order to keep the enemies off-balance. He was known for his warlike beliefs and played an important role in the 1453 Fall of Constantinople.\n\nHe was one of the prominent Ottoman military commanders of Mehmed II (Mehmet the Conqueror) and a \"lala\", at once an advisor, mentor, tutor, councilor, and protector, for the sultan.\n\nDuring the final siege of Constantinople, Zagan Pasha's troops were the first to reach the towers. Ulubatlı Hasan was the first soldier who reached the tower. During the siege many of the sappers were placed under the command of Zagan Pasha. Mehmet took Zaganos' advice almost exclusively.\n\nMehmet II honored him for his loyalty and honesty, along with the Sultan's two other Viziers, Halil Pasha and Sarica Pasha, by naming the three great towers of Rumeli Hisari after them. The tower to the south is named after Zaganos Pasha.\n\nHe married three times:\n\nHe had two sons Mehmed Bey and Ali Çelebi. His daughter from his first wife Sitti Hatice Hatun married Mehmed the Conqueror and another daughter Selçuk Hatun married Mahmud Pasha Angelovic.\n\nHis, as well as his family's, mausoleum is located in his endowment (1454), Zagan Pasha Mosque, in Balıkesir.\n\n\n"}

Compared to \"fast freight\" trains, drag freight trains have a very low power-to-weight ratio, making them somewhat unpredictable on steep grades or hilly routes. This causes many dispatchers to be extremely conservative with how they handle drag freights, especially when they share lines with higher priority fast freights and passenger trains.\n\nBefore and during WWI and into the 1920s, large locomotives such as the 2-8-2 Mikado were typically used for drag freight operations.\n\nAfter the railroads dieselized, heavy duty diesel locomotives (typically six-axle units, to improve adhesion) were used for the drag freights. Multiple unit operations allowed one person to control multiple locomotives. As many as 4-11 locomotives may be used for a heavy haul drag freight. Attempts were made to develop ultra large locomotives for this purpose, for example the Union Pacific DDA40X and gas-turbine locomotives.\n\nWhen AC traction motors and thyristor inverters became available, locomotives such as EMD SD70MAC and the GE AC4400CW replaced the older EMD SD40 on a three-for-two basis.\n\nIn the UK, such trains were called mineral trains and the locomotives that hauled them were called mineral locomotives. An example of a mineral locomotive was the LNWR 17in Coal Engine.\n\nThe trains were loose-coupled, had no continuous brakes, and were speed-limited to . The lack of brake power was a potential hazard and, when approaching a downhill gradient, it was necessary to stop the train and \"pin down\" the handbrakes on some of the wagons before proceeding.\n\nToday, Class 60 and Class 66 locomotives owned by the DB Cargo UK and Freightliner Heavy Haul are used for drag freights. Also, Class 59 locomotives owned by National Power, Foster Yeoman, and other large bulk shippers were used on the heavy freights in the 1990s. Because of coupling limits, only single units were used.\n"}

{"id": "2116016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116016", "title": "CIE 1931 color space", "text": "CIE 1931 color space\n\nThe CIE 1931 color spaces are the first defined quantitative links between distributions of wavelengths in the electromagnetic visible spectrum, and physiologically perceived colors in human color vision. The mathematical relationships that define these color spaces are essential tools for color management, important when dealing with color inks, illuminated displays, and recording devices such as digital cameras. The system was designed in 1931 by the \"\"Commission Internationale de l'éclairage\"\", known in English as the International Commission on Illumination. \n\nThe CIE 1931 RGB color space and CIE 1931 XYZ color space were created by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) in 1931. They resulted from a series of experiments done in the late 1920s by William David Wright using ten observers and John Guild using seven observers. The experimental results were combined into the specification of the CIE RGB color space, from which the CIE XYZ color space was derived.\n\nThe CIE 1931 color spaces are still widely used, as is the 1976 CIELUV color space.\n\nThe human eye with normal vision has three kinds of cone cells that sense light, having peaks of spectral sensitivity in short (\"S\", – ), middle (\"M\", – ), and long (\"L\", – ) wavelengths. These cone cells underlie human color perception in conditions of medium and high brightness; in very dim light color vision diminishes, and the low-brightness, monochromatic \"night vision\" receptors, denominated \"rod cells\", become effective. Thus, three parameters corresponding to levels of stimulus of the three kinds of cone cells, in principle describe any human color sensation. Weighting a total light power spectrum by the individual spectral sensitivities of the three kinds of cone cells renders three effective values of stimulus; these three values compose a tristimulus specification of the objective color of the light spectrum. The three parameters, denoted \"S\", \"M\", and \"L\", are indicated using a 3-dimensional space denominated the \"LMS color space\", which is one of many color spaces devised to quantify human color vision.\n\nA color space maps a range of physically produced colors from mixed light, pigments, etc. to an objective description of color sensations registered in the human eye, typically in terms of tristimulus values, but not usually in the LMS color space defined by the spectral sensitivities of the cone cells. The tristimulus values associated with a color space can be conceptualized as amounts of three primary colors in a tri-chromatic, additive color model. In some color spaces, including the LMS and XYZ spaces, the primary colors used are not real colors in the sense that they cannot be generated in any light spectrum.\n\nThe CIE XYZ color space encompasses all color sensations that are visible to a person with average eyesight. That is why CIE XYZ (Tristimulus values) is a device-invariant representation of color. It serves as a standard reference against which many other color spaces are defined. A set of color-matching functions, like the spectral sensitivity curves of the LMS color space, but not restricted to non-negative sensitivities, associates physically produced light spectra with specific tristimulus values.\n\nConsider two light sources composed of different mixtures of various wavelengths. Such light sources may appear to be the same color; this effect is denominated \"metamerism\". Such light sources have the same apparent color to an observer when they produce the same tristimulus values, regardless of the spectral power distributions of the sources.\n\nMost wavelengths stimulate two or all three kinds of cone cell because the spectral sensitivity curves of the three kinds overlap. Certain tristimulus values are thus physically impossible, for example LMS tristimulus values that are non-zero for the M component and zero for both the L and S components. Furthermore, LMS tristimulus values for pure spectral colors would, in any normal trichromatic additive color space, e. g. the RGB color spaces, imply negative values for at least one of the three primaries because the chromaticity would be outside the color triangle defined by the primary colors. To avoid these negative RGB values, and to have one component that describes the perceived brightness, \"imaginary\" primary colors and corresponding color-matching functions were formulated. The CIE 1931 color space defines the resulting tristimulus values, in which they are denoted by \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\". In XYZ space, all combinations of non-negative coordinates are meaningful, but many, such as the primary locations [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], and [0, 0, 1], correspond to imaginary colors outside the space of possible LMS coordinates; imaginary colors do not correspond to any spectral distribution of wavelengths and therefore have no physical reality.\n\nWhen judging the relative luminance (brightness) of different colors in well-lit situations, humans tend to perceive light within the green parts of the spectrum as brighter than red or blue light of equal power. The luminosity function that describes the perceived brightnesses of different wavelengths is thus roughly analogous to the spectral sensitivity of M cones.\n\nThe CIE model capitalizes on this fact by setting \"Y\" as luminance. \"Z\" is quasi-equal to blue, or the S cone response, and \"X\" is a mix of response curves chosen to be nonnegative. The XYZ tristimulus values are thus analogous to, but different from, the LMS cone responses of the human eye. Setting \"Y\" as luminance has the useful result that for any given \"Y\" value, the XZ plane will contain all possible chromaticities at that luminance.\n\nThe unit of the tristimulus values , , and is often arbitrarily chosen so that or is the brightest white that a color display supports. In this case, the Y value is known as the relative luminance. The corresponding whitepoint values for and can then be inferred using the standard illuminants.\n\nDue to the distribution of cones in the eye, the tristimulus values depend on the observer's field of view. To eliminate this variable, the CIE defined a color-mapping function called the standard (colorimetric) observer, to represent an average human's chromatic response within a 2° arc inside the fovea. This angle was chosen owing to the belief that the color-sensitive cones resided within a 2° arc of the fovea. Thus the \"CIE 1931 Standard Observer\" function is also known as the \"CIE 1931 2° Standard Observer\". A more modern but less-used alternative is the \"CIE 1964 10° Standard Observer\", which is derived from the work of Stiles and Burch, and Speranskaya.\n\nFor the 10° experiments, the observers were instructed to ignore the central 2° spot. The 1964 Supplementary Standard Observer function is recommended when dealing with more than about a 4° field of view. Both standard observer functions are discretized at wavelength intervals from to and distributed by the CIE. All corresponding values have been calculated from experimentally obtained data using interpolation. The standard observer is characterized by three \"color matching functions\".\n\nThe derivation of the CIE standard observer from color matching experiments is given below, after the description of the CIE RGB space.\n\nThe CIE's color matching functions formula_1, formula_2 and formula_3 are the numerical description of the chromatic response of the \"observer\" (described above). They can be thought of as the spectral sensitivity curves of three linear light detectors yielding the CIE tristimulus values \"X\", \"Y\" and \"Z\". Collectively, these three functions are known as the CIE standard observer.\n\nThe CIE XYZ color matching functions can be approximated by a sum of Gaussian functions, as follows:\n\nLet \"g\"(\"x\") denote a general Gaussian function, defined by\n\nThat is, \"g\"(\"x\") resembles a bell curve with its peak at , a spread/standard deviation of \"σ\" to the left of the mean, spread of \"σ\" to the right of the mean, and scaling parameter \"α\". With the wavelength \"λ\" measured in angstroms, we then approximate the color matching functions as follows:\n\nThis approximation can be easily employed in a programming language in a functional style. For example, here is a Haskell implementation:\nxyzOfWavelength λ = map (sum . map g)\nHere is a semi-functional style implementation in C:\ndouble gaussian(double x, double alpha, double mu, double sigma1, double sigma2) {\n\nvoid xyzFromWavelength(double* xyz, double wavelength) {\n\nThe CIE XYZ color matching functions are nonnegative, and lead to nonnegative XYZ coordinates for all real colors (that is, for nonnegative light spectra). Other observers, such as for the CIE RGB space or other RGB color spaces, are defined by other sets of three color-matching functions, not generally nonnegative, and lead to tristimulus values in those other spaces, which may include negative coordinates for some real colors.\n\nThe tristimulus values for a color with a spectral radiance \"L\" are given in terms of the standard observer by:\nwhere formula_9 is the wavelength of the equivalent monochromatic light (measured in nanometers), and customary limits of the integral are formula_10.\n\nThe values of \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" are bounded if the radiance spectrum \"L\" is bounded.\n\nThe reflective and transmissive cases are very similar to the emissive case, with a few differences. The spectral radiance \"L\" is replaced by the spectral reflectance (or transmittance) \"S(λ)\" of the object being measured, multiplied by the spectral power distribution of the illuminant \"I(λ)\".\n\nwhere \n\n\"K\" is a scaling factor (usually 1 or 100), and formula_9 is the wavelength of the equivalent monochromatic light (measured in nanometers), and the standard limits of the integral are formula_10.\n\nSince the human eye has three types of color sensors that respond to different ranges of wavelengths, a full plot of all visible colors is a three-dimensional figure. However, the concept of color can be divided into two parts: brightness and chromaticity. For example, the color white is a bright color, while the color grey is considered to be a less bright version of that same white. In other words, the chromaticity of white and grey are the same while their brightness differs.\n\nThe CIE XYZ color space was deliberately designed so that the \"Y\" parameter is a measure of the luminance of a color. The chromaticity is then specified by the two derived parameters \"x\" and \"y\", two of the three normalized values being functions of all three tristimulus values \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\": \n\nThe derived color space specified by \"x\", \"y\", and \"Y\" is known as the CIE xyY color space and is widely used to specify colors in practice.\n\nThe \"X\" and \"Z\" tristimulus values can be calculated back from the chromaticity values \"x\" and \"y\" and the \"Y\" tristimulus value: \n\nThe figure on the right shows the related chromaticity diagram. The outer curved boundary is the \"spectral locus\", with wavelengths shown in nanometers. Note that the chromaticity diagram is a tool to specify how the human eye will experience light with a given spectrum. It cannot specify colors of objects (or printing inks), since the chromaticity observed while looking at an object depends on the light source as well.\n\nMathematically the colors of the chromaticity diagram occupy a region of the real projective plane.\n\nThe chromaticity diagram illustrates a number of interesting properties of the CIE XYZ color space:\n\nWhen two or more colors are additively mixed, the x and y chromaticity coordinates of the resulting color (x,y) may be calculated from the chromaticities of the mixture components (x,y; x,y; …; x,y) and their corresponding luminances (L, L, …, L) with the following formulas:\n\nThese formulas can be derived from the previously presented definitions of x and y chromaticity coordinates by taking advantage of the fact that the tristimulus values X, Y, and Z of the individual mixture components are directly additive. In place of the luminance values (L, L, etc.) one can alternatively use any other photometric quantity that is directly proportional to the tristimulus value Y (naturally meaning that Y itself can also be used as well).\n\nAs already mentioned, when two colors are mixed, the resulting color x,y will lie on the straight line segment that connects these colors on the CIE xy chromaticity diagram. To calculate the mixing ratio of the component colors x,y and x,y that results in a certain x,y on this line segment, one can use the formula\n\nwhere L is the luminance of color x,y and L the luminance of color x,y. Note that because y is unambiguously determined by x and vice versa, knowing just one or the other of them is enough for calculating the mixing ratio. Also note that, in accordance with the remarks concerning the formulas for x and y, the mixing ratio L/L may well be expressed in terms of other photometric quantities than luminance.\n\nThe CIE RGB color space is one of many RGB color spaces, distinguished by a particular set of monochromatic (single-wavelength) primary colors.\n\nIn the 1920s, two independent experiments on human color perception were conducted by W. David Wright with ten observers, and John Guild with seven observers. Their results laid the foundation for the trichromatic CIE XYZ color space specification.\n\nThe experiments were conducted by using a circular split screen (a bipartite field) 2 degrees in diameter, which is the angular size of the human fovea. On one side a \"test\" color was projected while on the other an observer-adjustable color was projected. The adjustable color was a mixture of three \"primary\" colors, each with fixed chromaticity, but with adjustable brightness.\n\nThe observer would alter the brightness of each of the three primary beams until a match to the test color was observed. Not all test colors could be matched using this technique. When this was the case, a variable amount of one of the primaries could be added to the test color, and a match with the remaining two primaries was carried out with the variable color spot. For these cases, the amount of the primary added to the test color was considered to be a negative value. In this way, the entire range of human color perception could be covered. When the test colors were monochromatic, a plot could be made of the amount of each primary used as a function of the wavelength of the test color. These three functions are called the \"color matching functions\" for that particular experiment.\n\nAlthough Wright and Guild's experiments were carried out using various primaries at various intensities, and although they used a number of different observers, all of their results were summarized by the standardized CIE RGB color matching functions formula_24, formula_25, and formula_26, obtained using three monochromatic primaries at standardized wavelengths of (red), (green) and (blue). The color matching functions are the amounts of primaries needed to match the monochromatic test primary. These functions are shown in the plot on the right (CIE 1931). Note that formula_24 and formula_25 are zero at , formula_24 and formula_26 are zero at and formula_25 and formula_26 are zero at , since in these cases the test color is one of the primaries. The primaries with wavelengths and were chosen because they are easily reproducible monochromatic lines of a mercury vapor discharge. The wavelength, which in 1931 was difficult to reproduce as a monochromatic beam, was chosen because the eye's perception of color is rather unchanging at this wavelength, and therefore small errors in wavelength of this primary would have little effect on the results.\n\nThe color matching functions and primaries were settled upon by a CIE special commission after considerable deliberation. The cut-offs at the short- and long-wavelength side of the diagram are chosen somewhat arbitrarily; the human eye can actually see light with wavelengths up to about , but with a sensitivity that is many thousand times lower than for green light. These color matching functions define what is known as the \"1931 CIE standard observer\". Note that rather than specify the brightness of each primary, the curves are normalized to have constant area beneath them. This area is fixed to a particular value by specifying that\n\nThe resulting normalized color matching functions are then scaled in the r:g:b ratio of 1:4.5907:0.0601 for source luminance and 72.0962:1.3791:1 for source radiance to reproduce the true color matching functions. By proposing that the primaries be standardized, the CIE established an international system of objective color notation.\n\nGiven these scaled color matching functions, the RGB tristimulus values for\na color with a spectral power distribution formula_34 would then be given by:\n\nThese are all inner products and can be thought of as a projection of an infinite-dimensional spectrum to a three-dimensional color.\n\nOne might ask: \"Why is it possible that Wright and Guild's results can be summarized using different primaries and different intensities from those actually used?\" One might also ask: \"What about the case when the test colors being matched are not monochromatic?\" The answer to both of these questions lies in the (near) linearity of human color perception. This linearity is expressed in Grassmann's law.\n\nThe CIE RGB space can be used to define chromaticity in the usual way: The chromaticity coordinates are \"r\", \"g\" and \"b\" where:\n\nHaving developed an RGB model of human vision using the CIE RGB matching functions, the members of the special commission wished to develop another color space that would relate to the CIE RGB color space. It was assumed that Grassmann's law held, and the new space would be related to the CIE RGB space by a linear transformation. The new space would be defined in terms of three new color matching functions\nformula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 as described above. The new color space would be chosen to have the following desirable properties:\n\n\nIn geometrical terms, choosing the new color space amounts to choosing a new triangle in \"rg\" chromaticity space. In the figure above-right, the \"rg\" chromaticity coordinates are shown on the two axes in black, along with the gamut of the 1931 standard observer. Shown in red are the CIE \"xy\" chromaticity axes which were determined by the above requirements. The requirement that the XYZ coordinates be non-negative means that the triangle formed by C, C, C must encompass the entire gamut of the standard observer. The line connecting C and C is fixed by the requirement that the formula_2 function be equal to the luminance function. This line is the line of zero luminance, and is called the alychne. The requirement that the formula_3 function be zero above means that the line connecting C and C must be tangent to the gamut in the region of K. This defines the location of point C. The requirement that the equal energy point be defined by puts a restriction on the line joining C and C, and finally, the requirement that the gamut fill the space puts a second restriction on this line to be very close to the gamut in the green region, which specifies the location of C and C. The above described transformation is a linear transformation from the CIE RGB space to XYZ space. The standardized transformation settled upon by the CIE special commission was as follows:\n\nThe numbers in the conversion matrix below are exact, with the number of digits specified in CIE standards.\n\nWhile the above matrix is exactly specified in standards, going the other direction uses an inverse matrix that is not exactly specified, but is approximately:\n\nThe integrals of the XYZ color matching functions must all be equal by requirement 3 above, and this is set by the integral of the photopic luminous efficiency function by requirement 2 above. The tabulated sensitivity curves have a certain amount of arbitrariness in them. The shapes of the individual \"X\", \"Y\" and \"Z\" sensitivity curves can be measured with a reasonable accuracy. However, the overall luminosity curve (which in fact is a weighted sum of these three curves) is subjective, since it involves asking a test person whether two light sources have the same brightness, even if they are in completely different colors. Along the same lines, the relative magnitudes of the \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" curves are arbitrary. Furthermore, one could define a valid color space with an \"X\" sensitivity curve that has twice the amplitude. This new color space would have a different shape. The sensitivity curves in the CIE 1931 and 1964 XYZ color spaces are scaled to have equal areas under the curves.\n\n\n\n"}

The contour of the ellipse therefore represents the just-noticeable differences of chromaticity. Standard Deviation Color Matching in LED lighting uses deviations relative to MacAdam ellipses to describe color precision of a light source.\n\nIn the study of color perception, the first question that usually comes to mind is, \"What color is it?\" In other words, we wish to develop a method of specifying a particular color which allows us to differentiate it from all other colors. It has been found that three quantities are needed to specify a particular color. The relative amounts of red, green and blue in a color will serve to specify that color completely. This question was first approached by a number of researchers in the 1930s, and their results were formalized in the specification of the CIE XYZ color space.\n\nThe second question we might ask, given two colors, is, \"How different are these two colors?\" Just as the first question was answered by developing a color space in which three numbers specified a particular color, we are now asking effectively, how far apart these two colors are. This particular question was considered by researchers dating back to Helmholtz and Schrödinger, and later in industrial applications, but experiments by Wright and Pitt, and David MacAdam provided much-needed empirical support.\n\nMacAdam set up an experiment in which a trained observer viewed two different colors, at a fixed luminance of about 48 cd/m. One of the colors (the \"test\" color) was fixed, but the other was adjustable by the observer, and the observer was asked to adjust that color until it matched the test color. This match was, of course, not perfect, since the human eye, like any other instrument, has limited accuracy. It was found by MacAdam, however, that all of the matches made by the observer fell into an ellipse on the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram. The measurements were made at 25 points on the chromaticity diagram, and it was found that the size and orientation of the ellipses on the diagram varied widely depending on the test color. These 25 ellipses measured by MacAdam, for a particular observer, are shown on the chromaticity diagram above.\n\nA more general concept is that of \"discrimination ellipsoids\" in the entire three-dimensional color space, which would include the ability of an observer to discriminate between two different luminances of the same color. Such measurements were carried out, among others, by Brown and MacAdam in 1949, Davidson in 1951, Brown in 1957, and by Wyszecki and Fielder in 1971. It was found that the discrimination ellipsoids yielded relatively unchanging discrimination ellipses in chromaticity space for luminances between 3 and 30 cd/m.\n\nMacAdam's results confirmed earlier suspicions that colour difference could be measured using a metric in a chromaticity space. A number of attempts have been made to define a color space which is not as distorted as the CIE XYZ space. The most notable of these are the CIELUV and CIELAB color spaces. Although both of these spaces are less distorted than the CIE XYZ space, they are not completely free of distortion. This means that the MacAdam ellipses become nearly (but not exactly) circular in these spaces.\n\n"}
{"id": "2116022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116022", "title": "Mind-blindness", "text": "Mind-blindness\n\nMind-blindness is a concept of a cognitive divergence where an individual is unable to attribute mental states to others. As a result of this kind of social and empathetic cognitive phenomenon, the individual is incapable of putting themselves \"into someone else's shoes\" and cannot conceptualize, understand or predict knowledge, thoughts and beliefs, emotions, feelings and desires, behaviour, actions and intentions of another person. Such an ability to develop a mental awareness of what is in the other minds is known as the theory of mind (ToM), and the \"mind-blindness\" theory asserts that children who delay in this development often will develop autism. In addition to the research done on autism, ToM and mind-blindness research has recently been extended to other fields such as schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar disorders, antisocial personality disorders as well as normal aging.\n\nMind-blindness is a state where the ToM has not been developed, or has been lost in an individual. According to the theory, ToM is implicit in neurotypical individuals. This enables one to make automatic interpretations of events taking into consideration the mental states of people, their desires and beliefs. Simon Baron-Cohen described how an individual lacking a ToM would perceive the world in a confusing and frightening manner, leading to a withdrawal from society. Since Cohen’s opinion was based on the idea that biology is strictly linked to autistic behavior, he started wondering if a delayed development of the theory of mind would lead to additional psychiatric complications. Moreover, he wondered if there exist multiple degrees of mental blindness.\n\nAn alternative approach to the social impairment observed in mind-blindness focuses on the emotion of subjects. Based on empirical evidence, Uta Frith concluded that the processing of complex cognitive emotions is impaired compared to simpler emotions. In addition, attachment does not seem to fail in the early childhood of autistics. This suggests that emotion is a component of social cognition that is separable from mentalizing.\n\nLombardo and Cohen updated the theory and pinpointed some additional factors that play an important part in ToM of autistic people. They highlighted that the middle cingulate cortex which is outside the traditional mentalizing region was underactive in autistic patients, while the rest of ToM activation was normal. This region was important in deciding how much to invest in a person and hence required mentalization.\n\nScholars have recently wondered if children do possess a theory of mind. Specifically, Wellman and others have wondered if the theory of mind that characterizes adults is somehow different from the one that characterizes children. According to the studies conducted by Wellman, children starting from three years of age, do possess a theory of mind. Wellman is not the only scholar who was interested in discovering about the theory of mind and its divergent characteristics that effect both children and adults. Indeed, scholar Wang, in her work \"Mindful learning: Children’s developing theory of mind and their understanding of the concept of learning\" argues that the “theory of mind development is critical for children to engage in \"mindful learning\", which refers to the learning during which the learner is consciously aware of own mental states and the changes in them, both motivational and epistemic mental states”. Wang was able to demonstrate that children develop theory of mind as they understand how to conceptualize learning. Indeed, Wang argued, during preschool years children become able to consider learning as the “representational knowledge change in the mind”.\n\nAdditionally, Wang was also able to demonstrate that children that belong to divergent cultures develop theory of mind in different ways. Al-Hilawani, Easterbrooks, and Marchant (2002), who tried to understand the phenomenon regarding the development of the theory of mind in children from different cultures, reported that children with hearing loss, and therefore children who could potentially have problems developing the theory of mind, are “similar to hearing children in their ability to learn and reason if they are from the same culture, but not necessarily if the two groups of students are from different cultures”.\n\nNeural correlates of the ToM point towards three regions of the brains. The anterior paracingulate cortex (Brodmann), is considered at the key region of mentalizing. It is located anterior corpus callosum and the anterior cingulate cortex. This cortex is associated with the medial frontal cortex where activation is associated with the mentalization of states. The cells of the ACC develops at the age of 4 months suggesting that the manifestations of mind-blindness may occur around this time.\n\nIn addition to the anterior paracingulate cortex, there is the superior temporal sulcus and the temporal poles that are involved with the ToM and its nature. However, these areas are not uniquely associated with mentalization. They aid in the activation of the regions that are associated with the ToM. The superior temporal sulcus is therefore involved in the processing of behavioural information, while the temporal poles are involved in the retrieval of personal experiences. These are considered important regions for the activation of the ToM regions and are associated with the mind-blindness. The temporal poles provide personal experiences for mentalization such as facial recognition, emotional memory and familiar voices. In patients suffering from semantic dementia, for example, the temporal regions of these patients undergo atrophy and lead to certain deficits which can cause mind-blindness.\nThe amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex also are a part of the ToM. Those mental structures seem to be involved in the interpretation of behavior. It is suspected, in fact, that the damage to the orbitofrontal cortex brings upon subtle impairments, but not a total loss of the ToM that would lead to mind-blindness. Some studies have shown that the orbitofrontal cortex is not directly associated with the theory of the mind or mind-blindness. However, a study by Stone and colleagues were able to show impaired ToM on mentalisation tasks.\n\nSurely, as reported by Gallagher and Firth (2003), neuroimaging plays a significant role “in determining the precise functions of the neural substrates comprising […] the mechanisms underlying theory of mind.” The question that now remains unanswered is if the amygdala and the orbital frontal cortex do play a role in the acquisition of the theory of mind or not.\n\nSince the frontal lobe is associated with executive function, researchers theorize that the frontal lobe plays an important role in ToM and its associated nature. It has also been suggested that the executive function and the theory of mind share the same regions. Despite the fact that ToM and mind-blindness can explain executive function deficits, it is argued that autism is not identified with the failure of the executive function.\n\nLesion studies show that when lesions are imposed to the medial frontal lobe, performance on mentalization tasks is reduced, similar to typical mind-blindness cases. Patients that experienced frontal lobe injuries due to severe head trauma showed signs of mind blindness, as a result of a lost ToM. However, it is still debated whether the inactivation of the medial frontal lobe is involved in mind-blindness.\n\nFrith proposed that a neural network that comprised the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex and the STS, is crucial for the normal functioning of ToM and self monitoring. This so formed dorsal system is crucial for social cognition. Disruption of this neural network leads to mind-blindness in schizophrenic individuals.\n\nAnother element that might give a possible explanation of mind-blindness in people with autism was discussed by Castelli and colleagues. For instance, they were able to show that the connectivity between occipital and the temporo-parietal regions were weaker in the autistic group than the control group. The under activation of this network may inhibit the interactive influences between regions that process higher and lower perceptual items.\n\nIndividuals with autism tend to experience episodes of mind blindness.\n\nAccording to the psychologist Uta Frith, individuals with social and communication impairments, such as who is affected by autism, will experience difficulties in the process of attributing mental states, as desires and beliefs, to themselves or to others. In her article Mind Blindness and Brain in Autism, Frith discusses the differences between mind reading and mind blindness, and how those phenomena are experienced in the mind of a person with autism. Additionally, Frith affirms that individuals that are affected by autism, have “occasionally commented on what they perceive as an unfathomable yet ubiquitous ability of other people to “mind read” during ordinary social interactions. Normal people indeed behave as if they have an implicit theory of mind, and this allows them to explain and predict others’ behavior in terms of their presumed thoughts and feelings”.\n\nTo contrast this idea, Carruthers, in his book Theories of Mind, explains that people affected by autism have more issues than just those argued by the theory of mind, and that those issues do not exclusively involve predicting other individuals’ behavior. Carruthers seems to argue that the “mind-blindness theory has only appeared to be losing out […] , because its proponents have paid insufficient attention to the consequences of their view for the access […]  that autistic people will have to their own mental states.” \n\nMoreover, it is important to say that it has been discovered that lower performance on the mentalization tasks were the first screening task used to diagnose the autism, with a good prediction level.\n\nCohen proposed the mind-blindness theory of autism as \"deficits in the normal process of empathising\". He described empathising to include the ToM, mind reading and taking an intentional stance. According to this view, empathising includes the ability to attribute mental states and to react in an appropriate emotional manner that is appropriate to another's mental state. More deficits tend to occur in reference to one's own mental states compared to the other's mental states. It has been proposed that individuals affected by autism undergo a specific developmental delay in the area of metarepresentational development. Such delay has been demonstrate to facilitate mind-blindness.\n\nThere is some evidence that suggests that certain patients develop a rudimentary ToM and do not suffer from complete lack of ToM causing mind-blindness. A study by Bowler concluded that mind-blindness and social impairment is not as straightforward as previously thought. Such study, for instance, showed that a complete possession of ToM was not enough to protect from social impairments in individuals affected by autism. Conversely, has been demonstrated that the absence or impairment of the ToM that leads to mind-blindness does not lead to social impairments.\n\nThe social and cognitive differences seen in individuals affected by autism are often attributed to mind blindness. Abnormal behaviour of autistic children is therefore perceived to include a lack of reciprocity. Some cases in which mind-blindness is manifested, could include the child being totally withdrawn from social settings as well as the child's incapacity to make eye contact, while he or she may instead attempt to interact with other people. However, global asocial behaviour is not the rule in autism. Cohen described the cognitive/mind-blindness effects in individuals diagnosed with autism as a \"triad of deficits.\" The triad consists of deficits in social, communication and imagination of others' minds.\n\nOzonoff and colleagues were able to discriminate between individuals diagnosed with the Asperger's syndrome and other individuals affected with autism by their ability to solve ToM tasks. This was possible because those diagnosed with AS seem more neurotypical in early childhood development. The siblings of individuals diagnosed with AS were shown to have a lesser variant of ToM deficits. This shows that the cognitive deficits affecting ToM play a central role in the phenotype expressed in AS diagnoses. However, since today’s perceptive about autism and Asperger disorder has changed, Ozonoff research might no longer be considered among other scholars. In fact, the DSM 5 no longer presents the differences between autism and Asperger disorder. Autism is now referred to Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and there are no more differences between all of the subcategories of such disorder. Such subcategories include Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder, and disintegrative disorder. Unfortunately, “despite this change in diagnostic criteria, the number of diagnosed cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is much higher than expected”. As reported by Johnson and Myers (2017), “ASDs are not rare […] In fact, a survey completed in 2004 revealed that 44% of primary care pediatricians reported that they care for at least 10 children with ASDs”.\n\nPeople with schizophrenia also show deficits associated with mind-blindness. In fact, as stated by Brune, “there is good empirical evidence that the theory of minds is specifically impaired in schizophrenia and that many psychotic symptoms—for instance, delusions of alien control and persecution, the presence of thought and language disorganization, and other behavioral symptoms—may best be understood in light of a disturbed capacity in patients to relate their own intentions to executing behavior, and to monitor others’ intentions.” \n\nHowever, there is an ongoing debate as to whether individuals with schizophrenia have an impaired ToM leading to mind-blindness or display an exaggerated ToM. Unlike autism, schizophrenia is a late onset condition. It is speculated that this difference in the condition may account for differences seen in the ToM abilities. Brain lesion studies show that there are differences seen in the laterality of brain that account for mind-blindness. However, it is unknown whether the ToM in schizophrenia deteriorates in the affected person as the condition progresses.\n\nThe cognitive impairment linked to mind-blindness is best explained by a modular theory; the domain specific capabilities that account for mindreading and mentalization are lost in schizophrenia. Some studies conducted at this regard, have been administrated by Cleghorn and Albert (1990), who strived to understand schizophrenia from multiple angles, such as neurobiology, neuropsychology, and cognitive science. They found that despite “individual modules of cognitive and emotional function may be intact in schizophrenia, messages are inappropriately sent to parts of the brain not specialized for the required information […]thus, “modular disjunction” of widely distributed neural systems develops, causing the signs and symptoms of schizophrenic psychosis.” \n\nFurthermore, Frith has predicted that the extent of mind-blindness depends on whether the objective/behavioural or subjective symptoms of ToM abilities prevail. Patients with the behavioural symptoms perform the poorest in ToM tasks, similar to autistic subjects, while patients displaying subjective/experiential symptoms have a ToM. However, these patients are impaired in using contextual information to infer what these mental states are.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to affirm that some scholars have decided to look deeper at Frith’s work and review/ critique her theory. In fact, in their work \"Theory of mind in schizophrenia: A critical review\", Professors Harrington, Siegert, and McClure (2005), have affirmed that the theory proposed by Uta Frith has not few issues that need to be redirected. For instance, “issues that demand further clarification include: Is the deficit a state or a trait? How to measure ToM in schizophrenia research, and whether certain symptoms or groups of symptoms are associated with the ToM deficit\".\n\nThe mind-blindness theory helps to explain the impairment in the social development of individuals as well as the impairment in the communication skills of autistics. However one of the most important limitations of this theory is that it is unable to explain the highly repetitive behaviours which is a characteristic trait attributed to autistic people. This triad is explained through the process of systemising. The theory also did not account for the motor problems and the superior rote memory skills that were associated with autism. These aspects along with the highly repetitive behaviours formed the triad of strengths. Simon Baron-Cohen himself has acknowledged that the theory, while adept at explaining the communications difficulties experienced by autistic people, fails to explain such patients' penchants for narrowly defined interests, an important step to proper diagnosis. Furthermore, mind-blindness seems decidedly non-unique to autistic people, since conditions ranging from schizophrenia to various narcissistic personality disorders and/or anti-social personality disorders all exhibit mind-blindness to some degree.\n\nAnother issue associated with the mind-blindness theory is that researchers are unable to predict whether the social deficits are a primary or secondary result of mind-blindness. In addition, Klin and his fellow researchers highlighted another limitation that was that the mind-blindness theory failed to delineate whether the ToM deficits are a generalised deficit or a specific discrete of a mechanism. Stuart Shanker also argued in favour of Klin's argument, that a major part of the mind-blindness theory depicts the ToM as an autonomous cognitive capacity compared to being part of a more general ability for reflective thinking and empathy. \nOther researchers have pointed out the inherent flaws of assuming autistic traits develops from a \"theory of mind\" deficit, pointing out that this presupposes autistic traits derives from a single, core insufficiency within the brain. This contrasts, they say, with the very same researchers' description of autism as a \"puzzle\", which implies a far more diverse range of causes than a single, unifying theory.\n\nMany have also pointed out that Mind-blindness wrongly categorizes autism as a problem to be fixed, rather than a condition to be accommodated. This assumes an inherent lack of intelligence in individuals affected by autism, which ignores the nuanced view of intelligence (as in varying types of intelligence) that has been observed in cognitive research.\n\nThe drawbacks in the Mind-blindness theory of individuals diagnosed with autism paved way for the E-S theory which helps to explain the observations seen in these individuals. The E-S theory accounts for both the triad of deficits which is the loss of empathising and the triad of strengths is related to hyper systemisation of certain behaviours. The theory also helps to explain the exaggerated male spectrum termed as the extreme male behavior.\n\n\n"}

Council members serve four-year terms.\n\nWiener Linien operate bus and tram (\"Straßenbahn\") surface routes, and partly underground, partly overground metro or underground train lines (Vienna U-Bahn).\n\nThe U-Bahn network is being steadily expanded, and to a lesser extent the bus routes, especially in outlying areas of the city. U-Bahn ridership is likewise growing strongly, but in contrast tram ridership is slightly lower and there has been a reduction in tram mileage in recent years (from in 2004 to in 2007).\n\n\nThe system is supplemented by 26 bus routes operated by subcontractors who also operate their own routes in and around Vienna. In addition there are 7 routes of Demand responsive transport. Wiener Linien services also connect to mainline ÖBB trains and the Vienna S-Bahn.\n\nMost daytime services run between 5:00 am and 0:30 am. During rush hours, many routes run at intervals of two to five minutes; during evening hours, the U-Bahn runs at 7 and a half minute intervals and trams and buses every ten or 15 minutes. Between 0:30 and 5:00 am, night bus routes run every 15 to 30 minutes. Following a February 2010 plebiscite, nighttime U-Bahn service on weekends at 15-minute intervals is to be instituted in September 2010.\n\nWiener Linien fares are integrated into the VOR (\"Verkehrsverbund Ost-Region\", East Region Transportation Association); their routes all lie within its core zone (Zone 100). Schoolchildren, students, the unemployed, and pensioners are served at considerably reduced prices.\n\nThe Vienna U-Bahn has existed under this name since 1976, when the stretch of the 1898–1901 Wiener Stadtbahn (Vienna Metropolitan Railway) between Heiligenstadt and Friedensbrücke stations was experimentally adapted and placed in operation as Line U4. The construction of a metro in Vienna had been preceded by decades of political debate, since the Social Democratic majority in Vienna had initially preferred other modes of transit. The first stretch of newly constructed U-Bahn rail was placed in operation in 1978 (U1 from Reumannplatz to Karlsplatz). The Vienna U-Bahn system currently consists of five lines, is long and has 84 stations:\n\nThe \"Wiener Straßenbahn\" (Vienna tramway) has existed since 1865, when the first horsedrawn tram went into service; the first line was electrified in 1897. Originally operated by private transport firms, the tramway was purchased by the city government around 1900 and in the years that followed massively expanded under the name \"Gemeinde Wien - Städtische Straßenbahnen\" (Municipality of Vienna - City Tramways). Electrified at the city's expense, the trams were integrated into the transport network in 1925. Until construction of the U-Bahn, the trams were the primary mode of public transport in Vienna.\n\nAfter 1945, numerous tram lines were abandoned because of increasing use of private cars or converted to bus routes because of economic unviability. Beginning in 1978, in the course of construction of the U-Bahn, tram routes parallelling U-Bahn routes were introduced. Nonetheless, the tram system in Vienna remains one of the most extensive in the world. 28 routes currently operate on of rail. Further cutbacks are expected in the next few years as the U-Bahn continues to expand; however, extensions and new lines are also planned, above all in the 21st and 22nd districts.\n\nThe Municipality of Vienna has operated bus lines since the 1920s; they increased in importance after suburban development increased demand for transport connections and after many tram lines in densely built-up areas were replaced by bus service.\n\nCurrently approximately 500 buses are in operation on 43 daytime and 23 nighttime routes along approximately of streets, carrying approximately 120 million passengers a year. Vienna Linien bus routes are designated with A (for \"Autobus\") to distinguish them at a glance from tram routes. Additional bus routes within Zone 100 of the \"Verkehrsverbund Ost-Region\", most of which are operated by other companies, such as Dr. Richard, and for which VOR tickets are also valid, are designated with B to distinguish them.\n\nIn 2005, Wiener Linien received the negative Big Brother Award in the People's Choice category because of camera surveillance.\n\n"}

The size of a morgen varies from . It was also used in Old Prussia, in the Balkans, Norway and Denmark, where it was equal to about \n\nThe word is usually taken to be the same as the German and Dutch word for \"morning\" or \"tomorrow\". Similarly to the Imperial acre, it was approximately the amount of land tillable in the morning hours of a day by one man behind an ox or horse dragging a single bladed plough. The \"morgen\" was commonly set at about 60–70% of the \"tagwerk\" (literally \"day work\") referring to a full day of ploughing. In 1869, the North German Confederation fixed the morgen at a but in modern times most farmland work is measured in full hectares. The next lower measurement unit was the German \"rute\" or Imperial rod but the metric rod length of never became popular. The morgen is still used in Taiwan today, called \"kah\"; 1 kah is roughly .\n\nThe following table shows an excerpt of morgen sizes as used in Germany - some morgen were used in a wider area and so they had proper names. The actual area of a morgen was considerably larger in fertile areas of Germany, or in regions where flat terrain prevails, presumably facilitating tilling. The next lower measurement unit to a morgen was usually in \"Quadratruten\" square rods.\n\nThe Polish terms for the unit were \"morga, mórg, jutrzyna\", the latter being a near-literal translation into old Polish.\n\nThe term morgen was used in the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria where 1 morgen was equal to .\n\nUntil the advent of metrication in the 1970s, the morgen was the legal unit of measure of land in three of the four pre-1995 South African provinces – the Cape Province, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal. In November 2007 the South African Law Society published a conversion factor of \"1 morgen = 0.856 532 hectares\" to be used \"for the conversion of areas from imperial units to metric, particularly when preparing consolidated diagrams by compilation\".\n\n"}

The village has been a centre of the pottery trade, especially faïence, for centuries. A spring flows out of the cliff and creates a waterfall in town, providing water power.\n\nThe village was built on platform terraces a hundred or so metres up the side of a limestone cliff.

Its origin, according to a legend popularised by Provençal poet Frédéric Mistral, lies in the 10th century; the original star and chain have been replaced several times since then. The current star is about 50 years old. Ten years ago it fell after the chain snapped, and was rehung using a helicopter.\n\nAccording to the legend, during the Crusades the knight Bozon de Blacas was held prisoner by the Saracens; he vowed to hang a star over his village if he was able to return.

He stood unsuccessfully for the position of Lord Speaker in the British House of Lords in 2011, the first ever non-UK born candidate to do so. He has been awarded the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award in the Republic of India, in 2008.\n\nBorn in Vadodara, Gujarat, India, Desai grew up with two brothers and one sister. He is said to have gone to secondary school at age seven and matriculated at 14. He secured a bachelor's degree in Economics from Ramnarain Ruia College and then pursued a master's degree in Economics from the University of Mumbai, after which he won a scholarship to University of Pennsylvania in August 1960. He completed his PhD in Economics at Pennsylvania in 1963.\n\nCurrently, Desai is chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) Advisory Board, an independent membership-driven research network. It focuses on global policy and investment themes for off the record public and private sector engagement and analysis. He is the current chairman of the Meghnad Desai Academy of Economics, a post-graduation institute in Mumbai.\n\nPreviously, Desai has worked as an Associate Specialist in the Department of Agricultural Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California. He then became a lecturer at the London School of Economics in 1965. At the LSE, he taught econometrics, macroeconomics, Marxian economics and development economics over the years.\n\nDesai wrote his first book \"Marxian Economic Theory\" in 1973 followed by \"Applied Econometrics\" in 1976 and \"Marxian Economics\", a revised edition of his 1973 book in 1979. He wrote \"Testing Monetarism\", a critique of monetarism, in 1981.\n\nIn the 1970s, he taught an idiosyncratic version of economic principles to freshers at the LSE (starting with Piero Sraffa).\n\nDesai has written extensively publishing over 200 articles in academic journals and had a regular column in the British radical weekly \"Tribune\" during 1985–1994, in the Indian business daily \"Business Standard\" (1995–2001) and in \"Indian Express\" and \"Financial Express\". From 1984 to 1991, he was co-editor of the \"Journal of Applied Econometrics\". A selection of his academic papers was published in two volumes as \"The Selected Essays of Meghnad Desai\" in 1995.\n\nDesai has been active in the British Labour Party, becoming chairman between 1986 and 1992, and was made Honorary Lifetime and President of Islington South and Finsbury Constituency Labour Party in London. He was created a life peer as Baron Desai, \"of St Clement Danes in the City of Westminster\", on 5 June 1991. He is a member of Labour Friends of Israel.\nIn 2002, Desai's book \"Marx's Revenge: The Resurgence of Capitalism and the Death of Statist Socialism\" stated that globalisation would tend toward the revival of socialism. Desai analyses some of Marx's lesser known writings and argues that his theories enhance our understanding of modern capitalism and globalization. His work was well received, with The Guardian stating 'If only socialists had studied Marx properly, they would have known all along that capitalism would triumph. Meghnad Desai gets behind the slogans in Marx's Revenge'.\n\nDesai published a biography of Indian film star Dilip Kumar entitled \"Nehru's Hero: Dilip Kumar in the life of India\" (Roli, 2004). He has described the book as his \"greatest achievement\". Examining Kumar's films – some of which Desai has seen more than 15 times – he discovers parallels between the socio-political arena in India and its reflection on screen. He discusses issues as varied as censorship, the iconic values of Indian machismo, cultural identity and secularism, and analyses how the films portrayed a changing India at that time.\n\nIn 2003, Desai retired as Director of the Centre for the Study of global governance, which he founded in 1992 at the London School of Economics (LSE), where he is now Professor Emeritus. He was Chairman of the Trustee's Board for Training for Life, Chairman of the Management Board of City Roads and on the Board of \"Tribune\" magazine. Lord Desai was also a founding member of the Development Studies Institute (DESTIN) at the LSE in 1990.\n\nDesai retired from the LSE in 2003. Since then he has published \"Rethinking Islamism: Ideology of the New Terror\" (2006), \"The Route to All Evil: The Political Economy of Ezra Pound\" (2007), a novel \"Dead on Time\", (2009) and \"The Rediscovery of India\" (2009).\n\nLord Desai serves as the founder chairman of the Meghnad Desai Academy of Economics in Mumbai (MDAE). MDAE offers a one-year post-graduate diploma in economics, offered jointly with Department of Economics (Autonomous), University of Mumbai. MDAE focuses on applied learning and case studies rather than on rote learning. Students will participate in workshops and seminars with top economics and finance professionals from around the world.\n\nIn 2007, Desai was asked by the University of London to serve with Tony McGrew of the University of Southampton as one of the two examiners of the PhD thesis of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the then leader of Libya. They did not immediately accept the thesis, as it was found to be weak. The candidate was subjected to an oral examination for two and a half hours and Gaddafi was asked to revise and re-submit it. The revised version was subsequently accepted.\n\nAs Desai had already retired from the LSE he had no involvement with the donation from Saif Gaddafi's charity to the LSE. Learning from the press of these links between LSE and Libya, Desai demanded that the money be returned to the people of Libya. He expressed disappointment at a speech Saif Gaddafi subsequently made on Libyan state television declaring the Gaddafi family's willingness to \"fight to the last bullet\", observing that \"he was not behaving as if he had had an LSE education.\"\n\nLord (Meghnad) Desai is Chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) Advisory Board, an independent financial think tank which serves as a neutral, non-lobbying platform for exchanges among official institutions and private sector counterparties worldwide.\n\nIn 1970, Desai married his LSE colleague Gail Wilson, his first wife. She was the daughter of George Ambler Wilson, CBE. They had three children.\n\nDuring the course of writing \"Nehru's Hero\", Desai met Kishwar Ahluwalia (now Kishwar Desai), his second wife who worked as an editor for this book. On 20 July 2004 the couple married. Desai and 47-year-old Ahluwalia were both divorced and married at a registrar's office in London.\n\nDesai is an atheist. He is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society.\n\n\nhttp://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/LSEMagazine/pdf/summer2004/biographySpread.pdf LSE Biography]\n"}
