The Czech libretto was written by Karel Sabina, and is based on events from Czech history. The work was composed in the years 1862–1863. Smetana and Sabina wrote the opera at a time of great Czech patriotism, with the pending opening of a new theatre for production of Czech operas in Prague.\n\nThe opera received its first performance at the Provisional Theater (or the \"Interim Theatre\"), Prague, on 5 January 1866, and the first performance was a success. The first UK performances were in April 1978 by Hammersmith Municipal Opera.\n\nUpon the death of King Ottokar II in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, his widow Kunigunda had called in the Brandenburgian troops to lend aid against the army of victorious Rudolph of Habsburg. Rudolph retired to Austria, nevertheless the Brandenburgers soon acted like occupants: they arrested Kunigunda and her seven-year-old son Wenceslaus at Bezděz Castle and agreed with Rudolph that they would retain the Bohemian rule for the next five years.\n\nThe Prague people led by mayor Volfram Olbramovič suffer from the Brandenburg occupation. The citizen Junoš reports on plundering and looting Brandenburgian troops. Ludiše, the mayor's daughter, rejects the approaches made by the German townsman Jan Tausendmark, who thereupon joins the occupants. The serf Jíra is designated the leader of a rebel movement. He openly charges Tausendmark with the kidnapping of the three daughters of the mayor, Ludiše, Vlčenka and Děčana. To avoid clashes of arms, Olbramovič has Jíra arrested. The mayor's daughters are kept by Brandenburg troops and Olbramovič asks Tausendmark to arrange for their liberation. However, the Brandenburg captain Varnemann demands a high ransom. Meanwhile, Jíra is put on trial and condemned to death. However, it is Junoš, in love with Ludiše, who manages to save Jíra. Tausendmark, who intends to abduct Ludiše, fails to reach an agreement with Varnemann. He and the Brandenburgers are driven out of Prague, and the city is liberated.\n\nWhile taking place in a distant historical time, the opera presents heroic Czechs struggling to shake off the oppressive rule of German-speaking occupiers - a theme obviously attractive to a Nationalist Czech audience. However, the opera's villains are not the Habsburg Austrians who actually ruled Bohemia at the time when the opera was written and performed. Rather, they are from Brandenburg - the lineal ancestor of Prussia, Austria's main rival; in January 1866, when the opera was presented, tensions between Austria and Prussia were at their peak, and a few months later would culminate in a a major war. Thus, Austrian censors had no strong reason to object to an opera presenting Brandenburgers as villains \n\n\n\n\n"}

McKee is best known for her role as Sister Williams in the original 1976 musical-drama film \"Sparkle\". McKee also had notable roles in such movies as \"The Cotton Club\", \"Jungle Fever\", \"ATL\" and \"Honey\".\n\nBorn in Detroit, Michigan, McKee was the second of three daughters of Dorothy McKee, of Swedish descent, and Lonnie McKee, an African American bricklayer and auto manufacturer employee.McKee's older sister, Katherine \"Kathy\" McKee, is also an actress and performer. McKee attended St Martin De Porres High School, but left after her freshman year, moving to Los Angeles, California, to live with her older sister.\n\nMcKee's career began in the music business in Detroit as a child prodigy, where she started writing music/lyrics, singing, playing keyboards and performing at the age of seven. In 1968, McKee, then aged 14, recorded her first record entitled \"Don't Worry About It\". It became an instant regional pop/R&B hit. McKee wrote the title song for the film \"Quadroon\", in which her sister Katherine McKee starred, when she was fifteen.\n\nSeveral years later, McKee was launched to stardom with her critically acclaimed performance in the hit 1976 musical drama film \"Sparkle\". She has written and produced three solo LPs. \"Natural Love\" was produced for Spike Lee's Columbia 40 Acres and A Mule label in 1992. Ed Hogan, reviewing for \"AllMusic\", wrote, \"'Natural Love' shows that the singer/songwriter's muse knows no stylistic bounds. As with her earlier effort, McKee co-writes all of the songs while sharing production credits with Bryant McNeil, Gene Lake Jr., and labelmate Raymond Jones of State of Art.\" McKee scored the music for the well-received cable documentary on the Lower Manhattan African Burial Ground, as well as numerous infomercials. McKee has toured extensively throughout the world singing concert performances, including the JVC Jazz Festival at Carnegie Hall. McKee studied film directing at The New School in New York and apprenticed directing with the filmmaker Spike Lee.

{"id": "2022029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022029", "title": "Wanda Gág", "text": "Wanda Gág\n\nWanda Hazel Gág (March 11, 1893–June 27, 1946) was an American artist, author, translator, and illustrator. She is best known for writing and illustrating the children's book \"Millions of Cats\", the oldest American picture book still in print. Gág was also a noted printmaker, receiving international recognition and awards. \"Growing Pains\", excerpts from the diaries of her teen and young adult years, received widespread critical acclaim. Some of her books have been awarded Newbery Honors and Caldecott Honors.\n\nBorn March 11, 1893, in the German-speaking community of New Ulm, Minnesota, to Elisabeth Biebl Gag and the artist and photographer Anton Gag, Gág was the eldest of seven children. When still a teen, her illustrated story \"Robby Bobby in Mother Goose Land\" was published in \"The Minneapolis Journal\" in their \"Junior Journal\" supplement.\n\nWhen she was 15, her father died of tuberculosis; his final words to her were: \"Was der Papa nicht thun konnt', muss die Wanda halt fertig machen.\" (What Papa couldn't do, Wanda will have to finish.) Following Anton's death the Gag family was on welfare and some townspeople thought that Wanda should quit high school and get a steady job to help support her family. Despite this pressure, Wanda continued with her high school education. After graduating in June, 1912 she taught country school in Springfield, Minnesota, from November 1912 to June 1913.\n\nIn 1913 Gág began a platonic relationship with University of Minnesota medical student Edgar T. Herrmann who exposed her to new ideas in art, politics and philosophy. With a scholarship (and the aid of friends), she attended The Saint Paul School of Art in 1913 and 1914. From 1914 to 1917 she attended The Minneapolis School of Art under the patronage of Herschel V. Jones. While there, she became friends with Harry Gottlieb and Adolf Dehn. In 1917 Gág won a scholarship to the Art Students League of New York where she took classes in composition, etching and advertising illustration. In that same year Gág completed her first illustrated book commission (\"A Child’s Book of Folk-Lore— Mechanics of Written English\" by Jean Sherwood Rankin.)\n\nBy 1919 Gág was earning her living as a commercial illustrator. In 1921 she became a partner in a business venture called \"Happiwork Story Boxes\"; boxes decorated with story panels on its sides. An illustration of Gág's was published in \"\" in 1921. Gág's art exhibition in the New York Public Library in 1923 was her first solo show.\n\nAround this time she began using an accent mark in her last name to indicate its proper pronunciation: \"Gahg\".\n\nIn 1924 Gág published a short-lived folio-style magazine with artist William Gropper. In 1925 her series of illustrated crossword puzzles for children was syndicated in several newspapers. Gág's one-woman-show in the Weyhe Gallery in 1926 led to her being acclaimed as \"… one of America’s most promising young graphic artists… \" and was the start of a lifelong relationship with its manager, Carl Zigrosser. Gág began to sell numerous lithographs, linoleum block prints, water colors and drawings through the gallery.\n\nIn 1927 her article \"These Modern Women: A Hotbed of Feminists\" was published in \"The Nation\", drawing the attention of Alfred Stieglitz and prompting the publisher and designer Egmont Arens to write: \"The way you solved that problem (her relationship with men) seems to me to be the most illuminating part of your career. You have done what all the other ‘modern women’ are still talking about.\" Gág’s illustrations were published on the covers of the leftist magazines \"The New Masses\" and \"The Liberator\".\n\nIn 1928 Gág hand-colored some of Rockwell Kent's illustrations in a limited edition of \"Candide\". In a 1929 \"New York Times\" review, Elisabeth Luther Cary described Gág's print \"Stone Crusher\": \"Pure imagination leaps out from dusky shadows and terrifies with light, an emotional source difficult to analyze.\" Her work was recognized internationally and was selected for inclusion in the American Institute of Graphic Arts \"Fifty Prints of the Year\" in 1928, 1929, 1931, 1932, 1936, 1937 and 1938. Gág's work was shown at The Museum of Modern Art 1939 exhibition \"Art in Our Time\" and the 1939 New York World's Fair \"American Art Today\" show.. \n\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic that prompted the temporary closure of many U.S. museums, the Philadelphia Museum of Art featured Gág in an online exhibit which featured works that she drew on sandpaper in rural New Jersey during the 1920s and '30s. She used the sparkly and gritty quality of the sandpaper to draw out the rustic quality of her everyday, rustic subjects, such as shoes drying on a cardboard box next to a stove.\n\nIn 1927 Gág's illustrated story \"Bunny's Easter Egg\" was published in John Martin's Book magazine for children. Gág's work caught the attention of Ernestine Evans, director of Coward-McCann's children's book division. Evans was delighted to learn that Gág had children's stories and illustrations in her folio and asked her to submit her own story with illustrations. The result, \"Millions of Cats\", had been developed from a story that Gág had written to entertain the children of friends. It was published in 1928. Anne Carol Moore (in the New York Herald Tribune) wrote: \"… It bears all the hallmarks of becoming a perennial favorite among children, and it takes a place of its own, both for the originality and strength of its pictures and the living folk-tale quality of its text. A book of universal interest to children living anywhere in the world.\" \"Millions of Cats\" is on the New York Public Library's list of 100 Great Children's Books.\n\nIn 1935 Gág published the \"proto-feminist\" \"Gone is Gone; or, the Story of a Man Who Wanted to Do Housework\".\n\nTo encourage the reading of fairy-tales, Gág translated and illustrated \"Tales from Grimm\" in 1936. English critic Humbert Wolfe, commenting on Gág's translation, wrote: \"From the very first page it was clear that Miss Gág was chopping away a perfect brushwood of clumsy phraseology to let in the light.\" Two years later she translated and illustrated the Grimm story \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" in reaction to the \"trivialized, sterilized, and sentimentalized\" Disney movie version. Her essay \"I Like Fairy Tales\" was published in the March 1939 issue of \"The Horn Book Magazine\". \"More Tales from Grimm\" was published posthumously in 1947. Four of her translated fairy tales were later released with illustrations by Margot Tomes.\n\nGág liked to live and work in the country. In the early 1920s she spent summers drawing at various locations in rural New York and Connecticut. She rented a three-acre farm (\"Tumble Timbers\") in Glen Gardner, New Jersey from 1925 to 1930 and later purchased a larger farm (“All Creation”) in Milford, New Jersey in 1931.\n\nShe continued to support her unmarried adult siblings, some of whom lived with her from time to time. Gág's brother Howard did the hand lettering for most of her picture books and she also encouraged her sister Flavia to create illustrated books for children.\n\nIn addition to Earle Humphreys (her long-time paramour and business manager), Gág also had other lovers, at times simultaneously: Adolph Dehn, Lewis Gannett, Carl Zigrosser, and Dr. Hugh Darby. She married Humphreys on August 27, 1943.\n\nIn 1946 Gág died from lung cancer in New York City.\n\nGág is widely considered to be a pioneer in the development of the picture book form. Prior to \"Millions of Cats\", illustrated books generally had text on the left page with pictures on the right. Gag integrated the text with the pictures while sometimes stretching them across a double page.\n\nSome of the artists inspired by Wanda Gág are Eric Rohmann, Ursula Dubosarsky, Susan Marie Swanson, Jan Brett, Maurice Sendak, and Ray Johnson.\n\nGág was honored by \"The Horn Book Magazine\" in a tribute issue in 1947. Her childhood home in New Ulm, Minnesota has been restored and is now the Wanda Gág House, a museum and interpretive center that offers tours and educational programs. In 1992 \"Millions of Cats\" was featured on the television series \"Shelly Duvall's Bedtime Stories\", narrated by James Earl Jones. A bronze sculpture of Gág (with one of her cats) was erected at the public library of New Ulm, Minnesota in 2016. In 2017 The Sandbox Theatre in Minneapolis produced \"In The Treetops\", a new play that focused on Gág's childhood years.\n\nThe books \"Millions of Cats\" and \"The ABC Bunny\" were recipients of a Newbery Honor. Both \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" and \"Nothing at All\" received a Caldecott Honor. Wanda was posthumously honored with The Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958 and The Kerlan Award in 1977. The Wanda Gág Read Aloud Book Award is awarded each year by the University of Minnesota, Moorhead. In 2018, Gág was posthumously honored with The Museum of Illustration at the Society of Illustrators Original Art Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nGág's prints, drawings, and watercolors are in the collections of The National Gallery of Art, the British Museum, The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, The Whitney Museum and other museums around the world. Gág's papers, manuscripts and matrices are held in the Kerlan Collection at the University of Minnesota, The New York Public Library, The University of Pennsylvania, The Free Library of Philadelphia and the Minneapolis Institute of Art.\n\nWriter and illustrator:\n\nTranslator and illustrator:\n\nIllustrator only:\n\nTranslator only:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2022036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022036", "title": "Closed-eye hallucination", "text": "Closed-eye hallucination\n\nClosed-eye hallucinations and closed-eye visualizations (CEV) are a distinct class of hallucination. These types of hallucinations generally only occur when one's eyes are closed or when one is in a darkened room. They can be a form of phosphene. Some people report closed-eye hallucinations under the influence of psychedelics. These are reportedly of a different nature than the \"open-eye\" hallucinations of the same compounds. Similar hallucinations that occur due to loss of vision are called visual release hallucinations.\n\nThere are five known levels of CEV perception which can be achieved either through chemical stimuli or through meditative relaxation techniques. Level 1 and 2 are very common and often happen every day. It is still normal to experience level 3, and even level 4, but only a small percentage of the population does this without psychedelic drugs, meditation or extensive visualization training.\n\nThe most basic form of CEV perception that can be immediately experienced in normal waking consciousness involves a seemingly random noise of pointillistic light/dark regions with no apparent shape or order.\n\nThis can be seen when the eyes are closed and looking at the back of the eyelids. In a bright room, a dark red can be seen, owing to a small amount of light penetrating the eyelids and taking on the color of the blood it has passed through. In a dark room, blackness can be seen or the object can be more colourful. But in either case it is not a flat unchanging redness/blackness. Instead, if actively observed for a few minutes, one becomes aware of an apparent disorganized motion, a random field of lightness/darkness that overlays the redness/blackness of closed eyelids.\n\nFor a person who tries to actively observe this closed-eye perception on a regular basis, there comes a point where if they look at a flat-shaded object with their eyes wide open, and try to actively look for this visual noise, they will become aware of it and see the random pointillistic disorganized motion as if it were a translucent overlay on top of what is actually being seen by their open eyes.\n\nWhen seen overlaid onto the physical world, this CEV noise does not obscure physical vision at all, and in fact is hard to notice if the visual field is highly patterned, complex, or in motion. When active observation is stopped, it is not obvious or noticeable, and seemingly disappears from normal physical perception. Individuals suffering from visual snow see similar noise but experience difficulty blocking it from conscious perception.\n\nSome mental control can be exerted over these closed-eye visualizations, but it usually requires a bit of relaxation and concentration to achieve. \nWhen properly relaxed it is possible to cause regions of intense black, bright white or even colors such as yellow, green, or pink to appear in the noise. These regions can span the entire visual field, but seem to be fleeting in nature.\n\nThis level is relatively easily accessible to people who use psychedelic drugs such as LSD. However, it is also accessible to people involved in deep concentration for long periods of time. When lying down at night and closing the eyes, right before sleep or just before waking up, the complex motion of these patterns can become directly visible without any great effort thanks to hypnagogic hallucination.\nThe patterns themselves might resemble fractals.\n\nThis is a fairly deep state. At this level, thoughts visually manifest as objects or environments. When this level is reached, the CEV noise seems to calm down and fade away, leaving behind an intense flat ordered blackness. The visual field becomes a sort of active space. A side component of this is the ability to feel motion when the eyes are closed.\n\nOpening the eyes returns one to the normal physical world, but still with the CEV object field overlaid onto it and present. In this state it is possible to see things that appear to be physical objects in the open-eye physical world, but that aren't really there.\nThis level can be entered from complete sensory deprivation, as experienced in an isolation tank, but even there it requires great relaxation.\n\nAccording to lucid dreaming researcher Stephen LaBerge, perceptions can come from either the senses or imagination. An inhibitory system involving the thalamus, likely involving serotonergic neurons, inhibits imaginary perceptions from becoming too activated so they turn into hallucinations. This system is inhibited during REM sleep, and the imagination can freely run into the perceptual systems. What happens at level 5 is likely that this system is inhibited, just like in REM sleep, by different causes like sensory deprivation, psychedelic drugs or meditative relaxation techniques.\n\nImage burn-in occurs when very bright objects lie in one's field of vision, and should not be confused with closed-eye hallucinations. Visual burn-in from bright lights is visible for a few minutes after closing the eyes, or by blinking repeatedly, but the burn-in effect slowly fades away as the retina recovers, whereas the waking-consciousness CEV noise will not disappear if observed continuously over a period of time.\n\nCEV does not involve the liquid and air bubbles on the surface of the cornea, which can also be seen by extremely nearsighted people when looking at bright point-light sources with glasses/contacts removed. Also called \"floaters\", they often appear as cells floating across the eye. Full-closing and reopening the eyelids creates a very definite wiper-ridge in the corneal liquid that is readily visible. Fully closing and reopening the eyelids also stirs up the corneal liquid which settles down after a brief moment. The motion of waking-consciousness CEV noise is not so directly and physically controllable and repeatable. This is not necessarily only associated with extreme nearsightedness.\n\nCEV does not seem to be related to the \"sprites\" (blue field entoptic phenomenon) that can be seen as dots darting around when staring up into a bright blue sky on a sunny day (not looking at the sun). These dots superimposed over a flat blue background are white blood cells moving through the blood vessels of the retina. The motion of waking-consciousness CEV noise is uniformly random compared to the waking-consciousness blue-sky sprite motion.\n\nCEV is unrelated to the visual noise seen when the retina is physically stimulated. The retina can be made to produce light patterns of visual noise simply by one rubbing their eyes somewhat forcefully in a manner that increases intraocular pressure. Additionally, retinal noise can be produced by touching near the rear of the eyeball producing pressure phosphenes (for example, if one closes one's eyes, looks all the way left, and lightly touches the rightmost part of the eye socket, this produces visual noise in the shape of a circle that appears at the left side of the visual \nfield – a practice that is neither painful nor dangerous). None of these are closed-eye hallucinations.\n\n"}

Both series were released in the United States by ADV Films.\n\nIn \"Gravion\", Eiji Shigure is sent a letter from his missing older sister Ayaka Shigure. His search for her leads him to Klein Sandman, a mysterious billionaire and Eiji secretly infiltrates his enormous \"Saint-Germain Castle\" while he is hosting a party for Earth Federation Alliance (EFA) leaders, in order to find her. He ends up piloting the \"G-Attacker\", a vehicle that is one of five machines, called \"Gran Diva\"s, secretly created by Sandman himself, during a mission of Sandman's Earthgertz team to defeat the invading mechanical extraterrestrials called the Zeravire. Sandman explains to Eiji his unique \"G-Factor\" allows him to pilot the Gran Divas such as the G-Attacker and his sister, who also had the G-Factor, was secretly part of Earthgertz. When she disappeared while on a mission, Sandman was forced to send the letter to Eiji to bring him there in order to recruit him onto the team. Although only interested in finding his sister, Eiji becomes part of Earthgertz, who are the planet's only defensive team able to prevent the Zeravire from destroying humanity, by combining the vehicular Gran Divas with the \"Gran Kaiser\" mecha to form the titular super robot, Gravion.\n\nIn \"Gravion Zwei\", the Zeravire invasion seems to have stopped. However, when it rises back up all of a sudden, the Earthgertz and its trump card Gravion, is needed to defend the Earth again. In the meantime, the EFA creates their own weapons to counter the Zeravire, the Gran Trooper. As they attempt to fend off the Zeravire, the Earthgertz and the EFA must set aside their differences, confront their pasts and unveil the mysteries of the Zeravire, in order to end their impending threat once and for all.\n\nProtagonist of the series, 17-year-old Eiji Shigure is searching for his older sister Ayaka Shigure, after he receives a letter from her. Upon finding information she is last seen in service to billionaire Klein Sandman, Eiji enters Sandman's Saint-Germain Castle to find her, but is unknowingly recruited into the Earthgertz as pilot of the Gran Diva, the G-Attacker. He reluctantly stays with the Earthgertz to assume piloting responsibilities, but above all, will leave once he finds Ayaka in Sandman's castle. In \"Gravion Zwei\", he pilots the \"Geo Mirage\".\n\nEasily angered, Eiji carries a short temper (which makes him quite easy to manipulate) and is annoyed by the carefree and clueless Toga, the other boy in the castle, who has no outside interaction prior to Eiji's arrival, or the feisty Luna, who picks on him for not being more like Toga. Regardless, Eiji is reasonable in his rash decisions and develops a close friendship with the rest of his teammates, knowing firsthand how real the Zeravire threat is, thus willing to see the menacing mechanical beings stopped by helping the Earthgertz in their mission. \n\nAn energetic, friendly 14-year-old girl, Luna Gusuku teases Eiji for her amusement and befuddles him for not being as straight and decent like Touga. One of two pilots of the \"G-Driller\" Gran Diva and born in Okinawa, she came to Klein Sandman's castle at a young age, meeting Toga Tenkuuji first. Her father \"Isana Gusuku\" disappears while working for the billionaire, and has since stayed in Sandman's castle, eventually enrolling into the Earthgertz. In \"Gravion Zwei\", she pilots the \"Geo Javelin\". \n\nThe only other boy in Klein Sandman's castle, 17-year-old Touga Tenkuuji is a very kind and gentle person with a smile almost always on his face. Toga claims he has been inside the castle all his life, never knowing any other human interaction besides the Earthgertz and Sandman's countless maids. Extremely athletic and physically strong, he is the pilot of the Gran Kaiser, the robot that combines with the four Gran Divas to form the Gravion.\n\nTouga has one of the highest G-Factors among the Earthgertz, thus is capable of withstanding the pressures of piloting the Gran Kaiser. It is Sandman's wish that Touga's interaction with Eiji Shigure will help him develop his human side, and though Toga learns more of the environment outside the castle, his views are simplistic and childish in nature, such as putting victory over the Zeravire first above conserving human life, something which Eiji does not approve Touga of.\n\nOriginally an orphan, Touga was raised at an orphanage sponsored by Sandman. Frequently bullied by some of the other children, another orphan was there to help him through his time at the orphanage, until Sandman adopted him and took him to Saint-Germain Castle. \n\nOne of the many maids working in Klein Sandman's castle, Eina treats all members of Earthgertz and the other maids well. Easily frightened, Eina finds simple arguments harsh and battles against the Zeravire to be unbearable, but does her best in her piloting duties as the second driver of the G-Driller. She has cared and looked after Touga Tenkuuji since his arrival into Klein Sandman's Saint-Germain Castle. In \"Gravion Zwei\", she pilots the Geo Javelin alongside Luna Gusuku.\n\nIn \"Gravion Zwei\", Eina reveals herself as one of Sandman's \"Proto Gran Divas\". It took Sandman nearly 50 years to create her current, artificial body. After she is destroyed following a Zeravire attack, her memories are immediately transferred to her original body, located inside the Sol Σ Gravion, stored on the moon. \n\nThe only female adult member of Earthgertz, the busty Mizuki Tachibana (ミヅキ・立花, \"Tachibana Mizuki\") is the pilot of the Gran Diva, the \"G-Striker\", who loves her alcohol, but is also the most rational member among her teammates. A skilled hacker, she looks up to Ayaka Shigure when she first arrived at Klein Sandman's castle and claims Ayaka as her best friend, though is still in question at her sudden disappearance. In \"Gravion Zwei\", she pilots the \"Geo Stinger\".\n\nHer name is actually an alias; in \"Gravion Zwei\", she reveals herself as a sleeper agent, working for the EFA intelligence division. Her rank in the EFA is lieutenant. Upon stealing development data on the Gravion, she returns to her superiors, in order to provide them the means to counter the Zeravire threat. For her services, she is given a lush, island estate, but returns to the Earthgertz shortly, citing boredom as her primary reason. Her birthday is revealed to be October 12. Faye Xin Lu refers to her as \"Big Sister\" in Episode 6 of the second season. \n\nA shy girl who lives isolated within the castle's south tower, Leele claims her parents died in a fire years ago. She has no memories following the accident, which has left her traumatized and the sight of raging blue flames easily puts Leele into an extremely frightened state. Raised by Klein Sandman, she secludes herself from others, but opens up to her fellow Earthgertz teammates when they realize she is the pilot of the \"G-Shadow\" Gran Diva. Leele is occasionally seen with her pet ferret \"Lolotte\". In \"Gravion Zwei\", she pilots the \"Geo Caliber\".\n\nLeele's full name is \"Leele Zeravire\", the daughter of \"Zieg Zeravire\" and \"Lufira Zeravire\". Before her home planet of \"Llambias\" was destroyed, thus the origin of her lost memories, she was placed in a stasis capsule and sent by her uncle \"Hugi Zeraire\" into space, following the signal of her father's vessel. Her escape ship failed to enter warp travel, thus arrived on Earth at a later time, yet her own subjective time was different, thus she only aged a few months. Sandman finds her and takes her into Saint-Germain Castle. \n\nAn enigmatic, masked man who works for Klein Sandman, Raven is completely loyal to his master, never sharing any personal information about himself. Raven oversees the Earthgertz's training, combat simulations and attack situations against the Zeravire, and occasionally answers to the EFA about Sandman's involvement in the extraterrestrials' invasion, in place of Sandman himself.\n\nIn \"Gravion Zwei\", it is revealed the current Raven is actually Ayaka Shigure, Eiji Shigure's sister. The mask holds the memories of the original Raven, a former colleague of \"Zieg Zeravire\" on his homeworld of \"Llambias\". The previous holder of Raven's mask was Luna Gusuku's father Isana, before he passed it down to Ayaka.\n\nAyaka in disguise as Raven often acts overcorrect and strict which leads to many gags in the scenes where Raven appears, so despite Raven's serious attitude 'his' role often comes along with a comical purpose which displeases Raven each time. Another running gag involving Raven is that 'he' secretly desires to get a day off and acts jealously when their teammates are on mission which appear to be more like fooling around like it was their day off such as when the Earthgartz group goes to an amusement park in the third episode of the second season.\n\nAs Raven: <br> \nAs Ayaka Shigure: \n\nThe handsome, billionaire businessman and commander of the Earthgertz, Klein Sandman's knowledge of science and technology allows him to build the Gran Divas and the Gran Kaiser to battle the Zeravire. Sandman selects people with a high tolerance on the effects of gravity, a genetically inherited trait he calls the \"G-Factor\", to become the pilots of his machines. When it seems the Zeravire are too much to handle for Earthgertz, Sandman approves of combining the Gran Divas and the Gran Kaiser into Gravion. In \"Gravion Zwei\", he pilots the Gran Sigma.\n\nSandman was originally \"Zieg Zeravire\", a scientist from the ecologically devastated planet of \"Llambias\" and the husband to \"Lufira Zeravire\". In order to stop further contamination and to prevent an all-out war between the neighboring world of \"Selias\", due to Llambians forcing themselves to immigrate there, Sandman creates the Genesis Machine \"Gran Sigma\", the prototype to the Gran Kaiser, in hopes of restoring Llambias' environment. Unfortunately, his brother-in-law \"Hugi Zeravire\" creates the \"Genocidron System\", an automatic, robotic network programmed for extermination. He intended to use it on the Selians, as a means to spare enough Llambians if war was to occur, but Sandman did not wish to see lives sacrificed. Following a brief struggle with Hugi, he accidentally destroys the control device to the Genocidron System, making the machines indiscriminately destroying \"both\" worlds.\n\nUpon escaping Llambias, Sandman and Raven flee to Earth. In order to conceal his identity, he takes the name and appearance of the actual \"Klein Sandman\", an 18th-century aristocrat. To provide himself the means to prepare for the Zeravire, Sandman genetically suppresses his own G-Factor, giving him immortality and turning his hair purple from its original blond. Some time before Eiji's arrival at Saint-Germain Castle, a spacecraft lands on Earth that followed his escaping vessel, carrying his daughter, \"Leele Zeravire\". Sandman never knew of her survival until then.\n\nKlein Sandman makes an appearance in \"Juusou Kikou Dancouga Nova\", which is also directed by Masami Obari. \n\nAppearing in \"Gravion Zwei\", Faye Xin Lu is captain of the \"G-Soldiers\" squadron in the EFA military. Very serious and committed to her line of duty, she was an orphan at the same orphanage sponsored by Sandman, meeting Toga Tenkuji for the first time, protecting him from frequent bullies. In fact, Faye was initially selected to be trained as the pilot of the Gran Kaiser, for she had a similar, if not, higher G-Factor than Toga, but Sandman made a last-minute decision and selected him, instead. This last-minute switch leaves Faye feeling embittered towards both Toga and Sandman, causing her to attempt to surpass Toga and even at one point take advantage of his fragile mental state. However, upon being saved by Sol Gravion, she reconsiders and dismisses her grudge. She pilots Grantrooper Unit 1, armed with the \"Graviton Rang\" weapon based on God Gravion's Graviton Crescent. It can also draw energy from the other four units for its \"Graviton Lightning Detonator\", based on the Graviton Arc. She refers to Mizuki as \"Big Sister\". \n\nGonzo has released three volumes, both on DVD and VHS. Studio Half Eye released a special \"Ultimate Gravion Toy\" for the Saishou Henkei line for promoting the series in Japan, while Yamato released GNU-DOU God Gravion and GN-U Gran Kaiser figures in December 2008.\n\nThe individual Japanese DVD releases for the first series also had special limited editions. Each volume came with a figure of the respective front cover's character for that DVD for a total of six figures (covering each of the main Gravion pilots in their pilot suits). In addition each figure also had some parts for the God Gravion which could be completed if all the six limited edition DVDs with their corresponding figures were bought by the consumer.\n\nBoth \"Gravion\" and \"Gravion Zwei\" are included as entries in \"Super Robot Wars Z\" from the series of video games called \"Super Robot Wars\" for the PlayStation 2. \"Gravion Zwei\" is also included in the latest two-part game, \"The 2nd Super Robot Wars Z\" for the PlayStation Portable, making an appearance in both Hakai-Hen (Break the World Chapter) and Saisei-Hen (Rebirth Chapter).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2022048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022048", "title": "Ayya Vaikundar", "text": "Ayya Vaikundar\n\nLord Ayya Vaikundar (c.1833–c.1851; ), known to his followers as tenth avatar or incarnation of Lord Vishnu, also called as Sriman Narayana Vaikundaswamy or Narayana Pandaram, was a 19th-century social reformer and iconoclast who worked for the upliftment of downtrodden people in the Kingdom of Travancore. He is central to the Hindu denomination of Ayyavazhi, as per holy scripture.\n\nAkilathirattu says, whenever the yuga ages and major injustice happens, God appears as incarnations to establish dharma by destroying adharma.\n\nAt the beginning of Universe, devas gathered in Kailasa and had Amrutham. After having, devas asked Lord Shiva, do we have any enemies. To answer this, Lord Siva lits an agni kunda and went himself into it and sang vedakandam with dance. After completion when he returned from agni kunda, a deadly monster called Kroni (Asura or evil force) was also born inside an agni kunda. After few days, the evil force kroni was trying to destroy Kailasa in order to kill devas. To save devas, Lord Narayana took a penance to get grace of Lord Shiva to destroy Kroni. Lord Shiva appeared and said to Narayana, \"Kroni should be cut in six pieces”. In doing so, every piece of him will be born as a monster on the earth, and you will have to incarnate to destroy the other demons.\n\nLord Narayana consents and chops Kroni into six pieces in Neetiya yuga. Accordingly, Lord Narayana incarnated by the Yuga-Yugas in order to protect the Dharma. So, he appeared in the Chathur Yuga and the Netu Yuga by destroying the asuras such as Gundomasali, Thillai Mallalan, and Mallossy Vaughan that emerged from Kroni's chunk. Later in the Kretha Yuga, Lord incarnated as Muruga, Narasimha and Sri Rama in the Thretha Yuga to destroy the Asuras such as Singamukha Suran, Surapathman, Iranian, and Ravana. In the Dwapara Yuga Lord incarnated as Sri Krishna to destroy the Asuras such as Duryodhana, Takkan and helped the Pandavas to establish the Dharma by establishing the Pandavas Kingdom again. Kroni was refused to listen Lord Narayana’s council, whenever he was born and destroyed. Lord narayana was angry on this and last said to kroni \"You will die because of yourself”. Then, at the end of Dwapara yuga, Lord was known that Kailyan will come, that is the reason he had led the route of forest, while on the way he had taken back the powers of pandavas and left his body on top of the hill and left this world.\n\nWhenever Lord Narayana incarnates, he gives the details in scriptures about his incarnation. The Akilattirattu is the divine scripture, which gives the details of tenth incarnation of Lord Narayana in form of Vaikundar.\n\nYes, to understand Rama Avatara, Ramayana was provided to the world. For Krishna Avatara, Mahabharatha was written. To know about Vaikunta Avatara, Akilathirattu was provided to mankind. Vedas, puranas, Itihasas, and also according to the predictions in other religions, to end the cruelties of Kali Yuga and to protect the world, Narayana appeared as Vaikuntar.\n\nAyyavazhi scripture Akilattirattu gives the world's historical and mythological events. It also gives prophecy of the avatars of Lord Narayana and his coming along with extensive quantity of historical facts. This holy book focus on the “supreme oneness” and narrates the events starting from the creation of the Universe. It also explains us what has happened so far and what is going to happen next. This holy book was compiled by his fifth citar - Hari Gopalan on Kollam Year 1016 at 27th day of Tamil Month Karthikai (10 December 1841 CE, Friday). Hari Goplan received holy Apostle from Lord in his dream, which commissioned him to write the Akilattirattu by giving him the first syllable - “The Kappu”.\n\nAyyavazhi followers believe that Lord Vishnu itself incarnated as Lord Ayya Vaikundar during an encounter with a deity Goddess Lakshmi.\n\nAs per Akilathirattu, by the words of the devas, the Lord Shiva gave birth to the Kaliyan (Asura), that emerged from last and sixth piece of Kroni's chunk. The Kali yuga begun, when the Kaliyan was born. Kroni’s fifth chunk Duryodhana in the previous yuga was transmigrated as Kaliyan in Kali yuga. After his birth, he got lots of boon from Lord Shiva, which had more powers compared to the powers of the Asura of previous yuga’s. His Powers included reign of the King, various tricks, long life tricks and the Lord’s Chakrayuta. When Kaliyan was on the way to earth, Lord Narayana in the form of Pantaram (Monk) stopped him and challenged him for fight. Kaliyan ignored by saying, “I have lot of powers, If I fight with you, my wife will laugh!”. In response, Lord Narayana asked him to promise - \"Going forward he won't fight or disrupt any Pantaram”. Kaliyan agreed and gave the promise – “I will never fight or disrupt any Pantaram, If I will do so, will lose everything and will go to hell\". Akilathirattu says, this is the reason behind Lord Narayana’s tenth avatar in Kali yuga as Narayana Pantaram.\n\nIt is said that this Kaliyan became the king of earth in various places and tortured the lives of the good people. He created various caste system in order to divide and rule. Collected heavy taxes from public, That is to say, from feather to Mangalasutra, he put heavy taxes and tortured the people lives. Due to this, Lord Narayana got angry and advised Kaliyan to stop torturing the people who are innocent by mind and heart. However, he did not agree and preferred death rather than giving up. As per the vedas of sage Vyasa, In order to stop the rule of Kaliyan and to bring an end to this Kali yuga, Lord Narayana planned to make Vaikundar incarnate as Pantaram.\n\nWhen the day came, In Kali yuga, the Lord Narayana himself incarnated as Vaikundar during an encounter with a deity Goddess Lakshmi, he was beget inside the sea and arose from the sea of Tiruchendur on Kollam Year 1008 at 20th day of Tamil Month Masi (1st March 1833 CE, Friday). He took the human form as Pantaram at Tharuvaiyur near seashore, this is considered a unique avatar in ayyavazhi mythology. Then he started walking towards Detchanam. This place became a holy place for the devotees of Ayyavazhi and they erected a temple there named Avatharappathi. This event is celebrated during the festival of Ayya Vaikundar Avataram. From the point of incarnation of Vaikundar, it is said that he will destroy Kaliyan and the evil in Kali Yuga. It is also said that he will take all righteous people along with him in the succeeding eighth yuga called as Dharma yuga.\n\nLord Ayya Vaikundar, who arose from the sea at Thiruchendur \"(per Akilathirattu Ammanai)\" on 20th of the Tamil Month of Masi (1_March_1833 CE, Friday) is considered a unique avatar by the followers of Ayyavazhi. Akilam, speaks about it in great detail, as summarized below:\n\nI (Hari Gopalan) am writing these words of Akilathirattu Ammanai with the grace of God!\n\n“ ‘O’ Lord you took avatar for Pandavas and eliminated their enemies.\n\n    You attained the abode of Kailasa with anger due to birth of Kaliyan.\n\n     Came again to the world to protect santror (good people) and dharma”\n\n“On Masi 1008, I (Lord Narayana) myself appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea, have taken residence in Theksanapuri as Vaikundar” – Akilathirattu\n\nAkilathirattu says, Lord Narayana himself incarnated as Vaikundar and appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea. This place became a holy place for the devotees of Ayya vazhi and they erected a temple there named Avathara pathi.\n\nGod says this prophecy,\n\n\"I (Lord Narayana) took the avatar for yuga trail and became the praise child for Sita.\n\nAs a king of Dharma yuga, I am going to rule the world with single command\" – Akilathirattu\n\nIn each of the five yugas prior to the avatar of Lord Ayya Vaikundar, as each fragment of Kroni (evil or Devil) came into physical form, the Lord Vishnu incarnated as well, destroying them. However, in this the sixth yuga, the evil was called Kali (कलि) (n\"ot the Hindu deity\"), and having no physical form (see Pre-Incarnational Events for this account) he occupied the mind of people of earth as the Mayai (illusion), causing them to behave discourteously. Kaliyan claimed, it was impossible to destroy him by the use of weapons in this yuga as in the previous ones as he held the from Supreme god Shiva, that is the reason Lord Narayan, to incarnate as \"pandaram\" in the world to destroy him.\n\nIn the name of Vaikundar, Lord came towards Swamithopu as Pantaram. Lord Vaikundar as a Pantaram, had donned himself in squalid rags, smeared the white mark on forehead, tied a turban on his head and carried a cane. Upon reaching Swamithopu, he undertook a penance for 6 years to get grace and power of Lord Shiva. He got the power to abolish the rule of the evil force Kaliyan from the world and for the subsequent end of Kali yuga. Lord did many mighty miracles. These include, curing all the diseases for those people who came to get blessing from him. He baught eighteen-caste people together for peace and equality. Lord Vaikundar had five disciples (Citars). According to Akilathirattu, the Pandavas of previous Dwapara yuga were made to take birth in this Kali yuga as Citars of Vaikundar. The holy book Akilathirattu was compiled by his fifth citar - Hari Gopalan alias Sahadeva.\n\nAccording to Akilam, Vaikundar is 10th avatar of Lord Narayana, also popularly called as “Narayana Pantaram” or “Kalki” alias “Ayya”. Lord's avatar happens to be next to his Krishna avatar. In this avatar, Lord Narayana incarnated as “Trimurti” alias “Siva Narayana”. He had supreme power for the responsibility to destroy the evil of Kali (कलि).\n\nAnother view is that Lord Vishnu did not take a human body and showed only a bodily appearance to mankind based upon quotes in Akilam.\n\nUpon reaching Poovantanthoppe, (present-day Swamithope), he undertook a penance. The penance consisted of three stages, each spanning two years. A tradition describes his postures during the six-year tavam as follows: during the first two years, he stood inside a six feet deep pit; during the next two years, he squatted on the ground; and during the last two years, he sat on a raised platform. His appearance was squalid, \"long and entangled plait of hair\" and frayed clothes. He spoke less and subsisted on frugal meals.\n\nAkilathirattu speaks of his incineration of evil spirits as an important event in Lord Ayya Vaikundar's incarnation. It took place when he was performing his penance, which he had announced to be the means of destroying the kalimayai - the illusory evil force. He gathered the people and caused some of them, both male and female, to be possessed of the evil spirits (peyattam). The possessed ones danced in front of the crowd as if the evil spirits had come upon them. Vaikundar, then, ordered these evil spirits to make an oath, in front of the people, to surrender their powers and incinerate themselves. When he had finished his orders, the dancers fell flat on the ground and burned.\n\nSimilarly, Vaikundar performed another action to 'seize the esoteric evil powers'. Akilathirattu says that he took away the powers of those who knew to perform witchcraft, sorcery and other magical rituals. People living in the hills, called as Kanikkarar, were believed to be powerful shamans, having powers to contain or to provoke the demons. Vaikundar, in a trance, made some of them testify that they had surrendered their powers. People grew appreciative of Ayya's actions. They began addressing him as Vaikuntasami. This implied an attribution of divinity to Vaikundar. Vaikundar exhorted the people as follows:\nThere are no demons, no devils.\" No ill effects of magical practices,\nNo disease, no pain and no extortion of taxes,\nAnd, therefore, live courageously.\"\nLord Vaikundar has five disciples (citars). According to holy scripture Akilathirattu Ammanai the Pandavas of previous Dwapara Yukam was made to take birth in this Kali Yukam as Citars of Vaikundar. They are Dharma Citar, Bhima Citar, Arjunan Citar, Nakulan Citar and Sakatevan Citar.\n\nThe fame of Vaikundar began to spread in the countries of Travancore and Tirunelveli and he was gradually recognised as a religious person with extraordinary powers. He was addressed as a Pantaram, a religious person hailing from and serving the ordinary folk. Akilathirattu addresses him as Narayana Pantaram.\n\nPeople came to listen to his teachings and instructions, to be cured by him of different diseases, to witness, worship and serve a religious person. Vaikundar encouraged the people to come together around a well to take a ritual bath, irrespective of caste. He encouraged them to dine together in his presence.He stressed that he had come to abolish Kali Yukam and to usher in an age of Dharma Yukam, when the now-oppressed and suffering people would be liberated and rule the land under his leadership. 'Uplift of the lowly is dharmam’ was a constant refrain in his teachings. People were encouraged to serve as catalysts for the destruction of Kali by transforming themselves to be 'people of Dharma Yukam' and to acquire a new character. The new character would come upon them, he said, if they learned to live with self-respect, social dignity and fearlessness. Underscoring the importance of self-respect and social dignity, he said, ‘if one lives with dignity and self-respect, the kali would destroy itself’ . He said when people grew out of kalimayai, Dharma Yukam would unfold and in that age, he would rule over the people as Dharma Raja, the king of Dharma Yukam.\n\nAccording to the legend as per holy akilam, when Kaliyan was born, he got the boon from Supreme god Shiva, which has more powers than compare to which he got on previous yuga's. When he was on the way to earth, Lord Narayana was in the form of Pantaram stopped him and asked him to fight with. When Kaliyan was ignored, Lord Narayana asked him to promise, \"going forward i won't fight or distrupt any Pantaram. If i will do so, will lose everything and will go to hell\".\n\nThat is the reason Lord Narayana has taken his tenth avatar on this kali yuga as Narayana Pantaram. \n\nHe made some controversial statements like mentioning the travancore king as ‘Devil in Ananthapuri’ and the British rule as ‘Rule of White Devils’. Against the background of the growing popularity of Vaikundar and the convergence of people around him in multitudes, a complaint was lodged against him with the king of Travancore. The Travancore king Swathi thirunal arrested Vaikundar in 1838 and imprisoned him at Singarathoppu jail in Travancore. After 110 days of imprisonment, on March 26, 1839 he was released by Swathithirunal on the advise of Thycaud Ayya who was the Guru of Swathi thirunal Maharaj and a disciple of Vaikundar as well.\n\nAfter returning from the prison, Vaikundar inspired a group of his devotees to undertake a religious exercise called Thuvayal Thavasu. He also performed miracles. He married Saptha Kanniyar as Narayanar (see: Marriage with the Seven Virgins), the Seven deities in the form of Ekam (see:Marriage with the Deities). He initiated festivities (see: Festivals and Celebrations).\" The deities were made to 'come upon' some of the female devotees who became their human media and a marriage ceremony was performed. Ceremonial processions were held amidst singing, incantations and shouts of joy by the followers. Several rites and rituals were instituted during these occasions.\n\nLater Lord Vaikundar was invited by his devotees to their homes and treated in a grand manner. By way of soliciting his blessings, his devotees carried him to different places. During these occasions, he laid foundations in various places for small shrine-like centres, called Nizhal Thangals. Lord Vaikundar came to recognize five individuals as his closest disciples. Through one of his disciples, Hari Gopalan Citar, he wrote the holy book, called \"Akilam\".\n\nLord Vaikundar returned to Vaikundam on 3 June 1851. According to Ayyavazhi followers, he has returned to Vaikundam. However, this date is disputed, as Samuel Mateer mentions the year as 1848. As he returned to Vaikundam, his body was interned in a tomb and, around that, a pati (temple) was later built. His devotees continued to visit this site and performed the rituals as they used to do when Vaikundar was bodily present. His life and works remain the foundation of the Ayyavazhi. The head temple of the Ayyavazhi religion is the Swamithoppepathi and is located in the Village of Swamithope.\n\nThe film \"Ayyavazhi\" released in 2008 was based on the life of Lord Vaikundar.

The libretto was written in German by , and translated into Czech by Ervin Špindler. It was first performed at the New Town Theatre in Prague on 16 May 1868. The opera received criticism at the time for being overly influenced by German opera, including that of Richard Wagner's \"Lohengrin\".\n\nThe subject of the opera is (fl. c. 1490), a Czech knight who took part in an uprising in Ploskovice in support of the oppressed people and was sentenced to death in 1498, during the reign of Vladislaus II of Hungary. The plot bears a resemblance to that of Ludwig van Beethoven's opera \"Fidelio\", in that the central female characters in each opera disguise themselves in male clothing to try to save the hero.\n\nSmetana had great affection for the opera, but because of the lukewarm reception, died thinking that he had failed with this opera. The revival in 1886, however, two years after the composer's death, was a success. In the 1890s, the opera received productions in Zagreb, Munich, and Hamburg. Gustav Mahler conducted an 1892 production in Vienna.\n\nDalibor, a Czech Knight is on trial before the king for having murdered the burgrave of Ploskovice in revenge for execution of his friend, the musician Zdeněk. At the trial, the king calls upon the burgrave's sister, Milada, who demands his execution. As Dalibor is brought in, the crowd rises in support of him. When Dalibor tells of his friend's capture and murder the court reduces his sentence from death to lifetime imprisonment. Milada painfully realized that she is falling in love with Dalibor, and in collusion with Jitka, an orphan befriended by the knight, she resolves to set him free.\n\nAfter a scene in a mercenary camp, where Jitka and her lover Vítek plot to free Dalibor, Milada enters the prison disguised as a boy and finds employment with Dalibor's jailer, Beneš. She charms the jailer into allowing her into dungeon where Dalibor is being held, to give him his friend's violin. The knight is dreaming, and initially thinks Milada is a reincarnation of his beloved Zdeněk. Then in a passionate duet, they sing of their joy in having found each other.\n\nIn the dungeon, Dalibor looks forward to escape (singing his famous Song to Freedom) but feeling it is a bad omen when one of the strings of Zdeněk's violin breaks. The plot to bribe Beneš fails, and the jailer informs the king of their attempted escape. Taking the advice of his council, the king orders Dalibor's death. Milada, waiting outside the prison, hears the tolling of the bell that signals Dalibor's execution. Accompanied by her followers, she storms the castle, where, after rescuing Dalibor, she is wounded and dies in his arms. Dalibor stabs himself and is united in death with his beloved. An alternative ending has Dalibor executed before Milada can rescue him.\n\nIn Czech\n\nIn German\n\nIn English\n\nIn Italian\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

Axial chirality is most commonly observed in atropisomeric substituted biaryl compounds wherein the rotation about the aryl–aryl bond is restricted, for example, various biphenyls, binaphthyls such as BINAP, and certain dihydroanthracenone compounds. Certain allene compounds and spirans also display axial chirality. The enantiomers of axially chiral compounds are usually given the stereochemical labels \"R\" and \"S\". The designations are based on the same Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules used for tetrahedral stereocenters. The chiral axis is viewed end-on and the two \"near\" and two \"far\" substituents on the axial unit are ranked, but with the additional rule that the two near substituents have higher priority than the far ones.\n\nThis property can also be called helicity, since the axis of the structure has a helical, propeller, or screw-shaped geometry. \"P\" (plus) or Δ is a right-handed helix, where \"M\" (minus) or Λ is a left-handed helix. The \"P\"/\"M\" or Δ/Λ terminology is used particularly for molecules that actually resemble a helix, such as [6]helicene. It can also be applied to other structures having axial chirality by considering the helical orientation of the \"front\" vs \"back\" Cahn–Ingold–Prelog rankings.\n\n"}

It is cited as an independent monistic religion by several newspapers, government reports, journals, and academic researchers. In Indian censuses, however, the majority of its followers declare themselves as Hindus. Thus, Ayyavazhi is also considered a Hindu denomination. Officially (legally), it exists within Hinduism as a Hindu denomination.\n\nAyyavazhi is centered on the life and preachings of Ayya Vaikundar; its ideas and philosophy are based on the holy texts \"Akilathirattu Ammanai\" and \"Arul Nool\". Accordingly, Vaikundar was the Purna avatar of Narayana. Ayyavazhi shares many ideas with Hinduism in its beliefs and practice, but differs considerably in its concepts of good and evil and dharma. Ayyavazhi is classified as a dharmic belief because of its central focus on dharma.\n\nAyyavazhi first came to public attention in the 19th century as a Hindu sect. Vaikundar's activities and the growing number of followers caused a reformation and revolution in 19th century Travancorean and Tamil society, surprising the feudal social system of South India. It also triggered a number of reform movements including those of Narayana Guru and Ramalinga Swamigal.\n\nThough Ayyavazhi followers are spread across India, they are primarily present in South India, especially concentrated in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The number of practitioners is estimated to be between 8,000,000 and 10,000,000 although the exact number is unknown, since Ayyavazhis are reported as Hindus during censuses.\n\n\"Ayya\" in Tamil means 'Master' and \"vazhi\", 'way'; the simple translation is \"Master's way\" or 'Father's way' Due to the diverse synonymous versions for the phrase in Tamil, it also leads to various other theories.\n\nAyyavazhi began to be noticed initially by the large number of people gathering to worship Vaikundar (known historically as \"Mudisoodum Perumal\") (c. 1809 – c. 1851 CE) at Poovandanthoppe. The Thuvayal thavasu (washing penance) of 1840 is the origin of Ayyavazhi as an alternative religio-cultural phenomena. The majority of its participants were from marginalised and poor sections of society. They began to function as a distinct and autonomous society, and gradually, they identified their path with the phrase 'Ayya vazhi'. Although the majority of these followers were from the Nadar caste, a large number of people from other castes also follow it. Ayyavazhi's rapid growth throughout its first century of existence was noted by Christian missionary reports from the mid-19th century.\n\nBy the middle of 19th century, Ayyavazhi had come to be a recognisable religious phenomenon with deep roots in the regions of South Travancore and South Tirunelveli. The numbers of faithful increased significantly from the 1840s. By the close of the 19th century, Swamithope was considered the religio-cultural epi-center of Ayyavazhi. After the time of Vaikundar, Ayyavazhi was spread through his teachings. The five Seedars, disciples of Vaikundar and their descendants, traveled to several parts of the country bearing the mission of Ayyavazhi. Meanwhile, the Payyan dynasty started administrating the Swamithoppe pathi, while other Pathis came under the administration of the followers of Ayya. Following the instructions of Akilattirattu Ammanai (Akilam), the Nizhal Thangals (small pagodas) have been established across the country for worship and the study of scripture.\n\nArul Nool, the first Ayyavazhi work in print was released in 1927, followed by the Akilam in 1933, almost a century after it had been written down. As a result, Ayyavazhi abandoned active oral traditions in favor of literary scriptures. Ayyavazhi headquarter reports that Ayyavazhi spread more rapidly after Indian Independence (1940s) and still more rapidly through the 1990s. Many Ayyavazhi-based social welfare organisations were established in the late 20th century. Several alternative versions of Akilam, including some controversial versions, were released during the same period. The Anbukkodimakkal Thirucchabai, a democratic bureau, was established by the religious headquarters in the early 1990s to organize and govern the religion. Organisational conferences are held in various cities in South India including Mumbai, Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nConsidering the growth of Ayyavazhi, Ayya Vaikunda Avataram, the day of Vaikundar's incarnation, was declared a holiday by the state administration for the district of Kanyakumari in 1994, followed by the districts of Tirunelveli and Tuticorin in 2006. From 2012 C.E Vaikunda Avataram was declared a restricted holiday for the entire Tamil Nadu state. and for the Kerala State from 2015. Currently, Bala Prajapathi Adikalar, heir to the Payyan dynasty, is considered the leader of Ayyavazhi.\n\nThe holy books of Ayyavazhi are the Akilattirattu Ammanai (commonly referred to as \"<nowiki>Akilam</nowiki>\") and the Arul Nool, and they are the source of the religion's mythology. The \"Akilattirattu Ammanai\" was written by Hari Gopalan Seedar in 1841, as if hearing the contents of Akilam told by Narayana to his consort Lakshmi. In addition to the mythological events Akilam also provides an extensive quantity of historical facts, especially that of mid and late 2nd millennium CE. While the original text is damaged, the daughter versions such as the \"Swamithope\" version, the \"Kottangadu\" version as well as the \"Panchalankurichi\" versions, are the earliest existing palm-leaf versions of Akilam. Other released versions includes the Sentrathisai Ventraperumal, the Vivekanandan, the highly criticised VTV and the earliest and commonly accepted Palaramachandran version. Akilam contains more than 15,000 verses in seventeen sections. It is written in poetic Tamil in a ballad form, and is composed with a unique literal-style with two subgenres, \"Viruttam\" and \"Natai\" throughout.\n\nThe secondary scripture, Arul Nool, includes various books that are believed to be written by Arulalarkal (one possessed by divine power). It contains prayers, hymns and instructions for the way of worship in Ayyavazhi, as well as rituals prophesy and many acts. It also contains many events found in the Akilam pertaining to the life of Vaikundar. Unlike Akilam, there is no definitive history for Arul Nool. All these texts are compiled in Tamil language.\n\nTo the Ayyavazhi devotees, there are seven holy places, called Pathis, with the Pancha pathis being the most important. The temple of the Swamithope pathi is the headquarters of the Ayyavazhi.\n\nThe five Pancha pathi are:\n1. the Swamithope Pathi, the venue of the great Tavam and the religion's headquarters.\n2. Ambala Pathi, where Vaikundar joined six of the Seven Deities unto himself.\n3. Mutta Pathi, the venue of the Second and Third Vinchais.\n4. Thamaraikulam Pathi, where the Akilattirattu Ammanai was written down.\n5. Poo Pathi, where Ayya unified the Earth goddess Poomadanthai to himself by symbolic marriage.\n\nVakaippathi, though not included in the Pancha pathis by the headquarters, is still considered as a Pathi but with lesser importance. There is disagreement among followers of Ayyavazhi regarding the holiness of some other Pathis, such as Vaikunda Pathi and Avathara Pathi. The list of Pathis announced by the headquarters of Ayyavazhi does not include these Pathis.\nThe symbol of Ayyavazhi is a lotus carrying a flame-shaped white \"Namam\". The lotus represents the 1,008-petalled \"Sahasrara\" (in Tamil, \"Ladam\"), while the Namam represents the \"Aanma Jyothi\" or \"atman\". Both of the Ayyavazhi scriptures refer to Thirunamam (the \"flame shaped symbol\" present in the top of the Lotus in the Ayyavazhi symbol), but not to the lotus directly. The symbol is the ideological summary of Akilam-based philosophy. This symbol has been in use since the mid-20th century.\n\nThe mythical narration in akilam about the eight yugas is often viewed philosophically as a reference to eight chakras. The first, Neetiya Yukam, is Bindu and the final state, Dharma Yukam, is Sahasrara, or absolute bliss. In this series, the energy of consciousness (\"namam\") of oneself is invoked, rising from Bindu (Neetiya Yukam) to the final Sahasrara (Dharma Yukam). This lotus, the highest spiritual center of enlightenment, is for experiencing the absolute \"bliss\". The reigning power in the final Dharma Yukam (Sahasrara) is Ekam, which is a part of Vaikundar a Trinity conception, or a manifestation of the supreme absolute.\n\nThus Ayyavazhi's symbol is derived from Akilam. The symbol \"Lotus with Thirunamam\" shows \"Vaikundar's experienced in Sahasrara.\"\n\nIn certain Hindu texts, the Sahasrara chakra has 1000 petals. But in Ayyavazhi symbolism, Saharara has 1008 petals. In Ayyavazhi, there is no scriptural authority indicating the importance of 1000, but the number 1008 is commonly mentioned. Also, the incarnation year of Vaikundar is 1008 M.E. (Malayalam Era). \"Sahasrara\" is symbolised as a lotus without a stem.\n\nAyyavazhi architecture was developed in constructing Nizhal Thangals, where the inverted lotus flower of \"Sahasrara\" is used to cover the roof. The lotus may also represent the heart and the flame shape (Thirunamam), the divinity.\nAyyavazhi has used other symbols including Vaishnavite ' \"Triple Namam\" '(not used currently), and Conch.\n\nThe majority of Ayyavazhi's key teachings can be found in the book \"Akilattirattu Ammanai\" and other teachings are collated from various books written by unknown authors, whose works feature in the Arul Nool. Like Dharma, the other teachings of Ayyavazhi are twofold, sociological and mystical. The mystical teachings are devoted to revealing divine knowledge, while social teachings are primarily concerned with eliminating inequality and discrimination in society. The teachings encourage a positive relationship with God, as opposed to one based on fear. Followers are encouraged to refer to God as \"Ayya\", \"father\", to strengthen their intimacy and affection towards God.\nAyyavazhi mystics focus on supreme oneness. Among its variations, the theology always maintains this focus on oneness. The evil of Kali blocks the ultimate oneness prevailing between individual souls and the universe, creating among them a false sense of individuality and of extreme pride. This erroneous view causes the apparent sense of separation from the oneness and motivates against it. Ekam —the \"over-soul\" or the supreme soul—is identified as the whole of existence, changeless in nature and ubiquity. This is \"one which undergoes different changes with respect to space and time\" because of the evil force maya. \n\nAll of creation evolved from this Ekam, the supreme consciousness. All the qualities of Ekam are within each soul, and evolve from it. Each and every individual soul is a reflection or mirror of the absolute Supreme, which provides the textual basis and metaphor for the mirror's role in Ayyavazhi worship. Human and all other souls are restricted and limited by the evil of Kali. This is why individual souls are not able to attain supreme bliss, and so are secondary to Ekam. Once a soul overcomes the influence of maya, it becomes one with Ekam. Its individuality is gone, and thereby it is Ekam. On the other hand, this supreme consciousness is personified as Paramatma (oversoul) by which, God is the \"Husband\", while all other souls are his \"consorts\", symbolised by Thirukkalyana Ekanai, where Vaikundar marries the individual souls. Also, the Ayyavazhi philosophy applies a common formula for the creation of human beings and the rest of the universe. Thus whatever exists externally to human beings exists also internally.Ayyavazhi explicitly condemns the caste based inequalities in its social teachings. It denounces the caste discrimination rather than the 'caste system' itself.\nFrom its inception, Ayyavazhi has doubly served as an engine of social reform, particularly in the area of Travancore, which was previously noted for its strong caste system. In this context, the mingling of castes in Ayyavazhi centers was a vital element in the transformation of society.\nAyya Vaikundar was the first to succeed as a social reformer in launching political struggle, social renaissance as well as religious reformation in the country. Vaikundar was the pioneer of the social revolutionaries of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Research scholars regard Vaikundar as a teacher, healer and also a miracle worker. He was also said to be the forerunner of all social reformers of India. Akilam displayed sympathy for the laboring classes, and opposed to the often excessive taxes they were forced to pay. From the beginning the followers, fortified by the teachings, have also taken a strong stand against political oppression. This is most clearly seen in Akilam, where the Thiruvithkanur king is identified as Kalineesan, (one who is a captive of Kali) and the British are identified as Venneesan (the white neesan) in the social sense. Ayyavazhi was in the forefront of movements for Human Rights and Social Equality. Ayyavazhi also effected many social changes in southern India, resulting in the emergence of a series of social and self-respect movements such as \"Upper cloth agitation\", Temple entry agitation and other movements including those of Narayana Guru, Chattampi Swamikal, Vallalar and Ayyankali.\n\nThe followers of Ayyavazhi established \"Pathis\" and \"Nizhal Thangals\", which are centers of worship and religious learning in various parts of the country. They serve as centres for propagation of the beliefs and practices of Ayyavazhi. There are thousands of \"Nizhal Thangals\" throughout India, mostly in South India. There more than 7000 worship centres in South India mainly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Reports from the London Missionary Society (LMS) of the mid-19th century also speak of \"Nizhal Thangals\". Since Ayyavazhi is not centrally organised, \"Swamithope pathi\" serves as the religious headquarters for all. The \"Pathi\"s earn more importance among the worship centers.\n\nThe seven \"Pathi\"s, obtain their significance from the fact that Vaikundar and his activities were historically associated with these centers of worship. The \"Swamithope pathi\", though considered the religion's headquarters, does not officially control the rest of the religious centers. All \"Pathis\", except itself, are managed by independent committees. The five \"Pathis\" known as Pancha pathi are considered foremost among Pathis.\n\nNizhal Thangals, compared with \"Pathis\", are simple small structures built for worship and for learning the teachings of Vaikundar. They also served as centers of school education during the early days. Food and shelter are offered to the needy in these centres. Some of them were established when Vaikundar was alive. Among them Arul Nool, specifies seven Thangals, and these are considered primary over the others. Today, charity is one of the main activities conducted in these centers.\n\nThese centers emerged as the abode of Dharma. The Nizhal Thangals form an important institution in the socio-religious life of the people of Ayyavazhi. Panividai may be conducted up to three times daily, but all worship centers provide Panividai at least once daily.\n\nThe ethics of Ayyavazhi, integrated with the meta-narrative mythology, are found throughout the primary scripture, \"Akilattirattu Ammanai\". Regarding ethics, Arul Nool is an accumulation of the core concepts found in Akilam. In Akilam, the ethical abstracts are pointed out as \"told by God\" at several places at different situations to lesser devas, saints, etc. whenever asked by them.\n\nNeetham is the primary virtue of Ayyavazhi. This shows how society, its people, the ruling king, etc., lived in absolute harmony with nature, placing the power of Almighty in all their works, deeds and activities during early ages. In return, nature and the divine beings protect the society which follows the Neetham. Chastity and life in ultimate union with nature form the central theme, an ethical form that is to be followed. As in Akilam, Vinchai is the rules and regulations provided by God (Narayana) to Vaikundar. There are three such Vinchais. Acts found there also fit to humans to improve their moral code. The first \"Vinchai of Tiruchendur\" forms the largest ethical accumulation found in Akilam.\n\nTo an extent, the Dharmic teachings in Ayyavazhi are also considered as ethics. Charity in social ethics and \"attempting to realise the ultimate truth of oneness\" in spirituality are the ethical codes under the banner of Ayyavazhi dharma. Akilam also gives separate ethics for Devas also. It is notable that the Ayyavazhi ethics undergo a vast deviation from the incarnation of Vaikundar since a universal change took place then. Over all, as the foremost ethical code, people are advocated to overcome the evil force kalimayai with the weapons of love, forbearance and peace, since Kaliyan as maya rules the minds of people.\n\nArul Nool constitutes the major role in forming the rules and regulations of Ayyavazhi, including ethics. It gives separately the social as well as divine ethics. The Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram here is the section especially dedicated to teach the ethics. The rituals, especially circumambulations, are to be followed to wash-out the sin committed out of immoral thoughts and acts.\n\nIt is difficult to give a clear-cut listing to Ayyavazhi concepts because of the relation the Ayyavazhi scriptures maintains with the Hindu scriptures. Akilam primarily says the central themes of the existing scriptures (that of Hindu) had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar. It also narrates that Akilam was given to mankind as an alternative because Kaliyan destroyed the original Vedas and Shastras, and at the beginning of Kali Yuga, several additions were given to the previous scriptures by him. Both of these view points give the views of Akilam on Hindu scriptures, and place them as reasons for rejecting them.\n\nThe philosophy, terms and mythology of the Ayyavazhi scriptures are the basis of religious study on Ayyavazhi theology. But several terms quoted in Akilam couldn't be understood wholly unless by referring to the descriptive details of those terms in Hindu scriptures. For example, if the 96 tatvas are understood, then the Kaliyan is understood. Therefore, theologians and philosophers today turn to Hindu scriptures to further their understanding of the tatvas as properties of the human body, which are not elaborated upon in Akilam. However, to understand Akilam and its philosophy, one should have a basic knowledge over the Hindu ideas and concepts. Since Akilam have no different view in this matter from Hindu scriptures, it was left to be gathered from there.\n\nOn mythical studies, Akilam covers almost the entire main mythology of Hinduism, including Mahabharata, Ramayana, Kantha Purana and Vishnu Purana, but with limited details. It includes only the main events that are directly linked to the main-stream story flow. But to undergo a detailed study on each, the appropriate Hindu scriptures that include those events in detail need to be referred. Akilam provides all these collectively in brief with an overall story line, which make it unique. Many philosophical concepts from Hinduism are found in Akilam; some of them are completely accepted, some are regenerated, while others are rejected.\n\nGenerally it was considered that once a particular concept is not found well-described in Ayyavazhi scriptures, such as Akilattirattu Ammanai or Arul Nool (as detail as in Hindu scriptures), and instead simply was quoted, then that particular conception is accepted as in Hindu scriptures for religious studies. But once Akilam has different views over something from that of the existing (Hindu) scriptures, then it would be found deeply described in Akilam itself and hence no need for referring other scriptures.\n\nThe theology of Ayyavazhi differs considerably from other monistic religions. It speaks of Ekam, the Oneness from which all that exists formed, and also an ultimate oneness that exists behind all differences. The Ekam, which is articulated as the supreme divine power itself, is supposed to remain unaffected by maya deep inside every changeable matter as an absolute constant. In theological terms, God is, in the highest sense, formless, infinite, genderless and beyond time and space. The term Ekam in Tamil language give simply the meanings, \"one\", \"absolute\", \"the whole which exists\" and \"the incomparable\"; all give some sort of direct monistic definition about God from Ayyavazhi theology.\n\nNarrating through mythology, The \"Sivam\" and the \"Sakthi\" are the first to get evolved from Ekam. The \"Natham\"(voice), Trimurthi, other lesser gods and the entire universe further evolved. The Trimurthi are greater among the personified Devas. Siva, one among the Trimurthi, was the supreme power until Kali Yuga. Vishnu is the supreme from the advent of Kali Yuga. Then, from the incarnation of Vaikundar, again the powers of all god-heads, including that of Vishnu, is transformed to Vaikundar. Ekam, the supreme oneness as one among the Trinity takes a place within Vaikundar for the present age. Therefore, Vaikundar is said to be the only worshippable and supreme power. However, a quote from Akilam thirteen says this supreme oneness (Ekam) itself is created by Vaikundar, who is a personified God. In this regard, Ayyavazhi being centered on Vaikundar, is more monotheistic rather than monistic. No other god-heads, even the Father of Vaikundar, Narayana, have gained an equal or greater status than Vaikundar. Vaikundar is a turine power who includes the qualities of the Santror, Narayana and Ekam within himself.\n\nIn Ayyavazhi mythology, Kroni, a primordial evil manifestation, was fragmented into six and each fragment took birth and plays an anti-Vishnu role throughout the successive six yugas. He was finally destroyed by a final judgment which is followed by the god-ruled Dharma Yukam. This narration gives some dualistic dimension to Ayyavazhi theology. But since the focus of Arul Nool, the accumulation of Ayyavazhi teachings is extremely monistic and since the final fragment of Kroni itself is called \"Kalimayai\" (a conception rather than a physical or material incarnation), it was commonly accepted that the 'Maya' is symbolised in such a way that contrasts the dualistic view on Ayyavazhi. Apart from all these, there are also separate quotes in Ayyavazhi scriptures which give pantheistic and panentheistic definition to Ayyavazhi theology.\n\nThere are two yearly festivals for Ayyavazhi. The Ayya Vaikunda Avataram is celebrated on the twentieth day of the Tamil month \"Masi\" (Feb – March). This is the only Ayyavazhi festival to be celebrated as per the Solar calendar. The mass procession conducted on this day from Nagercoil to Swamithoppe is a popular one in this part of the country. The Thiru Edu-Vasippu is a festival of seventeen days celebrated in the Tamil month of Karthigai (November–December). This celebration of textual reciting as a festival itself is a unique feature to Ayyavazhi. Apart from this, there is a tri-yearly celebration of Kodiyettru Thirunal in Swamithope. Another unique feature is the celebration of every day as a festival in Swamithope,(exclusive to Swamithope) called as \" 'Nitham Thirunal' \".\n\nIn addition to the philosophical concepts and mythology, the rituals of Ayyavazhi evolved in their own way. Most of the rituals have different operational and historical meanings. Historically, the rituals were used or viewed as an attempt to break the caste-based inequalities prevailed in the society of the time, and to strengthen and uplift the sociologically downtrodden and ill-treated. Examples of this include the charity on food as \" 'Anna Dharmam' \", physical as well as spiritual cleanliness through Thuvayal Thavasu, eliminating untouchability through Thottunamam, self-respect and courage through headgear, and unifying various castes through Muthirikkinaru.\n\nBut they too reveal, however, high philosophical ideas preached in a ritual language. The Muthirikkinaru and Thirunamam are treated religiously as if the \"Patham\" and \"Namam\" of them have the power to heal all sorts of mental as well as physical illness. Thuvayal thavasu is suggested as a training to reach the ultimate aim of Dharma Yukam. The use of the crown reveals that \"all are kings\", visualising an ideology similar to \"advaita\". Also, Ayyavazhi scriptures succeeded very much in helping to understand these philosophical ideas to the common mass which is very much unusual. The individual rituals, the ecstatic religiosity and the ritual healing, which are the features of Ayyavazhi worship, contributed to the formation of an idea of emancipation and a social discourse. Rituals attempt to uplift and treat the disenfranchised. Another important thing to be noted is the alternative phrases religiously used in Ayyavazhi universe different from Hinduism, to represent certain practices.\n\nThe formula of inclusiveness and exclusivity, as applied in the religio-cultural universe of Ayyavazhi, is unique because both the theories are mixed up in Ayyavazhi scriptures. The inclusive theory accepts the views of different religions for a certain period of time, and from then onwards exclusively rejects all of them in its narrative.\n\nAyyavazhi accepts different god-heads of several religions, like the concept of Allah and almost all the god-heads of Hinduism. It also says that the one and the same God incarnates in different parts of the world at different time for rescuing the people from sufferings. But due to the advent of Kaliyan and because of the cruel nature of his boons, for the first time, the supreme power Ekam incarnates in the world as Vaikundar, and so all the lesser god-heads and previous scriptures had lost their substances. So after the time of the Vaikunda Avatar, Vaikundar was said to be the only worshippable God and hence, the theology of Ayyavazhi was channeled towards exclusivism. The manner in which Akilam treats the scriptures of different religions is complicated. For instance, while there is no direct reference to the terms 'Christ' or 'Bible' anywhere in any of the Ayyavazhi texts, there is an indirect reference in Akilam thirteen which is supposed to be an implication that Christ was an incarnation of Narayana, but it was widely thought that it did not recognise the Bible composition. It seems the view of Akilam on Bible is \"it was created with the intention of man and not that of God\". In common, creation of religions and shaping individualities for them are heavily criticised. The concepts 'God' and 'Religion' are kept poles apart in Akilam, and it seems to maintain an ideology something like \" 'Accept God; Reject religion' \".\n\nAyyavazhi accepts various incarnations in Hinduism, but necessarily rejects the so-called ' \"Hindu\" ' scriptures. It initially accepts Vedas. Later since Kaliyan had bought the Vedas as boon they too lost their substance by the advent of Kaliyan, and so had gone invalid. It also says that he (Kaliyan) had performed several additions and had hidden some of their content. And hence God incarnated as Vaikundar. So for the present age, Akilam is said to be the only \" 'Book of Perfection' \". By this Ayyavazhi rejects all other scriptures and follows only its own. Akilam highly condemns the creation of religions especially exclusivistic religious and theological ideas. It shows them as the foremost \"Kali mayai\" (evil of Kali). The scriptures teach sensibly and symbolically that God and his activities are beyond the reach of religions. It also preaches about universal oneness.\n\nThe mythology of Ayyavazhi narrates that the essence of this vision is an account of a history – a past, a present and a future – meant by weaving together of empirical facts, historical events as well as mythical accounts. It moves around three axiomatic typologies, namely Santror, Kali Yukam and Dharma Yukam, placing their base on the concepts and events of previous yugas that are associated also with Hindu mythology. The basic concepts give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social.\n\nIt is closely linked to that of Hinduism. Akilam talks about the previous yugas and the evolution of Kroni through them. Events, mythical characters, and concepts are shared with Hinduism, though they may be engendered in different form. The number of Yugas and Avatars differs in Ayyavazhi from Hinduism. The personification of the entity of Evil for the current yuga, Kaliyan, is unique to Ayyavazhi. Akilam says that the true concepts were destroyed, so that all previous scriptures had lost their substances due to the advent of Kali.\n\nThe book also speaks of God incarnating in the world in the Kali Yukam (the present age) to destroy the evil spirit, the final and the most serious manifestation of Kroni. God incarnates as Vaikundar, and since Vaikundar lived recently, he was well known in history. So in the second part of the mythology many mythical as well as historical facts were woven together. Most of the events such as Muthirikkinaru, Wearing of Headgear during worship, Thuvayal Thavasu all were noted in history.\n\nThough there are quotes in Arul Nool to accredit the ten Avatars of Vishnu, it seems that they are not seen in equal status with these incarnations (as in the table). It was considered secondary to the primary avatars, who are associated with the destructions of the fragments of Kroni. This view is not inconsistent with Hinduism, as only Narasimha, Rama and Krishna are considered the primary avatars who are still worshipped. The other avatars are considered secondary avatars who are not worshipped.\n\nThe Santror is the subject of the religious vision of Ayyavazhi. There is both a religious and a social category in its connotation. In the social sense, it is believed that the term Santror fits rightly to the early \"Chanars\", who were called by the Arabs as \"Al Hind\", and known in biblical times as the \"People of Five Rivers\"; they are now scattered with more than 250 branches throughout the world. But in turn, in ideological sense and from the literary meaning of the term \"Santror\" in Tamil, it represents one who is noble and lives with dignity and supreme knowledge, giving an inclusive character and universal reach. Historians account that in ancient dravidian cultures, zealous devotees of God were called as 'Chanars'. A quote from Akilam too reads, \"Chanars (Santror) are those who have the ability to see 'the invisible' constantly.\"\n\nThe Santror are given a historical background in Ayyavazhi mythology as seven boys who were made to be born in the mythical garden Ayodha Amirtha Vanam \"(supposed to be between present-day Srirangam, Tamil Nadu and Triconamalee, Sri Lanka)\" by using the seven seeds from seven upper worlds, by Thirumal, to the seven virgins. Theologians interpret that these 'Seven boys' refer to the ancestors of the whole human race, and hence the term \"Santror\" refers to the entire human race. Their lineage started at the end phase of Dvapara Yukam and continued through the Kali Yukam into the Dharma Yukam. It is believed that Kali is being destroyed continuously by the activities of the Santror in the Path of Vaikundar, and so the Dharma Yukam unfolds eventually. In this sense they have a considerable roll in the destruction of Kali, the foremost evil.\n\nThe Ayyavazhi proposes an emancipatory utopia under the banner of Dharma Yukam. The basis of the belief is that Ayya Vaikundar had come to establish and rule as the everlasting king over the Dharma Yukam in the place of Kali Yukam after sentencing Kroni to hell by a final judgment from the Lion-throne of \"Dwaraka pathi\", the rising mythical landmass (which was sunken at the end of Dwapara Yuga by Krishna) located south east of present-day Kanyakumari. The Dharma Yukam is narrated as beyond the limits of time and space. It is often related to Moksha—the personal liberation, and to the state of 'Oneness' too.\n\nThe Hindu and Ayyavazhi ideologies are closely tied to each other. The place where Ayyavazhi and Hinduism depart from each other is at the advent of Kali Yuga. Akilam says that until the advent of Kali Yuga, the Vedas and all other Hindu scriptures remained with Divinity. Each of the gods referred to in the scriptures (Hindu) also remained with all their powers. But from the beginning of Kali Yuga, they and all their virtues collapsed. Kaliyan was a part of the mundane primordial manifestation who spread maya or illusion upon the existing scriptures and Devas. In Kali Yuga, all true scriptures are bound to maya and are unhelpful.\n\nThe reason, as stated in Akilam for the disintegration of the entire system is that, towards the end of Dwapara Yuga, there in Mount Kailash, Siva believing the words of devas, created Kaliyan without discussing to Vishnu, who had the responsibility to destroy Kaliyan as per previous deeds. So Vishnu refused to take birth in the world to destroy Kaliyan. So Siva and Brahma surrendered all their powers to Vishnu. Until this event, Siva was the supreme power as per Akilam. It is notable that this is a theological idea something similar to Shaivism, where Siva is supreme to all. Then onwards, however, Vishnu is the supreme power. Here the ideology changes similar to that of Vaishnavism. This supremacy of Vishnu remains like this from the beginning of Kali Yuga until the incarnation of Vaikundar, from where it changes further.\n\nDuring the incarnation, Vishnu himself can not incarnate directly in the world to destroy Kaliyan, since he (Kaliyan) had bought as boon the power of Devas, including Vishnu's, and spread it all over the world as maya. So God needs to be incarnated with a new set of rules and with unique importance. A total universal transformation of the power relation of god-heads, the rules of scriptures, the dharma, etc., took place, and Vaikundar was given birth by taking in the power of Ekam, by Lakshmi and Vishnu conjoining together inside the sea.\n\nAnd from now onwards all the powers were handled over from Vishnu to Vaikundar inside the sea. Siva, Vishnu and Brahma therefore form a part within Vaikundar. This ideology about Trimurthi (three are equal in power) is similar to that of Smartism. Vishnu alone forms a double role; one, within Vaikundar, and the other, as the father of him, remain inside the sea and regulating Vaikundar through Vinchais. After Vaikundar was given birth to, by assuming the Power of Ekam, Vaikundar was supreme to Vishnu and all other God-heads, though Vishnu playing the role of Father to Vaikundar. However, Vaikundar had to obey the order of Vishnu, since Vaikundar was given birth to perform the duties of Vishnu, which he (Vishnu) could not do. Vaikundar (and scriptures given by him) is the manifestation of the supreme Ekam so, in Ayyavazhi spirituality, he is the only worshippable universal power\n\nRegarding scriptures, the first part of Akilam is summed-up events of the previous yugas, which are present in Hindu scriptures. The second part says about the universal transformation and the uniqueness of Vaikundar and his incarnational activities. So as a summary, till the beginning of Kali yuga, what is Hinduism, that is Ayyavazhi. From then onwards for a series of reasons, Akilam says that 'Hindu' scriptures and its ideology had lost its purity and was destroyed, and so the Dharma was re-configured in the name of Akilam and Vaikundar and the 'Hindu' ideas were re-formed.\n\n\"Akilam\" points out its basis as a regeneration of Dharma in the form of an entirely new ideology. But today, most of the followers of Ayyavazhi address Vaikundar merely as the incarnation of Vishnu. Likewise, most of the Nizhal Thangals were called \"Narayana Swami Pathi\" or \"Narayana Swami Temple\", similar to Hindu Vaishnavism. Most of the followers also worship Hindu deities such as Kali, Hanuman and other folk deities in spite of the anti-polytheistic ideas based on Ayyavazhi scripture.\n\nSome followers of Ayyavazhi include Vaikundar as part of the ten Avatars of Vishnu as Kalki, while some denominations strongly advocate moksha, the personal liberation, though it is not stated directly in Akilam. Some even reject the Trinity conception in Ayyavazhi and believe Narayana to be the supreme universal power. The unique monotheistic belief which is the central theme of Akilam is completely unknown among most of the followers today. Deviating far away from the strict monotheistic teachings of Akilam, some thangals provides \"panividais\" for other lesser gods too.\n\nThe spread of Ayyavazhi among the common people was mainly due to the practice of Shamanism. Being similar to Hindus in almost all aspects Ayyavazhi followers are hard to be identified. The only sign to distinguish the practitioners of Ayyavazhi is the fact that they wore the Thirunamam (a sign on their forehead). The Nizhal Thangals are identified among the other temples by the fact that idols are replaced by mirrors in the Palliyarai. Only the recitations of a handful of scholars educated in the Ayyavazhi scriptures point out the real facts and concepts of Akilam and the philosophical and ideological deviation of Ayyavazhi from Hinduism. Not even the Payyans from the headquarters able to portray the Akilam-based ideology clearly. All these philosophical, ideological and religious variations in the society of Ayyavazhi make them hard to be identified and differentiated as a separate belief and instead taken as a Hindu sect.\n\nThere is a common belief that Ayya Vaikundar is a prophet and he had made many prophecies during his earthly years. On the contrary, there are no implications in Akilam or other books of Arul Nool that Vaikundar himself foretold anything, except in Thiruvasagam 4, Akilam:12. The common mis-understanding is because, the Akilam and Arul Nool includes hundreds of Prophecies and the contents of both the books is being divinely revealed to the Seedars by Vaikundar and the Seedars brought them to the written form. So, instead of the prophecies in both the books being considered that of Seedars it is mis-understood that the prophecies is of Vaikundar. Robert Caldwell, one among the very few historians of the contemporary period (who's views are always overwhelmingly negative on Vaikundar, since himself being a LMS Christian missionary), too referred to the then belief that seedars (disciples) profess to foretell events.\n\nAyyavazhi worship was marked by its simplicity. The absence of idol worship and priestly mediation, and inclusion of alternate type of centres of worship, the Pathis and Nizhal Thangals, were other characteristics of Ayyavazhi worship. Rituals of Ayyavazhi are a reform or revolutionary activity, focusing upon social equality, deviating from Hinduism. The rituals are also characterised and bound by religious beliefs that give them an alternative spiritual meaning. Its scriptures cover basic elements and ideas throughout Hinduism. They refer to Shastras, Agamas, Vedas and Puranas. But address them all to be gone awry by the Advent of Vaikundar, from where Ayyavazhi scriptures forms negative ideas over all other traditions. Though Ayyavazhi shares many god-heads with Hinduism, it weaves unique ideology and power assumption for them. Ayyavazhi can be portrayed as a \"Hindu renaissance\". Ayyavazhi is viewed as a reform movement too, as it brought many social changes there in the Tamil and keralite society during the 19th century.\n\nThe religious structure evolved in the path of Ayyavazhi scriptures and, as a result, it transfigured itself as an alternative religio-cultural system in the social category. The Ayyavazhis addressed their system as \"\"Path of God\"\" with the phrase \"\"Ayya Vazhi\"\". On one hand, they believe that their tradition had come to replace all old traditions (religions), but on the other hand, they believe that Ayyavazhi is the synopsis of the world's religious knowledge. On one hand, they believe that Vaikundar unified all deities within him; on the other, as all the previous had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar. Apart from this, Ayyavazhi has separate theology, mythology, holy places, worship centres, and ethics of its own.\n\nThough many new papers, academic researchers and some of its followers consider it as a separate religion, many of the followers are even of the opinion that this is but a Hindu sect rather than an autonomous religion. They indulge in the mystic practices of possessions and divinations similar to the tribal religions of Tamil Nadu. Also, many of its core beliefs are similar to some Hindu sects such as Advaita and Smartism.\n\nRegarding demographics, Ayyavazhi followers are highly concentrated in South India though found across India, comparatively in less numbers. In Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli districts of Tamil Nadu, it is very hard to find a village without a worship centre of Ayyavazhi. Apart from the listings from the religious headquarters (though it is evident that Ayyavazhi followers are spread across the India from university papers) there are no official figures for the number of followers of Ayyavazhi because they are considered Hindus in the census.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2022113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022113", "title": "The Sea Wolves", "text": "The Sea Wolves\n\nThe Sea Wolves is a 1980 war film starring Gregory Peck, Roger Moore and David Niven. The Panavision film is based on the book \"Boarding Party\" by James Leasor, which itself is based on a real incident which took place in World War II. The incident involved Operation Creek, the Calcutta Light Horse's covert attack on 9 March 1943 against a German merchant ship, which had been transmitting information to U-boats from Mormugão Harbour in neutral Portugal's territory of Goa.\n\nDuring World War II, German submarines are sinking thousands of tons of British merchant shipping. British intelligence, based in India, believes that information is being passed to the U-Boats by a radio transmitter hidden on board one of three German merchant ships interned in Goa, then a colony of Portugal. Since Portugal is neutral, the ships cannot be attacked by conventional forces.\n\nThe head of the Indian section of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) authorises attempts to kidnap and interrogate two known German agents, but these operations both fail. An approach is then made to a Territorial unit of British expatriates, the Calcutta Light Horse, to carry out the mission on its behalf. They all volunteer – all are trained in military skills and keen to 'do their bit'.\n\nWhilst the volunteers are trained, Stewart and Cartwright travel covertly to Goa. By a mixture of blackmail and bribery, they arrange diversions on the night of the raid. A party is to be held in the Governor's palace, a brothel will offer free entry to sailors from ships in the port and a Carnival with fireworks will be held. Stewart has a brief affair with Mrs. Cromwell, a mysterious and socially well-connected woman, who turns out to be a German agent and the main conduit to the German 'Master Spy', known to the Germans and the British by the code-name \"Trompeta\" (Trumpet). She is eventually killed by Stewart, after she attempts to kill him but not before she's killed Jack Cartwright.\n\nThe raiding party sail around the coast in a decrepit and barely seaworthy barge; they set mines on the hull of the German ships in Goa. They then board one which is being used to transmit signals to u-boats, catching the depleted crew off-guard. Despite Pugh's order that there be no shooting, several German sailors are killed. The ship is set alight and the party withdraws, watching as the ships sinks. The final scene show a surfacing German u-boat which is expecting to hear a signal from the now sunken ship.\n\nThe title music for \"The Sea Wolves\" was adapted by Roy Budd from the famous \"Warsaw Concerto\" of composer Richard Addinsell. Budd had, at the time, already composed or arranged numerous other film scores, notably those of \"The Wild Geese\" and \"Get Carter\". For \"The Sea Wolves\", Budd added lyrics by Leslie Bricusse to his, Budd's, arrangement of the \"Warsaw Concerto\" music, the resulting song being entitled \"The Precious Moments,\" sung by the British baritone Matt Monro, who had also sung title tracks for many other films.\n\n\"The Sea Wolves\" was, in fact, based on more than one clandestine operation of the Second World War. Some details of the film accord closely with those of Operation Postmaster, a January 1942 naval Special Operations Executive (SOE) raid on shipping in the harbour of Santa Isabel (now Malabo), on the island of Fernando Po, a Spanish (and therefore neutral) possession in the Bight of Biafra. Fernando Po (renamed Bioko) is now part of the republic of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nWhile there was indeed a German spy codenamed 'Trumpete' operating in Goa, he was a man named Robert Koch and both he and his wife Grete were kidnapped in 1942 by Colonel Stewart and Lieutenant Colonel Lewis Pugh and it's believed murdered in Castle Rock, Karnataka. The character 'Mrs. Cromwell' was purely invented as a romantic interest for Roger Moore's character. Similarly the character of Jack Cartwright was an invention for the film, although as noted below, the role of this character had a basis in fact.\n\nSOE undertook the Fernando Po operation in collaboration with the Maiden Honour Force, which was then under its control. That force, commanded by Major Gus March-Phillipps, was the precursor to the later and larger Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF), which was placed under the orders of the Combined Operations Command.\n\nIn the film, Trevor Howard's character arranges for the bordellos of Goa to be open and free of charge for the crews of the German target ships, in order to distract them. This was also the case in Operation Postmaster, in which, also, an SOE officer living on Fernando Po, Richard Lippett, operating under commercial cover as an employee of the Liverpool shipping enterprise John Holt & Co, persuaded the wife of a prominent German resident to hold a drunken party for the German and Italian ships' officers. In the film, a Portuguese official is suborned by British officer Roger Moore and arranges for a glittering reception held under the aegis of the Governor of Goa, for much the same purpose.\n\nThe Fernando Po/Operation Postmaster job was but one of a number of creative operations (some successful, some not) launched by SOE, particularly in the earlier part of the Second World War.\n\nAs far as the (real) Goa mission, Operation Creek, is concerned, the Calcutta Light Horse embarked on the barge \"Phoebe\" at Calcutta and sailed around India to Goa. After the German ship \"Ehrenfels\" was sunk in March 1943 by the team of British saboteurs, British intelligence dispatched an open message over the air, warning (falsely) that the British intended to invade Goa. The crews of the other two German merchant ships in the harbour, the \"Drachenfels\" and \"Braunfels\", received that message and scuttled their ships in Goa's harbour in the belief that they were protecting their ships from capture by the British. Italian ships in the harbour were also destroyed.\n\nThe film notes, in its closing credits, that during the first 11 days of March 1943, German U-boats sank 12 Allied ships in the Indian Ocean. But, after the Light Horse raid on Goa, only one ship was lost during the remainder of the month.\n\nThe film was originally known as \"Boarding Party\". According to the documentary \"The Last of the Gentleman Producers\", producer Euan Lloyd says that he originally planned to reunite Moore with Wild Geese co-stars Richard Burton and Richard Harris as Pugh and Grice.\n\nFifty percent of the budget was provided by Lorimar. They fell out with United Artists, their distributor, before the film was delivered. Lorimar subsequently formed a new relationship with Paramount but producer Euan Lloyd thought that studio regarded the film as \"the poor cousin\" and as a result it \"wasn't sold properly\".\n\nThe film reunited much of the cast and crew from 1978's \"The Wild Geese\", including actors Roger Moore, Kenneth Griffith, Jack Watson, Percy Herbert, Patrick Allen, Brook Williams, Patrick Holt and Terence Longdon, writer Reginald Rose, producer Euan Lloyd, director Andrew V. McLaglen, designer Syd Cain, and composer Roy Budd.\n\nIncidental music is from the Warsaw Concerto.\n\nFilming took place on location in Goa.\n\n"}

The movement was also known as Ribandism. The Ribbonmen was active against landlords and their agents, and opposed \"Orangeism\", the ideology of the Protestant Orange Order.\n\nThe Ribbon Society was principally an agrarian secret society, whose members consisted of rural Irish Catholics. The society was formed in response to the miserable conditions in which the vast majority of tenant farmers and rural workers lived in the early 19th century in Ireland. Its objective was to prevent landlords from changing or evicting their tenants. Ribbonmen also attacked tithe and process servers, and later evolved the policy of Tenants' Rights. The existence of \"ribandmen\" was recorded as early as 1817. The name is derived from a green ribbon worn as a badge in a button-hole by the members.\n\nDepending on the district, the society was variously known as the Fraternal Society, the Patriotic Association or the Sons of the Shamrock. The Ribbonmen's organisation was similar to that of the Whiteboys or the Defenders of earlier periods. They were organised in lodges, and during the 1820s were in contact with certain organisations of Radicals in England.\n\nThe ideology of the Ribbonmen supported the Catholic Association and the political separation of Ireland from Great Britain, and the rights of the tenant as against those of the landlord. The Ribbonmen were involved in violent (and sometimes deadly) riots with the Orange Order in the north of Ireland, and elsewhere used violence to resist paying tithes to the Protestant Church of Ireland. As the agitation for Catholic Emancipation grew, the tension between Ribbonism and Orangeism increased.\n\nOn 26 July 1813, the Battle of Garvagh in County Londonderry took place. Up to two hundred Catholic Ribbonmen attempted to destroy a tavern in Garvagh where the Orange Lodge met. They were armed with sticks and bludgeons, but Protestants were waiting inside armed with muskets and repelled them. One of the Ribbonmen was killed and the rest couldn't gain access to the tavern and dispersed. The clash was commemorated in the song \"The Battle of Garvagh\".\n\nOn 12 July 1830, Orange parades led to confrontations between Orangemen and Ribbonmen in Maghera and Castledawson in County Londonderry. Several Catholic homes were then burned by Protestants following these clashes. In November of the same year, ribbonmen attacked an Orange band, puncturing some of their drums. The Orangemen retaliated by burning the Catholic village of Maghery, County Armagh to the ground. 12 July 1849 saw the Dolly's Brae conflict. Up to 1400 armed Orangemen marched from Rathfriland to Tollymore Park near Castlewellan, County Down. When 1000 armed Ribbonmen gathered, shots were fired, Catholic homes were burnt and about 80 Catholics were killed.\n\nRibbonists were most active between 1835 and 1855 and in the Tithe War.\n\nHistorians disagree over the extent to which Ribbonism was an organised network of conspirators, as opposed to unrelated local groups whose similar actions were not coordinated. A.C. Murray suggests that any unsolved agrarian crimes after the Whiteboys and before the Land League were conveniently blamed on Ribbonism, with the 1871 report of the select committee into disturbances in County Westmeath being a case in point.\n\n\n"}

In that capacity he founded the London Positivist Society in 1867 and the Comtist Church of Humanity in 1878. He also wrote political tracts.\n\nHe was born at Leamington Hastings, Warwickshire, on 4 September 1818. He was educated under Dr. Arnold at Rugby, and at the University of Oxford, where he gained a scholarship at Wadham College, Oxford, matriculated on 23 February 1837, graduated B.A. (first class in literæ humaniores) in 1840, and proceeded M.A. in 1843. He was president of the Oxford Union in 1841.\n\nHe came to Oxford a typical pupil of Dr. Arnold, high-minded, intensely earnest, and latitudinarian in his theological opinions. \nHis success in the schools was naturally followed by election to a fellowship at his college; he was a master at Rugby from 1845 to 1848,; he resided as tutor for the next ten years. His influence upon his pupils is said to have been singularly bracing, morally as well as intellectually.\nThe turning-point in Congreve's life was a visit to Paris shortly after the French Revolution of 1848. He there met Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire and Auguste Comte, and the influence of Comte stayed with him. He adopted the entire positivist system, including the religious cult. He resigned his fellowship (1855), left Oxford, and soon afterwards founded the positivist community in London.\n\nCongreve studied medicine, and in 1866 was admitted member of the Royal College of Physicians. In the early days of the positivist movement he took the major part in the establishment of the propaganda in Chapel Street, Lamb's Conduit Street, London, and for some years worked harmoniously with Mr. Frederic Harrison and other leading positivists. In 1878, however, he issued a circular (17 June) in which he claimed for himself an authority independent of Pierre Laffitte, Comte's principal executor, and as such then universally acknowledged as the head of the positivist community. Some positivists joined him; others, among whom were Frederic Harrison, John Henry Bridges, Edward Spencer Beesly, Vernon Lushington, and James Cotter Morison, remained in union with Laffitte, and opened Newton Hall, Fetter Lane, London, as their place of meeting.\n\nCongreve used the freedom which this separation allowed him to elaborate a higher form of ritual. Despite failing health, he maintained his unfashionable opinions, and kept up his priestly functions, until his death, at Hampstead, on 5 July 1899. He was buried in Brookwood Cemetery.\n\nIn 1856, he married Mary, daughter of J. Berry of Warwick.\n\nCongreve published:\n\n\n"}

He heard Czech folksongs from time spent at his grandparents' farm as a youth. He started playing the piano aged 5, and composing and conducting aged 10. He began musical studies with Jaroslav Křička, and later teachers included Václav Talich and Rudolf Karel. He became a student at the Prague Conservatory at age 14, as a second-year student, where he studied composition with Vítězslav Novák and Karel Hoffmeister. Later, at Leipzig, he studied with Max Reger, who influenced Weinberger on the use of counterpoint. In September 1922, Weinberger moved to the United States where he took up a position as an instructor at Cornell University. Between 1922 and 1926 he was professor of composition at the Ithaca Conservatory (now the music school of Ithaca College), New York.\n\nWhen he returned to Czechoslovakia he was appointed director of the National Theater in Bratislava, and later received appointments in Eger, Hungary, and Prague. In 1926 Weinberger completed \"Schwanda the Bagpiper\" (\"Švanda Dudák\"), which became highly successful, with thousands of performances in hundreds of theatres including the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. His operetta \"Frühlingsstürme\" was first performed at the Theatre in Admiralspalast in Berlin on January 19, 1933 with Jarmila Novotná and Richard Tauber in the leading roles. Mary Losseff took over from Novotná in February, but the show was closed down by the Nazi government in March. His subsequent European works include the \"Passacaglia\" for orchestra and organ, \"Six Bohemian Dances\" for violin and piano, the opera \"The Outcasts of Poker Flat\" and a grand oratorio \"Christmas\", though none of them matched the success of \"Schwanda the Bagpiper\".\n\nIn 1939, after extensive travels to the United States, Bratislava and Vienna, he left Czechoslovakia to escape the Nazis and settled in New York state, teaching there and in Ohio. He wrote a number of works on commission from American orchestras. He became an American citizen in 1948.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Weinberger moved to St. Petersburg, Florida. In later life, he developed cancer of the brain. This, together with money worries and the neglect of his music, prompted him to take a lethal sedative overdose in August 1967. His wife, Jane Lemberger Weinberger (also known as Hansi), died on July 31, 1968.\n\nIn 2004 Czech pianist Tomáš Víšek and cellist František Brikcius organized a tour celebrating Weinberger's work.\n\nWeinberger composed over 100 works, including operas, operettas, choral works, and works for orchestra. However, the only one which is still performed is the opera \"Schwanda the Bagpiper\" (\"Švanda dudák\"), a worldwide success after its première in 1927. The opera is still performed occasionally, and the \"Polka and Fugue\" from it is often heard in a concert version. The artists of the Walt Disney studio considered making it into a segment for \"Fantasia 2000\", but instead chose Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F major, in the form of Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\".\n\nWeinberger used a varied musical language. His studies in Prague and Leipzig stressed formal control and contrapuntal mastery; following the example of his teachers, Křička, Novák and Reger, Weinberger's works exhibit control, but are also playful. This combination received both praise and criticism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is currently an assistant coach for the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL). He is the former head coach of the Buffalo Sabres. He also is the former head coach of the United States men's national ice hockey team. Prior to coaching the Sabres, Bylsma was the head coach for the Pittsburgh Penguins, whom he led to a Stanley Cup championship in 2009, just four months after being promoted to Pittsburgh's head coaching position.\n\nPrior to coaching the Penguins, he played as a forward in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, and coached in the American Hockey League (AHL). He was drafted in the sixth round (109th overall) of the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, by the Winnipeg Jets.\n\nDuring his high school days, Bylsma was a standout in many sports, including golf, baseball, and ice hockey. Bylsma graduated from Western Michigan Christian High School where he won the Class D golf individual championship as a freshman. He also played baseball and was the starting left fielder as a freshman on Christian's 1985 State championship team. In his senior year, he was a member of the all-state all-class \"Dream Team\" (the best player at each position in the state – all classes), and won many regional baseball honors.\n\nBylsma played amateur hockey in Muskegon Junior Hockey, Norton Shores Recreational Leagues, and Grand Rapids GRAHA before playing Junior \"B\" hockey in Canada for the St. Marys Lincolns and the Oakville Blades of the Ontario Hockey Association. Bylsma went on to play college hockey at Bowling Green State University from 1988–1992 and was drafted by the Winnipeg Jets in his freshman year. He was twice selected to the Central Collegiate Hockey Association All Academic Team and once earned Honorable Mention. He was a Bowling Green Scholar Athlete all four years and won the Jack Gregory Award for the highest grade point average on the team in his Sophomore season and the Howard Brown Coaches' Award for excellence in his senior year. Bylsma is one of the few players in the CCHA to have scored a shorthanded goal while his team was two men short.\n\nDespite being drafted by the Winnipeg Jets, Bylsma never played a game for them, and was signed by the Los Angeles Kings in the summer of 1994. During the 1994–95 labor stoppage, Bylsma earned the nickname \"Disco Dan\". The nickname was adopted by teammates while playing for a minor league team in Phoenix. Veteran goaltender Byron Dafoe already went by Bylsma's former moniker of \"Bysie\" so the name \"Disco Dan\" was given due to Bylsma's penchant for dancing in the locker room.\n\nHe played parts of five seasons for the Kings, acting as a defensive forward. In his first season, when he played only four games for the Kings, he was captain of their International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Phoenix Roadrunners. He also played for the Long Beach Ice Dogs, who were the Kings' IHL affiliate after the Roadrunners folded in 1997. Bylsma played 95 American Hockey League (AHL) games with the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks, the Lowell Lock Monsters, the Springfield Falcons, the Albany River Rats, the Moncton Hawks and the Rochester Americans, and reached the Calder Cup Finals in 1994.\n\nSigned as a free agent by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the summer of 2000, Bylsma was a steadying influence on a rebuilding Anaheim team, and was made an alternate captain. In his second season, he set a career high in points (17).\n\nBylsma struggled his entire career to stay in the NHL, mostly due to a lack of natural offensive ability (his primary role in the NHL had always been penalty killing). Injuries took a toll in later years, and before being put on waivers in January 2004, Bylsma missed 31 games due to knee surgery. He retired from playing following the 2003–04 season.\n\nBylsma served as an assistant coach with the AHL's Cincinnati Mighty Ducks (2004–05) and the NHL's New York Islanders (2005–06). During the 2008–09 season, Bylsma coached the Penguins' AHL affiliate Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins.\n\nOn February 15, 2009, with the Pittsburgh Penguins struggling to make the playoffs, the Penguins organization announced that it had relieved head coach Michel Therrien of his duties and had promoted Bylsma to serve as interim head coach of the team. At 38, he was the youngest head coach in the NHL at the time. Through his first 25 games as Penguins' coach, his 18–3–4 record amounted to 40 points—the second most of any coach in NHL history through their first 25 games. On April 28, Penguins General Manager Ray Shero announced that Bylsma had been named permanent head coach of the team. On June 12, 2009 Bylsma led the Pittsburgh Penguins to a Stanley Cup championship, becoming the 14th coach and the second mid-season replacement to win the Stanley Cup in their first season. While the win made him just the fifth ever American-born coach to win the cup, he also became the third American in the last five seasons to do so. Bylsma was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's most outstanding coach for the 2010–2011 season due to the Penguins still being a contender for the Stanley Cup without his two star players Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin.\n\nOn April 22, 2013, Bylsma became the fastest NHL coach ever to reach 200 wins with a 3-1 win over the Ottawa Senators. On June 30 of the same year, Bylsma was appointed head coach of the United States Olympic Hockey Team for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. On January 7, 2014, a month before coaching at the Winter Olympics, Bylsma became the winningest coach in Penguins history (233 wins) with a 5-4 shootout victory over the Vancouver Canucks. On April 4, 2014, Dan Bylsma became the fastest NHL coach to reach 250 wins, leading his team to a 4-2 victory over the Winnipeg Jets. He accomplished the feat in 395 games. On June 6, 2014 he was fired by the Pittsburgh Penguins, shortly after Jim Rutherford was announced as the team's new general manager.\n\nHe remained on the Penguins' payroll, with no job in the organization, through the 2014–15 season. Following that season, the Penguins granted him permission to seek employment elsewhere. On May 28, 2015, Bylsma was named head coach of the Buffalo Sabres, signing a five-year contract. Bylsma was the Sabres second choice for coach after Mike Babcock, who they heavily pursued before Babcock signed with the divisional rival Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nOn April 20, 2017, Bylsma was released by the Buffalo Sabres. The transaction came after rumors leaked that Bylsma was at odds with many of the Sabres players, including star Jack Eichel, who allegedly stated he would not sign a contract extension with the team had Bylsma remained head coach. On June 22, 2018, Bylsma was hired as an assistant coach for the Detroit Red Wings.\n\n\n"}

He was influenced in his childhood by gospel music. According to various sources, he has been a comedian, a fashion model, a boxer, a preacher, a professional surfer, and a New York City cab driver. Before embarking on a music career, White attended film school at New York University. Soon after finishing his lengthy thesis at the university, White entered a self-described \"deep hole of sickness and depression and poverty.\" However, during a party organized by film school friends, White began to perform, and began writing material for an album soon afterward.\n\nWhite's live shows, particularly when touring solo, can be characterized as off-beat, blending his playlist with open discussion with the audience, anecdotal storytelling derived from his own life experiences, all of which is typically humorous and insightful, with a deep sense of his feeling for the broken beauty of humanity. He has stated during shows that ultimately he wishes to return to the academic field, particularly as a professor, rather than continue as a professional, touring musician. Much of this is due to his family life, which he has stated takes priority in his life and is the reason he does not like touring very much. His sister, Katherine Pratt, teaches at Loyola Law School.\n\nWhite's band has no fixed lineup, but regularly includes musicians such as Dan Nettles (Electric Guitar); Peter Alvanos, Robby Handley, Steve Bishop Maples (Bass); Rob McMaken (Dulcimer, Acoustic Guitar, Mandolin), Marlon Patton (Drums) and Mark Tulk (Keys).\n\nWhite's albums often feature collaborations. On \"Wrong-Eyed Jesus\", folk singer Victoria Williams sings on the track \"Angel-Land\"; British electronica trio Morcheeba produced and played on three tracks on \"No Such Place\". Aimee Mann, Barenaked Ladies, and jazz guitarist Bill Frisell appear on \"Drill a Hole in That Substrate and Tell Me What You See\", which was produced by Joe Henry, Tucker Martine, and Jim White himself. In an interview with David Byrne, White describes the making of the album. In 2006, Jim White collaborated with Johnny Dowd and Willie B and formed a group called Hellwood; in 2006, the band toured throughout Europe to promote the album \"Chainsaw of Life\".

The carrier specialises in short notice ACMI and wet lease operations as well as ad-hoc passenger and cargo charter services to tour operators, corporations, governments and the sports and entertainment sectors. The company holds a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence, permitting it to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats and currently operates a fleet of 12 aircraft.\n\nFounded in 1988 as a subsidiary of the Artac Freight and Shipping Group, Titan Airways was named after its first aircraft type, a Cessna 404 Titan, however, the airline's logo draws reference to Titan a moon of Saturn. Their Cessna 404 aircraft were mainly used to carry car parts between various Ford/General Motors facilities in the UK and Europe, but it was also available for ad hoc freight charters and ultimately passenger charters. By 1993, the fleet had grown to include an Embraer Emb 110 Bandeirante, two Short SD 330s and three SD 360s.\n\nThe airline's success attracted investment group 3i which took a stake in the company in 1995. Two ATR 42s were also added before the first jet – a BAe146-200QC – was acquired in 1996. This was the first containerised jet used by the Royal Mail, but it also operated many passenger charter flights and airline sub-services. As the Mail contract grew in size, the first of five Boeing 737-300s was introduced in 1999.\n\nThe airline has been consistently profitable, turning a profit in 24 of its 27-year history and has ranked in the \"Sunday Times\" Profit Track 100 league table on four occasions since the year 2000. In the early 2000s (decade) Titan Airways found an additional niche in the market, pioneering a rapid response Go Now sub-charter service for airlines experiencing operational problems. The innovative concept earned the company Queen's Award for Enterprise in 2001.\n\nDemand by customer airlines for more seats and greater range led to the acquisition of two 757-200s in 2003 and 2005, with one aircraft having a VIP interior for corporate use. In 2006 Titan achieved ETOPS rating for the aircraft, enabling long haul charters to the US and Middle East. The largest aircraft in the Titan family, a 265-seat B767-300, joined the fleet in 2009, and the smallest, a new Cessna Citation CJ2+ arrived in December 2011.\n\nIn 2012 Titan became an independent company, following a management buyout that leaves Gene Willson, Managing Director and one of the original founders, as the sole share holder.\n\nTitan added its first Airbus aircraft, an Airbus A320, to its fleet in early Spring 2013. This addition was the first step in its long-term fleet strategy which will see Titan's current fleet of Boeing aircraft gradually being replaced by Airbus aircraft over the next five to six years. Two additional A320s joined the fleet in early 2015.\n\nSeptember 2015 saw Titan announce that they plan to add an Airbus A319 and an Airbus A321 to the fleet before the start of Summer 2016 and that they are considering adding the smallest member of the Airbus A320 family, an Airbus A318, to their fleet.\n\nTitan Airways provides short, medium or long term wet and damp lease operations worldwide to third party carriers. \nThe UK carrier also operates short notice sub-charter services, with the ability to launch aircraft within 60 minutes when airline customers experience unexpected operational problems.\n\nTitan Airways operates charter flights on a seasonal basis to a number of destinations on behalf of UK-based tour operators and cruise companies. Longstanding tour operator partnerships include regular operations from UK airports to Calvi in Corsica, Lourdes and Chambéry in France, Turin in Italy, Dalaman in Turkey, Preveza in Greece and Banjul in the Gambia.\n\nAside from these regular seasonal routes, Titan Airways operates long and short haul flights on an ad hoc basis on behalf of individuals, blue chip companies, Premier League football teams, high-profile personalities and pop/rock groups.\n\nTitan Airways sometimes uses their aircraft in product launches, trade shows, promotional events and hospitality trips for other companies.\n\nTitan Airways’ cooperation with the Royal Mail dates back to the early 1990s when operations began with the carrier's Shorts 360 and ATR42 aircraft. In 1996 the carrier's BAe 146-200 fleet superseded the smaller aircraft before being joined, and ultimately replaced, by Titan's Boeing 737-300QC's. The aircraft operated on behalf of the Royal Mail with nightly flights from Stansted to Edinburgh and to Belfast.\n\nTitan Airways carries out flights for the FCO and flights for the Home Office\n\nTitan Airways' Boeing 767 operated to the Falkland Islands on behalf of the UK Ministry of Defence for two years until September 2012; with twice-weekly flights departing from RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, to RAF Mount Pleasant via RAF Ascension Island. Titan Airways' RJ100 aircraft has been based in Sharjah on contract to the UK MoD since 2011. The RJ100 superseded Titan Airways' BAe 146 operations in the Persian Gulf region which dated back to 2009.\n\nAs of January 2020, the Titan Airways fleet consists of the following aircraft:\n\n"}

Following the success of Carey's previous two albums and the growing critical commentary on her lack of concert tours and unsubstantial televised performances, Sony BMG organised a performance show at the Kaufman Astoria Studios, New York on March 16, 1992. The show, titled \"MTV Unplugged\", originally aired on MTV to help promote Carey's album \"Emotions\", as well as help shun critics who deemed Carey a possible studio artist. However, after its success, the show was released to the public as an EP, with an accompanying VHS titled \"MTV Unplugged +3\".\n\nUpon release, the EP garnered generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented Carey's vocals. Commercially, the album was a success, peaking at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200, and was certified four times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of two million copies within the United States. Additionally, the EP experienced strong success in several international markets, such as the Netherlands and New Zealand, where it reached number one and was certified double Platinum. \"MTV Unplugged\" peaked within the top five in the United Kingdom, and in the top ten in Australia and Canada.\n\n\"I'll Be There\" was chosen as the lead single from the album. Due to its critical success until that point, it was released one month before its parent EP, eventually becoming Carey's sixth chart topper in the United States, and one of the few songs to do so by two different acts. Globally, the song was successful, topping the charts in Canada, the Netherlands and New Zealand, as well as attaining the top five position in Ireland and the United Kingdom. After its success, \"If It's Over\", a song from Carey's second studio effort \"Emotions\" was released, due to its exposure on the show and EP.\n\nAfter the release of Carey's second studio album, \"Emotions\" (1991), critics began wondering whether Carey would finally embark on a worldwide tour, having not toured to promote her self-titled debut album. Although Carey had done several sporadic award show appearances, as well as television program performances, critics began accusing Carey of being a studio artist, not capable of delivering or replicating the same quality vocals live, especially her whistle register. During several televised interviews, Carey addressed the accusations, claiming that she did not tour out of fear of the long travel times and distances, as well as the strain on her voice performing her songs back-to-back. However, in hopes of putting any claims of her being a manufactured artist to rest, Carey and Walter Afanasieff decided to book an appearance on \"MTV Unplugged\", a television program aired by MTV. The show's purpose was to present name artists, and feature them \"unplugged\" or stripped of studio equipment. While live, the show allowed several musicians and back up vocalists, while recorded in an acoustic setting. The issues Carey faced once the show was booked was the content; she didn't know what material to present at the intimate concert. While Carey felt strongly of her more soulful and powerful songs, it was decided that her most popular content to that point would be included. Days prior to the show's taping, Carey and Afanasieff thought of adding a cover version of an older song, in order to provide something different and unexpected. They chose \"I'll Be There\", a song made popular by The Jackson 5 in 1970, rehearsing it few times before the night of the show.\n\nCarey's performance was recorded on March 16, 1992 at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. The show featured a number of musicians, back-up vocalists and just a crew of ten, for filming and recording. Directed by Larry Jordan, who previously worked with Carey on the music video for \"Someday\". Dana Jon Chapelle was chosen as the sound mixer, having worked with Carey on her previous two studio albums. The show began with the song \"Emotions\" Carey entered the studio dressed in a black jacket and matching pants and boots. Prior to the song's studio introduction, Carey opened the song with an impromptu gospel and a cappella number, eventually leading to the song's chorus led by David Cole. After the song, Carey introduced the band and staff; to her left was a four-piece string section with Belinda Whitney Barnett, Cecilia Hobbs-Gardner, Wince Garvey and Laura Corcos, while San Shea played the harpsichord and harmonium. The show's rhythm section was led by Gigi Gonaway on the drums, Randy Jackson on bass, Vernon Black on guitar, and Sammy Figueroa and Ren Klyce, both percussionists. Additionally, Carey had ten background singers on stage, led by Trey Lorenz and Patrique McMillan. The next song on the set-list was \"If It's Over\", a collaboration with Carole King. Walter Afanasieff replaced Cole on the piano, during which time a set of five male musicians were brought on stage. They were Lew Delgado, baritone saxophone; Lenny Pickett, tenor saxophone; George Young, alto saxophone; Earl Gardner, trumpet; and Steve Turre, trombone. They had been present during Carey's live performance of the song on \"Saturday Night Live\" a few months prior. As Carey introduced the song, she said \"this next song I wrote with one of my idols, Carole King\", beginning the performance shortly after. For \"Someday\", Cole returned to the stage, replacing Afanasieff on the keyboard. During the song, Carey would often place her index finger over her left ear, especially while using the whistle register. She later explained to the audience that it would help her in hearing herself more precisely, something needed to properly execute a higher ranged note. Once again, as Carey began \"Vision of Love\", her \"first single ever\", Afansieff swapped positions with Cole. The performance varied heavily from the studio version, as it was more low key and only used voices in a cappella form, without any heavy instrumentation. Prior to beginning the fifth song on the set-list, \"Make It Happen\", Afanasieff shared the organ with Cole, playing the bass while the latter handled the treble. After the song began, the back-up began \"piling their vocals\" over Carey's, according to author Chris Nickson, and allowed the song to attain a more \"churchy feel\". He felt the song was superior to the studio version, due to its stripped performance and vocals:\n\n\"The roughness of this version succeeded in a way the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished.\"\n\nSoon after completing \"Make It Happen\", Carey eagerly presented the final song on the set list, \"I'll Be There\". The way the song was arranged, Carey took Michael Jackson's lead, while Trey Lorenz sang the second lead, originally sung by Jermaine Jackson. After performing the song alongside a very simple arrangement and minimal instrumentals, the back-up singers began humming to the tune of \"Can't Let Go\", leading Carey to present \"another final\" song for the show. Several days after the concert, Carey sat down with Melinda Newman from \"Billboard\", telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective. She said \"\"Unplugged\" taught me a lot about myself because I tend to nitpick everything I do and make it a bit too perfect because I'm a perfectionist.

Carey's version was met with critical acclaim and extended popularity, leading to it being shown more often than usual. Fans from around the United States made multiple requests for the show to be aired on television, and by the end of April 1992, Carey's episode of MTV Unplugged had aired over three-times as much as an average episode would. The concert's success tempted Sony officials to use it as some form of an album. However, Carey and Afansieff were already making headway on a new album set tentatively for release in 1993. This being so, Sony decided to release it as an EP, selling for a reduced price due to its shorter length.\n\nAfter the success of the EP's lead single \"I'll Be There\", Sony chose to release not only the EP, but a VHS accompaniment package; a video of the actual concert titled \"MTV Unplugged +3\". Aside from featuring the seven song's performed at Kaufman Astoria Studios, it held three music videos; \"Can't Let Go\", \"Make It Happen\", and a rare remix version and video of \"Emotions\". The video peaked atop the \"Billboard\" video chart, and was certified Platinum by the RIAA, denoting shipments of 100,000 units throughout the United States.\n\n\"MTV Unplugged +3\" garnered generally positive reviews from music critics. Allmusic editor Shawn M. Haney gave the video three out of five stars, praising Carey's vocals as well as her cover of \"I'll Be There\". Haney wrote \"Gradually, the power and esteem of these tales lift to new heights and remain at a peak with the breathtaking, moment-making performance of \"I'll Be There,\" a charming song first cut by The Jackson 5.\" Writing for the \"St. Petersburg Times\", Sabrina Miller called Carey an \"artiste\" and wrote \"Programs like \"MTV Unplugged\" showcase talent like hers with an exclamation point.\" Journalist and writer from \"The New York Times\" Jon Pareles branded the performance \"shrewd\", and claimed Carey's cover of \"I'll Be There\" \"set off fireworks\". A writer for \"Entertainment Weekly\" called the show a \"vocal Tour de force\", and wrote \"in addition to her breathtaking pipes, she has developed a commanding stage presence.\" Additionally, they felt Carey's performance of \"I'll Be There\" was \"killer\" and concluded their review with \"In the process, this rare public appearance reminded us there was a big-league performer inside that party dress.\"\n\nAfter the decision to release the EP was made, Sony decided to release Carey's live version of \"I'll Be There\" as the only single, due to its critical success. The song debuted at number thirteen on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming Carey's highest debut on the chart at the time. After four weeks, the song topped the chart, becoming Carey's sixth number one in the United States, and spending two weeks there. Its success across the globe was strong, peaking at number one on the singles charts in Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, and reached number two and three in the United Kingdom and Ireland, respectively. \"I'll Be There\" was certified Gold by both the Australian Recording Industry Association and Recording Industry Association of New Zealand, denoting shipments of 35,000 and 7,500 units of the song in their respective countries. After its success, \"If It's Over\", a song from Carey's second studio effort \"Emotions\" was released, due to its exposure on the show and EP. It was given a very limited release, and only charted in the Netherlands, peaking at number 80.\n\n\"MTV Unplugged\" garnered generally positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor Shawn M.

In its third week, the album peaked at number three. In total, the album remained in the top-twenty for fourteen weeks, and on the chart for fifty-seven (making one re-entry). \"MTV Unplugged\" was certified four times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipment of two million copies throughout the country. As of November 2018, Nielsen SoundScan estimates actual sales of the album at 2.8 million in the United States. On June 20, 1992, \"MTV Unplugged\" entered the Canadian \"RPM\" Singles Chart at number thirty-seven, eventually peaking at number six five weeks later. During the week of November 22, 1992, the album spent its last week on the chart, exiting at number eighty-seven after spending twenty-four weeks on the album's chart. To date, the album has been certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), denoting shipments of 70,000 units throughout the country. In Australia, the album debuted at number thirty-four on the ARIA Charts, during the week ending July 12, 1992. Weeks later, it peaked at number seven, where it remained for four consecutive weeks, and a total of twenty-five weeks in the top 50, and thiry-three weeks in the top 100. The album was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of 70,000 copies.\n\nOutside the United States, the album experienced success in several European markets. In Austria, \"MTV Unplugged\" entered the albums chart at number thirty-nine, eventually peaking number twenty-one and spending a total of ten weeks on the chart. In France, the album peaked at number twenty-two, and was certified double-Gold by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP), with estimated sales of 144,000 copies. In the Netherlands, the EP entered the MegaCharts at number sixty-six during the week of June 20, 1992. It eventually peaked at number one, staying there for three consecutive weeks, and a total of 116 weeks on the chart. The Nederlandse Vereniging van Producenten en Importeurs van beeld- en geluidsdragers (NVPI) certified the album double-Platinum, denoting shipments of 200,000 units throughout the country. \"MTV Unplugged\" entered the New Zealand Albums Chart at number four during the week of August 2, 1992. After spending three weeks at number one, and a total of nineteen in the chart, the album was certified double-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ). On the Swiss Albums Chart dated September 13, 1992, the album reached its peak position of number nineteen. After only five weeks charting within the country, it was certified Gold by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). In the United Kingdom, the album debuted and peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart, during the week dated July 18, 1992.

It was released November 20, 2001 on Five Minute Walk records.\n\nFive Iron continued their tradition of tongue-in-cheek lyrics on songs such as \"Pre-Ex-Girlfriend\" and \"You Can't Handle This\". The album also tackles serious issues, elevating the social commentary to what \"HM\" characterized as a \"new level of brutal honesty.\" \"Far, Far Away\" was inspired by The Seekers song \"Come the Day\" and \"The Day We Killed\" by Dee Brown's book \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\". The latter song references Crazy Horse, an Indian chief, to speak about racism toward Native Americans. Another theme visited on this album is consumerism in \"Vultures\" and \"Blue Mix\". \"Blue Mix\" specifically addresses practices of the music industry which Roper sees as disparaging when copied within the Christian music industry. Practices attacked include blue mixing, or limiting opening bands sound so that the headliners sound the best, and merchandising controls that raise profit margins at the expense of the band's freedom. As Roper stated to \"HM\": \"It really bothers me how often that happens in the Christian industry... it's not okay to do that kind of stuff.\" \"Car\" is dedicated to the memory of Carlos Ortega, brother of Leanor. It references a poem by E.E. Cummings to remind the listener that each day is a blessing to be cherished.\n\nAccording to the band, \"the '2' in the title doesn't signify anything, it is simply a reference to 1984's breakdancing film, \"\".\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2022213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022213", "title": "PANOSE", "text": "PANOSE\n\nThe PANOSE System is a method for classifying typefaces solely on their visual characteristics, developed by Benjamin Bauermeister. It can be used to identify an unknown font from a sample image or to match a known font to its closest visual neighbor from a font pool. The word \"PANOSE\" is composed of letters taken from the six classes in which the creator of the system organized the Latin alphabet.\n\nThe original PANOSE System was developed in 1985 by Benjamin Bauermeister. In 1988, it was published by Van Nostrand Reinhold Company Inc. under the title \"A Manual of Comparative Typography: The PANOSE System\". This initial version of the PANOSE system consisted of seven classification categories, and was based on subjective visual parameters.\n\nIn 1990, the Weight category was added, and the Arm Style category was split off from the Stroke Variation category, bringing the number of classification categories to 9. Objective classification criteria were also added at this time.\n\nIn 1991, the Family Kind category was added, completing the PANOSE 1.0 definition.\n\nIn 1992, there were attempts made to classify Han ideographic typefaces, which allows applications to suggests the most appropriate Latin typeface to match a given Han ideographic typeface. Transliteral mapping could also be used to match between, for example, decorative or script faces and text equivalents.\n\nIn 1993, Mapper Application Interface (MAI) was developed. PANOSE 2.0 was also released in the same year, which is the basis for Hewlett Packard's Infinifont font synthesis technology.\n\nPANOSE was incorporated into a variety of digital font metadata tags in 1992 by ElseWare Corporation. The classification system, its matching algorithms reference databases, classification parameters, and trademarks were purchased by Hewlett Packard in 1995. A font synthesis engine named Infinifont was also purchased by Hewlett Packard at that time.\n\nThe PANOSE 1.0 definition was published in 1988. A PANOSE classification number consists of 10 concatenated values. Each value from a given category was computed from a specific visual metric, such as the weight of the font and the presence or absence of serifs. Special values \"Any\" (0) and \"No Fit\" (1) exist for every category, which have specific meanings to the mapper. \"Any\" means match that digit with any available digit, which allows the mapper to handle distortable typefaces. \"No Fit\" means that the item being classified does not fit within the present system.\n\nThe standard classifies fonts in following categories in following order:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the PANOSE digits for Times New Roman are:\nThe system stores actual measurement data under the Rich Font Description (RFD) rather than bucketing it, which allows the matching system to use mathematical distance rather than penalty tables. It is designed for distortable font technologies (e.g.: Multi Master fonts). The system offers multiple methods for distortable fonts.\n\nThe original classification system was changed from a bucket-based system to an arithmetic system (except the Family from PANOSE 1.0 and derivatives), and was expanded to following categories:\n\nEach PANOSE 2.0 category value is a signed 16-bit number (from −32,768 to 32,767; only ranges between −10,000 and 10,000 are defined), where value zero (0) is considered to be the \"normal\" for the digit. For example, digit zero for the weight represents medium weight. The \"any\" value from PANOSE 1.0 is translated to a \"don't care\" parameter and is replaced by the more comprehensive distortable font descriptions.\n\nThe Family category is replaced by Class and Genre, where Class indicates a font's language and character set, where Genre indicates text faces, display faces, symbol faces, and so on. PANOSE matching software is designed to match fonts with different Class, but same Genre. The same Genre can have different meaning in different Class, so the matching heuristic decides the closeness of fonts based on adjusted values based on Class, rather than raw PANOSE values within the fonts themselves.\n\nClassification Procedures are objective measurement techniques used to assign a PANOSE number to a font.\n\nThe PANOSE Mapper software determines the closest possible font match on any given system by comparing the PANOSE numbers of the requested and available fonts. The individual PANOSE digits are compared, weighted by their typographic importance, and summed to provide a numerical visual distance. Typographic importance is derived by assigning weights to each digit; for example, a font's weight (regular, bold, demibold, etc.) is more important than its contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes).\n\nPANOSE 1.0 table is supported in TrueType font format.\n\nPANOSE 2.0 is used in ElseWare Corporation's Infinifont parametric font generation system.\n\nIn 1996, during the W3C's draft process for CSS1, Hewlett Packard proposed a PANOSE syntax extension for font substitution. It was not included in the final CSS1 recommendation partly because of licensing concerns. Although Hewlett Packard Co. is not interested in profiting from PANOSE, it will negotiate licenses on a time and materials basis.\n\nPANOSE 1.0 is supported in SVG since version 1.0 in the \"font-face\" element under \"panose-1\" attribute. In CSS2, it is used in the \"panose-1\" property, which was removed in CSS2.1, and was reintroduced in \"CSS3 module: Web Fonts\" specifications.\n\nIn Office Open XML, it is part of WordProcessingML.\n\nPANOSE 1.0 is used in Rich Text Format Specification 1.7.\n\n"}
{"id": "2022221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022221", "title": "Formula Ford", "text": "Formula Ford\n\nFormula Ford (known as F1600 and Formula F in the United States because of a rule change in 2009) is an entry-level class of single seater, open-wheel formula racing. The various championships held across the world form an important step for many prospective Formula One drivers. Formula Ford has traditionally been regarded as the first major stepping stone into formula racing after karting. The series typically sees professional career minded drivers enter alongside amateurs and enthusiasts. Success in Formula F can lead directly to other junior formulae such as a Formula Renault 2.0 and Formula Three.\n\nFormula Ford is not a one-make championship. It allows freedom of chassis design, engine build and numerous technical items of specification on the car. This opens the door to many chassis manufacturers, large and small. Many other single-seater formulae impose fixed specifications. Only two other professional single seater racing formulae in the world offer the same freedom of chassis and engine build: Formula Three and Formula One.\n\nThe origins of Formula Ford began in the early 1960s, where motor racing schools such as the Jim Russell school and Motor Racing Stables featured single seat Formula Junior and Formula Three-like machines from world class constructors like Cooper and Lotus. Many aspiring Formula One stars looked to these schools in the hope of learning the craft and also looking the part. However, although there was no shortage of aspiring drivers, these schools had much trouble avoiding bankruptcy. The 1-litre Formula Three engines, the 1.1-litre Coventry Climax FJ and later the \"Kent\" engine from the Ford Anglia 105E, cost around £3,000 at the time in addition to the Dunlop racing tires which cost £80 a set. Furthermore, these engines were incredibly fragile and had a tendency to self-destruct. All these factors contributed to a steep maintenance and upkeep cost of the schools.\n\nIn 1963, Geoff Clarke; the owner of Motor Racing Stables, moved his racing school to the Brands Hatch circuit. This brought him in contact with John Webb; managing director of developments at Brands Hatch. At about this time, two of the school’s Lotus Formula Junior chassis were fitted with a standard 1498cc Ford \"Kent\" pushrod engine as featured in the recently introduced Cortina GT saloon. The 1500 Cortina, with its reliability and horsepower output fairly close to “F3 proper” proved a resounding success in the school. The earliest experiments with radial tires bore fruit as well: the students of the day did not care that these were not the racing engines or racing tires, just that the cars were equal.\n\nAt an informal meeting at the December 1966 racing car show day at Olympia, Webb and Clarke were discussing the possibility of building a fleet of identical open wheel race cars based on the success of combining the Ford power plant and road wheels, radial tires, and Formula Junior style chassis. Not only would they make ideal school cars, but would also provide a new entry level formula for a race series. They felt if they called it “Formula Ford\" they could get backing from Ford itself. Webb was on the phone the next day to Ford competition manager Henry Taylor, who agreed to provide Clarke and MRS with 54 Cortina GT engines at £50 each (£15 below retail). Webb also approached the Royal Automobile Club's competition director, to establish rules for this new class. Late in 1967, Ford announced the new Formula Ford class to the world.\n\nClarke then set about approaching existing race car constructors to build the first Formula Fords. Both Bruce McLaren and Jack Brabham turned down the idea; Colin Chapman however dusted off the obsolete Lotus 31 Chassis and reinvented it as the Lotus 51. \nHe agreed to provide the first of two 25 car batches at £850 per car. The only stipulation Chapman had was that a Renault gear box was used. This proved to be fundamental weak point in the drive train. Difficulty with the Renault transmission resulted in a failure to continue with the second batch of cars for MRS.\n\nRussell approached Chapman to supply Formula Ford cars for his own school. Chapman insisted Russell match Clarke’s 50 car order; Russell would only commit to 10 cars so the deal fell through. Russell then approached Taylor who built the Alexis car and a deal was struck to jointly produce the Russell-Alexis. This car had a Hewland racing gear box which made the car more expensive (£999), but was more reliable and allowed interchangeable ratios.\n\nThe first standalone Formula Ford race took place at Brands Hatch on July 2, 1967. Of the 20 cars that competed, 10 were MRS Lotus 51s, including the eventual winner, Ray Allen. The Russell-Alexis car won its debut race in August 1967, and by 1968 54 Russell-Alexis had been sold. Based on this success Russell opened two more racing schools in Britain, another in Canada, and another in the United States.\n\nChapman and his Lotus 51 did recover, replacing the troublesome Renault gear box with the Hewland unit, even claiming Russell as a customer in 1968. Also in 1968, Meryln debuted as a Formula Ford constructor, dominating sales for that year. Other new manufactures included Crosslé Car Company, Dulon, Elden Racing Cars, Hawke Racing Cars and Royale Racing Cars, together with existing constructors such as Brabham choosing to build a Formula Ford chassis.\n\nAs the production Ford Cortina engine evolved to a new 1600cc crossflow unit, so did the Formula Ford regulations. Increasing costs forced them to relax the £1,000 price ceiling on Formula Ford as blueprinting of the engine was now allowed.\n\nBelgium hosted the first race outside England, in 1967. Formula Ford racing quickly spread across Europe and North America, with the first official Formula Ford race in the United States on March 23, 1969 and was included in the SCCA Runoffs that same year. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, Formula Ford had established itself as a direct path to a seat on a Formula One car, the highest level in open wheel motorsport. Australian Tim Schenken won over two dozen Formula Ford races in 1968, two years later he was driving a Formula One car for Frank Williams. Emerson Fittipaldi impressed during the 1970 Formula One Grand Prix season after a short stint in Formula Ford. In 1970, he became the first Formula Ford graduate to win a Formula One Grand Prix. In 1972, he became the first Formula Ford graduate to win the Formula One world championship.\n\nIn the United States, starting with a 1983 debut race and victory at the 1983 SCCA Runoffs the Swift DB-1 became the dominant chassis in North America Formula Ford racing with ten championships between 1983 and 1996. The DB-6 evolution of the chassis won an additional six championships through 2008. During this time Formula Ford was on the decline in the US for several reasons. The rising cost of competition, SCCA's introduction of a spec sports racer, Sports Renault, and the dominance of the Swift chassis helped to collapse the class in the US.\n\nCurrently, Formula Ford racing exists in two main forms in Europe: National Series for aspiring 'career' drivers run around the world which have used the 1600 Duratec engine, (which replaced the heavier but not significantly more powerful Zetec engine in 2006), and for 2012 are beginning to adopt the new EcoBoost 1600 turbo engine; and a mainly amateur, club-racing series attracting serious enthusiasts using the now elderly 1600 Kent engine with which the formula ran from the mid-1960s to mid-1990s. Whatever the engine of the Formula Ford car, it has long provided a relatively inexpensive way for drivers to race purpose-built racecars. There are many Formula Ford 1600 series for drivers of the older Kent-powered cars.\n\nA Formula Ford car is one of the more distinctive-looking open-wheel race cars because it does not have wings to create aerodynamic downforce. In order to reduce cost and allow smaller manufacturers to produce their own design of chassis without prohibitive tooling costs, chassis are steel space frame, unlike the monocoques found in other types of single seater racing.\n\nThe more popular marques were Van Diemen, Mygale and the Australian-built Spectrum, but smaller manufacturers such as Ray Race Cars and Vector have had some success. Historical designers who have made a mark on the series have included: Titan, Lotus, Merlyn, Hawke, Citation, Swift, Euroswift, Elden, Reynard, Crosslé, Lola, Zink, Bowin, Royale, and Cooper Racing.\n\nTop speeds in the National Class are easily as high as in the other junior formulae of BMW and Renault, but cornering speeds tend to be lower as Formula Ford cars lack the downforce-producing aerodynamic aids on the other cars; handling is therefore entirely down to mechanical grip, and the lack of wings ensures that cars following another are not aerodynamically disadvantaged, allowing some of the closest racing with plenty of overtaking. Series' rules may permit slick or treaded tires, generally supplied either by Dunlop or Avon. As the rules limit engine modifications, all cars are relatively equal and racing results tend to be close. Formula Fords allow suspension, damping, gearing and braking bias changes, but not aerodynamic options such as winged cars.\nIn 2012, new specifications and regulations were introduced, allowing the use of the new Ford EcoBoost engine along with improvements in chassis design. Unlike its predecessors, that used naturally aspirated engines and manual gearboxes, the EcoBoost car utilises power from a turbocharged engine and a sequential gearbox. The new car has 165PS, with identical engine calibration for every competitor's car. The chassis remains a steel spaceframe construction, with free chassis design open to all manufacturers. New to the car is its compliance with Formula Three safety standards, which involves mandatory crash structures, side-impact panels running the full height and length of the cockpit, an FIA-specified headrest and an extricable safety seat. In addition to the safety enhancements, some mandatory elements of bodywork shape have also been introduced. These will define the shape, size and orientation of the sidepod air intakes and the roll-hoop cover. By mandating these the frontal areas will be equalised between different manufacturers, removing the potential for significant aerodynamic advantage, making driving ability and the skills of engineers and designers in car set-up the major factors.\n\nIn the United States Formula Ford continues to use the earlier Ford Kent engines. For 2010 the Honda L15A7 engine used in the Honda Fit was introduced as an alternative engine. The Honda engine was developed in partnership with Quicksilver RacEngines with the intent of providing power similar to the existing Kent motor. Honda developed an install kit around the Swift DB-1 chassis. With the introduction of the Honda motor SCCA changed the class name from Formula Ford to Formula F.\n\nChampionships for Formula Fords are run in many countries around the world. The major series is the British Formula Ford Championship, however there are many other thriving series. Each run to essentially the same rules and regulations, with minor variations for local conditions.\n\nThe British series is the main Formula Ford championship in the world . Created in 1976, the championship has run to all four generations of regulations and specifications. In 2013, the series adopted the Formula Ford EcoBoost 200 specification, which include an increase in the EcoBoost engine's power, along with the addition of a fully adjustable aerodynamic package which includes front and rear wings previously never used in the British championship. Another change for the 2013 season was Duratec class cars being ineligible for the championship, leaving only the EcoBoost class. The series also moved back to supporting the BTCC. In the 2015 the championship was renamed MSA Formula. In 2016, it was rebranded as F4 British Championship.\n\nSeveral former drivers of the British championship have become successful in Formula One, including Eddie Irvine and Anthony Davidson, while Formula Ford champions Ayrton Senna and Jenson Button also went on to win the Formula One Drivers' Championship.\n\nFor many years the highlight of the Formula Ford season was the Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch, England. Entries of several hundred cars from all over the Formula Ford world were common into the 1990s, with racers competing in knockout heats to decide the grid for a grand final. Entries later declined, and later festivals struggled to attract more than 40-50 cars, enough for two heats and a final. More \"historic\" FF1600 cars had been turning up for the supporting races than contemporary Zetecs, however in 2006 the Festival saw the Duratec engine for the first time thereby having a final for all three marques at one meeting for the first time. The Walter Hayes Trophy now recognises the continuing interest in 1600cc 'Kent' Formula Ford and attracted over 150 entries in 2006, including several drivers who more commonly compete in much more senior formulae.\n\nThe Formula Ford EuroCup, known originally as the \"European Formula Ford Championship\", is the current incarnation of a pan-European championship for Formula Ford competitors, last held previously in 2001. The 2011 series was aimed at giving drivers experience at European race circuits. Three national Formula Ford championships are involved in the revived championship, these being the British, Benelux and Scandinavian championships. While individual events nominate a winner, there is no overarching point score to declare a series champion.\n\nThe Australian Formula Ford Series is an Australian motor racing competition for Formula Ford racing cars. It has been held annually since 1970, originally as a national series and from 1993 to 2013 as the Australian Formula Ford Championship. The control engine was changed from the first-generation Kent engine to the third-generation Mazda-sourced Ford Duratec engine in 2006. In 2014 the championship was downgraded to a national series with Duratec-engined cars and Kent-engined cars both eligible to compete alongside each other. Currently, the winner wins a ticket to a scouting combine for INDYCAR at the end of the calendar year.\n\nThe U.S. F2000 National Championship powered by Mazda is an American racing series using the American variation of the Formula Ford formula, Formula Ford 2000, that resumed operation for the 2010 season. It is sanctioned by IndyCar, and is a part of The Mazda Road to Indy.\n\nThe F1600 Championship Series was created by the SCCA in 2011. The series is organized by Formula Race Promotions, the same organization which organizes the F2000 Championship Series. The class operates under the same rules as the SCCA Formula F. Therefore, many drivers from the local club racing scene make their appearance in the national series.\n\nThe Southern Formula 1600 Championship was created by Right Turn Promotions and Primus Racing Parts for 2018. The series races on SCCA event weekends, alongside the Southern Formula 2000 Championship. The class operates under the same rules as the SCCA Formula F. Racing at traditional road race tracks in the southern United States, the series attracts drivers from across all forms of club and pro racing.\n\nThe SCCA National Championship Runoffs is the end-of-year championship race meeting for Sports Car Club of America Club Racing competitors. Divisional champions and other top drivers from the SCCA's 116 regions are invited to participate at the Runoffs. National championships are awarded to the winners of each class. Formula Ford (now Formula F) was first included in the Runoffs in 1969.\n\nFord Motorsport administers some of the national Formula Ford championships around the world, and continue to control the technical regulations for all cars globally. The older Kent-engined cars are very popular with club racers, providing the ground for several organizations to run their own series. Many racing schools offer driver training in Formula Ford cars. However, in many countries, Formula BMW and Formula Renault Campus had superseded Formula Ford as the main entry level class in the mid-2000s; the demise of Formula BMW in Europe after only a few years of operation caused somewhat of a resurgence in support for the Ford grids. In the UK there are many club-level regional series aimed at the amateur enthusiast, as well as championships for older Fords. So popular is the Kent engine around the world that Ford Motorsport recently restarted a limited production of the increasingly hard to source engine blocks: for a major motor manufacturer to restart output of a 40-year-old design just shows how well-established the formula still is.\n\nFormula Ford has given birth to several other categories of racing: Formula Ford 2000 evolved in the 1970s to use a Pinto engine and, although it used basically Formula Ford chassis, permitted use of slicks and wings; it was seen as a natural step up from the 1600cc formula and a stepping stone to categories such as Formula Three. Formula Ford 2000 engines and transmissions were married to sports-racing chassis to produce Sports 2000.\n\nOlder Formula Fords, with outboard shock absorbers, race in the United States as Club Formula Fords in SCCA and other club racing series.\n\nFormula 100 was an unsuccessful attempt in the late 1960s to create a sportscar category related to Formula Ford but using a 1300 cc Ford engine; the cars were heavy and slow. The proposed Formula Turbo Ford, an attempt to update FF2000, of the mid-1980s was limited to one Reynard that ran a few demonstration laps.\n\nFormula Ford remains popular in its 1600 cc form—the cars are widely raced, sprinted and hillclimbed. Formula Continental is also a popular choice in the USA and Canada.

Its first performance was in Prague at the Czech National Opera on 27 April 1927; and the first German production followed (in the translation by Max Brod as Schwanda der Dudelsackpfeifer), at Breslau on 16 December 1928. After that success, German-language productions proliferated around the world, with over 2000 performances taking place during the next decade. Aside from those in Germany and Austria, these included:\n\nAt the time the opera, with its occasional use of Czech folk material, enjoyed considerable success, with translations into 17 languages. The opera fell from the repertory when the composer's music was banned by the Nazi regimes of Austria and Germany during the late 1930s; and although it is still revived occasionally, orchestral performances of the \"\"Polka and Fugue\"\" drawn from the opera are more regularly heard in concert and on record.\n\nIt has been a week since Švanda and Dorota married. The robber Babinský takes refuge in their farmhouse, and immediately falls for Dorota. Babinský quickly convinces Švanda of the tedium of married life, and persuades him to go off on an adventure. They arrive at the Queen's court, where she is under the power of a wicked Magician. The Queen had made a deal with the Magician where she consented to the death of the Prince, her betrothed, in exchange for a heart of ice (and thus no human feeling) and a diamond scepter, symbolic of her power. Švanda plays his bagpipes, which breaks the spell. The Queen then offers herself to Švanda in marriage. Švanda accepts, kissing her, but then Dorota appears, which angers the Queen. The Queen, her heart now again of ice, has Švanda and Dorota imprisoned and Švanda condemned to death.\n\nBabinský helps save Švanda by replacing the executioner's axe with a broom. Švanda plays his bagpipes again, enchanting the crowd gathered for the execution, and escapes with Dorota. Dorota herself is now angry at Švanda and questions his fidelity. Švanda retorts that if he ever kissed the Queen, may he go to Hell. Forgetting that he did kiss the Queen, Švanda immediately drops through the earth into Hell. Babinský then tells Dorota that he loves her, but she makes him promise to rescue Švanda.\n\nIn Hell, the Devil asks Švanda to play for him, since he has nothing to do, because no one will play cards with the Devil because he always cheats. Švanda at first refuses, but then Babinský appears and challenges the Devil to a card game. By cheating even more than the Devil, Babinský wins the game and rescues Švanda. (It is at this point that Švanda plays the music that forms the famous \"Fugue\".) At the end, Švanda and Dorota are reconciled, and Babinský sorrowfully leaves, in search of new adventures.\n\n\n"}

Three parties are concerned with this act - the party who had incurred the obligation to perform under the contract is called the \"delegator\"; the party who assumes the responsibility of performing this duty is called the \"delegatee\"; and the party to whom this performance is owed is called the \"obligee\".\n\nA delegation will be null and void if it poses any threat to the commercially reasonable expectations of the obligee. For example, a task requiring specialized skills or based on the unique characteristics of the promisee can not be delegated. If a specific celebrity was hired to make a speech, they could not delegate the task to another person, even if the other person would give the same speech, word for word. However, a delegation of performance that does not pose such a threat will be held to be valid. In such a case, the obligee will be under an affirmative duty to cooperate with the delegatee to the extent necessary for the fulfillment of the delegator's obligations\n\nIf the delegatee fails to perform satisfactorily, the obligee may elect to treat this failure as a breach of the original contract by the delegator \"or\" may assert himself as a third party beneficiary of the contract between the delegator and the delegatee, and can claim all remedies due to a third party beneficiary.\n\nIf the delegation is without consideration, the delegator remains liable for nonperformance, while the delegatee will not be liable to anyone for anything. Unlike an assignment, a delegation is virtually always for consideration, and never donative - few people are going to accept the charitable offer to perform a task contracted to someone else.\n\nA parallel concept to delegation is assignment, which occurs when one party transfers his present rights to receive the benefits accruing to the assignor under that contract. A delegation and an assignment can be accomplished at the same time, although the right to sue for nonpayment always stays with delegator. Under the common law, a contract clause prohibiting assignment also prohibits delegation. Another common law rule requires that a party to a contract can not delegate performance that involves special skills or reputation (although it is possible to have a novation under such circumstances).\n\nIn Administrative Law (the law that controls government action and decisions) a delegation is the process of handing some administrative action or decision to a subordinate. It is achieved through two mechanisms:\n\n\n\n"}

He also represented England between 2011 and 2014. He made his first-class debut in 2003 and won the NBC Denis Compton Award in 2004 and 2009.\n\nBorn in South Africa and initially schooled at St John's College, Johannesburg, he moved to England at the age of 14 and gained British citizenship, making him eligible for the England cricket team. After impressing for the England Lions in the West Indies in the early part of 2011, he was called up to the senior team as a replacement for Ajmal Shahzad for the knock out stages of the 2011 Cricket World Cup and made his Twenty20 and ODI debuts later that year against Sri Lanka.\n\nDerek Pringle described him in \"The Daily Telegraph\" as a fast bowler who is capable of obtaining conventional and reverse swing, as well as of deceiving the batsman by bowling a variety of slower balls.\n\nDernbach was born in Johannesburg, South Africa to a South African father and an Italian mother and has used an Italian passport. He moved with his family to England in 2000 when he was 14. In South Africa, his preferred sport was rugby union, but he began to develop as a cricketer in England. After bowling at an under-15s net session at Surrey, he quickly moved through the age groups.\n\nAlthough born in South Africa, after his first call-up to the England squad, he stated that \"I don't owe anything to South Africa. I was just born there, did a bit of schooling there, my whole cricket career has been based in the UK, and UK is my home. I want to give everything I can to England cricket, that's the country I love and that's the country that has given me everything I have now.\"\n\nIn 2013, Dernbach became the first UK-based athlete to pose for a PETA \"Ink Not Mink\" advertisement, showing off his arm and chest tattoos on behalf of the anti-fur campaign.\n\nHis consistency and regular wicket-taking for Surrey was rewarded with a place on the 2011 England Lions tour to the West Indies, before a late call-up to England’s 2011 World Cup squad made him the first Surrey youth academy graduate to secure recognition at this level. He continued to perform well for Surrey whenever available. His 2011 season was capped with a Man of the Match performance in the CB40 Final, where his 4/30 helped lift Surrey to victory.\n\nDernbach was effective in Surrey’s successful T20 campaign in 2013, and was the side's leading wicket taker with 18 wickets (at an average of 16.44) as Surrey reached the Finals Day at Edgbaston for the first time since 2006.\n\nIn 2010, Dernbach was selected for the England Performance Programme tour of Australia and subsequent England Lions tour of the West Indies where they participated in the domestic Regional Four Day Competition. In the latter, he took 19 wickets at an average of 15.63, making him the leading English bowler.\n\nHe was called up to the senior team as a replacement for Ajmal Shahzad for the knock out stages of the 2011 Cricket World Cup but was not picked to play.\n\nAt the beginning of the English season, he was then picked for the Lions to face the touring Sri Lankans. He took 9 wickets in the match, although the Lions ultimately lost the match. However his performance saw him included in the senior squad for the second Test after an injury to James Anderson. He had to wait until the limited overs games to make his debut; taking 1–18 in his first Twenty20 International and 2–25 in his first ODI.\n\nDernbach was a member of the England ODI squad for their match against Ireland in August 2011.\n\nHe has gone on to make 24 appearances for the ODI and 34 for the England t20 side.\n\nIn the 2012 ICC World T20, he and Steven Finn equalled the tournament record for the highest 10th wicket partnership.\n\nHe was also named in the T20I XI by Cricinfo for his performances in 2013.\n\nAt the time of his final international appearance to date, Dernbach had the worst career economy rate in both ODIs (bowlers bowling more than 1000 balls) and T20Is (bowlers bowling more than 500 balls).

Before independence from Portugal in 1975, Xai-Xai was known as João Belo, in the Overseas Province of Mozambique. João Belo grew and developed under Portuguese rule as a port, agricultural and industrial centre (rice and cashew were harvested and processed), a provider of services, including a district hospital and banking, and an administrative centre.

A few blocks from the central market, there is an open-air furniture factory, located underneath several cashew trees. The beach of Praia do Xai-Xai, approximately 12 km from Xai-Xai, has been a popular tourist attraction since Mozambican tourism, originally under Portuguese administration, was first developed before 1975. A coral reef running parallel to the shore offers good snorkeling and protects the beach from strong waves. In addition, the Wenela Tidal Pool, south of the town, includes a natural tunnel and blow hole that links the pool to the Indian Ocean. \nRight on Praia de Xai Xai Beach there is a giant rock pool that forms at medium and low tides that is up to 200 metres long, forming a giant safe pool for families and swimmers.\n\nXai Xai was served by the gauge Gaza Railway, which went to the city of Manjacaze and beyond. It lies on the EN1 road which connects with the roads from the Namaacha and Ressano Garcia borders.

{"id": "2022272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022272", "title": "Jahbulon", "text": "Jahbulon\n\nJahbulon or Jabulon () is a word which is allegedly used in some rituals of Royal Arch Masonry, and derivations thereof.\n\nNon-Masonic authors have alleged that it is a Masonic name for God, and even the name of a unique \"Masonic god\", despite repeated statements by Freemasonry's officials that \"There is no separate Masonic God\", nor a separate proper name for a deity in any branch of Freemasonry. It is this interpretation of a \"Masonic god\" that has led to debates about and condemnation of Freemasonry by several religious groups. In England, no ritual containing the name has been in official Masonic use since February 1989.\n\nAccording to Masonic historian Arturo de Hoyos, the word Jahbulon was first used in the 18th century in early French versions of the Royal Arch degree. It relates a Masonic allegory in which Jabulon was the name of an explorer living during the time of Solomon who discovered the ruins of an ancient temple. Within the ruins he found a gold plate upon which the name of God (YHWH) was engraved.\n\nIn \"Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor\", published in the mid-19th century, Malcolm Duncan uses the word as a recognition password in his rendition of the Royal Arch degree, and in a footnote states that the word is a combination of sacred names. However, there has been controversy regarding Duncan's ritual. According to Turnbull, Everett and Denslow, Duncan has the candidate swear: \"I furthermore promise and swear, that I will support the Constitution of the General Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the United States of America...\" whereas the General Grand Chapter at the time styled itself: \"General Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of the United States, a subtle but significant difference. Some Masonic authors state that even if Duncan's ritual is authentic, it is either an outdated exposure or that it had been superseded by another explanation.\n\nAccording to Francis X. King in \"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.\", the word is used in two rituals of the Ordo Templi Orientis: \"the Lodge of Perfection\", in which the candidate receives the Fourth Degree (which is called \"Perfect Magician and Companion of the Holy Royal Arch of Enoch\"); and the \"Perfect Initiate\" (or \"Prince of Jerusalem\") degree, which falls between the fourth and fifth degrees. King prints in his book the lyrics of a song that mentions the word \"Jahbulon.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that the Rastafari word for God, Jah, comes from the term Jahbulon, although the name JAH (a transliteration of YAH, shortened from Yahweh) appears in the King James Version of the Bible, in Psalm 68:4. The term \"Jah\" also appears throughout the Psalms in other Bible translations, for instance the Darby translation or Young's Literal translation. William David Spencer, in his 1999 \"Dread Jesus\", proposes that Archibald Dunkley and Joseph Nathaniel Hibbert were among the preachers that inspired the Rastafari movement, and that both were members of the \"Ancient Mystic Order of Ethiopia\", a fraternal order derived from Prince Hall Freemasonry. Spencer believes that several features of the Rastafari movement derive from this lodge, including the name \"Jah\", from the word \"Jah-Bul-On\".\n\nAccording to The Rev. Canon Richard Tydeman, in an address to the Supreme Grand Chapter of England on 13 November 1985, the word is a compound of three Hebrew terms:\n\nAccording to Walton Hannah, the word is a compound of the names of three gods worshipped in the ancient Middle East. \n\nMuch of the available material that discusses the word \"Jahbulon\" does not address the administrative and jurisdictional distinctions amongst the appendant bodies of Freemasonry. Royal Arch Masonry is an appendant body to Freemasonry. In some areas it forms part of the York Rite, and in others it is an independent body. To be eligible to join one must first be a Master Mason. The administration of the Royal Arch is entirely separate from the administration of Craft Freemasonry. Every Masonic organization is sovereign only in its own jurisdiction, and has no authority in any other jurisdiction. This means that there is no standardization whatsoever with regards to words, signs, grips, or any other Masonic \"secrets\".\n\n\n"}

He then retired in the second round of the Shanghai Rolex Masters against Fognini due to a wrist injury; the injury ended his season. Robredo ended the year as the world no. 18. Robredo was named the Spanish Tennis Writers Association player of the year.\n\nRobredo reached the fourth round of the Australian Open, losing a close match to eventual champion Stanislas Wawrinka.\n\nRobredo is a baseline player, who can play both offensively and defensively. He is known for his versatility and solid groundstrokes on both wings. Robredo's baseline play is exceptional, and is considered one of the most consistent and dangerous baseliners on the tour. Like most traditional Spanish players like Rafael Nadal, Robredo puts a very high amount of topspin on both his forehand and single-handed backhand. This makes his groundstrokes both consistent and penetrating at the same time. His backhand is also considered one of the best single-handed backhands on the tour, being very powerful and clutch during important points. However, his slice is weaker than most one-handers'. Mainly playing from the baseline, Robredo uses his solid groundstrokes to dictate points by moving opponents around and forcing weak replies. Due to the top-spin on his groundstrokes, Robredo has an edge against one-handed backhand players, who might find it hard to return high balls to their backhand. Because of this, he has sometimes been accused of being a \"moonballer\".\n\nRobredo is also versatile in his baseline play. Due to the penetrating nature of his groundstrokes, he can effectively control points and force weak returns from his opponents, finishing points quickly. However, he can also counter-punch, the height of his balls giving him enough time to recover and preventing opponents from capitalising on weak returns. Robredo usually only flattens out his groundstrokes more when hitting weak returns from opponents, and even then they are not completely flat and still have a substantial amount of topspin.\n\nRobredo's first serve is not considered his weapon due to its lack of any significant pace, but it is not weak to the point that opponents can capitalise on it. He employs a high amount of top-spin for his second serve, making it slow but pushing his opponents further back, preventing his opponents from hitting return aces.\n\nHowever, Robredo's main weaknesses is his over-defensiveness. At times, even though he has gained a significant advantage through his groundstrokes, Robredo does not make an effort to end off the point cleanly by hitting a clean winner or by coming up to the net to volley. Instead, he usually stays around the baseline, not capitalising on the advantage he has. This makes him especially vulnerable against clutch players who can make use of their opponents' speed or direction to turn the point around, such as Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic.\n\nRobredo is named after the rock opera \"Tommy\" by The Who, of which his father is a big fan.\n\nRobredo is currently sponsored by Erke for his sportswear, Asics for his shoes, Dunlop Sport for his tennis racquets, TW Steel watches, Smeg, and the Ukrainian Food Company.\n\nRobredo's childhood tennis idol was Stefan Edberg, along with John McEnroe, Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, and various Spanish tennis players. He cites Arantxa Sánchez (with whom he won the 2002 Hopman Cup for Spain) as his favorite female player among retired players; among recently active players his favorite male and female players are Roger Federer and Justine Henin.\n\nSome fans refer to Robredo as \"Disco Tommy\" for the long, wavy hairstyle he began cultivating during the 2006 tennis season; after Robredo mentioned that he calls his coach \"President Palmer\" while his coach calls him \"Jack Bauer\" (from \"24\"), fans also began referring to him as \"Disco Jack.\"\n\n2007 marked increased media exposure for Robredo. He was recognized by the Spanish editions of \"Men's Health\" and \"Marie Claire\", as well as \"People en Español\".\n\n\"Current through to the 2019 US Open.\"\n"}

Bart, wanting to raise her spirits, decides to nominate her for the Teacher of the Year Award. Edna and the Simpsons are flown to Orlando, Florida, for the event.\n\nEdna Krabappel tells her students to write a paper on World War I, due in three weeks. After class, Edna and Principal Skinner's apple picking date is cancelled when Skinner's mother, Agnes, interrupts. Bart continuously gets distracted from writing his paper by pranks and other activities, and at the end of the three weeks, he still has not started the assignment. The day before the date of submission, he asks Grampa for help, relying on his recount of World War I. Edna rejects Bart's paper for using 6 pages of ads as filler and tells him that he will have to do it correctly after school. As Bart finishes the assignment after school, supervised by Edna herself, he observes Skinner cancel a movie date with Edna when Agnes calls. Bart consoles Edna, and she reluctantly accepts his offer to accompany her to a documentary at the movie theater.\n\nAt home, Lisa suggests that Bart nominate Edna for the Teacher of the Year Award.

Bart informs his family that, as nominator, he and his family are going to Orlando, Florida.\n\nAt Springfield Elementary, Skinner is despondent at the thought that Edna could leave the school. Groundskeeper Willie lends Skinner his sports car so he can go to Orlando, where he surprises Edna with a kiss under the fireworks display.

Also, unlike waveguide, microstrip is not enclosed, and is therefore susceptible to cross-talk and unintentional radiation.\n\nFor lowest cost, microstrip devices may be built on an ordinary FR-4 (standard PCB) substrate. However it is often found that the dielectric losses in FR4 are too high at microwave frequencies, and that the dielectric constant is not sufficiently tightly controlled. For these reasons, an alumina substrate is commonly used.\n\nOn a smaller scale, microstrip transmission lines are also built into monolithic microwave integrated circuits.\n\nMicrostrip lines are also used in high-speed digital PCB designs, where signals need to be routed from one part of the assembly to another with minimal distortion, and avoiding high cross-talk and radiation.\n\nMicrostrip is one of many forms of planar transmission line, others include stripline and coplanar waveguide, and it is possible to integrate all of these on the same substrate.\n\nA differential microstrip—a balanced signal pair of microstrip lines—is often used for high-speed signals such as DDR2 SDRAM clocks, USB Hi-Speed data lines, PCI Express data lines, LVDS data lines, etc., often all on the same PCB. Most PCB design tools support such differential pairs.\n\nThe electromagnetic wave carried by a microstrip line exists partly in the dielectric substrate, and partly in the air above it. In general, the dielectric constant of the substrate will be different (and greater) than that of the air, so that the wave is travelling in an inhomogeneous medium. In consequence, the propagation velocity is somewhere between the speed of radio waves in the substrate, and the speed of radio waves in air. This behaviour is commonly described by stating the effective dielectric constant (or effective relative permittivity) of the microstrip; this being the dielectric constant of an equivalent homogeneous medium (i.e., one resulting in the same propagation velocity).\n\nFurther consequences of an inhomogeneous medium include:\n\n\nA closed-form approximate expression for the quasi-static characteristic impedance of a microstrip line was developed by Wheeler:\n\nwhere formula_2 is the \"effective width\", which is the actual width of the strip, plus a correction to account for the non-zero thickness of the metallization:\n\nHere \"Z\" is the impedance of free space, \"ε\" is the relative permittivity of substrate, \"w\" is the width of the strip, \"h\" is the thickness (\"height\") of substrate, and \"t\" is the thickness of the strip metallization.\n\nThis formula is asymptotic to an exact solution in three different cases\n\n\nIt is claimed that for most other cases, the error in impedance is less than 1%, and is always less than 2%. By covering all aspect-ratios in one formula, Wheeler 1977 improves on Wheeler 1965 which gives one formula for formula_10 and another for formula_11 (thus introducing a discontinuity in the result at formula_12).\n\nCuriously, Harold Wheeler disliked both the terms 'microstrip' and 'characteristic impedance', and avoided using them in his papers.\n\nA number of other approximate formulae for the characteristic impedance have been advanced by other authors. However, most of these are applicable to only a limited range of aspect-ratios, or else cover the entire range piecewise.\n\nIn particular, the set of equations proposed by Hammerstad, who modifies on Wheeler, are perhaps the most often cited:\n\nwhere formula_14 is the effective dielectric constant, approximated as:\n\nIn order to build a complete circuit in microstrip, it is often necessary for the path of a strip to turn through a large angle. An abrupt 90° bend in a microstrip will cause a significant portion of the signal on the strip to be reflected back towards its source, with only part of the signal transmitted on around the bend. One means of effecting a low-reflection bend, is to curve the path of the strip in an arc of radius at least 3 times the strip-width. However, a far more common technique, and one which consumes a smaller area of substrate, is to use a mitred bend.\n\nThe optimum mitre for a wide range of microstrip geometries has been determined experimentally by Douville and James. They find that a good fit for the optimum percentage mitre is given by\n\nsubject to formula_17 and with the substrate dielectric constant formula_18. This formula is entirely independent of formula_5. The actual range of parameters for which Douville and James present evidence is formula_20 and formula_21. They report a VSWR of better than 1.1 (i.e., a return loss better than −26 dB) for any percentage mitre within 4% (of the original formula_22) of that given by the formula. At the minimum formula_23 of 0.25, the percentage mitre is 98.4%, so that the strip is very nearly cut through.\n\nFor both the curved and mitred bends, the electrical length is somewhat shorter than the physical path-length of the strip.\n\n\n"}

The innovative gold and silver frame, created by Philip Liebart of Rundell, Bridge & Rundell, had been designed to be almost invisible underneath the diamonds. A plan to remove the traditional fleurs-de-lis and introduce the rose, thistle and shamrock, the floral emblems of England, Scotland and Ireland, was abandoned following objections by the College of Heralds. As a general rule, the maintenance caps in British crowns are made of crimson or purple velvet, but this crown differed in having a dark blue cap.\n\nBecause of the postponement of George IV's coronation due to the trial of his wife, Queen Caroline, the final bill for the hiring of the stones came to £24,425. After his coronation, the king was reluctant to part with his new crown, and lobbied the government to buy it outright so he could use it for the annual State Opening of Parliament, but it was too expensive. The crown was dismantled in 1823 and has not been worn by any other monarch since then.\n\nHe did purchase a bronze life-sized model of his crown for £38, on which the inscription reads: \"Cast of the Rich Imperial Diamond Crown with which His Most Sacred Majesty King George IV was crowned on 19 July 1821\".\n\nEmptied of its jewels and discarded by the royal family, the crown was loaned to the Museum of London by the Amherst family from 1933 until 1985. It was purchased by Asprey in 1987 and later acquired by Jefri Bolkiah, Prince of Brunei, who presented it to the United Kingdom. It had been valued at £376,000 in 1995 for the purposes of an application to export the crown to the United States. The application was withdrawn during a review by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art. It is part of the Royal Collection and has been on public display in the Martin Tower at the Tower of London since 1996. Diamonds worth £2 million on loan from De Beers are displayed next to the crown to give visitors an idea of how it looked originally.\n\n"}

{"id": "2022371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022371", "title": "Griffin (The Invisible Man)", "text": "Griffin (The Invisible Man)\n\nGriffin, also known as the Invisible Man, is a fictional character who first appeared as the titular protagonist of H. G. Wells' 1897 science fiction novel \"The Invisible Man\". In the original work, Griffin is a scientist whose research in optics and experiments into changing the human body's refractive index to that of air results in him becoming invisible. After becoming invisible, he wraps his head in bandages and dons a pair of goggles or glasses in order to enable others to see him. Unable to reverse the invisibility process, he descends into insanity and becomes a criminal.\n\nThe character and variations thereof has been featured in various media, including films, television series and merchandise. The most famous non-literary incarnation of Griffin is portrayed by Claude Rains in the 1933 film \"The Invisible Man\", distributed by Universal Pictures. The film spawned a number of sequels that feature different invisible characters. Griffin and the 1933 film have become iconic in popular culture, particularly in regards to horror fiction. An adaptation of the original novella and remake of the original film, again titled \"The Invisible Man\", was released in 2020.\n\nGriffin is a brilliant research scientist who discovers a formula for making a human being invisible. The formula entails taking opium and another drug, which makes his blood boil, then processing his body in a radiator engine. He succeeds, but he finds himself unable to reverse the process. Unlike the character in the 1933 film, the Griffin of the novel is possibly a psychopath or sociopath even before he makes himself invisible.\n\nGriffin is a gifted young medical student with albinism who studies optical density. He believes that he is on the verge of a great scientific discovery, but feels uncomfortable working under his professor named Hobbema (whom he calls a \"thief of ideas\"). To ensure that he gets sole credit for the discovery, he leaves university and moves to a dingy apartment to continue his experiments alone.\n\nTo finance his experiments, Griffin robs his own father, which drives the father to commit suicide (because the money had not even been his own). Working as a recluse in his flat, Griffin invents a formula to bend light and decrease the refractive index of physical objects, making them invisible. He intends from the start to perform the process on the neighbours' cat and then on himself, but is forced to rush his experiments due to persistent intrusion from his landlord, who is suspicious of his activities and considers him to be a vivisectionist. He processes himself to hide from his landlord, and sets fire to the building to cover his tracks. He winds up alone, wandering invisible and naked through the streets of London, struggling to survive out in the open, unseen by those around him.\n\nTo make himself visible again, Griffin steals some clothes from a dingy backstreet theatre shop, including a trench-coat and hat. He wraps his head in bandages to conceal his invisibility, covering his eyes with large dark goggles. He takes up residence in the \"Coach and Horses\" Inn in the village of Iping, so he can reverse his experiment in a quiet environment, but complications arise with locals unnerved by his appearance (particularly Teddy Henfrey, the clock-jobber who considered him to be a criminal evading persecution and Mr. Cuss, who first encounters his invisibility). As a result, his progress slows and he has insufficient money to satisfy the inn owner, Mrs. Hall. To pay the bill, Griffin burgles the home of Reverend Bunting. The police pursue him, and in a fit of frustrated anger, he reveals his invisibility by throwing off his clothes and escaping.\n\nNow driven insane by his inability to reverse the experiment, Griffin seeks assistance from a tramp named Thomas Marvel. He has Marvel carry money for him, but Marvel runs away with the money. Griffin pursues him to the town of Port Burdock, where he runs into his old schoolmate Dr. Kemp. Still bitter and angry towards the rest of humanity, Griffin attempts to convince Kemp to be his visible partner and help him begin a \"reign of terror\". Kemp, rather than assisting the crazed Invisible Man, alerts Colonel Adye of the Port Burdock police. Furious, Griffin vows to kill Kemp, but is forced to flee. Kemp rallies the people of Port Burdock, who find and overcome Griffin when he attempts a one-man siege on Kemp's house. Griffin is surrounded and savagely beaten by navvies. His last words are \"Mercy! Mercy!\", prompting Kemp to call off the mob and administer first aid, though it is too late. Griffin dies, becoming visible again, revealing a brutally battered corpse.\n\nIn the 1933 film \"The Invisible Man\", Griffin's first name is \"Jack\" (the novel never reveals his first name). He was played by Claude Rains.\n\nJack Griffin works for Dr. Cranley, assisting him in food preservation experiments alongside his friend Dr. Arthur Kemp. Griffin is deeply in love with Cranley's daughter, Flora, and the two plan to marry, but Griffin is poor and thus afraid he has nothing to offer her. He begins experimenting with an obscure and dangerous drug called monocane, hoping his work will make him rich and famous—and a worthwhile husband for Flora. Griffin discovers a combination of monocane and other chemicals that makes a person invisible. Too excited by his discovery to think clearly, Griffin leaves Kemp and the Cranleys to complete the experiment in solitude. He injects himself with the formula over the course of a month and becomes invisible. Only after he is invisible does he realize that he does not know how to reverse the process. Panicking, Griffin goes to the village of Iping and rents a room in the Lion's Head Inn, where he begins searching for a formula to reverse the invisibility. He makes himself appear visible by wrapping his head in bandages and wearing dark goggles. Curious locals, the maddening side effects of monocane, and frustration from multiple failed tests drive Griffin insane. After he assaults Jenny Hall and severely injures her husband, Herbert, Griffin is confronted by the police, but sheds his clothing to be invisible and eludes them. He seeks help from Kemp, but the monocane has so affected his mind that he succumbs to megalomania and plans world domination with \"invisible armies\". He wants to make Kemp his visible partner and assistant. Not even a visit from Flora and her father helps ease Griffin's increasing insanity. He vows to kill Kemp after his old friend alerts Inspector Lane to his whereabouts and despite intensive police protection surrounding Kemp, Griffin eventually makes good on his threats. After killing Kemp by tying him up in his car and sending it over a cliff, he seeks refuge from the cold in a farmer's barn. The farmer summons police, who set fire to the barn. As Griffin flees the burning barn, the Chief of detectives, who can see his footprints in the snow, shoots at him, the shot passing through both of his lungs. Griffin dies from the gunshot wounds in the hospital. During this, the effects of the monocane begin to wear off and Griffin returns to sanity, apologizing for his crimes by saying \"I meddled in things that man must leave alone\". The invisibility also wears off in death and Griffin's body becomes visible again.\n\nThe film portrays Griffin more sympathetically than the novel. The novel's Griffin is callous and cruel from the beginning and only pursues the experiment for wealth and his ego. The movie shows Griffin as an honourable man who is misguided. His insanity is purely a side-effect of the invisibility drug and his motivation for the experiment was a misguided desire to do good for science and mankind, born primarily out of his love for his fiancée.\n\n\nJohnny Depp was to portray the Invisible Man as part of Universal's Dark Universe, a shared cinematic universe based on the classic Universal Monsters. It was uncertain if the character would be Dr. Griffin or a very different character. But on November 8, 2017, producers Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan moved on to other projects, leaving the future of the \"Dark Universe\" in doubt. In January 2019, Universal announced that the plan moving forward was to focus on filmmaker-driven films, and less of an interconnection in the Dark Universe. Ultimately, Elisabeth Moss was given a starring role in the film as Cecilia Kass, while Oliver Jackson-Cohen and Michael Dorman were respectively cast as Adrian Griffin and Tom Griffin. \"The Invisible Man\" re-entered development, written and directed by Leigh Whannell and produced by Jason Blum. Johnny Depp still had option to star in the lead role, though all parties ultimately passed. \"The Invisible Man\" was released on February 28, 2020, receiving positive reviews.\n\nIn this version, Adrian Griffin is a scientist billionaire and pioneer in the field of optics, who fakes his death and becomes invisible to torment his ex-girlfriend Cecilia, whom he constantly abused. Unlike the novel and 1933 film, the invisibility is achieved through a suit fixed with hundreds of micro-cameras instead of an invisibility formula. When Adrian's brother Tom was found in the invisibility suit, Adrian used him as a scapegoat claiming to Cecilia that he was holding him prisoner. In an attempt to get Adrian to confess, she meets him at his house to discuss her pregnancy while James listens in on a wire. Adrian insists that he had actually been kidnapped, claiming that his experience has changed his outlook on life and their relationship. Cecilia departs to use the restroom. Moments later, the room's security camera captures Adrian seemingly committing suicide by slicing his throat. Cecilia emerges from the bathroom and \"frantically\" calls the police. Off-camera, she taunts him to reveal that she had retrieved the earlier-hidden second invisibility suit to kill Adrian, regardless of whether he was the invisible figure. When Detective James Lanier arrives and asks what happened, she confirms what the camera saw. He spots the invisibility suit in her bag, but accepts her story and allows her to leave.\n\nThe Invisible Man appears in \"Mad Monster Party?\" voiced by Allen Swift, impersonating Claude Rains. This depiction of the Invisible Man is shown to wear a fez, dark glasses and a purple dressing gown. He is among the monsters invited by Baron Boris von Frankenstein to attend his meeting at his castle on the Isle of Evil in the Caribbean Sea. A pie thrown into his face reveals that he has an enormous nose and is extremely ugly.\n\nThe Invisible Man appears in \"Mad Mad Mad Monsters\" (a \"prequel of sorts\" to \"Mad Monster Party?\") voiced again by Allen Swift. This version goes by the name of Claude. He, his invisible wife Nagatha, and their invisible boy Ghoul and his invisible dog Goblin are invited by Baron Henry von Frankenstein to attend the wedding of Frankenstein's Monster and the Monster's Bride at the Transylvania-Astoria Hotel on the midnight of Friday the 13th.\n\nIn Genndy Tartakovsky's 2012 Sony Pictures Animation film \"Hotel Transylvania\", Griffin the Invisible Man (voiced by David Spade) is one of the supporting character monsters who checks into Hotel Transylvania, and is among Count Dracula's (Adam Sandler) circle of friends. This version is completely invisible, and his glasses are the only thing that can be seen in the movie. He is more outwardly, heroic and laid-back than his previous incarnations, which portray him as an aggressive, power-hungry psychopath. In one scene, Dracula makes a disparaging remark about people with red curly hair, and Griffin takes offense to this, saying that he has red curly hair.\n\nDavid Spade reprised his role as Griffin, the Invisible Man, in the 2015 sequel \"Hotel Transylvania 2\". He unsuccessfully tries to make his friends think he has an invisible girlfriend (and finds one in the end). Spade reprised the role again in the 2018 film \"\".\n\nJohn Hurt voiced Griffin in the Big Finish Productions adaptation, released shortly after Hurt's death in 2017.\n\nIn Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's comic book series, \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\", Hawley Griffin is depicted as a member of the Victorian-era team of agents for which the series is named. Griffin is given the first name \"Hawley\" in the title (as a reference to Hawley Crippen), and it is explained that the Invisible Man killed at the end of the book was actually a half-wit albino that Griffin made invisible as a guinea pig, allowing him to escape to Rosa Coote's boarding school, where he rapes at least three women while posing as the Holy Spirit until he is captured by the rest of the League. He is portrayed as a power-hungry psychopath and murderer, as in the novel – at one point, killing a random policeman solely for his uniform and nearly abandoning the rest of the team on Professor Moriarty's cavorite-powered airship. In the second volume, he assaults Mina Murray and betrays his teammates to the Martians, stealing military plans for them so he could rule the Earth with them, and telling them to disable Nemo's submarine by doing something to the water in the Thames, which is why the Red Weed is used. Moore commented that it seemed fitting for Griffin to join the Martians as both hailed from novels by H. G. Wells. He is eventually raped and killed by Mister Hyde, who was able to see him all along as his vision operates in the infrared spectrum, a fact that he had hidden from Griffin.\n\nIn Jeff Lemire's \"The Nobody\", a graphic novel retelling of the Wells story, the Invisible Man is named John Griffen. The character goes through a similar episode as the \"Invisible Man\"s Griffin does. Both men hide out in an inn in a small town, only to be driven out because of fear and curiosity.\n\nThe Syfy television series \"The Invisible Man\" features thief/con man character Darien Fawkes (played by Vincent Ventresca) whose scientist brother worked on the development of a gland that made the subject invisibility by secreting a chemical known as 'quicksilver' throughout the body, the quicksilver bending light to render the subject invisible. Darien's nemesis was Arnaud DeFehrn, played by Joel Bissonnette, although he went by the Swiss-French name Arnaud De Thiel as a cover while working on the gland to sabotage it, DeFehrn's actions giving the gland a 'defect' where a low level of quicksilver seeping into the subject's brain will eventually drive the gland's owner insane without regular access to a specific drug to counter these effects. DeFehrn developed his own version of the gland, but became permanently invisible when it was imperfectly implanted. In attempting to retrieve the gland, he later uses the pseudonym Hawley Griffin (a reference to the League of Extraordinary Gentleman and the original Invisible Man), pretending to be a CIA agent from the South. The series concluded with DeFehrn's gland removed and Darien cured of the risk of quicksilver madness.\n\nIn the 2003 film adaptation of the \"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" comic book series, the Invisible Man who joins the League is not Griffin (due to copyright issues), but Rodney Skinner (played by Tony Curran), a cheerful thief who stole the invisibility formula from the original Invisible Man (presumably Griffin). The fact that his skin is invisible is also related to his name of \"Skinner\". Skin samples of him are taken by Dorian Gray for Professor Moriarty, allowing him to duplicate the invisibility process, Contrary to the graphic novels, Skinner remains loyal to the League, infiltrating Moriarty's base and working out how best to destroy it. During the raid on Moriarty's lair, Moriarty's own invisible man is shot by Allan Quatermain while threatening Tom Sawyer. At the film's conclusion, the plans are lost through a hole in the ice when Moriarty is shot, and Skinner decides to remain with the League, now composed of Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, Henry Jekyll, and Tom Sawyer.\n\nIn Claudio Fäh's 2006 Destination Films film \"Hollow Man 2\", Michael Griffin (played by Christian Slater) is a soldier upon whom the formula developed by Sebastian Caine five years earlier is applied by the Reisner Institute, as a part of a covertly Department of Defense-funded operation to create the perfect assassin for black ops missions, codenamed \"Silent Knight\". The film is a stand-alone sequel to the 2000 Columbia Pictures sci-fi horror thriller film \"Hollow Man\", directed by Paul Verhoeven.\n\n\n"}

Tight junctions may also serve as leaky pathways by forming selective channels for small cations, anions, or water. Tight junctions are present mostly in vertebrates (with the exeption of Tunicates). The corresponding junctions that occur in invertebrates are septate junctions.\n\nTight junctions are composed of a branching network of sealing strands, each strand acting independently from the others. Therefore, the efficiency of the junction in preventing ion passage increases exponentially with the number of strands.\nEach strand is formed from a row of transmembrane proteins embedded in both plasma membranes, with extracellular domains joining one another directly. There are at least 40 different proteins composing the tight junctions. These proteins consist of both transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins. The three major transmembrane proteins are occludin, claudins, and junction adhesion molecule (JAM) proteins. These associate with different peripheral membrane proteins such as ZO-1 located on the intracellular side of plasma membrane, which anchor the strands to the actin component of the cytoskeleton. Thus, tight junctions join together the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells.\n\nTransmembrane proteins:\n\n\nThey perform vital functions: \n\nIn human physiology there are two main types of epithelia using distinct types of barrier mechanism. Epidermal structures such as skin form a barrier from many layers of keratinized squamous cells. Internal epithelia on the other hand more often rely on tight junctions for their barrier function. This kind of barrier is mostly formed by only one or two layers of cells. It was long unclear whether tight cell junctions also play any role in the barrier function of the skin and similar external epithelia but recent research suggests that this is indeed the case.\n\nEpithelia are classed as \"tight\" or \"leaky\", depending on the ability of the tight junctions to prevent water and solute movement: \n\n\n"}

His most famous choral work is the Advent motet \"E'en So, Lord Jesus, Quickly Come\", which has been performed at the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at King's College, Cambridge, though its broadcast by the neighbouring Choir of St John's College, Cambridge, in its Advent Carol Service precipitated its popularity.\n\nHis most famous organ works are his volumes of neo-Baroque chorale preludes and partitas. Paul Manz long served the church as recitalist, composer, teacher and leader in worship. He was Cantor Emeritus at the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Saint Luke, Chicago, Illinois; as well as Cantor Emeritus of Mount Olive Lutheran Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was the director of the newly established Paul Manz Institute of Church Music, and was Professor Emeritus of Church Music at Christ Seminary Seminex at the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago.\n\nPaul Otto Manz was born to Otto and Hulda (Jeske) Manz in Cleveland, Ohio. Trained as an educator at Concordia Teacher's College in River Forest, Illinois (now Concordia University Chicago ) he earned a Master's Degree in Music at Northwestern University.\n\nA Fulbright grant enabled him to study with Flor Peeters in Belgium and Helmut Walcha in Germany. The Belgian government invited him to be the official United States representative in ceremonies honoring Flor Peeters on his 80th birthday and his 60th year as titular organist of the Cathedral of Saint Rombout in Mechelen, Belgium. At that time, Flor Peeters referred to his former student as ‘my spiritual son.’\n\nPaul Manz concertized extensively in North America. He appeared at Lincoln Center in New York City, with the National Symphony Orchestra, under conductor Geoffrey Simon, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at Orchestra Hall and with the Minnesota Orchestra under the direction of Charles Dutoit, Leonard Slatkin, and Henry Charles Smith. In addition, he played recitals in churches and cathedrals here and abroad. He was in great demand for his hymn festivals, which are his legacy as a church musician. He conducted many organ clinics, participated in liturgical seminars and appeared as lecturer and recitalist at the regional and national conventions of the American Guild of Organists.\n\nThe esteem and respect with which Paul Manz is regarded can be seen in the many honors he received. He was twice named one of the “Ten Most Influential Lutherans,” served as National Councilor of the American Guild of Organists and is listed as one of the “101 Most Notable Organists of the 20th Century.” He was the recipient of many honorary doctorates and awards. Northwestern University, his alma mater, presented him with the prestigious “Alumni Merit Award;.” The Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago presented him with the distinguished \"Confessor of Christ Award\"; The Chicago Bible Society presented him with the “Gutenberg Award; and the Lutheran Institute of Washington, DC honored him with the first “Wittenberg Arts Award.” At a convention of the Association of Lutheran Church Musicians, his colleagues honored him for his work in the church. A large gathering in Minneapolis, Minnesota held a “Paul Manz Celebration: Honoring the Life of a Church Musician” where substantial gifts were given to the Ruth and Paul Manz Scholarship for Church Musicians.\n\nTrinity Seminary of Columbus, Ohio bestowed the “Joseph Sittler Award for Theological Leadership” and among his many honorary doctorates is the Doctor of Sacred Music degree from Valparaiso University, and most recently, the Doctor of Music degree from St. Olaf College, Northfield, Minnesota.\n\nAs a performer, Manz was most famous for his celebrated hymn festivals. Instead of playing traditional organ recitals, Manz would generally lead a \"festival\" of hymns from the organ, in which he introduced each hymn with one of his famously creative organ improvisations based on the hymn tune in question. The congregation would then sing the hymn with his accompaniment. Sometimes he would play an improvisation between each sung stanza, as with his well-known variations on the tune, St. Anne, sung to the Isaac Watts text \"Oh God, Our Help in Ages Past\" with which he would traditionally end each festival. Many volumes of these improvisations have been written out and published and are played by church organists throughout the world.\n\nFrom 1957 until 1976, while continuing to serve at Mt. Olive, Dr. Manz was called to Concordia College, St. Paul, as professor and chair of the Division of Fine Arts. He left this position in 1976 to return to full-time parish service at Mt. Olive - now as Cantor. During his time there Paul developed the Hymn Festival for which he eventually became known throughout the world. Having heard his first hymn festival in 1945, Paul recast the format, adding the unique approach of bringing a number of hymns together under a theme with appropriate readings interspersed. He also brought back the ancient practice of alternation during the singing of hymns. He started doing this at weekly services at Mt. Olive, eventually exposing a wider audience to it through hymn festivals.\n\nPaul’s idea for the hymn festival began to germinate when he presented annual organ recitals at Mt. Olive: “I would always begin and end with a hymn; many people would come to those recitals, and I found that they thoroughly enjoyed singing the hymns. So finally, instead of doing a recital with a hymn at the beginning and the end, I did a program with hymns only. It caught on like wildfire, and I have subsequently presented hymn festivals all over the world.”\nConcordia St Paul Memorial Service Program\n\nHis musical compositions are internationally known. His organ works are extensively used in worship services, recitals and in teaching. His choral music is widely used by church and college choirs here and abroad. His motet, \"E'en So, Lord Jesus, Quickly Come\" is regarded as a classic and has been frequently recorded. His life and works are the subject of a doctoral dissertation which details his career spanning more than fifty years and analyzes his organ works.\n\n9.

{"id": "2022395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022395", "title": "The Electric Horseman", "text": "The Electric Horseman\n\nThe Electric Horseman is a 1979 American comedy-drama romance western film starring Robert Redford and Jane Fonda and directed by Sydney Pollack. The film is about a former rodeo champion who is hired by a cereal company to become its spokesperson, and then runs away on a $12 million electric-lit horse and costume he is given to promote it in Las Vegas.\n\nNorman \"Sonny\" Steele is a former championship rodeo rider who has sold out to a business conglomerate and is now reduced to making public appearances to sell a brand of breakfast cereal. Prior to making a Las Vegas promotional appearance to ride the $12 million champion thoroughbred race horse who responds to the name of Rising Star, Sonny discovers to his horror that the horse has been drugged and is injured.\n\nIdentifying with the plight of the horse and disillusioned with the present state of his life, Sonny decides to abscond with Rising Star and travel cross-country in order to release him in a remote canyon where herds of wild horses roam. Hallie Martin, a television reporter eager to be the first to break the Rising Star story, locates Sonny and follows him on his unusual quest through the countryside. While en route, the unlikely pair have a romance as they avoid the pursuing authorities.\n\nCasting for \"The Electric Horseman\" either continued or led to many reoccurring collaborations between cast and crew members. On November 28, 1978, Robert Redford was announced to star in the film, becoming the fifth film in which Sydney Pollack directed Redford following \"This Property Is Condemned\" (1966), \"Jeremiah Johnson\" (1972), \"The Way We Were\" (1973) and \"Three Days of the Condor\" (1975). This director-actor relationship would continue with two more films: \"Out of Africa\" (1985) and \"Havana\" (1990). Pollack had also previously directed Fonda in \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" (1969), whereas Redford and Fonda previously teamed on \"The Chase\" (1966) and \"Barefoot in the Park\" (1967).\n\n\"The Electric Horseman\" is noted as being the debut acting performance of long-time country and western singer Willie Nelson, who plays the role of Wendell Hickson. According to Pollack, Nelson improvised most of his dialogue in the film. Pollack would later be executive producer for Nelson's 1980 starring vehicle \"Honeysuckle Rose\". The film was also only the second film performance of character actor Wilford Brimley, who would later team with Redford in \"The Natural\" (1984).\n\nPrincipal photography for \"The Electric Horseman\" took place during late 1978 and early 1979 throughout Nevada and Utah. While the film was prominently shot on location in Las Vegas and Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, additional filming took place in various locations across the state of Utah, including Grafton, St. George, and Zion National Park.\n\nWhile filming generally went smoothly, Pollack struggled with revising the script while filming was underway. In addition, there was one particular day in which production was continuously delayed due to traveling thunderstorms that interrupted the 20-second kissing scene between Redford and Fonda. Ultimately, the scene ended up requiring 48 takes that pushed costs to $280,000. The film went over budget by $1.3 million, elevating it to $12.5 million.\n\nThe musical score to \"The Electric Horseman\" was composed by Dave Grusin. In addition to co-starring, Willie Nelson contributed significantly to the film's soundtrack as well, singing five songs including \"My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys\", \"Midnight Rider,\" \"Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys,\" \"So You Think You're a Cowboy\" and \"Hands on the Wheel.\" Coinciding with the film's release, a soundtrack album was released featuring both Nelson's songs and Grusin's score.\n\n\"The Electric Horseman\" was released theatrically in the United States on December 21, 1979. Even with the budget escalating to $12.5 million, the film was a box office success, becoming the eleventh highest grossing film of 1979 after grossing a domestic total of nearly $62 million. While the film was co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Universal Pictures, and distributed by Columbia domestically and Universal internationally, the US film rights would later revert to Universal. It has since been released on CED (Capacitance Electronic Disc) Videodiscs, VHS, Betamax, LaserDisc and DVD by Universal Studios, although current home video releases have replaced \"My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys\" with a generic instrumental sound-alike recording in the opening title sequence.\n\nWhile the film was a commercial success, it received mixed reviews upon release. Film review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 64% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 22 reviews with a \"Fresh\" rating, with an average score of 5.83/10. The film was also nominated for an Academy Award in 1980 for Best Sound (Arthur Piantadosi, Les Fresholtz, Michael Minkler and Al Overton Jr.). Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" called the film \"a nicely polished piece of entertainment from director Sydney Pollack, who regularly works with the biggest of stars and rarely lets his camera get in the way of those stars.\" Siskel, who gave the film three stars, highlighted what he detected to be genuine chemistry between Redford and Fonda. He also lauded the movie's \"outstanding secondary cast,\" including Saxon, Coster and Nelson.\n\n"}
{"id": "2022396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022396", "title": "Xanthate", "text": "Xanthate\n\nXanthate usually refers to a salt with the formula (R = alkyl; M = Na, K), thus O-esters of dithiocarbonate. The name \"xanthates\" is derived from Greek \"xanthos\", meaning “yellowish, golden”, and indeed most xanthate salts are yellow. They were discovered and named in 1823 by Danish chemist William Christopher Zeise. These organosulfur compounds are important in two areas: the production of cellophane and related polymers from cellulose and (in mining) for extraction of certain ores. They are also versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. Xanthates also refer to esters of xanthic acid. These esters have the structure ROC(=S)SR′.\n\nXanthate salts are produced by the reaction of an alkoxide salt with carbon disulfide. \nThe reaction involves the attack of the alkoxide nucleophile on the electrophile CS. Often the alkoxide is generated in situ by treating the alcohol with sodium or potassium hydroxide:\nFor example, sodium ethoxide gives sodium ethyl xanthate. Many alcohols can be used in this reaction. Technical grade xanthate salts are usually of 90–95% purity. Impurities include alkali-metal sulfides, sulfates, trithiocarbonates, thiosulfates, sulfites, or carbonates as well as residual raw material such as alcohol and alkali hydroxide. These salts are available commercially as powder, granules, flakes, sticks, and solutions are available. \n\nSome commercially important xanthate salts include:\n\nThe OCS core of xanthate salts, like that of the all-oxygen carbonates and other simple esters is characteristically planar. The central carbon is sp-hybridized.\n\nXanthate salts characteristically decompose in acid:\nThis reaction is the reverse of the method for the preparation of the xanthate salts. The intermediate in the decomposition is the xanthic acid, ROC(S)SH, which can be isolated in certain cases.\n\nXanthate anions also undergo alkylation to give xanthate esters, which are generally stable:\nThe C-O bond in these compounds are susceptible to cleavage by the Barton–McCombie deoxygenation, which provides a means for deoxygenation of alcohols.\n\nThey can be oxidized to the so-called dixanthogens:\n\nXanthates bind to transition metal cations as bidentate ligands. The charge-neutral complexes are soluble in organic solvents.\n\nCellulose reacts with carbon disulfide (CS) in presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to produces sodium cellulose xanthate, which upon neutralization with sulfuric acid (HSO) gives viscose rayon or cellophane paper (Sellotape or Scotch Tape).\n\nCertain xanthate salts and bisxanthates (e.g. Dixanthogen) are used as flotation agents in mineral processing. They are intermediates in the Chugaev elimination process and are used to control radical polymerisation under the RAFT process, also termed MADIX (macromolecular design via interchange of xanthates).\n\nRarely encountered, thioxanthates arise by the reaction of CS with thiolate salts. For example, sodium ethylthioxanthate has the formula CHSCSNa. Dithiocarbamates are also related compounds. They arise from the reaction of a secondary amine with CS. For example, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate has the formula (CH)NCSNa.\n\nXanthates may be toxic to aquatic life at concentrations of less than 1 mg/L. Water downstream of mining operations is often contaminated.\n"}

Under the name Wayne County (inspired by Wayne County, Michigan), she was the vocalist of influential proto-punk band Wayne County & the Electric Chairs who became known for their campy and foul-mouthed ballads, glam punk inspired songs, and image which was heavily influenced by Jackie Curtis and the Theatre of the Ridiculous. County in particular was known for her outrageous and unpredictable stage antics as well as possessing a distinctive singing voice. She went on to become rock's first openly transgender singer, and adopted the stage name Jayne County.\n\nCounty's music has encompassed a number of styles over the course of her career, including glam punk, punk rock, blues rock, and boogie-woogie. County did not think her birth name Wayne Rogers \"sounded very glamorous\" and decided to adopt the name of the county in which Detroit was located because she admired bands from that city \"like Iggy [Pop] and all those people.\" Though she has never been a commercial success, she has been an influence on a number of musicians including David Bowie, the Ramones, Patti Smith, Pete Burns and Lou Reed, and many of County's songs have become well-known, including \"Man Enough to Be a Woman\", \"Fuck Off\", \"Stuck on You,\" and \"Night Time\". Pianist Jools Holland's first studio outing was with County on her single \"Fuck Off\". She also appeared as an actress at Andy Warhol's Factory and had a brief association with David Bowie during the 1970s. County played 'Lounge Lizard\" in the first punk rock film, Derek Jarman's \"Jubilee\", and the band performed \"Paranoia Paradise\", which also appeared on the Jubilee Soundtrack album, released by Polydor UK in 1978. Wayne County and the Electric Chairs were supported by The Police during their 1977 tour of Holland, later recruiting Police guitarist Henry Padovani on rhythm guitar.\n\nBorn in 1947, County left her hometown of Dallas, Georgia, in 1968 at 19 years old to move to New York City, where she became a regular at the Stonewall Inn and took part in the historic riots. In 1969 County was asked by Warhol superstar and playwright Jackie Curtis to appear in her play, \"Femme Fatale\". The play had a successful run at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club and also starred Patti Smith. In her autobiography, County says of Curtis, \"She was my biggest influence, the person who really got me started.\" \n\nAfter appearing in \"Femme Fatale\", County wrote the play \"World – Birth of a Nation (The Castration of Man)\". The play was directed by Tony Ingrassia and promoted as a \"homosexual fantasy.\" The play was set in a hospital and related to castration of the male sex. County played both Florence Nitingale and her sister Ethel Nitingale, and the play also featured Cherry Vanilla who played a nurse named Tilly Tons.\n\nAfter seeing County in the play, Warhol cast her in his own theatrical production of \"Pork\", which was also adapted and directed by Tony Ingrassia. After a run in New York, the play was performed in London with the same New York cast. Upon returning to New York, County appeared in another play, \"Island\" by Tony Ingrassia, again with Patti Smith.\n\nIn 1972 County formed \"Queen Elizabeth\", one of the pioneering proto-punk bands. County was signed to MainMan Artistes, David Bowie's management firm, but no records were ever produced. The company spent over $200,000 to film the 1974 stage show, \"Wayne at the Trucks\", but footage has never been released. The show featured numerous costume changes and some of County's raunchiest material. Eight songs from the show were released on the 2006 album, \"\"Wayne County At the Trucks\"\", on Munster Records. County claims the show was the inspiration for Bowie's \"Diamond Dogs\" tour. In particular, County maintains that the song \"Queenage Baby\" was a prototype for Bowie's song \"Rebel Rebel\", a claim which is supported by some rock critics.\n\nIn 1974 County formed Wayne County and the Backstreet Boys, which recorded three tracks for \"Max's Kansas City: New York New Wave\", a compilation that also featured Suicide, Pere Ubu, Cherry Vanilla and The Fast. Wayne County and The Backstreet Boys played regularly at CBGB and Max's Kansas City, where County was also a DJ. In 1976, she appeared in the film \"The Blank Generation\", directed by Amos Poe and Ivan Kral. The film, the recording and the shows were the beginnings of what came to be known as punk rock, and helped define the movement.\n\nIn 1977 County moved to London, where the English punk scene was just emerging, and formed Wayne County & the Electric Chairs. County released the EP \"Electric Chairs 1977\", plus a single on Illegal Records. This was followed by \"Fuck Off\", recorded as a single for Safari Records and supported with a European tour. While in London, County met Derek Jarman, who cast her as \"Lounge Lizard\" in the seminal punk film \"Jubilee\", which also starred Adam Ant, Toyah Willcox, Ian Charleson, Little Nell and Jordan. County and band are also featured in \"The Punk Rock Movie\", by Don Letts, containing part of a 1977 performance at The Roxy club in London.\n\nIn 1978, the Wayne County song \"Fucked by the Devil,\" was recorded by Jimi LaLumia and The Psychotic Frogs. The song was released on Jimi LaLumia and The Psychotic Frogs' EP Typically Tasteless. It was a vinyl EP that instantly sold 10,000 copies. Later on Jimi LaLumia would work with Wayne County in a managerial position.\n\nShortly after this, Wayne County and The Electric Chairs recorded their first, eponymous album, as well as another EP, \"\"Blatantly Offensive\"\", which contained \"Fuck Off\" and \"Toilet Love.\" After their touring in support of these releases was done, they recorded \"\"Storm the Gates of Heaven\"\". Their next album, released in 1979, was \"\"Things Your Mother Never Told You\"\", which featured several songs based on County's experiences in Germany. The album was produced by David Cunningham. After it was released, the band broke up and County, along with guitarist Eliot Michaels, returned to the U.S.\n\nWhen County moved to Berlin in 1979, she changed her stage name to \"Jayne County\", publicly identifying as a woman for the first time. County's 1980 release of \"\"Rock and Roll Resurrection\" (In Concert)\" on Attic Records was under this new name. With Elliot Michaels on guitar, Peter Jordan on bass and Sammy Minelli on drums the first live show under County's new name in Toronto Canada, sparked erroneous rumours of a sex change operation.\n\nIn 1983 County returned to New York where she appeared in the theatrical production \"Les Girls\" with Holly Woodlawn. Shortly thereafter she returned to London for the première of the german film \"City of Lost Souls, released on 5 February '83\" in which she played Leila and staying long enough to record and tour another album. Warren Heighway befriended Jayne in Manchester and became her UK manager. He put a band together to record Jayne's debut studio album \"\"Private Oyster\". The\" band members came from various rock bands from the Manchester area. Guitarists Stu Clarke and Chris Lynch, bassist Mark Pearson and drummer Bazz Creece. The album was recorded at Pennine Studios in Oldham and released on Revolver Records in 1986. 1989 saw Jayne release the mini album \"Betty Grables Legs\" and the single \"Time Machine\" on Jungle Records, recorded at Station House Studios New Brighton with Mark Pearson on bass, Paul Wainwright on guitar and Kevin O'Brien on drums. Following widespread media attention, she returned to the U.S., where her manager for America, Jimi LaLumia, secured the release of the album \"Goddess Of Wet Dreams\" on the ESP DISK label; this became County's first U.S. release.Lalumia then secured a deal for County with the NY based label Royalty Records; Royalty released the UK based County compilation \"Rock & Roll Cleopatra\", and the subsequent studio album, \"Deviation\"; Royalty launched County's first and only major U.S. tour in support of the releases.\n\nFrom 1990 onwards many of County's earlier recordings were re-released, including the early Safari tracks, on a CD called \"\"Rock & Roll Cleopatra\"\". She recorded the album \"\"Goddess of Wet Dreams\"\" at Twilight Studios in Manchester in 1993, followed by \"\"Deviation\"\" recorded at The Cutting Rooms also in Manchester in 1995. Later that year, she appeared in \"\" and released her autobiography, \"\"Man Enough to Be a Woman\" on Serpent's Tail\" (press to read )From 1989–1997, Jayne County & The Electric Chairs consisted of Jayne on vocals, Mark Pearson on bass, Paul Wainwright on guitar, and Colin Rocks on drums. This lineup recorded and toured the UK and Europe during this time still with Warren Heighway acting as agent and Manchester Management for Trace Element Corporation. Warren Heighway passed away on 7/8/'05.\n\nSince that time several new tracks have surfaced on various compilations and through County's official website. Many of these tracks, both live and studio recordings, were collected on the Ratcage Records release \"So New York\", including collaborations with Lisa Jackson and former Electric Chairs guitarist Eliot Michaels. A live show, recorded on County's birthday, was released on the 2002 CD \"Wash Me in the Blood (of Rock & Roll)- Live at Squeeze Box\" by Fang Records. The CD features a duet on \"California Sun\" by County and former nemesis \"Handsome\" Dick Manitoba of The Dictators. In 2005 \"Man Enough To Be A Woman\" a Live DVD was released on Cherry Red Films recorded at Blackpool Winter Gardens on 11/8/'96 with Mark Pearson on bass, Paul Wainwright on guitar and Colin Rocks on drums. \n\nAfter leaving New York City, County settled in the Atlanta area where she has a band called the Electrick Queers with guitarist Jet Terror, bassist Gary Yoxen, and drummer Rob Kirkland. In 2014 Safari Records released a CD/DVD of Wayne \"County and The Electric Chairs, Live at Rockpalast Germany\" from 1978. On July 22, 2015, Jayne County & the Electrick Queers headlined ARMageddon, to benefit Blast-Off Burlesque's Trey Chic.\n\nOn 23 September 2017, County released a five-track extended play download by Jayne County and The JC5 entitled \"Here Come The JC5\".\n\nIn 2018, County debuted a retrospective show of visual art at Participant, Inc, a gallery in New York City. Comprising five decades of work, \"Paranoia Paradise\" included paintings, drawings, collages, and photography.\n\n\n"}

Concerned by the Conservative Party majority in the 1900 UK general election and the establishment of the Labour Representation Committee (LRC), he called the \"Democratic Convention\", aiming to bring together liberals and socialists on a basic democratic programme, inspired by Chartism.\n\nThe League's programme contained seven proposals: universal adult suffrage, automatic electoral registration, the abolition of multiple voting, for the state to cover election expenses, and to pay MPs, the abolition of the House of Lords, and the introduction of a two-round system of voting.\n\nAlthough the programme was limited, it did attract the support of some branches of the ILP and Social Democratic Federation. Their national organisations did not seek to prohibit them from participating, but were strongly critical of the limited focus of the League.\n\nTom Mann became the league's first Secretary, serving for three years; he was simultaneously employed as its full-time organiser. He was succeeded by Victor Fisher. Thompson served as the President, while David Lloyd George, Robert Smillie, W. C. Steadman and Richard Bell were among its Vice-Presidents.\n\nAlthough initial interest soon faded, Mann's work led to a short revival in its fortunes in 1902. At this time, the League was particularly strong in London; by 1902, it had 31 branches there, with 34 in the remainder of the country. However, it soon declined everywhere, particularly as the LRC gained strength and became the Labour Party. Thompson lost interest in the organisation, and Frank Hugh O'Donnell took over the presidency, while the Fabian James E. Dobson became Secretary, and John Ward became Chairman. It appears to have dissolved some time after 1911.\n"}

The headquarters of the gang was a rookery known as \"Gotham Court\" on Cherry Street in Lower Manhattan, which gave them access to the sewers under Cherry Street. This allowed the gang to easily raid the East River dockyards and sell off its valuable cargo within hours, before the thefts were discovered the following morning. With the Swamp Angels' success, the New York City Police Department began posting snipers to guard the waterfront. However, when these law enforcement measures did not slow down the Swamp Angels' criminal activities, the police were forced to send teams of officers into the sewers, which resulted in regular battles between the police and the gang members. Eventually, regular police patrols of the sewers forced the gang to halt its use of the underground labyrinth, although the gang continued to hijack cargo ships as they were being unloaded onto the wharfs.

{"id": "2022490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022490", "title": "American Buffalo (play)", "text": "American Buffalo (play)\n\nAmerican Buffalo is a 1975 play by American playwright David Mamet which had its premiere in a showcase production at the Goodman Theatre, Chicago. After two more showcase productions it opened on Broadway in 1977.\n\nAct I takes place at about 11 a.m. Don, who owns the junk shop where the entire play takes place, has sold a buffalo nickel to a customer for ninety dollars but now suspects it is worth considerably more. He and his young gofer, Bob (sometimes called Bobby), plan to steal the coin back. Bob has been keeping watch on the customer's house and reports that he has left for the weekend with a suitcase. Teach, a poker buddy of Don's, arrives and learns of the scheme. He persuades Don that Bob is too inexperienced and untrustworthy for the burglary, and proposes himself as Bob's replacement. Teach suggests they steal the whole coin collection and more. Don insists on their poker buddy Fletcher going with Teach. Teach continues to argue that he can do without Fletcher.\n\nAct II takes place a little before midnight on the same day. Teach and Don make final preparations to begin the burglary while waiting for Fletcher, who is late. Teach tells Don that Fletcher is a liar and a cheater at cards, and prepares to go commit the burglary on his own. Don is trying to persuade him not to take his gun with him when Bob appears at the store. He attempts to sell Don a buffalo nickel, similar to the one Don had sold the customer. When asked where he got the coin, Bob is evasive. Teach suspects that Bob and Fletcher have organized and completed their own burglary behind Don and Teach's backs. He asks Bob where Fletcher is. Bob tells him that Fletcher was mugged by some Mexicans and is in a hospital, but when Don calls the hospital, they have no record of his admission. Bob claims that he must have been mistaken about the name of the hospital, but the suspicious Teach strikes him on the head with a metal object. Another friend calls, corroborating Bob's story and naming the correct hospital. Don calls the hospital and confirms that Fletcher has been admitted with a broken jaw. Bob confesses that he made up the story about the customer leaving with a suitcase, and that he bought the second nickel from a coin dealer to make up to Don for his failure to keep tabs on the customer. Don admonishes Teach for wounding Bob and orders him to get his car so they can take him to the hospital.\n\nAs is emblematic of Mamet's writing style, the play's dialogue is sometimes terse and often vulgar. Teach says \"cunt\" numerous times and both Don and Teach say \"fuck\" even more. By way of contrast, the younger character Bobby only says \"fuck\" in situations of extreme duress: immediately after being beaten and his final apology to Donny. Mamet's profanity is not employed for shock value, but is rather an integral component of his characters' \"profane poetry\", which, according to frequent collaborator Gregory Mosher, \"worked the iambic pentameter out of the vernacular of the underclass.\" The characters' sometimes vulgar lexicon, moreover, may be seen as psychologically necessary armor against their brutal environment.\n\nThe parenthetical stage directions are straightforward and do not provide line readings.\n\n\"American Buffalo\" opened at the Goodman Theatre Stage II on November 23, 1975, directed by Gregory Mosher with the cast that featured William H. Macy (Bobby), Bernard Erhard (Teach), and J.J. Johnston (Donny).\n\nThe play premiered Off-Broadway at the Theatre at St. Clement's Church on January 26, 1976 and closed on February 7, 1976. Directed by Gregory Mosher, the cast featured Mike Kellin (Teach), Michael Egan (Donny) and J. T. Walsh (Bobby).\n\nThe play premiered on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on February 8, 1977 in previews, officially on February 16, 1977, and closed on June 11, 1977 after 122 performances. Directed by Ulu Grosbard, the cast featured Robert Duvall (Teach), Kenneth McMillan (Donny), and John Savage (Bobby). Sets were by Santo Loquasto and lighting by Jules Fisher.\n\nThe play was produced Off-Broadway at the Circle in the Square (Downtown) in June 1981, starring Al Pacino as Teach, Thomas Waites (Bobby) and Clifton James (Donny) and directed by Arvin Brown. This production ran at the Long Wharf Theater, New Haven, in 1980.\n\nThe play was revived on Broadway at the Booth Theatre, running from October 20, 1983 (previews) to February 4, 1984. Directed by Arvin Brown, the cast starred Al Pacino (Walter Cole, called Teach), James Hayden (Bobby) and J. J. Johnston (Donny Dubrow). The production was nominated for the 1984 Tony Award, Revival (Play or Musical), and Pacino was nominated for the 1984 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Play. During the November 8th performance of this run, actor James Hayden received a standing ovation for his performance, then 6 hours later died of a heroin overdose while on the phone with his estranged wife while in his Upper West Side apartment. He was replaced by his understudy, John Shepard.\n\nThe play was presented at the Donmar Warehouse, London, from January 28, 2000 to February 26, starring William H. Macy (Teach), Philip Baker Hall (Donny) and Mark Webber (Bobby), directed by Neil Pepe. This production transferred to Off-Broadway at the Atlantic Theatre Company in March 2000 and closed on May 21, 2000. (Mamet and Macy are co-founders of the Atlantic Theatre Company.)\n\nA production took place in April/May 2002 at Royal Exchange, Manchester, UK, directed by Greg Hersov. It featured Mike McShane as Donny, Ben Keaton as Teach, and Paul Popplewell as Bobby. Ben Keaton won Best Actor and Paul Popplewell was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Manchester Theatre Awards (M.E.N.) & TV Awards.\n\nThe play was revived on Broadway in 2008 and starred Cedric the Entertainer, Haley Joel Osment, and John Leguizamo, but closed after 8 performances.\n\nThe play was produced at Wyndham's Theatre in the West End, London, UK, directed by Daniel Evans and starring John Goodman as Donny, Damian Lewis as Teach, and Tom Sturridge as Bobby. The show ran from 17 April to 27 June 2015.\n\nThe 2017 Seattle Immersive Theatre production was in an abandoned storefront on the eve of demolition.\n\nThe play will be revived on Broadway in a production directed by Neil Pepe and starring Laurence Fishburne, Sam Rockwell and Darren Criss at Circle in the Square Theatre. It was set to begin previews in March 2020 with an official opening on April 14.\n\nAs of March 12, 2020, the show suspended production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The show’s production will be suspended until September 6, 2020 at the earliest. \n\nCritic Frank Rich, in reviewing the 1983 production for \"The New York Times\", called it \"one of the best American plays of the last decade.\" Rich had previously reviewed the 1981 Off-Broadway production, calling the play \"brilliant\", and noting: \"The play, though, is the thing. Working with the tiniest imaginable vocabulary - words like \"nothing,\" \"great,\" and \"no,\" as well as those of four letters - Mr. Mamet creates a subterranean world with its own nonliterate comic beat, life-and death struggles, pathos and even affection... In \"American Buffalo,\" he has created a deceptively small-scale tragedy that is packed with the power to explode the largest of American myths.\"\n\nThe 1975 production won the Obie Award, Best New Play and Performance (Mike Kellin). The production won the 1977 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, Best American Play.\n\nThe 1977 Broadway production was nominated for two Tony Awards: Best Direction of a Play and Best Scenic Design (Santo Loquasto). It received four Drama Desk Award nominations, including Outstanding New Play (American), and won for Outstanding Set Design.\n\nJ. J. Johnston received a Theatre World Award for his portrayal of Donny.\n\nThe 1983 revival was nominated for the Tony Award, Best Revival and the Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Play (Pacino).\n\nThe play was also adapted to a 1996 film, with Dennis Franz (Don), Dustin Hoffman (Teach), and Sean Nelson (Bobby).\n\n"}

According to the traditions of the Baganda they are ruled by two kings, one spiritual and the other secular.\n\nThe spiritual, or supernatural, king is represented by the Royal Drums, regalia called \"Mujaguzo\" and, as they always exist, the Buganda at any time will always have a king. \"Mujaguzo\", like any other king, has his own palace, officials, servants and palace guards. The material, human prince has to perform special cultural rites on the Royal Drums before he can be declared king of the Kingdom of Buganda. Upon the birth of a royal prince or princess, the Royal Drums are sounded by drummers specially selected from a specified clan as a means of informing the subjects of the kingdom of the birth of a new member of the royal family. The same Royal Drums are sounded upon the death of a reigning king to officially announce the death of the material king. According to Buganda culture, a king does not die but gets lost in the forest. Inside Buganda's royal tombs such as the Kasubi Tombs and the Wamala Tombs, one is shown the entrance of the forest. It is a taboo to look beyond the entrance.\n\nBuganda has no concept equivalent to the Crown Prince. All the princes are equally treated prior to the coronation of a new king following the death of a reigning monarch. However, during the period of a reigning king, a special council has the mandate to study the behavior and characteristics of the young princes. The reigning king, informed by the recommendation of the special council, selects one prince to be his successor. In a secret ceremony, the selected prince is given a special piece of bark cloth by the head of the special verification council. The name of the \"king-to-be\" is kept secret by the special council until the death of the reigning king. When all the princes and princesses are called to view the body of the late king lying in state, the selected prince lays the special piece of bark cloth over the body of the late king, revealing himself as the successor to the throne.\n\nBy tradition, Baganda children take on the clan of their biological fathers. It is a common misconception that the Kabaka (king) of Buganda takes his clan from his mother. Some go as far as saying that Buganda's royal family was matrilineal. Neither of these assertions is true.\nThe Kabaka has his own clan which is called the royal clan \"Olulyo Olulangira\". Members of this clan are referred to as abalangira for males and abambejja for females. The misconception arose in part because the royal clan has no totem which is something that all other Baganda clans have. However, the totem should not be confused with the clan. The totem is just a symbol but the clan is a matter of genealogy. The royal clan has its own genealogy traced along the patrilineal line, extending all the way back to Kintu.\n\nThe firstborn prince, by tradition called Kiweewa, is not allowed to become king. That was carefully planned to protect him against any attempted assassinations in a bid to fight for the crown. Instead, he is given special roles to play in the matters of the royal family and kingdom. Thus, the name of the possible successor to the throne remains secret.\n\nThe following are the known Kings of Buganda, starting from around 1300 AD.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2022524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022524", "title": "Ring of Fire (anthology)", "text": "Ring of Fire (anthology)\n\nRing of Fire is the third published book by editor-author-historian Eric Flint of the 1632 series, an alternate history series begun in the novel \"1632\" (February 2000). The \"Ring of Fire\" is both descriptive of the cosmic event as experienced by the series' characters, but also is at times used as the name for the series itself. The series is set in war-torn Europe during the middle of the Thirty Years' War.\n\n\"Ring of Fire\" is a collection of short stories —half by a variety of established science fiction authors invited into the setting, half fan-fiction by enthusiasts who helped take the stand-alone novel into a series numbering works in the tens of books; all set in the universe initially created by Flint's science fiction novel \"1632\" written as a stand-alone novel and turned into a series by popular demand. Unlike most short works in a novel created series, the stories within are important milieu shaping creations—story threads which are formalized into the series canon for they helped establish it, and act as a spring board for further developments in the books. Many characters debut in these short stories who play an important role in subsequent longer works.\n\nThe series heralds a new kind of writing, blending both shared universe and collaborative fiction writing in large series fiction. As in other shared universes, the stories are set in a milieu shared with other writers, but usually it's done with other author's stories being set safely somewhere off to the side of the main story threads. Flint demonstrated that a series could be successfully written by ignoring convention, and deliberately asking the other writers to share in creating the main threads and plot lines of the milieu. The first two novels in the series, \"1632\" and \"1633\", were written contemporaneously so that story threads started in one novel could intermingle and generate matching action or background in the other, and vice versa.\n\nFlint is on record saying that large portions of \"1633\" were adjusted drastically, even thrown out and rewritten as later submissions to the 1632 series impacted the various and diverse story threads. For a fuller look on this literary development see Assiti Shards series. For the fullest enjoyment of all three books, it is best to read them in the order \"1632\", \"Ring of Fire\", and then \"1633\". Interchanging the last two has a relatively minor cost to understanding and in appreciation that can be avoided.\n\nFlint has stated that he intends that short stories featuring major characters, or establishing points that will be important in future novels will be collected into the \"Ring of Fire\" anthologies, and that \"The Grantville Gazettes\" anthologies will feature the stories of characters that don't establish new background for the novels. However, many of the characters or events become more important in retrospect than either the author or editor expected, so this rule is fairly weak.\n\nWeber's short story sets up major story elements that play out in \"1633\" and . In particular, the story tells how the New United States Navy (and that of future Empire of the United States of Europe) came to be in the resource strapped days of 1632–33. Most notably, through the eyes and experiences of young Eddie Cantrell, the story begins the rehabilitation of John Chandler Simpson who was cast as quite unlikeable in \"1632\". Through the eyes of Simpson, Cantrell and fellow up-timers Jere Haygood and Pete McDougal we get a picture of the chaos involved in rebuilding Magdeburg after the city was sacked by Tilly's forces.\n\nTo Dye For introduces the absent minded purveyor of Wacky-Tabbacky Tom Stone and his three boys as he strives for respectability in the eyes of guildmaster Karl Jurgen Edelmann, father of spinster Magdalena Edelmann and main head-over-heels love interest of Tom \"Stoner\" Stone. As a daughter of a guildmaster, Magdelena Stone was wasting away as a spinster in her early 30s until a delegation from her town visited Grantville and she met her soul-mate, Tom Stone. His initial courting was received with favor, until her father decided \"Stoner\" wasn't the man of means he'd mistaken him to be.\n\n\"Stoner\" is the last adult in the former 1970s \"Lothlorian Commune\" and had been enticed away from Pharmacology graduate school by a hippy \"Chick\" named Lisa. In the free love community of Lothlorien, whether \"Elrond\" (Ronald Stone) \"might be\" his child is a question he has long abandoned, but it is genetically certain that the \"Stop sign red\" colored hair of \"Gwaihir\" (Gerry Stone) makes him someone else's boy, who is nonetheless being raised as one of his own.\n\nAs this story opens, a glum Stoner is introduced to Dr. James Nichols by Mike Stearns, and the two have come by to pick up a horse-drawn cart load of Stoner's \"patented West Virginia Wildwood Weed\" (which originated in a pilgrimage to Holland) that Stoner uses as an emergency cash crop grown in his ramshackle home-made greenhouse constructed from various junk automobile sections, windows thrown in the trash, and a lot of effort and ingenuity. At the same time, interjected into this conversation are barbs by the German boy driving the horse cart just identified as 'Klaus' such as \"Und Magdalena vould haf better prospects elsewhere, you haf no \"income\", Stoner. Effen der Veed, you gifs to der Doc\".\n\nStoner, who is particularly adept with recreational extra-sensory stimulatory compounds, especially as a pharmacological graduate school drop-out from Purdue University, refuses to take payment for the weed, saying repeatedly that he wouldn't make money off of other people's pain. Klaus turns even that negative: \"Dat earns you a place in Heaffen, maybe, but on Earth, no income.\" The matter becomes the topic of a general family discussion after the medical visitors have left, brought up by the boys. Soon, the family conference reminds Stoner of a past fiasco at a town fair where a cloud-burst had ruined the sales of many exotically tie-dyed tee-shirts, also ruining what would have been a great day as the tee-shirts hadn't been processed to set the dye into the cloth—inadvertently dyeing many a now irate customer. But Stoner knew how to make things colorfast, he was a very good chemist, and had loads of left over dyes here and there on the grounds.\n\nSoon, with the boys' eager help, the Stones go into the serial production of embroidery yarns. Karl Edelman is impressed and Stoner has a new life partner, one with a ruthless business savvy that he'd never had. As the story closes, Stoner is recalling the history of early organic dyes leading up to the Mauve Decade, when coal-tar dyes such as Perkin's mauve were developed and generated huge fortunes. The neat thing is it would be ecologically sound, for the dyes needed could be taken from the coal-fired power plant with the addition of scrubbers on the chimneys. Splitting the profits bothered Stoner not a bit. They would be huge.\n\n\nIn the after-story, the sequel \"\", Magda accompanies her antibiotic analgesic and clothing dye wizard of a husband to a year-long posting to lecture at the University of Padua, as part of the Embassy sent to Venice. There, she takes her husband's wealth and shows the business acumen learned at her father's side and a shrewd judgment of men and ruthlessness which built it into a fortune, and turns the couple into the wealthiest family in Europe with the able assistance of Sharon Nichols, who builds up a considerable fortune of her own.\n\nScottish military dispatch carrier Douglas Lawrey falls in with telephone repairman Len Tanner and irascible coal mine switchboard operator Ellie Anderson. Due to their limited people skills, the technologically stranded pair have been unable to convince anyone to develop telecommunications abilities beyond Grantville. After Ellie reveals the old-tech phone she has been prototyping, Douglas talks them into forming a corporation.\n\nWhile stringing the first phone line to nearby Saalfeld, Len and a downtime assistant are captured by a group planning to hijack a Grantville gun shipment. In the struggle, the prototype phone is damaged, but the trussed up Len finds the battery and wires and manages to send an SOS to Grantville.\n\nAfter foiling the hijack, Ellie realizes that the old-tech phone was still too high tech for the time period. Morse keys can be manufactured quickly, and investors found to fund the telegraph wire network.\n\nSet before and during the Croatian attack on Grantville, this story revolves around the Catholic Church. Papal diplomat Monsignor (not yet Cardinal) Mazarini sends Jesuit Father Heinzerling to report on Grantville. Due to political issues with Rome, France and Spain, Mazarini cannot open diplomatic discussions, so when Heinzerling returns, he unofficially sends him back to be the curate for Grantville's Catholic church. Uptimer Irene Flannery, a faithful but harsh elderly widow who has always helped the church, is horrified and offended by Heinzerling's girlfriend and three children, even after Father Mazarre marries them. Irene quits her charity work and becomes entirely isolated. She refuses to take shelter during the Croatian attack, and dies in her front yard. Father Mazarre is wracked by guilt, as well as anger that the current wars all claim to be for the sake of religion. He resolves not to stand by silently any more, and sends his uptime Catholic books to the Vatican.\n\nVeronica Richter (Hans and Gretchen Richter grandmother) gets fake teeth, opens a daycare center/preparatory academy and is courted by Henry Dreeson.\n\nA technically plausible description of what happens at the power plant in the immediate aftermath of the Ring of Fire event. There is panic, of course, but also resourcefulness as the plant's staff struggles to recover from an event they don't understand.\n\n\"\"A Matter of Consultation\"\" by veteran science fiction author S. L. Viehl expands on the character Sharon Nichols created by Flint, who becomes one of the lead characters in both 1633 and the South European thread's two novels, and . Also in \"\"A Matter of Consultation\"\" Viehl introduces the nurse Ann Jefferson, a classmate of Nichols whom he pairs with Nichols in this story. Flint later will make her into an American poster girl of sorts in his purpose written short stories in each of the Grantville Gazettes I, II and III where she is caught up in the Siege of Amsterdam and ends up as the common subject of many famous down-time artists starting with Peter Paul Rubens and including Rembrandt, who is a virtual unknown at the time. Those three stories set canon for increased information flow and detail the beginning of a common postal system across Europe.\n\nViehl has Nichol's and Jefferson face off against Dr. William Harvey, the \"discoverer\" of the circulatory system, and the two nurses \"give him some pointers\", including a severe dressing down. Concurrently, Anne Jefferson meets her future husband, diplomat and mathematician Adam Olearius, who is traveling as diplomat and guide to Harvey in this story. In canonical importance, Dr. Harvey visits Grantville, and its libraries, and as a courtesy, has some medical books copied for him. While killing time he discovers encyclopedias and has pages detailing English History copied at the end of his stay. Charles I of England uses these warnings of the revolution to change England to repress the future revolution, thus setting the stage for the English international politics in the series.\n\nJohannes Grünwald, an artist forced by his mother's family to become a Jesuit priest, returns hunted, poor and starving to his family estate near Grantville. Johannes is welcomed by his old playmate Frank Erbst, who is now caring for the estate.\n\nThe Grünwald family has a complex religious history. Johannes' stiff-necked Protestant brother Marcus allowed his beloved Catholic wife to raise their son Martin Catholic. After his wife's death, however, Marcus tried to force Martin and his wife Louisa to baptise their son Johann as a Protestant. To escape, Martin joined Tilly's army. Due to the turmoil of war, young Johann went missing. He is believed to be in Grantville, but Marcus regards Grantville as evil and has forbidden Frank to go there.\n\nJohannes explains that he lost faith after the sack of Magdeburg and was unable to continue his task of drawing pictures of the war. He was arrested for heresy and blasphemy, and placed under guard. He escaped and walked to the estate, but the corpses he found in farmhouses along the way tormented him. Frank gives drawing materials to Johannes, who wrestles with his demons. When soldiers arrive on the estate, Johannes expects to be taken prisoner. However, they are Americans, and they take him back to Grantville.\n\n\"When the Chips are Down\" explores some of the issues involved in \"gearing down\". Larry Wild is one of the Four Musketeers introduced midway through the novel 1632, and is the central character in this tale. Larry's employment in one of Grantville's machine shops goes poorly: he demonstrates a regrettable inconsistency and an inability to pay proper and timely attention, and so breaks valuable and irreplaceable machine tool cutting heads. Most of the story involves preparations for a Christmas celebration which Larry presses forward with despite experience and difficulties. While trying to recreate a formerly enjoyed uptime snack, there are humorous adverse interactions with members of the extended family of Jeff Higgins and Gretchen Higgins, especially her formidable grandmother Veronica Richter.\n\nFormer star high school athletes decide to start a baseball league and try to interest downtimers in the sport.\n\nDowntimer Gerd is concerned that many Germans who were formerly Tilly's soldiers have been welcomed into Grantville's army. He recognizes a trio that he served with, whose atrocities sickened him until he fled the group. The trio deserts, taking their valuable uptime guns and robbing several Grantville houses to get ammunition. Gerd knows their destination: a farm where they tortured and killed an old man for his wealth, then hid the loot in an outhouse. He ambushes them, and the loot is donated to a Grantville church.\n\nVeronica Junius, daughter of the burgomaster of Bamberg burned as a witch, is also been tortured and found guilty of witchery by ecclesiastical court. She escapes, but is captured. Inquisitor Eberhardt suggests taking her to Würzburg for civil trial before she can be burned, but the Captain insists on bringing her to Suhl, where she will have no friends to aid her. Jesuit Friedrich von Spee, historical author of a treatise against using torture in witchcraft trials, is asked by the prince-bishop of Mainz to observe.\n\nSuhl has been accepted into the United States, and Veronica's previous trial is found invalid there due to the forced confession. She is sent to Grantville \"for a new trial,\" where she is given medical treatment and comforted by Father Mazarre. She explains that in the four years since her father was burned and all his property seized, she could only support herself via prostitution. Discussing witch hunts, Mazarre recalls a historical figure that they should recruit — von Spee, who then introduces himself.\n\nDue to the Counter-Reformation, The Unity of the Brethren church has been expelled from Liechtenstein and Bohemia, and driven underground in Poland. Trying to keep the church alive in exile, Bishop Comenius sends Deacon Billek to Grantville to see if they can help. Grantville and the Brethren agree on two important issues: religious tolerance and education. Billek finds that Grantville cannot assist the Brethren where they are, but offers sanctuary for any refugees. However, union agitator Red Sybolt is moved by their plight, and accompanies Billek on his return trip to teach the three R's: \"reading, righting and revolution.\"\n\nJulie MacKay arranges a Christmas party for the many orphans in the area. While preparations for this event quickly snowball, three emissaries from Wallenstein are sent to find her. Meanwhile, two of the Emperor's soldiers decide to blow up Grantville's school with two powderkegs. At the denouement, the attack is foiled and Pappenheim explains that Wallenstein simply wants an alliance with Grantville and new teeth from Julie's dentist father.\n\nFlint's novelette set in December 1632—Spring 1633, is the basis for a major plot thread in the milieu, the Eastern European thread. In the 1632-verse, Albrecht von Wallenstein was near-fatally wounded by the sniper fire of sharp shooting Julie Sims at the fictional Battle of Alte Veste. Wallenstein decides he'd prefer to ally with Gustavus and the Americans rather than face the assassination the Americans' history books have him slated for in 1634. He'd also rather not face them or Gustavus again in battle, and in particular not the American rifles which tore up his jaw and put him in declining health since he could not ingest solids. His mutilated jaw was also the reason that he allied with his former enemies as believed that only the American's medical health care could fix his jaw (see \"Here Comes Santa Claus\").\n\nHe plots (together with Gottfried Pappenheim) to expel imperial administrators from Bohemia and depose the absent Archduke Ferdinand III of Austria, then also king of Hungary (1625) and Bohemia (1629) whilst he was occupied opposing the Ottoman Empire while his father Ferdinand II prosecuted the Thirty Years' War triggered by his reign in Bohemia. Meanwhile, Len Tanner and Ellie Anderson (see \"Lineman for the Country\") come to install a telephone system for Wallenstein's residence in Prague, and a Jewish couple from Grantville settles in Prague and gains influence in Josefov, the Jewish quarter.\n\nWallenstein's coup succeeds, but he must take his troops out of Prague to meet Ferdinand's army in a \"Second Battle of White Mountain\". Mercenary chief Heinrich Holk decides to exploit their absence and attack the city. However, successors of religious hussites (\"The Brethren\") and the Jewish population band together as citizen defenders of Prague, led by elderly American tycoon Morris Roth, who amazes himself by becoming a popular leader: don Morris, hidalgo of Jews.\n\nAt the heart of the storyline backplot and that of Flint's Eastern European thread is the Chmielnicki Rebellion, refers to a rebellion or war of liberation in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (present-day Ukraine), which raged from 1648–1654 and involved massive anti-semitic pogroms. Many of the Jews targeted had fled central and western Europe because the plague years in the 14th century had inspired pogroms, as did the spread of Lutheranism which was at the heart of the Thirty Years' War.\n\nThe Khmelnytsky Uprising decimated the Jewish population and is considered to be one of the most traumatic events in Jewish history. In The Wallenstein Gambit storyline, Jewish character Morris Roth is haunted by this and hopes to prevent the prospective loss of life.\n\n\"Publishers Weekly\" mentions \"how neatly the other authors' tales in this strong anthology dovetail with Flint's series\" and how the \"individual contributors concentrate less on the impact that the displaced Americans' technology makes than on how their ideas—and ideals—inspire those newly exposed to them\". Jackie Cassada of the Library Journal called the book a \"topnotch choice for alternate history fans and essential for libraries owning 1632 and 1633\" and that these \"15 stories contribute directly to the main plot lines of the series and illustrate the complex and multifaceted nature of historical fiction.\"\n\nRing of Fire was listed on the Locus (magazine) Hardcovers Bestsellers List for two months in a row during 2004, topping at number 2.\n\n\n"}

Rudder (Camp Rudder) is host to the third and final phase of a nine-week training course, dubbed the \"swamp phase\", of the U.S. Army Ranger School. The camp is located on the Eglin Air Force Base reservation, co-located with Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field #6 / Biancur Field, approximately fourteen miles northwest of the main Eglin AFB airfield.\n\nThe Florida Ranger Camp was established November 15, 1951, by then Major Arthur \"Bull\" Simons who was named the Commander of the Amphibious/Jungle Training Committee at Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field #7 / Epler Field, which was the initial location of the camp. Colonel Simons was later the commander of the prisoner of war rescue attempt on Son Tay, North Vietnam. The Florida Ranger Camp remained at Field Seven for 20 years until it was moved to Field Six in January 1970. \n\nThe current Camp Rudder was named for Major General James E. Rudder, USA in June 1974. MG Rudder commanded the 2d Ranger Battalion when it scaled the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc, France, during the 1944 D-Day Normandy invasion.\n\nBiancur Field, Eglin Auxiliary Field #6, was named for 1st Lt Andrew Biancur, USAAF, a test pilot of the Medium Bombardment Section of the 1st Proving Ground Group, killed in crash of a prototype YP-61-NO Black Widow, AAF Ser. No. \"41-18883\", c/n 711, on 8 January 1944 at Eglin Field.\n\nBiancur Field, as Eglin AFB Aux Field #6, remains the airfield portion of Camp Rudder and was previously used by the U.S. Navy's Training Squadron 4 (TRARON 4 or VT-4) at nearby Naval Air Station Pensacola in the early 1960s for strike pilot training. The squadron aircraft were T2J Buckeyes and Biancur was used for Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) touch-and-go landings before student pilots were allowed to land on board the training carrier of the period, the USS \"Antietam\" (CV-36). Meals for the sailors on TAD (Temporary Assigned Duty) at Biancur were supplied by the U.S. Army Rangers at Field 7. With the advent of the more advanced T-2C Buckeye and TA-4J Skyhawk II and the retirement of Antietam to be replaced by the aircraft carrier USS \"Lexington\" (CVT-16 / AVT-16), VT-4 shifted FCLP operations to Outlying Field Choctaw (OLF Choctaw), A Navy airfield formerly known as Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field #10, to the west of Camp Rudder. With the Navy's departure, all Biancur Field operations passed over to the Army.\n\nOver the years, twenty-four Army Ranger students have died while in training at Camp Rudder, including four who died in a 1955 training accident, two Ranger students who died of hypothermia in January 1977, and another four who died of exposure during cold-weather flooding in February 1995. The 1995 accident was blamed on several factors, including a sudden rise in the water level on Boiling Creek coupled with other unexpected weather changes, such as fog that delayed rescue efforts. Since 1995, more sophisticated measures have been put into place that cast an elaborate, yet invisible, safety net around the students. As students plan ambushes and negotiate swamps, field ambulances are posted minutes away. Evacuation helicopters and rescue boats are on standby and are constantly advised of changing conditions. Before students enter the water, divers check out conditions. An elaborate system to monitor weather and water conditions and depths exists at every step in the exercise.\n\nTraining remains tough for the men who aspire to be the Army's most elite warriors. The Army has also placed more emphasis on protecting Rangers during training. Camp officials say that with lessons learned from a training accident in 1995, and more resources thanks to allocations from the U.S. Congress, the danger of training casualties has been greatly reduced.\n\n"}

The dialogue brims with that distinctive Mamet style of unfinished sentences and jabbing, intercepting, interrupted conversation... The adults are very repetitive as is the boy when his stream of questions is not answered... It seems that what we are watching is the child’s memory of the events of that night and the day, weeks later, when he has to move out of his home. There are too many gaps that seem improbable from an adult’s point of view, like Donny’s reaction to the note from her husband leaving her. No asking, Why? No talk about a meeting with her husband... It is very difficult for English actors to play Mamet well, to get the timing perfect but under Josie Rourke’s direction this cast pulls it off.\"\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 15, 2002. In the episode, the Simpson family wins a free spa weekend, and Homer is nearly killed when a mysterious figure locks him in a sauna. Chief Wiggum decides to hire someone who can think like a murderer in order to find the mystery assailant. Bart's mortal enemy Sideshow Bob is sent to live with the Simpsons so he can help find Homer's attempted killer, who turns out to be the son of a man whom Homer drove to insanity. \n\nSince airing, the episode has received generally positive reviews from critics, though it has been cited as not being as good as some other Sideshow Bob episodes. The episode's title is a parody of the 1986 Disney animated feature \"The Great Mouse Detective\".\n\nThe Simpsons win a free spa weekend. At the spa, Homer is nearly killed when a mysterious person locks him into an incredibly hot steam room with a spanner, but he is saved when Krusty the Clown unlocks the door. This prompts Homer and Marge to see Chief Wiggum, who suggests that they seek help from someone who can understand a murderer's twisted mind – Sideshow Bob, who is released from prison, much to Bart's discomfort. To ensure Bart's safety, Wiggum places a shock bracelet on Sideshow Bob's ankle to keep his murderous urges at bay when he comes to live at the Simpson house. Bob asks Homer to list all the people who may want him dead, and follows him around to investigate who the mystery assailant could be. During their day, they end up at a repair shop, where Homer chastises the mechanic, Junior.\n\nHomer and Bob go to Moe's Tavern, where the assailant fires at Homer with a gun, before escaping in a tow truck. Bob suggests that Homer should stay home and out of sight to be safe, but the latter is named the King of the Springfield Mardi Gras, in which he must ride on a float for the whole day. Bob discovers that Homer won because someone rigged the ballot in his favour, but Homer takes part in the parade anyway in hopes of luring out his attempted killer. At the parade, Bob learns that a brake line on Homer's float has been cut, and draws a correlation between the wrench used to lock Homer in the steam room, the wrenches in the tow truck and a smudge on the spa invitation, realizing that Junior is the killer. As the float goes out of control, Bob saves Homer by getting fired out of a cannon and grabbing Homer with his huge feet from above, just before the float crashes into the Museum of Swordfish.\n\nHomer and Bob end up giving chase to the killer, who is revealed to be Frank Grimes Jr., the illegitimate son of Frank Grimes, who blames Homer for his father's death. Junior attempts to kill Homer, but is foiled when the police arrive. That night, after Homer puts Bart in bed, Bob takes possession of the remote for his shock bracelet and sneaks into Bart's room, intending to kill him. However, Bob realizes he is accustomed to Bart's face and cannot bring himself to do it. He tries to take his leave, but gets zapped continuously by his shock bracelet (because of birds pecking the remote after it landed in their nest).\n\n\"The Great Louse Detective\" was written by John Frink and Don Payne and directed by Steven Dean Moore as part of the fourteenth season of \"The Simpsons\" (2002–03). American actor Kelsey Grammer guest starred in the episode, returning to voice the recurring character Sideshow Bob. Since season three's \"Black Widower\" (1992), the writers have echoed the premise of Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner from the 1949–1966 \"Looney Tunes\" cartoons by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life and attempt to kill him. Executive producer Al Jean has compared Bob's character to that of Wile E. Coyote, noting that both are intelligent, yet always foiled by what they perceive as an inferior intellect.\n\nThis is one of the first episodes of \"The Simpsons\" that were animated with digital ink and paint, and marked the series' permanent switch to that technique. Previously, episodes had been animated using the traditional ink-and-paint process. Digital ink and paint had previously been used by the animators of \"The Simpsons\" for season 7's \"Radioactive Man\" and season 12's \"Tennis the Menace\", primarily to test the technique.\n\nThe episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 15, 2002. It was viewed in approximately 8.75 million households that night. With a Nielsen rating of 8.2, the episode finished 23rd in the ratings for the week of December 9–15, 2002. It was the highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week, beating shows such as \"King of the Hill\", \"Malcolm in the Middle\", \"24\", \"That '70s Show\", and the 2002 Billboard Music Awards. On December 6, 2011, \"The Great Louse Detective\" was released on Blu-ray and DVD as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Fourteenth Season\". Staff members Matt Groening, Al Jean, John Frink, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, Tim Long, Michael Price, Tom Gammill, Steven Dean Moore, Mike B. Anderson, and David Silverman, as well as cast member Dan Castellaneta, participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included in the box set.\n\nThe episode has received generally positive reviews from critics. In 2009, \n\nIGN's Robert Canning listed \"The Great Louse Detective\" at number seven on his list of the \"Top 10 Sideshow Bob Episodes\". At that time, ten episodes revolving around the character had aired. Canning wrote that the episode \"was a lot of fun as it put Bob in an unexpected situation with the Simpsons, interacting more with Homer than with Bart.\" He added that the episode \"is also memorable for having Homer's attempted murderer turn out to be Frank Grimes Jr., son of Frank 'Grimey' Grimes. This was a nice reference to 'Homer's Enemy' and was a rare instance where the series carried through some continuity.\" \n\nDVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that \"Over the years, we’ve gotten many a great Sideshow Bob episode, so this one has to live up to steep competition. While not a bad show, 'Louse' fails to live up to its predecessors. It does throw out some good moments, and it’s fine by Season 14 standards, but it doesn’t qualify as a Sideshow Bob classic.\"\n\n"}

This piano suite is usually considered Granados's crowning creation and was inspired by the paintings of Francisco Goya, although the piano pieces have not been authoritatively associated with any particular paintings. The suite forms part of the standard Romantic piano repertoire.\n\nThe piano writing of \"Goyescas\" is highly ornamented and extremely difficult to master, requiring both subtle dexterity and great power. Some of them have a strong improvisational feel, the clearest example of this being the fifth piece, called \"El amor y la muerte\" (\"Love and Death\"). The fourth piece in the series (\"Quejas, ó la maja y el ruiseñor\"—\"The Maiden and the Nightingale\") is the best known piece from the suite. It resembles a nocturne, but is filled with intricate figuration, inner voices and, near the end, glittering bird-like trills and quicksilver arpeggios. Mexican songwriter Consuelo Velázquez based her 1940 song \"Bésame Mucho\" on this melody.\n\nThis piano suite was written in two books. Work on \"Goyescas\" began in 1909, and by 31 August 1910, the composer was able to write that he had composed \"great flights of imagination and difficulty.\" Granados himself gave the première of Book I at the Palau de la Música Catalana in Barcelona on 11 March 1911.

He is best known for his bestselling book on Lenny Bruce and his controversial biographies of Elvis Presley and John Lennon.\n\nAlbert Goldman was born in Dormont, Pennsylvania, and raised in Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania.\n\nGoldman briefly studied theater at the Carnegie Institute of Technology before serving in the U.S. Navy from 1945 to 1946. He earned a master's degree in English from the University of Chicago in 1950; under the chancellery of Robert Maynard Hutchins, students who were not enrolled in the generalist \"Chicago Plan\" undergraduate degree program were designated as master's students and received the higher degree after five years of study.\n\nUpon matriculating in the English doctoral program at Columbia University, Goldman began to teach literature courses at several institutions in New York City, including the City College of New York, Hunter College, Baruch College, Brooklyn College, the School of Visual Arts and the Columbia University School of General Studies. During this period, he first became acquainted with Lenny Bruce through his wife, Florence Singer, who introduced her husband to New York's vibrant jazz scene before going on to \"re-raise [Goldman] as a hip Brooklyn Jew\" along with her family and friends throughout his doctoral studies, effectively planting the seeds for his later interest in popular culture. Following studies under Lionel Trilling and Jacques Barzun, he completed his Ph.D. in 1961 with a dissertation on Thomas de Quincey. Goldman argued that de Quincey had plagiarized most of his acclaimed journalism from lesser-known writers; the dissertation was subsequently published as a monograph (\"The Mine and the Mint: Sources for the Writings of Thomas DeQuincey\") by Southern Illinois University Press in 1965. He also co-edited \"Wagner on Music and Drama\" (1964), a compendium of Richard Wagner's theoretical writings.\n\nAfter taking his doctorate, Goldman remained affiliated with Columbia, where he was an adjunct associate professor of English and comparative literature from 1963 to 1972; among his course offerings was the University's first class on popular culture. A close friend of Philip Roth, Goldman reportedly inspired the character of libidinous academic David Kepesh, notably showcased by Roth in such works as \"The Breast\" (1972) and \"The Professor of Desire\" (1977).\n\nIn the 1960s, Goldman began to publish a diverse array of reportage and cultural criticism (running the gamut from travel writing on the Rhine to reviews of classical music and popular music) in a variety of publications, including \"The Atlantic\", \"The New Leader\", \"Commentary\", \"The New Republic\", \"The New York Review of Books\", \"The Nation\", \"LIFE\", \"New York\", \"Vogue\", \"Esquire\", \"High Times\" and \"Penthouse\". Many of his early writings on popular culture were collected in \"Freakshow: The RockSoul BluesJazzSickJew BlackHumorSexPopPsychoGig and Other Scenes from the Counter-Culture\" (1971), which also served as the textbook for the later iterations of his Columbia popular culture course.\n\nGoldman's breakthrough success, \"Ladies and Gentlemen – Lenny Bruce!!\" (1974), won praise from the likes of Norman Mailer and Pauline Kael, who called the book \"brilliant.\" The book was largely positive in its appraisal of Bruce's talent, though it was criticized by many of Bruce's friends for allegedly distorting his character and for claims that Bruce had had homosexual experiences.\n\nGoldman's critical 1981 biography \"Elvis\" was much more controversial. In this book, Goldman drew on more than four years' research into Elvis Presley's life. But for many fans and some critics, his research was undermined by his intense personal dislike of Presley. \n\nGoldman dismissed the performer as a plagiarist who never did anything of note after his first records at Sun Records, insisting that he was inferior as an artist to Little Richard and other contemporaries. He also portrayed Presley as nearly insane, using stories that some might see as innocuous (such as Presley taking his friends halfway across the country to buy them peanut-butter sandwiches) to \"prove\" that the singer had lost his grip on reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the book includes several newly discovered facts. For instance, in the course of his research, Goldman discovered that Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, was not a Southerner but a native of the Netherlands. Parker had successfully covered this up to the degree that Presley himself allegedly never learned of it. (The book is harshest on Parker out of all the figures in Presley's life with whom it deals.) Furthermore, the book critically deals with the singer's weight problems, his diet, his choice of performing costumes, and his sexual appetites and peculiarities. Goldman even suggests that Presley's promiscuity masked latent homosexuality. Discussing Presley's personal life, Goldman concludes: \"Elvis was a pervert, a voyeur.\" Some critics found comments like these overly biased and judgmental. \n\nDefending himself against his critics, Goldman told an interviewer: \"People were scandalized by my use of humor and ridicule in (the Elvis biography). Elvis was someone they were accustomed to taking in a very sentimental way. But I feel he was a figure of the most bizarre and grotesque character. . . . The humor is a mode of perception. Of making things vivid.\"\n\nIn 1982, Goldman wrote a very unflattering article on actor Bruce Lee which was published in two parts by \"Penthouse\" in January–February 1983.\n\nIn 1990, Goldman published a second book, entitled \"Elvis: The Last 24 Hours\", on the circumstances and events of Presley's death, arguing that the singer had committed suicide. The book drew some attention for its sensational thesis but was largely ignored.\n\nGoldman's next biography arguably aroused even more controversy than the Elvis biography. In \"The Lives of John Lennon\", a product of years of research and hundreds of interviews with many of Lennon's friends, acquaintances, servants and musicians, Goldman describes John Lennon as both talented and neurotic. The book reveals a very personal side of the musician who was prone to faults, such as anger, violence, drug abuse, adultery, and indecisiveness, but who was also a generational leader. It deals with Lennon's childhood and the impact others had on the life of the sensitive little boy, among them his aunt, Mimi Smith, his father, Fred Lennon, and Johnny Dykins. Goldman implies that strong women ruined Lennon, starting with Smith, and that he was later being held prisoner by his wife, Yoko Ono.\n\nFocusing on the mistakes Lennon made and mean things he did, Goldman made many controversial allegations, among them the charge that he may have had something to do with the sudden death of his friend Stuart Sutcliffe, an early member of The Beatles. (Sources other than Goldman's book reported the cause of death as a brain hemorrhage.) Goldman also says that Lennon had a homosexual affair with The Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, whom Goldman characterizes as a dishonest, incompetent businessman who hid behind the image of a \"gentleman\". Half of the book covers the personality of Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono, who is portrayed in a very bad light. Goldman alleges that, among other things, she hated Paul McCartney, arranged for customs officials at a Tokyo airport to search carefully his luggage upon his arrival there eleven months before Lennon's death and to arrest him for smuggling marijuana, neglected her children, brainwashed Lennon and pulled him away from everyone who ever meant something to him. Goldman also alleged that the two carried on constant extramarital affairs throughout their marriage, with Ono involved in one during the summer of 1980. Goldman substantially revealed that no record exists of the phone calls Ono claims to have made to McCartney and Mimi Smith the night Lennon was murdered.\n\nConcerning Goldman's account of Lennon's consumption of LSD, Luc Sante, in \"The New York Review of Books\", said: \"Goldman's background research was either slovenly or nonexistent.\" The author replied: \nGoldman died of a heart attack on March 28, 1994, while flying from Miami to London. He left unfinished a biography of Doors singer Jim Morrison.\n\nThree years before his death, \"Penthouse\" published a long excerpt from his work-in-progress on Morrison. The excerpt focused on documents that Goldman claimed to have obtained from the Paris Police Prefecture regarding the minor police investigation that had been conducted in response to Morrison's wife Pamela Courson's notification that he had died suddenly at the apartment they were renting. According to Goldman, Courson provided a detailed account of the activities she and Morrison had done together throughout the day and night of Friday, July 2, 1971. They included setting up a movie projector and screening their Super 8 film home movies that they had made during a recent trip to Spain.\n\nAccording to Goldman, Courson seemingly gave police the whole truth about the early-morning hours of Saturday, except that she carefully refrained from admitting that either of them had used narcotics. According to Goldman, she even admitted that Morrison had vomited blood extensively and she grabbed a series of pots from their kitchen to catch all of it, and police believed her claim that this had happened in the middle of the night without the deceased, age 27, being under the influence of narcotics or alcohol.\n\nGoldman's biography of Morrison was never published, nor did a publication other than \"Penthouse\" refer to the alleged contents of Paris Police Prefecture documents related to Morrison and Courson. Goldman's obituary in the \"Los Angeles Daily News\" treated his Morrison project with contempt. Phil Rosenthal, then a writer with the Daily News, opined, \"At the time of his death, he was picking over Jim Morrison's bones for yet another book.\" Rosenthal did not go into detail.\n\nU2 lead singer Bono referenced his disdain for Goldman in the song \"God Part II\" from the album \"Rattle and Hum\":\n\nThe American television program \"Saturday Night Live\" had a season-14 sketch in which it was revealed that Albert Goldman, portrayed by Phil Hartman, was the fifth member of the Beatles, and played the trombone. The band, supported by Elvis Presley, decides to fire Goldman—a task they leave to John Lennon, with Elvis backing him up. This ostensibly fueled Goldman's lifelong hatred of the two.\n\nSinger-satirist Mojo Nixon makes a scornful reference to Goldman in his 1989 single, \"(619) 239-KING\", which parodied the rumours that Presley was still alive by inviting the singer to call what was, at the time of release, a legitimate phone number.\n\n\n"}

The play is filled with profanity and regional jargon that reflects the working-class language of Chicago. The characters' relationships come to be hindered by the caustic nature of their words, as much of the dialogue includes insults and arguments. The play presents \"intimate relationships [as] minefields of buried fears and misunderstandings\".\n\nThe play has been adapted for film twice: as the 1986 film \"About Last Night\" and the 2014 film \"About Last Night\".\n\n\nScene: Various spots around the North Side of Chicago, a Big City on a Lake.\nTime: Approximately nine weeks one summer.\n\nDanny and Bernie balance their mundane office jobs with sexual banter, particularly their experiences and preferences in the bedroom. Likewise, Joan and Deborah frequently discuss the shortcomings of men while at their apartment.\n\nThe main plot point is Danny and Deborah's relationship, perpetuating much of the dialogue about men and women. Their romance is quickly established by sexual attraction, but as the play progresses and Deborah moves into Danny's apartment, they are unable to talk with each other seriously. Danny complains in frustration, \"Everything's fine. Sex, talk, life, everything. Until you want to get 'closer', to get 'better'. Do you know what the fuck you want?\" Eventually, the couple breaks up while Danny and Bernie revert to their usual talk about \"broads\" and what is wrong with the world.\n\nJoan says,\n\nAn early version of \"Sexual Perversity in Chicago\" was first produced at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont by the members of St. Nicholas Theater. The production was directed by Mamet.\n\nThe play was a series of blackouts showing various people (waitresses, policemen, investment bankers) having discussions about sex. It featured:\n\n\nThe play was subsequently reworked by Mamet with director Stuart Gordon into the four character structure that made it famous and established David Mamet as a playwright. An earlier Mamet play, \"Danny Shapiro and his Search for the Mystery Princess\", was combined with \"Sexual Perversity\", adding the characters of Bernie Litko and Joan Webber. It was produced and performed by Organic Theater Company in Chicago in June 1974 in a production directed by Stuart Gordon. The cast featured:\n\n\nIn December 1975, the play was mounted off-off Broadway at the St. Clements Theatre in New York. An off-Broadway production directed by Albert Takazauckas opened on a double bill with the playwright's \"The Duck Variations\" on June 16, 1976 at the Cherry Lane Theatre in Greenwich Village and ran for 273 performances. The cast included F. Murray Abraham and Peter Riegert. Subsequent cast members included Jeff Zinn.\n\nJake Johannsen first thought of being a comedian when trying out for the Iowa State production of \"Sexual Perversity in Chicago\" in the early 1980s.\n\nIn 1980, the play was mounted at the Blancs-Manteaux Theatre in Paris, with Daniel Russo and Nathalie Courval.\n\nIn 2003, Matthew Perry made his stage debut in a West End production co-starring Minnie Driver, Hank Azaria, and Kelly Reilly.\n\nDirected by Ondřej Sokol. The play had premiered on 18 March 2004 in The Drama Club, Prague.\n\n\nDavid De Silva bought the motion picture rights to \"Sexual Perversity In Chicago\" and went with David Mamet on Mamet's first trip to Hollywood, to meet with Michael Eisner, head of Paramount Pictures, regarding doing a film version of the play. Eisner was very enthusiastic about the project, but Mamet ultimately was not able to deliver an acceptable screenplay to the studio. Years later, De Silva sold the film rights to a Chicago producer, Stuart Oken. Oken produced the 1986 film, \"About Last Night\", directed by Edward Zwick, with Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Jim Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins in the cast. The screenplay was written by Tim Kazurinsky and Denise Declue. The title change resulted from many newspapers refusing to advertise a movie with the original title.\n\nMamet disavowed the movie, ruefully recalling that \"as a callow youth with hay sticking out of my ears, I sold both the play and the screenplay for about $12 and a mess of porridge...\"\n\nA second film adaptation, also based on the 1986 film and again titled \"About Last Night\", was released in 2014. This film had an African-American cast and was set in Los Angeles. The film starred Kevin Hart, Michael Ealy, Regina Hall and Joy Bryant.\n"}

His father was a musician who played professionally including stints with the Charlie Spivak orchestra. He started playing the alto saxophone at age 13, studied with Phil Woods at a summer music camp, and took private lessons with Ira Sullivan.\n\nIn 1973, at the age of 21, Mover was a sideman for Charles Mingus for a five-month period at New York City’s 5 Spot Café. By 1975 Mover was working regularly in New York City jazz clubs with Chet Baker and he made his first European appearances with Baker at La Grande Parade du Jazz in (Nice, France), Jazz Festival Laren (the Netherlands), and the Middelheim Jazz Festival (Antwerp, Belgium).\n\nIn late 1975, Mover started leading his own groups around the New York area, and made his first two recordings as a leader in 1976 and 1977: \"On the Move\" (on the Choice label) and \"Bob Mover\" (Vanguard). Regular weekly gigs at the Sweet Basil in Greenwich Village featured prestigious sidemen such as Tom Harrell, Jimmy Garrison, Kenny Barron, Albert Dailey, Ben Riley, Mike Nock and Ron McLure.\n\nMover rejoined Chet Baker in 1981 for a European tour, playing in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Cologne, Germany, where they made the recordings \"Chet Baker Live at Club Salt Peanuts Koln\", Volumes 1 and 2 (Circle).\n\nMover recorded two more albums as a leader in 1981 and 1982, \"In the True Tradition\" and \"Things Unseen\", both issued by Xanadu and both of which rated five stars in the \"All Music Guide to Recorded Jazz\".\n\nIn 1983, Bob moved to Montreal and taught at Concordia University. Three years later, in 1986, he recorded his fifth album as leader, \"The Nightbathers\" with pianist Paul Bley and guitarist John Abercrombie, which was an experiment in free improvisation. From 1987 to 1997, Mover lived in Toronto and became a fixture of the Toronto jazz scene, also touring Europe with pianists Walter Davis Jr. and Tony Castillano. Together with Don Thompson and Archie Alleyne, Mover helped found the Toronto Jazz Quartet, a pianoless four-piece working band that played in and around the Toronto area including bars such as the Rex Hotel, Quigley's and the Pilot Tavern. He accepted a teaching position at York University, giving saxophone masterclasses and teaching a course he created called \"Musicianship for Jazz Singers\". During this period, in 1988 Walter Davis Jr. featured Bob on four tracks of his CD \"Illumination\" (Pony Canyon/Jazz City) with Ron Carter and Kenny Washington. The same year, Mover released another album as leader on the same label called \"You Go to My Head\" with Rufus Reid, Benny Green, Victor Lewis and Steve Hall.\n\nHe released an album recorded in Montreal in 1997 called \"Television\" (DSM) featuring John Hicks and Jake Wilkinson.\n\nHis latest release is 'It Amazes Me' on Zoho music which includes sidemen Kenny Barron and Reg Schwager.\n\nMover has an explosive sound and style on the sax, directly influenced by Charlie Parker, Lee Konitz, Ira Sullivan, Stan Getz, and Sonny Rollins.

She was also billed as \"Morganna the Wild One\" when appearing as a dancer in the 1980s.\n\nMorganna famously rushed the field on many occasions and kissed Major League Baseball players including Nolan Ryan, Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, George Brett (twice), Steve Garvey, Len Barker and Cal Ripken, Jr. She has been described as \"baseball's unofficial mascot\" and \"the grand dame of baseball\". She also crashed National Basketball Association games, where Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was one of her most notable victims.\n\nMorganna Roberts was born in Louisville, Kentucky. She was a baseball fan from a young age, as her grandfather took her to see the Louisville team. She grew up in a poor family; her mother Jane disowned Morganna as a baby, which led to her grandmother Virginia's taking care of Morganna for six years. Morganna was then sent to Mount Mercy Catholic Boarding School just outside Louisville. She initially wanted to be a nun but ran away from the school at age 13, hitchhiking with a friend to Baltimore, where she begged shop owners for a job while living on the street and eating out of garbage cans. She was unable to find work because she was too young to get a work permit.\n\nAfter a month, Morganna came across an ad in the window of the Flamingo Club for a \"Cigarette Girl or Camera Girl. Must be 18\". She told the owner she was 18, and he quickly decided she would be better employed as an exotic dancer. Morgana had no idea what that was but said yes, thinking \"it had something to do with a camel and veils\". Her first appearance on stage did not go well; she could not walk in her high heels, and as she danced, the men in the audience kept shouting \"Take it off\". Thinking they were referring to her, she burst into tears and had to be led off the stage by the manager. After watching some of the other performers, however, she soon got the hang of it and was a well-established and successful exotic dancer by the time she was 17. Her act combined stripping with comedy, wearing two 10 gallon cowboy hats on her chest and impersonating the film critic Gene Shalit. She avoided singing, however, as \"when I sing, people think the place is being raided.\"\n\nShe attracted particular attention for what the writer Hank Davis describes as \"her ample physical development. Simply put, the woman makes Dolly Parton look developmentally delayed\". She gave her measurements as , which she referred to as her \"baseball stats\". She frequently quipped that Parton was \"flat-chested\" compared to her. Morganna's famously well-endowed physique began developing when she was only nine and, according to her, by the time she was 12 she could pass for 18. She had to wear I cup bras, costing $50 each and custom-made by a firm in Columbus, Ohio: \"People ask me where I get my bras and I always tell them the same people who make my bras made the domes for all the stadiums.\" She also had to spend $45 a month on aerobics classes to help strengthen her back to take the weight of what she called her \"stage props.\" Nonetheless, she insisted: \"I'm not a sex symbol. I'm a comedienne. I make folks smile. I make them laugh - and that makes my day. What are we here for, if not that?\"\n\nHer on-field career began in August, 1969 when she rushed onto the field at Crosley Field, Cincinnati and kissed Reds player Pete Rose. She was prompted by a friend who \"dirty-double-dared me to do it. Where I'm from, you don't turn down a dirty-double-dare... at least, not when you're a teenager.\" Rose reacted with \"terrible language\" but the next night he tracked her down \"to the local nightspot where I was appearing and apologized with a bunch of roses.\" She obtained the nickname \"the Kissing Bandit\" from a Cincinnati sportswriter who announced her arrival with the headline: \"Bandit steals kiss from Pete Rose.\"\n\nOver the following years, Morganna became a familiar sight at baseball fields, basketball courts, and hockey rinks. By 1990, she had kissed 37 Major League Baseball players, 12 National Basketball Association players, and dozens of minor league baseball, basketball, and hockey players, plus various umpires, managers, and owners, and, on one occasion, The San Diego Chicken. She confined herself to kissing them on the cheek, commenting: \"It's more sanitary than the lips, and that way their wives don't get upset. Besides, who wants tobacco stains all over your teeth?\" On one occasion, one of her \"victims\" got his own back. Three weeks after Morganna had kissed George Brett, as he prepared to bat against the Baltimore Orioles, Brett marched onto the stage during Morganna's performance and, to the cheers of the crowd, gave her a kiss of her own. Few players seemed to mind being kissed by her; Kelly Tripucka of the Detroit Pistons famously commented, \"It was like hugging a mattress. When I saw her coming at me, I thought it was like a Mack truck. I had two options – either get hit or get out of the way. I decided to get hit.\"\n\nHer pastime was not without its hazards, however; she was beaten by security guards in Cincinnati, suffered various injuries jumping from stands onto playing fields, and was hit by a pitch in Milwaukee. She was arrested and charged with trespassing nearly 20 times and was jailed briefly in Anaheim, California. She also stood trial in Houston, Texas, where her lawyer used what he called the \"gravity defense\" to explain her unauthorized presence on the field, arguing: \"This woman with a body and chest leaned over the rail to see a foul ball. Gravity took its toll, she fell out on the field, and the rest is history.\" The judge laughed and dismissed the case. Despite the arrests and fines, her fame earned Morganna millions of dollars.\n\nMorganna's involvement with baseball extended to being the star of her own set of bubblegum cards and becoming the part-owner of a minor league club, the Utica Blue Sox. On one occasion she gave them a pep talk when they were 15-7 down and in last place; they went on to win 40 of the next 54 games. She endorsed the \"Morganna Kissing Bandit peanuts\" brand from Carolina Fine Snacks, which expected a doubling of its sales as a result. She even got featured in a display at the Baseball Hall of Fame, where a picture of her attempting to kiss Frank Howard was put on display. Her popularity with baseball fans grew to the point that minor-league clubs began inviting her to kiss their players as a way of drumming up publicity. The Boise Hawks went further, getting her to enter the field by bungee jumping from a crane, then persuading CNN to feature her jump as its \"play of the day\". Her appearances proved to be extremely popular, consistently doubling average attendances.\n\nOff the field, Morganna worked as an entertainer, doing comedy and dancing. She worked regularly as an exotic dancer in Houston, Las Vegas, and Oklahoma City, sometimes earning as much as $7,000 to $10,000 a week. She was occasionally hired to publicize events, making personal appearances and giving speeches at places such as car shows and trade conventions. She also dabbled with television, appearing on Johnny Carson and David Letterman's late-night talk shows and occasionally hosting \"Good Morning, Columbus\", a local TV talk show. Morganna appeared as the mystery guest in a 1978 episode of the game show, \"To Tell the Truth\".\n\nShe appeared in \"Playboy\" magazine, in the June 1983, April 1985, and September 1989 issues. During the 1990s, she occasionally kissed minor league players. Her last notable appearance before retirement was in the Farrelly brothers' feature film \"Kingpin\" (1996), in which she appeared as herself.\n\nShe is the subject of the biopic documentary, \"Morganna: The Kissing Bandit\", directed by Emmy-winning producer Martin Khodabakhshian, which aired September 26, 2014 on ESPN.\n\nShe appeared in an obscure ChoiceMark Corp. VHS tape named \"Sports Blooper Mania\" in 1989, where she hosted/presented many sports bloopers that had been captured on film; and during the tape, an ongoing storyline developed where the viewer had to keep watching to find out who she would kiss next, as she claimed she was planning to kiss someone at an ongoing ball game, as she is famous for. Morganna ended up kissing Charles Barkley, who, at the time, played for the Philadelphia 76ers. As part of the plotline, she interrupted the game, kissed Barkley, and got arrested afterward.\n\nAt age 22, Morganna married Bill Cottrell, an accountant from Columbus, Ohio. The two met at a World Series game where he offered to help her with her taxes. Six months later, they got engaged; Morganna joked, \"This man is saving you money. Better marry him!\"\n\nShe has a son, Nick.\n\nMorganna retired at the end of 1999 and now lives in Ohio. She no longer grants interviews, but made an exception for the 50th anniversary by giving a phone interview with USA TODAY, stating that there would not be a comeback tour.\n\n"}

The play depicts a discussion taking place between two elderly men sitting on a park bench watching ducks. The dialogue begins with the mating habits of ducks and runs to examine law, friendship and death. The principal irony is that the men really know nothing about ducks. If they did, it would not improve their beautiful fugue on the theme of the possibility of happiness. Rather they use what experience has taught them and scattered, possibly incorrect ideas and facts to make guesses. They each assure the other that their guesses are established fact. By argument and occasional agreement a composite view of ducks and by extension, the world, begins to emerge.\n\nThe play is focused around two old men who randomly meet on a park bench. Although it is usually played that the two men do not know of each other, (the stage directions are ambiguous—they could meet, or they could be old friends) they awkwardly begin to talk to each other. As they fumble for topics to speak upon, somehow they always end up reverting to the ducks swimming around in the lake. Although their conversations seem misguided, as they talk about the ducks, many wise conversations are actually discussed. They talk about the leader of the ducks, and how every other duck follows that leader. When the leader duck dies, then a new leader must be chosen. They also talk about how everything the ducks do has a purpose. Within the dialog of the men, they talk about why things occur naturally, friendship, and death, not only in reference to the ducks, but also in human nature.\n\nThe play was initially performed in 1972 at the Saint Nicholas Theatre, directed by Mamet. \n\nThe double bill of \"Sexual Perversity in Chicago,\" and \"The Duck Variations\" was produced Off-Broadway at the Cherry Lane Theatre, from June 16, 1976\nto April 17, 1977. The plays won the 1976 Obie Award, Best New American Play.\n\nThe play was presented at the Kirk Douglas Theatre, Los Angeles in 2008, as part of a program titled \"Two Unrelated Plays by David Mamet,\" starring Harold Gould as Emil and Michael Lerner as George. According to Charles McNulty (theatre critic), \"The Duck Variations,\" about seniors and death, is often paired with \"Sexual Perversity in Chicago,\" about young adults and sex.\n"}

Mordred also seemed to believe that use of the \"Darkhold\" would grant him sufficient strength to challenge Merlin himself.\n\nHumans first found the \"Darkhold\" during the time before Atlantis sank into the ocean. When Kull slew Thulsa Doom, Doom's followers, the Darkholders, used the Darkhold to create the first vampire, Varnae, dying due to wounds suffered in battle with Kull. Varnae consumed one of the Darkholders who attempted to command him, and began creating other vampires. Some surviving Darkholders managed to make off with the \"Darkhold\" before Atlantis sank.\n\nWhen Atlantis sank, Varnae went into hibernation and did not revive until circa 10,000 BC. He found that some parchments of the \"Darkhold\" had been left behind in the Flaming Mountains of Khorasha. Varnae attempted to recover these parchments, now bound into \"The Iron-Bound Book Of Skelos.\" In an altercation with Conan, Red Sonja, and the sorcerer Zula, Varnae controlled bat-like humanoids called the Afterlings. Zula used a spell from the \"Darkhold\"/Chthon Scrolls against Varnae, reciting, \"Shemek Iref Wenek Tjhen Inek It-Ek Chthon Djedeni Emm-Maat Wenen Taeei Hemet Ankh-Ek Isheset Antioo Djedte Nes Sep Iree Nen Renek Anhkhu Wi-Im Valka!\" He then noted, \"I'm sorry the incantation ended where it did--and only hurt Lord Varnae, rather than destroying him.\" To Zula, the words appeared in Stygian, but it had long been known that Chthon had cast a spell that would make the Darkhold appear intelligible in any language. In any event, Varnae fled.\n\nZula also used the \"Darkhold\" against the Set-worshipping sorcerer Thugra Khothan. Later Red Sonja and Zula traveled to Zamboula, Zamboula serving as the western part of the Turanian empire. Totrasmek, the priest of the deity Hanuman (note that Hindus also worship a simian deity called Hanuman), came into possession of the Chthon Scroll/Darkhold. Totramesk had been searching for years for the Darkhold. Zula recovered the Darkhold and used the scrolls to transport himself and Sonja away. Zula noted that the scroll disappeared as a result of the spell.\n\nLater historians in the Vatican would note that at some point scrolls of the Darkhold were taken East during the Hyborian Age.\n\nAfter the Hyborian Age, Egyptians, Babylonians, and Hebrews came to possess the \"Darkhold\" scrolls. Morgan le Fay bound the scrolls into book form for the first time circa the 7th century. It is around this time they were translated from Chthon's arcane script into Latin. Saint Brendan tore them up. Numerous pages from the \"Darkhold\" have been scattered across the globe by cults of Chthon-worshipping Darkholders. The usage of a page of the \"Darkhold\" would summon the Darkhold Dwarf, a minion or manifestation of Chthon, who would attempt to manipulate and corrupt the page's invoker.\n\nIn the 12th century, a heretical monk named Aelfric had reformed the \"Darkhold\". This monk was burnt at the stake, the \"Darkhold\" with him. The \"Darkhold\" reformed itself, and was purchased by a trader, who was then murdered. By the 17th century, the Vatican came to possess the \"Darkhold\". Dracula sent a thief to acquire it for him, but Cagliostro slew the thief and took it for himself.\n\nAt some point the vampire Lord Ruthven may have possessed the \"Darkhold\".\n\nThe \"Darkhold\" was also responsible for the curse of the werewolf; an 18th-century man named Grigori Russoff had been tainted by the \"Darkhold\", and was subsequently bitten by a werewolf who served Dracula. Grigori passed this curse of lycanthropy on to his descendants, including eventually Gregor Russoff and his son Jacob Russoff. Taboo, the sorcerer, claims to have found the \"Darkhold\" in an old Balkan castle. He used to taunt Gregor Russoff with a possible cure.\n\nGregor Russoff came to possess the \"Darkhold\". He would later copy much of its content into the journal of his ancestor, and used it as a journal for himself. Accounts vary as to how he came to possess it. Some say he purchased it, while others say he took it from the sorcerer Taboo. Two accounts say that Russoff bought it. In any event, when he read of the origin of lycanthropy in the \"Darkhold\", Gregor Russoff (whose ancestor Grigori had been a werewolf) also contracted lycanthropy. During this time, Dracula shadowed Russoff.\n\nGregor Russoff attempted to raise Chthon hoping he could cure him of lycanthropy. Chthon instead apparently struck Russoff dead, though Russoff evidently somehow revived. The High Evolutionary and Magnus managed to defeat Chthon at this point. Presumably, the revived Gregor Russoff recovered the \"Darkhold\" and somehow managed to hide his activities from the High Evolutionary and Magnus for some time. He was later slain by villagers no earlier than approximately 20 years ago.\n\nLater, Russoff's son Jack also became a werewolf. Recovering the \"Darkhold\" from Miles Blackgar, he gave it to a Father Jacquez to translate. Aelfric's ghost possessed Jacquez. At the end of this struggle, Russoff incorrectly thought that the Darkhold was destroyed. Later, Russoff traveled to Transylvania with the Indian woman Topaz to visit Russoff Manor. There they found Gregor Russoff's diary. Dracula came to possess the diary, but he left it behind in a blizzard in the Alps once he learned that the diary contained a copy of the Montesi Formula to destroy vampires. Morgan Le Fay later recovered the diary.\n\nAt some point Doctor Doom found a part of the Darkhold that allowed him to cast a spell to access Belasco's Limbo. Also at some point, Mephisto imprisoned a demon called Darklove into a page of the \"Darkhold\".\n\nThe \"Darkhold\" played a role in the fifth \"Marvel Zombies\" series, specifically in the third issue. In this series, Machine Man and Howard the Duck (from the primary Marvel universe) and Jackie Kane (from Earth-483) travel between dimensions collecting samples of the various zombie viruses in order to develop a cure. In this issue, they travel to a universe which contains zombies dubbed \"Raimis\" (a reference to the \"Evil Dead\" films directed by Sam Raimi). In this universe, though, the zombies are controlled by the Darkhold rather than by the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, which is how they are controlled in the film series.\n\nCarnage was augmented by the Darkhold and was successful in resurrecting Chthon, but were defeated by the Symbiote Task Force (composed of John Jameson, Eddie Brock as Toxin, Claire Dixon and Jubil van Scotter).\n\nDuring the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, Baron Helmut Zemo used the Darkhold on Blackout in order to enhance his powers enough to have Darkforce shadows cover all of Manhattan.\n\nA group led by Victoria Montesi, the last member of the Montesi family, attempted to curtail the effects of the lost pages of the \"Darkhold\". The group starred in the series \"Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins\". Many pages of the \"Darkhold\" were being passed around by a demonic dwarf. The recipients of the page could use them to grant a wish at the cost of their soul; the wish tends to go horrifically wrong.\n\nA member of the Darkhold Redeemers. Professor Louise Hastings was an expert in the occult. She spent her career fighting occult or demonic forces, usually alongside her peers and the Midnight Sons. During the crisis known as the \"Midnight Massacre\" it was Hastings who saved the day by reading from the Darkhold, sacrificing her soul to Chthon. She was killed months later during the \"Siege of Darkness\" by Morbius who was possessed by Lilin blood. She is survived by her grandson, Jinx.\n\nLittle is known about Sam Buchanan. He is an Interpol agent who is assigned to protect Victoria Montesi after she barely survived an attack by a cult worshipping the \"Darkhold\". After Victoria Montesi disappears and Professor Hastings was murdered, Sam walked away from the occult. He is presumed back at Interpol.\n\nJinx is the grandson of Louise Hastings, an expert in the occult and a mystic of limited power. It is likely that her experiences in the mystic affected her lineage, although her daughter, Caprice, never demonstrated any mystical abilities. Jinx proved able to access magic to perform small feats without any sort of training. Jinx's mother was killed in a struggle over of the \"Darkhold\" pages, and he came to live with his grandmother, Louise. Almost instantly, he became caught up in a Darkhold plot to reassemble the pages. Sam Buchanan was an agent of Interpol and was convinced by his superior, DeGuzman, leader of a Darkholder sect, to betray and bring in the Darkhold Redeemers. Jinx followed Buchanan back to a base in the southwest, where he accessed the energy of a page of the Darkhold to disperse a group of guards and free Victoria Montesi.\n\nAn ally of the Darkhold Redeemers, Blade, was temporarily corrupted by a page of the Darkhold, becoming an incarnation of the Demogorge. Modred teleported Jinx back to New Hope to prevent him from being injured in the battle against the Demogorge.\n\nJinx accompanied the other Redeemers when they investigated Lt. Frank Walsh after he used the \"Troid\" spell of the Darkhold. Following this, Victoria Montesi accessed a page of the \"Darkhold\" to gain healing powers. This resulted in the summoning of the creature Monstrosity, which was drawn to follow Victoria and slaughter those it encountered. Jinx attempted to engage the Monstrosity, but was stabbed in the chest by it. He was mortally wounded, but Victoria appeared and used her magics to heal him instantly. It was at this time that Jinx began training as an apprentice to Modred, much to the consternation of the other Redeemers. Jinx demonstrated the ability to focus mystic energy from his right eye while directly participating in the struggle against Spider-X, another \"Darkhold\" page user.\n\nModred's training allowed Jinx to participate in the \"Siege of Darkness\", amplifying Modred's power to oppose the forces of the demon Lilith I. Internal strife and misunderstandings amongst the Midnight Sons did briefly turn Jinx against Modred, but they soon resolved this. Jinx accompanied the others to the jungles of Central America to locate the Blood member Truth-Sayer. They succeeded, although Truth-Sayer was incinerated by the Fallen member Metarchus. Following this, in order to protect him against the final battle against Lilith and Zarathos, Jinx was sent to the Vatican to remain under the care of Vittorio Montesi.\n\n\n"}

Ginastera composed the opera on commission from the Municipality of the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first performance was at the Teatro Colón, Buenos Aires, Argentina on 24 July 1964 with Carlo Cossutta in the title role. The production was directed by Jorge Petraglia and conducted by Bruno Bartoletti.\n\nOn February 22, 1966, Plácido Domingo had his international breakthrough by singing the title role of this opera at the US premiere of the work by the New York City Opera. Other cast members included Jeannine Crader as Florinda, Spiro Malas as Teudiselo, the king's tutor, and David Clatworthy as Don Julian, Florinda's father. Julius Rudel conducted, and the opera received 9 performances at New York City Opera. In November 1967 the production was also given, still with Plácido Domingo, on tour at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. Ginastera prepared from the opera a concert work for soprano and orchestra, which received its own first performance in October 1964.\n\nMalena Kuss has published a detailed study of Ginastera's use of motives and of Argentine musical idioms in the opera. Pola Suares Urtubey has published an analysis of the dramatic structure of the opera.\n\n\nThe setting is Toledo, Spain in the 8th century. A note is that Don Rodrigo is also the Spanish name for Roderic, the last Visigothic king of Spain. The three acts of the opera are divided into nine scenes linked by interludes, with labeling of the scenes as follows:\n\n\"Act I\"\n\n\"Act II\"\n\n\"Act III\"\n\nThe scenes mirror each other in a format resembling a dramatic palindrome, with Scene 1 mirrored in Scene 9, Scene 2 mirrored in Scene 8, and so on, with Scene 5 forming the dramatic climax and fulcrum of the story.\n\nAt the start, Don Rodrigo has avenged an attack on his father. He is then about to be crowned King of Spain. Don Julian, Governor of Ceuta in Africa, introduces the King to his daughter Florinda. Rodrigo promises Don Julian that he will look after her as a daughter if she is permitted to stay at the royal court. At the coronation of Rodrigo, Florinda drops the crown. Although some regard this accident as a baleful sign, Rodrigo then retrieves the crown and places it on his own head. Historically, a chest in the Vault of Hercules has contained a locked mystery, which every King of Spain has respected since ancient times. However, Rodrigo opens the locked chest, where he sees the secret in the form of an Arab flag and a curse. The curse states that he who has opened the chest will be the last of his dynasty and that the Arabs will enslave Spain.\n\nLater, Florinda bathes in a fountain, which Rodrigo sees. He goes to Florinda’s bedroom at night, and forces himself on her. Rodrigo then abandons her. Florinda writes to her father, angrily calling for revenge on Rodrigo. \n\nDon Julian raises a rebellion against Don Rodrigo. At the battle at Guadalete, Don Julian is victorious against Don Rodrigo, which allows the Moors to enter Spain, fulfilling that part of the curse. Rodrigo becomes a penniless vagrant, and eventually finds shelter with a blind hermit. Florinda eventually discovers Rodrigo there. Rodrigo confesses his sins, and finally dies in Florinda's embrace.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2022609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022609", "title": "County island", "text": "County island\n\nA county island is an unincorporated area within a county, usually, but not always, surrounded on all sides by another incorporated area, such as a city. On maps, these geopolitical anomalies will form jagged or complex borders and 'holes' in the city limits. Generally found more frequently in the western United States, county islands form in areas of expansion when previously smaller cities will annex and incorporate more land into their jurisdiction. If residents or landowners in a particular unincorporated area do not vote to incorporate with the surrounding city, the area remains unincorporated. The formation of a county island usually follows stages where it will come into being on the edge of an incorporated area, and as more territory is incorporated, be cut off from the rest of the unincorporated area within the county. These areas are not, by definition, exclaves because they are simply unincorporated within a surrounding city.\n\nResidents in county islands may resist annexation for a variety of reasons. Generally, people living on county islands have agricultural livelihoods which could come under threat if they incorporated; the risk of eminent domain seizure of their land is greater should they incorporate into a sprawling city that is quickly filling up all available land for development. Other times, the real estate of a county island is owned by one or a small number of owners who live elsewhere, and have no interest in annexation, or who intentionally hold onto the land inside a growing metropolitan area for the interest of land value going up drastically.\n\nBecause these patches of land are not incorporated into the city surrounding them, they usually fall under the jurisdiction of the county in which they are located. This can create problems if a county island is itself densely populated; they must rely on the parent county for services such as waste management, fire coverage and protection, as well as police: only county police or Sheriff have jurisdiction, or are the primary law enforcement within county islands. It is under debate frequently if the surrounding city should provide emergency services to these unincorporated areas. Other problems, such as dumping and other illegal activities that occur in county islands, can prove to be a blight on the surrounding areas.\n\nCounty islands are a common feature of the fast-growth communities in fast growing areas with incorporated communities such as the Phoenix and Tucson metro areas. By law, 51% of landowners in an area as well as the city must approve annexation before it can take place.\n\nSome county islands are populated places, such as Olive, which is surrounded by Orange. Another common kind of county islands are cemeteries, such as Greenwood Memorial Park, which is surrounded by San Diego.\n\nIn some cities with many county islands, such as Fresno and Bakersfield, the nearest fire station is dispatched to an incident regardless of city lines. Also, in these areas, both city police and county sheriff may respond to calls together, but the area they are in will determine who is primary officer and who will take the report.\n\nThe city of Glendale, Colorado, is one of two areas belonging to Arapahoe County, but surrounded by the City and County of Denver. The other such area, including the neighborhoods of Holly Hills and Holly Ridge, is located just east of I-25 between Iliff Avenue and Hampden Avenue. According to the definition established in the article, Glendale is not precisely a county island because it is a city in its own right. However, the Holly Hills area is a county island.\n\nAt the county level, both of these areas are true exclaves because they are portions of one county surrounded by another county.\n\nMount Greenwood Cemetery is completely surrounded by the city of Chicago but is incorporated into the neighboring suburb of Merrionette Park.\n\nMemphis surrounds the Bridgewater area of Shelby County, Tennessee, with I-40 as a north boundary, Whitten Rd. as a west boundary, Shelby Farms Park as a south boundary, and roughly Appling/Cordova Rd. as an east boundary. Memphis attempted to annex the entire area in the 2000s but decided to hold off because of a lack of funding and annexed only the portion between Appling Rd. and Germantown Pkwy.\n\nTwo county islands exist at the eastern end of Grand Prairie, Texas; the islands house a drag strip and a small speedway which the city has chosen not to annex (as per Texas law the city would then be required to provide law enforcement to them).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2022612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022612", "title": "Red River Campaign", "text": "Red River Campaign\n\nThe Red River Campaign or Red River Expedition comprised a series of battles fought along the Red River in Louisiana during the American Civil War from March 10 to May 22, 1864. The campaign was a Union initiative, fought between approximately 30,000 Union troops under the command of Major General Nathaniel P. Banks, and Confederate troops under the command of Lieutenant General Richard Taylor, whose strength varied from 6,000 to 15,000.\n\nThe campaign was primarily the plan of Union General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck, and a diversion from Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant's plan to surround the main Confederate armies by using Banks's Army of the Gulf to capture Mobile, Alabama. It was a Union failure, characterized by poor planning and mismanagement, in which not a single objective was fully accomplished. Taylor successfully defended the Red River Valley with a smaller force. However, the decision of Taylor's immediate superior, General Edmund Kirby Smith, to send half of Taylor's force north to Arkansas rather than south in pursuit of the retreating Banks after the Battle of Mansfield and the Battle of Pleasant Hill, led to bitter enmity between Taylor and Smith.\n\nThe Union had four goals at the start of the campaign:\nUnion strategists in Washington thought that the occupation of east Texas and control of the Red River would separate Texas from the rest of the Confederacy. Texas was the source of much needed guns, food, and supplies for Confederate troops.\n\nOther historians have claimed that the campaign was also motivated by concern regarding the 25,000 French troops in Mexico sent by Napoleon III and under the command of Emperor Maximilian. At the time, the Confederates offered to recognize the government of Maximillian in return for French recognition of the Confederacy; the Confederates also hoped to gain access to valuable war goods through this recognition. However, Banks's campaign on the Texas coast during November and December 1863 had satisfied President Abraham Lincoln, who wrote to Banks, \"My thanks for your successful and valuable operations in Texas.\"\n\nHalleck's plan, finalized in January 1864, called for Banks to take 20,000 troops up from New Orleans to Alexandria, including the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry, the only regiment from the Keystone State to fight in this campaign, on a route up the Bayou Teche (in Louisiana, the term bayou is used to refer to a slow moving river or stream), where they would be met by 15,000 troops sent down from Major General William T. Sherman's forces in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and under the command of Brigadier General A.J. Smith. Smith's forces were available to Banks only until the end of April, when they would be sent back east where they were needed for other Union military actions. Banks would command this combined force of 35,000, which would be supported in its march up the Red River towards Shreveport by Union Navy Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter's fleet of gunboats. At the same time, 7,000 Union troops from the Department of Arkansas under the command of Major General Frederick Steele would be sent south from Arkansas to rendezvous with Banks in his attack on Shreveport, and to serve as the garrison for that city after its capture.\n\nThis plan was ready to be set in action in early March 1864, after somewhat belated communication initiated by Banks to inform Sherman and Porter of their roles in Halleck's strategy. Banks sent Sherman, Halleck, and Porter a report prepared by Major David Houston clearly showing the near impossibility of maintaining an occupation in Shreveport and east Texas without major resources. Most of Banks' men, accompanied by a large, poorly trained, cavalry force would march north toward the middle river. Banks would allow cotton speculators to come along, and Porter was bringing barges to collect cotton as lucrative naval prizes.\n\nThe Confederate senior officers were confused as to whether the Red River; Mobile, Alabama; or coastal Texas was the primary Union target for the spring 1864 campaign. The commander of the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department, General Edmund Kirby Smith, nevertheless started moving many of his men to the Shreveport area.\n\nThe Union forces consisted of four elements, the first three of which worked together:\n\n1. Troops from the Department of the Gulf, commanded by Major General Banks, consisting of two infantry divisions from the XIII Corps, two infantry divisions from the XIX Corps, a cavalry division, and a brigade of US Colored Troops, in total approximately 20,000 men.\n\n2. 10,000 men from XVI Corps and XVII Corps from the Army of the Tennessee under A.J. Smith.\n\n3. The Mississippi flotilla of the US Navy, commanded by Admiral Porter, consisting of ten ironclads, three monitors, eleven tinclads, one timberclad, one ram, and numerous support vessels.\n\n4. 7,000 men under General Steele in the Department of Arkansas.\n\nConfederate forces consisted of elements from the Trans-Mississippi Department, commanded by E. Kirby Smith.\n\n1. The District of West Louisiana, commanded by Richard Taylor, contained approximately 10,000 men, consisting of two infantry divisions, two cavalry brigades and the garrison of Shreveport.\n\n2. The District of Arkansas, commanded by Sterling Price, contained approximately 11,000 men, consisting of three infantry divisions and a cavalry division. As the campaign began, Smith ordered two of Price's infantry divisions to move to Louisiana.\n\n3. The District of Indian Territory (Oklahoma), commanded by Samuel Maxey, contained approximately 4,000 men in three cavalry brigades.\n4. The District of Texas, commanded by John Magruder, 15,000 men, mostly cavalry. As the campaign began, Smith ordered Magruder to send as many men as he could. Over the course of the campaign almost 8,000 cavalry came from Texas to aid Taylor in Louisiana; however, it arrived slowly and not all together.\n\n5. The Confederate Navy based in Shreveport had the ironclad , the gunboat \"Cotton\", and the ram .\n\nMajor General William B. Franklin, commanding the advance divisions of Banks's Army of the Gulf, began his march from southern Louisiana on March 10. Meanwhile, A. J. Smith and his two corps traveled via boat from Vicksburg down to Simmesport. After an all-night march, Smith's men surprised and captured Fort de Russy on the Red River on March 14, capturing 317 Confederate prisoners and the only heavy guns available to the Confederates. This signaled the beginning of the campaign. Admiral Porter was then able to remove a giant raft blocking the river without much difficulty. Taylor was forced to retreat, abandoning Alexandria, Louisiana, and ceding south and central Louisiana to the Union forces.\n\nA.J. Smith's force arrived at Alexandria on March 20, 1864, intending to rendezvous with Banks's forces, under the immediate command of Franklin. However, Franklin did not arrive at Alexandria until March 25, 1864, and Banks himself, travelling separately from his troops, did not arrive at Alexandria until March 26, 1864. Banks' failure to arrive in a timely manner for his rendezvous with Smith was the first of many logistical miscues that caused much acrimony between Banks and his subordinates during the campaign. While he waited for Banks to arrive, Smith sent Brigadier General Joseph Mower on a successful mission to capture much of Taylor's cavalry and his outpost upriver from Alexandria at Henderson's Hill on March 21. Nearly 250 Confederates and a four-gun artillery battery were captured without a shot being fired.\n\nWhen he arrived at Alexandria, Banks found an important message waiting for him. Two weeks earlier, on March 12, 1864, General Ulysses S. Grant had been named General-in-Chief of the Union Army, replacing Halleck. In Grant's message, he told Banks it was \"important that Shreveport be taken as soon as possible,\" because A.J. Smith's command must be returned to Sherman by the middle of April, \"even if it leads to the abandonment of the main object of your expedition.\"\n\nKirby Smith had nearly 80,000 men to call upon, but was undecided where to move them to counter the three Union forces now known to be moving toward Shreveport. Taylor would never fight with more than 18,500 men throughout the entire campaign.\nBy March 31, Banks's men had reached Natchitoches, only 65 miles south of Shreveport. Franklin's men had been delayed most of a week by rain, but it had not mattered because Admiral Porter had a similar delay trying to get his heaviest gunboats over the falls at Alexandria, which was covered with mines because the river had failed to achieve its seasonal rise in water level. Porter had also spent time gathering cotton in the interior, and Banks had conducted an election in the interim. Taylor now stationed himself 25 miles northwest at Pleasant Hill, still with fewer than 20,000 men. Once Banks had assembled more supplies, he continued advancing a week later.\n\nConstant cavalry and naval skirmishing had been going on since March 21. On April 2, Brigadier General Albert Lindley Lee's division of Union cavalry collided with 1,500 arriving Confederate Texas cavalrymen. These Confederates would continue to resist any Union advance. Union intelligence, meanwhile, had determined that there were additional forces besides Taylor and the cavalry up the road from them. All of the senior Union officers expressed doubts that there would be any serious Confederate opposition, except for the naval flotilla. Banks' army followed Taylor and the cavalry into a dense pine forest area away from the river, probably to keep them in their front. Approaching Pleasant Hill, the Union army was excessively strung out due both to the existence of only a few camping areas with water and the lack of monitoring of the position of the rear elements. Taylor kept moving back toward Shreveport.\n\nHeavy cavalry fighting, often dismounted, had continued on April 7 at Wilson's Farm and Tenmile Bayou. On April 8, Lee boldly charged a small force of Confederate cavalry at the Moss Plantation, three miles south of Mansfield, Louisiana, and pushed the Confederate horsemen off Honeycutt Hill. Taylor had stationed one infantry division (led by Brigadier General Alfred Mouton) in the woods along the edge of the clearing just north of Honeycutt Hill and east of the road. Seeing this increase in enemy strength, Lee requested infantry support. Landram's 2,400-man division of the 13th Corps was sent to Lee's aid and deployed to face Mouton. Banks went to the front to see for himself. Meanwhile, Taylor brought up a second infantry division (Walker's) to the woods on the other side of the road in the middle of the day. The arrival of Walker's division gave Taylor a numerical edge – he had about 9,000 men; Banks had about 5,000 men. More significantly, the Union deployment was aligned to its right, facing Mouton, with only a cavalry brigade holding the left wing.\n\nTaylor had hoped to provoke Banks into attacking him, but following an artillery duel, he became convinced that the Union army was in disarray and would not attack. Around 4 p.m., Taylor ordered the attack to begin. Mouton led his infantry across an 800-yard wide field and attacked the Union right, formed behind a rail fence. While Mouton's assault was repulsed by Landram's infantry, Taylor advanced the rest of his entire line, including Walker's division, against the Union left. Walker's men brushed aside the lone cavalry brigade, sweeping in behind the rest of the Union forces. Banks had called for additional reinforcements, but they were too late. The Union line collapsed and a significant number of men from Landram's division were captured. A few hundred yards down the road, the reinforcements – Cameron's division – set up a second line, but this line also broke when faced with Taylor's superior numbers. The wagon train of the Union cavalry obstructed the road, resulting in the loss of artillery which could not be extracted in the retreat. However, Confederate soldiers halted to loot some of the Union wagons, giving Banks' troops needed time to fall back.\n\nAs Confederate command and control was reestablished for the pursuit, the men ran into a third Union force, under General William Emory, about 5,800 men sitting atop a ridge overlooking Chatman's Bayou. The Confederates pushed forward, but Emory's division repulsed attempts to take this location. However, the Union forces did not have control of the precious water in the bayou. During the night, Banks decided to withdraw back to Pleasant Hill because of lack of water and the desire to unite with A. J. Smith's men.\n\nThe Battle of Mansfield was over. The Federals suffered approximately 2,400 casualties, almost half of which were from Landram's division – two of his eight regiments were captured in the battle, and both of his brigade commanders were wounded and captured. The Confederates suffered about 1,000 casualties, including Mouton, who was killed leading his men in the opening charge.\n\nTaylor did not learn of Banks' retreat until dawn the next day; he then ordered an immediate pursuit with Brigadier General Thomas Green's cavalry. When they came upon Banks' line of battle near the town of Pleasant Hill, Taylor had the cavalry retreat a mile and wait for the infantry to arrive, which started arriving shortly after noon. Since the infantry had marched forty five miles in thirty-six hours, Taylor let them rest for two hours before ordering an attack.\n\nAt 4 p.m. the next day, Confederate Brigadier General Thomas J. Churchill's arriving infantry started the attack on the Union forces. Taylor thought he was sending them into the Union flank, but it was actually the center. Confederate cavalry also miscalculated positions and suffered heavily from flank fire. Churchill's men did succeed in collapsing this Union center position, but this also brought his men into the middle of a U-shaped position, with A. J. Smith's unused divisions forming the base of the \"U\". Though part of the advanced Union right had also collapsed, the forces of Smith and Mower next launched a counterattack, and joined by neighboring regiments, they routed Taylor's men from the vicinity of Pleasant Hill. Some cannon were recaptured.\n\nShort of water and feed for the horses, not knowing where his supply boats were, and receiving divided opinions from his senior officers, Banks ordered a rapid retreat downriver to Natchitoches and Grand Ecore. Both sides at the Battle of Pleasant Hill suffered roughly equal casualties of 1,600. It was a tactical victory for the Federals, but a strategic Confederate one because the Union army retreated following the battle.\n\nOn the river, the Confederates had diverted water into a tributary, causing the already low Red River level to fall further. When Admiral Porter, slowly heading upriver, learned that Banks was retreating, he followed suit. There was a brief engagement near Blair's Landing on April 12, in which the Confederate cavalry general Green was decapitated by a naval shell.\n\nAt Grand Ecore near Natchitoches, Banks received confidential orders from Grant to move the army to New Orleans. The river also continued to fall, and all the supply boats had to return downriver. Sensing that they were involved in a perceived defeat, Banks's relations deteriorated with the cantankerous A. J. Smith and the Navy and with most of the other generals as well.\n\nGeneral Kirby Smith decided to take three infantry divisions from Taylor and lead them north into Arkansas to crush Steele's army, despite General Taylor's strong protests they should be used against Banks. General Steele would never make it to Shreveport, due to supply difficulties and fights with Confederates. The Camden Expedition ended with Steele retreating to Little Rock. Smith left Taylor with one infantry division and the cavalry with which to continue to harass Banks. Learning that some of Taylor's 5,000 men had gotten south of him and that the fleet had left for Alexandria, Banks ordered a retreat from Grand Ecore. At the Battle of Monett's Ferry on April 23, some of Banks's forces crossed the Cane River on the Confederate flank and forced a division of Confederate cavalry under General Hamilton P. Bee to flee. The rest of the march to Alexandria was unremarkable, but Porter ran into a delaying ambush at the mouth of Cane River after he tarried to blow up the stuck .\n\nAt Alexandria, relations between Banks and many of the others deteriorated further. Each side sent exaggerated accounts to friendly newspapers and supporters. General John McClernand arrived with reinforcements from Texas, and he had also previously had poor relations with A. J. Smith and Porter. Smith obeyed only those orders he wanted to obey.\n\nPorter could not get many of his ironclads over the falls at Alexandria. Colonel Joseph Bailey designed Bailey's Dam, to which Banks soon gave night-and-day attention. Several boats got through before a partial dam collapse. An extra upriver dam provided additional water depth, allowing the march to resume. When the Federals left Alexandria, the town went up in flames, the origins of which are disputed. Because the Confederates had already burned most of the cotton, many speculators at Alexandria were disappointed.\n\nTaylor attempted to fool the Union command into believing many more men were present, but he did not try to stop the dam construction. He did shut down the lower river by attacking boats. Yet though General Taylor had promised to prevent the escape of the Federals, he could not do so. He blamed Kirby Smith for lack of support. En route to the Mississippi, an engagement at Mansura on May 16 was fought with almost no casualties. Yellow Bayou, the final conflict of the campaign, took place on May 18 with significant casualties in a burning forest. Transport ships were lashed together to allow Union forces to cross the wide Atchafalaya River. General Banks, on arrival near the Mississippi, was met by General Edward Canby, who had been named Banks's superior in a newly created regional department.\nThe Red River Campaign was a Union failure, the outcome of which did not have a major impact on the war. Conversely, it may have extended the length of the war by several months, as it diverted Union efforts from the far more important objective of capturing Mobile, Alabama. That event did not occur until 1865, and could probably have been accomplished by June 1864 if not for the Red River Campaign.\n\nThe failure of the campaign effectively ended the military career of Banks, and controversy surrounding his retreat, the presence of cotton speculators and the use of military boats to remove cotton dogged his early postbellum congressional campaigns. Admiral Porter realized a substantial sum of money during the campaign from the sale of cotton as prizes of war.\n\nThe Confederates lost two key commanders, Mouton and Green, and suffered casualties they could not afford. Perhaps more importantly, relations between the aggressive Taylor and cautious Smith were permanently damaged by their disagreement over Smith's decision to remove half of Taylor's troops following the Battle of Pleasant Hill. The lost opportunity to capture the entire Union fleet as it lay helpless above the falls at Alexandria haunted Taylor to his dying day; he was certain that Smith had robbed him a chance to cripple the Union forces. The arguments between the two generals resulted in Taylor's transfer to command of the Department of East Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama soon after the campaign ended.\n\n"}

It was the site of professional football teams, Monarcas Morelia in the top division of Mexican football and Monarcas Primera A in the league under that. This structure holds various events, such as concerts and religious gatherings and mass. Its official name \"Estadio José María Morelos y Pavón\" is meant to honor this hero of the Mexican War of Independence\n\nThe stadium has an irregular shape, because the areas behind the goals only have one level and 32 rows, along the side there are 4 levels (one grandstand, one other seating area and 2 box areas) and 49 stands.\n\nAccording to the Monarcas Morelia website, the capacity of the stadium is 35,000.\n\nThe city of Morelia before the existence of this structure, counted on the Estadio Venustiano Carranza as the home of first division side, Atlético Morelia, currently Monarcas Morelia. In 1984, 2 years before the 1986 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico, it was officially announced that Morelia would be one of the sites for the tournament, and a scale model of the new stadium was shown, very similar in capacity and structure to the Estadio Corregidora of Santiago de Querétaro, and would be located in the Southeast of the city, on the current grounds of the sport unit of Adolfo López Mateos. Excavation work soon began but problems in the foundation led to the suspension of the work and no other sites were sought. The World Cup site was transferred to the Estadio Sergio León Chavez, in Irapuato.\n\nFollowing the league tournaments of 1986–1987 1987–1988, despite not reaching the finals, the local side put on 2 brilliant displays in the liguilla. Demand for the new structure resurged. A group of Michoacán businessmen led by Luis Álvarez Barreiro, and with support from the new governor, Luis Martínez Villicaña, created a pro-construction sponsorship which was financed privately by ticket sales. At the conclusion of the construction, the sponsorship was handed over to the state of Michoacán. The stadium was one of the venues for the 2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup.\n\nOn February 16, 2016, during his first visit to Mexico, Pope Francis spoke to an estimated 50,000 young people at the stadium.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2022628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022628", "title": "Shōtōkai", "text": "Shōtōkai\n\nShotokai is not an official style of karate. Shotokai is the name of the association launched by Gichin Funakoshi originally in 1930. The original name was \"Dai Nihon Karate-do Kenkyukai\". The association is known in Japan as \"Dai Nihon Karate-do Shotokai\" since 1936. \"Shotokan\" is the name of its Honbu Dojo (main practicing hall). Gichin Funakoshi's karate style is also known as \"Shotokan ryu\".\n\nAfter Master Funakoshi died April 26, 1957 in Tokyo, according to the wishes of Master Funakoshi’s oldest son, Giei, the Shotokai (seniors were Genshin Hironishi and Shigeru Egami) was to conduct the funeral. The JKA / Kyokai led by Masatoshi Nakayama protested that they should be the ones to conduct the funeral. No agreement could be reached and JKA / Kyokai boycotted the funeral. This created a rift in Shotokan which continues to the present.\n\nThe name derives from \"Shoto\", the pen name which Funakoshi used to sign his poems, literally translated as \"pine leaves\". \"Kai\" means \"group\" or 'method'; therefore, Shotokai is translated as \"Shoto's group\" or \"Shoto's method.\" Shotokai's most prominent masters are Gichin Funakoshi with his top students Giko (Yoshitaka) Funakoshi, Genshin (Motonobu) Hironishi, Tadao Okuyama and Shigeru Egami.\n\nAt Funakoshi's death in 1957, his students split into several factions: on one side was a group known as \"Nihon Karate Kyokai\" (Japan Karate Association, JKA) and on another side the Shotokai Association. One of the largest issues between them was the question of whether competitions were to be introduced or not.\n\nAlthough Shotokai is the name of Shotokan Karate association, it has a defined practice method widely known as Shotokai Karate. Master Shigeru Egami defined the broad outlines of the new way of practising that he developed after having, in a number of tests, discovered the inefficiency of the karate method developed by other schools until that time.\n\nAfter years of research, Egami found an efficient way of striking by executing the movement in a relaxed state of mind and body. This is the basis of Shotokai. It focuses on suppleness and relaxation, as opposed to tenseness that generates force. Elaborating this basic idea, he suggested new forms of techniques and a new way of practising.\n\nShotokai refrains from competition because its founding master Gichin Funakoshi, who was also a Confucianist philosopher and a teacher, used to say that there are no contests in Karate. Master Egami wrote: \"First of all, we must practise Karate like a combat technique and then, with time and experience, we will be able to understand a certain state of soul and will be able to open ourselves to the horizons of 'jita-ittai' (the union of one with the other) which lay beyond fighting. This is the principle of coexistence which enables us to live together in prosperity.\"\n\nShotokai is the keeper of Gichin Funakoshi's Karate heritage, and has for example republished his books for many years. It has also kept the art of Shotokan Karate weaponry (primarily the traditional weapon of okinawan bojutsu, or Bō/kon in Japanese) within practice schedule.\n\nShotokai Karate differs much from other Shotokan karate branches (JKA, SKI, ITKF, SKA, etc.) in that it emphasizes spiritual practice over competitive tournaments. The traditional 15 forms or kata proposed by G. Funakoshi are practiced in the same way as in other forms of karate, although Shotokai often emphasizes smooth, flowing movements rather than the sharp, snappy, rigid movements of other styles, which does not mean that the style is gentle but rather it believes that an effective hand or foot strike resides in \"decontraction\". Sparring or Kumite in some Shotokai schools is often practiced with full strength attacks, and it is tightly controlled in terms of who is attacking and defending, and the attacks that can be performed in order to reduce the chance of injury. The essence of Shoto-Kai karate is found in the tactic of \"sen no sen\" - \"irimi\". This is the ability to predict an opponent's intent and entering into his attack, anticipating it; thus catching the opponent very early. A seasoned practitioner should be able to predict the opponent's intentions often before there is any visible movement, which is the ultimate fulfillment of Funakoshi's statement that stated: 'there is no first attack' in karate. The emphasis on \"sen no sen\" tactics is a profound and distinguishing element of Shoto Kai practice.\n"}

He set a Spanish libretto by Manuel Mujica Laínez, based on his 1962 novel about the 16th-century Italian eccentric Pier Francesco Orsini. \n\nThe opera makes use of twelve-tone techniques, quarter tones – primarily in the harp parts – and controlled stochastic textures of non-synchronous repetitions of motifs and cells. Published by Boosey & Hawkes, New York, the work's two acts encompass a prelude and 15 scenes. Pola Suarez Urtubey has published an analysis of the opera with an outline of the dramatic structure.\n\nThe opera had its world premiere at the Opera Society of Washington, Washington D.C., on 19 May 1967. The same production was first given at New York City Opera on 14 March 1968. The work had been scheduled for its first performance in Argentina on 4 August 1967 at the Teatro Colón, but the Argentine de facto president, Juan Carlos Onganía, had banned the production, objecting to the sexual content of the story. The first performance in Argentina did not occur until 1972, with the composer in attendance.\n\nThe first UK production was by the English National Opera on 3 November 1976, in an English translation by Lionel Salter.\n\nThe first production in Spain was at the Teatro Real, Madrid, on 24 April 2017 with John Daszak in the title role, as a joint production by Pierre Audi with the Dutch National Opera.\n\n\nPier Francesco Orsini, the Duke of Bomarzo, a stunted hunchback, drinks what his astrologer Silvio de Narni claims to be a magic potion that will grant the Duke immortality. However, the drink turns out to be poisoned. After the poison starts to work, Bomarzo begins to recall his life in a series of flashbacks.\n\nHis father drags the young Pier Francesco into a room where a large skeleton dances and haunts him.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 8, 2004. This is one of several Simpsons episodes that features mini-stories.\n\nMarge takes Bart, Lisa, and Milhouse to the library to study. When they go inside, they realize that the library has removed all the books except for the popular ones. Marge makes the best of this situation by telling stories about history.\n\nKing Henry VIII (Homer) is a gluttonous slob who stuffs his face while singing, \"I'm Henery the Eighth, I am.\" A herald (Sideshow Mel) announces the entrance of Henry's wife, Queen Margerine of Aragon (Marge), who tells him to stop singing. Henry wipes his face with Magna Carta and gripes that Margerine has born him only a daughter (Lisa). That night Henry dreams of a son (Bart) and strangles him, screaming, \"Get out of my dreams and into my wife!\"\n\nWhen Anne Boleyn (Lindsay Naegle) promises to produce a son were she his wife, Margerine intervenes and drags Henry to a marriage counselor (Doctor Hibbert). Henry explains that he wants to marry Anne, but cannot execute his wife because her father is the King of Spain. The counselor tells him that while his feelings are valid, marriage is hard work. Henry then threatens to behead the terrified counselor, who quickly reverses his position.\n\nThe Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas More (Ned Flanders), protests that divorce is not permitted in Roman Catholic Church. The King retorts that he will start his own Church. More objects, prompting Henry to \"cannon-ize\" him in honour of his principles by shooting him out of a cannon from the roof of Hampton Court.\n\nHenry's new Church grants him his divorce, yet Margerine's lawyer (the Blue-Haired Lawyer) orders Henry to give half of his kingdom to Margerine; he rips a map of the British Isles in half, giving her Ireland. As Henry marries Anne Boleyn, the Archbishop of Canterbury (Reverend Lovejoy) alters the Sign of the Cross by saying, \"In the Name of the Henry, the Hank, and the Holy Harry. Amen.\"\n\nNine months later, Anne bears Henry another daughter, and is quickly beheaded by an executioner (Chief Wiggum) on Tower Hill. Henry marries a total of six times, including to the squeaky-voiced Jane Seymour (Miss Springfield), the unfeminine Anne of Cleves (Otto Mann), and the elderly Catherine Parr (Agnes Skinner). He still fails to produce a male heir, and executes his wives whenever he tires of them. This prompts a courtier (Moe Szyslak) to inform Henry nervously that they are running out of pikes, resulting in his own beheading.\n\nFinally, in a scene set to the tune of \"Greensleeves,\" Henry is old and sick, lying in his bed with Margerine by his side. He apologizes for having locked her up in a dungeon and asks her to become his Queen again. Margerine accepts tenderly, then violently smothers Henry with a pillow.\n\nMilhouse leaves eagerly to start his school report on Henry VIII, only to be tripped by Nelson, who steals his notes.\n\nMeriwether Lewis (Lenny) and William Clark (Carl) are assigned to explore the West by President Thomas Jefferson (Mayor Quimby). They meet a tribe of Native Americans, whose chief (Homer) offers them the guidance of his daughter, Sacagawea (Lisa), whose name means, \"Little know-it-all who will not shut her maizehole.\" They are accompanied by her husband (Milhouse), until he is slaughtered by Sacagawea's brother (Bart).\n\nSacagawea gives them many tips on how to survive the land, including how to scare a cougar, but quickly becomes fed up with Lewis and Clark's stupidity. Finally, she leaves them and sets off back home. She encounters a cougar, but before it can attack, Lewis and Clark save her using the advice she gave them. The party arrives at the Pacific Ocean and a heavy downpour begins, prompting Lewis and Clark to name the rain-soaked place Eugene, Oregon. The two explorers reward Sacagawea by creating the Sacagawea dollar – which Marge explains can be exchanged at the bank for a real dollar.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Bart) is a big hit in Vienna, playing sonatas on the grand piano and pushed along by his overbearing, money-hungry father (Homer). Salieri (Lisa) is resentful of her brother's talents, especially when Mozart wins the award for best composer. At Mozart's flatulence-themed opera, \"The Musical Fruit\", Salieri serves the Emperor (Montgomery Burns) drugged wine. The opera is a success until the foppish audience sees the Emperor asleep and mimics him, leaving Mozart stunned.\n\nThe failure of his opera leads to Mozart's fall from popularity, after which he develops a high fever and becomes deathly ill, enduring heavy leechings at the hands of an incompetent doctor (Dr. Nick Riviera). At her brother's deathbed, Salieri tells him she wanted to ruin his life, not kill him. Mozart confesses that he thought highly of Salieri's work, believing that it would be remembered more than his – but his youthful death ensures he and his music will be immortalized forever. He then says, \"Eat my pantaloons\", and dies. The next day, Salieri visits the Emperor's court to submit Mozart's Requiem as her own. The Emperor, however, is already focused on Ludwig van Beethoven (Nelson Muntz), whose performance of \"Ode to Joy\" on the piano prompts him to declare all other music obsolete. Crushed, Salieri throws the Requiem away, boards a carriage filled with lunatics, and laughs maniacally as it drives away.\n\nLisa realizes that Marge's telling of the lives of Mozart and Salieri is clearly based upon the movie \"Amadeus\". She calls the movie completely inaccurate, explaining that Mozart worked hard on his music and that Salieri was a celebrated composer in his own time. Homer recalls that Tom Hulce starred both in \"Amadeus\" and in \"Animal House\", and he sings an inaccurate rendition of the \"Animal House\" theme over the epilogue.\n\nThe episode ends with a facetious epilogue followed by closing credits accompanied by Mozart's \"Eine kleine Nachtmusik\":\n\nSome items seen in the library are 'Everybody Poops: The Video\", \"Yu-Gi-Oh! Price Guides\", and \"Itchy & Scratchy\" books on tape.\n\nThe title of the episode is a satire of The Beatles' movie, song, and album \"Magical Mystery Tour\".\n\nWhen King Henry first appears, he is gorging himself while singing the 1911 music hall song “I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am”. The lyrics, however, are altered to refer to the King's enormous appetite and reputation for gluttony. Henry also wipes his face with Magna Carta, a document which limits the power of the Monarchy and forms the basis of the Constitution of the United Kingdom. During King Henry's dream about his son, a brief snatch of the song, \"Greensleeves\" can be heard. While in the marriage counselor's office, Henry is reading a magazine called \"The Yorker\", a send-up of \"The New Yorker\", until Margerine reminds him that they've come to talk about their problems. The Sir Thomas More subplot is a satire of Fred Zinnemann's Academy Award-winning film, \"A Man for All Seasons\", starring Paul Scofield as Sir Thomas and Robert Shaw as King Henry. Later, in a dig at Tudor anti-Catholicism, Henry watches a Punch and Judy-style show in which Itchy & Scratchy accuse each other of conducting an illegal Catholic Mass and for refusing to sign the Act of Supremacy.\n\nAs Lisa points out at the end of the episode, the Mozart segment is a satire of Peter Shaffer's stage play \"Amadeus\" and Milos Forman's Academy Award-winning film of the same name. During Mozart's first concert, Otto Mann calls out a request for \"Sonata in A, K.331\". In reality, the K numbering system for Mozart's work was not introduced until 70 years after Mozart's death. Later, Salieri is compared to the three \"untalented\" Mozarts—Randy, Jermaine, and Tito from the Jackson Five. Mozart's opera \"The Musical Fruit\" is a satire of both \"The Magic Flute\", and the children's song \"Beans, Beans, the Musical Fruit,\" while the opera is sung to the tune of his composition Eine kleine Nachtmusik, which also plays over the closing credits. A fragment from the movement \"Lacrimosa\" from \"Mozart's Requiem\" can be heard while Mozart is dying. When Salieri arrives at the Imperial Palace, the Emperor is listening to Beethoven perform the Ode to Joy from his 9th Symphony on the piano. When the Emperor declares all other music obsolete, Beethoven points at Salieri and \"Haw Haws\" to the opening of his 5th Symphony.\n\n"}

He was a patron of secular learning, and became the consul for the year 485. He supported Pope Symmachus in the schism over the Popes' election, and was executed with his son-in-law Boethius after being charged with treason.\n\nHe belonged to the Symmachi, one of the richest and most influential senatorial families in Rome; his father, Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, had been consul in 446. Memmius Symmachus had three daughters (Rusticiana, Galla and Proba) and adopted the young Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius when his father died; later Boethius married Rusticiana, and the couple had two sons, Symmachus and Boethius, both consuls in 522. Memmius Symmachus' civil offices included being appointed sole consul for 485, the third known member of his family to hold this office.\n\nAlthough Symmachus was the head of a family with a long connection with Pagan tradition—his grandfather Quintus Aurelius Symmachus delivered a famous speech urging the return of the Altar of Victory to the Roman Senate House—he was an ardent Christian, interested both in theological disputes and, more prosaically, in the struggles for the control of the Pope. During and after the disputed election of Pope Symmachus (who was apparently not related to him), he and Anicius Probus Faustus Niger were the only two Senators known to support the pope against his more popular rival, Laurentius.\n\nSymmachus cultivated the ancient Roman culture, writing a \"Roman history\" in seven volumes; this work has been lost except for a section quoted by Jordanes in his \"Getica\". Symmachus' wealth enabled his patronage: he was involved in publication of the \"Commentarii in Somnium Scipionis\" by Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius, and there is even a copy of the work corrected by his hand.\n\nFor the most part, Symmachus maintained good relationships with the new rulers of Italy—both Odovacer and Theodoric the Great -- demonstrated by his appointment as \"praefectus urbi\" between 476 and 491, consul in 485, \"patricius\" within 510, and even reaching the influential rank of \"caput senatus\" (president of the Senate). His visit to Constantinople, after which Priscian dedicated him some poems, was likely on behalf of king Theodoric. However, Symmachus contradicted the Ostrogothic king, who condemned him to death for treason in 526, one year after the execution of Boethius.\n\n"}

The kingdom is a cultural institution which promotes popular participation and unity among the people of the region through development programs to improve their standard of living. Busoga strives for a united people who have economic, social and cultural prosperity and assists the Kyabazinga.\n\nBusoga means \"Land of the Soga\", and is the kingdom of the 11 principalities of the Basoga or Soga (singular \"Musoga\") people. Its capital is Bugembe, near Jinja (Uganda's second-largest city, after Kampala). Busoga comprises eight districts: Kamuli, Iganga, Bugiri, Mayuge, Jinja, Luuka and the new districts of Kaliro and Busiki. Each district is headed by an elected chairperson or a Local Council Five, and municipalities are headed by an elected mayor. Jinja is the industrial and economic hub of Busoga. Busoga is bordered on the north by shallow Lake Kyoga (separating it from Lango), on the west by the Victoria Nile (separating it from Buganda), on the south by Lake Victoria (separating it from Tanzania and Kenya) and on the east by the Mpologoma River (separating it from smaller tribal groups such as the Adhola, Bugwere and Bugisu). It also includes several islands in Lake Victoria, such as Buvuma Island.\n\nBusoga is ruled by the Isebantu Kyabazinga, who is currently William Kadhumbula Gabula Nadiope IV, the Gabula of Bugabula, and grandson to Wilberforce Kadhumbula Nadiope, former vice president and also Kyabazinga of Busoga Kingdom. In 1995, the government restored monarchies in Uganda in Article 246(1) of the constitution of Uganda. On 11 February 1996, Henry Wako Muloki was reinstated as Kyabazinga Isebantu of Busoga. He served until 1 September 2008, when he died of esophageal cancer at the Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala at age 87. In a condolence message, Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni described Muloki as \"a great cultural leader and father\" who was \"generous and kind\". Museveni noted that since his re-installation, Muloki was a unifying factor in Busoga: \"The Government has had the privilege of working with Isebantu Muloki in developing our nation\". Referring to the Kyabazinga as \"a strong pillar\", the president said that although Busoga was one of the youngest kingdoms, under Muloki's leadership it had become strong: \"Uganda mourns not only one of her esteemed traditional leaders but a national who put development and the welfare of the people of Busoga at the helm of his reign\". Muloki's achievements included programs for youth, the elderly, and the poor and the education of girls. Although the Royal Chiefs of Busoga at first elected Edward Columbus Wambuzi, Muloki's son, as Kyabazinga of Busoga, the election was contested due to lack of quorum (at least eight chiefs) and thus electing later Gabula Nadiope IV with ten out of eleven chiefs and was crowned on 13 September 2014.\n\nBusoga's written history began in 1862. On 28 July Royal Geographical Society explorer John Hanning Speke arrived at Ripon Falls (near Jinja, where the Victoria Nile flows from Lake Victoria and begins its descent to Egypt. Since Speke's route (inland from the East African coast) took him around the southern end of Lake Victoria, he approached Busoga from the west (through Buganda). Having reached his goal (the source of the Nile), he turned northward and followed the river downstream without exploring Busoga. He records, however, being told that \"Usoga\" (Swahili for Busoga) was an island (it is bordered on all four sides by water).\n\nDuring the 19th century, one of the main routes along which Europeans travelled from the coast to Buganda passed through southern Busoga. Speke, James Grant, Gerald Portal, Frederick Lugard, J. R. Macdonald and Bishop Tucket noted that Busoga had plentiful food and was densely populated. However, between 1898–99 and 1900–01 the first cases of sleeping sickness were reported.\n\nIn 1906, orders were issued to evacuate the region. Despite attempts to clear the area, the epidemic continued until 1910. As a result, most of the densely populated parts of Busoga (with an original population of over 200,000) were depopulated within ten years. Lubas Palace at Bukaleba and the European fruit mission collapsed, and survivors were relocated to other parts of Busoga. Southern Busoga, about one-third of the kingdom's area, was depopulated by 1910. During the 1920s and 1930s, some evacuees who survived the epidemic began to return to their original land. In 1940 a new outbreak appeared in the area, and only in 1956 did resettlement (promoted by the government) begin again.\n\nThe result of the epidemic was that southern Busoga, its most densely populated area, was virtually uninhabited. Other areas affected by sleeping sickness, including eastern Bukooli and Busiki, were depopulated as well. Famines also triggered substantial population movements. Parts of northeastern Busoga and the adjacent Bukandi district (across the Mpologoma River) experienced famines in and 1944. Populations in these areas shrank; many people were killed by the famines, and survivors moved to other areas for safety.\n\nThe effects of these movements were apparent in the growth in population of central and peri-urban Busoga. Many Basoga left Busoga during this period for other districts.\n\nDuring the pre-colonial era, people left their traditional lands and state structures disappeared. A number of clans and chiefdoms were decimated by famine and epidemics, and people migrated to Busoga with the traditions and cultures of other lands. A need for security fueled population growth in urban and peri-urban areas of Busoga such as Jinja, Iganga, Kamuli, Kaliro and their surrounding areas\n\nFrom 1920 to the 1970s, Jinja (Busoga's capital) gained economic importance due to cotton production and the completion of the Uganda Railway and the Owen Falls Dam. The town became an agri-industrial centre with factories, cottage industries and a well-developed infrastructure. People from rural Busoga came to work in the factories and in domestic work. Among the newcomers were Asian families. Services such as piped water, electricity, roads, hospitals and schools were improved to serve the growing population. Farmers were assured of markets in the towns, grew cash and food crops such as cotton, coffee, bananas, potatoes, cassava, fruits and vegetables. The standard of living improved; the kingdom's revenue increased, enabling it to build more infrastructure. Subsistence farming diminished, with the population turning to economic production demanded by the Europeans.\n\nBy the time of independence in 1962, Busoga was one of the most prosperous regions in Uganda. Jinja was home to 70 percent of Uganda's industries and the Nalubaale Power Station (Owen Falls Dam), which supplies electricity to Uganda and parts of Kenya and Tanzania. Jinja was also home to the majority of Uganda's Asian population. These Ugandan Asians, brought to Uganda from the Indian sub-continent by the British during the Raj, helped establish Jinja as one of East Africa's largest commercial centres.\n\nAround the turn of the 16th century, the Baisengobi clan from Bunyoro gained power. Mukama Namutukula of the royal Babiito family of Bunyoro is said to have left Bunyoro during the 16th century as part of the kingdom's expansion policy, travelling east across Lake Kyoga with his wife Nawudo, a few servants, arms and a dog and landing at Iyingo in northern Busoga (in the present-day Kamuli District).\n\nMukama, who enjoyed hunting, was taken with the land. He engaged in metalworking: blacksmithing and making hoes, iron utensils and spears. Of Mukama's children five boys survived, and when he returned to Bunyoro he gave them land to oversee. His firstborn, Wakoli, received Bukooli; Zibondo received Bulamogi, Ngobi Kigulu, Tabingwa Luuka, and the youngest son, Kitimbo, received Bugabula. These areas later became administrative and cultural centers in Busoga. When Mukama did not return, his sons regarded themselves as the legitimate rulers of their respective areas. They presided over their dominions, employing governing methods and cultural rituals similar to those in Bunyoro. This political and cultural arrangement in Busoga continued until the late 19th century, when the colonialists persuaded its rulers to organize a federation. The federation was governed by a Lukiiko.\n\nBefore 1906 although Busoga was called a \"kingdom\", unlike its western neighbor Buganda it had no central ruler. That year, a king was installed at the behest of the British. Before this, the Basoga were organized in semi-autonomous chiefdoms influenced by Bunyoro and then Buganda. The Bugandan king, the Kabaka, had a centuries-long lineage. In Busoga some of the chiefs were appointed by the Kabaka, and may have been descendants of favored Baganda chiefs who were given authority to rule land in Busoga. Others belonged to landowning families in Busoga who were self-appointed rulers of large areas. The British united the chiefs in the Lukiiko and appointed Semei Kakungulu, a Muganda from Buganda, as its president (and Busoga's first leader). Strife amongst the chiefs and clans continued, with most Basoga retaining an affiliation to their chief, clan or dialect, and the Lukiiko collapsed.\n\nMeanwhile, the colonial rulers were grooming Bugabulan ruler Yosia Nadiope (one of the first Basoga students at Kings College Budo, in 1906) as the first permanent ruler of the Busoga Federation. However, in 1913 Nadiope died of malaria. The following year, Bulamogi ruler Ezekeriel Tenywa Wako completed his studies at Kings College Budo. With British support and his administrative and educational background, Wako was a suitable candidate for the post. In 1919, the chiefs of Busoga resolved in the Lukiiko to elect Wako president of Busoga. Gideon Obodha of Kigulu (another contender for the post) was unfamiliar with the British system, and William Wilberforce Nadiope Kadhumbula of Bugabula was an infant whose regent (Mwami Mutekanga) was ineligible as a \"mukoopi\" (a commoner). In 1918-19, the title of Isebantu Kyabazinga was created and Wako took the throne. He received a salary of £550 and was permitted to collect taxes in Butembe county in compensation for his lost role in the chiefdom of Bulamogi. In 1925 Wako became a member of the Uganda Kings Council, consisting of the Kyabazinga of Busoga, the Kabaka of Buganda, the Omukamas of Bunyoro and Toro and the Omugabe of Ankole.\n\nOn 11 February 1939 Owekitibwa Ezekerial Tenywa Wako, father of the last Kyabazinga of Busoga Henry Wako Muloki and the Zibondo of Bulamogi, was installed as the first Kyabazinga of Busoga (a title he held until his 1949 retirement). By Wako's retirement, the Lukiiko had expanded to include elected representatives (two from each of Busoga's 55 sub-counties).\n\nWhen Wako retired the Busoga Lukiiko resolved that the Kyabazinga should be elected from the five lineages of Baise Ngobi (Ababiito), hereditary rulers traditionally believed to have been the five sons of the Omukama of Bunyoro who migrated to Busoga from Bunyoro. This method of election was used for subsequent elections, beginning in 1949 when Owekitibwa Chief William Wilberforce Nadiope Kadhumbula of Bugabula was elected. He served for two terms of three years each, followed by Henry Wako Muloki (who also served two terms). In 1957, the title Inhebantu of Busoga was introduced for the wife of the Kyabazinga (or Isebantu).\n\nWhen monarchies were abolished in 1966, the Kyabazinga was dethroned. Idi Amin expelled the Asians from Uganda in 1972, and Jinja suffered socially and economically. The government of Yoweri Museveni has tried to encourage them to return. The Asian influence remains, particularly in architecture and street names.\n\nIn 1995, the government restored monarchies in Uganda. On 11 February, Henry Wako Muloki was reinstated as Kyabazinga according to Kisogan tradition. Unlike most monarchs, the Kyabazinga has no heir or crown prince but is succeeded by a chief elected by the Lukiiko and the Royal Council.\n\nThree past Kyabazingas have presided over the federated state of Busoga since 1939: Ezekiel Tenywa Wako, Yosia Nadiope and William Wilberforce Nadiope Kadhumbula. Kadhumbula waged an \"emizindula\" (war on theft) and ended a British practice in the fight against smallpox \"(kawumpuli)\" where residents were required to publicly supply rat tails for counting to prove that they had killed the rats. His opposition brought him into conflict with the British; he was exiled to Bunyoro, later leading the Basoga into the Second World War.\n\nKadhumbula played an important role in Uganda's independence struggle; he was also the first vice-president of independent Uganda and chairman of the Uganda People's Congress (UPC).\nKadhumbula built infrastructure such as roads, hospitals and government centres, and mobilised the Basoga for agriculture. Balangira High School later became Busoga College.\n\nThe Busoga Royal Council is composed of the 11 traditional leaders of Busoga: the heads of the five royal families and the six tribal chiefs.\nThe \"Katukiro\" (Prime Minister) of Busoga is Joseph Muvawala . The office of the Katukiro in the Kingdom is an important and a vital one. The \"Katukiro\" is the head of the kingdom's government, and the spokesperson for the Kyabazinga and the kingdom.\n\nThis was the first settlement area for the Bunyoro Basoga, led by Mukama. Although Kagulu's cultural influence is widespread, its visible landmark is Kagulu Rock. The rock is between two roads which fork at its foot, leading to Gwaya and Iyingo. The rock has a clear view of almost all Busoga, with steps making it easier for visitors to reach the top. Kagulu Rock has been for a long time a major adventure and tourist attraction in Eastern Uganda. Previously, it had caught the curious eyes of the foreign NGO workers in the area, but with the advent of the local initiative to promote the site, Kagulu Rock is now a big attraction to all.\n\nTwo kilometers from Kamuli on the Kamuli-Jinja road, the site includes a shrine and the residence of former Kyabazinga William Wilberforce Kadhumbula Nadiope (who died in 1976). The marble-covered shrine contains the graves of other members of the royal family, including Nadiope's father and mother (Yosia Nadiope and Nasikombi). Other graves in the shrine are those of his son, former Uganda government minister Wilson Nadiope (who died in 1991), and his mother, Yuliya Babirye Nadiope (who died in 2004). The main palace residence is a legacy of the British colonial government, which donated it in 1914.\n\nThe source of the Nile, the world's second-longest river, at Lake Victoria was discovered by John Speke and is an internationally known attraction.\n\nThis former waterfall was submerged in November 2011 by the Bujagali Dam.\n\nSouthern Busoga is bordered by Lake Victoria, whose coastline runs from Jinja east to the Kenyan border.\n\nThis nonprofit cultural organization is headquartered in Boston. Twegaite's main objective is to revitalize Busoga's economy, health and education.\n\n\n\n"}

He was appointed a Professor at the University in 2007, and in 2017 was appointed Emeritus Professor. His work is in the fields of peace research, scientific controversies, science and technology studies, sociology, political science, media studies, law, journalism and education, as well as research on whistleblowing and dissent in the context of science. Martin was president of Whistleblowers Australia from 1996 to 1999 and remains their International Director. He has been criticized by medical professionals and public health advocates for promoting HIV/AIDS denialism and vaccine hesitancy in the context of his work.\n\nMartin has spoken at a British Science Association Festival of Science, and testified at the Australian Federal Senate's Inquiry into Academic Freedom. The crustacean \"Polycheles martini\" was named after him.\n\nMartin's original academic field was theoretical physics, and he worked in both stratospheric modelling and numerical methods during his career. He has published extensively about the social dynamics and politicisation of controversial scientific topics. His topics of inquiry have included the globalization of polarised science such as the origin of HIV/AIDS. He argues that there are situations in which scientific research that threatens vested interests can be suppressed. He identifies a number of direct and indirect mechanisms through which this can occur, ranging from the denial of funds and the denial of promotion and tenure, through to the creation of a \"general climate of fear\". Martin's work on in this area has provided what Delborne describes as a \"key foundation for conceptualizing scientific dissent\".\n\nMartin has been criticised for supporting the incorrect proposal that oral polio vaccine caused AIDS. The hypothesis was first popularised in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine by way of journalist Curtis and AIDS activist Elswood in 1992, and was later further promoted by the journalist/writer Hooper and Martin, with Hooper crediting Martin for giving the OPV-AIDS link hypothesis \"further publicity and credibility\". Martin disputes the claim that he has been a supporter of the hypothesis, instead saying that he has \"never argued in favour of the OPV theory\", but has instead stated \"that it was and remains worthy of consideration yet in many ways has been unfairly dismissed\". A 2016 article in \"The Australian\" described Martin's 2010 paper as claiming \"that medical researchers had colluded to silence the theory that the AIDS virus was caused by contaminated polio vaccines in 1950s Africa.\"\n\nMartin has been active in the criticism of university systems. He has criticized conflicts of interest where universities are managing internal investigations that may lead to bad publicity, and recommends having independent groups investigate allegations of misconduct; he has written about the unauthorised use of research produced by students and junior researchers by senior academics; and he has been outspoken against sexual relationships between staff and students. He also reports that any bias within universities could simply be due to students strategically working in-line with the biases of their teachers.\n\nMartin believes that if complainants go through the official channels the outcome is very predictable, in that organisation's internal grievance procedures or making a complaint to the relevant ombudsman doesn't work. He also believes whistleblower laws don't work, saying; \"Not only are whistleblower laws flawed through exemptions and in-built weaknesses but in their implementation they are rarely helpful\".\n\nIn April 2001 Martin published an article in defence of a sacked academic at UOW in the national newspaper \"The Australian.\" In a response published in the same paper, the Vice-Chancellor of Murdoch University Steven Schwartz accused Martin of a position supporting the concept of a \"laissez-faire attitude towards academic freedom (in which all sides are presented impartially)\" saying his \"approach to academic freedom is neither logical nor practical\" as this approach \"forces universities to abandon their most cherished values: scholarship, wisdom and truth\".\n\nImmunologist and research scientist Greg Woods refuted Martin’s posit on the Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease stating Matin’s 2014 paper in \"The Conversation\" on the theory behind the cancer \"misrepresents the state of the science\".\n\nIn 2014, Martin published a paper characterising criticism of Andrew Wakefield's discredited claims about vaccines and autism as \"suppression of vaccination dissent\". In 2016, an Agence Science-Presse piece accused Martin of defending \"the idea of a vaccine-autism link.\" However, Martin disputes this, saying: \"I have never defended this idea.\" \"The Australian\" reported that \"Martin is a former paid member of the anti-vaccine Australian Vaccination Network\", and that Martin states that he is also a member of the American Skeptics Society.\n\nMartin has been criticised for his role in the Judith Wilyman PhD controversy where medical academics and the AMA raised concerns of whether Martin had the necessary knowledge to assess her doctorate which discussed vaccine science. \"The Australian\" has criticised him as not recognising academic rigour over academic freedom, and surgeon John Cunningham called on the University to have the thesis \"reviewed by people whom have knowledge of vaccinations\".\n\nIn 2016 the Australian Skeptics criticised Martin's supervision of Wilyman by presenting Martin, Wilyman and the Social Sciences Department of the University of Wollongong the satirical Bent Spoon Award for awarding \"a PhD thesis riddled with errors, misstatements, poor and unsupported 'evidence' and conspiratorial thinking\".\n\nIn 2017, Martin received publicity for his supervision of a PhD that argued bee stings were more dangerous than terrorist bombers, on the grounds that \"more people die in car accidents, from domestic murders and bee stings in Australia than terrorist attacks\". \"News Corp\" wrote that the \"360-page essay also takes aim at the ABC, News Corp Australia and the St James Ethics Centre for backing torture. And it claims the federal government has a \"pro-torture ideology\".\"\n\nMartin previously supervised an unsuccessful PhD by Michael Primero titled \"The 'politics' of vaccination: a scientific controversy analysis\", who went on to be a director of Viera Scheibner's anti-vaccination group \"Medical Veritas\".\n\n\nHis most cited papers are:\n\n\n"}

The play concerns two women at the turn of the 20th century who are in a \"Boston marriage\", a relationship between two women that may involve both physical and emotional intimacy. After widespread belief that Mamet could only write for men, the playwright released this play, which centers exclusively on women.\n\nAnna and Claire argue over Claire's new found \"Love\" while Anna's Scottish maid, Catherine, is brought to tears by her employer's harsh verbal rebukes. Things get tense as Anna, a mistress to a wealthy gentleman, tries to talk Claire out of her profession of love for another: a young woman. Claire, on the other hand, has already made plans with her young love to meet at Anna's house in the hopes that she will be able to persuade her new love to engage in a \"vile assignation.\" Things go awry, however, when the girl arrives and recognizes that an emerald necklace that Anna is wearing belongs to her mother.\n\nThe plot line focuses on whether Anna and Claire will be able to find a way to hold on to both the girl and her wealthy but unfaithful father. The play is delivered through quick, witty Victorian-era dialogue, mixed with double entendres and vernacular expressions, to explore the relationship between the two women and their maid. Through humor and nuance, the play explores the negotiation, conflict, compromise and reconciliation that arise in their relationship.\n\n\"Boston Marriage\" was originally produced by the American Repertory Theater (Robert Brustein, Artistic Director; Robert J. Orchard, Managing Director) at the Hasty Pudding Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts on June 4, 1999. It was directed by David Mamet; the set design was by Sharon Kaitz and J. Michael Griggs; the lighting design was by John Ambrosone; and the costume design was by Harriet Voyt. The cast included Rebecca Pidgeon (Claire), Felicity Huffman (Anna), and Mary McCann (Catherine).\n\nIt was performed in London at the Donmar Warehouse from March 2001 until April 2001. Directed by Phyllida Lloyd, it featured Zoë Wanamaker (Anna), Anna Chancellor (Claire), and Lyndsey Marshal. It moved to the West End at the New Ambassadors Theatre, where it ran from November 28, 2001 until February 16, 2002.\n\n\"Boston Marriage\" was first performed in Melbourne in 2007 produced by leading independent theatre company Hoy Polloy. It was directed by Hoy Polloy Artistic Director Wayne Pearn and featured Helen Hopkins, Corinne Davies and Eleanor Wilson.\n\n\"Boston Marriage\" ran Off-Broadway at The Public Theater from November 5, 2002 through December 22, 2002. It was directed by Karen Kohlhaas and starred Kate Burton as Anna, Martha Plimpton as Claire, and Arden Myrin.\n\nThe play was performed in Lima, Peru in early 2007 under the direction of theatre director and actor Alberto Isola.\n\nThe play was performed in Melbourne, Australia by the Melbourne Theatre Company (MTC) through June 2010. Pamela Rabe, Margaret Mills and Sara Gleeson star, directed by Aidan Fennessy. It returned to the Boston area in September 2010, as presented at the New Repertory Theater. As part of the Dublin Theatre Festival 2010, the Gate Theatre, Dublin, Ireland staged \"Boston Marriage\" as part of its \"BMP\" programme; celebrating the links between Beckett, Pinter and Mamet. The play ran on 29 September and 2 October, 2010.\n\n \"Boston Marriage\" is one of the few plays written by a male playwright that exclusively includes lesbian characters. The play takes on an anti-patriarchal stance. Anna does not show any genuine interest in the man she is involved with. In the end of the play, Anna’s male love interest leaves her for his wife and wants her to return the emerald jewel that he gave her. This gives Claire fiscal power over Anna which contrasts the Victorian tradition of men owning their wives’ money. \n\nThe plot of \"Boston Marriage\" does not include the common stereotypes of women being married to a man, financially dependent on their husbands, and spend most of their time taking care of their children.\nLesbian themes in theatre is a direct response to America’s anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-theatrical attitudes in its history. “Lesbian” was not a word used in Western society until the nineteenth century. The roles of lesbian and gay characters in theatre were considered to be two separate themes until the latter half of the twentieth century. There is not as much public interest in plays written exclusively about lesbian characters than there are about plays with exclusively gay characters. Similarly to early plays that included gay characters, plays including lesbians traditionally ended in violence and death. Plays with exclusively lesbian characters that were written by lesbian playwrights targeted all-female audiences.\n\nMore lesbian plays were written in the 1960s and 1970s largely due to the feminist movement. Lack of public interest lead to a decrease in the number of lesbian plays written and performed until the late 1990s when The Boston Marriage was written and early twenty-first century.\nLGBTQ+ theatre is dominated by white gay men. David Mamet is one of the few heterosexual male playwrights to write about a play with exclusively lesbian characters.\n\nBoston Marriage is the only play David Mamet wrote that only includes lesbian characters.\n\n"}

The Thunder won the regular season Western Conference championship each season from 2003 to 2005, but lost in the Rogers Cup semifinal each of those years.\n\nHamilton Thunder joined the Canadian Professional Soccer League in 2002, which marked the return of professional soccer to the city of Hamilton since the folding of the Hamilton Steelers of the original Canadian Soccer League in 1991. The club played its first competitive match on May 11, 2002 in a friendly against the Toronto Lynx of the USL A-League. Toronto won the match in a 1-0 victory, but Hamilton managed to attract over 2000 spectators to Brian Timmis Stadium a relatively high number for CPSL standards. The club hired Marko Maschke as head coach who previously coached professionally in Germany and China. Maschke brought in several players from the 2001 St. Catharines Wolves playoff champions roster, and signed promising players like Ian Bennett, Miles O'Connor, Matthew O'Connor, Orlin Chalmers, and young goalkeeping prospect Roberto Ferrari. In their debut match the Thunder wrecked the Vaughan Sun Devils in 5-1 victory at home.\n\nHamilton started off well with a three-game undefeated streak and had four players loaned out to the Calgary Storm of the A-League - Orlin Chalmers, Matthew O'Connor, Salvatore Borgh, and Wojtek Zarzycki. After struggling for a bit the Thunder managed to recuperate and finish third in the Western Conference standings, but missed out at the postseason by losing 3-2 to the Mississauga Olympians in a wildcard match. The 2002 season sparked numerous controversies within the club`s organization. One incident occurred on September 20, 2002 where most senior players boycotted a match scheduled that day, due to reports of unpaid salaries to players and staff members, and unpaid rent fees for stadium use. The incident resulted in the resignation of head coach Maschke, and the release of several senior players. The CPSL chairman Vincent Ursini responded that conditions will be applied to Hamilton owner Italo Ferrari.\n\nIn 2003, Hamilton hired the services of Duncan Wilde as the new head coach with coaching credentials from England. Wilde signed several new additions to the squad - acquiring Aaron Steele, Sergio De Luca, and Dave Simpson. The 2003 campaign started off well with a seven-game undefeated streak placing the Thunder on top of the Western Conference. Unfortunately Wilde announced his resignation as head coach after disagreements with team owner Italo Ferrari, and was replaced by Ivan Marković. Further changes were made by the hiring of former Canadian National Soccer League Commissioner Rocco Lofranco as the club's new CEO, and the signing of Croatian players Petar Dajak, Mario Zupetic, Vedran Bacek, and Zeljiko Dukic.\n\nAfter only two weeks of coaching Markovic decided to return to Croatia due to unexpected health concerns. His replacement was former Portugal national football team and Benfica F.C. assistant coach Manuel Gonçalves Gomes. Hamilton`s situation improved under Gomes as he led them to a seven-game undefeated streak to retain their position on top of the standings in their conference. On the conclusion of the 2003 season Hamilton clinched their first trophy the Western Conference title and qualified for the postseason. Their playoff run came to a conclusion in the semi-finals against Vaughan Sun Devils losing to a score of 2-0.\n\nFor the 2004 season the organization brought in former North York Astros coach Jorge Armua. He signed Ottawa Wizards top goalscorer Kevin Nelson, added Charles Gbeke, Blazenko Bekavac, Saša Milaimović and Brazilian Edmilson de Carvalho Barbosa to his roster. Armua repeated Hamilton`s previous success by once again claiming the Western Conference title and securing a playoff berth. In the postseason the Thunder faced Toronto Croatia in the semi-finals, but were defeated by a score of 2-0. Armua resumed his duties as head coach for Hamilton for the 2005 season. Where he once again added more silverware to Hamilton`s cabinet by successfully defending their Western Conference title for the third year in a row. The achievement allowed the Thunder Crew a bye to the semi-finals, where the club would face the Oakville Blue Devils - unfortunately Hamilton were deprived of five core players from the starting lineup because the players were affiliated with the Woodbridge Azzuri which consequently discontinued their association with Hamilton resulting in a shortage of players for the club which led to their defeat to Oakville. Once more Hamilton was without controversy as the club was forced out of Brian Timmis Stadium due to unpaid rental fees with a debt over $26,074.21 over several years, which resulted in team to relocate to the Ontario Soccer Centre in Vaughan.\n\nDuring the 2005 playoffs, the Hamilton Spectator revealed that Italo Ferrari, thought to be the owner of the team, was involved in personal bankruptcy proceedings with no assets, and debts of $2 million; Ferrari claimed to in fact \"not\" be the owner. Two weeks after the semifinal loss, the league announced the revocation of the franchise. On October 22, 2005 the CPSL Board of Governors revoked the franchise of the Hamilton Thunder Soccer Club as a member of the CPSL. Top sales rep of the franchise was Gerry Fonzo, now a successful Director of Business Development and Client Retention at the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.\n\n\n"}

The premiere of the first short film with Mole took place at the Venice Film Festival in 1957. Since its inception, the cartoon has gained enormous popularity in many Central European countries, as well as India, China, Kazakhstan, Croatia, Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Iran, Iraq, and Japan.\n\nKrtek was first seen in 1956 in Prague, when Miler wanted to create a children's cartoon about how flax is processed. He wanted a strong Disney influence to the cartoon by choosing an animal for the leading role, and decided to pick a mole after stumbling over a molehill during a walk. The first film, called \"\"Jak krtek ke kalhotkám přišel\"\" (\"\"How the mole got his trousers\"\"), had its premiere at the Venice Film Festival in 1957, where it was awarded two Golden Lions. Production for further episodes started in 1963 and since then, around 50 episodes have been created.\n\nThe first episode of the cartoon was narrated, but Miler wanted the cartoon to be understood in every country of the world, so he decided to use his daughters as voice actors, reducing the speech to short non-figurative exclamations in order to express the mole's feelings and world perception. Miler's daughters also became the bottleneck of the creation process as they were the ones who got to see the whole film first, thus Miler was able to decide whether the message of the movie was able to get to children or not.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the cartoons were transmitted by the BBC with English narration by Colin Jeavons.\n\nOn May 16, 2011 a plush toy of Krtek was present on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour, where it accompanied the U.S. astronaut Andrew Feustel, whose wife is of Czech ancestry, on the STS-134 mission.\n\nIn May 2012, Bloomberg announced that Apple Inc. is planning to help Krtek enter the $21 billion U.S. toy market for the first time. Exporting the six-decade-old “Little Mole” through new media is a first step toward establishing the most popular Czech animated icon in America to spur sales of books, movies, and toys.\n\nMole was the mascot for the 2015 European Athletics Indoor Championships in Prague, and was subsequently used to promote the Federation's Athletics for Children programme.\n\nOn May 23, 2019 Alfa Romeo Racing, a Formula One team, announced Krtek as the new team partner. Frédéric Vasseur, principal of the team, said that the goal of the partnership is to capture the imagination of hundreds of thousands of children and get them closer to the sport using Krtek's big follower base all over the world. Mole's iconic figure is appearing on the sidepods of the cars for the rest of the 2019 season.\n\nMusic plays an important role in the cartoons, since the characters almost never utter more than emotional sounds, the most common of which is \"Hello!\" (\"Ahoj\" in Czech). The original series' music uses acoustic and electric musical instruments, rather than synthesized ones.\n\nComposers:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2022684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022684", "title": "Racism in Russia", "text": "Racism in Russia\n\nRacism in Russia appears mainly in the form of negative attitudes and actions by some Russians toward people who are not ethnically Russian. Traditionally, Russian racism includes antisemitism and Tatarophobia, as well as hostility towards various ethnicities of the Caucasus, Central Asia, East Asia and Africa. In 2006, Amnesty International reported that racism in Russia was \"out of control.\" Russia also has one of the highest immigration rates in Eastern Europe.\n\nIn 2006, Amnesty International reported that racism in Russia was \"out of control.\" Russia also has one of the highest immigration rates in Eastern Europe.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2008, there were more than 350 racist murders, and Verkhovsky, the leader of the anti-racist SOVA organization, estimated that around 50% of Russians thought that ethnic minorities should be expelled from their region. Vladimir Putin meanwhile was deeply critical of the view that Russia should be \"for ethnic Russians\", citing the need to maintain harmony in a multiethnic federation. Western commentators have noted that during this period, racist and ultranationalist groups may have been the most significant right-wing opposition to Putin's government.\n\nOn 20 April 2011, Konstantin Poltoranin, spokesman for Federal Migratory Service, was fired after saying the \"survival of the white race was at stake.\"\n\nOn 24 October 2013, speaking during the \"Poedinok\" programme on the Rossia 1 television channel, the leader of Russia's extreme nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, known for his headline-grabbing outbursts, called for imposing limits on the birth rate in the Muslim-dominated North Caucasus region of Russia, and restricting the movement of people from that region across the country. These outbursts occurred shortly after the terrorist attack in Volgograd, which left several Russians dead. Zhirinovsky later apologized for his words.\nDuring the programme, there was a live population poll conducted via text messaging and internet. Zhirinovsky won that popular vote, with over 140 thousand Russians voting in favour of him. Some Russian nationalists believe the best way to stop the uptick in Muslim migration is by using oppressive tactics to \"stem the tide\". In 2006, in the town of Kondopoga, Karelian republic, a brawl in a café involving Chechen migrants and local Russians turned into a massive riot that lasted for several days.\n\nOfficial attitudes towards African people were generally neutral during the Soviet Union, because of its internationalist agenda. As a part of its support of decolonization of Africa, the Soviet Union offered free education for citizens of African states. African students (as well as other foreign students) were placed in many higher education institutions throughout the country, most famously at Peoples' Friendship University of Russia, then known as the Patrice Lumumba Peoples' Friendship University, after the Congolese revolutionary and prime minister.\n\nIn recent survey, Moscow Protestant Chaplaincy found that over half of Africans in Moscow had been physically attacked in the past. Attacks in Moscow Metro are common, and \"monkey\" insults are so frequent that students have ceased reporting them.\n\nIn 2010, Jean Sagbo became the first black man in Russia to be elected to government. He is a municipal councilor in the village of Novozavidovo, north of Moscow.\n\nPosters and toys depicting Barack Obama as a monkey have been sold in Russian stores in 2015, and Member of Duma Irina Rodnina has publicly posted a picture showing Obama with a banana on Twitter.\n\nA Tatar owned supermarket in Tatarstan sold calendars with images of American President Obama depicted as a monkey and initially refused to apologize for selling the calendar. They were then forced to issue an apology later.\n\nIn mid-2016, after tensions rose between the U.S. and Russia, a Tatarstan ice cream factory produced \"Obamka\" (little Obama) ice cream with packaging showing a black child wearing an earring; the move was seen as an illustration of both anti-Americanism in Russia and enduring, Soviet-era racism in the country. The company, which stated that the ice cream was not intended to be political, halted production of the line shortly after the controversy arose.\n\nTatarophobia towards Crimean Tatars was state-enforced during the Soviet era through the racially-based special settlement system, which curfewed the deported Crimean Tatar nation into small perimeters within Central Asia and the Mari ASSR and deprived them of a variety of civil liberties that other peoples had. While no longer officially a state-mandated institution, prejudice and negative attitudes against Crimean Tatars remains pervasive throughout government and society; a notable example being when Russian consul Vladimir Andreev demanded that none of the invited Russian citizens attend the debut of \"Haytarma\", a film about Crimean Tatar twice Hero of the Soviet Union Amet-khan Sultan, claiming that the film could not possibly be accurate because it was directed by a Crimean Tatar.\n\nIn Russia, the word \"Caucasian\" is a collective term referring to anyone descended from the native ethnic groups of the Caucasus. In Russian slang, Peoples of the Caucasus are called \"black\", despite the fact that of its Georgian, Dagestani, Chechen etc. population is fair-skinned while the Azeri and Armenian are darker toned; this name calling comes from their relatively darker features. While the word \"black\" in itself is not racist, the racist synonym for it is \"chernozhopy\" (черножо́пый, trans. \"black arsed\"). Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the rise of the Muslim population in Russia and the Second Chechen War, many Russian radical nationalists have associated Islam and Muslims with terrorism and domestic crimes.\n\nOn 21 April 2001, there was a pogrom in a market in Moscow's Yasenevo District against merchants from the Caucasus. Ethnically motivated attacks against Armenians in Russia have grown so common that the president of Armenia, Robert Kocharyan, raised the issue with high-ranking Russian officials. In September 2006, major ethnic tensions between Russians and Caucasians took place in Kondopoga. In 2006, the crisis in Georgia–Russia relations resulted in the deportation of Georgians from Russia. The Russian side explained the process as law enforcement towards illegal immigrants, whereas the Georgian government accused Russia of ethnic cleansing. The European Court of Human Rights concluded that the detention and collective expulsion of Georgian nationals in 2006 violated the European Convention of Human Rights and ruled, in 2019, that Russia had to pay 10 million Euros in compensation.\n\nIn December 2010, there was a massive outbreak of hostility towards Caucasians, culminating in nationalist protests at Manezhnaya Square in Moscow and in other cities. The trigger was the murder of Egor Sviridov, a Russian association football fan, in a street fight on 6 December. On 11 December, thousands of nationalist rioters, outside the Moscow Kremlin building, screamed racist phrases, cried for a \"Russia for Russians\" and a \"Moscow for Muscovites,\" attacked Caucasians and other minority groups who passed by, and some – including children as young as fourteen – made the Nazi salute. The next day, a similar riot was held in Rostov-on-Don, and afterwards, the city's government banned Caucasians from performing Lezginka, their traditional dance, in the city. Afterwards, the police chief in Moscow said that civil liberties were a hindrance in security and that migration should be restricted. Vladimir Kvachkov, a major Russian nationalist leader of the organization People's Liberation Front of Russia (which says its major goal is to \"free\" Russia from Caucasian and Hebrew \"occupiers\"), made the following statement: \"We Russian nationalists, the initiators of the people's front, we are telling you that the events of December 11 are the beginning of the revolutionary changes in Russia, the first outbursts of the approaching Russian revolution... You are the ones who can participate in it.\"\n\nIn 2016, Kyrgyzstan's President Almazbek Atambayev urged Russians to show respect to his countrymen after an assault on two migrants in Moscow.\n\nOn 11 January 2006, Alexander Koptsev burst into Bolshaya Bronnaya Synagogue in Moscow and stabbed eight people with a knife. In March, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison. In 2008, allegations of blood libel appeared in posters in Novosibirsk. The Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia expressed their concern about a rising number of attacks targeting Jews, calling it part of \"a recent surge in anti-Semitic manifestations\" in Russia.\n\nAmid hostility towards migrant workers, around 600 Vietnamese were rounded up in Moscow and placed in tents while waiting to be deported from Russia in August 2013.\n\nOn 9 January 2009 a group of strangers in Moscow stabbed a Vietnamese student named Tang Quoc Binh who was 21 years old and the wounds were fatal resulting in his death on 10 January.\n\nOn October 2004 Russian skinheads stabbed and beat a Vietnamese student named Vu Anh Tuan, killing him. The Vietnamese was Vu Anh Tuan and was 20 years old when he was killed in St. Petersburg, on October 2006 the 17 skinheads who were on trial for his murder were acquitted by a court.\n\nIn Moscow on in 2008 group of young men stabbed a Vietnamese woman who was 35 years old and she died of her wounds.\n\nIn 2005 in Moscow three Russians stabbed a 45-year-old Vietnamese man named Quan to death\n\nA protest was held by 100 Vietnamese against the murder of Vu Anh Tuan and a protestor said \"We came to study in this country, which we thought was a friend of Vietnam. We do not have drunken fights, we do not steal, we do not sell drugs and we have the right to protection from bandits,\".\n\nIn Moscow on 25 December 2004 a crowd of people used clubs and knives to attack 2 Vietnamese students at the Moscow Energy Institute, Nguyen Tuan Anh and Nguyen Hoang Anh and they suffered severe injuries and were hospitalized.\n\nAfter it was announced that Russia will host 2018 FIFA World Cup, a head of UEFA FARE Monitoring Centre, Dr Rafał Pankowski accused the Russian Football Union of downplaying racist chants in stadiums, saying: \"Nazi slogans are common in many Russian stadiums. Matches are often interrupted with racist chants aimed at black players.\" More than 100 incidents took place 2012–2014.\n\nCameroonian player André Amougou constantly suffered racism while playing for Lokomotiv Moscow. As Zenit Saint Petersburg kicked off their 2006/2007 Russian Premier League campaign against visitors Saturn Moscow Oblast, Brazilian footballer Antônio Géder was received with a chorus of monkey chants at Petrovsky Stadium. In March 2008, black players of French side Marseille — including André Ayew, Charles Kaboré and Ronald Zubar — were targeted by ultras of Zenit Saint Petersburg. Zenit ultras were later warned by police in Manchester not to repeat their behaviour ahead of the 2008 UEFA Cup Final. Zenit's coach Dick Advocaat revealed that when they attempted to sign Mathieu Valbuena, a Frenchman, many fans asked \"Is he a negro?\" Also Serge Branco, who played for Krylia Sovetov Samara, accused Zenit's staff of racism, saying: \"Each time I play in St Petersburg I have to listen to racist insults from the stands. Zenit bosses do not do anything about it which makes me think they are racists too.\" On 20 August 2010, Peter Odemwingie of Lokomotiv Moscow signed a 3-year contract with Premier League team West Bromwich Albion. Later, photographs showed Lokomotiv Moscow fans celebrating the sale of Odemwingie through the use of racist banners including the image of a banana with text \"Thanks West Brom.\"\n\nOn 21 March 2011, during a game away at Zenit Saint Petersburg, a banana was held by one of the fans near Roberto Carlos of Russian Premier League club Anzhi Makhachkala as the footballer was taking part in a flag-raising ceremony. In June, in a match away at Krylia Sovetov Samara, Roberto Carlos received a pass from the goalkeeper and was about to pass it when a banana was thrown onto the pitch, landing nearby. The 38-year-old Brazilian picked it up and threw it by the sidelines, walking off the field before the final whistle and raising two fingers at the stands, indicating this was the second such incident.\n\nLokomotiv Moscow were involved in another incident on 18 March 2012, when a banana was thrown at Anzhi Makhachkala defender Christopher Samba during at a match at the Lokomotiv Stadium.\n\nIn October 2013, during the second half of the match, between Manchester City and PFC CSKA Moscow, Yaya Touré, a star midfielder for City from Ivory Coast, walked up to the referee, Ovidiu Hategan, and angrily pointed at CSKA fans making monkey chants and shouting abuse toward him and his black teammates. The game continued and, according to Touré, so did the abuse.\n\nOn 9 February 2004, a group of neo-Nazi skinheads stabbed a nine-year-old Tajik girl, Khursheda Sultanova, to death in Saint Petersburg. In 2006, the Saint Petersburg Agency for Journalistic Investigations revealed suspected perpetrators among the members of the \"Mad Crowd\" gang.\n\nOn 14 June 2011, the Saint Petersburg City Court sentenced 12 members of the gang led by Alexei Voevodin and Artyom Prokhorenko for their roles in dozens of racist attacks.\n\nOn 15 December 2008, Artur Ryno and Pavel Skachevsky were sentenced to penal labour for 10 years each for the murder of 19 foreigners. They were placed on the list of people banned from entering the United Kingdom, remaining the only Russians on the list. The reason given is that they are \"Leaders of a violent gang that beat migrants and posted films of their attacks on the internet. Considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by fomenting serious criminal activity and seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts.\" A judge who conducted the trial, Eduard Chuvashov, was gunned down on 12 April 2010, four days after he added two years to the 20-year prison sentence of a member of their gang.\n\n\nOn 21 August 2006, a home–made bomb exploded in Moscow at the Cherkizovsky Market, which is frequented by foreign merchants. On 15 May 2008, eight people of Russian radical nationalist organization Spas were found guilty for their roles in the attack that left 14 dead. Semyon Charny from the Moscow Bureau for Human Rights says: \"The fact that this case found its way to court, and the example of people sentenced to life for the Cherkizovo market blast shows that we are moving in the right direction – but there's still a lot to do.\"\n\n\"Execution of a Tajik and a Dagestani\" () is a video clip that was distributed in the Russian Internet segment in August 2007, showing the beheading of a Russian citizen of Dagestani origin and the shooting of a Tajik immigrant by Russian neo-nazis.\n\nThe video sparked active discussions in the Russian media. On 17 March 2008, the District Court of Novgorod ruled the video as extremist, and banned its distribution in the Russian Federation.\n\nThe video was posted on behalf of the National Socialist Party of Rus' () on the personal livejournal blog of Adygean college student Viktor Milnikov.\nAfter a few days, he was arrested and later sentenced to one year of corrective labour by Maykop court.\n\nOn 5 June 2008, scenes of decapitation on video were identified as authentic by the Russian Investigation Committee.\nOn the same day, one of the victims on the footage was identified by his relatives as Shamil Odamanov, a native of Dagestan.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2022690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022690", "title": "Akilathirattu Ammanai", "text": "Akilathirattu Ammanai\n\nAkilathirattu Ammanai (; \"akilam\" (\"world\"), \"thirattu\" (\"collection\"), \"ammanai\" (\"ballad\")), also called Thiru Edu (\"venerable book\"), is the main religious text of the Tamil belief system Ayyavazhi. The title is often abbreviated to Akilam or Akilathirattu.\n\nAkilam includes more than 15,000 verses and is the largest collection of Ammanai literature in Tamil as well as one of the largest works in Tamil constructed by a single author.\n\nAuthor Hari Gopalan Citar states in the text that he wrote this book on a Friday, the twenty-seventh day of the Tamil month of Karthikai (13 December) in the year 1839 CE. The author claims that God woke him up during his sleep and commissioned him to record his dictation. \"Akilathirattu\" was recorded on palm leaves until 1939, when it was printed.\n\nAccording to the author, the book is the story of God coming in this age, the Kali Yukam or Iron Age, to rule the world by transforming it into the Dharma Yukam. This story of faith weaves together the historical facts about Ayya Vaikundar and his activities with reinterpretations of episodes from the Hindu Puranas (mythologies) and Itihasas (epics). It is presented as if Vishnu is narrating the whole story to his consort Lakshmi.\n\nThough the Citar Hari Gopalan wrote the book Akilam, he claimed that he did not know anything about the contents of the book. He woke up in the morning as usual and he didn't know what he had written the day before. Another legend says that he began it that night and continued through the following days. Others say that it was written beginning on Friday, 27th Karthikai (Tamil Calendar) 1016 M.E, and completed on the seventeenth day on the second Sunday of Margazhi (Tamil Calendar) 1016 M.E.\n\nWhen Ayya Vaikundar avatar was completed, God reached Vaikundam. It contained the regulations of the Ayyavazhi sect. As per the instructions found there in Akilam, Ayyavazhi was preached by the Citars far and wide.\n\n\"Akilam\" is in two parts: the first is an account of the ages preceding that of the present age, the \"Kali Yukam\"; and the second is an account of the activities of Ayya Vaikundar leading up to his attaining Vaikundam.\n\n\"Akilathirattu\" is written as a poem in the Tamil language. The narration alternates between two subgenres called \"viruttam\" and \"natai\". Both subgenres employ poetic devices like alliteration and hyperbatons. The text contains seventeen sections, and more than 15,000 verses. In a typical Ammanai style, Akilam maintains more than one context for its verses throughout the text. While the floating ideas of the lines could be comparatively easily communicated, the underlying theme couldn't be understood unless the background and culture are understood, specifically a foundational knowledge of the Hindu pantheon of gods, the Hindu scriptures, Dharmic concepts and philosophy, and other rudiments of the religion.\n\nThe texts written by Hari Gopalan Citar are damaged and thus it is difficult to read the contents. The texts are still preserved as relics by his descendants. There are three versions, which were copied from the first version:\n\n\nOf these three, the Panchalankuricchi Version is believed to have copied by from the main version by Hari Gopalan Citar. The other two versions were copied later. Apart from these the Nariyan vilai Version, Varampetran-pantaram Version, and Saravanantheri Version are the other early palm-leaf versions of Akilam.\n\nOther versions include the Palaramachandran version, the VTV, published twice, the Kalai Ilakkiya-peravai Version and the Vivekanandan Version. But of these, the Ayya Vaikundar Thirukkudumbam version is often criticized for adding and removing additional verses from various versions. Some argue that over 300 pages were adulterated. Thirukkudumbam claims that these additional lines were added from the early palm-leaf versions (Panchalankuricchi Version and Kottangadu Version), which are believed to have been missing from Akilam. This version is not widely accepted.\n\nAll the release versions except the Palaramachandran version organize the contents into seventeen sections as per the Thiru Eadu-vasippu partition. The Sentrathisai Ventraperumal version which was released in 1965 includes more than two-thousand verses not found in other versions. The Palaramachandran version is the widely accepted and the largest circulated version.\n\nThe book focuses on the devotion to Vaikundar, considered to be an aspect of the God Vishnu. It is a poetic narrative in Tamil intended to be an excellent compilation of the various aspects of Indian mythology and beliefs about God.\n\nThe first eight chapters of the book narrate the events starting from the creation of the Universe to the time exactly before the incarnation of Vaikundar. The ninth chapter describes in detail the events taking place in the divine plan during the incarnation of Vaikundar. The last eight chapters focus on the legendary, empirical, historical and mythical aspects pertaining to the life of Vaikundar.\n\nThe book starts with the explanation given by Vishnu to his consort Lakshmi about the evolution of Universe and of human beings. It is said that there is a total of eight aeons, or yugas, and we are currently in the seventh yuga called Kali Yuga, the age of deterioration. It is believed that for each yuga there is a demon that will be destroyed by Vishnu. In the first yuga, Kroni was born. Vishnu fragmented him into six pieces and each fragment will incarnate as demon in each Yuga. The first four yugas are said to be the Neetiya Yuga, Chatura Yuga, Nedu Yuga and Kretha Yuga. These four yugas do not have parallels in the mainstream Hinduism.\n\nThe fifth yuga is said to be the Treta Yuga in which the Lord Rama incarnated as human. The sixth yuga is the Dvapara Yuga, and there is a short but striking description of the life of Krishna and the Bharatha war. Additionally, there is said to be another event called the birth of Santror or noble people at the closure of Dvapara Yuga.\n\nKali Yuga, the seventh Yuga begins when the evil spirit called Kali (not to be confused with Kaali, the mother goddess) was born. Kali is believed to be cognate with the modern human beings. Then was born the Neesan, the demon for the Kali Yuga. It is said that this demon became the king of earth in various places and tortured the lives of the Santror. Because of this Lord Vishnu advised Neesan to stop torturing the Santror. But he won't agree to Vishnu and would prefer to die rather than giving up. In order to stop the rule of Neesan and to bring an end to Kali-yuga, Vishnu made a plan to make Vaikundar incarnate as human.\n\nVaikundar is believed to be the Son of Vishnu and Lakshmi. He was beget inside the sea and sent as a human into the land. From the point of incarnation of Vaikundar, it is said that he was made the supreme of all godhead, and will destroy Neesan and also the evil Kali Yuga. It is also said that he will take all righteous people with him into the Vaikundam in the eighth yuga called as Dharma Yukam. Also, nothing is said about the period which follows Dharma yuga, which means that timeline is linear, and not circular as believed inside mainstream Hinduism.\n\nThe \"Akilam\" is divided into seventeen parts:\n\nAkilam teaches a set of values that are theological, sociological and philosophical. Of these, the ideas promoted by Akilam spans throughout the various teachings found in Hindu scriptures and present Hinduism in the first half and at the second, a set of revolutionary teachings, in all aspects were focussed. The theological teachings revolves around the supremacy of Vaikundar while the sociological teachings mainly focus on breaking up the inequalities prevalent in the society. The Philosophical ideas mainly focus the 'Ultimate oneness' of nature and all living beings.\n\nAll the major Hindu deities namely Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Sarasvati, Lakshmi, Parvati, Skanda, and Ganesha are mentioned directly in the mythology throughout the book. Also there is an indirect mention about Bible, Allah and Quran inside the book. A reference found in Akilam about Jesus is more direct than indirect. Also the book seems to stress that all texts and scriptures are true and have a share about the truth of the Divine. It is notable that Akilam is heavily against creating religions as it does not mention the term 'religion' at least once anywhere in the text and do refers only to God-heads, concepts and scriptures.\n\nIt is said that social inequality and destruction of caste ethics are the main aspects of the Kali Yuga. So the entire book focuses on social equality and strictly against \"Jati\" or the Indian caste system.

The project was never realized.\n\nThe word \"Volk\" had a particular resonance in Nazi thinking. The term völkisch movement, which can be translated to English as \"the people's movement\" or \"the folkish movement\", derives from ' but also implies a particularly racial undertone. Before the First World War, \"völkisch\" thought had developed an attitude to the arts as the German '; that is, from an organically linked Aryan or Nordic community (\"\"), racially unpolluted and with its roots in the German soil of the Heimat (homeland).\n\nJust as Augustus's \"Domus\" on the Palatine was connected to the Temple of Apollo Palatinus, so Hitler's palace was to have been connected by a cryptoporticus to the Volkshalle, which filled the entire north side of the forum. This truly enormous building was, according to Albert Speer, inspired by Hadrian's Pantheon, which Hitler visited privately on May 7, 1938. But Hitler's interest in and admiration for the Pantheon predated this visit, since his sketch of the Volkshalle dates from about 1925. Hermann Giesler records a conversation he had with Hitler in the winter of 1939–40, when Hitler was recalling his “Roman Impressions” (\"\"):\n\nHitler's impressions of the Roman Pantheon were revived when on June 24, 1940, he made a tour of selected buildings in Paris, with the German architects Albert Speer and Hermann Giesler and sculptor Arno Breker, including the Paris Panthéon, which seems to have disappointed him, independently recorded by Giesler and Breker.\n\nThe sketch of the Volkshalle given by Hitler to Speer shows a traditional gabled pronaos supported by ten columns, a shallow rectangular intermediate block and behind it the domed main building. Giesler notes that the pronaos of the temple in Hitler's sketch is reminiscent of Hadrian's Pantheon and of the style of Friedrich Gilly or Karl Friedrich Schinkel. However, there was little about Speer's elaboration of the sketch that might be termed Doric, except perhaps for the triglyphs in the entablature, supported by the geminated red granite columns with their Egyptian palm-leaf capitals, previously employed by Speer in the portico outside Hitler's study on the garden side of the new Chancellery.\n\nSpeer's Monster-Building () was to be the capital's most important and impressive building in terms of its size and symbolism. Visually it was to have been the architectural centrepiece of Berlin as the world capital (Welthauptstadt). Its dimensions were so large that it would have dwarfed every other structure in Berlin, including those on the north-south axis itself. The oculus of the building's dome, in diameter, would have accommodated the entire rotunda of Hadrian's Pantheon and the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. The dome of the Volkshalle was to rise from a massive granite podium and high, to a total inclusive height of . The diameter of the dome, , was to be exceeded, much to Speer's annoyance, by the diameter of Giesler's new domed railway station at the east end of Munich's east-west axis. It was to be greater in diameter than Speer's Volkshalle.\n\nThe resemblance of the Volkshalle to the Pantheon is far more obvious when their interiors are compared. The large niche at the north end of the Volkshalle was to be surfaced with gold mosaic and to enclose an eagle high, beneath which was situated Hitler's tribunal. From here he would address 180,000 listeners, some standing in the central round arena, others seated in three concentric tiers of seats crowned by one hundred marble pillars, high, which rose to meet the base of the coffered ceiling suspended from steel girders sheathed on the exterior with copper.\n\nThe three concentric tiers of seats enclosing a circular arena in diameter owe nothing to the Pantheon but resemble the seating arrangements in Ludwig Ruff's Congress Hall at Nuremberg, which was modeled on the Colosseum. Other features of the Volkshalle's interior are clearly indebted to Hadrian's Pantheon: the coffered dome, the pillared zone, which here is continuous, except where it flanks the huge niche on the north side. The second zone in the Pantheon, consisting of blind windows with intervening pilasters, is represented in Speer's building by a zone above the pillars consisting of uniform, oblong shallow recesses. The coffered dome rests on this zone. The design and size of the external decoration of this Volkshalle, are all exceptional and call for explanations that do not apply to community halls planned for Nazi fora in other German cities.\n\nThe temple-like nature of the domed building was noted by Speer, who surmised that the building was ultimately intended for public worship of Hitler, his successors and the German Reich, that is, it was to be a dynastic temple/palace complex of the kind Augustus built on the Palatine, where his modest house was connected to the temple of Apollo.\n\nHitler's aspirations to hegemony over Europe and the establishment of the New Order, already evident from architectural and decorative features of the new Chancellery, are even more clearly expressed here. External symbols suggest that the domed hall was where Hitler as cosmocrat () would appear before his Herrenvolk: On top of the dome's lantern was the German heraldic eagle clutching the globe of the Earth ('). This symbolism was well known in imperial Roman iconography, for example, the restored statue of Claudius holding a ball and eagle in his right hand. The vast dome, on which it rested, as with Hadrian's Pantheon, symbolically represented the vault of the sky spanning Germany's empire. The globe on the dome's lantern was enhanced and emphasized by two monumental sculptures by Breker, each 15 metres high, which flanked the north façade of the building: at its west end Atlas supporting the heavens, at its east end Tellus supporting the Earth. Both mythological figures were chosen by Hitler himself. Giesler says that Speer was wrong to represent the Volkshalle as a symbol of World Domination ('). Speer in his \"Playboy\" magazine interview states:\n\nNevertheless, Giesler remarked that Hitler never made plans for world domination and that to suggest as much is not only nonsense (') but 'Speer Rubbish' (').\n\nRobert Harris's 1992 novel \"Fatherland\" takes place in an alternate history in which Nazi Germany won World War II and in which the Volkshalle was actually built. Several of the book's scenes take place in and around it. Harris carefully used Speer's plans, with the building being depicted as being 300 m (1,000 ft) high. As depicted in the book, the building would indeed have had its own \"weather\", with the breathing and perspiration of 150,000 occupants precipitating in the high dome; but rather than considering this a problem, Nazi propaganda would boast of it. In a real-world corollary to the fiction concerning the Volkshalle, the indoors condensate characteristic imagined for the Volkshalle has actually been observed happening within the Kennedy Space Center's immense Vehicle Assembly Building, if its own massive dehumidification systems were not turned on.\n\nThe Volkshalle appears in the alternate history novel \"In the Presence of Mine Enemies\" by Harry Turtledove, being used for the lying in state for the deceased Führer, Kurt Haldweim.\n\nThe Volkshalle's image appears in the video game \"\", in an alternate 1960s in which (like the Fatherland novel) Nazi Germany won World War II.\n\nComputer-generated special effects are used to depict the Volkshalle in an alternate history Berlin in the TV production of \"The Man in the High Castle\". Multiple scenes in seasons two to four take place inside various parts of the Volkshalle. Unlike most other depictions of the Volkshalle, it was shown to have housed the Führer's Office and residence.\n\n\n\n"}

The original plan was that García Lorca's play would be translated into English by the British poet Alastair Raid and Hugh Ross, but Villa-Lobos immediately began setting the original Spanish text. It was composed partly in New York, partly in Paris, and was finished in 1956. \n\n\"Yerma\" was first performed by the Santa Fe Opera in Santa Fe, New Mexico on August 12, 1971 (erroneously reported in one source as July 12), and repeated just once, on August 18. The Santa Fé premiere was produced by Basil Langton, choreographed by José Limón, with scenery by Allen Charles Klein. Paintings by Giorgio de Chirico were projected on the walls during the intermissions.\n\nIn 1983 the opera was staged for the first time in Brazil, at the Teatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro, with Aurea Gomez and Benito Maresca, conducted by Mário Tavares, and in 1987 this Spanish-language opera was performed for the first time in a Spanish-speaking country, at the Teatro Solís in Montevideo. The title role was sung by the Mexican soprano María Luisa Tamez, supported by Brazilian tenor Benito Maresca and Uruguayan baritone Fernando Barabino. Staging was by Jorge Curi, and David Machado conducted. A concert version was presented from July 12–21, 1989 by Opera on the Move in the Queen Elizabeth Hall at the Southbank's Latin American Festival, \"Viva!\", with Anna Steiger in the title role and Odaline de la Martinez conducting, while the European staged premiere was given by the Bielefeld Opera in 1991. The opera was given its second staging in Brazil at the Teatro Amazonas in Manaus in April 2010. The lead roles were taken by Eliane Coelho, Marcelo Puente, Homero Velho, and Keila de Moraes. Marcelo de Jesus conducted.\n\nDespite the fact that it occurred twelve years after the composer's death, the Santa Fé premiere of \"Yerma\" attracted widespread attention from the press, not only from American publications like the \"New York Times\" and \"Newsweek\", but also from several Swiss newspapers and the Brazilian daily, \"Jornal do Brasil\", the latter no doubt because the opera was the work of the most distinguished Brazilian composer of his time.\n\n\n\n"}

Tafi's propensity to perform best in the harder races earned him the nickname \"Il Gladiatore\" (English: \"The Gladiator\").\n\nTafi specialized in the cobbled Spring Classics such as Paris–Roubaix which he won in 1999, and Tour of Flanders which he won in 2002. He won the Giro di Lombardia in 1996 and the Italian National Championship in 1998.\n\nThe most successful part of Tafi's career was spent with the Italian super-squad . In the 1996 edition of Paris–Roubaix the team put four of their riders in a breakaway at the front of the race: Johan Museeuw, Gianluca Bortolami, previous year's winner Franco Ballerini, and Tafi. Ballerini had a flat and was out of the lead group, but the other three powered their way to the finish.\n\nIn 1996 Tafi won the \"race of the falling leaves\" Giro di Lombardia, using his strength to overcome the climbs of the race. He said that his dream was to emulate his cycling hero fellow Italian Francesco Moser, which is to win Paris–Roubaix wearing the Tricolore jersey as the Italian National Champion. He accomplished this in his win in 1999. He won Paris–Tours in a long breakaway effort in 2000, foiling the sprinters' teams. After a few lacklustre years, he again shone in the 2002 edition of the hilly, cobbled classic Tour of Flanders. Having established himself in a front breakaway with the likes of Johan Museeuw, Peter van Petegem and teammate Daniele Nardello, he made attacks after attacks, finally taking advantage of a moment's hesitation between the two home favorites Museeuw and van Petegem to solo to the finish for the win.\n\nAfter the demise of the Mapei super-team, Tafi moved to the reformed under Bjarne Riis for the 2003 season. His time with team in 2004 also didn't re-ignite his performance. He finally moved to the new team for his last season in 2005. Tafi ended his career at the 2005 Paris–Roubaix, before retiring from the sport.\n\nHaving competed in amateur Masters races for several years, Tafi announced in October 2018 that he would seek a comeback in 2019 to race Paris–Roubaix on the twentieth anniversary of his victory. On 8 November 2018, it was reported that he had found a team to ride with and that would attempt to receive a wildcard invitation for the event. Would his comeback have been successful, he would have been 52 years old when riding the race. A collarbone fracture eventually put an end to Tafi's comeback plans.\n\nTafi's name was on the list of doping tests published by the French Senate on 24 July 2013 that were collected during the 1998 Tour de France and found positive for EPO when retested in 2004.\n"}

It is an unplanned reaction to a \"startling event\". It is an exception to the hearsay rule. The statement must be spontaneously made by the person (the declarant) while still under the stress of excitement from the event or condition. The subject matter and content of the statement must \"relate to\" event or condition. The statement could be a description or explanation (as required for present sense impression), or an opinion or inference. Examples include: \"Look out! We're going to crash!\" or \"I think he's crazy. He's shooting at us!\" The basis for this hearsay exception is the belief that a statement made under the stress is likely to be trustworthy and unlikely to be a premeditated falsehood. Compared to present sense impression, excited utterance is broader in scope for permitting a longer time lapse between event and statement, and a wider range of content in the statement.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, an excited utterance is a hearsay exception, and is admissible to prove the truth of the statement itself (e.g., in the case of the first quotation above, to prove that the vehicle the declarant was riding in was, in fact, about to crash). To prove the truth of the statement means to persuade the finder of fact to believe the affirmative sense of the statement. \"Truth\" here does not mean truth from the subjective point of view of the declarant or from the objective point of view of a reasonably prudent person. It simply refers to the affirmative assertion of the statement.\n\nSpontaneity of the declarant is a key to admissibility. An excited utterance does not have to be made at time of the startling event, but must be made while the declarant is still in a state of surprise or shock from the incident. The declarant's reflective powers must be stilled, meaning that, while making the statement, the declarant would not have had a chance to reflect upon the startling event, fabricate a purposefully false statement, and then say it. If the declarant is believed to have had time to reflect on the situation before making the statement, the statement would not be spontaneous and thus not an excited utterance. However, under certain circumstances, it is possible for days to have passed before the declarant fully reflects on the event, and \"unstills\" his or her reflective powers.\n\nSpontaneity is established by the declarant's demeanor, time lapse, and content of the statement. Declarant's appearance of calmness at time statement lessens admissibility. Time lapse between the startling event and the statement is a factor for both admissibility and weight. A statement made long after the event may be deemed less spontaneous than one made contemporaneously or shortly after. Outer limit of the permissible time lapse can only be determined from the circumstances of a particular case. For example, if a declarant made a statement six days after a car crash due to the extent of his injuries, admissibility of the statement is diminished because of the significant passage of time. However, if evidence shows that he was continuously distraught and did not yet have a chance to reflect upon the crash, the statement could be admissible but may have less weight than if the statement had been made one hour after the crash. A complete and detailed statement may infer the lack of spontaneity, as a narrative of a past completed event would require the declarant's reflection and organization. A similar case involved a woman who had been in a coma for thirty days following a car crash. When she awoke and was told what had happened she exclaimed \"I must have fallen asleep!\" At trial, her statement was admitted even though a month had passed because the startling event was perceived to be the telling of the news, as opposed to the crash itself.\n\n"}

The game is based on the \"Star Trek\" TV show \"\".\n\nGameplay is a mix between real-time tactics and space combat simulation. The game allows simultaneous control of up to six different ships from any of the four main combatant powers in the Dominion War - the Federation, the Klingons, the Cardassians and the Dominion. Missions include both primary and secondary objectives that allow a multitude of solutions for completion. To this end, before most missions, players may choose their ships, captains and accessories from a range of available personnel and ship classes.\n\nCompleting each mission earns the player credits, which can be used between missions to purchase new ships, more experienced captains or more powerful ship upgrades. Captains gain experience points for every mission they complete, and the more experience points they earn, the more competent they become. If a captain's ship is destroyed, although that captain will still be available for selection for the next mission, his or her experience points will have reverted to zero.\n\nThe player can issue commands to either each ship individually, or the fleet as a whole. They can also divide their fleet up into small units and issue separate commands to each unit. Players can choose how their ships attack the enemies by selecting from several pre-set patterns, and can also select what part of the enemy ship to focus their attack on (shields, engines, weapons or general). The player can also choose to divert power on their own ships from one system to another at any time. Players can also utilize transporters to send, for example, a team of engineers to help fix a damaged vessel quickly, or a team of troops to commandeer an enemy vessel.\nThe game can be played from either side of the conflict; the Federation/Klingon alliance or the Cardassian/Dominion alliance. Depending on which side the player chooses, the levels, missions and overall objectives are very different.\n\nIn the game's online multiplayer mode, up to 48 ships can compete in a single game. Available game modes include \"Free-for-all\"; \"Domination\", \"Find the Founder\", \"Capture\" and \"Hold and Conquest\".\n\n\"Dominion Wars\" is set roughly over the course of seasons five, six and seven of \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\", in which the Federation and their allies battle against the invading Dominion forces.\n\nEach mission is introduced by (voiced by Barry Jenner).\n\nThe game begins shortly after Gul Dukat has betrayed his allies in Starfleet and joined the Dominion (see \"In Purgatory's Shadow\" and \"By Inferno's Light\"). This move has prompted the Federation and the Klingon Empire to form an alliance in anticipation of the seemingly unavoidable war. Admiral Ross points out that the Cardassians are still bitter about some of the defeats they suffered at the hands of the Maquis (rogue Federation resistance fighters) several years previously, during the border disputes after the Federation-Cardassian Treaty. Starfleet believe that now the Cardassians have the Jem'Hadar backing them up, they will try to wipe out any Maquis settlements in the Badlands. As Starfleet is using the Maquis to transport civilians from Cardassian space, they head into the area to escort the ships. Having successfully evacuated the civilians, Starfleet must now move to defend against a Dominion offensive on Deep Space 9 itself. As they are outnumbered and unable to adequately defend the station, Starfleet have decided to abandon it temporarily, with the aim of recapturing it at a later date. However, before they leave, they activate a cloaked mine field at the entrance to the wormhole, preventing any Dominion reinforcements from coming through (see \"\").\n\nAs the war is now in full swing, Starfleet is continually finding itself outmaneuvered by the Dominion, who seem to know everything Starfleet is doing. The reason for this is a massive sensor array in a remote region of space near Betazed, hidden in an asteroid belt. Starfleet decides that to have any chance in the war, they must destroy the array. Having done so, however, it soon becomes apparent that even without that tactical advantage, the Dominion are building ships much faster than either Starfleet or the Klingons can. A Klingon task force is dispatched to attack and cripple a Dominion shipyard, but a Dominion fleet is simultaneously sent to attack the now defenceless Klingon border. As such, Starfleet must race to get in touch with the Klingons and defend the borders until the Klingons return.\n\nStarfleet then receives word that the Cardassians are planning the public execution of Thomas Riker, a former Starfleet officer who joined the Maquis before being captured by the Cardassians and sentenced to life imprisonment. Refusing to allow his execution, Starfleet sets out to intercept the fleet taking Riker to Cardassia Prime. Having saved Riker, it is then revealed that the Dominion are breeding Jem'Hadar soldiers far faster than was initially thought. To counteract this, Starfleet target the Dominion's largest Ketracel white (a drug to which all Jem'Hadar are genetically addicted) facility in the sector.\n\nThe destruction of the Ketracel white facility slows the production of soldiers by 50%. However, the Dominion form a new and unexpected alliance with a powerful but mysterious race known as the Breen (see \"\" and \"\"). However, at the same time, a new starship has been commissioned by Starfleet, the \"USS Imperious\", an \"Achilles\"-class vessel, with Thomas Riker as captain. The introduction of this new vessel, coupled with the recent alliance with the Romulans (see \"In the Pale Moonlight\") means Starfleet are now ready to retake Deep Space 9 (see \"Favor the Bold\" and \"Sacrifice of Angels\").\n\nHaven retaken the station, Starfleet learns that the Dominion are once again building ships at a dangerous rate. As such, their largest shipyard is completely destroyed. At this stage, with little options left to them, the Dominion go on the offensive, launching a massive invasion of Earth, which Starfleet prevent. The Dominion forces then retreat back to Cardassia Prime to regroup, but the Federation, Klingons and Romulans decide to invade Cardassia, dealing a final blow to the Dominion and winning the war (see \"What You Leave Behind\").\n\nEach mission is introduced by either Gul Dukat (Marc Alaimo) or Weyoun (Jeffrey Combs).\n\nAs with the Federation missions, the game begins shortly after the formation of the Cardassian/Dominion alliance, with the Cardassians moving to wipe out the Maquis, who are attempting to flee the Badlands. Having destroyed the Maquis, the Dominion then move to save a Founder who has been located on a Klingon ship. Having done this, the Dominion are enraged with Starfleet's attempt to block the entrance to the wormhole with a blanket of cloaked mines, attempting to cut the Dominion off from their reinforcements in the Gamma Quadrant. As such, they decide that Deep Space 9 itself must be captured and the mine field destroyed before activation.\n\nHaving done so, the Dominion detect a series of Starfleet/Klingon task forces attempting to capture Dominion sensor arrays and shipyards. As such, they send a fleet to block the attacks. However, it is revealed that there was never any intention of attacking the arrays - the entire mission was a feint to catch the Dominion off-guard so Starfleet could rescue Thomas Riker. Now Riker has been placed in charge of a new class of ship, the \"Achilles\"-class \"USS Imperious\". The Dominion thus set out to kill him and destroy the new ship. Having successfully done so, the Dominion then send a fleet of Cardassian ships to capture a sensor array. However, upon reaching the array, the Cardassians hand it over to Starfleet and then do the same thing with Deep Space 9. Dissatisfied with their place in the new alliance with the Breen, the Cardassians have abandoned the Dominion and joined with the Federation/Klingon/Romulan alliance (see \"The Changing Face of Evil\"). As such, the Dominion determine to destroy the Cardassians as a sign of their strength. They begin to annihilate Cardassian colonies and settlements, and then destroy Deep Space 9 itself.\n\nWith the destruction of Deep Space 9, reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant pour through the wormhole and the Alpha Quadrant forces retreat. The Dominion decide to attack the Klingon and Romulans first, destroying their borders and then invading both homeworlds simultaneously. With this accomplished, only the Federation stands against the Dominion. It is determined that Starfleet's main offensive starbase must be destroyed to ensure no major resistance can be launched. With this done, only one objective remains - the invasion of Earth. A massive assault is launched and the Dominion invade the planet, crippling Starfleet and the Federation and taking complete control of the Alpha Quadrant.\n\n\"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Dominion Wars\" received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\n\"Eurogamer\"s Tom Bramwell called it \"a fairly bland, totally linear strategy romp through space by the numbers.\" He praised the online multiplayer mode and graphics, but was critical of the overly complicated controls and several recurring bugs, such as commands not registering with ships and a bug which made mid-level saves impossible in the initial release version of the game (although he acknowledged a patch had been released to fix this). He concluded that \"\"Star Trek: Dominion Wars\" is an interesting, occasionally exciting game that suffers from a few notable flaws. It's not really an accurate portrayal of the final series of \"DS9\" because it's so faceless, but it's pretty good in its own right. If you think the bugs and plodding pace won't trouble you too much, and you like the idea of piloting a band of huge starships around the universe, you could do worse than to check it out.\"\n\nGameSpot's Bruce Grey was highly critical of the amount of bugs in the initial release version of the game (\"Lockups, crashes, bizarre video effects, saved games that disappear for no reason--all of these issues plagued the game when it hit store shelves\"). He criticized the lack of a single-player skirmish mode, as well as the rigid linearity of the game. However, he praised the graphics, sounds and camera control. He concluded that \"\"Dominion Wars\" does a nice job of capturing the feel of the \"Deep Space Nine\" universe, and the show's fans will find a lot to like about it as a result. But gamers who are interested in a general space strategy game might find the strategy elements a bit thin. If you're a big fan of \"Deep Space Nine\" and just want to fight for the future of Alpha Quadrant, and you also have some patience with potential technical problems, \"Dominion Wars\" is worthwhile. But if you want a comprehensive space combat strategy game, you should look elsewhere.\"\n\nIGN's Dan Adams felt that the game paled in comparison to the TV show; \"the game just doesn't hold the same interest as the show. It was just soulless compared to the vibrant portrayal of the situation in the show.\" He too praised the graphics and sound, but was highly critical of the interface and controls, and argued that the patches released to combat the bugs failed to do their job; \"even after all of the patches to fix what was a horribly buggy mess at release, the game still has a bunch of problems -- weird crashes, graphical glitches, a sticky interface and a scrolling feature that barely works just to name a few.\" He was also critical of the lack of tactical options, arguing that every level \"comes down to overpowering your enemies either by numbers or by equipping your ships with special weapons and shield enhancements.\"\n\n"}

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) at the age of 25.\n\nGray was born in Belgravia, London, in 1827 and lived most of his life in London. In 1842, he entered as a student at St. George's Hospital, London (then situated in Belgravia, now moved to Tooting), and he is described by those who knew him as a most painstaking and methodical worker, and one who learned his anatomy by the slow but invaluable method of making dissections for himself.\n\nWhile still a student, Gray secured the triennial prize of Royal College of Surgeons in 1848 for an essay entitled \"The Origin, Connexions and Distribution of nerves to the human eye and its appendages, illustrated by comparative dissections of the eye in other vertebrate animals.\" In 1852, at the early age of 25, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in the following year he obtained the Astley Cooper prize of three hundred guineas for a dissertation \"On the structure and Use of Spleen.”\n\nIn 1858, Gray published the first edition of \"Anatomy\", which covered 750 pages and contained 363 figures. He had the good fortune of securing the help of his friend Henry Vandyke Carter, a skilled draughtsman and formerly a demonstrator of anatomy at St. George's Hospital. Carter made the drawings from which the engravings were executed. The excellence of Carter's illustrations contributed greatly to the initial success of the book. This edition was dedicated to Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, Bart, FRS, DCL. A second edition was prepared by Gray and published in 1860. The book is still published under the title \"Gray's Anatomy\" and widely appreciated as an authoritative textbook for medical students.\n\nGray held successively the posts of demonstrator of \"Anatomy\", curator of the museum and Lecturer of Anatomy at St. George's Hospital and was in 1861 a candidate for the post of assistant surgeon.\n\nGray was struck by an attack of confluent smallpox, the most deadly type of the disease where individual lesions become so numerous that they join as a continuous, \"confluent\" sheet. He is assumed to have been infected due to his extended and meticulous caring for his ten-year-old nephew, Charles Gray, who did eventually recover. On the day he was to appear for an interview as a final candidate for a prestigious post at the St. George's Hospital, he died in London - 13 June 1861 - at the age of 34. He was buried at St James, Pancras and Highgate Cemetery. Gray had been vaccinated against smallpox as a child with one of the early forms of the vaccine.\n\n\n"}

It is largely a sequel to \"\", with the majority of events taking place before that film's ending. Like \"Legends of Metru Nui\", \"Web of Shadows\" is a prequel to the first film, \"\". This is the first Bionicle film to not be given a rating by the MPAA. It was released on DVD on October 11, 2005.\n\nIn the film, the Toa Metru return to their island city home of Metru Nui to rescue the Matoran populace whom they are sworn to protect; the Matoran all remain in a deep coma following the events of the previous film. Upon arrival, the Toa discover that the city has been overrun by spider-like creatures called Visorak, who capture the Toa and mutate them into beast-like creatures known as Hordika. The Toa Hordika work with a group of beings called Rahaga to find a way to revert to their original forms while remaining committed to their primary objective of rescuing the Matoran.\n\nThe film opens with the sight of Makuta, the Master of Shadows, still frozen in his crystal prison following the events of \"Legends of Metru Nui\". A mysterious figure calls out his name, then scratches the prison and extracts a shard from it. This figure is later revealed to be Roodaka, the queen of the Visorak horde, and she is later shown infusing the shard into her chest as she vows to free Makuta from his prison.\n\nVakama, as a Turaga, continues the story of the Toa Metru. Having combined their elemental powers to seal the Makuta in protodermis at the end of the previous film, the Toa left Metru Nui to find a home for the sleeping Matoran, vowing to return to the city to rescue the ones they had to leave behind. However, in their absence, the city became overrun by the 'stealers of life', the Visorak horde.\n\nThe Toa Metru (Vakama, Nokama, Matau, Onewa, Whenua, and Nuju) arrive on the shore of Metru Nui and proceed towards the Coliseum where the Matoran are being held, observing the damage that has been dealt to the city. They are soon ambushed by a group of Visorak and taken to the Coliseum, where they are infused with the Visorak's venom and mutated into beast-like creatures. Having been ordered killed by Sidorak, king of the Visorak horde, the Toa are sent falling to their deaths. They are saved by six flying beings who later introduce themselves as Rahaga, led by Norik.\n\nNorik explains that the Visorak venom has transformed the Toa into Hordika, making them more susceptible to their bestial natures. As they will remain Hordika forever if the venom is not neutralized in time, their only hope of changing back lies in an ancient hermit-like Rahi named Keetongu, who is considered by some to be a myth. Vakama grows angry over being blamed for the Toa's current situation and storms off, choosing to try and save the Matoran alone. However, he is cornered by Visorak and taken to the Coliseum once again. Roodaka takes advantage of Vakama's current state of mind by giving him a proposal: if he commands the Visorak horde, he can rule Metru Nui. Overpowered by his Hordika instinct, Vakama accepts her offer.\n\nThe other Toa, along with the Rahaga, go to the Great Temple to search for clues to Keetongu's whereabouts. Vakama ambushes the Rahaga during the night, capturing five of them and leaving Norik behind. He takes them to Sidorak, who allows Vakama to act as the general of the Visorak horde. Norik later informs the Toa of what Vakama has done, reiterating that they must find Keetongu before the Toa are completely consumed by their bestial states as Vakama has apparently been. Using inscriptions translated before the attack, the group follows a trail that leads them to Keetongu's lair at the top of the Ko-Metru district. Though reluctant at first, Keetongu eventually agrees to aid them.\n\nThe Toa return to the Coliseum and engage the Visorak. Matau confronts Vakama alone, while Keetongu goes after the king and queen. Roodaka orchestrates the death of Sidorak by leaving him to be killed by Keetongu. Matau tries to reason with Vakama as they fight each other; he apologizes for previously doubting Vakama's leadership and reminds Vakama of his duty as a Toa and his destiny to rescue the Matoran, eventually prompting Vakama to return to his senses.\n\nNorik frees his fellow Rahaga and joins the Toa, but Roodaka arrives and demands control over the Toa's elemental powers. Vakama and Matau rejoin the rest of the team, with Vakama feigning continued allegiance to Roodaka. After the other five Toa unsuccessfully attempt to defeat Roodaka by firing their elemental spinner weapons at her, Vakama reveals his change of heart and orders the Visorak to leave and be free; having been placed under his command, the horde obeys. Vakama then proceeds to fire his own spinner at Roodaka, incapacitating her and destroying her heartstone which she had previously carved from the Makuta's crystal prison. The stone's destruction causes Makuta's prison to break and free him, and Makuta then uses his powers to teleport Roodaka to safety. Fully aware that his actions have freed the Master of Shadows, Vakama is nevertheless confident that they can stop him again. After Keetongu returns the Hordika to their Toa Metru forms, the Toa bid farewell to him and the Rahaga and depart Metru Nui with the comatose Matoran.\n\nFollowing the events of \"Mask of Light\", Turaga Vakama concludes the story of the Toa Metru that he had been recounting to Takanuva, Jaller, and Hahli. As they leave, Vakama tells them that it is time for them to find their own destiny.\n\nDavid Molina and Terry Shakespeare worked as Art Directors on the film in addition to directing, and Terry also worked as Visual Effects Supervisor.\n\nNathan Furst, who composed the music for the first two films, returned once more to compose \"Web of Shadows\". His work on the film was praised by director David Molina who said that watching the movie with the music was an \"amazing experience\", making the story \"suddenly alive and emotional\". The soundtrack was released on December 22, 2017, twelve years after the film's release. It contains the complete score as it was written for the film and, like the other two soundtracks, is fully remastered.\n\nThe soundtrack includes Furst's original, unused sketch for Roodaka's theme as a bonus track. While the full theme is unused in the film itself in favor of a different motif associated with the character, hints of the sketch are present at various moments throughout the score and an alternate variation can be heard in the film's DVD menus.\n\nThe film's end credits feature the song \"Caught in a Dream\" by All Insane Kids, one of the two songs they had written for the 2005 storyline.\n\nThe film received mixed to positive reviews.\nThe computer-generated effects were praised by some critics, stating that they could be appreciated even though the film was geared toward teenagers and young people. The DVD release was noted for its good quality audio and video but meager extras.\n\nBionicle was nominated for the Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing in Direct to Video by the Motion Pictures Sound Editors, and the Annie Award for Best Home Entertainment Production.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2022813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022813", "title": "X Club", "text": "X Club\n\nThe X Club was a dining club of nine men who supported the theories of natural selection and academic liberalism in late 19th-century England. Thomas Henry Huxley was the initiator; he called the first meeting for 3 November 1864. The club met in London once a month—except in July, August and September—from November 1864 until March 1893, and its members are believed to have wielded much influence over scientific thought. The members of the club were George Busk, Edward Frankland, Thomas Archer Hirst, Joseph Dalton Hooker, Thomas Henry Huxley, John Lubbock, Herbert Spencer, William Spottiswoode, and John Tyndall, united by a \"devotion to science, pure and free, untrammelled by religious dogmas.\"\n\nThe nine men who would compose the X Club already knew each other well. By the 1860s, friendships had turned the group into a social network, and the men often dined and went on holidays together. After Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" was published in 1859, the men began working together to aid the cause for naturalism and natural history. They backed the liberal Anglican movement that emerged in the early 1860s, and both privately and publicly supported the leaders of the movement.\n\nAccording to its members, the club was originally started to keep friends from drifting apart, and to partake in scientific discussion free from theological influence. A key aim was to reform the Royal Society, with a view to making the practice of science professional. In the 1870s and 1880s, the members of the group became prominent in the scientific community and some accused the club of having too much power in shaping the scientific landscape of London. The club was terminated in 1893, after depletion by death, and as old age made regular meetings of the surviving members impossible.\n\nWhen the first dinner meeting commenced on 3 November 1864 at St. George's Hotel on Albemarle Street in central London, the eight members of what was to be known as the X Club—William Spottiswoode was added at the second meeting in December 1864—already had extensive social ties with one another. In the mid-1850s, the men who would come to make up the X Club formed two distinct sets of friends. John Tyndall, Edward Frankland and Thomas Hirst, men who became friends in the late 1840s, were artisans who became physical scientists. Thomas Huxley, Joseph Dalton Hooker, and George Busk, friends since the early 1850s, had worked as surgeons and had become professional naturalists. Beginning in the mid-1850s, the network began to form around Huxley and Hooker, and these six men began helping one another, both as friends and professionals. In 1863, for example, Tyndall aided Frankland in getting a position at the Royal Institution. Spottiswoode, Herbert Spencer, and John Lubbock joined the circle of friends during the debates over evolution and naturalism in the early 1860s.\n\nThe original members of the club had much in common. They shared a middle-class background and similar theological beliefs. All of the men were middle-aged, except Lubbock, who was 30, and Busk, who was 57, and all of the men, except Lubbock, lived in London. More importantly, the men of the club all shared an interest in natural history, naturalism, and a more general pursuit of intellectual thought free from religious influence, commonly referred to as academic liberalism.\n\nThe X Club came together during a period of turbulent conflict in both science and religion in Victorian England. The publication in 1859 of Charles Darwin's book \"On the Origin of Species through Natural Selection\" brought a storm of argument, with the scientific establishment of wealthy amateurs and clerical naturalists as well as the Church of England attacking this new development. Since the start of the 19th century they had seen evolutionism as an assault on the divinely ordained aristocratic social order. On the other side, Darwin's ideas on evolution were welcomed by liberal theologians and by a new generation of salaried professional scientists; the men who would later come to form the X Club supported Darwin, and saw his work as a great stride in the struggle for freedom from clerical interference in science. The members of the X social network played a significant part in nominating Darwin for the Copley Medal in 1864.\n\nIn 1860, \"Essays and Reviews\", a collection of essays on Christianity written by a group of liberal Anglicans, was published. The collection represented a summation of a nearly century-long challenge to the history and prehistory of the Bible by higher critics as well as geologists and biologists. In short, the writers of \"Essays and Reviews\" sought to analyse the Bible like any other work of literature. At the time, \"Essays\" created more of a stir than Darwin's book. The members of the X network backed the collection, and Lubbock even sought to form an alliance between liberal Anglicans and scientists. Two liberal Anglican theologians were convicted of heresy, and when the government overturned the judgement on appeal, Samuel Wilberforce, the High Church and the evangelicals organised petitions and a mass backlash against evolution. At the Anglican convocation, the evangelicals presented a declaration reaffirming their faith in the harmony of God's word and his works and tried to make this a compulsory \"Fortieth Article\" of faith. They took their campaign to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, aiming to overthrow Huxley's \"dangerous clique\" of Darwin's allies.\n\nIn 1862, Bishop John William Colenso of Natal published \"The Pentateuch and Book of Joshua Critically Examined\", an analysis of the first five books of the Old Testament. In his analysis Colenso used mathematics and concepts of population dynamics, including examinations of food supply and transportation, to show that the first five books of the Bible were faulty and unreliable. Outrage broke out within the Church of England, and the X network not only gave their support to Colenso, but at times even dined with him to discuss his ideas.\nLater, in 1863, a new rift began to emerge within the scientific community over race theory. Debate was stirred up when the Anthropological Society of London, which rejected Darwinian theory, claimed that slavery was defensible based on the theory of evolution proposed by Darwin. The members of what would become the X Club sided with the Ethnological Society of London, which denounced slavery and embraced academic liberalism. The men of the X Club, especially Lubbock, Huxley, and Busk, felt that dissension and the \"jealousies of theological sects\" within learned societies were damaging, and they attempted to limit the contributions the Anthropological Society made to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, a society of which they were all members.\n\nThus, by 1864, the members of the X Club were joined in a fight, both public and private, to unite the London scientific community with the objective of furthering the ideas of academic liberalism.\n\nDining clubs, common in late-Victorian England, were characterised by informal gatherings where men with similar interests could share new ideas and information among friends. Many formal societies and institutions that existed in England during the 19th century started as informal dining clubs. The problem with most formal societies at the time, especially to those men that would come together to form the X Club, was the manner in which meetings were conducted; most were too large and unsuitable for the discussion of private scientific matters. In addition, due to the outbreak of debates over evolution and religion within the scientific societies of London during the 1860s, the pursuit of discussion with likeminded men was often difficult.\n\nSeveral scientific clubs, such as the Philosophical Club and the Red Lion Club, were formed in the late 19th century, but these organisations lacked the scientific professionalism that serious scientists, including those members of the X Club such as Hooker and Huxley, sought. Other more serious clubs, such as the 'B-Club', were not sufficiently intimate for the men who would comprise the X Club.\n\nIn 1864, Huxley wrote to Hooker and explained that he feared he and his group of friends, the other men of the social network, would drift apart and lose contact. He proposed the creation of a club that would serve to maintain social ties among the members of the network, and Hooker readily agreed. Huxley always insisted that sociability was the only purpose of the club, but others in the club, most notably Hirst, claimed that the founding members had other intentions. In his description of the first meeting, Hirst wrote that what brought the men together was actually a \"devotion to science, pure and free, untrammelled by religious dogmas,\" and he predicted that situations would arise when their concerted efforts would be of great use.\n\nOn the night of the first meeting, Huxley jokingly proposed that the club be named \"Blastodermic Club\", in reference to blastoderm, a layer of cells in the ovum of birds that acts as the center of development for the entire bird. Some historians, such as Ruth Barton, feel that Huxley wanted the newly formed club to act as a guide to the development of science. The name \"Thorough Club\", which referred to the movements that existed at the time for the \"freedom to express unorthodox opinion\", was also rejected as a possible name. As Spencer would later explain, \"X Club\" was chosen in May 1865 because \"it committed [the group] to nothing.\" The name itself, according to Hirst, was proposed by Mrs. Busk.\n\nIt was also decided on the first night that each ensuing meeting would take place on the first Thursday of each month, except during the holiday months of July, August, and September. During the existence of the club, dinners took place at St. George’s Hotel on Albemarle Street, Almond’s Hotel on Clifford Street, and finally at the Athenaeum Club after 1886. Meetings always started at six in the evening so that dinner would be over in time for the Royal Society meetings at 8:00 or 8:30 pm in the Burlington House.\nEight men attended the first meeting, and in addition Spottiswoode came to the next meeting in December 1864, making the membership of nine. William Benjamin Carpenter, an English physiologist, and William Fergusson, the Queen's surgeon, were also invited to join the club, but they declined. After some discussion, it was decided, according to Spencer, that no more members would be added because no other men outside their network were friendly or intelligent enough to be part of the X Club. In contrast, Huxley would later write that no others were admitted to the group because it was agreed that the name of any new member would have to contain \"all the consonants absent from the names of the old ones.\" As the members of the club had no Slavonic friends, the matter was supposedly dropped.\n\nAccording to Spencer, the only rule the club had was to have no rules. When a resolution was proposed in November 1885 to keep formal notes of the meetings, the motion was defeated because it violated the rule. Nevertheless, the club kept both a secretary and a treasurer, and both positions were held in turn by each member of the club. These offices were in charge of account collecting and sending notices of upcoming meetings. Members, including Hirst, Huxley, Hooker, and Tyndall, also took informal notes of the meetings.\n\nBetween the time of its inception in 1864 and its termination in 1893, the X club and its members gained much prominence within the scientific community, carrying much influence over scientific thought, similar to the Scientific Lazzaroni in the United States and the Society of Arcueil in France. Between 1870 and 1878, Hooker, Spottiswoode, and Huxley held office in the Royal Society simultaneously, and between 1873 and 1885, they consecutively held the presidency of the Royal Society. Spottiswoode was treasurer of the Society between 1870 and 1878 and Huxley was elected Senior Secretary in 1872. Frankland and Hirst were also of importance to the Society, as the previous held the position of Foreign Secretary between 1895 and 1899, and the latter served on the Council three times between 1864 and 1882.\n\nOutside the Royal Society, the men of the X Club continued to gain influential positions. Five members of the Club held the presidency of the British Association for the Advancement of Science between 1868 and 1881. Hirst was elected president of the London Mathematical Society between 1872 and 1874 while Busk served as Examiner and eventually President of the Royal College of Surgeons. Frankland also served as President of the Chemical Society between 1871 and 1873.\n\nDuring this time, the members of the X-Club began to gain renown and win awards within the scientific community in London. Among the nine, three received the Copley Medal, five received the Royal Medal, two received Darwin Medals, one received the Rumford Medal, one received the Lyell Medal, and one received the Wollaston Medal. Eighteen honorary degrees were handed out among the nine members, as well as one Prussian 'Pour le Mérite' and one Order of Merit. Two of the members were knighted, one served as Privy Councillor, one as Justice of the Peace, three as Corresponding Members, and one was a Foreign Associate of the French Academy of Sciences.\n\nAs the members of the club continued to gain prominence within the scientific community, the private club became well known. Many people at the time viewed the club as a scientific caucus, and some, such as Richard Owen, accused the group of having too much influence in shaping the scientific landscape of late-Victorian England. Huxley recounted that he once overheard a conversation about the club between two men of the Athenaeum Club, and when one asked what the X-Club did, the other explained \"Well they govern scientific affairs, and really, on the whole, they don't do it badly.\" Informal notes of early meetings seem to confirm some of the concerns. Discussion often surrounded the nomination of members to offices of major societies, as well as the negotiation of pension and medal claims. In 1876, the club even voted to collectively support Lubbock’s candidacy for the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\nHuxley, however, always stated that the simple purpose of the club was to bring friends together who may have drifted apart otherwise. According to Huxley, the fact that all the members of the club gained distinction within science was merely coincidental.\n\nBy 1880, the members of the X Club had prominent positions within the scientific community, and the club was highly regarded, but it was beginning to fall apart. In 1883, Spottiswoode died of typhoid and at the same time, according to Spencer, only two of the remaining eight members of the X club were in good health. Attendance at meetings began to dwindle and by 1885, Frankland and Lubbock urged for the election of new members. There was a difference of opinion on the matter and it was eventually dropped. In 1889, a rift emerged in the group when Huxley and Spencer had an argument over land nationalisation policies and refused to talk with one another.\n\nThe members of the club were growing old and during the late 1880s and early 1890s, a few of the members moved out of London. When attendance began to severely dwindle, talks of ending the club emerged. The last meeting was held unceremoniously in March 1893, and only Frankland and Hooker attended.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2022817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022817", "title": "Party admission", "text": "Party admission\n\nThe party admission, in the law of evidence, is a type of statement that appears to be hearsay (an out of court statement) but is generally exempted (excluded) from the definition of hearsay because it was made by a party to the litigation adverse to the party introducing it into evidence.\n\nIn the USA, a party admission, in the law of evidence, is any statement made by a declarant who is a party to a lawsuit, which is offered as evidence \"against\" that party. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, such a statement is admissible to prove the truth of the statement itself, meaning that the statement itself is not considered hearsay at all. This is a category of exemptions to the inadmissibility of out-of-court statements. When the term \"exemption\" is used here, it does not mean that the statement is an \"exception\" to the hearsay rule. Rather, a party admission is classified as \"nonhearsay\" by the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nThe statement is admissible even if the declarant had no basis for knowing the truth of the statement. For example, if an employee rushes to tell the manager of a trucking company that one of his trucks has been in an accident, and the manager says, \"oh, we're behaving so negligently, lately,\" that statement will be admissible - even though the manager had no reason to know that this particular accident was the result of negligence.\n\nThe exemption permits one party to offer the out-of-court statement of any opponent party. It may not be used by a party to offer that party's own out-of-court statement. However, under the common-law doctrine of completeness, a party may possibly be able to admit some statements of their own, if a party admission exemption allows the opponent to admit part of a statement, and the first party wishes to admit the rest of that statement.\n\nThe rationale for a party admission exception to hearsay exclusion can be mostly easily understood by reference to the rationale for the hearsay rule itself. Affidavit evidence consisting of out-of-court statements, is not subject to cross-examination. Affidavit evidence is thought to detract from the truth-finding mission of a trial. The accuracy or credibility of affidavits lack the transparency that cross-examination exacts, but—at least in civil cases—a party may be cross-examined or give an explanation or denial of its admission. In criminal cases, however, \"modern psychological interrogation techniques can cause innocent suspects\" to falsely admit to crimes. Therefore, depending on the context, party admissions may advance, rather than detract from, the truth-finding mission.\n\nThere is frequent confusion about whether a \"party admission\" has to be a statement that is against the interests of its maker. The word \"admission\" connotes that the statement must be harmful. However, the party admission exemption does not in any way require that the admission be a representation against the party's interest - a \"statement against interest.\"\n\n\"Statements against interest\" made by other witnesses are sometimes admissible over the hearsay exception, but that is covered by a different exception. The \"statements against interest\" rule is different because:\n\n\nThe reach of Rule 801(d)(2) extends beyond simple statements of a party's own making, which is exempted under 801(d)(2)(A). It also applies to statements made by others, if the party manifests belief and approval. Further, it applies to vicarious admissions - those made by a declarant authorized by the party to make the statement, or by a servant or agent, if it concerns a matter within the scope of the servant. Finally, it allows admission of any statement made by a co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy, provided there is independent evidence of the conspiracy's existence.\n\nWith regard to adoptive admissions, even a party's silence can be a basis for admitting evidence under this exemption. In some jurisdictions, the court is required to let the jury consider whether the silence was an adoptive admission.\n\nThe rule creates an issue in criminal prosecutions of multiple defendants. The use of a party admission of one defendant is not generally allowed to be considered against the second, unless they are co-conspirators.\n\nThe Party Admission rule is nearly universal in the U.S. Many states follow the Federal Rules of Evidence, but some do not. Those states do not draw a distinction between \"exemptions\" and \"exceptions.\" However, the party admission is still admissible under all of the same circumstances as in rule 801(d).\n"}
{"id": "2022818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022818", "title": "Crossmolina", "text": "Crossmolina\n\nCrossmolina is a town in the Barony of Tyrawley in County Mayo, Ireland, as well as the name of the parish in which Crossmolina is situated. The town sits on the River Deel near the northern shore of Lough Conn. Crossmolina is about 9 km west of Ballina on the N59 Road.\n\nThe name Crossmolina translates into Crois Uí Mhaoilíona, meaning \"Cross of Mullany\". In the 18th century, the name was sometimes spelt as either Crossmalina, Crossmaliney, Crosmolyna or Crossmaling.\n\nThe origins of present-day Crossmolina are tied to the founding of a religious settlement in the area: Errew Abbey was founded by St. Tiernan in the 6th century. In the 12th Century this Abbey came into possession of the invading Hiberno-Norman de Barry family. During the 15th century, Crossmolina passed into the hands of the Bourke Family. In 1526 O'Donnell of Tir Conaill (Co. Donegal) invaded Tirawley and destroyed Crossmolina Castle. In response, the Bourkes constructed a replacement in Deel Castle. Their possession of this new fortress did not last however as during the Williamite War in Ireland of the 1690s Thomas Burke fought for the defeated Catholic Jacobites. Subsequently, Deel Castle was granted by the English crown to the Anglo-Irish Protestant Gore family, ushering in the era of Protestant Ascendancy into the area.\n\nIn 1798 Crossmolina was swept up with the events of the United Irishmen Rebellion when French Forces under General Humbert came from Ballina, passed by Crossmolina, towards Lahardane and on towards Castlebar as they went west of Lough Conn to fight the Battle of Castlebar.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the town became a local commercial center. Regular fairs were held in May, September and December. The town is referenced in the Leigh's pocket road book of Ireland, published in 1827, as a \"village in Mayo\", whose \"most remarkable object is the ruin of an Abbey dedicated to the Virgin Mary\". Crossmolina was also mentioned in Samuel Lewis' \"Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837). The population of the town at that time was estimated to be 1,431, who lived in 310 houses. The town contained \"one good street and two converging ones\" Lewis also enumerated the main local landlords:'There are several gentlemen's seats in the vicinity: the principal are Eniscoe, the residence of M. Pratt, Esq.; Gurtner Abbey, of G. Ormsby, Esq.; Abbeytown, of W. Orme, Esq.; Knockglass, of T. Paget, Esq.; Fortland, of Major Jackson; Glenmore, of W. Orme, Esq.; Greenwood Park, of Capt. J. Knox; Belleville, of W. Orme, Esq.; Millbrook, of W. Orme, sen., Esq; Netley Park, of H. Knox, Esq.; Castle Hill, of Major McCormick; Ballycorroon, of E. Orme, Esq.; Stone Hall, of T. Knox, Esq.; Fahy, of Ernest A. Knox, Esq.; Cottage, of W. Ormsby, Esq.; Rappa Castle, of Annesley Gore Knox, Esq. (See Kilfyan); and the Vicarage-house, the residence of the Rev. — St. George, rector. Deel castle, on the banks of the river of the same name, now a fine modern residence, surrounded with much old timber, stands on the site of a very ancient structure.\"\n\nThe structure of land ownership in North Mayo was a constant source of tension throughout the 19th century. Large landowners, who often resided in England, rented land out to tenant farmers, whose tenure on the land was often precarious. This led to significant resistance from the local population when rents were adjusted, leading to periodic eruptions of violence. Moreover, the rural areas surrounding the town suffered from endemic poverty. The Royal Commission into the Condition of the Poorer Classes in Ireland, published in 1838, provided some data on the living conditions of the rural poor living near Crossmolina. The diet of the poor was almost entirely potatoes, while the consumption of meat was very rare (estimated to be only once or twice a year). Laborers could expect a daily payment of between 6 and 8 pennies per day, with some element of wages being paid in the form of food.\n\nDuring the first decade of the century, local peasants formed a secret society called \"The Threshers\". The group was responsible for a number of \"outrages\" including destroying crops and breaking into houses. The group wore a uniform of white shirts. In 1806 a local man – Thady Lavin – had informed the local magistrate of the activities of the group. He was later found murdered near Crossmolina. Six local men - Coll Flynn, Laurence Flynn, Charles Flynn, Thomas Horan, Daniel Regan, and Daniel Callaghan - were convicted of his murder, and hanged in Castlebar in December 1806. \n\nIn December 1813, violence again broke out when a crowd of local residents, armed with pikes and guns, tried to take back cattle that had been sequestered to pay for outstanding rent arrears.\n\nBetween 1820-1840, the agrarian movement - the \"Ribbonmen\" - were active in Crossmolina. In December 1821, four local men, John Carr, Peter Gillaspy, Eneas Early, and Mathew Chambers, were sent to prison for membership of the Ribbonmen and for administering illegal oaths. The local magistrate, George Ormsby, Esq. of Gortner Abbey, was responsible for sending the men to prison. Owing to the high degree of rural unrest, in 1820 a detachment of the yeomanry consisting of three officers and 85 men were on permanent duty in the town. In February 1839, the Crossmolina Parish Priest - Fr John Barrett - was murdered at Enniscoe Gate, about a mile and a half from Crossmolina. He was attacked late at night while returning from the town to his residence. It was widely speculated at the time that he was murdered because he denounced at the pulpit the activities of a secret society called the \"Steel Boys\". In 1842, a local Crossmolina Man - John Walsh - was convicted of being a member of the Ribbonmen and transported for seven years. He was found to be in possession of secret passwords and documents relating to the secret society.\n\nRural violence and political unrest continued through to the second half of the 19th century. In March 1881, the Crossmolina home of the high constable of Tryrawley was attacked by a group of armed men. In November 1882, the local Parish Priest was arrested for permitting a Land League meeting in the Crossmolina Chapel. In June 1882, a Crossmolina farmer called Michael Brown was shot and severely wounded. He had taken over a farm that had been boycotted by local residents.\n\nThe town was badly damaged during the \"Night of the Big Wind\" (Irish: \"Oíche na Gaoithe Móire\") that swept across Ireland on 6 January 1839. Almost every house in the town was damaged with four houses destroyed completely. Eight residents were killed.\n\nDuring the first half of the nineteenth century, failures of the potato crop were a regular occurrence leading to periodic famines in Ireland. In 1820, the Archbishop of Tuam had reported widespread starvation throughout Mayo. In 1822, Richard Sharpe – an agent for the Palmer estate who owned large amounts of land around Crossmolina – had organized shipments of oats to relieve starvation around the town. In May 1831, Sharpe organized another collection among local landlords to purchase a shipment of oats to feed the starving tenants. In June 1831, the town suffered an outbreak of Typhus and Dysentery. Dr. James McNair reported to the Connaught Telegraph that he had identified over 100 cases of Typhus, of which 38 patients lived within Crossmolina. In December 1813, a large crowd of local residents, armed with pikes and guns, gathered to rescue cattle that had been sequestered to pay outstanding rents.\n\nThe town fared reasonably well during The Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s. The town residents could rely on their commercial activities to sustain themselves during the crisis. However, the famine devastated the rural areas surrounding Crossmolina, slicing the population from 12,221 in 1841 to 7,236 by 1851. The Famine also had drastic effects on the use of language in the area: It is estimated that over 80% of the Crossmolina area spoke the Irish Language previous to the famine.\n\nDue to the work of the local coroner and doctor (Mr. Atkinson and Dr. McNair) the names of some of the famine victims were recorded in the local press. The victims often moved from their homes in the countryside to beg in the town.\n\n\nLike much of Mayo, the Land League was active in the town and the surrounding area. in October 1881, the Rev. McHale - Parish Priest of Adergoole was arrested under the Coercion Act for holding a Land League meeting in the Roman Catholic Chapel. A month later, Peter Doherty, a member of the Crossmolina branch of the league was also arrested.\n\nIn the 1880s, Pat Nally was arrested, tried and convicted of \"The Crossmolina Conspiracy\", a supposed Fenian plot to murder landlords' agents in the Crossmolina area.\n\nOn Sunday, 28 August 1910, a riot broke out in Crossmolina when the leader of the All for Ireland League (AFIL) - William O'Brien MP - tried to hold an open-air meeting in the town centre. The league was a non-sectarian nationalist political party that briefly flourished prior to the first world war. Its main objective was to form a broad coalition between the Unionist and Nationalist populations. The league was opposed by more Catholic nationalist organisations such as the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) and the United Irish League.\n\nO'Brien had scheduled a meeting in the town, and fearing a conflict with the local population, he was accompanied by large contingent of police as well as a large number of AFIL supporters. When he entered the town, he was confronted by a large group of locals armed with sticks and rocks. O'Brien planned to speak at an open-air meeting at the corner of Chapel Street. To get him to chapel street, the police baton-charged the crowd, eventually succeeding in pushing the locals back and allowing O'Brien to speak. However, the Lahardane Fife and Drum band began to play while the locals started shouting preventing O'Brien from being heard. Further violence broke out and a revolver was fired as AFIL retreated from the town towards Ballina. O'Brien was struck on the head by a stick by one of the rioters. A month later, Thomas Moclair was found guilty of discharging a firearm at the Crossmolina Petty Sessions. He was fined 10s and forced to pay court costs. The event received widespread media coverage throughout the United Kingdom.\n\nIn July 1920, four Sinn Féin activists - who were all brothers from the Hegarty family of Castlehill, Crossmolina - were arrested and escorted to Castlebar under a heavy military escort.\n\nAn RIC policeman – Constable William Kelly – was tried by court-martial for attempted murder of a civilian in Crossmolina. On 20 December 1920 Constable Kelly was drunk when he confronted a local man and opened fire with his rifle. When he was arrested, he admitted to firing \"at a bloody Sinn Feiner.\" He was found not guilty of attempted murder, but guilty of shooting with intent to do grievous bodily harm.\n\nIn October 1920, John O'Reilly – a resident of Crossmolina – faced a courtmartial in Galway. He was accused of possessing a revolver and threatening local R.I.C. officers. He warned the officers to resign from the police force. He also threatened to burn down the local R.I.C. barracks. Subsequently, a number of officers posted to Crossmolina resigned from the force.\n\nIn Spring 1922, a company of the IRA based in Crossmolina was responsible for attacking and burning the R.I.C. Station in Bellacorick.\n\nIn February 1922, the IRA declared \"martial law\" in Crossmolina. The Irish Transport and General Workers Union organized a strike in Davis Bros after an Apprentice was fired. During the strike, a warehouse owned by Davis was burnt, destroying a large number of eggs awaiting shipment. A large number of cattle were maimed, belonging to a farmer who condemned the attack on Davis Bros. Ten local men were arrested in connection with attacks on property.\n\nIn September 1922, Malachai Gerety (26) was shot and killed in the crossfire between Republicans and the Free State Army. Gerety, a cattle dealer from Ballygar, was returning from the Crossmolina fair when he accidentally drove into a firefight in Ballina. Earlier in the month, Mossbrook House - a large mansion just outside Crossmolina - was burnt by Republicans. Shortly afterwards, the National Army arrested \"Brig-General\" Patrick Hegarty, who was the leader of the Republicans in Crossmolina.\n\nIn October 1922, Republicans attacked the National Army Barracks in Crossmolina. After a five-hour gun battle, the Republicans were forced out of the town. In January 1923, the Barracks was again attacked by a sniper. There were no reported casualties but several private houses in the town were pierced by bullets.\n\nOn 5 January 1923, Patrick Mahon, a native of Crossmolina, was shot dead by a National Army patrol in Ballina. The patrol heard shouts of \"Up Kilroy,\" and \"Up the Bolshies\". The soldiers went to investigate and apprehended Mahon, who resisted arrest. On being brought to the barracks a National Army soldier pushed Mahon in the back with his rifle and a shot went off. killing Mahon instantly. An inquest later recorded a verdict of accidental death.\n\nTwo irregulars - Nicholas Corcoran and Thomas Gill - were captured by the National Army in March 1923 in Massbrook, near Crossmolina. Corcoran was discovered with a revolver, ammunition, and explosives. A few days later, Jack Leonard was arrested in his home in Crossmolina. Leonard was the photographer who took one of the most iconic images of the War of Independence - \"the Men of the West\". It is the photo of the West Mayo IRA Flying Column, taken at Derrymartin on the slopes of Nephin mountain, in June 1921. It is widely regarded as the best contemporary photograph of an IRA Active Service Unit ever taken.\n\nOn 13 March 1942, a Bristol Type 149 Blenheim IV crashed in Killeen, Crossmolina. The plane was on a training flight from Isle of Man. The wireless failed, the crew lost their bearings and eventually, the plane ran low on fuel. The crew made an emergency landing, but overshot the chosen landing spot and went through hedges and boulders. Two crew members were seriously injured. Two of the less seriously injured crew were repatriated to Northern Ireland the following day. The two more seriously injured crew were repatriated by ambulance a week later.\n\nOn 25 October 1942, an RAF plane on route from Newfoundland attempted an emergency landing in Pulladoohy, near Crossmolina. However. the plane landed upside down, killing the pilot. The plane a Boston Douglas light bomber with a crew of 3 came in to land in what seemed to be a flat green field, but unfortunately, the landing site was bog. The pilot, Captain Nils Rasmussen a Norwegian was buried with military honours in Kilmurray Cemetery. The surviving crew of the aircraft were taken in hand by local members of the Local Defence Force (LDF) and later by the Irish Army. The two survivors were Sgt Peter Frank Craske (1387671) Royal Air Force and F/Sgt Frederick Michael Fuller (R/92107), Royal Canadian Air Force. The two airmen were sent across the border to Northern Ireland shortly after the crash.\n\nIn the Census of April 2011, Crossmolina had a population of 1,060 consisting of 535 males and 526 females. The population of pre-school age (0-4) was 62, of primary school going age (5-12) was 88 and of secondary school going age (13-18) was 76. There were 198 persons aged 65 years and over. The number of persons aged 18 years or over was 844.\n\nThe local Gaelic football is Crossmolina Deel Rovers. Founded in 1887 as Crossmolina Dr. Crokes, they became Deel Rovers in 1906. The club saw major success in the early 2000s, winning the Connacht Senior Club Football Championship in 1999, 2000 and 2002, and as well as obtaining the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship in 2001, and were runners-up for that title in 2003.\nCrossmolina AFC is the town's resident football club and were founded in 1992. The club plays in the Mayo Football League system and has seen moderate success, most notably winning the Tim Hastings League 1 title in 2015.\n\nSt Mary's Church - Built in 1818–19 is a fine example of an early 19th century Chapel constructed by the Church of Ireland. It was erected with the financial support of the Board of First Fruits. The interior of the church has a wall monument commemorating 'General Sir James Jackson C.C.B. K.H. who \"served with distinction through the Peninsular War at Waterloo and India\".\n\nCrossmolina Castle - Located across the road from St Mary's Church at the end of Church Street. In 1526 the castle was destroyed by O'Donnell, Chief of Tirconnell.\n\nGortnor Abbey - A large house, built by the Ormsby family in 1780. In 1916 it was converted into a convent boarding school run by the Jesus and Mary Order of nuns.\n\nErrew Abbey - A ruined 13th-century Augustinian church that sits on a tiny peninsula on the banks of Lough Conn. The abbey was reduced to ruins by Cromwellian settlers.\n\nMethodist Meeting House - Located on Church Street, there is the ruins of a Methodist meeting house. It was built in 1854, replacing an earlier meeting house established in 1835. The building was abandoned towards the end of the 19th century.\n\nEnniscoe House - A country house, built between 1790–1798, sometimes described as “the last Great House of North Mayo”. It now serves as a hotel.\n\nCrossmolina is the subject of \"Rake Street\", a poem by Harry Clifton.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2022825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022825", "title": "Mieszko IV Tanglefoot", "text": "Mieszko IV Tanglefoot\n\nMieszko IV Tanglefoot () (ca. 1130 – 16 May 1211) was Duke of Kraków and High Duke of Poland from 9 June 1210 until his death one year later. He was also Duke of Silesia from 1163 to 1173 (with his brother as co-ruler), Duke of Racibórz from 1173, and Duke of Opole from 1202.\n\nHis nickname \"Tanglefoot\" (Plątonogi) appeared in the chronicles from the 14th and 15th centuries. From \"Rocznik Sędziwoja\", annals written in the mid-fifteenth century, the entry for the year 1192: \"\"Cracovia civitas devastata est a Mescone loripede dicto Platonogy nepote ducis Kazimiriensis filio Wladislai exulis\"\" (en: \"The city of Kraków was devastated by Mieszko the bandy-legged, called Platonogy, nephew of Duke Casimir, son of Władysław the Exile\"). \n\nMieszko was the second son of Władysław II the Exile and Agnes of Babenberg. From 1146, after the deposition of his father, Mieszko and his family mainly lived in the town of Altenburg in Saxony, which was granted as a temporary possession to Władysław II by Agnes's half-brother King Conrad III of Germany. During his time in exile, Mieszko studied in Michaelsberg and Bamberg.\n\nThe exile for the deposed high duke turned out to be permanent; he died in Altenburg in 1159. His sons continued the fight to recover their inheritance, and finally three years later, in 1163, and thanks to the intervention of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, Mieszko and his older brother Bolesław I the Tall returned to Silesia.\n\nMieszko and Bolesław I the Tall co-ruled the Duchy of Wrocław during the period 1163–1173. At first, their rule did not extend over the major Silesian cities, which remained under the control of Bolesław IV the Curly, then the high duke of Poland. The brothers retook them in the year 1165, taking advantage of Bolesław IV's involvement in a crusade against the Prussians.\n\nEventually, Mieszko began efforts to obtain his own Duchy, in part because his older brother Bolesław took all the government into his hands and left little participation for Mieszko there. In 1172, Mieszko began an open rebellion against his brother. He also supported Bolesław's eldest son, Jarosław, who was forced to become a priest thanks to the intrigues of his stepmother Christina, who wished for her sons to be the only heirs. The rebellion was a complete surprise to Bolesław, who was forced to escape to Erfurt, Germany. However, the intervention of the Emperor favored the return of Bolesław soon afterwards, but he was forced to give separate lands to both Mieszko (who received the towns of Racibórz and Cieszyn) and Jarosław (who received Opole).\n\nIn 1177 Mieszko supported his uncle and namesake Mieszko III the Old when he had to fight to maintain his rule over the Duchy of Kraków. This renewed the disputes between him and Bolesław I the Tall, who wished to obtain the Duchy and with this the Seniorate. However, Bolesław suffered an unexpected defeat by Mieszko and his own son Jarosław, who distracted him from his advance over Kraków. In his place was his younger uncle and ally, Casimir II the Just, who captured the city and was proclaimed the new High Duke of Poland. Mieszko III the Old found himself in exile in Racibórz and it seemed that a war between Mieszko Tanglefoot and Casimir II the Just was now just a matter of time. Casimir II, however, went a different route, and in order to gain the favor of the Duke of Racibórz, gave him the towns of Oświęcim and Bytom (with the fortress of Oświęcim, Bytom, Mikołów, Siewierz and Pszczyna, although some historians estimate that these fortress had belonged to Mieszko only since 1179). On the other hand, Bolesław the Tall suffered a further diminution of his authority when he was compelled to give Głogów to his youngest brother Konrad, who had recently returned from Germany and claimed his part over the Silesian inheritance.\n\nIn 1195 Mieszko and his nephew Jarosław supported Mieszko III the Old in his new attempt to recover Kraków and the Seniorate. The death of Casimir II the Just and the minority of his sons gave them the opportunity to attack and regain control over Lesser Poland. However, Kraków and the nobility of Sandomierz, led by the voivode Nicholas, had other plans and decided to support Casimir II's eldest son, Leszek the White. Both sides clashed in the bloody Battle of Mozgawa (Mozgawą) near Jędrzejów (13 September 1195), where Mieszko III was seriously injured and his son Bolesław of Kuyavia died. The Silesian troops, led by Mieszko and Jarosław, arrived to the battlefield too late, soon after Mieszko III withdrew to Kalisz. Over the forces of the Count palatine , who also arrived to help Leszek's troops, the Silesians obtained a great victory; however, because Mieszko III was not present, this victory only brought them benefits in terms of prestige and the ransoms obtained from captured Sandomierz nobles.\n\nOn 22 March 1201 Jarosław of Opole died. The Duchy of Opole was then inherited by his father Bolesław the Tall, with whom the late duke had recently reconciled. However, Bolesław died only nine months later, on 7/8 December 1201, leaving all his lands to only surviving son, Henry the Bearded.\n\nMieszko was determined to obtain Opole and made a surprise attack at the beginning of 1202. The Duke managed to obtain Opole, which was from then on definitively joined to his lands. Despite this victory, Mieszko wanted additional territories, but this was against the wishes of the Church, which strongly supported Henry I the Bearded. Thanks to the intervention of Henryk Kietlicz, Archbishop of Gniezno, and Cyprian, Bishop of Wroclaw, Henry I maintained his frontiers, but he had to pay 1000 pieces of silver to his supporters.\n\nOn 9 June 1210, a papal bull was decreed by Pope Innocent III, under which all of the seniorate rulers (included High Duke Leszek the White) were deposed and excommunicated. The bull demanded that the Piast princes adhere to the testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth, which proposed that the most senior of the Piast dukes is the ruler in the seniorate. Strangely, in the bull an unnamed duke of Silesia (who was assumed to be Henry the Bearded, because he actually used that title) was exempted from the ban. The country was full of consternation, because nobody knew who had real power.\n\nArchbishop Henryk Ketlicz decided to call the , where he tried to find a solution to this delicate issue. At the convention, in addition to the hierarchy of the Church, Henry I the Bearded and the other junior dukes attended. Leszek the White, wanting to ensure the support of the Church, along with other Piast princes, then gave a great privilege, which ensured the integrity of territorial possession of the bishops (the privilege was not signed by Henry I and Władysław III Spindleshanks, but they did comply with the provisions established there). Mieszko, however, was not present in Borzykowa; with the support of the Gryfici family, he decided to lead his army and march into Kraków, where the confusion among the citizens left him in total control over the capital without fighting. This was the zenith of Mieszko's career, as he died less than one year later, on 16 May 1211. According to Jan Długosz, he was probably buried in the Cathedral of Kraków (Wawel Cathedral). Only after Mieszko's death could Leszek the White return to Kraków without major difficulties.\n\nBy 1178, Mieszko married Ludmila (died after 20 October 1210), whose origins are unknown. Her name indicates that she may have a Bohemian origin, probably a member of the Přemyslid dynasty. According to the majority of historians, she could be the daughter of , Duke of Olomouc, by his wife . There are also minority hypotheses that put her as a daughter of Duke Soběslav I of Bohemia; ; or , son of Otto III Detleb (who would be her brother according to the majority opinion). \n\nMieszko and Ludmila had five children:\n\n\n"}

In 1995, it was released again without the long box and picture booklet.\n\nBy the early 1990s, CDs were fast becoming the standard format for music. This provided a challenge for artists such as Donovan, whose entire catalog had been issued on vinyl. In order to rectify the situation, many record companies released CD boxed sets. These boxed sets allowed a more in depth overview than traditional greatest hits or best of compilations. Like greatest hits and best of collections, many of the boxed sets also included rare or previously unreleased recordings as a purchasing incentive for fans who may already have earlier albums.\n\nIn a mutually beneficial move for both record company and artist, Epic Records released \"Troubadour – The Definitive Collection 1964-1976\" in 1992. The two disc boxed set features almost all of Donovan's charting singles, many album tracks, and several rare and unreleased tracks. \"Troubadour – The Definitive Collection 1964-1976\" helped put Donovan back in the minds of his older fans, and helped acquaint more recent generations with his music.\n\nOn 25 November 2003, Australian record label Rajon Records (Rajon 50198) released the compilation under the title \"The Great Donovan\" spread out over three discs.

Stimson. He was an attorney, politician, and businessman in Nashville, Tennessee, where he also taught at Nashville University. He came to have a national role after moving to Chicago, Illinois, in 1899.\n\nJacob McGavock Dickinson was born on January 30, 1851 in Columbus, Mississippi. His father, Henry Dickinson, served as a Chancery Judge in Mississippi from 1843 to 1854. His mother was Anne McGavock. His maternal great-grandfather was Felix Grundy.\n\nDuring the American Civil War of 1861–1865, Dickinson enlisted at fourteen as a private in the Confederate States Army. Dickinson moved with his family to Nashville, Tennessee, where he graduated from the University of Nashville in 1871, and received his master's degree in 1872. While in college, he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He studied law briefly at Columbia Law School and continued his studies abroad in Leipzig and Paris. He spoke German. He was admitted to the Tennessee bar in 1874.\n\nDickinson built his law practice. From 1889 to 1893, Dickinson served as president of the Tennessee Bar Association. He served on the Tennessee Supreme Court from 1891 to 1893. He served as Assistant Attorney General of the United States from 1895 to 1897. From 1897 to 1899, he was a Professor of Law at the Vanderbilt University Law School and an attorney for the Louisville & Nashville Railroad.\n\nIn 1899 Dickinson moved to Chicago, Illinois. He became general solicitor for the Illinois Central Railroad, a position he held from 1899 to 1901. Dickinson later became general counsel for that railroad, a position he held from 1901 to 1909. He was a counsel for the Alaskan Boundary Tribunal in 1903, and was president of the American Bar Association from 1907 to 1908. Dickinson helped organize the American Society of International Law, served on its executive council from 1907 to 1910, and was its vice president in 1910.\n\nFrom March 12, 1909 to May 21, 1911, Dickinson served as United States Secretary of War. Despite being a Democrat, he was appointed as Secretary of War by Republican President William Howard Taft because the President wanted the South to be represented in his Cabinet. During Dickinson's tenure, he proposed legislation to permit the admission of foreign students to West Point, and recommended an annuity retirement system for civil service employees. He also suggested that Congress consider stopping the pay of soldiers rendered unfit for duty because of venereal disease or alcoholism as a means of combatting those problems.\n\nAfter his tenure as Secretary of War, Dickinson served as a special assistant attorney general and helped to prosecute U.S. Steel in 1913. He also acted in several important labor cases in 1922. He later was receiver of the Rock Island Lines from 1915 to 1917 and was president of the Izaak Walton League from 1927 until 1928.\n\nDickinson married Martha Overton in 1876. They resided at 1808–1810 Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D.C. He received the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nDickinson died in 1928 in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n"}
{"id": "2022858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022858", "title": "Norman W. Walker", "text": "Norman W. Walker\n\nNorman Wardhaugh Walker (4 January 1886, Italy – 6 June 1985, Cottonwood, Arizona ) was a British businessman and pioneer in the field of vegetable juicing and nutritional health. He advocated the drinking of fresh raw vegetable and fruit juices, both to regain and to maintain one's health. Based on his design, the Norwalk Hydraulic Press Juicer was developed. This juicer continues to be produced and sold today. Walker wrote several books on nutrition and healthy living.\n\nWalker was notable for at least three reasons: (1) He was the author of at least six books published from 1937 to 1978. (2) He was the inventor of an important and innovative commercial juicer that is still manufactured today. (3) He was a pioneer in the raw foods, juicing, and vegetarian movements, each of which has grown in size and scope over the years.\n\nAs of 2006, most book reviews and promotional web sites wrongly claim that Walker reached the phenomenal age of, variously, 109, 113, 116, 118 or even 119 years. Several official sources, the US Social Security Death Index and a grave marker all indicate that he actually lived to be 99 years of age.\n\nWalker was born in Genoa, Liguria, Italy on 4 January 1886 to Robert Walker, a Baptist minister from Scotland, and Lydia Maw Walker. He was the second of the six children of Rev. and Mrs. Walker that lived to adulthood. As a young man, he discovered the value of vegetable juices while recovering from a breakdown in a peasant house in the French countryside. Watching the woman in the kitchen peel carrots, he noticed the moistness on the underside of the peel. He decided to try grinding them and had his first cup of carrot juice.\n\nWalker followed his parents and siblings to the United States, leaving England in 1910 on the S.S. Lusitania, and arriving in New York City in October of that year, where Walker worked at various occupations (although he gave his occupation as \"painter\" in his immigration interview). Although Walker has never shown up in any publicly released Federal Censuses, he and wife Margaret were enumerated in both the interim New York State Censuses of 1915 and 1925, where his birthplace was stated as \"Italy\" and occupations given for him as \"janitor\" and \"real estate\", respectively.\n\nNorman W. Walker married Margaret Bruce Olcott, a New Yorker, on 11 June 1913 in New York City [New York State Marriage Index (on-line), Marriage Certificate No.13485]. Margaret Walker died in New York City in November 1970 (NY Times obituary and Social Security Death Index). It is not known when and where Norman and Margaret divorced, but the 18 January 1943 issue of the Reno (NV) Evening Gazette reported a Marriage Application for Norman W. Walker of San Francisco and Helen Ruth Kerby of Carson City. There is no indication Walker had children from either marriage.\n\nOn 22 November 1918, Walker was granted US citizenship by the New York State Court.\n\nOn 6 May 1933, The New York Times reported that \"An indeterminate penitentiary term of not more than three years was imposed by Judge Allen in General Sessions yesterday on Norman Walker, 47 years old...\" This was the fifth NY Times article in this matter, commencing in 1932.\nThe original charges involved advertisements placed in the New York Times by Walker, as managing director for The Broughton Institute of Ortho-Dietetics in NY City, wherein he allegedly promised employment with this school following completion of a six-weeks course. Neither employment nor requested return of the $150 tuition followed. According to a Probation Officer testifying at the Walker trial, 30 graduated students lost a total of $4,500 (approximately $80,000 in 2015 dollars per CPI calculation). It is currently unknown how much incarceration time, if any, Walker actually served.\n\nLater, Walker moved to Long Beach, California. With a medical doctor, he opened a juice bar and offered home delivery service. By 1930, they had devised dozens of fresh juice formulas for specific conditions. Walker believed colon cleansing with fresh juices was the key to good health. Walker designed his own juicer, the Norwalk, in two parts a grinder to slowly grind the vegetables and a press to extract the juice. When the San Francisco health department banned unpasteurised vegetable juices such as Walker's, he began manufacturing his juice machine in Anaheim, California. He kept the plant going in spite of the steel shortage during World War II.\n\nIn the late 1940s, he moved to St. George, Utah, where he found an old cotton mill, ideal for his juice plant, but he was again hampered by local health department regulations. He sold his share of the factory to his business partner and started publication of his own health magazine, \"The New Health Movement Review\". For several years, Walker ran a health ranch in Arizona. Eventually, he gave up the ranch to devote himself entirely to writing.\n\nWalker observed a raw food diet, with fresh raw juices, until his death. Although claims have been made that he was both physically and mentally healthy and active up to the day of his death when he peacefully died during his sleep one night at his home in Cottonwood, Yavapai County, Arizona, no \"official\" evidence\nof such claims, such as an Arizona death certificate, have, so far, ever publicly surfaced.\n\nHelmut Wandmaker (1916–2007), German Writer and Vegetarian, in his book (Willst du gesund sein? Vergiss den Kochtopf!) states that Dr. Walker lived to be 116 years old.\n\nWalker advocated a diet based solely on raw and fresh foods like vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds. He considered cooked or baked food dead and therefore unhealthful, saying that \"while such food can, and does, sustain life in the human system, it does so at the expense of progressively degenerating health, energy, and vitality.\" His attitude to frozen foods, however, was an accepting one, as at this temperature the live enzymes did not seem to be killed. As a vegan, he did not recommend eating meat, dairy products (with the exception of raw goat milk), fish or eggs. However, some of his recipes include egg yolks, unpasteurized cottage cheese and Swiss cheese, as well as raw cream. His diet suggestions avoided such staple foods as bread, pasta and rice, and sugar.\n\nWalker devoted large sections of many of his books to the description of the different organs of the human body, explaining how the digestive system and the various glands work. He considered a healthy colon the key to one's health. He estimated that 80% of all disease begins in the colon. He wrote: \"Every organ, gland and cell in the body is affected by the condition of the colon.\"\n\nAccording to Walker, the number one affliction underlying almost every ailment is constipation, stating that constipation is \"the primary cause of nearly every disturbance of the human system.\" This was, in his view, because the blood vessels lining the colon collect nutrients missed by the small intestine. In his book \"Pure and Simple Natural Weight Control\", Walker stated: \"If the feces in the colon have putrefied and fermented, any nutritional elements present in it would pass into the bloodstream as polluted products. What would otherwise be nutritional instead generates toxemia, a condition in which the blood contains poisonous products which are produced by the growth of pathogenic or disease-producing bacteria.\" Pimples can be an indication of the presence of toxaemia. Walker maintained that the Standard American Diet causes the colon to be filled with toxins that strain the eliminative channels and, ultimately, the immune system.\n\nWalker believed that dairy products especially had a deleterious effect on human health. He testified to the disappearance of many ailments upon the exclusion of dairy products. He explained that pathogenic organisms find an ideal breeding ground in the excess mucus that dairy products generate. He cited the following diseases as being aggravated or caused by mucus conditions in which dairy products are the major offender: undulant fever, colds, flu, bronchial troubles, tuberculosis, asthma, hay fever, sinus trouble, pneumonia and certain types of arthritis.\n\nHis writings reflect a wide interest in different aspects of health and nutrition; besides authoring eight books, he also produced three wall charts. Walker's work influenced later juice advocates such as Jason Vale in the UK, otherwise known as The Juice Master, and Jay Kordich, who popularised \"juicing\" in the United States with extensive television advertising in the 1990s.\n\nSeveral of Walker's books mention him having a DSc degree and the title page of his book \"Colon Health\" even mentions him as having a PhD as well. However, no mention is made as to where and when he actually earned or was awarded these academic titles.\n\n\n\n\n"}

During his career he was mainly associated with Betis and Valencia, appearing in over 500 La Liga matches over 17 seasons and scoring over 70 goals. In the competition he also represented Málaga, signing with Fiorentina from Italy in 2013.\n\nJoaquín was capped for Spain on 51 occasions, representing the nation in two World Cups and one European Championship.\n\nJoaquín was born in El Puerto de Santa María, Province of Cádiz. In 1999–2000 he started his senior career, appearing regularly for Real Betis B (after spending five years in the youth ranks) as it was eventually relegated from the third division; in the following season he moved to the first team, making his professional debut on 26 August 2000 and having an immediate impact – 38 matches and three goals – as the Andalusians returned to La Liga after one year out.\nSubsequently, Joaquín collected well over 200 official appearances for Betis in the following five years, assisting and scoring alike. During 2004–05 he played in all the games scoring five times, and added three goals in the campaign's Copa del Rey: in the latter, as the final was played at the Vicente Calderón Stadium on 11 June 2005, he played the full 90 minutes plus extra time as Betis won 2–1 against CA Osasuna.\n\nIn the following season's UEFA Champions League, Joaquín appeared in all six group stage games for Betis, including the 1–0 triumph over Chelsea and a 0–0 draw against Liverpool, at Anfield (third-place finish, UEFA Cup \"demotion\").\n\nIn late July 2006, following a conversation with Joaquín, Betis chairman José León stated that the player had convinced him that he would stay at the club for another year. \"It has surprised me a lot,” he admitted. “I came to convince him and on the contrary, he has convinced me\", he further added. In mid-August, the player caused shock at the club by declaring in a press conference his intentions to leave.\n\nJoaquín was meant to move to Valencia CF in early August 2006 for €18 million, in a swap deal that also included Mario Regueiro. However, some difficulties in the payment appeared, along with the Uruguayan's insistence in remaining at Valencia, with the transfer thus being delayed.\n\nJoaquín was loaned to Albacete Balompié as punishment by Betis owner Manuel Ruiz de Lopera, due to the player taking a certain percentage of the transfer fee. Lopera used a clause in his contract whereby he could be loaned to any club if it was decided by Betis (Joaquín travelled to his new club's facilities using his own transport and, to prove that he did so, had himself photographed by operatives working nearby. The switch was subsequently cancelled).\n\nJoaquín officially moved to Valencia in late August 2006 for €25 million, making him the club's most expensive signing to that date as the player penned a five-year contract, with the choice of a further one-year extension. In his first year, he played 35 matches and scored five goals as the \"Che\" made it to the Champions League's qualifying rounds.\n\nIn 2009–10, Joaquín began facing stiff competition for a starting berth, being challenged by younger Pablo Hernández; during the course of the campaign – Valencia also played in the UEFA Europa League – both players received roughly the same number of minutes, and scored a similar total of goals.\n\nWith the departure of David Villa to FC Barcelona, Joaquín was given the No. 7 shirt for 2010–11. He led the scoring charts after the first round, netting twice in a 3–1 win at Málaga CF. On 12 February 2011 he scored another brace, helping Valencia come from behind at Atlético Madrid to win it 2–1, eventually finishing third and qualify to the Champions League.\n\nOn 24 June 2011, Joaquín left Valencia and signed for Málaga for three years, for a fee of €4 million. He made his debut for the club on 28 August in a 1–2 away loss against Sevilla FC, and opened his scoring account by netting twice in another local derby, a 4–0 home win against Granada CF.\n\nIn two home games in October 2012 separated by only four days, Joaquín scored to give Málaga the final win, on both occasions after having missed a penalty: he started against Real Valladolid (2–1) then netted the match's only against A.C. Milan in the Champions League group stage.\n\nOn 13 June 2013, aged nearly 32, Joaquín moved abroad for the first time, agreeing a three-year deal with Italy's ACF Fiorentina. He made his competitive debut for his new team on 29 August, starting in a 0–1 home loss against Grasshopper Club Zürich in the Europa League playoff round.\n\nJoaquín's first goal for the \"Viola\" came as a substitute on 20 October 2013, in a 4–2 home win over Serie A champions Juventus FC, and his second of the league season was the only in a win at S.S.C. Napoli the following 23 March. He also played a part in the team's run to the final of the Coppa Italia, netting in a 2–0 home win over A.C. ChievoVerona in the last 16.\n\nOn 31 August 2015, Joaquín returned to Betis by signing a three-year contract. In 2017, he acquired a 2% share in his first club.\n\nOn 15 September 2019, Joaquín found the net in a 1–1 draw against Getafe CF, marking his 400th appearance for the green-and-whites – he also drew level with Julio Cardeñosa as the player with most Spanish top-tier appearances for Betis with 307. On 8 December, he scored an 18-minute hat-trick (the first of his long career) in a 3–2 home win over Athletic Bilbao, becoming the oldest player ever to achieve the feat in La Liga at the age of 38 years and 140 days, breaking the previous record of 37 years set by Alfredo Di Stéfano in 1964. At the end of the year, he agreed to an extension until 2021.\n\nJoaquín made his debut for the Spain national team on 13 February 2002 against Portugal, in a 1–1 friendly played in Barcelona. Brilliant club form for Betis saw him get called up for that year's FIFA World Cup, where he appeared twice: in his second match, the quarter-finals against co-hosts South Korea, he was involved in a couple of debatable decisions, including one incident where the linesman raised his flag for a goal kick as Joaquín was crossing a ball to Fernando Morientes, who was denied a golden goal – the argument was that the ball had crossed the line. However, replays showed that it did not; the game then went to penalties, and he was chosen to take Spain's fourth attempt – despite carrying an injury – which was blocked by Lee Woon-jae.\n\nJoaquín played again for Spain through the nation's premature exit at UEFA Euro 2004, also being selected for the 2006 World Cup. He totalled five appearances, but was not first-choice at either competition, only starting twice overall.\n\nDuring the early stages of the Euro 2008 qualification campaign, Spain lost 2–3 against Northern Ireland. After the match, Joaquín told in a Spanish radio interview: \"\"Right now, the national team is a mess, chaos and Luis doesn't know how to handle it in these difficult moments. I know that what I'm saying is not going to help me get back into the national team, but it's what I feel\".\" He later commented, \"\"The only thing I wanted to say is that these are not clear times for the national squad after losing to Northern Ireland ... but it was not my intention to attack the team or Luis Aragonés\"\"; subsequently, he failed to be selected again as the national side went on to record 35 consecutive games without defeat, winning a record 15 consecutive times and lifting the Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 trophies.\n\nJoaquín grew up in a big family, with eight brothers and sisters in total.

It was produced by TMS Entertainment and distributed, through first-run syndication, by MCA TV, years before the latter company became NBCUniversal Television Distribution. Renowned Japanese animation director Osamu Dezaki was involved as chief supervising director, and his distinctive style (as seen in \"Golgo 13\" and \"Cobra\") is evident throughout all its episodes.\n\nThe title characters of the series are a family of machine-enhanced human beings possessing unique powers after being augmented with bionic technology. Each family member is given specific bionic powers, and thus they form a superhero team called the Bionic Six.\n\nIn the near future (some unspecified decades after 1999), Professor Dr. Amadeus Sharp Ph.D., head of the Special Projects Labs (SPL), creates a new form of technology to augment humans through bionics. His first subject was Jack Bennett, a test pilot who secretly acted as Sharp's field agent, Bionic-1. On a family ski vacation in the Himalayas, an alien spacecraft triggers an avalanche that buries the entire family, exposing them to the unusual radiation of a mysterious buried object. Jack frees himself but discovers his family in a comatose state. Theorizing that Jack's bionics protected him from the radiation, Professor Sharp implants bionic technology in the others, awakening them. Afterward, the family operates incognito as a publicly lauded team of adventuring superheroes, the Bionic Six.\n\nThe primary antagonist of the series is a mad scientist known as Doctor Scarab, along with his gang of henchmenGlove, Madam-O, Chopper, Mechanic, and Klunkaccompanied by Scarab's legion of drone robots called Cyphrons. Scarab is Professor Sharp's brother. Obsessed with obtaining immortality and ruling the world, Scarab believes that the key to both goals lies in the secret bionic technology invented by his brother, ever plotting to possess it.\n\n\nThe Bennett family includes patriarch Jack, matriarch Helen, Eric, Meg, J.D., and Bunji. They live in a secluded oceanfront home in the fictional city of Cypress Cove, in northern California. Each member wears a special ring and a \"wristcomp\" (a mini-computer hardwired into the wrist), which they use to activate their bionic powers. The Bionic Six can also combine their powers by joining hands, creating a \"Bionic Link\" to amplify their abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary antagonist of the series is Dr. Scarabreal name Dr. Wilmer Sharp Ph.D., who is Amadeus Sharp's brother. Scarab is a hefty, egotistically brilliant and occasionally comical man who yearns for the secret to eternal life and world domination. His right eye has been modified with a monocle that has a low-powered scanner that can detect individuals with bionics, even when they are disguised, and a destructive, high-powered beam. In rare instances throughout the series, he seemingly demonstrates superhuman, bionic strength of his own (on at least one occasion, he picked up Mother-One effortlessly and threw her around; in another instance, he was seen carrying as much solid gold out of Fort Knox as his other bionic minionsseveral hundred pounds' worth.)He was voiced by Jim MacGeorge, who imitated the voice of George C. Scott when providing that character voice.\n\nDr. Scarab has assembled a motley team of henchmen (described below), imbued with an apparently lesser form of the same bionic powers employed by the Bionic Six. (Another one of Scarab's goals in the series is to try to figure out the secrets behind his brother's superior bionics knowledge.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Scarab has tried to create additional minions with limited success, usually due to envying interference from his existing henchmen. Some of these include:\n\n\n\nWhere covert action is called for, Scarab and his gang go disguised via their \"Bionic Masking Units.\" To disengage these electronically imparted disguises, they slam their fists to their chest insignias and exclaim, \"Hail Scarab!\" (Scarab, however, vainly exclaims, \"Hail me!\"). Doing so serves a secondary purpose the activation of a temporary strength enhancement.\n\nIn addition to his henchmen, Scarab also uses robots of his own design, called Cyphrons, in battles against the Bionic Six. The Cyphrons are, like the rest of his minions, generally incompetent but dangerous in large numbers. Attempts by Scarab to create more advanced Cyphron units are shown to backfire.\n\n\"Bionic Six\" episodes also featured a number of recurring, supporting characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first season of Bionic Six introduces viewers to the Bennett family, and to Scarab and his goons. Karate-1's origin is explored, and the mystery of his missing father is introduced. The origin of both the Bionic Six and of Scarab and his lackeys is revealed early on in the 22-episode run. The supporting characters of Dr. Fish and Perceptor are also introduced.\n\nThe second season continues on from the first seamlessly. Old supporting characters like Perceptor and Dr. Fish return, and new characters, such as the Bandroids are brought aboard. The second season includes a two-part episode titled \"I, Scarab,\" wherein Professor Sharp assembles a second Bionic Six group to rescue the original team. This second team is made up of supporting characters from prior episodes: Kaleidoscope, Perceptor, and the Bandroids.\n\nThe series finale finds several of the members from the Bionic Six trapped for a time in a dimension where the \"cartoon characters\" (with an animation style highly reminiscent of Tiny Toons and Animaniacs, an animated series TMS would, during this time, soon work on) of their favorite TV shows exist; after I.Q., Rock-One and Karate-One escape, I.Q notes that in the cartoon dimension, the characters were unaware that they were imaginary characters; he then wonders if it is at all possible that he and everyone else in the \"real\" world are cartoon characters themselves. His family dismisses his thoughts as meaningless babbleas a bunch of characters from the cartoon dimension walk outside the Bennett family's residence and break the fourth wall as the episode fades out.\n\nProduced by LJN in 1986, the line consisted of 13 figures (Jack, Helen, J.D., Eric, Meg, Bunji, F.L.U.F.F.I., Doctor Scarab, Glove, Mechanic, Madame-O, Chopper, and Klunk), five vehicles and one playset. These figures and vehicles were made up of plastic and die-cast metal with some of the figures having transparent limbs. The 13 figures were designed and copyrighted by Paul Samulski on behalf of LJN. F.L.U.F.F.I. the robot ape was difficult to find early in the show's release, but became easier to come by later as the line lost popularity. Today, the line remains moderately collectible with the playset and vehicles being the hardest to come across.\n\nGrosset & Dunlap Publishing produced the \"Bionic Six Super Picture Book\", a collection of color and black & white pin-ups of the Bionic Six, Dr. Sharp, F.L.U.F.F.I., and Scarab's team. The books's art was supplied by Vince Perez and Lisa Santangelo.\n\nA \"Bionic Six\" comic book (illustration credited to \"Espinoza & Hooper\" <nowiki>[sic]</nowiki>) advertised mid-1988 for forthcoming release by independent publisher New Comics Group never materialized.\n\n"}

It is a regular stop on the PGA Tour and has hosted the PGA Championship three times. It is the current home of the Bridgestone Senior Players Championship through 2022.\n\nThe club comprises three courses—those of the North, South, and West. In 1974 the club hosted three televised golf events: the American Golf Classic, the CBS Golf Classic and the World Series of Golf. No other club has hosted three televised golf events in the same calendar year.\n\nOne of four World Golf Championships constituent events, the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, directed by the International Federation of PGA Tours and sanctioned on the PGA and European Tours, was contested at the club with the final event at the club held in 2018. The North and West courses also serve as the home course for the University of Akron Zips golf team.\n\nHarvey Firestone commissioned the club in 1929 as a park for employees of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Its first course, the South, was designed by Bert Way and opened on August 10, 1929, with Firestone driving the first ball. For the sixth and final Rubber City Open Invitational in 1959, the course was at par 71.\n\nA major redesign by Robert Trent Jones in 1960 for the PGA Championship added over fifty bunkers and two ponds, and extended the course to at par 70. The course was renovated by Golforce in 2007 and played at for the WGC event in 2015.\n\nThe North course was designed by Jones and opened in 1969. Firestone's West was the last course to be added, opening in 1989. First conceived by Geoffrey Cornish and Brian Silva, it went through a redesign in 2002 by Tom Fazio.\n\nFirestone Country Club was acquired by ClubCorp in 1981, purchased from the Firestone family.\n\nA driving range was added in 1994 and was the first area of the club open to the public. A nine-hole course, the Raymond C. Firestone, was opened for public play in 1995.\n\nThe Rubber City Open was the first tournament held at Firestone, from 1954 through 1959. The PGA Championship has been held at the South Course three times: 1960, 1966, and 1975. This exposure led to a new event, the American Golf Classic, which ran from 1961 through 1976.\n\nSince 1962, the World Series of Golf, now known as the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, has been held at Firestone, usually on the South course. An unofficial four-man event over 36 holes through 1975, it became a limited field event over 72 holes in 1976.\n\nDuring the third round of the PGA Championship in 1975, Jack Nicklaus pulled out a remarkable par on the 16th hole, considered to be the hardest hole on Firestone's courses. Trailing Bruce Crampton by four strokes after two rounds, Nicklaus gained eight shots on Saturday to lead by four after 54 holes and won his fourth PGA Championship. Tiger Woods also had a memorable moment on the South course when his \"shot in the dark\" on the 72nd hole at the WGC event in 2000 ensured victory by eleven strokes. He had won the PGA Championship the previous week for his third consecutive major championship that season.\nThe North course is used less frequently in televised events, but hosted the American Golf Classic in 1976 and the World Series of Golf in 1994.\n\n\nThis course was designed from the start to be championship level and has been the host of over 70 professional tournaments. After a triple-bogey at the 16th hole in the third round of the PGA Championship in 1960, Arnold Palmer called it a \"monster.\" The name stayed and struck such a chord with frustrated golfers that the entire South course is now known fondly as \"The Monster.\"\n\n\nA championship level course, the North is famous for its many lakes and streams. While considered the most scenic course of the three, it has only been host to two tournaments.\n\n\nThe final championship course on the grounds and host to the annual Ohio Senior Open.\n\n"}

Curtis dismisses their criticisms, until Lisa explains that improved technology does not count for story and characterization.

One of the school's parking lots is on Memorial Drive; a smaller one is on Bullock Road. Some parents have parked off of school property and crossed busy streets with their children when dropping them off or picking them up.\n\nThe town operated between eight and one dozen small school districts throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, and well into the 20th century. These schoolhouses were typically of one or two rooms, were heated by woodstoves, and featured outhouses as their only form of plumbing. As part of the town's post-war planning, it was decided to construct a centrally-located elementary school for all the town's students.\n\nIsrael T. Almy of Fall River was selected as the architect, and the school was constructed from 1949 - 1950. The eight-room grammar school replaced all the town's schoolhouses when opened in 1950. It housed grades 1-8 until 1972, when grades 5-8 moved to the new George R. Austin Middle School (now the George R. Austin Intermediate School). Kindergarten and preschool programs have also been added, bringing the current grade span to PreK-3.\n\nThe building has been extensively remodelled and expanded, most recently in 1999-2002, and prior to that in at least 1965. A new gymnasium was constructed in 1965, and replaced in 2002, leaving the original gymnasium/auditorium to function solely as an auditorium.

It traces its history back to the 12th century when Bishop Absalon founded a monastery at the site, which was confiscated by the Crown after the Reformation, and ever since, on and off, it has served as an educational institution, in a variety of forms, including as a knight academy founded by Christian IV and a venue for higher learning during the Danish Golden Age. Danish writer and academian Ludvig Holberg bequested most of his fortune to re-establishing the academy in 1750 after a devastating fire.\n\nSorø Academy traces its history back to 1140 when Archbishop Absalon founded the Cistercian Sorø Abbey in a remote woodlands setting on the shores of Lake Sorø on the island of Zealand. It developed into the most prominent and wealthy monastery in Denmark. After the Reformation in 1536, the Crown confiscated the Catholic Church's properties and the former abbey served first as an educational institution for Protestant priests before Frederick II turned it into a boarding school for an equal number of noble and commoner boys.\n\nSorø Academy was founded in 1623 when Christian IV turned the boarding school into an Equestrian Academy. Later attempts were made to transform it into a university proper but it only existed as such for about 20 years before closing in 1665.\n\nAfter the closure the premises continued as a school until 1737. Efforts were made to reestablish the academy and around 1740, under the reign of Christian VI, the old buildings were rebuilt by Lauritz de Thurah, yet the plans did not materialize until Ludvig Holberg, who had no heirs, was persuaded to bequest his considerable fortune to the institution. The agreement which was ultimately settled upon exempted Holberg from paying taxes from the proceeds of his lands and to reach this end he was ennobled with title of Baron.\n\nHolberg was also consulted on the organization of the academy and the appointment of professors. Jens Schielderup Sneedorff was appointed professor in political sciences on his recommendation in 1751.\n\nThe main wing burnt down in a fire in 1813 but was rebuilt from 1822 to 1827 to the design of Peder Malling. In 1825, before the rebuilding had been completed, the Sorø Academy reopened once again. Over the next decades it became a central venue of the Danish Golden Age with Bernhard Severin Ingemann as a central figure. Both N. F. S. Grundtvig, Hans Christian Andersen and Bertel Thorvaldsen visited the Academy during this period.\n\nThe current main wing is designed by Peder Malling in a Neoclassical style which relies more on Greek than Roman architecture for its inspiration. It interior has decorative works by Georg Hilker.\n\nThe Academy is surrounded by an English-style park known as the Academy Garden. Located in the park is the \"Vænget\" building which contains Adam Wilhelm Hauch's \"Physical Cabinet\", one of the largest collections of scientific instruments in Europe.\n\nThe conventual church is an example of Cistercian craftsmanship. It is the third longest church in Denmark, and is one of the first Danish churches built of brick. The Reformation whitewashed the traditional decorations of the church; recently the ancient murals have been uncovered and in part restored. Holberg is buried in the church, as are King Valdemar Atterdag (1340–1375) and his father King Christopher II (1276–1332).\n\nThe gatehouse is the oldest inhabited building in Denmark today. It is where Saxo Grammaticus wrote the famous chronicles 'Gesta Danorum', a medieval historical work recounting the early Christian history of Scandinavia.\n\nTwo former professor's residences, today known as Molbech's House and Ingemann's House, survived the fire in 1813 and date from Lauritz de Thurah's rebuilding of the Academy in 1740.\n\nThe old well, stemming from the original abbey, was in 1915 topped by a well house designed by Martin Nyrop, one of the schools former students.\n\nOther buildings are the Rector's House, the \"Alumnatet\" and the Library Building.\n\nThe current school has 630 students, of which 140 are boarders and the rest day students from Sorø, Ringsted and the surrounding countryside.\n\nThe library has a large collection of old and rare books.\n\nWilhelm Hauch's physical\" Physical Cabinet\", one of the largest collections of scientific instruments in Europe.\n\nSorø Academy Foundation (\"Stiftelsen Sorø Akademi\") owns approximately 6000 hectares of land, mainly covered by forest.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 23, 2003. It was written by John Swartzwelder, and directed by Mark Kirkland. The episode sees the Simpson family travel to the United Kingdom for vacation. There, they meet several celebrities including Tony Blair, Evan Marriott, Ian McKellen and J. K. Rowling, who all appear as themselves. Later, Homer is arrested and locked in the Tower of London for accidentally crashing into the Queen's carriage. Meanwhile, Abraham Simpson journeys to find Edwina, his long lost love, who is voiced by Jane Leeves.\n\nMr. Burns withdraws a $1000 bill from an ATM, but he drops it and an updraft carries it away to the Simpsons' house, where it is found by Bart and Milhouse. Marge makes Bart and Homer put up fliers so that the person who lost the bill can reclaim it. No one can describe it correctly so Lisa suggests that they spend the money on something for Marge. Marge desires a dream vacation, but decides against this because Homer always manages to ruin any trip they go on. After realizing he can make money from the bill, Bart displays it in a museum in his tree house. Mr. Burns visits and reclaims his money, forcing Bart to close his museum. However, Bart has made over $3000 from the museum so he reconsiders Lisa's suggestion and decides to spend the money on a vacation for Marge. Grampa suggests they go to Britain, where he hopes to meet his long-lost love Edwina. During World War II, he made love to her the night before he was shipped out to the front lines on D-Day.\n\nUpon their arrival in London the family is greeted by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, whom Homer mistakes for Mr. Bean. They visit London's tourist attractions, and later meet J. K. Rowling and Ian McKellen. Grampa tries to contact Edwina whilst Bart and Lisa go on a \"sugar rush\" after discovering the joys of British candy. Homer and Marge rent a Mini Cooper and start to drive around London but get stuck on Hyde Park Corner. After literally driving in circles for hours, Homer decides to break out of it, plows straight through the gates of Buckingham Palace and slams into Queen Elizabeth II's horse-drawn carriage.\n\nHomer is put on trial for causing harm to the Queen as well as wrecking her carriage. He humiliates himself by calling the Queen an impostor, since her luggage is inscribed \"H.R.H.\" which he believes is short for \"Henrietta R. Hippo\", and mistaking the judge for a woman due to the wig he is wearing. The Queen, highly offended, demands that he be executed. At the Tower of London where he awaits his execution, he is called from outside by his family and Lisa tells him that he can use a secret tunnel that Sir Walter Raleigh built to escape. However, the tunnel leads straight into the Queen's bedroom, and she calls her guards. Homer pleads with the Queen to find it in her heart to forgive him and she allows him to leave the country on the condition that he take Madonna back to America with him. As they prepare to leave, Edwina appears and introduces Abe to her daughter Abbie, who is essentially a British female version of Homer. Realising he is her father, Grampa runs away quickly to the plane, while Homer appears smitten by his half-sister.\n\n\"The Regina Monologues\" is the last episode written by longtime \"Simpsons\" writer John Swartzwelder (though Swartzwelder was credited for contributing to the script to \"The Simpsons Movie\"). The episode was directed by Mark Kirkland. The plot of Homer hitting the Queen's carriage was recycled from a spec script that previous \"Simpsons\" showrunning team Al Jean and Mike Reiss had pitched to \"The Golden Girls\". In that script, Dorothy Zbornak was injured after a collision with Mother Teresa's car.\n\nTony Blair recorded his part for the episode in April 2003, in ten minutes at Downing Street. Blair was sent the script early on in the writing process, and it took eight months of negotiation between Fox and Blair's director of communications Alastair Campbell before Blair could appear as a guest star. In the original script, Blair was supposed to welcome the Simpsons to the United Kingdom \"with a garland of 'genuine Newcastle coal' and hand [Marge] a complimentary Corgi\", but Campbell had them changed, as Blair \"made it very clear that he was only interested in doing the show if he could promote tourism in Britain\". The show's staff did not know whether Blair would actually record his lines until showrunner Al Jean and his wife were in London promoting the 300th episode of \"The Simpsons\". They received a call stating: \"If you go over to Downing Street tomorrow and can promise to get the recording done in 15 minutes, then the Prime Minister will do it\". Jean was \"so nervous, it was ridiculous\" when he met Blair, an event he has cited as \"one of the most fantastic moments of his life\". Blair was the top choice to guest star in the episode, but the staff did not think they had a chance to get him to appear. Blair is the only head of government to guest star in the show, with Rudy Giuliani (who played himself in the episode \"Stop! Or My Dog Will Shoot\") the only other politician to guest star.\n\nJ. K. Rowling recorded her part via satellite from her home in Scotland, and Ian McKellen recorded his over the phone. Evan Marriott, contestant on the first series of \"Joe Millionaire\" appears as himself, while Jane Leeves plays Edwina. Manchester United footballer Ryan Giggs is mentioned by Homer, something which Giggs thought was \"brilliant\".\n\nThe writers originally drew up a list of ten British celebrities they wanted to appear in the episode. The Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams (a fan of the show) was included in a draft of the script acting as a tour guide and showing some of his relatives around London. Williams had to reject the part due to other engagements. The script also included a role for a musician; the staff had hoped to get David Bowie or Morrissey for the part but nothing came together. David and Victoria Beckham were also originally sought to guest star in the episode, and would be seen bickering on the street. The idea was dropped after Blair agreed to guest star, and it was deemed that they were not famous enough (as a married couple) in the United States and so were not approached. Jean commented \"We thought about it, we didn't ask. I've heard of him because my daughter plays soccer.\"\n\nThe episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 23, 2003, and on January 9, 2004 in the United Kingdom on Sky One. Since airing the episode has received mostly positive reviews from critics. IGN.com named the episode the best of the fifteenth season, saying that \"It may not be the best episode ever, but hell if it isn't a lot of fun\", as well as calling it \"extremely funny\" and a \"high point for the past few seasons\". Tony Blair received criticism from a number of commentators for his appearance in the episode due to the fact that he recorded his part at the height of the war in Iraq. \"Sunday Telegraph\" journalist Jack Roberts noted that it was \"not [Blair's] finest hour\". On the other hand, Simon Crerar of \"The Times\" named Blair's appearance as one of the 33 best guest appearances in the show's history, and the BBC classified his appearance as a \"PR masterstroke\". The episode is included on the \"Around the World in 80 D'ohs\" DVD.\n\nWhen Blair left office in 2007, it was reported that his successor as Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, was also being lined up to guest star on the show. Animator Dan Povenmire noted that American audiences would probably require subtitles to understand what Brown was saying. Voice actress Yeardley Smith noted that she would like Brown to appear in \"The Simpsons\", but Brown ruled a guest role out stating: \"I think Tony Blair did that, I don't think that is for me\". Series creator Matt Groening confirmed that Brown would not be approached for a part. \n\nThe episode has become study material for sociology courses at University of California Berkeley, where it is used to \"examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show\", and to figure out what it is \"trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies\". Some questions asked in the courses include: \n\n"}

US Airways Group operated US Airways, along with its subsidiaries PSA Airlines, Inc. and Piedmont Airlines, Inc., which are wholly owned but marketed under the branding of US Airways Express. It merged with America West Holdings Corporation, parent of America West Airlines, in 2005, and the combined company adopted the better-known US Airways name; the two airlines' operating certificates merged in 2007. It also operates additional companies that provide associated services. ACE Aviation Holdings, the Canadian parent of Air Canada retained a roughly 6.1% investment stake in US Airways Group. The route network covered destinations in 47 states, as well as international destinations.\n\nThe company merged with AMR Corporation; the combined business began trading under the new name of American Airlines Group on December 9, 2013. The combined airlines formed the largest airline in the world. US Airways' CEO, Doug Parker, became CEO of the new company.\n\nUS Airways traces its history to All American Aviation Inc, a company founded in 1939 by du Pont family brothers Richard C. du Pont and Alexis Felix du Pont, Jr.. Headquartered in Pittsburgh, the airline served the Ohio River valley in 1939. In 1949 the company was renamed All American Airways as it switched from airmail to passenger service; it changed its name again to Allegheny Airlines on January 1,1953.\n\nIn 1979, Allegheny changed its name to USAir, and in February 1997, to US Airways.\n\nIn August 2002, US Airways Group Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection in an effort to correct its financial problems brought on by rising costs and the post-Sept. 11 drop-off in air travel.\n\nOn September 12, 2004, US Airways Group and most of its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years. US Airways Group and the aforementioned subsidiaries, including US Airways, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with the help $125 million equity investment from Air Wisconsin's parent company Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation on September 27, 2005, in connection with the completion of its merger with America West Holdings Corporation.\n\nOn May 19, 2005, US Airways Group announced that it would merge with Tempe, Arizona-based America West Holdings Corporation, whose strength in the West would complement US Airways' routes in the Northeast, Europe, and the Caribbean. Prior to merging with America West Holdings Corporation, US Airways Group was based in Arlington County, Virginia. At the time of announcement, plans called for the new entity to retain the US Airways brand, its Dividend Miles frequent flyer program, and participation in the Star Alliance (subject to the approval of partner United Airlines); however, it would be headquartered at America West's corporate offices and America West executives and board members would be in control of the merged company. The merger was completed on September 27, 2005.\n\nIn October 2006, US Airways leased new office space in a building across the street from its corporate headquarters in Tempe, Arizona to expand and centralize its Corporate operations.\n\nOn November 15, 2006, US Airways Group announced a proposal to purchase Delta Air Lines for $8.0 billion, half of this amount to be paid in cash with the remainder to be paid in stock. US Airways Group had obtained a firm commitment from Citibank to provide financing for both the cash portion of the merger offer, as well as the required secured loan refinancing at both airlines. The combined airlines would have flown under the Delta Air Lines name. Delta Air Lines repeatedly stated its intentions of exiting bankruptcy as a stand-alone carrier. On December 19, 2006, Delta's Board of Directors officially rejected US Airways offer. The final decision, however, was up to Delta Air Lines creditors as well as a bankruptcy judge as to what would happen.\n\nDelta employees, represented by the Delta Board Council and the Air Line Pilots Association, organized against what they termed the \"hostile takeover\" effort by US Airways under the title \"Keep Delta My Delta\". A rally against the US Airways merger at the Georgia International Convention Center was held December 13, 2006, and attended by nearly 3000 pilots, family members, and other supporters.\n\nOn January 10, 2007, US Airways upped their bid for Delta from $8.5 billion to $10.2 billion, and imposed a deadline of February 1 for Delta's creditors committee to move forward with the deal. The move was made, according to US Airways president Scott Kirby, to remove any doubt that the US Airways offer was the best one on the table.\n\nOn January 31, 2007, following a decision by the creditors committee to support Delta's standalone reorganization plan, US Airways withdrew its merger offer.\n\nIn January 2012, US Airways expressed interest to take over American Airlines and the AMR CEO said in March, that American is open to merger. As of September 2012, American Airlines, under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, was looking to merge with another airline. In July of that year, in a Bankruptcy Court filing US Airways disclosed that it was an American Airlines creditor and \"prospective merger partner. Then on August 31, 2012, US Airways CEO Doug Parker announced that American Airlines and US Airways had signed a nondisclosure agreement, in which the airlines would discuss their financials and a possible merger.\"\n\nOn February 14, 2013, US Airways Group and AMR Corporation officially announced that the two companies would merge to form the largest airline in the world.

This unplanned and unorganized demonstration was the largest such protest in the country's history. Beginning on the evening of August 12, 2004, the demonstration grew and continued until it was forcefully ended on the afternoon of August 13, 2004. Protesters initially demanding the freeing of the pro-reformists arrested on the afternoon of August 12, 2004. As the protest continued to grow, people demanded the resignation of president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who had been in power since 1978. What started as a peaceful demonstration ended after 22 hours, as the country's darkest day in recent history. Several people were severely injured as NSS personnel used riot batons and teargas on unarmed civilians.\n\nPursuant to the powers vested in him by Section 144 of the Constitution — and for only the second time in Maldives history — president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom declared a State of Emergency in Malé and the nearby islands a few minutes after the crackdown. Several members of the Majlis, former cabinet ministers, and many reformists were arrested. As a symbol of unity, President Gayoom pardoned all arrested following the December 26th tsunami.\n\nWhen police summoned Mr. Mohamed Yusuf, a few reform activists decided to gather near Republican Square to inquire about Yoosuf's detention. What started as a vigil at Republican Square in Malé at dusk on August 12, 2004, turned into a mass gathering of people demanding democratic reform.\n\nAs the crowd grew larger and the demands to free Mr. Yoosuf became louder, he was released that afternoon. However, the protesters demanded four other reformists detained in Dhoonidhoo detention centre be transferred to Malé. They also called for the release of Naushad Waheed, Ahmed Didi, Mohamed Zaki and Fathimath Nisreen; all of whom were, according to the Opposition movement, detained without a fair trial. By early morning August 13, 2004, a large crowd had gathered near Republican Square, the NSS building and Shaheed Hussain Adam Building. Initially the NSS and government minister Ilyas Ibrahim unsuccessfully tried to win the trust of the crowd by addressing the crowd over a megaphone. When they failed, they asked the pro-reformist MP Ibrahim Ismail (Ibra) to address the crowd in front of the NSS building. He convinced the crowd to move into nearby Republican Square. Senior MDP activist Muad Mohamed Zaki who was in the front row of the protest blocking the NSS building tried to discourage protestors from moving their position.\n\nAfter moving the crowd into Republican Square, Ibrahim Ismail addressed the crowd and assured them he would take their demands to the NSS authorities for their consideration. The crowd then gave its demands to Ibrahim Ismail, which were:\n\n\nIn the early morning, the reformists were released. They came directly from the Dhoonidhoo detention centre to Republican Square. There they addressed the crowd, criticized Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and called for his resignation. They also demanded the demonstration be reported live on state run television and radio. However, no news of the protest was transmitted yet. The crowd continued to grow and \"took (on) a life of its own\", as later described by Ibrahim Ismail in his interview on the BBC.\n\nAt around 0700 hrs Maafushi Prison was broken, thinking the government was overthrown, as the detainees got the news of the unusual protest in Malé. They headed to Malé in two Dhonis. However they were intercepted by the NSS coastguard. One of the Dhonis was sunk and the other gassed with tear gas.\n\nAs the calling for Gayoom's resignation got louder and stronger, a few pro-government people gathered to Republican Square. Some of them were sent there, according to reformists, to create violence so that use of force to disperse the crowd could be justified. Since international media was reporting the event, NSS needed a valid and justifiable reason to use force to disperse the crowd. In several occasions the pro-government crowd tried to instigate violence. However reformists ignored them and continued the demonstration, calling for the resignation.\n\nAt around 0830hrs, a person named Hussain Yoosuf stabbed two police officers. He is one of the many people who testified before the commission established to investigate the death of Evan Naseem. After this incident there was a report of fire in the nearby Huravee Building, a government office building. NSS blamed the crowd for starting the fire. In addition to this, there came a group of people who threw bottles and other objects towards the Police Headquarters. The protesters tried to stop them without any success. Police blamed reformists for these activities and portrayed them as a violent mob.\n\nAfter Friday prayers, at around 1430hrs NSS issued final warning to the crowd. However they refuse to leave the Republican square. Using the previously described commotion as an excuse, the riot police pounced on the protesters, beat them brutally with truncheons and arrested a number of protesters. Women were also beaten with truncheons and they sustained severe injuries. Ambulances were rushed to the hospital with casualties. Tear gas was used on the crowd at around 1500hrs. Senior MDP member Muad Mohamed Zaki was violently beaten by seven NSS officers with wooden planks in broad daylight as he was dragged to the NSS Headquarters. This alerted the British Parliament and European Union officials that Muad was communicating closely with while he staying in the UK representing Maldivian Democratic Party and working to free Sandhaanu political prisoners in Maldives. Thousands of protestors were blindfolded, handcuffed and beaten on that day as law and order seemed to have temporarily disappeared.\n\nPresident Maumoon Abdul Gayoom declared a State of Emergency in Malé and nearby islands, pursuant to powers vested in him by Section 144 of the Constitution, for the second time in the Maldives history. A curfew was imposed in Malé with heavy security. There were several roadblocks and check posts.\n\nAfter nearly two months, the State of Emergency was lifted due to International pressure.\nDhiraagu and Focus Infocom was forced to shut down Internet and SMS services to prevent the images, video and news of the event leaking to international media. However the events were covered and the images did leak to media despite these preventive measurements.\n\nBoth \"Television Maldives (TVM)\" and \"Voice of Maldives (VOM)\", controlled by the government, initially did not report the event as a major event. At 1400hrs news, while the protest was still going, TVM reported that \"only a small crowd had gathered and caused disharmony at the Republican Square, the people who caused this had been noted and that action will be taken against them\". At 2000hrs news, after declaring the State of Emergency, TVM downplayed the size of the protesters, and called the gathering \"illegal in every possible sense\".\n\nSpecial programs were aired on Radio and Television to cover-up the real reason behind the protest. It was portrayed by the local media to be a violent mob that attacked police building, government properties and attack police officers. One sided, biased reporting was aired for weeks on the local media.\n\nOn August 12, 2005, to mark the first anniversary of the Black Friday, members of the Maldivian Democratic Party and pro-reformists started gathering near Republican Square. Despite heavy police and NSS presence, at around 4:30pm local time Mohamed Nasheed - Chairman of the MDP - along with other several leading members of the party, decided to gather at Republican square. Security was tight around Malé due to the obvious perceptibility of such a demonstration to mark this anniversary. Two days before, on August 10, 2005, NSS announced that they will be conducting a huge training exercise in Malé for four days, starting from August 11, 2005.\n\nDespite heavy police presence, Mohamed Nasheed decided to sit right in the center of the Republican Square with his colleagues. Minutes later he was approached by a team of Maldives Police Service. They approached him and asked him to simply \"go away\" from there. Nasheed demanded to know why he was asked to leave while he is not committing anything illegal. The leader of this team responded by saying such gatherings are illegal and they will have to remove him by force if not obeyed within five minutes. To this ultimatum, Nasheed responded by saying. \"You will give us five minutes, after that, what? You will beat us to death?\" At one time Nasheed asked the police to join them, since he is not inciting violence but peacefully sitting there. Since he refused to leave the spot, the police team moved towards the flag pole few meters away.\n\nAt around 4:23pm, riot police moved into Republican Square. Soon they surrounded Mohamed Nasheed along with other members of the party, present with him. Nasheed and his colleagues still refused to stand up. Members of riot police then forcefully removed them and had them taken into the nearby NSS headquarters. This led to civil unrest in Malé and some other atolls, that lasted for three nights. The unrest was controlled and several people were arrested.\n\n\n"}

The elementary schools (originally 1-6, subsequently K-4) were controlled by each town's school committee, owned by each town individually, and were not subject in any way to the other town. The regional schools (originally Apponequet, subsequently Apponequet and the then-Austin Middle School) were likewise controlled by both towns under the District.\n\nUnder this system, an elementary school teacher is employed by either Freetown or Lakeville, but a middle or high school teacher is employed by the District. The Superintendent and other main administrative personnel are actually employed by three different entities: Freetown, Lakeville, and Freetown-Lakeville.\n\nA theoretical \"third tier\" was added in 2004 when the former Austin Middle School reopened as the George R. Austin Intermediate School. GRAIS contained not only the District's fifth grade, but Lakeville's local fourth grade, creating a system where one building was under the control of two different school committees. This has led to minor confusion over which entity is ultimately responsible for the building, even though it remains the property of both towns. This was eliminated in 2009 with the fourth graders moving back to Assawompsett. For the 2012-2013 school year 4th grade will be added from both towns to George R. Austin Intermediate School. Fifth grade will remain as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents in grades 9 to 12 that wish to attend a Vocational Technical High School may attend Old Colony Regional Vocational Technical High School. Note that Lakeville is a member town while Freetown is not and students are limited to about 90 from Freetown. Students in grades 9 to 12 that wish to attend an Agricultural High School may attend Bristol County Agricultural High School. Technically, students from Lakeville could apply to Norfolk County Agricultural High School, as they are in Plymouth County, but in practice they apply to Bristol Aggie. Students could also go to local private high schools.\n\nLakeville students receives buses from Old Colony while Freetown receives buses from Freetown-Lakeville. Freetown students must take an Apponequet bus and then transfer at Apponequet to an Old Colony bus from Apponequet.\n\nStudents attending Bristol County Agricultural High School receive buses from Bristol County Aggie unlike Old Colony Students. However, Students must take an Apponequet bus and then transfer to a Bristol County Agricultural bus from Apponequet.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2022992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022992", "title": "Tormato", "text": "Tormato\n\nTormato is the ninth studio album by English progressive rock band Yes. It was released on 22 September 1978 on Atlantic Records, and is their last album with singer Jon Anderson and keyboardist Rick Wakeman before their departure from the group in 1980 and the last album to feature the lineup of Anderson, Wakeman, Chris Squire, Steve Howe and Alan White until 1996's \"Keys to Ascension\".\n\nAfter touring in support of their previous album, \"Going for the One\" (1977), the band entered rehearsals in London to record a follow-up album. Several factors hindered its potential including group disagreements over its overall direction, the decision not to use an external producer, and its uneven quality.\n\nThe album received a mixed response from critics yet it became a commercial success. It reached No. 8 in the UK and No. 10 in the US, where it became the band's fastest selling album and reached platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America within two months for selling one million copies. \"Don't Kill the Whale\" was released as a single that reached No. 36 in the UK. The band's 1978–1979 tour was their first with concerts performed in the round on a central revolving stage. \"Tormato\" was remastered in 2004 containing previously unreleased tracks from the album's recording sessions.\n\nIn December 1977, the Yes line-up of Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Steve Howe, Alan White and Rick Wakeman wrapped their 1977 tour of North America and Europe in support of their eighth album, \"Going for the One\" (1977). The album marked a return to commercial success after it went to number one in the UK for two weeks and spawned a UK top-10 single in \"Wonderous Stories\". The 84-date tour was considerably taxing on the group, and they took a short break at its conclusion.\n\nYes reconvened at Sound Associates in Bayswater, London in mid-February 1978 to write and rehearse material for a new studio album. The majority of the songs on \"Tormato\" were written during soundchecks and rehearsals on the 1977 tour, as the group decided to develop fresh ideas rather than using older material. The original plan was for Yes to release \"Tormato\" in two parts, with the first put out in July 1978 and the second by Christmas time. The second release was to be completed in Barbados, but this never happened and a single album was released instead. The album's original working title was \"Eleventh Illusion\", a reference to the band's desire to base their live stage sets around illusions.\n\n\"Tormato\" was recorded from February to June 1978, and is the band's first recorded in two different London studios, Advision Studios in Fitzrovia and RAK Studios in Regent's Park. Initially they were split where the recording should take place; Howe and Squire wished to stay in London and suggested somewhere \"warm and comfortable and easy\", while others preferred to return to Switzerland where they had recorded \"Going for the One\". The early studio sessions saw the return of Eddie Offord working with the band as their engineer and producer since \"Relayer\" (1974), but his involvement came to an end soon after. Left without a producer, the band decided to produce and mix the album themselves and hired Geoff Young and Nigel Luby, who had assisted with the production of \"Going for the One\", as the engineers. This way of working caused internal issues as Wakeman recalled: \"No one was afraid to say, 'Well, Jon, I think you should sing this part.' Or 'Steve, that's a bad guitar part.' Tempers got frayed.\" Howe agreed with the view, and believed such tensions affected the album's sound quality and tone as a result. By the end of the recording sessions, Yes had recorded enough material to fit on one and a half albums. \"Tormato\" was released with eight tracks, the highest number on a Yes studio album since \"Fragile\" (1971).\n\nThe album features the band playing new instruments that were not used on previous Yes albums. By the time of recording, Wakeman had changed his keyboard rig to incorporate the Polymoog, a polyphonic analog synthesiser which he said was used mainly for \"soloing and filling\", and the Birotron, a tape relay keyboard which he had co-funded during its development and manufacturing four years earlier. Wakeman reduced the number of keyboards he typically used so the tracks could relate to each other, thus creating an album that \"flowed a bit more\". In one incident, the band laid a prank on Wakeman while he was on a break by replacing the Birotron cartridges with a tape of Seals and Crofts. Howe said: \"When he pressed the keys he went, 'What the hell is this?'\" and \"got quite cross\". Looking back on the album a year after its release, Wakeman admitted he got it \"60 percent right and 40 percent wrong\", and wished he played things differently. One of Howe's criticisms of \"Tormato\" was that the Polymoog and Birotron did not complement his guitar sound and noted they often \"cancel each other out\". Squire felt as if Wakeman and Howe tried to play more notes than the other in a single bar, which was caused after Anderson would put down basic chords on an acoustic guitar and then take it out of the mix, leaving gaps in the music. Howe picked out \"Madrigal\", \"Release, Release\", and \"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\" as the tracks he liked best.\n\nIn 2013, engineer and producer Brian Kehew, who has worked on the remastering of other Yes albums, explained that that the album sounds \"thin, flat and terrible\". He said that Offord usually incorporated Dolby A, a type of Dolby noise-reduction system, in his production work. However, upon examination of the original tapes he could not locate any sign that Dolby A was used. But when he applied Dolby A to the tapes, \"[...] everything – except from the overdubs – sounded amazing\". Kehew then realised that the engineers who replaced Offord during the album's production may not have known that the Dolby reduction had been used.\n\nAnderson wrote the music and lyrics to \"Future Times/Rejoice\" and said his words are more explicit in meaning than his usual style. It features Squire playing bass with a Mu-Tron pedal effect.\n\n\"Don't Kill the Whale\" originated from a bass line and a passage on an acoustic guitar that Squire had devised which he presented to Anderson, who proceeded to write lyrical ideas off of it using a poem that he had written on the subject as a basis. The acoustic line was worked into the song's chorus. The keyboard solo involved Wakeman adapting a sound that he had configured on his Polymoog which produced \"weird sounds\" that resembled a whale.\n\n\"Madrigal\" features Wakeman playing a Thomas Goff harpsichord. Anderson had suggested to Wakeman that they write a madrigal, a form of English evening song.\n\n\"Release, Release\" was developed by Anderson and White, and features automatic double tracking applied onto White's drum tracks to achieve a bigger sound. Its original title was \"The Anti-Campaign\", referring to the political and social changes at the time before it was changed in favour of the lyric \"Release, release\" that is sung multiple times at the end. The instrumental section includes a crowd cheering with the guitar and drum solo, which Wakeman reasoned was added because it \"sounded a bit dry\" on its own. He claimed the crowd was taken from an English football match. Atlantic Records president Ahmet Ertegun visited Yes in the studio and heard \"Release, Release\", which he liked and suggested the whole album sound like it. The song was difficult for Anderson to sing on stage as the many high notes in the song strained his voice, and it was dropped early into the tour.\n\n\"Arriving UFO\" is based on a tune that Anderson had developed, inspired to write a science-fiction song having seen \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977) twice. Wakeman wrote the instrumental section.\n\n\"Circus of Heaven\" tells the story of a travelling fantasy circus and its visit to a Midwestern town, featuring unicorns, centaurs, elves, and fairies. Its direction came from Anderson's pursuit of writing songs aimed at children, and gained inspiration from a book by Ray Bradbury ten years before which he subsequently told to his son Damion, who speaks at the end of the song. Squire thought the track was an interesting one musically as it features him playing a reggae-style bass riff.\n\n\"Onward\" is solely credited to Squire, who had produced a demo version of the song on vocals and piano and presented it to the band. It features orchestral arrangements by his friend Andrew Pryce Jackman, who had worked with Squire as members of The Syn and on Squire's solo album \"Fish Out of Water\" (1975). Squire later considered \"Onward\" as one of the best songs he ever wrote. \"Onward\" was performed live in 1996 and features an acoustic guitar introduction from Howe entitled \"Unity\". This was released on their live/studio album \"Keys to Ascension\" (1996).\n\n\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\" features Squire playing with a Mu-Tron Envelope Shaper effect.\n\nAs with \"Going for the One\", the album's cover was designed by Hipgnosis but retains the band's logo designed by Roger Dean. Howe pitched the album's original title of \"Yes Tor\", referring to Yes Tor, the second highest hill on Dartmoor, an area of moorland in Devon, England. Wakeman claimed to have thrown a tomato at the pictures taken for the album as he recalled the band were disappointed with the initial artwork which had cost a lot of money. The album's title and cover was changed accordingly. Howe said it was someone at Hipgnosis who threw the tomato and they did so on purpose, which insulted him. According to White, the band was unable to decide on a cover: \"I think Po ... put a picture of a guy with divining sticks on the front. He took it home one night and decided it wasn't working. So he threw a tomato at it\". Yes manager Brian Lane said the band disliked the pictures that Hipgnosis had taken at Yes Tor, \"and we threw the tomatoes. [...] It wasn't Rick\".\n\nThe sleeve includes a photograph of the band that was taken in Regent's Park, London, with each member wearing a bomber jacket and sunglasses and looking in a different direction. Each jacket was labelled with the member's name on the front, but Squire had forgotten his and had to wear one labelled \"Jim\", belonging to tour manager Jim Halley. The word \"Chris\" was then drawn onto the final cover.\n\n\"Tormato\" was released in the UK on 22 September 1978. Upon its release in the US, the album was broadcast in its entirety on WIOQ in Philadelphia at midnight on 29 September. It reached No. 8 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 10 on the US \"Billboard\" 200. \"Don't Kill the Whale\" was released as a single in September 1978 and peaked at No. 36 in the UK singles chart. It became the band's first album to be certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nSteve Pond gave a mixed review of \"Tormato\" in \"The Los Angeles Times\" who thought the album lacked distinctive melodies and are replaced by experimental and extended instrumental sections similar to that of \"Tales from Topographic Oceans\" (1973) and \"Relayer\" (1974) which made them \"distant and unappetizing\". However, Pond continues to note that \"eventually, it emerges as one of Yes' strongest and most important albums\" with its balance of songs that display the band's traditional sound along with the contemporary progressive rock approach in the U.K.. He picked up on the album's \"raw energy and forcefulness\" which made \"Going for the One\" such a success, with \"Future Times/Rejoice\" as a good example of the band's new approach and praised White and Squire as a rhythm section. Pond was critical of \"Arriving UFO\" and \"Circus of Heaven\", two tracks that are overwhelmed with \"studio trickery and sound effects\". A review in \"The Morning News\" ranked the album as sub-par to \"Going for the One\" as the majority of the songs lacked a distinct melody, \"rhythmic thrust\", or rock sound than the previous album's title track. It ranked \"Future Times/Rejoice\" as the best track on \"Tormato\". In \"The Pittsburgh Press\", Pete Bishop noted the hard rock sound of \"Going for the One\" continues on \"Tormato\" though it's \"not the best idiom\" for Anderson's vocals but cites \"Don't Kill the Whale\" and \"Release, Release\" as highlight tracks. Nonetheless he notes that \"it's hard to fault any of the music on this album\" with each member \"playing up a storm\", but continues to say that the songs never get further \"than your eardrums\" because of the \"rapid, say-nothing lyrics it always has\".\n\nIn the \"Detroit Free Press\", reviewer Bill Braunstein ranked the album as the band's best album since \"Close to the Edge\" and contains \"all the Yes trademarks\" of \"intricate sophisticated arrangements\", Anderson's \"undecipherable\" lyrics and a \"strongly stylized sound\". To Braunstein, \"Tormato\" contains no weak tracks, though Howe's guitar work on \"Don't Kill the Whale\" make up for what he considered \"a little hackneyed in its sentiments\". He picked \"Onward\" as the strongest track, and Wakeman's keyboards as the factor that \"really bring the album together\". Chris Carson in the \"Press and Sun-Bulletin\" was more positive, thinking \"Tormato\" as the most accessible album since \"The Yes Album\" (1971) as it is \"simply fun to listen to\" and puts it down to the success of side one. He wrote \"Future Times/Rejoice\" and \"Don't Kill the Whale\" are \"uncluttered\" and boast \"peppy qualities\" that feature Anderson's \"dreamy vocals\" and Wakeman's \"rollercoasting\" keyboards. Carson compared \"Arriving UFO\" as \"Pink Floyd territory\" that continues the hectic pace of side one, before \"Circus of Heaven\" and \"Onward\" reveal his major criticism with \"Tormato\" in that both \"dreamy\" songs follow one another until \"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\" creates a \"quick recovery\". Band biographer Chris Welch summarised the main subject of criticism for the album is the production quality, typified by a compressed and dull sound.\n\nWakeman said the album became a \"tragedy\" as it had poor artwork and production, but good music.\n\n\nYes supported the album with a 101-date tour of North America and the UK between 28 August 1978 and 30 June 1979. It marked their first tour with the group performing in-the-round that featured a six-ton, £50,000 revolving stage with a 360-degree lighting system fitted above it. The idea was conceived by their longtime lighting technician Michael Tait who then worked with Clair Brothers to develop the sound system to go with it. The driving mechanism that moved the stage failed during an early gig, resulting in the band's roadies having to push it by hand. The 1978 leg included four consecutive sold out nights at Madison Square Garden in New York City that sold out in three days and earned the group a Gold Ticket Award for selling 100,000 tickets and grossing over $1 million in box office receipts. Yes performed three additional dates there in June 1979.\n\nCredits adapted from the album's 1978 liner notes.\n\nYes\n\nProduction\n\nCitations\nSources\n"}

He is currently an Australian television personality who appears regularly on Nine Network shows, the \"AFL Footy Show\", \"Getaway\", \"Postcards\" and \"Kids' WB\".\n\nCrawford spent his childhood in Finley, New South Wales, and played his junior football with the Finley Football Club. He attended boarding school at Assumption College in Kilmore, Victoria and was selected by Hawthorn with the 13th pick in the 1991 AFL Draft. He made his debut in 1993.\n\nCrawford played 305 career AFL games. He is also a four-time All-Australian player and played in three International Rules series for Australia. He became captain of Hawthorn in 1999 and that season also won the AFL's top individual honours, the Brownlow Medal and the Leigh Matthews Trophy. He has won four Hawthorn \"Best & Fairest Awards\" (1998, 1999, 2002, 2003) and came equal fourth in the Brownlow in 2003, losing to the winners by one vote. He was also a member of Hawthorn's 2008 premiership side.\n\nCrawford stepped down from the Hawthorn captaincy after the 2004 season, in which he broke his arm and the Hawks finished second last on the AFL ladder. He regained some form in the 2005 season, during which he played his 250th AFL game against the Brisbane Lions at the Gabba, and was again one of the league's leading possession winners.\n\nHe played his 300th game for Hawthorn against the Brisbane Lions in Round 19 in 2008 in Launceston when Hawthorn defeated the Lions by 69 points.\n\nOn 27 September 2008, Crawford won his first premiership in his 305th AFL match, aged 34. He played more AFL games before receiving his first premiership medal than any other player.\n\nCrawford was offered another year with the Hawks, but he announced his retirement, wanting to go out on a high note. He ended his career after Hawthorn won the 2008 Grand Final and is now remembered as one of the greatest midfielders in the modern era of AFL football.\n\nIn 2012, Crawford was inducted in the Australian Football Hall of Fame.\n\nCrawford is currently a presenter on Channel Nine, being part of two current shows. He was a regular panel member of the sports program \"The AFL Footy Show\" (from 2009 until its axing in 2019); a presenter on holiday and destination programs \"Getaway\" and \"Postcards\" (since 2008), and a presenter on the children's program \"Kids' WB\" (since 2014). In 2011, he was also a contestant on the first season of Channel 9's series \"The Celebrity Apprentice\", on which celebrities compete for charities of their choosing. Crawford raised $49,311 for his charity, the Breast Cancer Network Australia. He finished third overall behind dance guru Jason Coleman and actor/comedian Julia Morris.\n\nIn 2009 Crawford set five Guinness world records during broadcasts of \"The Footy Show\".\n\nIn 2010, Crawford released his autobiography, \"That's What I'm Talking About\", written in conjunction with Glenn McFarlane and released in soft-cover and eBook editions. A Junior Edition (eBook) was released later.\n\nIn March 2014, a series of children's books with football themes, co-authored by Crawford and Adrian Beck were released. The books revolve around the character \"Nick\" who is the captain of the Cobar Creek Crocs football team. The four books, released in paperback and eBook formats, are: \"Crawf's Kick it to Nick: The Cursed Cup\", \"Crawf's Kick it to Nick: Outbreak on the Oval\", \"Crawf's Kick it to Nick: Bugs from Beyond\" and \"Crawf's Kick it to Nick: Forward Line Freak\".\n\nOn 16 September 2010, Crawford completed a 780 km run named \"That's What I'm Walking About\" from Rundle Mall in Adelaide to the Channel 9 studio in Melbourne to raise awareness for breast cancer. He took a total of 11 days to complete the run and, as a welcome into Melbourne, ran the final leg into the Channel 9 \"Footy Show's\" studio where the panel and crowd awaited his arrival. Hundreds of \"pink ladies\" who were affected in some way by breast cancer showed their appreciation and support by making way for Crawford as he ran into the studio. Crawford appeared humbled and initially struggled to come to terms with what he had achieved and the stories that he had heard along the journey from breast cancer sufferers and family/friends of those with breast cancer. His efforts raised $500,000 for the cause.\n\nIn June and July 2013, Crawford cycled 3,600 km from Melbourne to Perth in a fundraising event named \"Tour de Crawf\" that took place over 22 days. He averaged nearly 170 km per day and in total he raised $1,328,249 for the Breast Cancer Network Australia.\n\nIn October 2000, Crawford was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for services to Australian football.\n\nCrawford and his longtime partner Olivia Anderson have four sons: Charlie (born 2006), Benjamin (born 2008), and twins Jack and Harry (born 2011).

{"id": "2023013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2023013", "title": "Polybrominated biphenyl", "text": "Polybrominated biphenyl\n\nPolybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), also called brominated biphenyls or polybromobiphenyls, are a group of manufactured chemicals that consist of polyhalogenated derivatives of a biphenyl core. Their chlorine analogs are the PCBs. While once widely used commercially, PBBs are now controlled substances under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, which limits their use in electrical and electronic products sold in the EU.\n\nPBBs usually exist as colorless to off-white solids. PBBs soften at 72 degrees Celsius and decompose above 300 degrees Celsius. They have low vapor pressure, are very soluble in benzene and toluene, and insoluble in water. They are degraded by UV light.\n\nPBBs are used as flame retardants of the brominated flame retardant group. They are added to plastics used in products such as home electrical appliances, textiles, plastic foams, laptop cabinets, etc. to make them difficult to burn.\n\nExposure to the coplanar stereoisomer 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (but not the non-coplanar stereoisomer) in genetically susceptible mice is known to cause immunotoxicity and disorders related to the central nervous system, and even at doses as low as 2.5 mg/kg, excess neonatal fatalities are observed (LD is from 5–10 mg/kg). The mechanism of toxicity is cellular oxidative stress by aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation.\n\nThere is evidence that pre- and post-natal exposure to PBB in girls leads to menarche at an earlier age.\n\nEarly studies on the effects of PBBs on human beings concerned the people in Michigan, United States who consumed PBB-contaminated animal products (see history of PBBs below). A study of 327 girls aged 5–24 years in Michigan found those who were exposed \"in utero\" to PBBs at or above a level of 7 ppb found had an earlier age at menarche compared to a case-control group. Michigan dairy farmers exposed to PBBs had significant immune system abnormalities including reduced numbers of circulating blood lymphocytes, increases in lymphocytes with no detectable surface markers, and reduced functional response to specific test antigens. Some residents complained of nausea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, joint pain and lethargy, though it could not be clearly established that PBBs were the cause of these health problems.\nWorkers who were exposed to PBB during PBB production suffered hypothyroidism, although no deterioration in memory performance was found in PBB-exposed workers in tests conducted several years after final PBB exposure, and there was also no correlation of performance with PBB concentration.\n\nThere is stronger evidence that PBBs may have caused skin problems, such as acne, in consumers of the contaminated food. Some workers exposed to PBBs by breathing and skin contact for days to months also developed acne.\n\nStudies in animals exposed to large amounts of PBBs for a short period or to smaller amounts over a longer period show that PBBs can cause weight loss, skin disorders, nervous and immune systems effects, as well as effects on the liver, kidneys, and thyroid gland.\n\nIt is not known for certain if PBBs could cause cancer in human beings, but it has been observed that they can lead to cancer in lab mice exposed to very high concentrations of PBBs. Based on such animal tests, the United States Department of Health and Human Services has determined that PBBs may reasonably be anticipated to be carcinogens. The International Agency for Research on Cancer also suggests that PBBs are possibly carcinogenic to humans.\n\nBefore the 1970s, PBBs were widely used commercially as a flame retardant. Michigan Chemical Corporation (owned by Velsicol Chemical Corporation) in St. Louis, Michigan was a major producer of the FireMaster range of PBB-based flame retardants. FireMaster BP-6 (a yellow-brown powder) is a mixture of many different PBB congeners with 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl and 2,2',3,4,4',5,5'-heptabromobiphenyl being significant constituents by mass (60-80% and 12-25%, respectively). FireMaster FF-1 (a white powder) is FireMaster BP-6 with the addition of 2% calcium silicate as an anti-caking agent. Mixed bromochlorobiphenyls and polybrominated naphthalenes, as well as lower brominated compounds formed by incomplete bromination, have also been found as minor constituents of FireMaster products.\n\nIn 1973, several thousand pounds of FireMaster BP-6 were accidentally mixed with livestock feed that was distributed to farms in Michigan, United States. Some 1.5 million chickens, 30,000 cattle, 5,900 pigs, and 1,470 sheep then consumed this feed, became contaminated with PBBs and the carcasses were disposed of in landfill sites throughout the state. In 1976, the Michigan Department of Community Health established a PBB registry to gather and analyze data on exposed residents. It now resides at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, and is maintained by epidemiologist Michele Marcus. \n\nMichigan Farmer magazine staff members Richard Lehnert and Bonnie Pollard broke the news of the contamination. The magazine continued coverage of the issue until the eventual bankruptcy proceedings of the farm cooperative responsible for the accidental contamination and subsequent distribution of the feed. These events were also portrayed in the 1981 documentary \"Cattlegate\" by Jeff Jackson, the true-fiction film \"Bitter Harvest\" starring Ron Howard, and in the book \"The Poisoning of Michigan\" by Joyce Egginton. A 1978 episode of \"Lou Grant\" (\"Slaughter\") portrays a similar, but fictionalized account. One year elapsed before the animals were culled. A study was undertaken on 4,545 people to determine the effects of PBBs on human beings. These include three exposure groups – all people who lived on the quarantined farms, people who received food from these farms and workers (and their families) engaged in PBB manufacture – as well as 725 people with low-level PBB exposure.\n\nAll were queried concerning 17 symptoms and conditions possibly related to PBBs. Venous blood was drawn and analyzed for PBB by gas chromatography. Mean serum PBB levels were found to be 26.9 ppb by weight (26.9 µg/kg) in farm residents, 17.1 in recipients, 43.0 ppb in workers, and 3.4 ppb in the low exposure group. No associations could be established between serum PBB levels and symptom prevalence rates.\n\nTo evaluate peripheral lymphocyte function, T and B cell quantitation and in vitro responses to three nonspecific mitogens were studied in 34 persons with highest PBB levels (mean: 787 ppb), and in 56 with low levels (mean: 2.8 ppb). Again, no statistically significant differences in lymphocyte function were noted.\n\nHowever, these studies are ongoing and adverse reproductive-system effects continue to be found in the grandchildren of those who consumed tainted farm products.\n\nNoting the possible hazards on the environment, however, PBBs were listed as one of six controlled substances under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS), which was enacted into European Law in February 2003. RoHS legislation lists PBBs as a \"restricted substance\" group. Other countries followed suit, resulting most recently in restriction dates instituted in China on March 1, 2007 and South Korea on July 1, 2007.\n\nUntil recently, testing for PBB has been cumbersome. Cycle time, inaccuracy, cost and level of expertise required for the test engineer have precluded the implementation of any screening of plastic components in a manufacturing or in a product qualification/validation environment.\n\nRecently, with the introduction of a new analytical instrument IA-Mass, screening of plastic material alongside the manufacturing line is possible. A 5 min. detection cycle and a 20 min. quantification cycle are available to test and to qualify plastic parts as they reach the assembly line.\n\n"}

Lee had also had his first experience in politics when he acted as an election agent for Laycock and his pro-British Singapore Progressive Party (SPP) in 1951.\n\nLaycock grew up in Manchester, England, and was an influential figure in the early development of rock climbing on the gritstone edges of the Peak District of Derbyshire along with his close friends Siegfried Herford, also of Manchester, and Stanley Jeffcoat of Buxton. In 1903 Laycock became a founder member of the Manchester-based Rucksack Club which included many other local climbing enthusiasts, including Charles Pilkington of the glass manufacturing dynasty. Laycock, Herford and Jeffcoat climbed numerous new routes on many of the fine escarpments of Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Yorkshire in the years leading up to the First World War, and these were faithfully recorded in Laycock's guidebook \"Some Gritstone Climbs\", the first published guidebook on rock climbing in the Peak District.\n\nThe Rucksack Club opposed the publication of the book as a number of the crags described were on private property and the club was concerned about trespass law. Laycock resigned from the club in disgust and the book was published by the Refuge Printing Department (an insurance company in Manchester at the time) in 1913. In the years that followed both Herford and Jeffcoat were killed in the trenches of Flanders, and Laycock never fully recovered from their loss. He left England for Singapore and, it is said, never went rock climbing again, although he wrote a preface to Fergus Graham's guidebook \"Recent Developments on Gritstone\" published in 1926.\n\nLaycock founded the Race Course Golf Club, Singapore's first truly multi-racial club, on 1 October 1924 at Farrer Park. The club served Asians who wanted to learn to play golf but could not join the exclusively European Royal Singapore Golf Club, and other avid golfers living around the Bukit Timah area. The Club lasted for three years, before it was evicted by the Turf Club land-owners who had sold the land.\n\nThus Laycock began searching for a new location for the golf club, and in 1929 found the perfect location in the MacRitchie catchment area. Laycock, then a Municipal Commissioner of Singapore, and his friends A.P. Rajah and Tan Chye Cheng, immediately submitted their plans for the new club for the locations, and received their stamp of approval at the General Committee Meeting of the Singapore Municipal Council on 28 June 1929. Design for the 18-hole course was done by Peter Robinson of Braid Hills, Edinburgh and the construction began on March 1930. Laycock and his grounds committee, with members such as Dr Harold Lim, supervised the entire project for the next two years. The new club was officially opened and renamed The Island Club on 27 August 1932, officiated by Sir Cecil Clementi, Governor of Singapore. Sir Chan Sze Jin CMG (S.J. Chan) became the club's first President, and Laycock took on the role as First Captain.\n\nLaycock died in Singapore on 3 December 1960 and was buried in Bidadari Cemetery. Tributes were sent to his son and daughters.\n"}

The text of Revelation states that John was on Patmos, a Greek island where, by most biblical historians, he is considered to be exiled as a result of anti-Christian persecution under the Roman emperor Domitian. \n\nSince the Roman era, Christians and historians have considered the Book of Revelation's writer to be the Apostle John (John the Evangelist), author of the Gospel of John. However, a minority of senior clerics and scholars, such as Eusebius (d. 339/340), recognize at least one further John as a companion of Jesus Christ, John the Presbyter \"after an interval, placing him among others outside of the number of the apostles\". Some Christian scholars since medieval times separate the disciple(s) from Revelation's writer, John of Patmos/the Divine.\n\nThe author of the Book of Revelation identifies himself only as \"John\". Traditionally, this was often believed to be the same person as John, son of Zebedee, one of the apostles of Jesus, to whom the Gospel of John was also attributed. The early-2nd-century writer, Justin Martyr, was the first to equate the author of Revelation with John the Evangelist. Other early Christian writers, however, such as Dionysius of Alexandria and Eusebius of Caesarea, noting the differences in language and theological outlook between this work and the Gospel, discounted this possibility, and argued for the exclusion of the Book of Revelation from the canon as a result. The early Christian writer Papias appeared in his writings to distinguish between John the Evangelist and John the Elder, and many biblical scholars now contend that the latter was the author of Revelation.\n\nJohn is considered to have been exiled to Patmos during a time of persecution under the Roman rule of Domitian in the late 1st century. states: \"I, John, both your brother and companion in tribulation...was on the island that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.\" Adela Yarbro Collins, a biblical scholar at Yale Divinity School, writes:\nEarly tradition says that John was banished to Patmos by the Roman authorities. This tradition is credible because banishment was a common punishment used during the Imperial period for a number of offenses. Among such offenses were the practices of magic and astrology. Prophecy was viewed by the Romans as belonging to the same category, whether Pagan, Jewish, or Christian. Prophecy with political implications, like that expressed by John in the Book of Revelation, would have been perceived as a threat to Roman political power and order. Three of the islands in the Sporades were places where political offenders were banished. (Pliny, \"Natural History\" 4.69–70; Tacitus, \"Annals\" 4.30)\n\nAccording to Tertullian (in \"The Prescription of Heretics\") John was banished after being plunged into boiling oil in Rome and suffering nothing from it.\n\n"}

On his father's plantation he acquired the industrious habits which characterized him through life. Though prevented by reason of his father's limited resources from attending school more than three months in the year, he made the most of his meager opportunities and soon found architecture was the passion of his youthful mind. He possessed exceptional talents for skillful and accurate designing, but his practical father considering that such an accomplishment was comparatively worthless, refused to encourage it, and so apprenticed his fourteen-year-old son to an indifferent sort of a jeweler who taught him the business of watch-making. \n\nIn the early 1840s, he came to Lumpkin, Georgia to clerk for Vermont-native William A. Rawson who married Root's sister in 1843. He did well but wanted larger opportunities. In the early summer of 1857 he came to Atlanta to co-partner a dry-goods business with Mr. J.N. Beach. In the autumn of that year, on the railroad from St. Louis to Chicago, he met with accident which broke his hand and arm in five places.\n\nIn the Spring of 1861, he decided to support secession over union. At the beginning of the American Civil War he helped organize the Board of Direct Trade to ensure Confederate trade to Europe was not disrupted. In this capacity he was sent to Europe but he returned home only to find his immense property interests destroyed by the Union and himself under arrest. As soon as he obtained his release he sold out his remaining fragments of real estate to Gov. Joseph E. Brown and went to New York, where he again established himself in business, maintaining connection with Liverpool and Charleston. He also helped establish the Mount Olivet Church at the request of freed southern negroes. He remained in New York until 1878 when he closed out his business in the metropolis and came to Atlanta. Back in Atlanta he continued his philanthropy work. He served as a trustee for Spellman Seminary, and through his association with Colonel Lemuel P. Grant, was given charge of constructing the L.P. Grant Park and being its Park Superintendent. \n\nFrom the date of his return until the time of his death he was one of its foremost citizens and when it was decided to hold the International Cotton Exposition in 1881, Mr. Root was commissioned to visit Europe in behalf of the enterprise where he successfully sold shares in the corporation.\n\nRoot was a great lover of nature and he suggested old colleague Lemuel Grant donate land to create a park. Soon after, in 1883, Root was named park commissioner by mayor John B. Goodwin in which office he was largely responsible for the construction of Grant Park. He served as chairman of the city's board of park commissioners for years, bringing to bear his artistic tastes as well as his ripe experience in beautifying what was then a resort at Grant Park. \n\nHis two sons were architects: John Wellborn Root, chief architect of the World Columbian Exposition and Walter Root in Kansas City.\n\nHe died on February 13, 1897 at his daughter's house in Atlanta.

{"id": "2023084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2023084", "title": "Electric pen", "text": "Electric pen\n\nThomas Edison's electric pen, part of a complete outfit for duplicating handwritten documents and drawings, was the first relatively safe electric-motor-driven office appliance produced and sold in the United States.\n\nEdison recognized the possible demand for a high speed copying device after observing the incredible amount of document duplication required of merchants, lawyers, insurance companies, and those of similar occupations. To satisfy this demand, Edison invented the electric pen, which uses a perforating function inspired by the printing telegraph. Edison and his associate Charles Batchelor observed that as this device punctured the paper, a mark was left underneath by the chemical solution it utilized. Edison took advantage of this property and built the electric pen around it.\nDevelopment of the electric pen took place in the summer of 1875. US patent 1800,857 for autographic printing was issued to Thomas Edison in 1876, covering the pen, the duplication press, and accessories.\n\nThe electric pen was the key component of a complete duplicating system, which included the pen, a cast-iron holder with a wooden insert, a wet cell battery on a cast-iron stand, and a cast-iron flatbed duplicating press with ink roller. All the cast-iron parts were black japanned, with gold striping or decoration. The hand-held electric pen was powered by a wet cell battery, which was wired to an electric motor mounted on top of a pen-like shaft. The motor drove a reciprocating needle which, according to the manual, could make 50 punctures per second, or 3,000 per minute. The user was instructed to place the stencil on firm blotting paper on a flat surface, then use the pen to write or draw naturally to form words and designs as a series of minute perforations in the stencil.\n\nOnce the stencil was prepared, it was placed in the flatbed duplicating press with a blank sheet of paper below. An inked roller was passed over the stencil, leaving an impression of the image on the paper. Edison boasted that over 5,000 copies could be made from one stencil.\n\nEdison’s main target audience included firms that depended on the duplication of documents to run their business. To drive demand, Edison advertised in a circular that was written by the pen itself, in which the pen was called “the “Electro-Autographic Press” and was said to be “the only process yet invented whereby an unlimited number of impressions can be taken with rapidity from ordinary manuscript.” Another advertisement made by the pen read “Like Kissing--Every Succeeding Impression is as Good as the First--Endorsed By Every One Who Has Tried It!--Only a Gentle Pressure Used.” with the words floating around an embracing couple.\n\nAside from companies, the electric pen was also marketed to the general public, with other uses for the invention being personal letters, pamphlets, music, contracts, circulars, and architectural and mechanical drawings among other types of documents. In late 1875, the pen was at first sold only in the East Coast of the United States at the starting price of $30. It was further spread to the Midwest, British Columbia, and England after its rise in popularity, when more than 150 pens were being sold monthly. The market continued to expand to Cuba and South America, with Europe and Asia being added by 1877. However, by 1880, the business for the electric pen started to decline when other inventions that were more efficient soon overtook Edison’s product in the market, causing it to eventually fall into obscurity. It is said that roughly 60,000 pens were sold throughout its commercial lifespan in total; however, this number is likely to be made up by Edison in order to give the product more publicity.\n\nThe major drawback to Edison’s electric pen was its wet cell battery, which had to be taken care of and maintained by experienced telegraphists. Due to its messy nature, it was important for Edison to incorporate batteries that were more acceptable to clerks who had to take care of the pen and its underlying machinery. Otherwise, the bankers and insurance people may never take interest in it, as said by Mullarkey, an ex-telegraph operator and New York agent for Edison.\n\nThe need for batteries in the electric pen ultimately caused its steady decline, as mechanical pens that did not require batteries to operate took over the market by 1880. These pens, along with other cheaper and simpler stencil-making technologies quickly became more popular and widely used, until all were eventually overtaken by the typewriter by the late 1880s.\n\nEdison started selling the rights to manufacture and market the pens as early as the end of 1876, but it was not until the mid-1880s that the A.B. Dick Company finally ended up with the rights and patent to the invention. The Chicago manufacturer went on to create the mimeograph, an electric pen spin-off marketed specifically as \"Edison’s Mimeograph\" under his permission. Unlike the electric pen, the mimeograph sold with relative success, and the A.B. Dick Company remained in business until 2004.\n\nAfter its usefulness as a writing implement had ended, the electric pen was adapted to fulfill an entirely different role. In 1891, a New York City tattoo artist Samuel O’Reilly repurposed the electric pen’s design to be used as the first electric tattoo needle. What was previously done by hand was now done at a much faster pace thanks to this revolutionary device. Around this time, tattoos were starting to rise as a cultural phenomenon thanks to their popularity among European nobility. O’Reilly took advantage of this and produced an electric tattoo needle to give him the edge in this new market. O’Reilly enjoyed considerable success until his abrupt death in 1908. Charles Wagner, O’Reilly’s apprentice, inherited the business from his master.\n\nAn October 2015 episode of \"History\" program \"American Pickers\" finds a European version Electric Pen in a private Wisconsin collection of early electric devices. The owner says recent auctions have seen other examples sell for between $15,000 and $20,000 USD This particular Electric Pen also includes a very rare battery box. The owner sells the Pen to the Pickers for $12,000, which they expect to resell at a higher price.\n\n\n"}

In 1981, \"Games\" introduced The Games 100 Contest, which involved identifying pieces from games listed in the Games 100, with the grand prize being more than half of the games on that list. \"Games\" continues to publish this list as \"The Buyers Guide to Games\", broken out into \"The Traditional Games 100\" and \"The Electronic Games 100\".\n\nLists are published in either the November or December issue. Through 1994, the lists for a year were published at the end of that year. Starting in 1995, lists are released at the end of the year prior to the year of the list. (This means that there was no list for 1995. There was also no list for 1990, because \"Games\" was temporarily out of publication during the period when the list would have been published.) There are several categories for which \"best\" games are determined.\n\nThe winner of the historical category for approximately the last ten years has been determined by one individual, Walt O'Hara, who runs the Historicon miniatures convention.\n\nPart of the Buyer's Guide includes a hall of fame for \"games that have met or exceeded the highest standards of quality and play value and have been continuously in production for at least 10 years; i.e., classics.\"\n\nThis Hall of Fame includes:\n\n"}

{"id": "2023157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2023157", "title": "Lutheran Church of Australia", "text": "Lutheran Church of Australia\n\nThe Lutheran Church of Australia (LCA) is the major Lutheran denomination in Australia and New Zealand. It counts 540 congregations and 48,760 members according to official statistics.\n\nThe first Lutherans to come to Australia in any significant number were the immigrants from Prussia, who arrived in 1838 with Pastor August Kavel. This period in Prussia was marked by a persecution of \"Old Lutherans\" who refused to join the Prussian Union, under King Frederick Wilhelm.\n\nIn 1841, a second wave of Prussian immigrants started, with the arrival of Pastor Gotthard Fritzsche. He settled with the migrants in his group in Lobethal and Bethanien (now Bethany) in South Australia. The Lutheran church of this period is referred to as the Kavel-Fritzsche Synod.\n\nA split occurred within the South Australian Lutheran community in 1846, and two separate synods were established. The followers of Kavel founded the Langmeil-Light Pass Synod, and those of Fritzsche the Bethany-Lobethal Synod.\n\nThese two groups came eventually to be named the \"Evangelical Lutheran Church in Australia\", which derived from the Bethany-Lobethal Synod, and the \"United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Australia\" which was of the Langmeil-Light Pass Synod, and a number of other synods that had developed. These two denominations joined to form the \"Lutheran Church of Australia\" in 1966.\n\nA significant influx occurred after World War II and migration also brought a number of Lutherans from other European countries.\n\nLutherans set up missions in Aboriginal communities. Noel Pearson, for instance, was raised in such an environment.\n\nAs of 2009, the church had 320 parishes, 540 and 70,000 baptised members in Australia and 1,130 baptised members in New Zealand.\n\n\"Government censuses indicate that about 250,000 Australians and New Zealanders identify as Lutheran. In practice, though, the Lutheran Church of Australia (LCA), which includes the Lutheran Church of New Zealand (LCNZ), is a relatively small Christian denomination, with about 60,000 regular worshippers. By contrast, the worldwide Lutheran Church, with just over 70 million adherents, is the second largest non-Catholic church (and largest Protestant church) in the world.\"\n\n\"The LCA is 'synodical' church, meaning that every congregation 'walks together' with every other congregation, every district with every other district, and every department or agency with every other one... [However] every congregation is... unique... So, while all congregations adhere to the LCA constitution, they are free to exercise their own interpretations of the LCA's mission and ministry objectives.\"\n\nEvery three years representatives of the LCA's congregations meet for a Synod meeting. Pastors provide input regarding theological matters, but in effect it is the people in the pews, rather than church leaders, who determine the direction of [the] church.\"\n\nAccording to the church, \"Our logo represents how we see ourselves as two nations under the Southern Cross, created by God, redeemed by Jesus Christ and empowered by the Holy Spirit to serve the people of our two nations and the world.\"\n\nThe church's tagline is \"Where Love Comes to Life\", which congregants believe \"reflects the heart and soul of [their] mission.\"\n\nThe official hymn book of the Lutheran Church of Australia is the Lutheran Hymnal with Supplement.\n\nThe church is happy to use gender-inclusive language where this does not detract from the teachings of the Word of God and to this end, the church is happy to modernise the language of its hymns where such modernisation is practical.\n\nIn comparison to the Lutheran synods in Europe, the Lutheran Church of Australia as of 2012 remains a strongly confessional church. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, there was the early influence of the Old Lutherans and, secondly, \"from the 1880s the church sought pastors from the US (Missouri Synod).\" The influence of these American Lutherans caused the LCA to deviate from the doctrines of the more mainstream (or, indeed, liberal) European Lutherans. As the academic Robert Putnam states, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod is \"the most conservative Christian denomination in America\".\n\nThe church is happy to support the Australian Christian Lobby where such an emphasis is supportive of the teachings of the Word of God.\n\nAs it grapples with the issue of how it should modernise yet stay faithful to Christ's teachings, the church is experiencing declining membership across Australia. According to the 2011 Australian census, there are now more Hindus than Lutherans in Australia.\n\nThe LCA very much believes that the Bible is the primary source of revelation and instruction for Christians. This Lutheran doctrine is known as sola scriptura. According to this doctrine, though revelation through experience is of importance, it does not prevail over sola scriptura.\n\nThe church \"adhere[s] to the three ecumenical (or universal) creeds of Christians around the world.\" It also \"subscribes to the central teachings (or confessions) of Lutherans worldwide.\"\n\nThe church advocates film censorship, stating that \"X-rated and violent videos are an assault on God's gifts; they pervert his gift of sexuality, and deny the dignity of human beings.\" The church rejects the idea that the definition of what is pornographic may be subjective and differ from audience to audience. To the contrary, the church feels that, \"The trite comment, 'Evil is in the eye of the beholder', does not take seriously the evil in all people, including those who profit from the exploitation of men, women and children who are used in the production of this material. It also ignores the addictive and controlling influence of X-rated and violent videos.\"\n\nLike historical Christianity, the LCA holds to conservative views on sex. Although it does not oppose contraception, overall it feels \"that normally married couples should have children ... Nowhere in Scripture, however, is there any indication that married couples should produce offspring to the extent of their biological maximum. Nor has the church ever taught this [but] all avoidance of parenthood for selfish reasons, such as unwillingness to assume the responsibilities and sacrifices of bearing and rearing children, is opposed to the will of God. They warn especially against a self-indulgent use of contraceptives.\"\n\nThe church continues to hold a sacred view of marriage and believes that sexual relations belong within the marriage relationship. The church believes that pre-marital sex is in \"violation of the will of God. The wide use of contraceptives has aided the general decline in sexual morality.\"\n\nThe Lutheran Church of Australia's \"Statement on Homosexuality\" was adopted by the General Synod, 1975 Convention. It contains the following paragraphs.\n\n\"God's Word is silent about homosexuality as a propensity. In view of this and in the light of medical, and psychological evidence, the Church may not condemn or judge homosexual propensity. It is part of the mysterious disturbance and distortion that has entered God’s creation and his created social structures. Like disease, it must be seen in the context of the Fall and the resultant intrusion of disruptive and abnormal forces which have upset and perverted God's original design.\"\n\n\"God’s word regards this disruption and perversion as a judgement of God on the whole of humanity so that in this sense all people are somehow involved.\"\n\nThe Church and the Homosexual\n\"As in the case of pain and disease, the Christian homosexual should accept his homosexual propensity in obedience to God, bear his cross bravely, seek all possible professional help and pastoral aid, and in faith resist the strong temptation of rebelling and murmuring against God\"\n\nTreatment\n\"Skilled counselling may be helpful, particularly to the young (under 35 years of age).\"\n\"Hormone treatment will not change the direction of the sexual drive, although it may lessen its intensity.\"\n\n\"Punishment does not result in change of propensity, although it may restrict overt behaviour.\" \n\nThe regular Convention of the LCA in 2013 was presented with an interim paper entitled \"Human Sexuality: Key Issues today.\" \nA larger paper was presented to the General Pastors’ Conference for discussion and comment. These papers are a stage along the way to producing a statement on human sexuality, as the Church re-examines, explains and applies its teaching pastorally. The new statement \nwill also replace the LCA’s 1975 statement on homosexuality. (pg 283ff)\n\nLike many Protestant churches, the LCA \"does not condemn nor judge homosexuality and claims the Bible is silent on homosexual orientation. Homosexuals are welcomed into the congregation.\"\n\nOne of the issues currently before the synod is that of the ordination of women as pastors. At present women can serve as lay readers in special circumstances, assist at the distribution of Holy Communion, but not as pastors. This is in contrast to more recent German and Scandinavian Lutheranism, where women have been able to serve as both pastors and bishops.\n\nThe church also rejects new translations of the Bible and liturgy that use inclusive language in reference to God. Rather, the church feels that (with regard to calling God \"the Father\"), \"The language which we use for God is not merely metaphorical or picture language. Our language for God involves the actual nature of God as revealed to us in Christ. The God who is revealed to humanity in the holy Scriptures is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, three persons in the one Godhead... [However]... When the writers of the holy Scriptures speak of God, they use a wide range of images, metaphors, and symbols to describe what God is like or how God regards and deals with Israel and the human race. Included in these various images and symbols is the use of maternal imagery.\"\n\nThe LCA believes in the separation of church and state: \"The church has been charged with only one commission by its risen and ascended Lord: to preach the gospel of the forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation to a lost and dying world... Only harm can result if the different roles of church and state, different but also complementary, are not observed and kept distinct. Confusion of the two leads directly to various evils: either church or state becomes an oppressive power, or both do; the church loses its reason for existence...\"\n\nFurthermore, the LCA acknowledges \"The church as such has no special power to legislate on any political question or problem. Nor has it the right to endeavour to exert political pressure, for instance, by forming a political party or by lobbying or by instructing its members how they must vote in political elections or referendums. Its members must act together with all members of society to do what is possible in each political case on the basis of what reason suggests and the power available permits. The church as such can and should, of course, point quite distinctly to the will of God (the Law) to which all people, including all those in authority, should be obedient...\"\n\n\"This basic principle... holds also in respect of social problems. Some of these involve the moral law and the church must not fail to bear witness to God's will where that will is quite plain. Many other social problems call for the exercise of love. In these the church as a corporate body, and not only through its members, can and should act when emergencies are there and when society as a whole in any particular place is unaware of the problem or incapable of action in relation to it. Examples of such action are church activities in providing education or health services and medical care, or poor relief in backward or temporarily disorganised and helpless areas. This work may become unnecessary as society becomes more aware of, or more capable of meeting, its responsibilities, and as a whole does what the church has previously done in a vicarious capacity.\"\nGerman Australian culture is deeply pacifist. Indeed, many Germans came to Australia to escape militarism. As evidence of this, there is a memorial to Bertha von Suttner in Wagga Wagga. Reflecting this, \"The church... accepts the validity of a person's refusal to engage in military service if he or she is convinced that participation in a military conflict amounts to the transgression of God's commandment 'You shall not kill'... The church maintains that warfare which potentially and actually involves the mass destruction of human beings is never justified.\" The story of German anti-Nazi pacifist Sophie Scholl is frequently taught in Australian Lutheran schools.\n\nFurthermore, \"The church lives in a fallen, sinful world in rebellion against God's laws and institutions, against his will and ordinances. It 'carries the burdens of others' (cf Gal 6:2), especially of people oppressed and suffering injustice inflicted on them by those who, instead of justice, exercise brutal power. With the prophets and apostles, it proclaims God's judgment against those who do such evil... The church realises that, in a conflict-ridden world, wars are initiated as a result of greed, rivalry, suspicion, lust for power, etc. Against such evils and their disastrous consequences, the church raises its warning and pleading voice... The church views with deep concern and sadness the enormous build-up of nuclear and other destructive armaments in the world today... The escalation of weapon systems and their possible use create anxiety, fear, and unrest throughout the world, and pose a real threat to present and future generations and their natural habitat... The church pleads with governments and the citizens of their countries to embark on nuclear disarmament. It cannot under any circumstances support either wars of mass destruction or armed conflicts which violate the mandate of peace and the principles of justice. The church denounces the use of financial resources required for help in the existing areas of global human need (eg hunger, homelessness, disease, and poverty) for the manufacture and deployment of weapons of mass destruction... The church supports legislation which recognises the validity of conscientious objection of citizens...\"\n\nDespite their avowed pacifism and belief in the separation of church and state, the LCA still sponsors military chaplains.\n\nIn theory, the LCA is outspoken when it comes to issues such as opposing warfare. Officially, it has stated that it must give \"witness to governments about its commitment to the word of God and to prayer for peace. It will inform the authorities of its views on relevant legislative and political decisions, socio-moral issues, ethical concerns, economic circumstances, and other matters which affect the well-being and security of the people. The church cannot afford to be silent in the face of mounting armaments and increasing national and international tensions; to do so would be to fail in its obligation to help prevent mass destruction and to minimise global conflict.\"\n\nHowever, the LCA has some reservations when it comes to deciding how much attention it should give to other social justice issues. Indeed, some members are concerned that \"Full membership [of the Lutheran World Federation] could lead us down the path of social activism since some LWF churches seem to care more about social justice than justification by faith.\"\n\nOther LCA congregants look on this differently, feeling that \"The LWF will help us become more conscious of the social implications of the gospel and provide opportunities to work in partnership with other Lutherans in addressing questions of international significance.\"\n\nDespite its reservations on speaking out extensively on issues, the LCA does recognise Social Justice Sunday.\n\nAlso, in the past the church has been prepared to join the other major Christian denominations in protesting against Queensland's culture of political corruption, even when the then-premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, was himself of Lutheran heritage. Indeed, \"As Bjelke-Petersen's premiership progressed there emerged from religious sources, and on religious grounds, some resistance to the policies Bjelke-Petersen and his administration were pursuing. The ban on street marching, the assault on indigenous missions and the SEQEB industrial dispute all precipitated strenuous opposition from mainstream churches, particularly the Catholic, Anglican and Uniting. Even the Queensland president of the Lutheran Church, Bjelke-Petersen's denomination, more than once took his place alongside leaders of the other three major churches at press conferences, criticising actions or policies of the State Government.\"\n\n\"The inspiration for this development of Church taking on the State was the Confessing Church in 1930s Germany, the Second Vatican Council, church involvement in the US civil rights movement, and new theological movements such as feminist, black and liberation theology which gathered momentum through the 1960s and 70s.\"\n\nThe church rejects the notion of human rights: \"The word of God nowhere declares that human beings have fundamental rights which they can claim or secure or extend. Nowhere does the Bible mention the concept of human rights or its equivalent; nowhere does it refer to sacred, inviolable, immutable rights which are based in human nature as such. Nowhere are they considered as direct realisations of the will of God. They are not a divine law, not eternal truths. [However] the contribution of Christian theology to the secular concern for human rights will be critical assessment and elucidation so that that concern may acquire a basic direction which corresponds to, or is parallel to, Christian ethics.\"\n\nIn contrast to nearly all mainstream Protestant denominations, including the Anglican and Uniting Churches, the Lutheran Church does not emphatically reject capital punishment. Rather, it states that \"because of the lack of a clear biblical directive, the church can only say that capital punishment is not contrary to the will of God, but is not demanded by God... Nevertheless, the church should not cease its witness to the sanctity of human life and demand punishment for those who commit murder. At the same time the church should encourage the state to develop clear and plausible concepts of the reason, meaning and purpose of the punishments which by law it determines for crimes that have been committed.\" However, a way to administer capital punishment objectively is out of reach from mankind as a whole. Therefore, Lutherans believe that it should not be administered. As it says in the book of Romans chapter 12 verse 19 \"Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say, \"I will take revenge; I will pay them back,\" says the LORD.\"\n\nOn the issue of abortion, the Lutheran Church of Australia is basically pro-life. However, it \"recognises that there are circumstances under which a termination of pregnancy may properly be considered, namely, when competent medical people are of the opinion that the life of the mother can be saved only by terminating the pregnancy. In such a case, it is a question, humanly speaking, of choosing between one human life and another. A choice cannot be avoided. Before choosing to abort the child the mother should, if possible, seek both medical and pastoral guidance... There are other special cases -- for example, pregnancies which result from incest, rape, or other perverted sexual relationships -- and special problems with which parents and members of the medical and nursing profession have to wrestle. These special cases and situations must always be evaluated and decided in the light of the basic principle that the fetus is human life created by God... The Lutheran Church firmly believes that hospital authorities should respect the conscientious objections of medical and nursing personnel to the performing of abortions.\"\n\nHistorically, Lutherans from Martin Luther onwards thought that the office of the pope was the Antichrist. The Lutheran Church of Australia tends to be more conciliatory: \"The Lutheran Church of Australia cannot continue to affirm at this time that the Roman papacy bears the distinguishing features of the Antichrist. We dialogue with Roman Catholics as with brothers and sisters in the faith; we certainly do not regard them as people under the authority and spirit of Antichrist.\"\n\nHowever, \"the papacy still presents formidable problems for Lutherans. The Pope continues to see himself as the vicar of Christ, claiming the right and power to represent the whole church as Christ’s supreme representative. Although papal infallibility is now limited by provisos, it is still maintained.\"\n\nThe church does not believe that prayers to the dead are in order and therefore it dissuades the practice. It believes that prayers should be directed to God instead, though one can be thankful for the life of a deceased person.\n\nWith regard to saints, the church feels that \"departed saints can provide us with examples of how to live the Christian life. We can certainly honour and acknowledge them in our prayer life, but we do not look to them for help or to answer our prayers. Jesus is our one mediator to God the Father.\"\n\nThe church believes God created the world but has not made a theological statement as to how. It accepts the basic biblical narratives and poems of creation, which emphasise that human beings are created in the image of God and not by some form of evolvement aside from the Creator and from other species.\n\n\"Dialogue, as the Lutheran Church of Australia (LCA) understands the term, is official and authorised conversations with churches which are not in altar and pulpit fellowship with the LCA. The conversations concern matters of faith, doctrine, and practice. The purpose of dialogues may vary from time to time. The basic aim is that the truth, as confessed and practised by the LCA, is brought to bear on matters of faith and life in the context of dialogue... All genuine dialogue will be conducted ‘in view of eternity’ and with the firm belief that in such conversations the truth will prevail for the welfare of the church and the glory of the Lord of the one holy catholic church.\"\n\n\"Traditionally, the LCA has taken as its starting point for fellowship with other churches agreement in the doctrine of the gospel and the sacraments. Doctrine has come first. Increasingly, Lutherans and others are starting from the ancient church’s understanding of communio, which grounds communion among Christians as well as among churches in the mutual communion between the Father, his Son, and their Spirit. The church as the icon of the Trinity finds the source and goal of its own life in its participation in the life of the divine Trinity. The mutual love between the persons of the Trinity also permeates and forms the communion (koinonia) of the church on earth, which is both proclaimed and enacted in the eucharist... The unity that we share through our common life in the triune God is grounded in baptism and confirmed and strengthened in the Lord’s supper. All who are united with Christ by baptism and faith are made one body with him as they eat.. the Lord’s supper... The unity of all believers is a gift of the triune God. God draws us into communion with himself through the gospel and the holy sacraments.\"\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards, there has been much more dialogue with other mainstream Christian denominations. The Church states that \"Our commitment to dialogue with the Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Uniting churches reflects a growing conviction that our ecumenical engagement is not an optional extra but is central to what it means to be a church in the world.\"\n\nIn 2001, the Anglican and Lutheran churches jointly produced a document entitled \"Covenanting for Mutual Recognition and Reconciliation between the Anglican Church of Australia and the Lutheran Church in Australia\" in order to further this aim.\n\nHowever, despite these movements towards greater openness to others, the church is still only an affiliate member of the Lutheran World Federation because of concerns that \"Our Lutheran confessional identity may be eroded because many LWF member churches are not as strongly confessional as the LCA [and] some LWF member churches (like the ELCA in America) have entered into communion with non-Lutheran churches whose doctrinal position is not in agreement with the Lutheran confessions [and that the] LWF could pressure us into practices that are not in keeping with our confessional position.\"\n\nAlthough the church advocates multiculturalism, it does not endorse religious pluralism.\n\nThe first Lutheran school in Australia opened in 1839. Today, there are twenty-seven Lutheran-run primary and secondary schools in Queensland, thirty-three in South Australia and sixteen in Victoria, with a much smaller number in each of the other states and territories. The body overseeing these is Lutheran Education Australia, which has a branch in each State.\n\nThere has been a very significant growth in Lutheran school enrolments over the last twenty-five years and particularly in the last decade. As of August 2011, 37 313 Australian children attended Lutheran schools, with another 3 600 in early childhood centres. At this time, there were 3 249 teachers employed at Lutheran schools around Australia.\n\n\"The church acknowledges that parents have the first responsibility for the education of their children. Through its schools, therefore, the church seeks to support parents in the fulfilment\nof this responsibility to their children. Furthermore, the church, through its schools, offers to all parents the option of a Christian education for their children... The church urges and encourages schools and local congregations to work together in worship and mission in the world of the school.\"\n\nThe LCA has stated that \"The church acknowledges that the state has accepted responsibility for providing schooling for all its citizens. This education is compulsory, free, and secular in its orientation... The church further acknowledges that the government permits non-government authorities, such as the churches, to operate schools, provided that they meet certain government- determined criteria, such as curriculum and health and safety requirements. The church will continue to own and operate its schools in accordance with government requirements, provided that meeting these requirements does not bring the church into conflict with the word of God and the teachings of the church. The church will continue to accept financial assistance from the government under conditions determined by the government from time to time, provided that the teachings of the church are in no way or at any time compromised.\"\n\nThe LCA feels that \"The church is present in the Lutheran school as staff, parents, and students are gathered by the gospel and nurtured by word and sacrament. This community of the faithful will be active in all the functions of the church, namely worship, nurture, fellowship, witness, and service... public ministry is ‘public, foundational, and ecumenical, since it is by the public proclamation of the gospel and the public administration of the sacraments the Holy Spirit creates, upholds, and extends the church throughout the world’. Accordingly, if the gospel is to inform the Lutheran school, the public ministry needs to be present...\"\n\nHence, \"In order to fulfil this ministry and mission, teachers in the Lutheran school will not only be qualified and competent educators. They will also\n\n\nThe \"schools seek to nurture integrated individuals, who\n\n\n\"Lutheran schools see each student as unique and offer an education program that will allow each student to develop their God-given abilities as fully as possible, providing programs for students with disabilities as well as those assessed as gifted and talented.\"\n\nThere are also Lutheran school programs for indigenous and rural and remote students.\n\nThe Australian Lutheran College, based in Adelaide, offers theological and teacher education.\n\nThe church states that \"We Lutherans believe that we are called to love people as Christ loved us - and that doesn't mean only those people who are members of our church. Wherever we are able, we gladly extend our loving care to anyone who might need us, including those who are elderly, disabled or disadvantaged in any way. Increasingly we are offering a helping hand also to indigenous people, and refugees and new arrivals. We believe the words of Jesus, who said that when we reach out in love and care to someone else, we do it for him (Matthew 25:37.)\"\n\nThe LCA provides pastoral care for the following groups in particular:\n\n\nThe Church also runs an operation to provide food as a way of bonding communities. Indeed, it feels that this aspect of charity is one of its strengths. They state that \"Hospitality involving food is something Lutherans have always been good at. It’s indigenous to who we are.

It is doubtful, however, whether merger applies except where the substituted contract is one of a higher nature, as where a contract under seal supersedes a simple contract. Where one contract is replaced by another, it is of course necessary that the new contract should be a valid contract, founded upon sufficient consideration (see Contract). The extinction of the previous contract is sufficient consideration. The question whether there is a novation most frequently arises in the course of dealing between a customer and a new partnership, and on the assignment of the business of a life assurance company with reference to the assent of the policyholders to the transfer of their policies. The points on which novation turns are whether the new firm or company has assumed the liability of the old, and whether, the creditor has consented to accept the liability of the new debtors and discharge the old. The question is one of fact in each case. See especially the Life Assurance Companies Act 1872, s. 7, where the word \"novations\" occurs in the marginal note to the section, and so has quasi-statutory sanction.\n\nScottish law seems to be more stringent than English law in the application of the doctrine of novation, and to need stronger evidence of the creditor's consent to the transfer of liability.\n\nIn American law, as in English, the term is something of a novelty, except in Louisiana, where much of the civil law is retain.\n\nIn contrast to an assignment, which is generally valid as long as the other party is given notice (except where the obligation is specific to the obligor, as in a personal service contract with a specific ballet dancer, or where assignment would place a new and special burden on the counterparty), a novation is valid only with the consent of all parties to the original agreement. A contract transferred by the novation process transfers all duties and obligations from the original obligor to the new obligor.\n\nFor example, if there exists a contract whereby Dan will give a TV to Alex, and another contract whereby Alex will give a TV to Becky, then, it is possible to novate both contracts and replace them with a single contract wherein Dan agrees to give a TV to Becky. In contrast to assignment, novation requires the consent of all parties. Consideration is still required for the new contract, but it is usually assumed to be the discharge of the former contract.\n\nAnother classic example is when Company A enters a contract with Company B and a novation is included to ensure that if Company B sells, merges or transfers the core of their business to another company, the new company assumes the obligations and liabilities that Company B has with Company A under the contract. So in terms of the contract, a purchaser, merging party or transferee of Company B steps into the shoes of Company B with respect to its obligations to Company A. Alternatively, a \"novation agreement\" may be signed after the original contract in the event of such a change. This is common in contracts with governmental entities; an example being under the United States Anti-Assignment Act, the governmental entity that originally issued the contract must agree to such a transfer or it is automatically invalid by law.\n\nThe criteria for novation comprise the obligee's acceptance of the new obligor, the new obligor's acceptance of the liability, and the old obligor's acceptance of the new contract as full performance of the old contract. Novation is not a unilateral contract mechanism, hence allows room for negotiation on the new T&Cs under the new circumstances. Thus, 'acceptance of the new contract as full performance of the old contract' may be read in conjunction to the phenomenon of 'mutual agreement of the T&Cs'.\n\nNovation is also used in futures and options trading to describe a special situation where the central clearing house interposes itself between buyers and sellers as a legal counter party, i.e., the clearing house becomes buyer to every seller and vice versa. This obviates the need for ascertaining credit-worthiness of each counter party and the only credit risk that the participants face is the risk of the clearing house defaulting. In this context, novation is considered a form of risk management.\n\nThe term is also used in markets that lack a centralized clearing system, such as swap trading and certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, where \"novation\" refers to the process where one party to a contract may assign its role to another, who is described as \"stepping into\" the contract. This is analogous to selling a future contract.\n\nNovation is a rare means of acquiring title in international law. Examples include Orkney and the Shetland Islands, which were pledged to Scotland by the King of Norway in lieu of a debt in 1468. They were annexed by Scotland in 1472; Corsica, which was only pledged to France by Genoa in a treaty of 1768; and Belize, which was originally only a grant of logging rights to the British by Spain in the Treaty of Paris (1763). Some cases, like that of Belize, remain controversial.\n\n"}

When non-group members, or outsiders, are considered or potentially labeled as less valuable without basis for stated group-supported and group-reinforced prejudice, group members may have a tendency to then consider themselves as intellectually superior, which can limit alternate points of view, thus becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy in which group members automatically begin to devalue others and the intellect of others that are separate from their group, without logical rationale for doing so.

They were identified in this manner because the Congressional redistricting plan passed by the Texas legislature for the 2004 elections forced these five Democrats out of their previous districts and into ones dominated by Republicans and/or occupied by Republican incumbents. The five Democrats were Martin Frost, Charles Stenholm, Max Sandlin, Nick Lampson, and Chet Edwards. Four Democrats lost their bids for reelection. Only Edwards survived the redistricting, but was eventually defeated by a Republican in 2010. The races were especially notable for their extreme cost. Martin Frost's race against a Republican incumbent, Pete Sessions, was the most expensive U.S. House race in the 2004 elections. The four defeated Democrats had a combined 68 years of experience in the House of Representatives.\n\nSome consider the plan that ousted four of the Texas Five a prime example of gerrymandering. Naturally, a redistricting plan that put five long-time incumbents in trouble was controversial. Representative Tom DeLay was responsible for the plan, which he forced through the Texas Legislature after two walkouts by Texas Democrats. DeLay has since been accused of wrongdoing for using the Federal Aviation Administration to force the Democrats back into session in Texas to vote on the redistricting, as well as for helping fund several Republican candidates for the state legislature in 2002. Republicans took the majority in the state legislature in 2002. In October 2004, the United States Supreme Court ordered a lower court to review the redistricting plan to determine whether or not it was unduly partisan and unfair to Texas voters. The Circuit Court upheld the districts but it went back to the Supreme Court, which in \"League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry\" dismissed the statewide claims of partisan gerrymandering (7-2), in large part because the Court found the districts drawn in 1991, largely by Frost to be just as partisan. However, the Supreme Court also ruled 5-4 that District 23 was a racial gerrymander in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nSee 2003 Texas redistricting for information on the Democratic walkouts from the Texas legislature to Oklahoma and the resulting controversy.\n"}

The group reportedly rehearsed for less than a month before playing in concert. They released a semi-live album, recorded during two live performances at The Warfield in San Francisco, entitled \"Through the Fire\". The album includes a cover of Procol Harum's \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\".\n\nAfter the release of Journey's \"Frontiers\" in early 1983, guitarist Neal Schon decided to pursue another project with vocalist/guitarist Sammy Hagar. Hagar had released his \"Three Lock Box\" album in late 1982 and afterwards took a three-month safari vacation in Africa. Schon and Hagar then began looking for other musicians to complete the band. In an interview from mid-1983, Schon talked about the band's formation: \"Sammy and I just get along so well. We're already working on an album together, and it's a killer! Right now we have Denny Carmassi, who used to work with Sammy on drums, and we're looking for a bassist. We worked a bit with Tom Petersson, but I guess he had other commitments.\"\n\nSchon went on the \"Frontiers\" tour with Journey from February to September 1983, and then reconvened with Hagar. By this time, Carmassi had also left and the remaining two band members became Kenny Aaronson on bass and Michael Shrieve on drums. Shrieve and Schon had played together in Santana in the early 1970s.\n\nTo record their album, the band played live dates from November 9, 1983 to November 21, 1983 at the Warfield Theatre. Two of the dates, November 14 and November 15 in San Francisco, California were recorded and broadcast by MTV. This footage was aired at least once but was never released on official videotapes or DVDs. The album \"Through the Fire\" was edited in-studio to reduce the crowd noise, but otherwise was left as recorded.\n\nA full concert of the band was also aired on the radio as a Westwood One broadcast. The original tracks that did not make the album include: \"Movin' In for the Kill\", \"Tough Enough\", \"Through the Eyes of Love\", \"Hope and Fear\", \"Since You Came\", and \"What Will Never Be\".\n\nThe first single released was their cover version of \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" in May 1984, which reached No. 94 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 charts. Another single released, \"Top of the Rock\" (as a promo only,) peaked at #15 on the \"Billboard\" Top Rock Tracks, and it became popular in various airplay regions of the United States. In addition, a third single from H.S.A.S., \"Missing You\" (also promo only,) peaked at #37 on the Top Rock Tracks.\n\nThe band toured briefly in California in 1984, adding rhythm guitarist Nick Sciorsci for live performances.\n\nHSAS only produced one album before Schon returned to Journey, and Hagar recorded his \"VOA\" album and subsequently joined Van Halen.

For the most part, these locomotives are built to serve regional, niche markets with a very specific purpose.\n\nElectro-diesel locomotives are used to provide continuous journeys along routes that are only partly electrified without a change of locomotive, avoid extensive running of \"diesel under the wires\" (using a diesel locomotive where electrified lines are available), and giving solution where diesel engines are banned. They may be designed or adapted mainly for electric use, mainly for diesel use or to work well as either electric or diesel.\n\nNote that, as well as the electric multiple unit (EMU) and diesel multiple unit (DMU), where no discrete locomotive is present, even electro-diesel multiple units (BMU) exist. \n\nThis is effectively an electric locomotive with a relatively small auxiliary diesel prime mover intended only for low-speed or short-distance operation (e.g. British Rail Class 73). Some of these, such as the British Rail Class 74, were converted from electric locomotives. The Southern Region of British Railways used these locomotives to cross non-electrified gaps and to haul boat trains that used tramways at the ports of Southampton and Weymouth. For economy, the diesel engine and its generator are considerably smaller than the electric capacity. The Southern types were of 1,600 hp or 'Type 3' rating as electrics, but only 600 hp as diesels. Later classes had as much as 2,500 hp on electric power, but still the same diesel engines. Despite this large difference, their comparable tractive efforts were much closer (around three-quarters as diesels) and so they could start and work equally heavy trains as diesels, but not to the same speeds.\n\nThis is effectively a diesel locomotive with auxiliary electric motors (or connections to the existing traction motors), usually operating from 750 V DC third rail where non-electric traction is banned (e.g. EMD FL9, GE Genesis P32AC-DM, EMD DM30AC). The primary function for these models is to provide a \"one-seat ride\" (a rail trip that doesn't require a transfer to a different train) between the electrified and non-electrified sections of a rail system or to allow trains to run through tunnels or other segments of track where diesel locomotives are generally prohibited due to their production of exhaust; such locomotives are used for certain trains servicing the New York City terminals of Grand Central Terminal and Penn Station, as the various rail tunnels into Manhattan have exhaust restrictions. Once out of the tunnels, the engines are started and operation is as a normal diesel locomotive.\n\nWith modern electronics, it is much easier to construct (or adapt) an electro-diesel locomotive or multiple-unit which is equally at home running at high speeds both \"under the wires\" and under diesel power (e.g. British Rail Class 88, Bombardier ALP-45DP). These will normally operate under pure electric traction where possible, and use the diesel engines to extend the journeys along non-electrified sections which would not be cost effective to electrify. They may also be used on long cross-country routes to take advantage of shorter sections of electrified main lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn experimental electro-diesel locomotive, DEL120, was built by London Underground in 1940 but was not a success. Two types have been built whose electricity source was a 750 V DC third rail.\n\n\nElectro-diesel locomotives whose electricity source is overhead line include:\n\n\nIn Russia, a number of electro-diesels were built which had both pantographs and diesel prime movers. These included:\n\n\nSeveral, primarily diesel locomotive types and a multiple-unit have been built to operate off a third rail into the New York City terminals of Grand Central Terminal and Penn Station (with the third rail system being rarely used on open-air tracks). The following are in service:\n\nThe following were retired from New York City service:\n\nThe South African Class 38-000 is a electro-diesel locomotive designed by Consortium under the leadership of Siemens and built by Union Carriage and Wagon (UCW) in Nigel, Gauteng, South Africa. Between November 1992 and 1993 fifty of these locomotives were placed in service by Spoornet, formerly the South African Railways (SAR) and later renamed Transnet Freight Rail (TFR). The diesel engine enables the locomotive to shunt on unelectrified sidings.\n\n\nA specialized type of electro-diesel locomotive is the hybrid locomotive. Here, the electricity comes from a battery charged by the diesel engine rather than from an external supply. An example is the Green Goat switcher GG20B by Railpower Technologies, a subsidiary of R.J. Corman Railroad Group since 2009.\n\n\n"}

She won a Pulitzer Prize for drama.\n\nZoe Byrd Akins was born in Humansville, Missouri, second of three children of Thomas Jasper and Sarah Elizabeth Green Akins. Her family was heavily involved with the Missouri Republican Party, and for several years her father served as the state party chairman. Through her mother, Zoe Akins was related to prominent figures like George Washington and Duff Green. Her family moved to St. Louis, Missouri when Zoe was in her early teens. She was sent to Monticello Seminary in nearby Godfrey, Illinois for her education and later Hosmer Hall preparatory school in St. Louis. While at Hosmer Hall she was a classmate of poet Sara Teasdale, both graduating with the Class of 1903. It was at Monticello Seminary that Akins wrote her first play, a parody of a Greek tragedy. Following graduation Akins began writing a series of plays, poetry and criticism for various magazines and newspapers as well as occasional acting roles in St. Louis area theatre productions.\n\nHer first major dramatic work was \"Papa\", written in 1914. The comedy failed even though it greatly impressed both H.L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan, and she continued to write. She followed up with two other plays, \"The Magical City\" and \"Déclassée\". The latter play, which starred Ethel Barrymore, was not only a great success but \"something of a sensation, and her days of waiting were over.\" \nDuring this time several of her early plays were adapted for the screen. These adaptations were mostly failures, released as silent films in a time when the industry was transitioning to sound. While some \"talkie\" stars had notable roles in the films (Walter Pidgeon and a young Clark Gable), most of the films are now believed to be lost. In 1930, Akins had another great success with her play, \"The Greeks Had a Word For It,\" a comedy about three models in search of rich husbands \n\nIn the early 1930s, Akins became more active in film, writing several screenplays as well as continuing to sell the rights to plays such as \"The Greeks Had a Word for It\" (1930), which was adapted for the movies three times, in 1932 (as \"The Greeks Had a Word for Them\"), 1938 (as \"Three Blind Mice\"), and 1953 (\"How to Marry a Millionaire\"). Two highlights of this period were the films \"Sarah and Son\" (1930) and \"Morning Glory\" (1933), the latter remade as \"Stage Struck\". Both films earned their respective female leads (Ruth Chatterton and Katharine Hepburn) Academy Award nominations for Best Actress (Hepburn won).\n\nIn 1935, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for her dramatization of Edith Wharton's \"The Old Maid\", a melodrama set in New York City and written in five episodes stretching across time from 1839 to 1854. The play was adapted for a 1939 film starring Bette Davis.\n\nIn 1936, Akins co-wrote the screenplay for \"Camille,\" adapted from Alexandre Dumas's play and novel, \"La dame aux camélias\" The film starred Greta Garbo, Robert Taylor, and Lionel Barrymore, and earned Garbo her third Oscar nomination.\n\nDespite the fame afforded her, Akins didn't pursue a screenwriting career beyond her early successes. In 1932, she married Hugo Rumbold (in the last year of his life) and, after several Hollywood films, she returned to writing plays and spending time with her family. She was rumoured to be in a long-term relationship with Jobyna Howland until Howland's death in 1936. According to Anita Loos, the two squabbled often, \"But such gibes actually held the key to their devotion.\" She was the great-aunt of actress Laurie Metcalf. She lived for a short time in Morrisonville, Illinois.\n\nAkins died in her sleep on the eve of her 72nd birthday in Los Angeles.\n\nShe loved<br>Shakespeare's sonnets<br>Paris bonnets.<br>Country walks,<br>All-night talks,<br>Old trees and places<br>Children's faces<br>Shaw and Keats,<br>Opera seats,<br>Lonely prairies,<br>Tea at Sherry's,<br>Sunlight and air,<br>Vanity Fair\n\n\n"}

The park is located in the Hudson Plains ecozone, south of Churchill in north-east Manitoba, Canada, on the shores of Hudson Bay. Access to the park is limited due to its remote location and an effort to preserve the park. The name comes from the Cree word for polar bear (\"wâpask\"). The Park is also home to Cape Churchill, which is renowned as the best location in the world to view and photograph wild polar bears. The only way people can access Cape Churchill is by helicopter or Tundra Buggy.\n\nThe park was the subject of a short film in 2011's \"National Parks Project\", directed by Hubert Davis and scored by Kathleen Edwards, Matt Mays and Sam Roberts.\n\nWapusk is the Cree word for \"white bear\", and as the meaning indicates, the park is a significant maternity denning area for the polar bear, \"Ursus maritimus\". It includes a large part of the Hudson Bay Lowlands, a subarctic region bordering Hudson Bay that is mostly muskeg and wet peatlands. It is one of the wildest and most remote of Canadian landscapes. \n\nIn winter, the Polar Bears of Wapusk National Park come ashore as the ice on the Hudson Bay melts, waiting on the tundra until the water freeze again. Pregnant females remain ashore, sheltered in maternity dens within the peatlands in Wapusk, giving birth over the season. \n\nNumerous birds are found in the Wapusk National Park and it is a likely breeding area of the short-billed dowitcher.\n\nIn a 2010 report biologists affiliated with the American Museum of Natural History and City College of the City University of New York have prepared a new report published in \"Canadian Field-Naturalist\" that offers the first documented evidence the temperamental grizzly bears are migrating into polar bear territory. Researchers found that seven grizzlies have been spotted in Wapusk National Park south of Churchill, between 2003 and 2008.\n\nThis national park is home to animals such as polar bears, great grey owls, timber wolves, lemmings, ivory gulls, two species of fox, peregrine falcons, snowshoe hares, moose, wolverines, Caspian terns, and a herd of 3000 Cape Churchill caribou.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2023247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2023247", "title": "Nizhal Thangal", "text": "Nizhal Thangal\n\nNizhal Thangal (; also called Inai Thangals) are secondary worship places of the Ayyavazhi, often smaller in size compared to Pathis, built per the instructions of Akilattirattu Ammanai. Cleanliness is strictly enforced.\n\nThough the common people, mainly in early times call them as \"Narayanaswami koil\" or \"Narayanaswami pathi\", the Ayyavazhi scriptures consider these centers distinct from The Pathis. They call these worship centers, which were not associated with the religious activities of Vaikundar as 'Inai Thangals'.\n\nAfter the trial of Vaikundar with the king of Travancore, the followers built religious centers following his instructions to propagate his teachings which were called as \"Nizhal Thangal\". Akilattirattu Ammanai call this as religious schools. The LMS reports too speak in abundance about these worship centers\n\nTamil is the official language of worship, and the object of worship is Lord Narayana with the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.\nNizhal Thangals in Chettikudiyiruppu, Agastheeswaram, Paloor, Sundavilai, Vadalivilai, Kadambankulam and Pambankulam were established during the period of Vaikundar per Akilam. And after a large number of Thangals were established throughout India. There are more than 8000 worship centres throughout India\n\nThese Nizhal Thangals formed place in the socio-religious life of the people. All the people were brought together here irrespective of caste distinctions. The mode and formalities of worship were revolutionalised in these centers.\n\nUnlike Pathis this Thangals were of small size. Inside the Nizhal Thangals, no murti or idol is used. The Palliyarai of Thangals generally seems similar to Pathis. But inside, in most of the Thangals instead of raised pedestal, chairs were placed as asanas in which the saffron or silk cloths are wrapped-around. A garland made of rudraksha (string of rudraksha beads) is placed around the neck of the asana. Mirrors were placed behind. In front of these there will be two standing oil lamps\"(kuthu vilakku)\"made of brass, each placed on the either side of the asana.\n\nIn some of the Thangals there will be inner corridors as pathis to circumambulate the Palliyarai. A hall is attached to this palliyarai for the worshippers. In some of the Thangals there are flag masts, Vahanas and temple cars etc.\n\nSome of the thangals were built and maintained by single individuals, some by various organisations and some built as town or village-commons. Since Ayyavazhi is not an organised religion, thangals are not officially controlled by Swamithoppe, though it was considered as the religious headquarters. It was considered ritualistic by the Ayyavazhi followers to lay foundation stones for new Thangals by some one from Payyan dynasty. It seems that the scriptures too give a high status to them in such matters. A survey from the year 2004 states that there are more than 8000 Nizhal Thangals throughout South India mostly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.\n\nSome Nizhal Thangals serve as community centers, with facilities to cook for large crowds of people; others serve as schools for the community and some as both.\n\nThough the Ayyavazhi scriptures says about a three-time-worship in common for Nizal Thangals and Pathis, most of the Nizhal Thangals use to conduct \"Panividais\" (poojas) only twice per day. The three time worship includes Ukappadippu along with Pothippu at the dawn and at the dusk and the Ucchippadippu in the noon.\n\nBut most of the Nizhal Thangals conduct this Ucchippadippu on every Sundays seven times collectively, considering one time per day of a week. On that days Anna Dharmam (charity on food) is conducted. Some Thangals use conduct this Ucchippadippu on Fridays too. While at few Thangals, which were run by single individuals, the Panividai is conducted only once per day in the evening.\n\nThis \" 'Pai vaippu' \" is a festival in which the rice boiled in milk and used to serve as grew. At present every worship centers of Ayyavazhi has this practice at least once in a month, while in some other Thangals it was conducted once in a week. During this Pal vaippu cooked rice is also served in addition to this 'Pal' as an action of charity. During this days as ritualistic actions, the 'Periya Ukappadippu' (the extended Ukappadippu), ' \"Thana Niraivu Vasakam\" ' and 'Vazappadippu' is also sung in the evening as additional form of Prayers during this days.\n\nThe main form festival which is conducted in Nizhal Thangals are The Thiru Eadu Vasippu and the \"Vaikunda Avatharam\". The Thiru-Eadu Vasippu was conducted for several days while the Vaikunda Avatharam celebration is mostly for a day of time in Nizhal Thangals. Some Thangals use to conduct Annual festivals too.\n\nThis Thiru Eadu Vasippu, the ritual reading and expatiation of the Holy book Akilam, is an important religious observance of Ayyavazhi. During this days the morning \"Panivadais\" are conducted as usual, while in the evening Akilam the scripture of Ayyavazhi is read melodiously by two talented persons and another person use to explain the read verses in a prose form. At the end of every days Anna Dharmam was conducted. This festival was conducted in several Nizhal Thangals for seventeen days (as in Pathis) and the whole content is read-finished. While some other thangals conduct this for three, five, seven, or ten days term reading selected part from the scripture.\n\nSome thangals conduct this Thiru-Eadu Vasippu along with the Annual festivals while on some other centers annual festivals are celebrated separately. During that days ' \"Vahanam Eduppu\" ' is conducted in which the asanam is carried on Vahanas (vehicles) as processions by the followers.\n\nThis was the only festival in Ayyavazhi, which is celebrated at a time throughout all the worship centers across the country. During this festival on 19th masi (3 March) the day before the Ayya Vaikunda Avataram, the Nizhal Thangals used to conduct one day festival for a grand scale along with Anna Dharmam throughout the day. On the next day 20th of the Tamil month masi, (4 March) all the followers used to visit Panchappathis and so most of the Thangals remain closed while some thangals used to continue the festival as the previous day.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2023257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2023257", "title": "The Lives of John Lennon", "text": "The Lives of John Lennon\n\nThe Lives of John Lennon is a 1988 biography of musician John Lennon by American\nauthor Albert Goldman. The book is a product of several years of research and hundreds of interviews with many of Lennon's friends, acquaintances, servants and musicians. Notwithstanding, it is best known for its criticism and generally negative representation of the personal lives of Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono.\n\nWhen first published in 1988, \"The Lives of John Lennon\" was controversial because of its portrayal of Lennon in a highly critical light. Lennon was presented in the book as a talented but deeply flawed man who manipulated people and relationships throughout his life, flinging them aside when they were no longer useful to him. Goldman also suggested that Lennon was an anti-Semite and a heavy drug-user and that he was dyslexic and schizophrenic. \n\nThe author even went into detail about the long-rumored homosexual affair between Lennon and The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein (previously discussed in both Pete Shotton’s \"Lennon in My Life\" and Peter Brown's \"The Love You Make\"), as well as alleging a number of liaisons by Lennon with other men, including a claim that he solicited underage male prostitutes in Thailand. This latter assertion greatly angered Yoko Ono and Paul McCartney. The book was criticized by Lennon fans for allegedly containing much unsubstantiated conjecture, and tending to present worst-case scenarios when doing so.\n\nLennon was indeed a heavy drug user, as has been acknowledged by most people who knew him well, including Ono and Lennon's first wife, Cynthia Lennon. Other primary sources also support Goldman's claims about Lennon's tendency toward violence, a tendency Lennon himself owned up to in a \"Playboy\" interview. \n\nConcerning Lennon's supposed bisexuality, Ono said in a 1981 interview that she told Lennon—although it's unclear whether or not she was just teasing him—that he was a \"closet fag\" because he used to tell Yoko he liked her because she looked \"like a bloke in drag\". Of the affair Goldman alleges between Lennon and Epstein, Lennon said in his 1980 \"Playboy\" interview that their relationship \"was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated.\"\n\nAccording to accounts in Goldman's book, Lennon felt guilty over having attacked a sailor he met during the Beatles' time in Hamburg, and also over the sudden death of bandmate Stuart Sutcliffe. Goldman also presents a story from an Ono assistant that Ono's 1968 miscarriage was triggered by a beating from Lennon.\n\nGoldman does show genuine respect for Lennon's musical achievements with the Beatles and his solo work (although he dismisses the widely acclaimed \"Imagine\"). Lennon's copyright infringement lawsuit for \"Come Together\" is also explored in the text.\n\nGoldman also claims that when Lennon started making music again in 1980 following a long hibernation, he was not oblivious to Manhattan's cocaine-fueled disco scene. According to Goldman, on the day Lennon was murdered he was scheduled to undergo plastic surgery several days later to repair his nasal septum due to snorting cocaine, which he supposedly did at the Hit Factory recording studio where he and Ono recorded their album \"Double Fantasy\". Goldman does not cite a single name of anyone who might have witnessed this at the studio. \n\nGoldman alleges further that on December 8, 1980 (the day of Lennon's murder) not only did the singer's cocaine snorting warrant plastic surgery, but he was in such bad physical condition from drug abuse and lack of exercise that during his autopsy the medical examiner recorded observations to that effect, overlooking the four bullet wounds momentarily.\n\nThe overarching theme of the book is to debunk the notion that Lennon retired from the music business for five years, from 1975 until the rehearsals for his 1980 comeback album, \"Double Fantasy\", to live as a \"househusband,\" as \"Rolling Stone\" magazine and \"Playboy\" famously described him, and to raise the couple's son, Sean. Goldman asserts that in reality a drug-addicted Lennon retreated into a secluded, darkened room in Manhattan's Dakota building watching television all day, every day, leaving domestic servants to tend to his son, while Ono was feeding a chronic heroin habit and managing his share of profits from the Beatles’ music. This portrayal is supported by the book \"\", which is based on Lennon's own diaries from the months and weeks leading up to his murder.\n\nGoldman further asserts that this drug-addled, dangerously unhealthy isolation was a result of Lennon's natural laziness and dependence on strong women throughout his life. Goldman also claims that Lennon’s isolation and physical decline was instigated by Yoko Ono, who Goldman claims was jealous of Lennon and saw his fame as competition for her own musical ambitions.\n\nGoldman contends Ono encouraged Lennon's heroin addiction as a way of controlling him and his vast fortune, to her own ends. She also supposedly used tarot-reading charlatans to feed Lennon readings that would urge him to take various courses of action Ono supported. These readings would determine seemingly trivial choices of Lennon's life, such as which route their limousine would take to transport them home from the studio or which day was most propitious on which to record music, but were, in fact, according to Goldman, often part of Ono's constant machinations. Ono's concern for routes and directions reflects a belief in Japanese traditional katatagae, but this is overlooked by Goldman, who has been accused of racism.\n\nGoldman also alleges Lennon's musical comeback in 1980 was only allowed, and then orchestrated, by Ono after she realized her own ambitions for performing music on the A list without Lennon were futile.\n\nHe also enumerates what he describes as Ono's lavish spending habits, wasting of Lennon's resources, abuse of domestic servants and personal assistants, even to the point of setting up May Pang as Lennon's girlfriend and Ono's personal spy during his Lost Weekend when he was separated from Ono from mid-1973 to February 1975. These allegations are confirmed by Pang in her own book.\n\nGoldman quotes Harold Seider, Lennon's lawyer for the last few years of his life, as saying that much of Lennon's public image was largely fabricated:\nLennon comes across much better than Yoko Ono, for whom Goldman shows unbridled contempt. Goldman insults Ono's appearance, describing her as \"simian-looking\". Goldman alleges that Ono had been a prostitute while attending Sarah Lawrence College, and depicts her as a willing participant in various alleged crimes of her previous husband, Tony Cox. Goldman also goes into great detail about Ono's treatment of Lennon's first wife Cynthia, and Ono's unconventional behavior and personality. Goldman also depicts Ono as pressuring Lennon into heroin use, as greedy and stingy, and indulging in infidelity with gigolos.\n\nCynthia Lennon claims that the material for Goldman's depiction of her and Lennon's marriage was taken from her book \"A Twist of Lennon\" and given a negative spin.\n\nGoldman depicts Paul McCartney in an extremely positive light, as being the only true talent among the Beatles, and the man who made the band able to function. On January 16, 1980, customs officials in Japan found 7.7 ounces (218.3 g) of cannabis in McCartney's luggage as he and the other musicians in Wings tried to enter the country for a concert tour. Goldman asserts that this incident was orchestrated by Yoko Ono. She supposedly had advance notice that her husband's friend would be smuggling drugs into her homeland. She allegedly made overseas telephone calls to government officials she knew with the hope that he would be arrested, thereby giving her a good excuse to forbid her husband from communicating with his friend. More controversially, Goldman depicts manager Allen Klein as someone who had the Beatles' best interests in mind, and who was railroaded by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission when he was tried, convicted, and served prison time for insider trading and securities fraud.\n\nGoldman implies that Mark David Chapman's murder of John Lennon may have been part of a conspiracy by fundamentalist Christians. Chapman was a fundamentalist who viewed Lennon as a corrupter of youth. Goldman does not offer any conclusions, but mentions that the NYPD files on Lennon's murder are sealed and any conclusive answer would have to wait until the files are released to the public.\n\nLennon's widow Yoko Ono threatened to sue for libel, claiming the book made her briefly consider suicide, but never pursued any legal action, later stating that she wanted to maintain a positive attitude and that her lawyers had advised her a civil action would only draw more attention to the book.\n\nLennon's first wife Cynthia Lennon denounced the book, stating, \"Every single person was annihilated. My mother was called a bulldog and a domineering woman, which was nothing—\"nothing\"—like my mother. And he called \"me\" a spaniel. I thought, I'd rather be a spaniel than a Rottweiler, which is what he was.\"\n\nDespite Goldman's praise of him in the book, Paul McCartney did not return the favor, and condemned Goldman's account of his old bandmate, telling fans and the press \"Look, don't buy it.\" He also called it \"a piece of trash\" and claimed Goldman made up \"any old bunch of lies he sees fit\". George Harrison, Lennon's former bandmate, criticized the book and Goldman, stating that Goldman was \"slagging off someone who's dead\". Singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson, whose friendship with Lennon peaked during his 1974 separation from Ono, told \"Rolling Stone\" that Goldman \"got me drunk\" while interviewing him, probing Nilsson for \"dirt\" about Lennon, and Nilsson would not cooperate. (Nilsson gets a chapter in the book, \"Harry the Hustler\", which credits him with having better confidence-man skills than singing talent.) John Lennon's close friend Cilla Black said she was never interviewed by Goldman or his assistants, questioning the accuracy of the book and Goldman's claim to have interviewed over a thousand people who knew Lennon well.\n\nIn Ray Coleman's \"Lennon: The Definitive Biography\", there appears the following quote from The Beatles' record producer George Martin: \"I think it is iniquitous that people can libel the dead. If John was alive, that book would not have come out. It is largely untrue, but, sadly, if mud is thrown it tends to stick.\" Martin also labeled the book as \"codswallop\".\n\nOther celebrities who had known Lennon personally, including Geraldo Rivera and Tom Snyder, also largely dismissed the book. An uncredited review on UPI dated September 12, 1988, observes that Goldman expresses \"deep contempt\" for Lennon, his family, the other Beatles and rock music in general; that he resorted to the \"sleaziest methods\" to dig up dirt on Lennon; and that he engages in \"schoolyard name-calling\" and seems obsessed with Lennon's sex life.\n\nThe October 20, 1988 issue of \"Rolling Stone\" lambasted the book in a lengthy and extensively researched article by David Fricke and Jeffrey Ressner, \"Imaginary Lennon\". The reviewers described the book as \"riddled with factual inaccuracies, embroidered accounts of true events that border on fiction and suspect information provided by tainted sources.\" Further, Fricke and Ressner stated that \"\"Rolling Stone\" spoke to sources interviewed by Goldman who said that they were misquoted or that the information they provided him was used out of context. Other figures close to Lennon who refused to speak to Goldman or were not contacted by him claim that incidents in the book in which they appear either never happened or did not occur in the way Goldman recounts them.\" Among the factual errors listed by \"Rolling Stone\":\n\nDavid Gates responded in \"Newsweek\" by reminding readers that a romantic vision of Lennon is just as much of a myth as Goldman's portrayal. Editor Jann Wenner is quoted as saying that the book \"offended him at every level\", suggesting that he as a personal friend of the Lennons had good reason to want to preserve an idealistic version of Lennon's life. However, by stating a number of easily researched facts, the article also exposes a number of Goldman's inaccuracies and concludes with a reminder that the best way to know Lennon is through his recordings. Gates noted in the article that Goldman presents no evidence for his claim that Lennon patronized male prostitutes in Thailand or that Lennon killed a sailor in Hamburg, and only secondhand hearsay for the tale of Lennon blaming himself for Stuart Sutcliffe's death.\n\nLouis Menand in \"The New Republic\" described the sourcing of Goldman's book as \"vague and unreliable\". Menand wrote of Goldman's book that \"The little things don't matter, of course, if the big things can be trusted. But the big things can't.\" Luc Sante, in \"The New York Review of Books\", said about the account of Lennon's consumption of LSD in the book: \"Goldman's background research was either slovenly or nonexistent,\" and that the only establishing quote for the LSD story was \"from a novel called \"Groupie\" (author unidentified)\".\n\nGoldman denounced the \"Rolling Stone\" article as \"a farrago of groundless or insignificant charges designed to discredit my biography of John Lennon\". He also mocked what he called \"the stupidity of the [\"Newsweek\"] magazine employees who were assigned the task of smearing me and my book\", and concluded by saying that Sante was \"a young man of no reputation in the field of popular culture.\" Sante good-naturedly replied that Goldman's tirade proved that the book was a gigantic, humorous \"put-on\".\n\nAuthor Phillip Norman, whose own biography of Lennon (\"John Lennon: The Life\") was published 20 years after \"The Lives of John Lennon\", described Goldman's book as \"malevolent\" and \"risibly ignorant\".\n\nOn their 1988 album \"Rattle and Hum\", U2 attacked Goldman's allegations about Lennon in the song \"God Part 2\", a \"sequel\" of sorts to Lennon's song \"God\", with the lyrics \"Don't believe in Goldman/his type is like a curse/Instant karma's gonna get him if I don't get him first.\"\n\nAn October 1988 episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" featured a sketch revolving around why Goldman wrote the book, claiming it was in retaliation for The Beatles kicking him out of the band in 1962. Phil Hartman played Goldman (On Trombone), Dana Carvey played Paul McCartney, Dennis Miller (in a rare non-\"Weekend Update\" role) played George Harrison, Jon Lovitz played Ringo Starr, and guest host Matthew Broderick played John Lennon. In the sketch, another subject of Goldman, Elvis Presley, (played by Kevin Nealon) is the one who urges Lennon to fire Goldman.\n\n"}

Its captain was Henry B. Robeson (graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1860). The ship put into Villefranche, France, in October 1877, and left on 13 December with the former President, General Ulysses S. Grant, and his party as passengers. During the next three months, the screw sloop of war touched at ports in Italy, Egypt, Turkey, and Greece before Grant and his party disembarked at Naples on 18 March 1878. After making several more Mediterranean cruises, \"Vandalia\" received orders to return to the United States later that year. She put into Boston on 13 January 1879 and departed on 7 April, bound for Norfolk, Virginia, and duty with the North Atlantic Squadron.\n\n\"Vandalia\" remained with the North Atlantic Squadron for five years. During this time, she performed patrol, reconnaissance, and convoy escort duty off the eastern seaboard of the United States. The vessel was also active off the Grand Banks, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean. \"Vandalia\" was detached from the squadron in 1884 and put out of commission at the Portsmouth Navy Yard on 14 October for a thorough overhaul.\n\nRepairs continued for over a year before \"Vandalia\" was ready for recommissioning on 15 February 1886. The sloop left New York on 14 August, heading westward for duty with the Pacific Squadron as the flagship of Rear Admiral Lewis Kimberly. \"Vandalia\" remained with the squadron into 1889, seeing duty in the Hawaiian Islands and Samoa, as well as along the Pacific coasts of North, Central, and South America. The sloop put into the Mare Island Navy Yard, San Francisco, for repairs on 11 October 1888.\n\nWhile \"Vandalia\" lay at Mare Island, relations between American and German officials at Apia, Samoa, became increasingly strained. Late in the winter of 1889, at the behest of the American consul in Samoa, \"Vandalia\", , and sailed for Samoa and reached Apia Harbor early in March to balance the presence of the German vessels , , and . The British were ably represented by . On 15 and 16 March 1889, each of these vessels suddenly became trapped in the harbor when violent, hurricane-force winds roared out of the northeast, driving mountainous waves before them in the 1889 Apia cyclone. \"Adler\", \"Olga\", and \"Eber\" were all either sunk or hopelessly grounded and torn apart on the sharp reef, and together lost a total of 150 officers and crew killed. The powerful engines of \"Calliope\" barely enabled the vessel to get to sea in a dramatic performance that drew cheers from the crews of the American vessels. However, despite heroic efforts by the officers and crews of \"Vandalia\" and \"Trenton\", the two vessels tore their bottoms out upon the reef on 16 March. \"Vandalia\" struck at about noon and sank until her decks were completely awash, forcing her crew to scramble into the rigging. \"Trenton\" grounded alongside \"Vandalia\" at 2200 that evening, but enough of her main deck remained above water to allow \"Vandalia's\" crew to climb on board. After the hurricane began, \"Nipsic\" was driven ashore on a sandy beach and was later salvaged.\n\nAmerican casualties totalled 52 killed, 43 from \"Vandalia\" alone. The survivors from \"Vandalia\", \"Trenton\", and \"Nipsic\" soon sailed for Mare Island on board a chartered steamer, but \"Vandalia\" and \"Trenton\" themselves were so battered that they were soon dismantled and their scrap donated to the Samoans. One of Vandalia's survivors was Naval Cadet John A. Lejeune, a future major general, the 13th Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps and namesake of Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, N.C.\n\n"}

It was secularized in 1803. The prince-bishop resided in Speyer, a Free Imperial City, until the 14th century when he moved his residence to Uddenheim (Philippsburg), then in 1723 to Bruchsal, in large part due to the tense relationship between successive prince-bishops and the civic authorities of the Free City, officially Protestant since the Reformation. The prince-provostry of Wissemburg in Alsace was ruled by the prince-bishop of Speyer in a personal union.\n\nThe Prince-Bishopric of Speyer belonged to the Upper Rhenish Circle of the Holy Roman Empire. One of the smallest principalities of the Holy Roman Empire, it consisted of more than half a dozen separate enclaves totalling about 28 German square miles (about 1540 km²) on both sides of the Rhine. It included the towns of Bruchsal (on the right bank) as well as Deidesheim, Herxheim bei Landau, and Lauterburg (on the left bank). Around 1800 the bishopric included about 55,000 people.\n\nA diocese of Speyer has possibly existed since the 3rd or 4th century. It was first mentioned in historical documents in 614. Up to 748 it was a suffragant bishopric of the archdiocese of Trier, and from then until the secularisation of the prince-bishopric in 1803, of the archdiocese of Mainz.\n\nThe history of the Bishopric of Speyer began at the latest in the late 7th century when the bishop of Speyer received royal domains in the neighboring Speyergau. In the 10th and 11th centuries, the diocese received additional lands, including gifts by emperor Otto I. In 1030 the building of the cathedral was begun. In 1061 the cathedral was consecrated. In 1086 emperor Henry IV granted the bishopric the remaining parts of the county of Speyergau.\n\nFrom 1111 the citizens of the city of Speyer began to increasingly loosen their bonds to the rulership of the bishop. In 1230 a Bürgermeister was mentioned for the first time. In 1294 Speyer became a Free Imperial City. The bishop moved his palace in 1371 to Udenheim. At the beginning of the 17th century bishop Philipp Christoph von Sötern expanded the fortress of Philippsburg. The prince-bishops reigned from there from 1371 to 1723. Afterwards the prince-bishop moved his seat to Bruchsal.\n\nFrom 1681 to 1697, at the end of the War of the Grand Alliance, the fortress of Philippsburg on the left-bank went to France. In 1801/1802, the remaining left-bank territories of Speyer were conquered by French troops in the course of the French Revolution. The right-bank territories went to margraves of Baden.\n\nThis ended the secular responsibilities of the bishop of Speyer. The secularized bishopric continued ecclesiastically as the Diocese of Speyer. Finally, the French part of the former prince-bishopric was divided between Bavaria and Hesse Darmstadt in 1815. \n\n"}

{"id": "2023287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2023287", "title": "Gebrauchsmusik", "text": "Gebrauchsmusik\n\nWhile composer Paul Hindemith is probably the figure most identified with this expression, it seems to have been coined within the realm of musicology rather than composition. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the modern academic discipline of musicology was formulated by a mainly German group of scholars who were interested not only in formal development and biographical data, but also to an extent in the sociopolitical position of music throughout history, and the relationship of music and musicians to society at large.\n\nPerhaps the first such musicologist to use the word \"Gebrauchsmusik\" was , writing in , who employed it in reference to half of his perceived binarism between that 17th-century dance music which was in fact danced to, and that which was written in dance forms but was actually abstract music intended only for listening (by extension, this duality applied to the dichotomy between any music for a specific purpose, \"Gebrauchsmusik\", and that for none but the pleasure or edification of listening, \"Vortragsmusik\").\n\nNettl arrived at this dual-development view of dance music through his observation that such pieces began, as the century progressed, to use stylistic and formal devices that were farther from the province of simple utility and more aligned with some anticipation of a listening audience paying full attention. The period's emerging binary dance form featured such characteristics as an increasing tonicization of foreign keys, an increasingly explicit and emphasized dominant-tonic tonal axis, and a refined delicacy of ornamentation, all of which would seem superfluous in application to a music intended only as the rhythmic accompaniment to physical activity. In addition to these developments in the individual movements, they were organized into ever more extended and stylized suites, which greatly resembled other instrumental forms of the day. Indeed, the mature sonata da camera is virtually indistinguishable from the dance suite of the time.\n\nNettl saw in this situation a clear distinction between music that was intended mainly to be in the service of dancers, and that which was mainly intended to service the ideals of art. In articulating this distinction, however, Nettl did not imply that utility music was unimportant artistically. Instead, he pointed out the importance of social need or desire as a catalyst for artistic development.\n\nTwo years later, also discussing the 17th-century suite (in \"Beiträge zur Stilgeschichte der deutschen Suite im 17. Jahrhundert\", ), Heinrich Besseler went a step further, to imply that such utility music was socially superior, if not artistically so. For Besseler, \"aesthetic access\" (\"\") to the dance music was gained through participation, be it playing, dancing, or even singing along, rather than mere listening. He further expounded this thesis in a 1925 article on motets of the Medieval period, in which he proposed that such works had not been designed for the enjoyment of listeners, but with only their devotional purpose in mind; this purpose would only be fulfilled through participation, whether performance or prayer. In making this point, Besseler sought to divide all music into two distinct categories, continuing to use the word \"Gebrauchsmusik\" for one, and likening this to vernacular language, while replacing Nettl's word for the other with \"eigenständige Musik\"—alone-standing, or autonomous music. Besseler had studied philosophy with Martin Heidegger, and thought that this musical duality reflected Heidegger's between \"thing\" and \"equipment\", for the autonomous and the specific-purposed, respectively.\n\nIt was Besseler's notion of this concept which took hold in German musical culture of the 1920s and 1930s, becoming something of a controversy within that sphere, and even spilling into political ideology. Such a distinction had always existed in music, and that some works had always been composed for specific occasions and others not (at least since the Renaissance, in all probability), is attested to by the work of Besseler and Nettl, who based their concepts on studies of the historical situation. Even so, the musicologically conceived term \"Gebrauchsmusik\" somehow came to be construed as a concept of modern political administration. Some composers and government officials identified a need for community music, to be played by amateurs and young people at large festivals; the long German tradition of community singing benefited greatly from this impulse. Hindemith, Kurt Weill, and many others contributed works with such intentions in mind as the fledgling Weimar Republic tried to stave off collapse. The cultural, rather than solely political, nature of this movement will be seen, however, from the observation that Hindemith was for the most part a political agnostic, while Weill was an avowed leftist. Composers, regardless of their political views, were largely in favor of the \"Gebrauchsmusik\" concept at its outset because a recognized need and desire for occasion-tailored works would lead to a constant call for them. All combatants in the political arena saw in community music-making a potential glue with which to unite the German people behind their respective agendas; rather than expend the often wasted effort of regaling them with rhetoric, left and right alike could simply awe the public with spectacle and envelop them in the ecstasy of art. The right wing took \"Gebrauchsmusik\" as a tool when the former began its ascendancy, which is probably the main reason for the latter's increased discredit and abandonment as the decade progressed, and the most important German artists and thinkers departed for more hospitable locales.\n\nA second reason, though, for this discredit was the occurrence to certain composers and their followers that composing music for large-scale public use would lead to a need for them to pander as well to large-scale public taste. Such a concept was anathematic to the art-for-art's-sake ideal which followed alongside that of community music in Germany since the days of Beethoven, who had ushered in the era of the well-regarded and financially successful free-lance composer. Schoenberg wrote to the effect that \"Gebrauchsmusik\" would hardly out-live its present-day application, while that composed for art and no other purpose would have the only chance at immortality. Schoenberg also noted that there had been less and less call for such utility music since the end of the Republic anyway, and certainly since the conclusion of the war. As a result of this, \"Gebrauchsmusik\"'s most ardent promoters had again become \"ideal artists\" . Earlier (; ), the critic Theodor Adorno had called the work of Hindemith and other \"Gebrauchsmusiker\" symptomatic of \"false [social] consciousness\", and condemned it as being not truly useful at all, due to what he considered its lack of emotional content. By the late 1950s, \"Gebrauchsmusik\" had become almost universally a term of insult, especially among composers. No less than Hindemith attempted, somewhat, to back away from it, when in a lecture at Harvard in 1950, he said that \"quite obviously music for which no use can be found, that is to say, useless music, is not entitled to public consideration anyway and consequently the \"Gebrauch\" is taken for granted\", and also that \"[u]p to this day it has been impossible to kill the silly term and the unscrupulous classification that goes with it\" (quoting himself in ).\n\nAdorno had included Stravinsky among the targets of his anti-\"Gebrauchsmusik\" diatribes, and though the terminology and classification-system under present consideration is clearly and primarily German, the impulse of composers to write and officials to commission music for specific or ceremonial use is quite obviously universal. Stravinsky is perhaps not the best example of a non-German composer in such a vein who was active in the 1920s and 1930s, but he did make his name largely with a series of ballets. Along with these, it will be well-remembered that immortal and beloved works of Orff, Kodály, Bartók, Copland, and many others were written under the impulse of \"Gebrauchsmusik\". As the dawn of the 21st century pushes the blinding political travails of times past into the fog of history, modern commentators have begun to consider that, while \"Gebrauchsmusik\" may compromise the composer in some respects, many of the greatest works of not only the 20th century but the 19th and earlier (witness the French tradition of vast, ceremonial works from that period) were composed with public and popular usage in mind. As Kurt Weill wrote in , the use for which a composition was intended and its artistic value are matters for separate consideration. Indeed, they always have been, and continue to be now; to this attests the continued success of the above-considered composers and their works long after their original \"utility\" has subsided.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 22, 1995. In the episode, Homer recounts the story of Maggie's birth when the kids ask why there are no photos of her in the family album.\n\nThe episode was written by Jennifer Crittenden and directed by Swinton O. Scott III. This was both Crittenden and Scott's first episode on \"The Simpsons\". It features cultural references to television series such as \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" and \"Knight Rider\". Since airing, the episode has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics, and has been called \"a touching look at fatherhood\" by Kevin Wong of PopMatters. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 10.3, and was the fourth highest rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.\n\nWhile browsing through the family photo album, Lisa notices it contains no baby pictures of Maggie. Homer explains why by recounting the story of Maggie's birth. \n\nIn 1993, Homer hated his job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and dreamed of working at a bowling alley. After receiving a paycheck clearing him of all his debts, he quit his job at the power plant, humiliating Mr. Burns and literally burning a bridge during his departure. Homer was thrilled with his new job at Barney's Uncle Al's bowling alley.\n\nWhen Homer and Marge \"snuggled\" to celebrate his new job, she became pregnant. Marge made Patty and Selma promise not to tell him, but they told two people known for gossiping. By the next day the entire city of Springfield knew Marge was pregnant. Homer was blind to obvious signs, even when Moe congratulated him for getting Marge pregnant and her friends and family threw her a baby shower. When Maude casually congratulated him on his new job, Homer suddenly realized Marge was pregnant. The news upset him because he was happier working at the bowling than any other job.\n\nMarge urged Homer to ask Al for a raise. Al explained the alley's profits prevented him from offering one unless Homer could find a way to increase business threefold. Homer tried to attract more customers by firing a shotgun outside the bowling alley, which only caused a massive panic and large police response. Unable to drum up business, Homer quit his dream job and returned to the power plant. Mr. Burns made Homer beg for his job back and placed a large plaque near his desk which read: \"Don't forget: you're here forever\". Homer was miserable at work again, but he instantly fell in love with Maggie when she was born. \n\nBack in the present, Bart and Lisa still do not understand what this story has to do with Maggie's missing baby pictures. Homer says the photos are where he needs them most — on the plaque, which he has altered to read: \"Do it for her\".\n\nThe episode was written by Jennifer Crittenden, and directed by Swinton O. Scott III. This was the first episode Scott directed for the show. Crittenden also made her debut as a writer for \"The Simpsons\" in this episode. Crittenden was taking a beginners' writing program at 20th Century Fox when former \"The Simpsons\" showrunner David Mirkin hired her on the show. Crittenden's only writing experience before that had been as an intern on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\". 20th Century Fox introduced Crittenden to Mirkin, and Mirkin read a script of hers that he liked. When Mirkin first talked to Crittenden, he thought she was a really nice woman who was very mature. Crittenden was only 23 years old at the time, but Mirkin liked her and he hired her.\n\nAfter Homer quits his job at the power plant, he violently tosses his old boss Mr. Burns out of the cart he is driving. Homer then drives across a wooden bridge and tosses a match onto it; the whole bridge is instantly engulfed in flames. Mirkin came up with the joke, and said that \"the thing with animation is that you can stage almost anything and time it perfectly, something you would not be able to do in live action\". As a live-action director, Mirkin said he enjoys the amount of control they have in animation.\n\nIn the episode, Mr. Burns places a \"de-motivational plaque\" in Homer's station that reads \"Don't forget: you're here forever\". Homer then places photos of Maggie around the plaque to alter it into saying \"Do it for her\". \"The Simpsons\" writer George Meyer, who enjoys writing jokes that involve anagrams or any other forms of word play, came up with the idea for this particular joke. The joke is also an homage to Al Jaffee's Fold-in features in the \"Mad\" magazine.\n\nOn September 4, 2018, 23 years after the episode's original broadcast, Simpsons producer Matt Selman posted a tweet saying that he had noticed a continuity error in the episode. When Marge announces to Homer that she is pregnant with Maggie, a photo of the baby can be seen in the background.\n\nThe couch gag is a reference to the James Bond gun barrel sequence. Dr. Hibbert's flashback hairstyle is modeled after Arsenio Hall's. The family watches \"Knight Boat\", a parody of \"Knight Rider\". Homer spinning around with a bowling ball in his hand before throwing it into the air and exclaiming \"I'm gonna make it after all\" is reminiscent of the opening of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" where Mary throws her hat into the air.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"And Maggie Makes Three\" finished 47th in the ratings for the week of January 16 to January 22, 1995, with a Nielsen rating of 10.3. The episode was the fourth highest rated show on the Fox network that week, beaten only by \"Melrose Place\", \"Beverly Hills, 90210\", and the \"Rock 'n' Roll Skating Championship\".\n\nSince airing, the episode has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics. One-time \"The Simpsons\" writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named it his second favorite episode, and said: \"Mr. Burns gives [Homer] this terrible plaque above his desk that says, 'Don't forget: You're here forever.' It's about how sometimes things don't go the way you planned, which is pretty amazing in a cartoon. Homer then puts up all the pictures of Maggie he's ever taken to strategically cover this horrible thing so it now reads, 'Do it for her.' It gives me a lump in the throat thinking about it.\" Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", said: \"A surprisingly traditional episode. The flashback to 1993 seems a bit odd, but this is a good example of a story that doesn't overly rely on set pieces and confounded expectations for its success.\" In a review of the sixth season, Joshua Klein of the \"Chicago Tribune\" cited \"And Maggie Makes Three\", \"Treehouse of Horror V\", \"Homer Badman\", and \"Lisa's Rival\" among his favorite episodes of the season.\n\nTV Squad's Adam Finley said the episode \"manages to be both incredibly funny and incredibly touching, both signs of a great \"Simpsons\" episode\". He added that \"the episode has some great gags in it, but the emotion is very real, too. Homer is not thrilled with the idea of having a baby, and the episode does a wonderful job of showing the dark side of having another mouth to feed.\" Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review of the sixth season DVD: \"Flashback episodes of \"The Simpsons\" usually work well, and [this episode] is no exception to that rule. Actually, at this point it’s one of my favorites, but that’s partially because of overexposure to some of the other episodes. In any case, this one has many hilarious moments – such as the scene that explains Homer's hair loss.\" Kevin Wong at PopMatters said the episode is \"a touching look at fatherhood\".\n\n"}

He made his debut in January 1982 at the age of 16 at Gloucester Leisure Centre, under the name John Savage. He wrestled in the United Kingdom for two years, having regular TV bouts with Alan Kilby and Drew McDonald before moving over to Canada with his wife Jane.\n\nJoining Stampede Wrestling in 1985, Hindley was billed as Davey Boy Smith's brother, Johnny Smith. He was there involved in a storyline in 1988 where they had a heated rivalry, eventually his storyline sister and brother-in-law Diana Hart and Owen Hart also got involved after Johnny disrespected the Hart family. In February 1989, he began feuding with Dynamite Kid after interfering during a British Bulldogs-Karachi Vice rematch, attacking him from behind and cutting his hair. In May, Dynamite had turned on Davey Boy Smith, and Johnny began teaming with Dynamite as The British Bruisers, feuding with Davey Boy and Chris Benoit.\n\nIn 1987, he went on his first Japanese tour in New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). In February 1989, he followed The Dynamite Kid to wrestle for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and replaced Davey Boy Smith as Dynamite Kid's tag team partner in September 1990, forming the tag team: The British Bruisers.\n\nIn between tours in All Japan, Hindley would wrestle the independent circuit in the United States and Canada, as well as brief stints in Extreme Championship Wrestling.\n\nOn 10 April 2003, Hindley collapsed prior to his match at an All Japan Pro Wrestling show. Paramedics were called to the Hiroshima Arena and Hindley was rushed to a local hospital, having lost feeling in some parts of his body, but was in stable condition at a local Japanese hospital. Some believe this incident to be connected to a previous injury. Sometime after the incident, Hindley retired. He was planning to make a comeback in March 2004 for IWA Japan, but chose to remain retired due to health reasons.\n\nHindley is married to a woman named Jane.\n\nHindley became a police officer for the city of Calgary.\n\nAccording to Dynamite Kid's autobiography, \"Pure Dynamite\", Hindley was an English gentleman and a modest personality, as he was one of the few foreign wrestlers that did not negotiate anything at all, letting Giant Baba pay him what he thought was fair.\n\nHindley was also known to be very kind to his fans. One night, a Japanese fan had made a ring jacket for him and was so nice and generous that Johnny didn't have the heart to point out the mistake on it (the misspelling of his first name, which ended up being \"Jhonny\") to him and wore the jacket throughout his career.\n\n\n"}

She was launched in June 1813 and took part in several indecisive battles on the Great Lakes. She was laid up at the end of the war and was sold in 1825.\n\nShe was named for Brigadier General Zebulon Pike, who was killed by an exploding enemy magazine at the Battle of York on 26 April 1813. The ship was laid down on 9 April 1813 at Sackets Harbor, New York, by Henry Eckford, a New York City shipbuilder who supervised the construction of warships on Lake Ontario. The ship was roughly the same dimensions as the frigate , and the largest yet built on any of the Great Lakes.\n\nFrom the outset, Commodore Isaac Chauncey, the American naval commander on the lakes, wanted the new ship to be armed with a broadside of long guns with longer range than the carronades mounted on most of the vessels of the opposing British squadron. \"General Pike\" was therefore fitted with 26 of the Pattern 1794 24-pounder long guns originally fitted to the , but since replaced. Two of these guns were mounted on pivots on the topgallant forecastle (a platform above the forward gun deck) and the poop deck, and could fire on either broadside.\n\nOn 29 May, the British under Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost and Commodore Sir James Lucas Yeo attacked Sacket's Harbor, intending to destroy \"General Pike\" before it could be launched. During the resulting battle of Sackett's Harbor, the Americans feared that the town was about to be captured and prematurely set fire to \"General Pike\" and vast quantities of stores. The British called off the attack at this point and the ship was saved, although $500,000 worth of materials had been destroyed.\n\n\"General Pike\" was launched on 12 June. Master Commandant Arthur Sinclair was appointed to command. The fitting out and setting up of rigging was delayed by the loss of the stores during the earlier battle but the ship was made ready to sail by July and joined Chauncey's squadron on 21 July. From then until the end of the year, \"General Pike\" usually served as Chauncey's flagship. She sailed to the head of Lake Ontario, arriving off Niagara on 24 July. While cruising the lake, \"General Pike\" engaged British ships under Commodore Yeo in an indecisive battle on 10–11 August.\n\n\"General Pike\" returned to Sackett's Harbor on 13 August and provisioned before returning to the head of the lake to search out British ships. After almost a month of manoeuvering and stalking to gain an advantage over the British, the ship was engaged in a brief encounter against the British off the mouth of the Genesee River on 11 September. On 28 September the two forces again met at York Bay, and engaged in a fierce, but ultimately still indecisive battle. As Chauncey had hoped and Yeo had feared, \"General Pike\"s heavy broadside partly dismasted Yeo's flagship, the sloop of war . The British squadron immediately fled downwind into Burlington Bay. The Americans could not overtake the British as many of the fastest American vessels were towing the slowest schooners to prevent them being left behind. \"General Pike\" was towing the schooner \"Asp\" and Chauncey refused to cast loose the tow during the chase. Chauncey called off the chase when the British anchored in Burlington Bay and the rising wind threatened to drive both squadrons onto the lee shore, which was British territory.\n\n\"General Pike\" had inflicted heavy damage, but because the British fire had been concentrated on her, had also suffered severely. \"Wolfe\" had brought down her mizzen topmast and during the pursuit, the main topgallant mast had also fallen and the rigging of the foremast and bowsprit had been damaged. There were several hits below the waterline forward, and a cannon had exploded, killing or wounding twenty men and damaging the topgallant forecastle. Four other guns also were badly cracked and threatened to burst.\n\nAfter returning to Sackett's Harbor for repairs early in October, \"General Pike\" supported troop movements against the British at the lower end of Lake Ontario until mid-November when she returned to the Niagara Peninsula to cover the transfer of American troops from Fort Niagara to Sackett's Harbor. She remained at Sackett's Harbor during the winter months. Sinclair had received promotion to Captain during the year and asked for an independent command. He was later appointed to command on Lake Erie. His replacement in command of \"General Pike\" was Master Commandant William M. Crane.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the War of 1812, \"General Pike\" continued to operate with Chauncey's squadron, although no longer as flagship once Chauncey had commissioned two larger frigates. After the British withdrew blockading ships from Sackett's Harbor early in June 1814, \"General Pike\" joined other American ships in a counter-blockade of the British squadron at Kingston. The Americans kept Yeo's ships confined to Kingston harbor, and \"General Pike\" cruised Lake Ontario freely from the head of the St. Lawrence River to Sackett's Harbor until October, when the American squadron withdrew into its base.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, \"General Pike\" was laid up at Sackett's Harbor. She was sold in 1825.\n\n"}

Owned by Entercom, the station's studios are located in the unincorporated Clark County area of Spring Valley, while its transmitter is atop Black Mountain in Henderson.\n\n98.5 KLUC has been a long time Top 40 station in Las Vegas.\n\nThe signal was originally owned by Rainbow, Incorporated as KRBO-FM. Rainbow sold it to Meyer (Mike) Gold, who signed it on in 1963. Western Cities Broadcasting bought KLUC in the mid-1970s. In 1985, Western Cities was acquired by Nationwide. In 1995, a couple of years before Nationwide Communications was acquired, American Radio Systems bought KLUC, and then CBS Radio in 1997.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom.

In 1977 KLUC experimented with a \"Disco Format\" in the evenings, but it was short-lived. This changed in the fall of 1983, when KLUC added more R&B and dance music product. KLUC \"leaned dance\" through the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s before officially shifting to Rhythmic CHR in 1993 even though KLUC remained the mass appeal station in the Las Vegas market. Through its many years KLUC would play everything from the biggest rhythmic hits to big pop hits. This was especially true during the late 1990s, when KLUC heavily played the boy bands that were popular during that era. KLUC has long been recognized as an industry leader, having won numerous awards as \"Station Of The Year\" in the US from Billboard, Gavin, Radio & Records and S.I.N. KLUC was the first station in the Las Vegas market to achieve over 500,000 weekly listeners and still holds the title year after year as \"The Most Listened To Radio Station In Nevada.\"\n\nUp until 1978 they simulcasted with sister station 1140 AM.

That all changed in April 2014 when both monitored trades moved KLUC to the Top 40/CHR panel as CBS Radio has begun converting their CHR formatted station to a model based on the \"AMP\" brand. This leaves KSFM Sacramento, California as the only CBS Radio outlet in the West Coast that is still a Rhythmic Top 40.\n\n"}

'This Is Not A Riot' featured samples of crowd chants recorded at various demonstrations around the world, as well as the sampling of the LRAD Long Range Acoustic Device riot control sonic weapon.\n\nThe track received national UK radio airplay on BBC Radio 1 with Rob Da Bank calling it \"revolutionary rave\". and went on to be referenced as \"riot-folk\" by the world renown monthly magazine \"Fortean Times\" which officially acknowledged the track as the first-ever musical work to feature the LRAD.\n\nJune 2010 saw the release of single 'Daytime Radio Hit', ironically named due to the inclusion of the expletive-laden guest vocals of Holly from The New York Chimes which resulted in the only radio airplay coming from longtime supporter John Kennedy on XFM with an exclusively created 'bleeped' version. Dance press reviews continued to be highly positive, with iDJ calling it \"jaunty electro boogie\" and DJ Mag citing it as \"an aptly-named DFA-style grooveathon.\"\n\nThe second IDC album 'The Sun Is Always Shining Above The Clouds' was released in August 2011. Mixmag wrote \"IDC is back with a rich and diverse album made across five studios over 18 months\" and DJ Mag called it \"a brilliant work\" giving a rating of 9 out of 10.\n\n\"Eins Deux Tres\" was the lead single from the album and it was awarded 'Tune of the Month' in Mixmag describing it as \"a beautifully compelling collage of Beach Boys-like vocal harmonies and electronic voices.

{"id": "2023355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2023355", "title": "London Bridge (Lake Havasu City)", "text": "London Bridge (Lake Havasu City)\n\nLondon Bridge is a bridge in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. It was built in the 1830s and formerly spanned the River Thames in London, England. It was dismantled in 1967 and relocated to Arizona. The Arizona bridge is a reinforced concrete structure clad in the original masonry of the 1830s bridge, which was purchased by Robert P. McCulloch from the City of London. McCulloch had exterior granite blocks from the original bridge numbered and transported to America to construct the present bridge in Lake Havasu City, a planned community he established in 1964 on the shore of Lake Havasu. The bridge was completed in 1971 (along with a canal), and links an island in the Colorado River with the main part of Lake Havasu City.\n\nThe 1831 London Bridge was the last project of engineer John Rennie and was completed by his son, John Rennie the Younger. By 1962, the bridge was not sound enough to support the increased load of traffic, and it was sold by the City of London.\n\nThe purchaser, Robert P. McCulloch, the chairman of McCulloch Oil Corporation, was the founder of Lake Havasu City, his retirement real estate development on the east shore of Lake Havasu, a large reservoir on the Colorado River. McCulloch purchased the bridge as a tourist attraction for Lake Havasu, which was then far from the usual tourist track. The idea was successful, bringing interested tourists and retirement home buyers to the area.\n\nIt is a popular rumor that the bridge was bought in the belief that it was London's more recognizable Tower Bridge, but this was ardently denied by McCulloch himself and by Ivan Luckin, who sold the bridge.\n\nOriginally, the deserted Lake Havasu vacant land was given to the state of Arizona by the U.S. Federal Government. The federal property was an abandoned military landing strip. McCulloch made a deal with the state government and received the property for free with a promise to develop the land. But the real estate agents could not bring in prospective buyers, because the land was far from centers of population and had a very hot, arid climate. McCulloch's real estate agent, Robert Plumer, learned that London Bridge was for sale and convinced McCulloch to buy it and bring it to the area to attract potential land buyers. The initial response from McCulloch was, \"That's the craziest idea I have ever heard,\" but after consideration, he decided to go ahead and purchased it for $2.46m (£1.78m). Plumer then arranged with a cargo shipping company that was going to sail a newly-built ship from Great Britain to the United States without any cargo. Plumer said they would pay for all operating costs of the sailing, which was far less than the going rate shipping costs. The bridge's facing stones were disassembled, and each was numbered. After the bridge was dismantled, it was transported to Merrivale Quarry where were sliced off many of the original stones. The bridge arrived in pieces at the Port of Long Beach, California and was transported overland to Lake Havasu City, where re-assembly began in 1968. On 23 September 1968, the foundation stone was relaid by Sir Gilbert Inglefield, Lord Mayor of London.\n\nThe original stonework was used to clad a new concrete structure. The reconstruction took slightly over three years and was completed in late 1971. The bridge was not reconstructed over a river, but rather it was rebuilt on land in a position between the main part of the city and Pittsburgh Point, at that time a peninsula jutting into Lake Havasu. Once completed, the Bridgewater Channel Canal was dredged under the bridge and flooded, separating Pittsburgh Point from the city, creating an island. As a result, the bridge now traverses a navigable shortcut between the Thompson Bay part of Lake Havasu south of Pittsburgh Point, and the remainder of Lake Havasu to the north.\n\nAfter the bridge was reconstructed, prospective buyers of land were attracted to visit the bridge and take a tour of properties for sale. Land sales improved, and McCulloch recouped all his expenses on the purchase and shipping of the bridge. Since he had obtained the land at no cost, the sale of the properties paid for the bridge and more. Recent years have seen much development in the area of the bridge to increase tourist interest. The original \"English Village\", a quaint English-style open-air mall with hedge maze and historical museum deteriorated, with sections leveled. A revitalization of the English Village was undertaken by the Lake Havasu City Convention & Visitors Bureau. Condos were proposed in 2011 by the owner, Virtual Realty Enterprises.\n\n\n"}

It has become a popular ornamental garden plant. It is a herbaceous biennial or short-lived perennial plant growing to 13–92 cm tall, with flowers in a dense cluster of up to 30 at the top of the stems. Each flower is 2–3 cm diameter with five petals displaying serrated edges. Wild plants produce red flowers with a white base, but colours in cultivars range from white, pink, red, and purple to variegated patterns. The exact origin of its English common name is unknown but first appears in 1596 in botanist John Gerard's garden catalogue. The flowers are edible and may have medicinal properties. Sweet William attracts bees, birds, and butterflies.\n\nSweet William grows in the mountains of southern Europe from the Pyrenees east to the Carpathians and the Balkans, with a variety disjunct in northeastern China, Korea, and southeasternmost Russia. It grows to 13–92 cm tall (depending on the variety), with green to glaucous blue-green tapered leaves 4–10 cm long and 1–2 cm broad. The flowers are produced in a dense cluster of up to 30 at the top of the stems (known as an umbel) and have a spicy, clove-like scent; each flower is 2–3 cm diameter with five petals with serrated edges; in wild plants the petals are red with a white base.\n\nThere are two varieties:\n\nMany legends purport to explain how sweet William acquired its English common name, but none is verified. It is often said to honour the 18th century Prince William, Duke of Cumberland. As a result of the Duke's victory at the Battle of Culloden and his generally brutal treatment of the king's enemies, it is also claimed that the Scots sometimes call the flower \"stinking Billy\". Though this makes a nice story, it is entirely untrue. The Scots sometimes refer to the noxious ragwort as stinking Billy in memory of the infamous Duke. Phillips speculated that the flower was named after Gerard's contemporary, William Shakespeare. It is also said to be named after Saint William of York or after William the Conqueror. Another etymological derivation is that \"william\" is a corruption of the French \"oeillet\", meaning both \"carnation\" and \"little eye\". Sweet William is a favourite name for lovelorn young men in English folkloric ballads, e.g., \"Fair Margaret and Sweet William\".\n\nSweet William is a popular ornamental plant in gardens, with numerous cultivars and hybrids selected for differing flower colour, ranging from white, pink, red, and purple to variegated patterns.\n\nThe plant was introduced to northern Europe in the 16th century, and later to North America and elsewhere, and has become locally to widely naturalised in these areas.\n\nJohn Gerard praises its beauty but omits any reference to medicinal uses. Its height makes it convenient for flower arrangements. In the Victorian language of flowers, sweet william symbolizes gallantry. The plant is widely used in borders, rock gardens and informal country cottage style gardens. Sweet William is a good candidate for a naturalistic garden because its nectar attracts birds, bees, and butterflies. Its flowers are considered edible.\nSweet Williams is a family of dianthus.\nIt thrives in loamy, slightly alkaline soil with sun to partial shade. Propagation is by seed, cuttings, or division, but seeds of cultivars will not breed true. If it is planted from seed after the last frost, it will flower in the second year. If it is planted in flats before the last frost and then transplanted, it may flower in the first year. Some gardeners recommend deadheading to encourage further flowering. The plant is self-seeding. Sweet William can suffer from Fusarium Wilt which causes the leaves to curl or droop down.\n\nIn 1977 the question of possible medical uses was revisited by Cordell. Saponins were found in Sweet William, but there has been little follow-up.\n\nAt the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011, Catherine Middleton included Sweet William in her bouquet, a tribute to her bridegroom.\n"}

WCLR aired a beautiful music format through 1975. WCLR played approximately 75% instrumentals, along with contemporary easy listening vocals and a few standards. In 1971, the station's transmitter was moved to the John Hancock Center, and in 1974 its transmitter was moved to the Sears Tower.\n\nIn 1975, the station shifted to middle of the road (MOR) format, with an 80/20 vocal to instrumental ratio, in contrast to its previous strong emphasis on instrumental music.

Sanidine is found most typically in felsic volcanic rocks such as obsidian, rhyolite and trachyte. Sanidine crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system. Orthoclase is a monoclinic polymorph stable at lower temperatures. At yet lower temperatures, microcline, a triclinic polymorph of potassium feldspar, is stable.\n\nDue to the high temperature and rapid quenching, sanidine can contain more sodium in its structure than the two polymorphs that equilibrated at lower temperatures. Sanidine and high albite constitute a solid solution series with intermediate compositions termed anorthoclase. Exsolution of an albite phase does occur; resulting cryptoperthite can best be observed in electron microprobe images.\n\n"}

It won the 1972 Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 45th Academy Awards in March 1973. After the film's release, it was recorded by Maureen McGovern and became a hit single for her following its release in May 1973. It was a number-one hit in the US for two weeks during August 1973, and became a Gold record. \"Billboard\" ranked it as the No. 28 song for 1973.\n\nThe song was written in March 1972 by 20th Century Fox songwriters Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn, who were asked to write the love theme for \"The Poseidon Adventure\" in one night. The finished product was called \"Why Must There Be a Morning After?\" but changes by the record label resulted in the song's more optimistic lyric of \"there's got to be a morning after\". In the end titles of the film, it is called \"The Song from \"The Poseidon Adventure\"\", though it would become best known by the title of the single, \"The Morning After\".\n\nThe song is performed in the film by the character of Nonnie, played by Carol Lynley, but is actually sung by a vocal double, Renee Armand. It appears twice, during a warm-up rehearsal and then later during the New Year's Eve party early in the film. The lyrics relate to the themes of the film, as a band of passengers survive the capsizing of the ship SS \"Poseidon\" and have to escape the sinking wreck.\n\n\n\n"}

He spent his early years living in the countryside of Wales. Leaving school at 17, he returned to London and set about finding a drumming job in the booming blues scene. After a fruitless 22 months he was resigned to returning to the country when he met Paul Kossoff who was playing in a band called Black Cat Bones. Kirke was offered the drumming position in the band for which he played for six months.\n\nKirke and Paul Kossoff left the band and with Paul Rodgers and Andy Fraser formed Free. In the four years Free were together they had an enormous influence on many bands on both sides of the Atlantic. Their biggest hit, \"All Right Now\", was a number one in more than 20 territories and was acknowledged by ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers) in 1990 as having received more than 1,000,000 radio plays in the US by late 1989. In 2000 an award was given to Paul Rodgers by the British music industry when \"All Right Now\" passed 2,000,000 radio plays in the UK.\n\nBy April 1972 Free had reformed with Andy Fraser and Paul Rodgers making peace, and Kossoff appeared to pull it together if only briefly. Kossoff resumed taking drugs during the US tour to support the last album by the original quartet \"Free at Last\". On the eve of their Japanese tour Fraser fought with Rodgers and once again left the band, to be replaced by Tetsu Yamauchi. Rodgers and Kirke elected to fill in the band bringing John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick on board as a member of Free for the tour and the last Free album \"Heartbreaker\". After the disbanding of Free in 1973, Kirke and Rodgers again teamed up to form Bad Company. They were joined by guitarist Mick Ralphs (Mott the Hoople) and bassist Boz Burrell (King Crimson).\n\nAfter Bad Company disbanded in 1982, Kirke joined a band called Wildlife. They toured in support of the Michael Schenker Group around this time in the UK. Wildlife's self-titled album was mostly written by Steve and Chris Overland, produced by former Bad Company bandmate Ralphs, and featured Kirke as their drummer (and saxophonist on his self-written song \"Charity\"). Despite being signed to Led Zeppelin's label, Swan Song Records, and Kirke's high-profile involvement, the album failed to sell. Wildlife's core members, brothers Chris and Steve Overland went on to greater success with the band FM.\n\nKirke returned to Bad Company when the band reformed in 1986. As well as touring with Ringo Starr's All Star Band on three occasions, he is an accomplished songwriter, releasing \"Seven Rays of Hope\" in 2005. He toured with Bad Company in 2009. He has been playing with New York City rock band Zeta Vang as a side project.\n\nA governor on the board of NARAS (the Grammy Award Committee), Kirke is on the board of Road Recovery, which helps teenagers recover from addiction. He lives in Manhattan, he has four children: Domino, Jemima, Lola, Simon Jr. and (step-son) Greg.\n\nKirke currently uses dw drums, Paiste cymbals, and Promark drumsticks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located near the villages of Cong 4 km to the south-west, Cross 4 km to the south and the town of Ballinrobe about 5 km to the north.\n\nA number of archaeological sites and ruins surround the village, dating from prehistoric times to the Middle Ages. These include cairns, stone circles, raths, ringforts and crannogs.\n\nThe surrounding landscape also has a number of ruined Norman castles previously occupied by the McDonnell mercenaries. Adjacent to The Neale village is the home of the first Englishman to settle in the country – sheriff and map maker – John Browne.\nThe Neale village also hosted the \"uncrowned king of Ireland\", Charles Stewart Parnell, and Michael Davitt during the Land League era. The system of organised ostracisation of over bearing landlords and agents – later termed Boycotting by Fr. John O'Malley (Parish priest in The Neale), was first put into operation at Lough Mask House where Captain Charles Boycott attempted to raise the rents. Journalists from all over Europe and America converged on the tiny village to witness the non-violent resistance movement.\n\nIn October 2012, the Neale GAA Junior team became the first team within the club to win the County Mayo Junior Club Championship beating an Ardnaree team by 2–09 to 1–17 after extra time at MacHale Park in Castlebar. Having played Junior status for the previous 110 years, the Neale were then promoted to Intermediate level for the first time in 2013. In October 2019, the club claimed the County Intermediate Title for the first time, beating Ballyhaunis 1–12 to 1–11 in a closed final played in Castlebar.\n\nThe Pyramid of The Neale is an architectural folly build in the form of a step pyramid around 1760. Listed on the Record of Protected Structures for County Mayo, it is a 30-foot structure rising from a series of steps from the base nearly 40 feet in width. John Kilmaine of Alcester, England provides the following information on the structure: \"It is said that the pyramid is constructed on the old tumulus. The building of the pyramid is attributed to Sir John Browne the 7th Baronet and 1st Baron of Kilmaine, in memory of his brother, Sir George Browne. The structure, which at one time was crowned by a lead figure of Apollo, was designed by the Earl of Charlemont for his brother in law, Sir John Browne, The Neale\". There are a few varying stories of the building of the Pyramid. One such story is that Lord Kilmaine was anxious to find a way of relieving the extreme poverty of his tenants in the post famine years, so he employed several men to pick up the stones around the estate. He had those stones piled up and built into a pyramid. This provided the poor people with a little additional income. In the later years a wind-vane adorned the top of the pyramid, so the landlord could indulge in his passion for meteorology and the recording of weather systems over a period of 30 years. The Office of Public Works refurbished the Pyramid in 1990.\n\nTemple Monument It was in the 18th century that the Penal Laws were enforced and the great houses and estates of the landlords were built . The Neale estate was approximately 400 acres, and was surrounded by a high double wall. Inside the wall, the landlord built a number of unusual monuments or follies. The Temple is an unfinished temple of carved stone. It was the last folly to be built in 1865 by John Browne, Baron of Kilmaine in honour of his first title Lord Mount Temple. It is hexagonal and has 6 plain Doric columns, at one time it had a timber roof. The base of the Temple, with the arches. Dates from an earlier time and it is probable that the columns were replaced on top of the old structure to give it elevation. The Temple was used by the ladies of the Big House for family meetings, knitting and relaxing. In addition to relaxing at the Temple, the ladies also walked \"The Cavendish Walks\", both inside and outside the estate.\n\nGods Of The Neale About 200 yards east of The Neale village, inside the old demesne wall and close to the ruins of Lord Kilmaine's house, is a stone monument that is known as The Gods of The Neale. A collection of stone slabs with carvings of three mythical figures, a griffin, a unicorn and an angel is enshrined in a stone structure. The inscription refers to the sculptured figures as Deithe Feile, Diana Ffeale, and \"The Gods of The Neale, from which The Neale gets its name\". Among other mythological characters mentioned in the inscription is Loo Lave Adda (Lú Lamhfhada) whose hand is reputed to be buried under a nearby \"Long Stone\".\n\nThe Long Stone The Lia Lugha (Stone of Lu) is said to mark the burial place of Lugh Lamhfhada (Lu of the Long Hand) who was slain in the Battle of Moyturna. Lu was the son of Nuadha, King of the Tuatha De Danann. The stone is at the fork of the roads from Cross and from \nCong, south of the Neale village. It is known locally as the Long Stone\n\nFacilities and services in the area include Mellottes grocery shop and bar, and the adjoining Pyramid restaurant. Also nearby is Gibbons Bar which is a traditional Irish pub with a thatched roof. Gibbons Bar has been listed on the Record of Protected Structures by Mayo County Council.\n\nSt John the Baptist Church & Calvary is in the centre of the village, built in 1875, the foundation for which, was laid by Rev Fr. O'Malley. Fr. O'Malley Millennium Park was named in honour of Fr. John O'Malley for his role with the Land League movement. He built the old Neale school in 1883 and the existing church in 1875. A monument was erected from the stone from the old school and church in 2000.\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 7, 1997. The episode sees Marge becoming a real estate agent, while Homer enjoys Snake's car. It was written by Dan Greaney and directed by Swinton O. Scott III.\n\nThis episode has the final speaking appearance of Lionel Hutz, five months before the death of Phil Hartman. The episode's development grew out of a desire by the writers to do a show focused on Marge, where her job did not work out. \n\nThe episode received positive mention in the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", and is featured in the special 2003 DVD release \"The Simpsons: Risky Business\".\n\nHomer drags Marge to a police seized-property auction. While there, he buys Snake's car, the Li'l Bandit. Upon seeing this, Snake vows to kill Homer. After the auction, Marge encounters Lionel Hutz, who has become a realtor. Marge decides to try the job for herself and begins to work for Hutz at Red Blazer Realty. She tells prospective buyers her honest opinion about the houses she shows them.\n\nDue to her honesty, Marge does not sell any homes. Hutz informs her to use more positive descriptions when selling the houses, and also informs Marge if she does not sell a house in the first week, she will be fired. Marge tries to bend the truth, but fails as she just cannot lie to others. Marge does not disclose the entire truth of the house she sells to Ned Flanders and his family, which had been the site of a multiple homicide. The Flanders purchase the house and bid farewell to the Simpsons.\n\nMeanwhile, Snake escapes from the prison and jumps into the Li'l Bandit to retrieve the car from Homer. They start fighting each other to gain control of the moving car, and Chief Wiggum starts chasing them.\n\nFeeling guilty about her deception and concerned for the Flanders' safety, Marge goes to check on them at their new house. There, she tells them the truth about the murders, but they are not annoyed. Ned and Maude are pleased to be a part of Springfield's history, and refuse Marge's offer of returning the deposit. Unfortunately, the house is destroyed seconds later when Li'l Bandit and Wiggum's police car crash through the house. Marge returns Flanders' down payment. Hutz, annoyed at the damage costs and especially by the return of the money, fires Marge (giving her a Red Blazer embroidered with this information). At the end of the episode, Homer takes Marge to the government unemployment office to collect a welfare check.\n\nThe writers wanted to do a \"Marge episode\", but one where her job does not work out, unlike previous episodes. The episode marks the first appearance of Gil Gunderson, voiced by Dan Castellaneta, and Cookie Kwan, voiced by Tress MacNeille. Excuses were made by the writers to bring back Gil in future episodes based on Castellaneta's performance at the table read, which proved popular with the staff. Snake's prison number is 7F20, the production code of \"The War of the Simpsons\", the episode in which he first appeared.\n\nThe piano wire scene was meant to end with Kirk's sandwich being sliced just the way he wanted, until George Meyer suggested that his arm be cut off instead. Mike Scully described the ensuing laughter at his suggestion as the most intense he had ever heard from the staff, saying: \"They were literally choking because the joke was so unexpected. It was a shocked kind of laugh, and it just started rolling, one of those laughs that build the more they reverberate through you.\" In the unemployment line, the unemployment recipient with the bucket hat and the beard is a caricature of George Meyer. Due to Phil Hartman's death, the recurring characters of Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure were retired. As such, this episode is the last speaking appearance of Hutz, with him only being featured as a background character in some future episodes. McClure's final appearance would be in \"Bart the Mother\", the third episode of season ten. The character of Gil being created as a semi replacement for Hutz as the Simpson's lawyer.\n\nThe title of the episode is an allusion to the 1994 movie \"Reality Bites\". Gil Gunderson is based on Jack Lemmon's portrayal of Shelley Levene in the 1992 film \"Glengarry Glen Ross\".\n\nWhen Homer drives by Snake for the first time in the convertible he sings, \"My name is Luka, and I live on the second floor.\" The lyrics are from the hit song \"Luka\" by Suzanne Vega. \n\nAt one point in the episode, Snake sets up a wire across a road to decapitate Homer as he drives by. The wire is supplied by \"Acme\", after the brand of equipment used by Wile E. Coyote to try and stop Road Runner in the Looney Tunes cartoons. \n\nWhen Ned Flanders explains to Marge that they were painting Todd's room red, Todd starts saying \"Red room, red room\" and moves his finger, like the character of Danny does in the film \"The Shining\".\n\nWhen Lionel Hutz reads the list of wrecked items to Marge, it is a tribute to the \"Lethal Weapon\" movies. \n\nThe newspaper front page reporting the \"Jealous Jockey Murders\" carries the statement \"Mrs. Astor safe\" beneath the headline. This is a reference to the front page of \"The New York Times\" on April 15, 1912, reporting the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\" three days earlier whilst assuring that \"Ismay safe, Mrs. Astor maybe\".\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Realty Bites\" finished 21st in ratings for the week of December 1–7, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 10.8, equivalent to approximately 10.6 million viewing households. It was the third-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\" and \"King of the Hill\".\n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\" said, \"A simple but enjoyable romp, with the final few minutes in the Murder House particularly funny. Best thing though is the introduction of the hapless Gil, destined to always be a ray of light in any episode!\" \n\nThe episode is featured in a special 2003 DVD compilation called \"The Simpsons: Risky Business\", along with \"Marge Gets a Job\", \"Deep Space Homer\", and \"Homer the Smithers\".\n\n"}
