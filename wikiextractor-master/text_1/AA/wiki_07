It is located north of the Melbourne CBD, Victoria, Australia, in the suburb of Parkville.\n\nMany sporting facilities are provided including the North Park Tennis Club, Royal Park Golf Course, football and soccer ovals, baseball and cricket es, State Netball & Hockey Centre, and cycling and walking paths. On the corner of Gatehouse Street and Royal Parade there is a native garden. There are wide vistas of grassland and lightly timbered areas with eucalypts, casuarina, and acacias. The Melbourne City Council administers the park and instituted in 1984 a park management plan. A wetlands area was developed in 2005.\n\nThe grassy hill between the Royal Children's Hospital and the Native Garden is ideal for kite flying during the day. Over the summer months, members of the Astronomical Society of Victoria set up telescopes and conduct evening talks and tours of the night sky from this vantage point.\n\nThe park is home to many native animals such as possums, and a rich variety of birdlife which includes: Pacific black duck, chestnut teal, white-faced heron, brown goshawk, collared sparrowhawk, Horsfield's bronze cuckoo, Australian hobby, galah, red-rumped parrot, eastern rosella, superb fairy-wren, white-plumed honeyeater, spotted pardalote, white-browed scrubwren, grey fantail and red-browed finch.\n\nThe park is home to a regionally significant population of White's skink (\"Egernia whitii\") and a section of habitat is maintained specifically for this species.\n\nIn the early years of European settlement Wurundjeri campfires were sometimes seen in the vicinity of Royal Park, although the \"Yarra people\" generally preferred camping beside the Yarra River or Merri Creek.\n\nGovernor Charles La Trobe set aside in 1845 a reservation of for parkland and open space, however, by the time of its proclamation in 1854 this had been reduced to a reserve of . This was further reduced to with the rapid increase of population from the Victorian gold rush, to form the suburb of Parkville from three new residential areas, Parkville North, South and West. In 1861 the Royal Melbourne Zoological Gardens was allocated . Further excisions followed for roads, tramline and the Upfield railway line; University High School (1929), Royal Melbourne Hospital (1944), Royal Children's Hospital (1957), Royal Dental Hospital (1963).\n\nIn 1860 the Burke and Wills expedition set out from Royal Park to cross Australia from south to north. They perished on the return journey. A cairn now marks the departure point of their expedition in Royal Park.\n\nThe park was used for military encampments during World War One and Two, with Camp Pell being used by United States forces during the Second World War. After the war, the permanent buildings of Camp Pell were used for emergency housing accommodation until 1960. As of 2005, the one existing building from Camp Pell is used as an 'Urban Camp' to provide accommodation for rural school children and other groups when visiting Melbourne.\n\nFollowing many years of agitation by resident groups and various failed planning attempts, the Melbourne City Council held a design competition in 1984, judged by representatives of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects, Royal Australian Institute of Parks and Recreation, Melbourne University's School of Environmental Planning, and the Melbourne City Council.\n\nThe winning entry by landscape architects Brian Stafford and Ronald Jones expressed a philosophy that the character of the Park was inherent in its form – 'a place where the earth swells, the dome of the sky soars overhead and the horizon beckons'. A sense of the landscape at the time of Europeans’ first encounter with it was to be evoked by planting indigenous species and enhancing the park's spacious quality, principally through a process of 'editing' rather than adding new features. The aim was 'to provide a park for persons rather than machinery, for individual public activity rather than restricted private institutions, and for psychological recreation as well as physical activity'.\n\nThe plan proposed extensive planting of indigenous trees, while the expansive hilltop in the park's south-east was to be cleared and planted with native grasses. A network of walking and cycle paths was proposed, along with works to reduce the impact of traffic and parking, including closing through roads, rebuilding a large section of Macarthur Road as a tunnel, and reorganising car parks.\n\nThe plan was greeted with consternation. Sporting groups were concerned with a potential loss of facilities; the Zoo administration wanted more parking rather than any attempt at control; there was concern for maintenance of motor routes; and The Age highlighted the intent to 'rip out' exotic trees. Council adopted the Master Plan – in principle and subject to various qualifications – after three years of debate.\n\nThe first works to implement the plan were completed in the early 1990s. Two new ovals were graded near Flemington Road to allow removal of the sports grounds, changing room and car park perched on the hilltop in the park's south-east, which now has uncluttered views of Melbourne's skyline. A new pond was formed, featuring rockwork by the landscape designer Gordon Ford.\n\nA new layout for access and parking around the Zoo was finally agreed upon after a decade of negotiation between the Council and Zoo. Reorganization of the car parks, closure of various roads, development of forecourts to the zoo's main entry and extensive new plantings were completed in 1997.\n\nA formal review of the Master Plan commenced in 1996. This included extensive public consultation that identified overwhelming support for the principles established by the winning entry in the 1984 Royal Park Master Plan Design Competition. The Master Plan as reviewed endorsed the objectives of the 1984 document and introduced proposals such as a major wetland water recycling project west of the railway line. It was approved by Council in November 1997.\n\nIn 2003 the Labor Government of Steve Bracks selected the former Royal Park Psychiatric Hospital site, bordering on Moonee Ponds Creek and in the neighbourhood of Royal Park (but not in the park), for the athletes village for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. After the games, the site developers, Australand and Citta Property Group, sold the housing. Opponents of the village criticised the building of the village citing the destruction of more than 1000 trees, demolition of 4 of the hospital buildings pending a heritage listing, and denigration of the heritage value of the remaining buildings, a lost opportunity to return a development back to public parkland, and privatisation of public lands.\n\nSporting groups criticised security arrangements for the athletes' village with large sections of the park and sporting grounds having security fencing erected for the exclusive use of athletes. This disrupted many community sporting associations from their regular use of sporting facilities.\n\nIn 2005 the Bracks Labor Government selected an adjacent site in Royal Park to build a new Royal Children's Hospital. Sections of the old hospital were demolished and restored to parklands.\n\nWhile the move attracted some opposition from green groups, it was promoted with the claim that there would be no net loss of parkland at Royal Park. The basis of area calculations used to support this claim is unclear. Relocation of the Hospital's helipad onto the roof of the new building has removed this impact from the park, but after completion of construction, it appears that the hospital buildings now occupy a substantially larger area than previously, and parkland has been lost.\n\n\nRoyal Park is also home to the State Netball & Hockey Centre, which hosts games in the top flight trans-Tasman netball competition and international hockey matches, Royal Park Golf Club - notable for being the place where one of Australian golfing's greatest champions, Peter Thomson, first learnt his craft - as well as several tennis clubs, and large areas of open space for less structured recreational activities.\n\nThe Upfield railway line travels through Royal Park with Royal Park station being a convenient stop for the Melbourne Zoo.\n\nA light rail for trams runs through the park, which is served by route 58 to both West Coburg and Toorak.\n\nThe route 19 tram runs up Royal Parade, to the east of the park, which operates northbound to North Coburg, and southbound to Flinders Street station.\n\nTwo tram routes also run up Flemington Road, to the west of the park. The routes 57 and 59 operate in a northbound direction to West Maribyrnong and Airport West respectively. Both routes operate to Flinders Street station in a southbound direction.\n\nThe Capital City Trail for cyclists follows the train line through Royal Park from the Moonee Ponds Creek Trail at Flemington Bridge, past Melbourne Zoo, and under Royal Parade along the converted Inner Circle railway line to Princes Park.\n\n"}

Minto died in the line of duty, killed by an escaped inmate.\n\nHarry Minto was born in Salem, Oregon, in 1864, the son of Oregon pioneer John Minto, for whom Salem's Minto-Brown Island Park was named. In 1890, Minto was married to Jessie Glenn (b. 1870 Salem, Oregon; d. 1956 Tampa, Florida). Minto was chief of police for the Salem, Oregon police department from 1891 to 1895 and he served two terms as the Marion County sheriff. He was elected sheriff in 1908, and served through 1913. His older brother, John Wilson Minto, was previously the sheriff as well as chief of police in Portland.\n\nIn 1914, Minto was appointed as the Superintendent of the Oregon State Penitentiary by governor Oswald West. He replaced Berton K. Lawson, who had been involved in the events at Copperfield, Oregon early that year. As warden, he supervised the infamous serial killer Carl Panzram, in June 1915, when Panzram still was in his early twenties and before his known murderings.\n\nWarden Harry Minto believed in harsh treatment of inmates, including beatings and isolation, among other disciplinary measures. On September 27, 1915, inmate Otto Hooker escaped from a work gang at the prison and Minto was one of many law enforcement personnel who went searching for the escaped prisoner. After Hooker shot and wounded one law enforcement officer, Minto caught up with Hooker near Albany around 11:30 pm. There Minto challenged Hooker, and Hooker shot Minto in the head, killing him instantly. Hooker was mortally wounded the next day during capture. Minto’s remains were cremated in Portland, Oregon. Hooker's accomplice, Carl Panzram, was executed in 1930 for killing a prison employee at the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth.\n\n"}

Using carefully chosen test vectors, this can be done much faster than an exhaustive search of all combinations of all parameters, by \"parallelizing\" the tests of parameter pairs.\n\nThe most common bugs in a program are generally triggered by either a single input parameter or an interaction between pairs of parameters. Bugs involving interactions between three or more parameters are both progressively less common and also progressively more expensive to find---such testing has as its limit the testing of all possible inputs. Thus, a combinatorial technique for picking test cases like all-pairs testing is a useful cost-benefit compromise that enables a significant reduction in the number of test cases without drastically compromising functional coverage.\n\nMore rigorously, if we assume that a test case has formula_1 parameters given in a set formula_2.\nThe range of the parameters are given by formula_3.\nLet's assume that formula_4.\nWe note that the number of all possible test cases is a formula_5. Imagining that the code deals with the conditions taking only two parameters at a time, might reduce the number of needed test cases.\n\nTo demonstrate, suppose there are X,Y,Z parameters.\nWe can use a predicate of the form formula_6 of order 3, which takes all 3 as input, or rather three different order 2 predicates of the form formula_7. formula_8 can be written in an equivalent form of formula_9 where comma denotes any combination. If the code is written as conditions taking \"pairs\" of parameters,\nthen the set of choices of ranges formula_10 can be a multiset, because there can be multiple parameters having same number of choices.\n\nformula_11 is one of the maximum of the multiset formula_12\nThe number of pair-wise test cases on this test function would be:-\nformula_13\n\nTherefore, if the formula_14 and formula_15 then the number of tests is typically O(\"nm\"), where \"n\" and \"m\" are the number of possibilities for each of the two parameters with the most choices, and it can be quite a lot less than the exhaustive formula_5·\n\nN-wise testing can be considered the generalized form of pair-wise testing.\n\nThe idea is to apply sorting to the set formula_10 so that formula_18 gets ordered too.\nLet the sorted set be a formula_1 tuple :-\n\nformula_20\n\nNow we can take the set formula_21 and call it the pairwise testing.\nGeneralizing further we can take the set formula_22 and call it the 3-wise testing.\nEventually, we can say formula_23 T-wise testing.\n\nThe N-wise testing then would just be, all possible combinations from the above formula.\n\nConsider the parameters shown in the table below.\n\n'Enabled', 'Choice Type' and 'Category' have a choice range of 2, 3 and 4, respectively. An exhaustive test would involve 24 tests (2 x 3 x 4). Multiplying the two largest values (3 and 4) indicates that a pair-wise tests would involve 12 tests. The pict tool generated pairwise test cases is shown below.\n\n\n"}

Donald Ewen Cameron became president of the World Psychiatric Association at its formal founding in 1961.\n\nIn February 1983, the Soviet All-Union Society of Neurologists and Psychiatrists resigned from the World Psychiatric Association. This resignation occurred as a preemptive action amid a movement to expel the Soviet body from the global organization due to political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. The Soviet body was conditionally readmitted into the World Psychiatric Association in 1989, following some improvements in human rights conditions, and an intensive debate among the association's delegates, in which the acting secretary of the Soviet delegation issued a statement conceding that \"previous political conditions in the U.S.S.R. created an environment in which psychiatric abuse occurred, including for nonmedical reasons.\"\n\n the institutional members of the World Psychiatric Association are 138 national psychiatric societies in 118 countries representing more than 200,000 psychiatrists worldwide.

The name 'Soribada' means \"Ocean of Sound\" or \"Receiving (downloading) Sound\". It was closed in 2002 by court order but continued to be distributed with a stipulation that its users were responsible for any of the files downloaded.\nOn November 5, 2003, Soribada was relaunched as and in July 2004, the website was renewed as a P2P search portal with a paid MP3 service in December 2004.\n\nIt remains the most widely used P2P system in Korea. The most recent version of Soribada is Soribada 6, which is downloadable on their website.\n\nIn 2017, the site held their first Soribada Best K-Music Awards, after 17 years since the site's launch.\n\nSoribada was indicted on copyright infringement charges for the first time. The case was filed by the Korean Association of Phonographic Producers (KAPP), presently the Recording Industry Association of Korea (RIAK).\n\nSoribada 2.0 allowed users to swap files without having to establish a link to a centralized server. This mechanism was put in place in order to minimize the risk of legal prosecution. However, KAPP's reply to this solution was that every Soribada 2.0-user was sued instead of the developers. Yang Jung-hwan responded to KAPP's approach by saying, “In a situation where voluminous e-mail services handling over 100MB are being sustained, netizens will find other ways to share music files even with Soribada out of the market.”\n\nFrom December 2004 to June 2005, Soribada sold nearly 5 million songs through its servers. Searches returned both tracks for sale and free downloads, with the first ones appearing higher on search results.\n\nUpon being sued again, Soribada stopped its service in 2005. Yang Jung-hwan and his brother Il-hwan, the creators of Soribada, faced criminal charges in January 2005. A complete shutdown of Soribada has been ordered by the Seoul High Court which suggested that the site has encouraged users to commit copyright violations.\n\nSoribada Inc. settled with record labels and copyright owners in early 2006, and it turned into a commercial music download service in July 2006.

{"id": "1799114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799114", "title": "Alban Towers", "text": "Alban Towers\n\nAlban Towers is an apartment building on Massachusetts Avenue in Northwest Washington, D.C. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, and is considered to be one of the best examples of Gothic Revival architecture in Washington.\n\nIt is located at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue (Embassy Row) and Wisconsin Avenue, and occupies the 221,000 square foot (21,000 m²) block between those two avenues and Garfield Street, Cathedral Avenue, and 38th Street. Diagonally across the Massachusetts-Wisconsin intersection is the St. Albans School, which occupies the southwestern corner of the grounds of the Washington National Cathedral.\n\nThe land Alban Towers is situated on was purchased by its developer from the Washington National Cathedral in the early 1920s. It opened in 1929 as the largest apartment building in Washington, D.C. By today's standards, however, it is modest in size at six stories tall.\n\nIts prominent architect/developer team, Robert O. Scholz, designer, David A. Baer, builder, designed the building in the Gothic Revival with tan-colored brick and limestone employed to simulate the monochrome composition of Gothic style architecture; popular in the 1920s and because it would complement the Washington National Cathedral. (Together Scholz & Baer were responsible for the construction of at least eight apartment buildings between the years 1922 and 1931. As a result, they earned a reputation as one of the more important apartment house architect/developer teams of the post-World War I decade. Representing the product of the collaboration, both whom specialized in 1920s apartment building construction, Alban Towers reflects the work of notable planners and architects who influenced the evolution of apartment construction in Washington, D.C.)\n\nThe lobbies and hallways, with their richly ornamented Gothic/Art Deco elements, were integral to the exterior scheme. Paved in quarry tiles of brown, orange, and ocher laid in a geometric pattern, the lobby is topped by plaster crown molding composed of rope and infilled with alternating roses, acorns, and thistles. These symbols of Great Britain serve to reinforce the English Gothic tenor of the building. The walls of the upper-floor hallways are covered in rough-finished stucco, lending a “sumptuous texture that is rarely found in apartment buildings.”\n\nBilled as an apartment hotel, Alban Towers offered its residents 24-hour maid service and a public dining room. Indeed, on the ground floor of the building were housed a beauty shop, a travel agency, a grocery store, and a lunch counter. Each of the upper floors contained a maid's lounge and a bathroom facility. Constructed during the decade in which apartment construction exceeded that of single-family houses, Alban Towers attempted to compensate for smaller family space by furnishing its tenants with luxurious amenities and public areas. The relative modesty of individual apartments is offset by the grandeur of the public spaces.\n\nAlban Towers was the Washington, D.C. headquarters of supporters of the presidential campaigns of John F. Kennedy, Eugene McCarthy, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Its hotel suites were frequented by such celebrities as Bette Davis and Frank Sinatra. During World War II it was discovered that Japanese spies had used the Alban Towers residence of the Japanese Naval attaché as a lookout point to the city as well as a place to tap into official radio frequencies.\n\nIts apartments were leased by the embassies of Great Britain, Canada, Australia, South Africa and others to house their diplomats. However, during the 1950s, this created controversy when the embassies of the newly independent African states attempted to lease some of its apartments; Washington was still a racially segregated city and the African diplomats were refused residence in Alban Towers and other area apartment buildings.\n\nOriginally, the building featured 132 units, mostly of lavish one-bedroom apartment homes, as well as a number of hotel suites. In 1930, responding to the large demand for apartment in the building, the number of units was increased by 84 with the construction of an additional two wings on the south side of the building in 1930.\n\nIn the 1960s, neglect of the owners to afford proper care and maintenance to the building led to its decline in status. In 1973 it was sold to Georgetown University for use as housing for some 450 students. In the 1980s and 1990s the building fell into a state of serious disrepair. The partnership of Edmonson & Gallagher contracted to purchase the building in 1986, but an association of tenants attempted to exercise a statutory right of first refusal, resulting in clouded title that was not resolved for several years. Sally Berk, president of the DC Preservation League, nominated the building as an historic landmark in 1990, and it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.\n\nIn 1995, after the sale to Edmonson had fallen through, Georgetown contracted to sell the building to a partnership led by Starwood. At the time of this sale, only 30 apartments in the building were occupied. Starwood paid several tenants to leave their apartments, and paid others to move to temporary housing while renovation work was to be conducted. The building was closed and renovation work began in the summer of 1997, but was stopped shortly thereafter for undisclosed reasons and ultimately abandoned. Finally, in 1999, the building was purchased by Charles E. Smith Co. Residential Realty, which undertook a costly restoration effort. Particular attention was paid to the preservation of the building's original architectural elements. The restoration included restoration architects and artisans to ensure that the original character of the building was retained. The exterior, lobby and hallways were restored, while the actual apartments — which had been demolished by previous owners — were completely rebuilt to serve modern demands. The total cost of the restoration was $63 million. The building was reopened in 2001.\n\nToday, the building provides residence to many diplomats and government officials, as well as to a lesser number of American University students, known to some as The AParty.\n\nAlban Towers' exterior comprises Limestone Tracery, bas-relief panels and brick, and has much Gothic-inspired ornamentation, including arched balcony openings, gargoyles, and rising spirals on the roof. The main entrance on Massachusetts Avenue features a crenelated porte-cochere with carved spandrels and corbel stones supporting its gothic arches. Also featured on the porte-cochere are six carved heads; five of medieval males and the sixth of an aviator inspired by Charles A. Lindbergh's historic flight.\n\nThe grand lobby is spacious and designed using Tudor ideals, featuring Tudor strapwork and plaster ceilings.\n\nThe hallways (which are protected under historic preservation laws) are designed with a rough plaster finish, pointed arches, and sculptural plaster pilasters and brackets. Sculptured plaster arches and panels and friezes in the public corridors resemble the signs of the zodiac.\n\nToday, the building offers 229 units in the form of studio and one, two and three bedroom luxury apartments between 486 and as rental properties.\n\nThere are two indoor garages for the building's residents; attached and detached. The attached garage is incorporated into the building's basement level and accommodates a limited number of cars. The detached garage is located opposite the building on the building's access drive, and features two underground heated levels of parking spaces. Additionally, the detached garage serves as access to the private garages of a number of luxury townhouses — Alban Row — located above the garage on 38th Street.\n\nThe building includes a grand lobby, a party room, fitness center, swimming pool, conference center, business center and rooftop garden.\n\nAn access drive runs behind the building from Cathedral Avenue to Garfield Street. Originally, a large park was located behind the building, but under the current ownership, it was scaled down into a nationally recognized butterfly garden, which was designed in coordination with the Washington Area Butterfly Club. The purpose of the scaling down of the park was to provide land for the Alban Row townhouses, which were built to offset the costs of the expensive restoration of 1999–2001.\n\n\n"}

In a 2008 interview with \"Von Pip Musical Express\", King recalled how he joined Lush: \"Miki called me up at work. I was a picture researcher at the \"NME\" at the time. I remember having read in the paper the story that Steve was leaving. We arranged to meet up in the not-that-famous-at-the-time pre-Britpop \"The Good Mixer\" in Camden Town. I lived just round the corner... We of course all got very drunk ...and I was in the band\". He adds, \"It was a bit of an eyebrow raiser – but also a bit of a relief really – that they didn't even want me to do an audition. In retrospect it made sense, as the most important thing when you're stuck together with someone 16 hours a day is that you get on pretty well\".\n\nLush was added to the Lollapalooza roster in 1992 by its organizer, Perry Farrell, the Jane's Addiction/Porno for Pyros frontman, who personally requested them for his new tour program.

Vaterstetten is on the outskirts of Munich, roughly twenty minutes by S-Bahn from Marienplatz.\n\nVaterstetten borders in the north on the community of Poing, in the northeast on the community of Anzing, in the east on the unincorporated area of the Ebersberg Forest (\"Ebersberger Forst\"), in the southeast on the community of Zorneding (all in Ebersberg district), in the southwest on the community of Grasbrunn, and in the west on the communities of Haar and Feldkirchen (all three in Munich district).\n\nThe community consists of the constituent centres of Baldham, Hergolding, Neufarn, Parsdorf, Purfing, Vaterstetten and Weißenfeld.\n\nBecause of being on the border of the sandur of Munich, an early settlement in the southern part of today's community area is unlikely, because the tillage was disadvantaged here compared to the northern part. Consequently, the oldest town of the community is Purfing, where a settlement from the period between 750 and 600 BC was found.\n\nVaterstetten was founded by the Old Bavarii Fater family.\nUntil 1056 the district of Weißenfeld (Wizzinvelt) was in the possession of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry III as a \"Reichsgut\". The fact he instructed his wife about negotiations over his ownership on these lands on his deathbed in the year 1056, shows how significant they must have been for him. \n\nIt was here in the summer of 1800 that the Parsdorf Ceasefire was signed by Major General Franz Joseph of Dietrichstein and General Jean Victor Moreau, which later came to an end with the Battle of Hohenlinden. In 1818, when there was the Royal Bavarian territorial reform, the community of Parsdorf was founded and it replaced the former \"Steuerdistricten\". The administrative seat of the community was transferred to Parsdorf probably because of its important coaching inn.\nAn increase of the population of the community began with the connection to the rail network in 1871.\n\nIn 1913 physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach settled in Vaterstetten, where he died 1916.\n\nThe district of Baldham was selected as a location for the studio of Hitler's sculptor Josef Thorak before the beginning of World War II. The building, which was created by Albert Speer, is now a branch of the Bavarian State Archaeological Collection in Munich. On 5 May 1945, the delegations of the German Army Group G and the 7th U.S. Army met here to discuss the surrender of the 200,000 German soldiers in southern Germany, which was finally signed in the neighbour community of Haar.\n\nOn 19 May 1944, a US Consolidated B-24 bomber crashed into the forest between Vaterstetten and the neighbouring town of Ottendichl (part of Haar). In 2009, the place has been marked by a memorial plaque.\n\nThe current community of Vaterstetten came into being with the municipal reform of 1978. The old community included all the same current centres as are now found in Vaterstetten, but it was named Parsdorf. On 1 May 1978, the community’s name was changed to Vaterstetten, by which time the community’s main centre had long been of that same name, along with Baldham.\nBefore that reform, a part of Baldham (named Baldham-Kolonie) belonged to Zorneding.\n\nVaterstetten is part of the Munich Transport and Tariff Association (\"Münchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund\", or MVV). The Munich S-Bahn’s lines S4 and S6 run over the Munich–Rosenheim line through the community serving the Vaterstetten and Baldham stations.\n\nTwo buslines of the \"Vaterstettener Innerörtlicher Personennahverkehr\" (Vaterstetten Local Passenger Transport, or VIP) run regularly in the local area.\n\nThe name Vaterstetten is well known to many motorists for its Autobahn roadhouse lying on the A99. The Autobahn itself runs by the community about one kilometre away. Through the community’s south end runs the \"Wasserburger Landstraße\" (officially named B304), one of Munich’s main arterial roads.\n\nWithin the community stand four elementary schools, a Hauptschule, a Realschule and the Humboldt-Gymnasium Vaterstetten, as well as a folk high school and a music school.\n\n\n\n"}

Fellow prominent members include the former party chairman and candidate for the 2013 general election Pierluigi Bersani and the former House Majority Leader Roberto Speranza. 16 senators also joined the group.\n\nOn 4 September 2017, he was chosen as the candidate of the left for the presidency of the Sicilian Region in 2017, supported by SI, MDP, as well as Possible, the Communist Refoundation Party, Civil Action, Italian Communist Party, and other minor left-wing parties. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, supports Fabrizio Micari, along with Popular Alternative and other centrist parties. A recent poll by Euromedia gives Fava 9.5% and Micari a mere 14%, while the conservative candidate and the candidate of the Five Star Movement poll ahead at around 35%.\n\n\n"}

If the player is still a rookie, R2-D2 can be picked up, and dropped anytime for hints. After being found, Yoda gives Luke an assignment and an objective that Luke will be required to complete. Each game world is composed of 100 screens, but the number of active screens can be set in the options menu. To progress in the game, the player must make errands, such as finding a key or an object, until they reach the final puzzle.\n\nThe Game Boy Color version was released in 1999. Like the computer version, the gameplay is a number of simple quests, and the game contains fifteen levels. The graphics are not as detailed or colorful compared to the computer game due to the limitations of the Game Boy Color hardware, and controlling the main character is more difficult and less fluid in this version due to the lack of a mouse. With a score of 2.0/10, \"Yoda Stories\" holds IGN's lowest-ever review rating for a Game Boy Color game, alongside Tarantula Studios' \"Evel Knievel\" (1999). \"Computer Gaming World\" gave the Windows version of the game a 1-star score.\n\n"}

In 1588, Gothus travelled to Germany and studied in the Rostock University for three years. He was influenced by Pierre de la Ramée (1515-1572) and his philosophy.\n\nAfter receiving a Master's degree, he returned to Uppsala in time for the Uppsala Synod in 1593 where the founding dogmas of the Church of Sweden were made final. He was appointed professor of logic at the recently reopened, and now Lutheran focused, Uppsala University. In 1598 he re-transferred himself to the professorship in astronomy.\nHe was, along with some other professors, suspended from his duty, because of demands that professors to sign a petition supporting Sigismund III Vasa as king of Sweden. However in 1604, his Protestant uncle Duke Charles was crowned as King Charles IX of Sweden. When a comet appeared on the sky in 1607, Laurentius declared he could interpret what this signified. The belief in astrology and the significance of heavenly signs were still strong. His interpretations made an impression on King Charles and he was re-instated him at the university.\n\nLaurentius had acquired a belief in Ramism from the writings French educational reformer Petrus Ramus and defended his views rigorously. Later he was also involved in philosophical disputes with Jonas Magni Wexionensis (1583-1651) who was a professor and head of Uppsala University and who was an adherent of Aristotle. \n\nGothus served as Bishop of the Diocese of Skara (1608–1609) and Bishop of the Diocese of Strängnäs (1609–1637). In 1628, he was tasked with the investigation of the visionary Margareta i Kumla. Her visions and alleged meetings with demons and angels were described by Bishop Gothus in a meeting of the Swedish clergy in 1629. During the reign of Christina, Queen of Sweden, Gothus served as Archbishop of Uppsala and Primate of Sweden from 1637–1646.\n\nLaurentius wrote many theological and astronomical works and also published calendars. He furthermore published a thorough \"Ethica Christiana\" 1615–30, a work in six parts in Swedish about Lutheranism. Following this, he in 1631 wrote a summary of this work which has been called the prime catechetical work from 17th century Sweden. He also wrote some historical works about Swedish history.\n"}

It began as the State Belt Railroad in 1889, and was renamed when the city bought the Port of San Francisco in 1969. As a state owned enterprise, the railroad asserted several unsuccessful claims to immunity from federal regulation. The railroad ceased operation in 1993.\n\nThe railroad connected the Port of San Francisco to many waterfront docks and to industries and warehouses which were adjacent to the waterfront. In its early years, it operated dual-gauged track to accommodate the North Pacific Coast and South Pacific Coast Railroads. It would eventually have 67 miles (108 km) of trackage and general offices in the Ferry Building. Its function was to switch railroad cars from four major railroads to points along its system and vice versa. At the southern portion of the line, a track along King Street (passing the location now occupied by Oracle Park) connected with the Southern Pacific. San Francisco Municipal Railway's \"E\" Embarcadero line now traverses this route. A train ferry slip at Pier 43 allowed interchange with the Northwestern Pacific, the Western Pacific, and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroads. To reach its northern terminus in the Presidio, the line passed through Fisherman's Wharf, Aquatic Park, and Fort Mason Tunnel. \n\nThe San Francisco Bay Railroad is the successor to the Belt Railroad and received approval to operate the remaining five miles of track in 2000.\n\nThe former roundhouse has been converted to commercial business but exists in a recognizable form on the Sansome St, Lombard St, The Embarcadero, and Chestnut St block.\n\nDuring its years of operation the railroad had 12 steam locomotives and 6 ALCO diesel engines: \nOver the years, the belt railroad's tracks hosted several noteworthy locomotives and trains. In 1949, the \"California Zephyr\" was positioned near the Ferry Building for its inaugural ceremony. In 1971, the \"Flying Scotsman\" concluded its American tour by shuttling back and forth on a stretch of track adjacent to the Embarcadero and near Fisherman's Wharf. Owner Alan Peglar ran out of funds and the locomotive spent most of 1972 stored at an army base in Stockton, California. In 1975, the \"American Freedom Train\" pulled by ex-Southern Pacific Daylight locomotive #4449 visited San Francisco. For public viewing, the train's cars were switched to the Presidio by the belt line. The locomotive itself remained on display at Aquatic Park near the foot of Hyde Street. In 1987, the tracks along the Embarcadero just south of Sansome Street hosted a rail fair. Diesel locomotives and steam locomotives including V&T's \"J.W. Bowker\" (2-4-0 locomotive) were on display.\n\nCurrently Locomotive #4 is being restored by the San Francisco Trains group, with larger plans to change the old Bayshore Roundhouse, originally owned by Southern Pacific, to a historic community destination. Due to work on the Roundhouse, it has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n"}

He belonged to the Arrernte indigenous people of Central Australia. His works were painted in acrylic or watercolours and influenced by themes from Dreamtime myths. His paintings are to be found in Australia's Parliament House, Canberra and many other public and private collections.\n\nW. Rubuntja died from advanced kidney failure in Alice Springs Hospital on 3 July 2005. His family asked that, in accordance with Aboriginal Australian practices concerning respect for the dead, he should be referred to only as W. Rubuntja (or W. or Rubuntja, depending on context) for the time being, and that any pictures of him be withdrawn from display until 12 months after his death.\n\nFor Wenten, both the \"Aranda Watercolour\" style of art developed by Albert Namatjira (which has come to be known as the Hermannsburg School), and the \"dot paintings\" popularised by the artists of Papunya (Papunya Tula) reflected traditional values and themes, despite differences in technique:\n\n\"Doesn't matter what sort of painting we do in this country, it still belongs to the people, all the people. This is worship, work, culture. It's all Dreaming. There are two ways of painting. Both ways are important, because that's culture.\" – (\"The Weekend Australian Magazine\", April, 2002)\n\nWenten was a man of great generosity in both his personal and political life. He \"brought up\" generations of young non-indigenous workers engaged by the various central Australian organisations, teaching them about matters such as appropriate etiquette, traditional law, and the economics and politics of daily Aboriginal life. It was commonplace, too, for him to return from a distant meeting to spend many hours solving the problems of a local community member, finding money for food, tracking down a missing relative or fixing a dispute that to anyone else seemed intractable. He did such things daily, while providing the primary support, financial and otherwise, for a personal household that often numbered thirty or forty people.\n\nWenten developed a highly refined view of reconciliation. The belief that the Aboriginal and the non-Aboriginal communities have 'to interpret each other' recurs throughout his life’s work. His ability to integrate Indigenous and non-Indigenous concepts was truly remarkable. He recognised the importance of working out a process through which people could live harmoniously together, and saw this as only possible if each \"side\" gave equal recognition to the importance of the Law of the other:\n\n\"We can’t fall in the power to the other Law. They can’t change our Law, our side, and we can’t change their side, or we will break our Law again, and they’ll break their law…… The Dreaming is really all over Australia. We must teach the whitefellas.\"\n\nFor Wenten it was only through real respect for both one's own and the other’s Law and knowledge that reconciliation could be achieved. It was only when the complex interplay of practical and symbolic justice was understood that real progress would be made. Neither practical solutions nor rhetorical recognition were sufficient alone. He expressed such things (and many others) with great humour and wonderful use of metaphor.\n\nWenten was a key figure in the land rights movement, the protection of Aboriginal sacred sites in the Northern Territory and organised the formation of key Aboriginal organisations in Alice Springs over the past 30 years.\n\nHis autobiography: \"The Town Grew Up Dancing: The Life and Art of Wenten Rubuntja\" by himself and Jenny Green was published by IAD Press, Mparntwe (Alice Springs), in 2002.\n"}
{"id": "1799146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799146", "title": "Anúna", "text": "Anúna\n\nAnúna is a choral ensemble based in Ireland. Founded in 1987 by Irish composer Michael McGlynn under the name An Uaithne, taking the current name in 1991, and in 2010 becoming \"Anúna, Ireland's National Choir,\" the group has recorded 17 albums, and achieved a high level of international success, including a significant role in Riverdance from 1994 to 1996. Almost all of their repertoire is composed or arranged by McGlynn.\n\nThe original name of the group, An Uaithne, \"is the collective description for the three ancient forms of Irish music[...] the Goltraí (song of lament), Geantraí (song of joy) and Suantraí (the lullaby)\". McGlynn reconstructed and arranged a substantial amount of early and medieval Irish music, as well as writing original pieces. Anúna do not work with a conductor in performance, and move throughout the venue at different points in concert. Their standard line-up is 12 to 14 singers from a pool of 25 to 30.\n\nMcGlynn has stated: \"My interest in traditional song stemmed from my schooldays in Coláiste na Rinne (Ring College) in Dungarvan, and I also felt a need to explore and communicate my enthusiasm for medieval music, most particularly Irish medieval music, to the general public. The eclectic repertoire that characterises the music of Anúna was born in this way\". McGlynn re-set and rearranged historical texts and reconstructions of medieval Irish music. These included the 12th century pieces \"Dicant Nunc\" and \"Cormacus Scripsit\", both of which come from Irish manuscripts and featured in the repertoire of An Uaithne. Other reconstructions including \"Miserere Miseris\" from the \"Dublin Troper\" and \"Quem Queritis\" from \"The Dublin Play\" continue to feature in the repertoire of Anúna. McGlynn has said: \"I think that one of the purposes of Anúna has been to open the door of obscurity to some of the many medieval pieces that we've recorded\".\n\nAn Uaithne featured a number of traditional music arrangements done by McGlynn as part of their repertoire. He has stated: \"One of the misapprehensions about my music is that I am not actually concerned with saving Irish traditional music; I am not a traditionalist. The only exposure I had [to traditional Irish song] was during my year at Coláiste na Rinne in Dún Garbhán. The songs that I set are not from a specific collection; they are more impressions of the songs I remembered.\" McGlynn also created new compositions that could be perceived as arrangements of Irish songs but were, in fact, new melodies composed to traditional texts. These works are not arrangements and they became a feature of An Uaithne's repertoire and continue to be part of the Anúna canon. McGlynn has stated: \"People just assume that I have just found a “living” version. In fact I have done what has made solo traditional music so viable: I have created a new version. I take the songs and reinterpret them in a new way. My priority is always to create a choral version that works.\" \n\nAccording to Stephen Eddins at AllMusic, \"[...] with the intent that it would unite the discipline of classical choral singing with the unaffected spontaneity typical of Irish folk singing.\" McGlynn supports this in his blog:\nI can now hear two types of singer on the recording. There are large, plummy voices favoured by the classically trained singers I had gathered around me for An Uaithne, but now I can hear the “others” – early music singers, traditional singers and untrained singers. There is a fight going on. The performances are rough, but hugely energetic. Many of the more classical singers or choral groupies are stuck to the inadequately learned sheet music, while the new people are singing without music and without affectation.\n\nThe genesis of the choir's vocal sound derives from a number of different sources including \"Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares\", although he has stated that Anúna are not an expression of their culture in the same way as the Bulgarian choir because, when creating Anúna, there was no point in his pretending that there had been a culture of part-singing in Ireland. McGlynn has stated: \"What I have done is to try to always create an accessibility using the concept of fragility in the voice to allow the audience to access music that otherwise they might find overtly and harmonically complex or technically demanding to listen to.\" \n\nOnce a group of classically-trained singers, Anúna in the early 1990s began to include untrained singers with experience in non-classical music genres thus achieving the more natural timbre that McGlynn was seeking. \"This is the 'Anúna' sound – powerful and fragile, immediate and human. When I developed it, it was almost as a protest against the artificial nature of choral groups I had been part of, where singers appeared to sing for themselves, never as a genuine unit and never for the audience.\" \n\nThe vocal timbre of the group has changed over the last thirty years according to McGlynn, \"In 1994 Anúna was embryonic and restrained by the capacity of the singers to actually perform the material. I wrote for the instrument I had available to me, and the material both suffers and benefits from this restriction. Today I don’t have those same restrictions, with members drawn from all over the world. Anúna now contains some of the finest choral singers on the planet, so I am gradually becoming used to the idea that I can stretch my voice as a writer considerably more than in the past.\"\n\nMcGlynn formed the choir \"An Uaithne\" in 1987, after involvement with college choirs at both University College Dublin and Trinity College Dublin, and the semi-professional RTE Chamber Choir. Founder members included Monica Donlon, and opera singer Miriam Blennerhassett from Howth, both of whom he had met at UCD, and Garrath Patterson. The choir's earliest concerts featured medieval Irish and European music, contemporary choral pieces by Irish composers and Irish folk arrangements.\n\nIn 1991, \"An Uaithne\" officially became Anúna, a simplified phonetic rendition of the Irish \"an uaithne\" () proposed by Monica Donlon's mother, Paula Donlon. In 1993, they released their disc \"ANÚNA\", a sixteen-track CD followed, in 1994, by the album \"Invocation\". Both albums were licensed by the Irish label Celtic Heartbeat and released in 1995 The album \"Anúna\" achieved a \"Billboard\" World Music chart placing at number 11 in 1995.\n\nAnúna was associated with \"Riverdance\" from 1994 until 1996. They gave the first performance of the piece at the Eurovision Song Contest, spending 18 weeks at number 1 in the Irish singles chart and reaching number 9 in the UK singles chart. They featured on the CD \"\" and on the DVD \"Riverdance: the Show\". They sang the opening choral section entitled \"Cloudsong\" with a solo by soprano Katie McMahon. \n\nAnúna won an Irish National Entertainment Award for Classical music in 1994. In 1995, they released \"Omnis\", followed by \"Deep Dead Blue\" in 1996. The latter gained an international release on the Gimell/Polygram label in 1999 and was nominated for a Classical Brit Award in 2000. The group left \"Riverdance\" in 1996. Anúna soprano Eimear Quinn won the Eurovision Song Contest in the same year in Oslo.\n\nIn 1997 Anúna released the CD \"Behind the Closed Eye\", an orchestral collaboration with the Ulster Orchestra, Northern Ireland's leading symphony orchestra. The choir appeared at the World Sacred Music Festival in Morocco in 1998 (returning in 2002). In 1999 Anúna performed at the first ever Irish Prom at the BBC Proms in the Royal Albert Hall in London. \n\n2000 saw the release of \"Cynara\" followed by \"Winter Songs\" (US Release title \"Christmas Songs\") in 2002. The same year the group appeared at the \"Proms in the Park\" in Belfast, an open-air concert featuring The Ulster Orchestra in the grounds of Belfast's City Hall.\n\nTheir album \"Sensation\", released in April 2006, was an eclectic collection, with settings by McGlynn of texts by Cardinal Henry Newman, Arthur Rimbaud and Hildegard von Bingen. The title track featured a spoken recitation of the Rimbaud poem \"Sensation\" by the Breton singer Gilles Servat. In January 2007, Anúna recorded a series of live performances in Cleveland which have been broadcast extensively on PBS across the US in a \"special\" produced by The Elevation Group and Maryland Public Television. The group undertook a two-month tour of the US in Autumn 2007. The album \"Anúna: Celtic Origins\" was released in the same year. It was the number one selling album in the World Music category of Nielsen Soundscan in August of that year. November 2008 saw the release in the US of \"Christmas Memories\", a CD and DVD release coupled with PBS Broadcasts nationally in November and December. The album entered the Billboard World Music Charts at number 6 on first week of release and spent 10 weeks in the Billboard World Music top 20 albums. The single \"Ding Dong Merrily on High\" reached number 26 on the Billboard \"Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks\" chart in December 2008.\n\nIn June 2009, Anúna released the CD \"Sanctus\" and DVD \"Invocations of Ireland\". \"Sanctus\" featured four previously released tracks that have been remastered and in the case of one track, \"Nobilis Humilis\", have had parts re-recorded and added to the original song. Also featured are McGlynn's \"Agnus Dei\", \"Miserere mei, Deus\" by Gregorio Allegri and Crucifixus by Antonio Lotti. \"Invocations of Ireland\" was a 56-minute DVD filmed throughout Ireland by Michael McGlynn, and featured the music of Anúna sung in the Irish landscape. The DVD was released on Columbia in Japan and was broadcast extensively on the Ovation Channel in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn July 2009, Anúna gave the first performance of \"Behind the Closed Eye\" in the Republic of Ireland at Dublin's National Concert Hall with the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland.\n\nIn 2010 Anúna adopt the name \"Anúna, Ireland's National Choir\" as their official title and inaugurate an Education and Outreach programme. The group performed again with the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland in July 2010, with Finnish violinist Linda Lampenius. The programme included a number of new pieces and arrangements including the nine-minute McGlynn fantasia based on the songs of Thomas Moore, \"The Last Rose\".\n\nIn June 2010, Anúna collaborated on a new CD and DVD project with The Wiggles, entitled \"It's Always Christmas With You!\" and released in 2011. In September 2010, Anúna recorded an arrangement by Michael McGlynn of \"Away in a Manger\" with ex-Celtic Woman soloist Órla Fallon for her Christmas PBS special, which also featured David Archuleta and another ex-Anúna and Celtic Woman soloist Méav Ní Mhaolchatha. The special was filmed in Dublin, Ireland. No fewer than five of the soloists who have been featured on Celtic Woman since 2005 (Órla Fallon, Méav Ní Mhaolchatha, Lynn Hilary, Éabha McMahon, Tara McNeill and Deirdre Shannon) have been members of Anúna.\n\nOn 27–29 January 2011, Anúna joined Irish musical pioneers Clannad for three concerts at Dublin's Christ Church Cathedral for the Donegal group's fortieth anniversary celebrations. They collaborated on five tracks, \"Dúlamán\", \"Caislean Óir\", \"Theme from Harry's Game\", \"In a Lifetime\" and \"I Will Find You\". Anúna also performed a version of \"Media Vita\" as they came onstage, integrating musical elements of \"Caislean Óir\".\n\nAnúna made their Chinese debut in June 2011 touring a number of cities. In Beijing they performed at the Beijing Poly Theater and in Shanghai at the Shanghai Oriental Art Center. In July 2011 the National Concert Hall in Dublin presented the first Anúna International Summer School. The event took place between 5 and 9 July, and featured a team of international facilitators including Matthew Oltman, then musical director of Chanticleer. In September their album \"Christmas Memories\" débuted at 95 in The Billboard 200. To finish the year, Anúna visited Japan, a trip which included concerts and workshops. This tour also included a high-profile visit to the area affected by the tsunami of 2011 and Fukushima. In April 2012, Anúna participated in the premiere of Philip Hammond's \"Requiem for the Lost Souls of the Titanic\" at St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast.\n\nTo celebrate their 25th anniversary in June 2012 Anúna released their new album \"Illumination\", a fifteen track CD and, in May, featured on the soundtrack to the video game \"Diablo III\". Blizzard Entertainment's audio director, Russell Brower says \"Working somewhat against conventional expectations, Hell is a beautiful and seductive sound, provided by Dublin’s uniquely astounding choral group ANÚNA\". As of February 2014, the game has sold 15 million copies across all platforms. In October, the choir gave a workshop at the Shanghai Conservatory and, in November, they hosted a series of public choral workshop events across the Netherlands. 2013 marked the first concert performances and workshops in Canada for the group. In 2015 Anúna sold-out Beijing's National Centre for the Performing Arts. \n\nIn 2017, as part of their 30th Anniversary year, Anúna performed as part of a collaborative project entitled \"Takahime\", in front of a sold-out audience on February 16th at Tokyo's Orchard Hall. It included a performance of Yokomichi Mario's adaptation of W.B. Yeats \"At the Hawk's Well\" entitled \"Takahime\", directed and scored by McGlynn and Gensho Umewaka (a Japanese \"National Treasure\"), who said of the collaboration with Anúna, “I think Celtic choral music and Noh are similar in both being abstract arts...So we have no need to hesitate and can just make all the creative sparks we wish.\" The performance featured a full cast of Noh actors and musicians, with Umewaka in the role of The Hawk.\n\nOn July 30 2017 the choir performed at the Francis Ledwidge memorial event at Richmond Barracks in Dublin, with McGlynn commenting \"When I discovered Ledwidge for the first time through the academic work of Inchicore poet Liam O'Meara, it was like finding a kindred spirit\" and \"Over the last two decades I have taken his poetry around the world as Anúna has toured. Each new setting I make of his texts yields more and more layers of meaning, more subtlety and nuance. ... Ledwidge remains one of my greatest poetic inspirations.\"\n\nIn November 2017 Anúna released a video, created by Michael McGlynn, of the piece \"Shadow of the Lowlands\" composed by Yasunori Mitsuda. Speaking of his first encounter with Anúna through their album \"Deep Dead Blue\", Mitsuda says \"I felt that ANÚNA was a new type of chorus that I’d never heard before. My attention was drawn to the lead singer, Michael McGlynn, and I dreamt about making music with ANÚNA one day. After 20 years, my dream came true through the making of the game Xenoblade Chronicles 2\". \"Shadow of the Lowlands\" is one of four that features on the soundtrack of the Nintendo Switch video game Xenoblade Chronicles 2. In February 2018 the group won the Outstanding Ensemble category of the Annual Game Music Awards 2017 for their contributions to the game. In April Anúna joined Mitsuda on stage in April for a series of full concert performances of music from Xenogears to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of the video game. \n\nThe ensemble works on a \"project basis\" and draws from a pool of available singers, with at least some training in the \"Anuna technique\" and numbering up to around 30. For any particular project (tour, performance or corporate event) 12-14 singers are \"called up.\" Singers can come from various backgrounds but must have or acquire some classical singing technique and ability to read sheet music. They come from many countries, but the only rehearsals not connected with particular performances and tours occur in central Dublin, on a semi-regular basis. The ensemble emphasises that it is not full-time, does not expect exclusive commitment, and that performers will have a services contract for a particular project or tour. Performance and musical reproduction rights are vested in an Irish company, Anuna Teoranta, while composition rights are managed by the composer-in-residence.\n\nMiriam Blennerhassett is an Irish mezzo-soprano, and is the current Chorus Master of Anúna, also featuring as a soloist on CD, DVD and in performance. She features as a soloist on the albums \"Omnis\", \"Invocation\", \"Sensation\", \"Deep Dead Blue\", \"Celtic Origins\" and \"Behind the Closed Eye\". She appears as a soloist on the DVDs \"Invocations of Ireland\" and \"Celtic Origins\". Blennerhassett is a founder member of Anúna.\n\nLucy Champion is an English singer. She currently holds the position Education Co-ordinator with Anúna and is a featured soprano soloist with the choir. She appears as a soloist on the albums \"Christmas Songs\", \"Invocation\", \"Sensation\", \"Anúna\", \"Sanctus\", \"Cynara\", \"Deep Dead Blue\", \"Christmas Memories\", \"Celtic Origins\" and \"Behind the Closed Eye\". She appears as a soloist on the DVDs \"Invocations of Ireland\" and \"Celtic Origins\". She was Concerts and Events Manager for The Ulster Orchestra in Belfast, Administrator and Education Manager for the Wren Orchestra in London, Education Manager with the National Concert Hall in Dublin and is currently a choral clinician and educator, most recently giving a series of workshops at Dublin's National Concert Hall in 2009/2010.\n\nJohn McGlynn is a tenor with Anúna and an Irish singer-songwriter. He is also Michael McGlynn's identical twin brother. His distinctive guitar style features on many of Anúna's albums. Originally an architect by trade, he currently acts as a director of the choir, touring in that capacity throughout Europe and the US. He released his solo album \"Songs For A Fallen Angel\" in 2000 and has formed a trio entitled Sweet June. His arrangements and original songs appear on a number of Anúna releases. \"If All She Has Is You\" appears on the \"Celtic Origins\" album and concert DVD and has been covered by Celtic Woman soloist Lynn Hilary on her debut solo album. Other arrangements and original pieces include \"The Fisher King\", \"Buachaill ón Éirne\", \"Siúil a Rúin\" and \"O Come All Ye Faithful\". He features as a soloist on the albums \"Christmas Songs\", \"Invocation\", \"Anúna\", \"Deep Dead Blue\", \"Christmas Memories\", \"Celtic Origins\" and \"Cynara\". He appears as a soloist on the DVDs \"Invocations of Ireland\", \"Celtic Origins\" and \"Christmas Memories\".\n\nA number of singers who have left the choir have gone on to achieve international recognition in their own right:\n\nSome of the singers who have featured as soloists in Celtic Woman are ex-members of the group:\n\nThe group has released many albums and several DVDs since 1991:\n+ Both albums amalgamated into a single, remastered release in 2003<br>\n Indicates a compilati.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1799157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799157", "title": "Complex fluid", "text": "Complex fluid\n\nComplex fluids are mixtures that have a coexistence between two phases: solid–liquid (suspensions or solutions of macromolecules such as polymers), solid–gas (granular), liquid–gas (foams) or liquid–liquid (emulsions). They exhibit unusual mechanical responses to applied stress or strain due to the geometrical constraints that the phase coexistence imposes. The mechanical response includes transitions between solid-like and fluid-like behavior as well as fluctuations. Their mechanical properties can be attributed to characteristics such as high disorder, caging, and clustering on multiple length scales.\n\nShaving cream is an example of a complex fluid. Without stress, the foam appears to be a solid: it does not flow and can support (very) light loads. However, when adequate stress is applied, shaving cream flows easily like a fluid. On the level of individual bubbles, the flow is due to rearrangements of small collections of bubbles. On this scale, the flow is not smooth, but instead consists of fluctuations due to rearrangements of the bubbles and releases of stress. These fluctuations are similar to the fluctuations that are studied in earthquakes.\n\nThe dynamics of the particles in complex fluids are an area of current research. Energy lost due to friction may be a nonlinear function of the velocity and normal forces. The topological inhibition to flow by the crowding of constituent particles is a key element in these systems. Under certain conditions, including high densities and low temperatures, when externally driven to induce flow, complex fluids are characterized by irregular intervals of solid-like behavior followed by stress relaxations due to particle rearrangements. The dynamics of these systems are highly nonlinear in nature. The increase in stress by an infinitesimal amount or a small displacement of a single particle can result in the difference between an arrested state and fluid-like behavior. \n\nAlthough many materials found in nature can fit into the class of complex fluids, very little is well understood about them. Inconsistent and controversial conclusions concerning their material properties still persist. The careful study of these systems may lead to \"new physics\" and new states of matter. For example, it has been suggested that these systems can jam and a \"jamming phase diagram\" can be used to consider how these systems can jam and unjam. It is not known whether further research will demonstrate these findings, or whether such a theoretical framework will prove useful. As yet this large body of theoretical work has been poorly supported with experiments.\n\n"}
{"id": "1799173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799173", "title": "North Island Main Trunk", "text": "North Island Main Trunk\n\nThe North Island Main Trunk (NIMT) is the main railway line in the North Island of New Zealand, connecting the capital city Wellington with the country's largest city, Auckland. The line is long and passes through Paraparaumu, Palmerston North, Taihape, National Park, Taumarunui, Te Kuiti, Hamilton, and Pukekohe.\n\nMost of the NIMT is single track with frequent passing loops, built to the New Zealand rail gauge of . The line is double track between Wellington and Waikanae (except for a single-track section through the tunnels, between North Junction, which is from Wellington and South Junction, which is from Wellington, on the Pukerua Bay to Paekakariki section), between Hamilton and Te Kauwhata (except for the single-track Waikato River Bridge at Ngāruawāhia), and between Meremere and Auckland Britomart. Around (approximately 65%) of the line is electrified in three separate sections: one section at 1600 V DC between Wellington and Waikanae, and two sections at 25 kV AC: between Palmerston North and Te Rapa (Hamilton) and between Papakura and Auckland Britomart.\n\nThe first section of what became the NIMT opened in 1873 in Auckland. Construction at the Wellington end began in 1885. The line was completed in 1908 and was fully operational by 1909. It is credited for having been an economic lifeline for the young nation, and for having opened up the centre of the North Island to European settlement and investment. In the early days, a passenger journey between Wellington and Auckland could take more than 20 hours; today, the \"Northern Explorer\" takes approximately 11 hours.\n\nThe NIMT has been described as an \"engineering miracle\", with numerous engineering feats such as viaducts, tunnels and a spiral built to overcome large elevation differences with grades suitable for steam engines.\n\nAuckland's first railway was the line between Point Britomart and Onehunga via Penrose, opened in 1873.\n\nThe Wellington-Longburn (near Palmerston North) section was constructed between 1881 and 1886 by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR). The company was acquired by the New Zealand Railways Department in 1908.\n\nFrom Te Awamutu it was proposed that the line be built via Taupo or via Taumarunui, the eventual route. Four options were considered before the Minister of Public Works decided on the present route in 1884, but, when it was realised just how difficult that route was, further surveys considered two other options in 1888. Construction of the final central section began on 15 April 1885, when paramount chief Wahanui of Ngāti Maniapoto turned the first sod outside Te Awamutu. It was 23 years before the two lines met, as the central section was difficult to survey and construct. The crossing of the North Island Volcanic Plateau with deep ravines required nine viaducts and the world-famous Raurimu Spiral. By the beginning of 1908, there was a gap between Erua and Ohakune, with a connecting horse-drawn coach service. From Ohakune south to Waiouru the Public Works Department operated the train, as this section had not yet been handed over to the Railways Department.\n\nThe gap was closed on 7 August 1908 for the first through passenger train, the 11-car Parliamentary Special carrying the Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward and other parliamentarians north to see the American Great White Fleet at Auckland. But much of the new section was temporary, with some cuttings north of Taonui having vertical batters and some unballasted sections of track. Ward drove the last spike on 6 November 1908, and the 'Last Spike' monument is at Manganui-o-te-Ao , near Pokaka. A two-day NIMT service started on 9 November, with an overnight stop at Ohakune.\n\nOn 14 February 1909 the first NIMT express left Auckland for Wellington, an overnight trip scheduled to take 19 hours 15 minutes, with a sleeping car, day cars with reclining seats, and postal/parcels vans. The dining car went on the north express from Wellington to Ohakune, then transferred to the southbound express, so avoiding the heavy gradients of the central section.\n\nSeveral sections of the line have been upgraded and deviated:\n\nIn 1913 the maximum speed limit on the NIMT was raised to , reducing the journey time by 1 hour 25 minutes Auckland-Wellington or to 17 hours and between 30 and 45 minutes. Under T. Ronayne, the Railways Department general manager from 1895 to 1913, the section south to Parnell was duplicated and improvements made to the worst gradients and tight curves between Auckland and Mercer. Under his successor E. H. Hiley the second Parnell Tunnel with two tracks and an easier gradient was completed in 1915–1916. On the Kakariki bank between Halcombe and Marton a deviation reduced the 1 in 53 grade to 1 in 70. A 1914 Act authorised spending on the Westfield Deviation, new stations at Auckland and Wellington, track doubling (Penrose-Papakura, Ohinewai-Huntly, Horotiu-Frankton, Newmarket-New Lynn), and grade easements from Penrose to Te Kuiti, but the war delayed most of these works for over a decade.\n\nIn 1927 automatic colour-light signalling was installed from Otahuhu to Mercer. In 1930 the signalling was extended to Frankton and the from there to Horotiu was doubled. The north to Ngāruawāhia was doubled from 5 December 1937, followed by Ngāruawāhia to Huntly on 4 December 1938 and Huntly to Ohinewai and Papakura to Paerata in December 1939. By then, wartime shortages delayed further double-tracking. Pokeno to Mercer was doubled from 11 November 1951, Pukekohe to Pokeno 21 November 1954, Mercer to Amokura 1 July 1956 and Ohinewai to Te Kauwhata 14 December 1958. The between Amokura and Te Kauwhata remain single track, as does Ngāruawāhia bridge.\n\nIn 1930 the Westfield Deviation was opened, creating a new eastern route from Auckland to Westfield via Glen Innes and Hobsons Bay, running into the new Auckland railway station and providing better access to the Port of Auckland. The original section between Auckland and Westfield via Newmarket later ceased to be part of the NIMT: Auckland to Newmarket became the Auckland-Newmarket Line, and Newmarket to Westfield became part of the North Auckland Line (NAL) which runs between Whangarei and Westfield.\n\nIn the late 1930s, bridges replaced level crossings at Ohinewai, Taupiri and Hopuhopu.\n\nThe double track Tawa Flat deviation opened to goods trains on 22 July 1935 and to passenger trains on 19 June 1937, bypassing the original single track WMR line between Wellington and Tawa. With a pair of tunnels under the Wellington hills, the deviation alleviated issues with more and heavier freight traffic on the steep and twisting original route where long sections at 1 in 60 gradient required banker engines. The Wellington to Johnsonville section of the original line was retained as the Johnsonville Line and the Johnsonville to Tawa section closed.\n\nThe sections from Plimmerton to South Junction, north of Pukerua Bay and Muri, and North Junction to Paekakariki were duplicated in 1940. From 24 July 1940 electrification at 1500 V DC of the southern section of the NIMT from Wellington to Paekakariki was completed. The Tawa Flat deviation has a long tunnel (Tawa No 2) not suitable for steam operation because of excessive smoke (although steam trains were temporarily operated in the new deviation from 1935). A Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940, so that new signal boxes were not required and five stations between Tawa and Pukerua Bay no longer had to be continually staffed for Tablet operation; see Kapiti Line. Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\nThe difficult section down the Paekakariki Escarpment from Pukerua Bay to Paekakariki with five tunnels between South and North Junctions remains single track. Duplication from Tawa to Porirua opened on 15 December 1957, from Porirua to Paremata on 7 November 1960, and Paremata to Plimmerton on 16 October 1961. The section between Porirua and Plimmerton was straightened in conjunction with the duplication by reclaiming land along the eastern shore of Porirua Harbour.\n\nBetween 1964 and 1966 a deviation away from the centre of Palmerston North via the Milson deviation on the edge of the city.\n\nIn 1967 the floors of the tunnels on the WMR section between Paekakariki and Pukerua Bay were lowered to enable the DA class locomotives to travel all the way to Wellington.\n\nBetween 1973 and 1981 the major Mangaweka deviation in the central section between Mangaweka and Utiku was built, with three viaducts, all over 70m tall, crossing the Rangitikei and Kawhatau rivers.\n\nThe central section from Te Rapa near Hamilton to Palmerston North was electrified at 25 kV AC between 1984 and 1988 as part of the Think Big government energy programme. Some tunnels were opened out or bypassed by deviations while in others clearances were increased, and curves eased. The section between Ohakune and Horopito was realigned with three viaducts replaced to handle higher loads and speeds. The most notable bridge replaced was the curved metal viaduct at Hapuawhenua by a modern concrete structure, though the original has been restored as a tourist attraction.\n\nIn 2009–10, the 1.5 km section of line between Wellington Junction and Distant Junction was rebuilt from double track to triple track, to ease peak-time congestion.\n\nIn February 2011 duplication between Paekakariki and Waikanae was completed as part of the upgrade and expansion of the Wellington suburban network; see Kapiti Line for more information.\n\nIn 2012–13 four bridges near Rangiriri between Auckland and Hamilton were replaced. The bridges were all over 100 years old with steel spans and timber piers, and were replaced by modern low-maintenance concrete ballast deck bridges. Bridges 479, 480, 481 & 482 were replaced, with lengths of , , and respectively.\n\nThe construction of the Peka Peka to Otaki section of the Kapiti Expressway required 1.3 km of the NIMT immediately north of Otaki station to be realigned. Construction began in 2017, and trains were switched onto the new alignment over the 2019 Easter long weekend (19–22 April).\n\nIn the Auckland area, a third main line between Wiri and Westfield or Wiri and Papakura, to allow freight trains to bypass stationary passenger trains, has been proposed.\n\nThere are three independent sections of the NIMT which are electrified: Auckland's urban network and the central section (25 kV AC) from Palmerston North – Te Rapa (north of Hamilton) at (25 kV AC). Wellington's urban network is electrified at (1500 V DC); as formerly used in other sections of the New Zealand network. In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the Matangi EMU, to increase the power available. \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer Evan Parry in the first volume of the \"New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology\" in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following World War I, Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the Wellington–Paekakariki section via the Tawa Flat deviation that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3 km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by Transdev Wellington for Metlink suburban passenger services on the Kapiti Line, and was extended to Paraparaumu on 7 May 1983 and Waikanae on 20 February 2011. Funded by the Greater Wellington Regional Council, the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new FP class Matangi electric multiple units.\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from New Zealand Treasury and the Ministry of Works and two experts from Sweden (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive is a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nThe Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with English Electric to specify D class diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 D class locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, the General Motors G12 export models were ordered, becoming the D class.\n\nThe section between Palmerston North and Hamilton was electrified at 25 kV 50 Hz AC, opened on 24 June 1988 as one of the Muldoon National Government's \"Think Big\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese Railway Technical Research Institute. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at up the Raurimu Spiral, an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at , cutting 3–5 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new fibre optic communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to Clear Communications for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.\n\nProposals to electrify the Auckland suburban rail network dated back to the 1960s, they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety. In 2005 the central government decided to implement a proposal to electrify the urban network at 25 kV AC, the same system as on the central NIMT. This included of the NIMT itself, from Britomart to just south of Papakura. Work on electrification of the Auckland network began in 2010. The first revenue electric services using AM class EMUs commenced on 28 April 2014 between Britomart and Onehunga on the Onehunga Line. The electrification project on the Auckland network, including the Auckland-Papakura section of the NIMT, was completed in July 2015, with all suburban services being electric. A diesel shuttle service runs on the non-electrified Pukekohe-Papakura section.\n\nThe completion of Auckland's electrification leaves a gap of to the central NIMT electrification at Te Rapa, north of Hamilton. Electrification may be extended south as the Auckland suburban system expands, but this will depend on further government funding. In February 2008 former Auckland Regional Council Chairman Mike Lee suggested the initial electrification might be extended to Pukekohe, leaving a gap to Te Rapa. In 2012, in response to public submissions, the board of Auckland Transport decided to include an investigation into electrifying to Pukekohe to its 10-year programme. ATAP, Auckland's 2018–2028 plan provides for Pukekohe electrification, a third line from Westfield to Wiri and further new electric trains. In 2020 the government announced funding for electrification from Papakura to Pukekohe.\n\nA paper written in 2008 for then railway infrastructure owner ONTRACK investigated the possibility of electrifying the remaining Papakura-Te Rapa gap between the Auckland urban system's terminus at Papakura on the NIMT and the central NIMT system, along with electrification of the East Coast Main Trunk to Tauranga. The report put the total cost of electrification at $860 million, with $433 million for the Papakura-Te Rapa section. It concluded that money would be better spent on grade and curvature easements, removing speed restrictions and increasing the length of passing loops.\n\nIn Wellington, there is an gap from Waikanae to the central NIMT electrification at Palmerston North. Since the extension of electrification to Waikanae in February 2012, there have been calls for the electrification to be extended by to Otaki. If this happens, there will be a gap. As the two electrification systems are different, multi-current locomotives or multiple units would be required for through electric working, should that gap be ever closed, unless one electric system is converted to be consistent with the other.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, KiwiRail announced their plan to withdraw from service, over a two-year period, the EF class electric locomotives (the only electric rolling stock working the central electrified section) without replacing them. The reasons given for the decision included the fact that the EFs are now close to their end of life (approximately 30 years old) and suffer from frequent breakdowns (on average every which is well below the expected breakdown-free service interval of ) and that having to change from a diesel locomotive to an electric one and back again at each end of the electrified section is labour-intensive, time-consuming and adds to costs. KiwiRail did not intend to de-electrify the section but would maintain it so that electric rolling stock could be reintroduced in the future.\n\nOn 30 October 2018, the Government announced that it is retaining the EF class electric locomotives, to help meet its long term emissions goals and boost the economy. The 15 remaining EF class locomotives will be refurbished by KiwiRail and will continue to run between Hamilton and Palmerston North.\n\nOn 6 August 2008 at 9am, a train (which included 100-year-old carriage AA1013, restored by the Mainline Steam Trust) departed Wellington in a re-enactment of 7 August 1908 Parliamentary Special carrying the Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward to Auckland, stopping overnight at Taihape and Taumarunui before continuing to Auckland. Tickets were by invitation only.\n\nA series of stamps was issued to commemorate the centennial, see Stamps:\n\nThe NIMT has been described as an \"engineering miracle\", with numerous engineering feats especially along the Rangitikei River and on the North Island Volcanic Plateau. This included the building of the famous Raurimu Spiral to allow trains to ascend the steep grade from the Whanganui River valley to the North Island Volcanic Plateau.\n\nThe NIMT includes 352 bridges and 14 tunnels. The major viaducts include three (North Rangitikei, South Rangitikei and Kawhatau) opened in 1981 for the Mangaweka deviation. Five viaducts are over high. There are smaller viaducts at Taonui north of Ohakune, and Manganui-o-te-Ao and Mangaturutura.\n\nThe heights and lengths of the main viaducts are:\nDue to its high volume and high value of traffic to NZR and the steep grades in the central section, the NIMT has seen the use of the most powerful locomotives in New Zealand.\n\nWhen the NIMT opened in 1909, the powerful 4-8-2 X class was introduced to handle heavy traffic over the mountainous central North Island section.\nThree G class Garratt-type locomotives were introduced in 1928, but these were not as effective as anticipated. In 1932 the 4-8-4 K class was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the K class.\n\nThe introduction of the D class in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the D class locomotive, major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of D class locomotives and the Silver Fern railcars; the latter remaining in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the EF class electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the Midland Line in the South Island. Since then services between Te Rapa and Palmerston North have been worked mainly by the electrics, although some services are still diesel-operated, such as those originating from or terminating on other lines, or originating from within the central section, like the paper pulp freight trains from Karioi.\n\nAs of May 2020, regular rolling stock on the NIMT include:\n\nFrom opening there have been regular passenger services between Wellington and Auckland. The daily \"Express\" left earlier in the evening, followed by the \"Limited\", which had fewer stops for passengers.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1968 daytime trains were called the Scenic Daylight. In 1968, a Drewery RM class articulated 88-seater railcar was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue-and-white scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between Hamilton and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968. Note that all self-propelled passenger railcar classes in New Zealand are generically classed 'RM'.\n\nIn 1971 NZR introduced the Silver Star, a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the Silver Fern, a daytime railcar service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by The Overlander.\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland – Kaimai Express, and Auckland and Rotorua – Geyserland Express, in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the Waikato Connection was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001. In 2019 a new commuter service between Hamilton and Auckland was proposed, to be named through a public competition. The Covid-19 pandemic of 2020 has delayed progress of this proposal.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll (Toll Holdings/Toll NZ) announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced. It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the Northern Explorer, with modern New Zealand-built AK class carriages to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops. It commenced on Monday 25 June 2012, and consists of one train running from Auckland-to-Wellington on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and Wellington-to-Auckland on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. It has fewer stops than the Overlander, stopping only at Papakura, Hamilton, Otorohanga, National Park, Ohakune, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu. Along with the other tourist rail services—the Coastal Pacific and TranzAlpine (both in the South Island), and the Interislander rail-ferry services across Cook Strait, the Northern Explorer is operated by \"The Great Journeys of New Zealand\", a division of KiwiRail.\n\nThe Capital Connection commuter train operates between Palmerston North and Wellington.\n\nBoth KiwiRail and private enthusiast operators such as the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Mainline Steam and Steam Incorporated operate charter trains.\n\nSuburban trains run on the NIMT at regular intervals as follows:\n\nEastern Line (Manukau to Britomart via Glen Innes) trains run on the NIMT between Puhinui and Britomart.\n\nSouthern Line (Papakura to Britomart via Otahuhu and Newmarket) trains run on the NIMT from Papakura to Westfield Junction. They then run on the North Auckland Line to Newmarket, and the Newmarket Line to the vicinity of Quay Park, where they rejoin the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) into Britomart. A diesel train shuttle service runs on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Papakura.\n\nOnehunga Line and Western Line trains use the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) from the vicinity of Quay Park into Britomart.\n\nWellington's Metlink suburban network, operated by Transdev Wellington, includes the southern portion of the NIMT between Wellington and Waikanae as the Kapiti Line.\n\nRecord runs from Auckland to Wellington were the 1960 Moohan Rocket (train) of 11 hours 34 minutes in 1960, and the Standard railcar time of 9 hours 26 minutes (running time 8 hours 42 minutes) in 1967.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "1799177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799177", "title": "Tilt (poker)", "text": "Tilt (poker)\n\nTilt originated as a poker term for a state of mental or emotional confusion or frustration in which a player adopts a less than optimal strategy, usually resulting in the player becoming over-aggressive. Tilting is closely associated with another poker term, \"steam\".\n\nPlacing an opponent on tilt or dealing with being on tilt oneself is an important aspect of poker. It is a relatively frequent occurrence due to frustration, animosity against other players, or simply bad luck.\n\nOne possible origin of the word \"tilt\" is as a reference to tilting a pinball machine. The frustration from seeing the ball follow a path towards the gap between the flippers can lead to the player physically tilting the machine in an attempt to guide the ball towards the flippers. However, in doing so, some games will flash the word \"TILT\" and freeze the flippers, causing the ball to be lost for certain; as in poker, this suggests that over-aggression due to frustration leads to severely detrimental playing techniques.\n\nWhile \"tilting\" originally applied to poker, it has recently become a common term when talking about other games, especially chess and esports titles. Tilting in esports causes players to \"lose control due to anger\".\n\nThe most common cause of tilt is losing, especially being defeated in a particularly public and humiliating fashion. In poker, a bad beat can upset the mental equilibrium essential for optimal poker judgment, causing frustration. Another common cause of tilt is bad manners from other players causing frustration which eventually leads to tilting.\n\nThough not as commonly acknowledged or discussed, it is also quite possible to go on \"winner's tilt\" as a result of a \"positive\" trigger: such as winning unexpectedly, or going on a string of good luck. Strong positive emotions can be just as dizzying and detrimental to one's play as negative ones. Tilting and winner's tilt can both lead to the same habits.\n\nFor the beginning player, the elimination or minimization of tilt is considered an essential improvement that can be made in play (for instance in the strategic advice of Mike Caro). Many advanced players (after logging thousands of table-hours) claim to have outgrown \"tilt\" and frustration, although other poker professionals admit it is still a \"leak\" in their game.\n\nOne commonly suggested way to fight tilt is to disregard the outcomes of pots, particularly those that are statistically uncommon. So-called \"bad beats,\" when one puts a lot of chips in the pot with the best hand and still loses, deserve little thought; they are the product of variance, not bad strategy. This mindset calls for the player to understand poker is a game of decisions and correct play in making the right bets over a long period of time.\n\nAnother method for avoiding tilt is to try lowering one's variance, even if that means winning fewer chips overall. Therefore, one may play passively and fold marginal hands, even though that may mean folding the winning hand. This may also imply that one plays tightly— and looks for advantageous situations.\n\nOnce tilt begins, players are well-advised to leave the table and return when emotions have subsided. When away from the table, players are advised to take time to refresh themselves, eat and drink (non-alcoholic) if necessary, and take a break outside in the fresh air.\n\nIf none of these work in lessening tilt, players are advised to leave the game and not return to playing until they have shaken off the results that led to the tilt.\n\nThe intent of the advice is to prevent the upset person from letting negative emotions lead to bigger losses that can seriously hurt one's bankroll.\n\nTilt must be taken seriously, requiring immediate attention following its presence. The progression in poker for chronically tilted players may be significantly hindered as their judgement becomes progressively impaired as agitation becomes more prominent. Paying close attention to playing statistics can assist in preventing this, as a statistical overview of recent hands can reduce the players likelihood to play impulsive hands habitually.\n\nThe act of putting an opponent on tilt may not pay off in the short run, but if some time is put into practicing it, a player can quickly become an expert at \"tilting\" other players (with or without using bad manners). In theory, the long-run payoff of this tactic is a monetarily positive expectation.\n\nCommon methods of putting a table on tilt include:\n\nThese antics can upset the other players at the table with the intention of getting them to play poorly.\n\n"}

As a right back Howe featured for clubs West Bromwich Albion and Arsenal together with the English national football team in his playing career. He also went on to manage sides West Brom, Galatasaray, Queens Park Rangers and Coventry City. Howe was also a successful coach and has been described as one of the most influential figures of the English footballing game.\n\nHowe was born in the Springfield area of Wolverhampton in 1935 and spent his secondary education at St Peter's Collegiate School.\n\nHowe joined the West Bromwich Albion ground staff after leaving school, joining the club as a youth player in December 1950. He turned professional in November 1952, but did not make his debut until 1955, against Everton. Playing as a full back, Howe went on to win the FA Cup of 1954 with West Brom. In all he played 379 league and cup games scoring 19 goals for the Baggies in twelve years.\n\nHowe was signed by Billy Wright's Arsenal in 1964, and was made club captain. However, in March 1966 he broke his leg playing against Blackpool and only played two further first team games both in September 1966. Firstly against Manchester City in the League on the 10th and then on the 13th against Gillingham in the League Cup. Altogether Howe was capped 70 times for Arsenal.\n\nIn 2004, he was named as one of West Bromwich Albion's 16 greatest players, in a poll organised as part of the club's 125th anniversary celebrations.\n\nHowe retired from playing and became Arsenal's reserve team coach under Bertie Mee, then stepping up to first team coach after the departure of Dave Sexton in October 1967. Arsenal won the Double in 1971 with Howe playing a crucial role.\n\nNot long afterward he returned to his old club, West Bromwich Albion, as manager. Howe's tenure at WBA was not a success, as the club were relegated to Division Two in 1973. Howe then joined Leeds United as a coach, later becoming assistant manager under Jimmy Armfield, before moving on to manage Turkish club Galatasaray in 1975. Howe rejoined Arsenal in 1977 as head coach, under Terry Neill.\n\nAfter Neill's sacking on 16 December 1983, Howe became Arsenal caretaker-manager and was appointed permanently after the game against Leicester City on 28 April 1984. Despite introducing young players including Tony Adams, David Rocastle and Niall Quinn to the team during the mid-1980s, he was unable to win trophies, as Arsenal finished either 6th or 7th under him, although they did briefly top the league in October 1984.\n\nAfter just over two years in the job, Howe resigned on 22 March 1986, shortly after Arsenal's match against Coventry City. George Graham succeeded him. This was subsequent to circulated reports that the board were looking at the time at FC Barcelona manager Terry Venables.\n\nHowe later joined Wimbledon as assistant to Bobby Gould in 1987, and helped them win the FA Cup with a shock win over Liverpool in 1988. His coaching expertise earned him a great deal of credit for Wimbledon's cup triumph.\n\nHowe then left Wimbledon to manage QPR between November 1989 and May 1991, with Gould briefly assisting him in the first half of the 1990–91 season.\n\nIn early 1992, Howe assisted Barry Fry with defensive work at Barnet\n\nShortly after leaving QPR, he became assistant manager to Terry Butcher at Coventry City and became manager in January 1992 when Butcher was sacked. Howe secured a place in the new FA Premier League for Coventry, who missed relegation by one place, and just after the end of the 1991–92 season Gould rejoined him as joint manager of the Highfield Road club. However, Howe resigned as manager before the 1992–93 season began.\nHe returned to Arsenal in 1997 as part of the Academy setup wherein as the head youth coach.\n\nHowe also moved into journalism and broadcasting, becoming a pundit for Channel 4's coverage of Serie A.\n\nAs a defender, he featured regularly in the England national football team. Howe played in the 1958 FIFA World Cup, and altogether won 23 caps in total for the Three Lions.\n\nHe became part of the England national team's coaching setup in 1981, working under Ron Greenwood. When Greenwood retired a year later, Howe continued to work for the national team under new manager Bobby Robson.\n\nHowe became assistant for England under Terry Venables from January 1994 to June 1996, finishing with England's semi final appearance as host nation at Euro 96.\n\nHowe retired from coaching in the summer of 2003 after more than 30 years.

She was the daughter of Quintus Aquilius, twice consul under Caracalla. The \"praenomen\" of Julia was given to her after becoming an empress.\n\nSevera was a Vestal Virgin and, as such, her marriage to Elagabalus in late 220 was the cause of enormous controversy – traditionally, the punishment for breaking the thirty-year vow of celibacy was death by being buried alive. Elagabalus is believed to have had religious reasons for marrying Severa – he himself was a follower of the eastern sun god El-Gabal, and when marrying himself to Severa, he also conducted a symbolic marriage of his god to Vesta. \n\nBoth these marriages were revoked shortly afterwards, however. This was possibly on the urging of Julia Maesa, the grandmother who had engineered Elagabalus' rise to the imperial throne. Elagabalus then married Annia Faustina, a more generally acceptable choice to the senatorial elite. Within a short time, however, Elagabalus had divorced Faustina and returned to living with Severa, claiming that the original divorce was invalid. It is believed that Severa remained with Elagabalus until his assassination in 222. The two are not believed to have had any children. \n\nSevera's own opinions about the entire affair are not very well recorded. Some sources state that she was forced to marry against her will, and others go further, alleging rape. It is claimed by some historians, however, that many stories about Elagabalus have been exaggerated by his enemies, and so there is no certainty about what actually happened. It is unclear whether Elagabalus had any real feelings towards Severa, or whether he was more concerned with the symbolism of the marriage. Elagabalus also had relationships with men, and the historian Cassius Dio claims that Elagabalus had a more stable relationship with his chariot driver, Hierocles, than with any of his wives.\n\n"}

He was the President of the National Assembly of Togo from September 2000 to February 2005. He is a prominent member of the ruling Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) and is a member of the Pan-African Parliament representing Togo.\n\nNatchaba was born in Gando, Togo. He was Director of the Cabinet of President Gnassingbé Eyadéma from 1977 to 1981 and was a member of the National Committee in charge of drafting the text of the 1980 Constitution. He was an RPT Delegate to the Togolese National Conference in 1991 and was Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation from 14 September 1992 to 20 March 1994.\n\nHe was first elected to the National Assembly in February 1994, representing Oti Prefecture in Savanes Region. He was re-elected in the March 1999 parliamentary election as the RPT candidate in the Third Constituency of Oti Prefecture; he faced no opposition and won the seat with 100% of the vote. He was President of the RPT Parliamentary Group and First Vice-President of the National Assembly before being elected as President of the National Assembly on 3 September 2000. Following the October 2002 parliamentary election, he was re-elected as President of the National Assembly, with 73 votes in favor, three opposed, one null vote, and one abstention. When the Pan-African Parliament began meeting in March 2004, Natchaba became one of Togo's five members.\n\nPresident Eyadéma died on 5 February 2005. Soon after his death, the armed forces sealed Togo's borders with neighboring countries and invested presidential powers in his son Fauré. These moves were in direct contrast to the country's constitution, which stated that the President of National Assembly would serve as acting President of Togo for 60 days until a new election was held. Natchaba, who was in Benin at the time of Eyadéma's death, was unable to return to Togo. The military's actions were condemned by the international community as a \"coup d'etat\".\n\nOn 6 February 2005, the National Assembly voted to remove Natchaba as its President and Fauré Gnassingbé was unanimously elected to head the National Assembly as a means of legitimizing his succession. Following increased pressure both inside and outside of Togo, Gnassingbé resigned on 25 February and Bonfoh Abbass was designated as President of the National Assembly, thereby becoming acting President of Togo. Natchaba said that it was \"unconstitutional\" to bypass him and install Gnassingbé as President, and he said that he was the legitimate President.\n\nAccompanied by President Mathieu Kérékou of Benin, Fambaré Natchaba returned to Togo on 5 March 2005. They met with senior army, government, and RPT officials. Before departing, Kérékou reportedly told leading RPT officials: \"I've brought Natchaba to you. He is your brother and has no other option but to reunite with his political family and work within the ranks of the RPT, to perpetuate Eyadéma's legacy.\"\n\nLater in 2005, President Gnassingbé designated Natchaba as his special envoy to the European Parliament and the European Commission.\n\nAt the 2006 Inter-Togolese Dialogue, Natchaba signed the Global Political Accord on the electoral process on behalf of the RPT on 20 August 2006. He is a member of the RPT Political Bureau and a member of the RPT Central Committee from Oti Prefecture as of the RPT's Ninth Ordinary Congress in December 2006. He sought to stand as an RPT candidate in Oti Prefecture in the October 2007 parliamentary election, but he was defeated in the party's primary election on April 7, 2007.\n\nFollowing the arrest of Gnassingbé's brother Kpatcha Gnassingbé in April 2009, Natchaba characterized it as \"just an incident\" lacking any broader importance. He stressed that \"there is no other solution than to continue on the road of democracy. The Eyadema era is well and truly over\".\n\nNatchaba is married and the father of five children.\n"}

Thomas (1874–1958) was a Canadian-born American industrialist and entrepreneur. He was trained as a millsmith (specifically in woodworking), and moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where he was employed by a streetcar manufacturer.\n\nThomas was born on a farm outside of Chatham, Ontario, grew up in the area and in 1901 he moved to the US settling in Detroit.\n\nHe attended night courses at Case Institute of Technology, and learned technical drawing, design skills, and structural engineering. As the streetcar manufacturers transitioned from wooden to steel construction, his expertise allowed him to accept a better offer with Southern Car Company in High Point, North Carolina, where he became chief engineer, and he and his wife moved south in 1910. Thomas became chief engineer, draftsman and designer for the company, using both his mechanical skills and his experience as a skilled woodworker. After he was laid off there when the company folded in 1916, he was persuaded to undertake a contract to renovate streetcars for the Southern Public Utilities Company of Charlotte, North Carolina, using Southern's former facilities and many of its employees. The following year, he organized Perley A. Thomas Car Works, which became famous for its streetcars.\n\nPerley A. Thomas streetcars were renowned for their expert craftsmanship and solid construction, and operated in many large North American cities, including Detroit, Michigan, New York City, Miami, Florida and San Juan, Puerto Rico. A famous Tennessee Williams play and later film of the same name was set in New Orleans, Louisiana, where Perley A. Thomas streetcars were operated on the route labeled \"Desire\" around the period of 1947 in which the story was set; hence the name: \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". Late in the 20th century, local employees carefully restored the cars, which operate on a heritage streetcar system.\n\nAs he had noted and taken advantage of the transition from wooden to steel streetcars, he also recognized the transition from streetcars to buses which North America was undergoing in the 1930s. Thomas guided his company through a transition to bus manufacturing in 1936.\n\nThe Perley A. Thomas Car Works was later reorganized as Thomas Built Buses, Inc., and became one of the three principal builders of large school buses in the United States by the end of the 20th century.

She accepted the suit of William I of Orange, and they were married on 25 August 1561.\n\nAfter the death of her younger brother Albert (born November 28, 1545 † April 12, 1546), Anna grew up as an only child, and might have been spoiled by her parents, particularly her mother. There are indications that Anna suffered from a physical deformity (a back problem or uneven shoulders) and that she might have walked with a limp.\n\nAfter her father's death on 11 July 1553, his younger brother, August (1526–1586), succeeded him as Elector of Saxony, resulting in a loss of Anna's in rank. Shortly afterwards, Anna's mother married Duke Johann Friedrich II of Saxony (1529–1595). On 4 November 1555, six months after her second marriage, her mother died under mysterious circumstances. The 11-year-old orphan then returned to her late father's Dresden court and was placed under the guardianship of her uncle August and his wife, Anne of Denmark and Norway. Sources indicate that the young princess chafed under her aunt's regime, was often unhappy and felt alone. At the same time, she was described as proud, defiant, and stubborn as well as intelligent and passionate.\n\nDue to her late parents' legacies, Anna was considered the wealthiest heiress in Germany at the time. In 1556, Erik, son of the Swedish king Gustav Vasa, sought her hand in marriage, followed two years later by William of Orange. A marriage with a rich heiress and relation to the important electoral houses of Germany for him seemed of great value. Money may have not been one of the main motives for the marriage, but was probably the furthest planned course of the marriage. Anna's maternal grandfather, Philip the Magnanimous of Hesse, was opposed to the marriage. First, he did not consider William of Orange, already having a male heir, as befitting for an elector's daughter, believing she could marry someone of even higher rank. Secondly, there would have been too much debt incurred in the event of William's death. Philip's negative attitude delayed the marriage for a full year. Ultimately, however, the decisive factor was probably that William was a valuable ally for Germany and his Dutch resources for the Protestant cause.\n\nOn 2 June 1561 the marriage contract was signed in Torgau. Anna's dowry would be the large sum of 100,000 thalers. The wedding took place on 24 August 1561 in Leipzig. On 1 September 1561 William of Orange, along with his young wife, relocated to the Netherlands.\n\nThe marriage produced five children, of whom three survived to adulthood:\n\nJust a few months after the wedding, in 1562 difficulties arose between her and her husband. Anna received letters from her uncle meant for William stating he should work more towards pleasing her. Both tried to end the rumours that they had an unhappy marriage. By 1565, it was well known in all the courts of Germany and the Netherlands that the marriage was an unhappy one. Her uncle August tried to save face by making claims that disputes arose due to his brother Louis antagonizing William. In 1566 William finally complained about the \"contentious\" nature of his wife to her Saxon uncle August and her Hessian uncle Landgrave Wilhelm IV of Hesse-Kassel (1532–1592).\n\nAfter the death of her first son Maurice in 1566, Anna fell to severe depression and suicidal thoughts for the first time. She also tried to drown her grief with excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nIn 1567 William had to flee due to his opposition to the Habsburg Netherlands, and went with his wife to Dillenburg, the German headquarters of the family. On 14 November 1567 she bore a son and named him Maurice again. At the baptism of 11–19 January 1568 a message arrived for William in Burgundy stating that on 20 December 1567 all his Dutch lands and possessions had been confiscated.\n\nWhen Wilhelm on 15 August 1568 went back to Brabant to continue his war against the Spaniards, Anna decided on 20 October 1568 although pregnant again, to leave Dillenburg with her court (probably 43 people), to escape the antipathies of his mother and to create a new home in Cologne. Their two children, Anna and Maurits, had been taken by her mother-in-law to Braunfels due to the risk of disease. The next year, after a fierce battle with William's mother, she was able to bring her children back to him. Her daughter Emilia was born on 10 April 1569 in Cologne.\n\nOn 4 March 1569 Anna met her husband in Mannheim. William's campaign against the Duke of Alba had failed, and King Philip II of Spain had forced him out. After this, he left Germany and went to support the Huguenots in France in their faith struggles. Since William could no longer provide for the family, Anna looked to other means of support. She considered either persuading the Duke of Alba returning their confiscated goods, or demanding payment from Wilhelm as specified in the contract of 12,000 guilders or the castles of Diez or Hadamar. This would have meant a severe financial burden to be borne for Nassau. Anna became a substantial risk to the family.\n\nTo enforce their claims, they purchased the services of the successful lawyer Jan Rubens in the end of January 1569, the father of the painter Peter Paul Rubens, who had left Antwerp because of his Calvinist faith in 1568, and found refuge in Cologne. The case was begun in January 1570 at the Royal Brussels to take fiscal action for their confiscated goods in the Netherlands.\n\nAnna desired to see her husband again and met with him in May 1570 in Butzbach to discuss financial matters as well as other important topics. In June 1570, Anna and William moved in together again in Siegen for a few weeks, where she had settled with her three children. It was there where she began an affair with her lawyer Jan Rubens.\n\nDuring the Christmas holidays from 24 to 26 December 1570 William visited his family there again. It was likely a harmonious time, because he persuaded Anna to visit him in January 1571 in Dillenburg, where she even was willing to forego, for the time, payments from her jointure. She was pregnant again, this time from her lover. William accused Anna of adultery at this point and made plans to separate from her.\n\nRubens was often with Anna because he was their counsellor, financial advisor and attorney, and thus was suspected of adultery with Anna between 7 and 10 March 1571. He was arrested outside the city of Siegen when he was on his way to see her. He was blackmailed for a suitable confession. Anna was put under pressure too: either they must confess themselves or Rubens would be executed. Anna agreed on 26 March 1571 to plead guilty. On 22 August 1571 Anna's last child, Christine, was born. On the basis of the allegation, William of Orange didn't recognize the child as his daughter. Christine received the name \"van Dietz\". On 14 December 1571 Anna had to sign their consent to the final separation from her husband. In addition, William of Orange was not willing to pay maintenance for her.\n\nIn September 1572 Anna decided to challenge the Imperial Court's ruling for her financial rights. At this time her Hessian and Saxon relatives had already made plans to turn Beilstein castle into a prison, to hold her captive as an adulteress. On 1 October 1572, she was brought there with her youngest daughter Christine. Three years later, her daughter was taken from her.\n\nIn March of that year, although the divorce was not finalized, the first news appeared of an impending remarriage of William of Orange. His chosen wife was the former Abbess of Jouarre, Charlotte de Bourbon-Montpensier, a daughter of Louis II of Bourbon, Duke of Montpensier, and his first wife, Jacqueline de Longwy. Outraged at this news, some of Anna's relatives demanded the return of large wedding gifts despite her possible infidelity. Her Uncle August also demanded of William, whom he now called \"Head of all the rogues and rebels \" claimed one of the counties of Nassau, Hadamar and Diez. He also insisted that the marriage of the prince was not legally ended yet, and thus he had no right to remarry or confiscate her property. Anna did not admit her adultery in court, and if she did, then she could have proven that the prince had broken his marriage agreement. He also ordered the immediate transfer of his niece from Nassau to Saxony.\n\nWhen Anna learned in December 1575 of her upcoming transferral to Saxony, she attempted suicide. After a long stay in Zeitz, she was taken to Dresden in December 1576. There, the windows of her room were walled up and fitted with additional iron bars. At the door was a square hole in the top panel that provided a narrow grid, which was closed off outside. Through this hole food and drinks were served to her. At the door there was also another iron gate, virtually guaranteeing no chance of escape.\n\nAs of May 1577, Anna was continuously hemorrhaging. She died on 18 December 1577, shortly before her 33rd birthday. Her bones reportedly lie in the cathedral of Meissen near her ancestors in a nameless tomb.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1799250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799250", "title": "Cardiolipin", "text": "Cardiolipin\n\nCardiolipin (IUPAC name 1,3-bis(\"sn\"-3’-phosphatidyl)-\"sn\"-glycerol, also known as Calcutta antigen) is an important component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it constitutes about 20% of the total lipid composition. It can also be found in the membranes of most bacteria. The name \"cardiolipin\" is derived from the fact that it was first found in animal hearts. It was first isolated from beef heart in the early 1940s. In mammalian cells, but also in plant cells, cardiolipin (CL) is found almost exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it is essential for the optimal function of numerous enzymes that are involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism.\n\nCardiolipin (CL) is a kind of diphosphatidylglycerol lipid. Two phosphatidic acid moieties connect with a glycerol backbone in the center to form a dimeric structure. So it has four alkyl groups and potentially carries two negative charges. As there are four distinct alkyl chains in cardiolipin, the potential for complexity of this molecule species is enormous. However, in most animal tissues, cardiolipin contains 18-carbon fatty alkyl chains with 2 unsaturated bonds on each of them. It has been proposed that the (18:2)4 acyl chain configuration is an important structural requirement for the high affinity of CL to inner membrane proteins in mammalian mitochondria. However, studies with isolated enzyme preparations indicate that its importance may vary depending on the protein examined.\n\nSince there are two phosphates in the molecule, each of them can catch one proton. Although it has a symmetric structure, ionizing one phosphate happens at a very different levels of acidity than ionizing both: pK = 3 and pK > 7.5. So under normal physiological conditions (wherein pH is around 7), the molecule may carry only one negative charge. The hydroxyl groups (–OH and –O) on phosphate would form a stable intramolecular hydrogen bond with the centered glycerol's hydroxyl group, thus forming a bicyclic resonance structure. This structure traps one proton, which is quite helpful for oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nAs the head group forms such compact bicycle structure, the head group area is quite small relative to the big tail region consisting of 4 acyl chains. Based on this special structure, the fluorescent mitochondrial indicator, nonyl acridine orange (NAO) was introduced in 1982, and was later found to target mitochondria by binding to CL. NAO has a very large head and small tail structure which can compensate with cardiolipin's small head large tail structure, and arrange in a highly ordered way. Several studies were published utilizing NAO both as a quantitative mitochondrial indicator and an indicator of CL content in mitochondria. However, NAO is influenced by membrane potential and/or the spatial arrangement of CL, so it's not proper to use NAO for CL or mitochondria quantitative studies of intact respiring mitochondria. But NAO still represents a simple method of assessing CL content. \n\nIn eukaryotes such as yeasts, plants and animals, the synthesis processes are believed to happen in mitochondria. The first step is the acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate by a glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. Then acylglycerol-3-phosphate can be once more acylated to form a phosphatidic acid (PA). With the help of the enzyme CDP-DAG synthase (CDS) (phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase), PA is converted into cytidinediphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG). The following step is conversion of CDP-DAG to phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) by the enzyme PGP synthase, followed by dephosphorylation by PTPMT1 to form PG. Finally, a molecule of CDP-DAG is bound to PG to form one molecule of cardiolipin, catalyzed by the mitochondria-localized enzyme cardiolipin synthase (CLS).\n\nIn prokaryotes such as bacteria, diphosphatidylglycerol synthase catalyses a transfer of the phosphatidyl moiety of one phosphatidylglycerol to the free 3'-hydroxyl group of another, with the elimination of one molecule of glycerol, via the action of an enzyme related to phospholipase D. The enzyme can operate in reverse under some physiological conditions to remove cardiolipin.\n\nCatabolism of cardiolipin may happen by the catalysis of phospholipase A2 (PLA) to remove fatty acyl groups. Phospholipase D (PLD) in the mitochondrion hydrolyses cardiolipin to phosphatidic acid.\n\nBecause of cardiolipin's unique structure, a change in pH and the presence of divalent cations can induce a structural change. CL shows a great variety of forms of aggregates. It is found that in the presence of Ca or other divalent cations, CL can be induced to have a lamellar-to-hexagonal (L-H) phase transition. And it is believed to have a close connection with membrane fusion.\n\nThe enzyme cytochrome c oxidase or Complex IV is a large transmembrane protein complex found in bacteria and the mitochondrion. It is the last enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain of mitochondria (or bacteria) located in the mitochondrial (or bacterial) membrane. It receives an electron from each of four cytochrome c molecules, and transfers them to one oxygen molecule, converting molecular oxygen to two molecules of water. Complex IV has been shown to require two associated CL molecules in order to maintain its full enzymatic function. \nCytochrome bc1(Complex III) also needs cardiolipin to maintain its quaternary structure and functional role. Complex V of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery also displays high binding affinity for CL, binding four molecules of CL per molecule of complex V. \n\nCardiolipin distribution to the outer mitochondrial membrane would lead to apoptosis of the cells, as evidenced by cytochrome c (cyt c) release, Caspase-8 activation, MOMP induction and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. During apoptosis, cyt c is released from the intermembrane spaces of mitochondria\ninto the cytosol. Cyt c can then bind to the IP3 receptor on endoplasmic reticulum, stimulating calcium release, which then reacts back to cause the release of cyt c. When the calcium concentration reaches a toxic level, this causes cell death. Cytochrome c is thought to play a role in apoptosis via the release of apoptotic factors from the mitochondria.\nA cardiolipin-specific oxygenase produces CL hydroperoxides which can result in the conformation change of the lipid. The oxidized CL transfers from the inner membrane to the outer membrane, and then helps to form a permeable pore which releases cyt c.\n\nDuring the oxidative phosphorylation process catalyzed by Complex IV, large quantities of protons are transferred from one side of the membrane to another side causing a large pH change. CL is suggested to function as a proton trap within the mitochondrial membranes, thereby strictly localizing the proton pool and minimizing the changes in pH in the mitochondrial intermembrane space.\n\nThis function is due to CL's unique structure. As stated above, CL can trap a proton within the bicyclic structure while carrying a negative charge. Thus, this bicyclic structure can serve as an electron buffer pool to release or absorb protons to maintain the pH near the membranes.\n\n\nBarth syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that was recognised in the 1970s to cause infantile death. It has a mutation in the gene coding for tafazzin, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cardiolipin. Tafazzin is an indispensable enzyme to synthesize cardiolipin in eukaryotes involved in the remodeling of CL acyl chains by transferring linoleic acid from PC to monolysocardiolipin. Mutation of tafazzin would cause insufficient cardiolipin remodeling. However, it appears that cells compensate and ATP production is similar or higher than normal cells. \nFemales heterozygous for the trait are unaffected. Sufferers of this condition have mitochondria that are abnormal. Cardiomyopathy and general weakness is common to these patients.\n\nOxidative stress and lipid peroxidation are believed to be contributing factors leading to neuronal loss and mitochondrial dysfunction in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease, and may play an early role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. It is reported that CL content in the brain decreases with aging, and a recent study on rat brain shows it results from lipid peroxidation in mitochondria exposed to free radical stress. Another study shows that the CL biosynthesis pathway may be selectively impaired, causing 20% reduction and composition change of the CL content. It's also associated with a 15% reduction in linked complex I/III activity of the electron transport chain, which is thought to be a critical factor in the development of Parkinson's disease.\n\nRecently, it is reported that in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and heart failure, decreased CL levels and change in acyl chain composition are also observed in the mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the role of CL in aging and ischemia/reperfusion is still controversial.\n\nTangier disease is also linked to CL abnormalities. Tangier disease is characterized by very low blood plasma levels of High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (\"good cholesterol\"), accumulation of cholesteryl esters in tissues, and an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Unlike Barth syndrome, Tangier disease is mainly caused by abnormal enhanced production of CL. Studies show that there are three to fivefold increase of CL level in Tangier disease. Because increased CL levels would enhance cholesterol oxidation, and then the formation of oxysterols would consequently increase cholesterol efflux. This process could function as an escape mechanism to remove excess cholesterol from the cell.\n\nHeart disease is twice as common in people with diabetes. In diabetics, cardiovascular complications occur at an earlier age and often result in premature death, making heart disease the major killer of diabetic people. Cardiolipin has been found to be deficient in the heart at the earliest stages of diabetes, possibly due to a lipid-digesting enzyme that becomes more active in diabetic heart muscle.\n\nCardiolipin from a cow heart is used as an antigen in the Wassermann test for syphilis. Anti-cardiolipin antibodies can also be increased in numerous other conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, malaria and tuberculosis, so this test is not specific.\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) has infected more than 60 million people worldwide. HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein contains at least four sites for neutralizing antibodies. Among these sites, the membrane-proximal region (MPR) is particularly attractive as an antibody target because it facilitates viral entry into T cells and is highly conserved among viral strains. However, it is found that two antibodies directed against 2F5, 4E10 in MPR react with self-antigens, including cardiolipin. Thus, it's difficult for such antibodies to be elicited by vaccination.\n\nIt was first proposed by Otto Heinrich Warburg that cancer originated from irreversible injury to mitochondrial respiration, but the structural basis for this injury has remained elusive. Since cardiolipin is an important phospholipid found almost exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane and very essential in maintaining mitochondrial function, it is suggested that abnormalities in CL can impair mitochondrial function and bioenergetics. A study published in 2008 on mouse brain tumors supporting Warburg's cancer theory shows major abnormalities in CL content or composition in all tumors.\n\nPatients with anti-cardiolipin antibodies (Antiphospholipid syndrome) can have recurrent thrombotic events even early in their mid- to late-teen years. These events can occur in vessels in which thrombosis may be relatively uncommon, such as the hepatic or renal veins. These antibodies are usually picked up in young women with recurrent spontaneous abortions.\nIn anti-cardiolipin-mediated autoimmune disease, there is a dependency on the apolipoprotein H for recognition.\n\nBartonellosis is a serious chronic bacterial infection shared by both cats and humans. Spinella found that one patient with bartonella henselae also had anti-cardiolipin antibodies, suggesting that bartonella may trigger their production.\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome is debilitating illness of unknown cause that often follows an acute viral infection. According to one research study, 95% of CFS patients have anti-cardiolipin antibodies.\n\n\n"}

He was the inventor of the modern recording console and is recognised as a key figure in the development of the postwar commercial recording industry.\n\nFormer colleague Bruce Swedien described Putnam's achievements thus:\n\nPutnam was the first person in the US to use artificial reverberation using echo chambers for commercial recording. He also developed the first US multi-band audio equalizer, and with his companies Universal Audio and later Universal Recording Electronics Industries (UREI), he was responsible for the development of classic recording studio equipment. This included the vacuum tube based LA-2A and 176 compressors, and their transistor based successors, the LA-3A and 1176. He also developed the Time Align Monitor Series, and custom order Studio Electronics recordings consoles, outfitted with his 610 modular channel strips, all of which soon became standard equipment in studios all over America. Alongside his friend Les Paul, Putnam was also involved in the early development of stereophonic recording and he founded several major independent recording studios in Chicago, Las Vegas, Hollywood and San Francisco.\n\nIn 1947, Putnam made the first recording of a single artist singing more than one line on a recording made with Patti Page and George Barnes (musician), who suggested the \"duet.\" Page sang one vocal line of \"Confess\", and the second part was recorded onto a large 17.25\" disc, then played back as she sang the main vocal line; the two vocals and accompaniment being wedded onto a wire recorder. Les Paul followed in short order with his own quite different technique for doubling vocals.\n\nIn 1946, Putnam founded one of America's first independent recording studios, Universal Recording in Chicago. His reputation grew quickly thanks to his work with artists such as Patti Page, Vic Damone, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Sarah Vaughan, Little Walter, and Dinah Washington. His period at Universal saw a number of 'firsts' for the recording industry, including the first use of tape repeat, the first vocal booth, the first multiple voice recording, one of the first to use 8-track recording (preceded by Les Paul and Tom Dowd), the first use of delay lines in the studio, and the first release, in 1956, of half-speed mastered discs (on the Mercury label.)\n\nBy the mid-1950s, Putnam was one of the most sought-after engineer-producers in the United States. Sam Phillips sent Elvis Presley's \"Mystery Train\" and \"I Forgot to Remember to Forget\" to Putnam in August, 1955 with the instructions: \"Give me 'hot' level on both 78 and 45's and as much presence peak and bass as possible!\" Universal Recording had become so successful that clients including Nelson Riddle, Mitch Miller and Quincy Jones began urging him to open a facility on the west coast. In 1957, he sold his interest in Universal Recording and with support from Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby, he established a new company called United Recording Corp. and moved to Hollywood, taking over and remodeling a defunct film studio at 6050 Sunset Boulevard. Putnam was determined to incorporate as many technological innovations into the new complex as possible and he constructed new facilities, including a significant modernization of studio control room concept to permit multi-track monitoring and recording, featuring Putnam's innovative Bonnet design to provide overhead forward speaker mounting and provide seating space for guests while improving the engineer's view of the studio. Until that time, control rooms were typically small booths. These new control rooms also housed new multi-channel custom consoles designed and manufactured in a second story loft area of the building (the birthplace of UREI). United's facilities included three acoustically isolated studios of varying sizes, three lacquer mastering studios (one stereo) and a stereo re-mixing room. In addition, each studio had its own stereo acoustic reverberation room. All facilities were cross connected electronically at a central location so that all facilities were available to each other as needed.\n\nWhen United Recording was founded, stereo recording was still a new innovation and it was considered little more than a novelty by the major record labels. But Putnam foresaw its importance and, at his own expense, he began making simultaneous stereo mixes of recordings produced at United Western and stockpiled these recordings. Around 1962, when stereo was taking off as a consumer audio format, the major labels found themselves without any significant back catalog of stereo recordings, so they offered to buy the stockpile of tapes. However, the canny Putnam cleverly negotiated a far more lucrative deal, whereby he was recompensed for the (much more expensive) studio time used in mixing the stereo versions. According to Putnam's former associate, Allen Sides, at this time the studio was bringing in around US$200,000 per month in studio billing (equivalent to US$ per month today).\n\nIn 1961, he acquired the neighboring Western Recorders, located at 6000 Sunset, remodeled it and incorporated it into the complex, which was then renamed United Western Recorders. The two buildings were then tied together electronically also to provide flexibility. United Recording Electronic Industries (UREI), having outgrown the loft facilities above United moved into an area in the East wing of the Western Recorders building. It moved again a few years later to much larger headquarters in North Hollywood. Putnam finally sold UREI to Harmon Industries who also owned JBL at the time.\n\nIn 1966, Putnam sold the Nevada location of United Recording to Bill Porter.\n\nAfter the United/Western merger, and at the request of several film music producers in Hollywood who were looking for a more modern sound for their films, the studios began to record film scores utilizing multi-track film recorders. Playing video cues and sync recording mono audio for quick playback in the studio was also a very popular time saver.\n\nIn 1985, Putnam sold the original studio to Allen Sides, who then renamed it Oceanway Recording.\n\nBill Putnam's father ran a radio program at WDZ, Tuscola, Illinois, one of Gene Autry's early radio homes. Born in Danville, Illinois, Putnam's interest in music began in this period, and his flair for electronics started when he was in the Boy Scouts working toward a 'wireless' merit badge. At thirteen, he tried and failed to become a licensed Ham operator but at fifteen he succeeded, earning a Class B Call sign WA9PUK. On weekends, Putnam sang with a number of regional bands that played gigs primarily on college campuses. It was at this point that Putnam realized that musicians were his favorite people. Putnam was married four times. His first wife Grace elected to stay in Danville, Ill. with their son and daughter when Bill joined the U.S. Army Band and was stationed near the North Side of Chicago. After his discharge from the Army, he got a divorce and formed a partnership with two other like minded individuals, Bernie Clapper and Bob Weber, to make time delayed transcriptions of Network radio shows. They later started Universal Recording Corp.on the eighth floor of the old Opera Building in Chicago. After several moves, they built their newest and last Studio on the second floor of a new building on the N.E. corner of Rush and Walton Streets in the Club District on the North Side. It was here that he met a singer by the name of Belinda Richmond at one of the nearby clubs and the two were married. Belinda worked at the studios as a tape editor and part time file librarian. Bill Putnam's long hours at Universal Recording again led to divorce after moving to Hollywood. Putnam met and married Frank Sinatra's assistant Miriam (also known as 'Tookie') and fathered two more sons, Bill Jr. and Jim. Miriam died after a bout with cancer and Bill did not marry again until after he sold the company and retired whereupon he married Carole and moved to Ventura Keys, California.\n\nPutnam died in Riverside, California at the age of 69, and was laid to rest in Valley Oaks Memorial Park in Westlake Village, Ca.

A Shigaraki Kōgen Railway (SKR) train and a West Japan Railway Company (JR West) train collided head-on, killing 42 people and injuring 614 others. Until the Amagasaki rail crash in 2005, this was the deadliest railway disaster in Japan since the Yokohama rail crash of 1963, which killed 161 people.\n\nThe accident happened at 10:35 (1:35 UTC) local time on May 14, 1991, on the SKR Shigaraki Line between Onotani Signal Station and Shigarakigūshi. \n\nA special JR West rapid service train (501D) from Kyoto bound for Shigaraki had entered the Shigaraki Line at Kibukawa Station from the Kusatsu Line, transporting 716 passengers to the World Ceramic Festival that was being held in Shigaraki at the time.\n\nGoing in the opposite direction, an SKR local train (534D) had left Shigaraki and headed for Kibukawa, despite a red signal. \n\nThe was the only point on the single-track line where two trains can safely pass, but the JR West train had already gone past that signal station, as it was given a green signal despite the approaching SKR train. The signal station has been deactivated since the disaster.\n\nThe primary causes of the accidents were SKR officials allowing the eastbound SKR train to pass red signals and the failed interlocking that allowed the westbound JR West train to advance past Onotani Signal Station. Both SKR and JR West had independently made unauthorized modification to the signal system, which led to the confusion that prompted the SKR staff to send a train against a red signal, and the faulty wiring that showed the JR West train a green signal, when the approaching SKR train should have turned the signal to red.\n\nSKR suspended passenger service while the Shiga Prefecture and Ministry of Transport conducted investigations, and service did not reopen until December 1991. When service resumed, the use of Onotani Signal Station as a passing point was discontinued. As a result, service frequency was reduced from twice an hour to once an hour, with operation in only one direction at any time. \n\nIn 1999, the two companies have had a complaint set against them for having negligence for the victims of the train disaster. In the same year, the two companies were put on trial in the Ōtsu District Court. In 2002, in the Osaka High Court, the West Japan Railway Company was found guilty of negligence. The West Japan Railway Company however did not appeal against the verdict of the High Court.\n\nJR West discontinued through train operations to the Shigaraki Line, while other Japan Railways Group companies similarly discontinued non-regular through train operations to private and Third Sector railway lines. \n\nThe World Ceramic Festival, which was to continue until May 26, was cancelled the day following the accident.\n\n\n"}

She is best known for being a songwriter, guitarist and singer in the shoegazing/Britpop band Lush.\n\nBorn in Wimbledon, London, the adopted daughter of a former army officer who ran a gentleman's club in Piccadilly, Anderson attended several private schools before taking her O-Levels at Queen's College, where she met Miki Berenyi. As keen music fans, they wrote a fanzine called \"Alphabet Soup\". Her first band, which she joined in 1986, was The Rover Girls (which featured Chris P Mowforth and Stuart Watson, who were both later in Silverfish) as a bass player.\n\nIn 1987, while Anderson was at Ealing College of Higher Education studying Humanities and Berenyi was at North London Polytechnic, they formed Lush. On 6 March 1988, Lush played their very first performance at the Camden Falcon in London. They went on to reasonable success, having a number of Top 40 hits over an eight-year career. Anderson told Everett True in \"Melody Maker\", \"I remember when I couldn't play, I wasn't in a band, didn't know anyone else who could play, and now we've got a record out on 4AD. I sometimes find it impossible to come to terms with what's happening.\" Anderson and Berenyi were the only women to take part in the 1992 Lollapalooza tour of the United States.\n\nBoth Anderson and Berenyi became major music press celebrities as part of The Scene That Celebrates Itself. Music magazines the \"NME\" and \"Melody Maker\" gleefully reported their social activities on a regular basis, which could be said to overshadow their increasingly strong songwriting. As drummer Chris Acland states, \"people seem to want to talk about Lush's relationship to the press more than they want to talk about Lush.\"\n\nOf the sound of Lush, Emma says, \"\"We were kind of punk rock in one way. We did think 'Well, if they can do it, why the fuck can't we?' Basically, our idea was to have extremely loud guitars with much weaker vocals. And, really the vocals were weaker due to nervousness – we'd always be going 'Turn them down! Turn them down!'.\"\"\n\nAfter their biggest hits, the Top 30 \"Single Girl\", \"Ladykillers\" and \"500 (Shake Baby Shake)\" and Top 10 album, \"Lovelife\", the band's drummer Chris Acland took his own life in 1996. The members were devastated and they split in 1996. Lush officially announced their breakup on 23 February 1998.\n\nWhile a member of Lush, Anderson also worked with Drum Club contributing vocals and guitar on \"Spaced Out Locked In\" on their 1993 album \"Everything Is Now\", also playing guitar on \"Sound System\".\n\nIn 1997 Anderson formed a new band with vocalist Lisa O'Neill, Sing-Sing. Emma talks about how it started, \"I just started writing songs not really knowing what was going to happen though I kind of knew I didn't want to form another 4-piece indie band. I demoed those songs for 4AD with myself singing but was dropped but I wasn't fazed. I then met Lisa O'Neill via a guy I was going out with at the time. She had worked with Mark Van Hoen whom funnily enough, someone I knew said, was looking for collaborators so it kind of all fell into place and Sing-Sing was born.\"\nThey released two albums – \"The Joy of Sing-Sing\" in 2001 and \"Sing-Sing and I\" in 2005, before officially disbanding on New Year's Day 2008.\n\nAnderson joined in reforming Lush in 2015, releasing a four-track EP \"Blind Spot\" in early 2016.\n\nAnderson currently resides in Hastings.\n\n\n\n"}

She is known for her role as Sally Solomon in the television series \"3rd Rock from the Sun\", for which she twice won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She also starred as Wilma Flintstone in \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" and as Holly Franklin in the sitcom \"The Exes\". Since 2018, she stars as recovering addict Tammy Diffendorf in the CBS sitcom \"Mom\".\n\nJohnston was born in Washington, D.C., but was raised mostly in Fox Point, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee, where she attended St. Eugene's Catholic Grade School and Whitefish Bay High School. She spent some of her teen years in Sweden and in South America and earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in drama at New York University.\n\nJohnston made her professional stage debut with New York's Atlantic Theater Company, which was founded by playwright David Mamet. During her association with that company, she appeared in such productions as \"As You Like It\" and \"Stage Door\", among many others. She has performed with the Naked Angels Theater Company in \"The Stand-In\" and \"Hot Keys\", and with New York Stage and Film in \"Kim's Sister\", with David Strathairn and Jane Adams. For her performance in \"The Lights\" at Lincoln Center Theater, Johnston was nominated for a Drama Desk Award as Best Supporting Actress.\n\nThe show brought her to the attention of a Carsey-Werner television executive. After numerous auditions in 1996 for the TV series \"3rd Rock from the Sun\", she won the role of Sally Solomon. She starred in the series from 1996 to 2001. The role earned her two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nShe made her feature film debut in \"The Debt\", winner of Best Short at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. In 1995, she played Kate in the film \"Backfire!\" She played Esmeralda, a sea hag in \"Thrill Ride\", a family friendly film released in 2016. Other television credits include guest-starring roles on the series \"Chicago Hope\", \"Hearts Afire\", and \"The 5 Mrs. Buchanans\". She was also the narrator in \"Microscopic Milton\" on the Disney Channel. Her significant roles in commercially successful movies included \"\" in 1999, \"Ice Age\", and \"Music and Lyrics\" in 2007.

In the case of a so-called technical architecture, the architecture must be communicated to software developers; a functional architecture is communicated to various stakeholders and users. Some ADLs that have been developed are: Acme (developed by CMU), AADL (standardized by the SAE), C2 (developed by UCI), SBC-ADL (developed by National Sun Yat-Sen University), Darwin (developed by Imperial College London), and Wright (developed by CMU).\n\nThe ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 document, \"Systems and software engineering—Architecture description\", defines an architecture description language as \"any form of expression for use in architecture descriptions\" and specifies minimum requirements on ADLs.\n\nThe enterprise modelling and engineering community have also developed architecture description languages catered for at the enterprise level. Examples include ArchiMate (now a standard of The Open Group), DEMO, ABACUS (developed by the University of Technology, Sydney). These languages do not necessarily refer to software components, etc. Most of them, however, refer to an application architecture as the architecture that is communicated to the software engineers.\n\nMost of the writing below refers primarily to the perspective from the software engineering community.\n\nA standard notation (ADL) for representing architectures helps promote mutual communication, the embodiment of early design decisions, and the creation of a transferable abstraction of a system. Architectures in the past were largely represented by box-and-line drawing annotated with such things as the nature of the component, properties, semantics of connections, and overall system behavior. ADLs result from a linguistic approach to the formal representation of architectures, and as such they address its shortcomings. Also important, sophisticated ADLs allow for early analysis and feasibility testing of architectural design decisions.\n\nADLs have been classified into three broad categories: box-and-line informal drawings, formal architecture description language, and UML (Unified Modeling Language)-based notations.\n\nBox-and-line have been for a long time the most predominant means for describing SAs. While providing useful documentation, the level of\ninformality limited the usefulness of the architecture description. A more rigorous way for describing SAs was required. Quoting Allen and Garlan (1997), \"while these [box-and-line] descriptions may provide useful documentation, the current level of informality limits their usefulness. Since it is generally imprecise what is meant by such architectural descriptions, it may be impossible to analyze an architecture for consistency or determine non-trivial properties of it. Moreover, there is no way to check that a system implementation is faithful to its architectural design.\" A similar conclusion is drawn in Perry and Wolf (1992), which reports that: \"Aside from providing clear and precise documentation, the primary purpose of specifications is to provide automated analysis of the documents and to expose various kinds of problems that would otherwise go undetected.\"\n\nSince then, a thread of research on formal languages for SA description has been carried out. Tens of formal ADLs have been proposed, each characterized by different conceptual architectural elements, different syntax or semantics, focusing on a specific operational domain, or only suitable for different analysis techniques. For example, domain-specific ADLs have been presented to deal with embedded and real-time systems (such as AADL, EAST-ADL, and EADL), control-loop applications (DiaSpec), product line architectures (Koala), and dynamic systems (Π-ADL)). Analysis-specific ADLs have been proposed to deal with availability, reliability, security, resource consumption, data quality and real-time performance analysis (AADL, behavioral analysis (Fractal)), and trustworthiness analysis (TADL).\n\nHowever, these efforts have not seen the desired adoption by industrial practice. Some reasons for this lack of industry adoption have been analyzed by Woods and Hilliard, Pandey, Clements, and others: formal ADLs have been rarely integrated in the software life-cycle, they are seldom supported by mature tools, scarcely documented, focusing on very specific needs, and leaving no space for extensions enabling the addition of new features.\n\nAs a way to overcome some of those limitations, UML has been indicated as a possible successor of existing ADLs. Many proposals have been presented to use or extend the UML to more properly model software architectures.\n\nIn fact, as highlighted in a recent study conducted with practitioners, whilst practitioners are generally satisfied with the design capabilities provided by the languages they use, they are dissatisfied with the architectural language analysis features and their abilities to define extra-functional properties; architectural languages used in practice mostly originate from industrial development instead of from academic research; more formality and better usability are required of an architectural language.\n\nThere is a large variety in ADLs developed by either academic or industrial groups. Many languages were not intended to be an ADL, but they turn out to be suitable for representing and analyzing an architecture.\nIn principle ADLs differ from requirements languages, because ADLs are rooted in the solution space, whereas requirements describe problem spaces. They differ from programming languages, because ADLs do not bind architectural abstractions to specific point solutions. Modeling languages represent behaviors, where ADLs focus on representation of components. However, there are domain specific modeling languages (DSMLs) that focus on representation of components.\n\nMinimal requirements\n\n\"The language must:\"\nADLs have in common:\n\nADLs differ in their ability to:\n\n\n\nThe ADL community generally agrees that Software Architecture is a set of components and the connections among them. But there are different kind of architectures like:\n\n\n\nMost ADLs implement an interface connection architecture.\n\nArchitecture, in the context of software systems, is roughly divided into categories, primarily software architecture, network architecture, and systems architecture. Within each of these categories, there is a tangible but fuzzy distinction between architecture and design. To draw this distinction as universally and clearly as possible, it is best to consider design as a noun rather than as a verb, so that the comparison is between two nouns.\n\nDesign is the abstraction and specification of patterns and organs of functionality that have been or will be implemented. Architecture is a degree higher in both abstraction and granularity. Consequentially, architecture is also more topological in nature than design, in that it specifies where major components meet and how they relate to one another. Architecture focuses on the partitioning of major regions of functionality into high level components, where they will physically or virtually reside, what off-the-shelf components may be employed effectively, in general what interfaces each component will expose, what protocols will be employed between them, and what practices and high level patterns may best meet extensibility, maintainability, reliability, durability, scalability, and other non-functional objectives. Design is a detailing of these choices and a more concrete clarification of how functional requirements will be met through the delegation of pieces of that functionality to more granular components and how these smaller components will be organized within the larger ones.\n\nOftentimes, a portion of architecture is done during the conceptualization of an application, system, or network and may appear in the non-functional sections of requirement documentation. Canonically, design is not specified in requirements, but is rather driven by them.\n\nThe process of defining an architecture may involve heuristics, acquired by the architect or architectural team through experience within the domain. As with design, architecture often evolves through a series of iterations, and just as the wisdom of a high level design is often tested when low level design and implementation occurs, the wisdom of an architecture is tested during the specification of a high level design. In both cases, if the wisdom of the specification is called into question during detailing, another iteration of either architecture or design, as the case may be, may become necessary.\n\nIn summary, the primary differences between architecture and design are ones of granularity and abstraction, and (consequentially) chronology. (Architecture generally precedes design, although overlap and circular iteration is a common reality.)\n\nBelow the list gives the candidates for being the best ADL to date.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of currently existing architectural languages, please refer Up-to-date list of ADLs.\n\n\nApproaches to architecture\n\n\n"}

The term was coined by \"Melody Maker's\" Steve Sutherland in 1990 in a near-contemptuous gesture, focusing on how bands involved in the scene, rather than engaging in traditional rivalries, were often seen at each other's gigs, sometimes playing in each other's bands, and drinking together. \nBands lumped into the 'scene' by the press included several of the bands that were branded with the shoegazing label, such as Chapterhouse, Lush, Moose and other (mainly indie) bands such as Blur (prior to the release of their single \"Popscene\"), Thousand Yard Stare, See See Rider and Stereolab. A prime example were Moose, who often swapped members with other bands on a given night. Moose's Russell Yates and Stereolab guitarist Tim Gane would often trade places, while \"Moose\" McKillop often played with See See Rider. Gane and his Stereolab colleague Lætitia Sadier even played on the 1991 session by Moose for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show.\n\nThe bands, producers and journalists of the time would gather in London and their activities would be chronicled in the gossip pages of the music papers \"NME\" and \"Melody Maker\". The most famous club and focal point was Syndrome, which was located on Oxford Street and ran weekly on Thursday nights.

It is frequently referred to as \"Oakland Chinatown\" in order to distinguish it from nearby San Francisco's Chinatown. It lies at an elevation of 39 feet (12 m).\n\nChinese were the first Asians to arrive in Oakland in the 1850s, followed by Japanese in the 1890s, Koreans in the 1900s, and Filipinos in the 1930s and 1940s. Southeast Asians began arriving in the 1970s during the Vietnam War. Many Asian languages and dialects can be heard in Chinatown due to its diverse population.\n\nChinatown is located in downtown Oakland, with its center at 8th Street and Webster Street. Its northern edge is 12th Street, and its southern edge is Interstate 880 (located approximately at 6th Street). It stretches from Broadway on the west to the southern tip of Lake Merritt in the east.\n\nOakland Chinatown dates back to the arrival of Chinese immigrants in the 1850s, making it one of the oldest Chinatowns in North America. By 1860, the census of Oakland included 96 \"Asiatics\" among a total of 1,543 (6.2% of the city's population). More Chinese arrived to help build the Central Pacific Railroad western portion of the First Transcontinental Railroad during the Coolie slave trade during the 1860s.\n\nThe Chinese settled in shrimp camps on the estuary of Oakland at 1st Street and Castro in the 1850s, near the Point in West Oakland which was referred to as \"Chinese Point\", and at 4th and Clay streets. The Chinese settlement at Telegraph between 16th and 17th streets burnt down in 1867 and was relocated at the San Pablo Avenue Chinatown between 19th and 20th streets; it is now known as Oakland's Old Uptown Chinatown. Other areas settled were 14th Street between Washington and Clay, and the Charter line (22nd Street) between Castro and Brush Streets.\n\nFears of the Yellow Peril and local exclusion laws forced the Chinese population to resettle to its current location centered at 8th Street and Webster Street in the 1870s.\n\nThe first Chinese in Oakland fished in the San Francisco Bay for shrimp similarly to the Chinese at China Camp near San Rafael. In 1868, Chinese laborers built the Temescal Dam in Oakland providing water for the East Bay as well as the Lake Chabot Dam in 1874–75. They worked in canneries, cotton mills and fuse and explosive factories as well as farms. In the 1880s, discriminatory laws made it difficult for Chinese immigrants to own land or even find work. They found work as laundry workers, cooks, gardeners, houseboys, or as vegetable peddlers. The Chinese Exclusion Act severely limited the further immigration of Chinese. By 1900, the Chinese in Oakland numbered less than 1,000.\n\nThe 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire destroyed most of San Francisco's Chinatown and more than 4,000 Chinese survivors found refuge in Oakland. Even while San Francisco Chinatown was rebuilding, many stayed in Oakland, bringing the Chinatown population to about 2,500. Because of immigration restrictions barring Chinese women and children, a bachelor society was created.\n\nIn the 1920s, Oakland Chinatown grew from 10th Street to the waterfront from Broadway to Harrison.\n\nEven until 1940, the Chinatown population grew only to about 3,000. With the United States involvement in World War II and the fact that China was an ally, the Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed in 1943, however the immigration quota was maintained at 105 immigrants per year.\n\nIn 1950, Chinatown grew to a population of 5,500, but local housing was lost due to the construction of Interstate 880, which runs through 8 blocks between 5th and 6th streets and serves as a transportation artery for some of Chinatown's commercial activity, Laney College (8 blocks) and later in the late 1960s, the Bay Area Rapid Transit headquarters and Lake Merritt station (2 blocks) and Oakland Museum of California (4 blocks).\n\nOakland Chinatown was economically stagnant for many years, especially after multigenerational Chinatown residents began moving to the suburbs in the late 1960s. However, Chinatown saw much steady development during the 1980s and 1990s as Chinese American merchants relocated from San Francisco to Oakland, and due to increased immigration from mainland China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. During this time period, many ethnic Chinese Vietnamese and Chinese Cambodians began opening new small businesses, essentially replacing many of the older Taishanese-dominated businesses. Also, investors with Hong Kong backgrounds constructed the Pacific Renaissance Plaza in the early 1990s. Chinatown still retains the traditional aspects and characteristics of an older Chinatown. Oakland's Chinatown also includes a historic and still thriving fortune cookie factory.\n\nAlthough it is overshadowed by its more prominent, tourist-oriented counterpart in San Francisco, Oakland's Chinatown is bustling with activity and considered to be more authentic to many. Other Asian cultures are represented in Oakland's Chinatown as it has also been settled by non-Chinese Asians such as ethnic Vietnamese (many of whom operate many of Chinatown's jewelry businesses), Koreans, and Thais making it more of a pan-Asian area as opposed to a \"Chinatown.\" As is the case with other retail and commercial districts around Oakland, the many customers and thriving businesses in Chinatown generate sales tax revenue for Oakland city and Redevelopment Agency coffers.\n\nJapanese immigrants began settling in Oakland in the 1890s mostly in West Oakland around Market Street. Later, hundreds were living in the section between Harrison and Oak streets south of 8th Street. They owned several stores in Chinatown. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, all Japanese Americans were sent to internment camps. The Masuda family had posted a large \"I Am An American\" sign outside their Oakland grocery store, Wanto Company, at 8th and Franklin streets which was photographed by Dorothea Lange. Many did not return to Oakland after the war ended. The Buddhist Church of Oakland is one of the few institutions remaining of Oakland's Japantown.\n\nFilipinos immigrated to the area in the early 1900s. Oakland Chinatown was the center of commerce and community gathering for Filipinos in the East Bay during 1940–1960.\n\nThe residents of Oakland Chinatown include Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Filipino, Japanese, Cambodian, Laotian, Mien, Thai, Samoan and others. Consequently, many languages and dialects can be heard, including Cantonese, Chiu-Chow, Ilocano, Japanese, Khmer, Khmu, Korean, Lao, Malay, Mandarin, Mien, Tagalog, Taiwanese, Thai, Toishan, and Vietnamese.\n\n\nThe \"Chinese Community United Methodist Church\" (CCUMC), which was initially the \"Chinese Methodist Church\" was founded in 1887. The church was established as part of a chain of Methodist Chinese Missions by the Rev. Dr. Otis Gibson. The two primary missions of this ministry was schools and refuge for women escaping slavery and prostitution. This church has close connections with the Women's Missionary Society of the Pacific Coast in San Francisco. In the early days, the Chinese Methodist Church held worship service and Sunday School. Then to serve the needs of the growing Chinese community, an English school for immigrants, and a Chinese school for the American-born Chinese also operated. The early days of the church was sustained by courageous workers, both Chinese- and American-born as there were strong anti-Chinese sentiments in California at this time.\n\nThe church was located at several sites in Oakland Chinatown. Chan Hon Fun was the pastor from 1900 to 1909 and established the church's current location in 1905 at 321 8th Street Oakland, CA 94607. In 1913, a fire devastated the building and a new building was erected. But by the 1940s, the church outgrew even this building. Under the leadership of Rev Edwar Lee, a new church and the current main sanctuary was built in 1952. With more growth, more space was needed, and a new social hall and classrooms annex was built in 1970.\n\nToday, the Chinese Community United Methodist Church conducts both a Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin) language worship service and English worship service on Sundays.\n\n\nChinese opera was one of the first traditional Chinese art forms in Oakland. In 1907, a Chinese Theater at 9th and Franklin streets opened which could seat 500 people and had a company of 30 full-time actors from China. Today, three styles of Chinese opera clubs are active in Oakland: Cantonese opera, Beijing opera, and Kunqu.\n\nA plaza built by Hong Kong investors in the 1990s, this plaza is often viewed as the center of Oakland Chinatown, it consists of many restaurants, a library, jewelry store, bank, ice creamery, and other health services.\n\nThe Asian Branch Library is one of many of Oakland Public Library's branches and is located in Chinatown's \"Pacific Renaissance Plaza.\" The Asian Library is unique among public library branches in the United States as it houses eight Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Cambodian, Tagalog and Laotian) in major reference titles and general subject titles, an Asian Studies collection, in addition to an English-language Asian American collection.\n\nThe Asian Branch Library was founded in 1975 as part of a Federal Library Services Construction Act grant to create a model library serving the Asian community in Oakland with multilingual staff and collections. In 1978, the branch moved from its original location at the Park Boulevard to the Main Library. In 1981, it moved to its own building at 9th Street and Broadway. The current location in the Pacific Renaissance Plaza opened to the public in 1995.\n\n\nChinatown is located in Downtown between Broadway to the west, Interstate 880 to the south, Oak Street and Laney College to the east, and 12th Street to the north. The entrance to the Webster Tube, which carries traffic underneath the estuary, is on the edge of Chinatown. Unlike many Chinatowns, it has no formal arch (Paifang) or gate, but it does have bilingual street signs.\n\nThe neighborhood can be roughly divided into two distinct areas: Between Broadway and Harrison Street is the commercial area, with busy streets lined with markets, restaurants, banks, and other businesses. East of Harrison Street, the neighborhood is more residential in character with more apartments and condominiums, less crowded sidewalks, and a mix of retail stores that are more service and product oriented, with fewer groceries and restaurants. Though the mainstay of commercial activity is south of 10th Street, there are nonetheless many retail shops, stores, and restaurants north of 10th Street and in other parts of Downtown Oakland which are owned by Chinese and Korean merchants. In particular at the edge of Chinatown, 14th street between Webster and Harrison is block which features numerous Korean restaurants and businesses, especially on the north side of the block.\n\nRecent immigrants have also moved south into \"New Oakland Chinatown\" in the San Antonio neighborhood along International Boulevard (formerly East 14th Street) and Eastlake business district on East 18th Street.\n\n\nThe Oakland Police Department's Administration Building is located at 455 Seventh St.\n\nChinatown is in Oakland Police Department's Beat 3X. The Community Services Section hosts the Asian Advisory Committee on Crime and the Asian Youth Services Committee.\n\nThe Chinatown Neighborhood Crime Prevention Council for beat 3x, a neighborhood community-policing board meets monthly. Meetings are conducted in Cantonese and are open to all.\n\nOakland Fire Department, Fire Station No. 12 is located at 822 Alice Street at 9th Street. Fire Engine 12 is assigned to this fire station. The citizens of Oakland and the Oakland Fire Department will remember the service and sacrifice of Oakland Engine Company No. 12. Hoseman Tracy Toomey who died in the line of duty on January 10, 1999 in a 2-story building collapse after responding to a 6-alarm fire on upper Broadway.\n\nLocated at the crossroads of the 880 freeway, the tubes linking Alameda and Oakland, and downtown, Oakland Chinatown bears a significant transportation burden that dates back to the 1950s. Weekday and everyday commerce in the area creates thousands of peak period private automobile trips daily and resulting air pollution impacts on the neighborhood's elderly residents. Over 20,000 shoppers and tourists use its sidewalks every weekend. The traffic on I-880 is over 100,000 cars per day. The neighborhood is served by a freeway on-ramp to I-880 south at 5th and Oak Street. It is also served by a freeway on-ramp to I-980 at 6th and Jackson. Recently Oakland's Public Works Agency reconfigured travel lanes on Jackson Street to separate traffic travelling South on Jackson from traffic merging-into Jackson from Eastbound 7th Street. This effectively eliminated, through lane re-marking, any possibility of the lost art of the \"alternating merge.\" The volume of automobile traffic travelling away from the core of Chinatown on 7th street towards the freeway connections was so voluminous and unrelenting, that accidents were occurring.\n\nChinatown has the highest number of automobile-pedestrian collisions in the City of Oakland. A pedestrian safety campaign brought in the first scramble system in Alameda County to Oakland Chinatown to prevent further pedestrian fatalities and injuries.\n\nUntil recently, California Auto Insurance company actuarial models charged higher rates to residents in the Chinatown's zip code under a practice known as territorial rating, or zip code profiling. The insurance actuarial theory behind this market practice purports that drivers residing or \"principally garaging\" their cars in a certain area face a greater loss and accident ratio. This practice was outlawed by California voters in 1988 by Proposition 103 on the statewide ballot. The law made its way through the courts for 18 years before several insurance companies settled with California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi in 2006 to put an end to the practice.\n\nOakland is served by several AC Transit bus lines which run on 7th, 8th, 11th, 12th, Broadway, and Franklin Streets. Many visitors to the neighborhood use nearby mass transit connections. The neighborhood has two BART stations: 12th Street Station on its northwest corner, and Lake Merritt Station at its eastern edge.\n\nResidents of Chinatown are zoned to schools in the Oakland Unified School District.\nZoned schools include :\n\nAmerican Indian Public Charter School II, a charter school campus of the American Indian Model Schools system, is located in Chinatown. It caters to students living in the Chinatown and Lake Merritt areas. In 2008 it shared a campus with Oakland Charter Academies (now Amethod Public Schools).\n\nThe Lighthouse Community Charter School was established in Oakland's Chinatown in the 2004 – 2005 school year with grades K-2 and 6–8 and later expanded to serve grades K – 12. In the 2009–2010 school year, the school relocated to a facility close to the Oakland airport.\n\nYu Ming Charter School, a Mandarin immersion charter school, currently serves grades K through 4. It will eventually grow to K through 8 by adding a grade every year. Formerly located at 321 10th Street, the school moved to 1086 Alcatraz Avenue in February 2013.\n\n\n\nA source of healthcare for the surrounding community include Asian Health Services. Since 1974, they have provided the densely populated Asian community with health services including mental health, dental care, advocacy and opportunities to participate in community leadership. \"To serve and advocate for the medically underserved, including the immigrant and refugee Asian community...\", is an integral part of their mission statement\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His translations had an influential impact on the development of Esperanto into a language of literature.\n\nGrabowski was born in Nowe Dobra, a village 10 km northeast of Chełmno. Soon after his birth, the family moved from Nowe Dobra to Thorn, Prussia (now Toruń, Poland). Due to his parents' poverty, Grabowski had to start working soon after leaving elementary school. Nevertheless, he prepared himself, driven by a great desire to learn, to take the entrance exam for grammar school (Gymnasium), which he passed with flying colours. At the Copernicus School in Thorn, after demonstrating a knowledge far exceeding others of his age, he twice skipped a grade. In 1879, the family's financial situation improved and, after his Abitur exam, Grabowski studied philosophy and natural science at the University of Breslau in Breslau (now Wrocław).\n\nAfter graduation he worked as a practical chemical engineer in Zawiercie and in locations which now are part of the Czech Republic, and finally as manager of a textile factory in Ivanovo-Voznesensk, 250 km north-east of Moscow.\n\nMeanwhile, he continued his in-depth studies into chemical problems. He was known among experts in the field throughout Europe for a multitude of inventions and technological innovations. Grabowski published many articles, including some describing his inventions, in the journals \"Chemik Polski\" (\"Polish Chemist\") and \"Przegląd Techniczny\" (\"Technical Survey\"). During this time he translated a standard chemistry textbook by Ira Remsen from English to Polish. Later Grabowski was appointed to a commission tasked with drawing up Polish technical terminology. A few years later (1906) he published his \"Słownik chemiczny\", the first Polish chemical dictionary.\n\nEven at the university, Grabowski had developed a far-reaching literary interest, joining the Slavic Literary Society (\"Towarzystwo Literacko-Słowianskie\"). His endeavour was in no way limited to Polish language and literature; gradually he learnt a considerable number of languages and became a true polyglot. Apart from his mother tongue, he was eventually able to speak nine additional languages and passively to use at least another 15. With his linguistic background, Grabowski also became interested in the idea of an international language. Having learned Volapük, he decided to visit Johann Schleyer, the author of this language project. Seeing that even Schleyer himself was unable to speak Volapük fluently and that Grabowski and Schleyer had been forced to converse in German instead, Grabowski formed the conclusion that Volapük was unsuitable for everyday use. After this disappointment, Grabowski gave up his work on Volapük but maintained an active interest in the idea of an international planned language.\nIn 1887 he studied the booklet \"Dr. Esperanto's International Language: Introduction & Complete Grammar\", published in the same year by Ludwik L. Zamenhof, which outlined Zamenhof's ambitious language project— soon to become known by the name \"Esperanto\". Impressed by the transparent structure of Esperanto and by its capacity for expression which, he thought, could be picked up astonishingly quickly, Grabowski traveled to Warsaw to visit Zamenhof, where the two held the first oral conversation in Esperanto.\n\nLike Zamenhof, Grabowski understood the important influence of literature on the development of languages, and especially for Esperanto, which by then was on the way to changing from a language project into a language which would be fully functional in all areas of life. Grabowski was already working on this: in 1888 he published \"La Neĝa Blovado,\" his translation of Pushkin's Russian short story \"Метель\", known in English variously as \"The Blizzard\" and as \"The Snowstorm\"; followed in 1889 by \"La Gefratoj,\" his translation of Goethe's German one-act play \"Die Geschwister\" (1776), known in English both as \"Brother and Sister\" and as \"The Siblings\" — to name just his first two Esperanto publications.\n\nDuring the early 1890s, Grabowski became unsatisfied by the slow spread of Esperanto. Believing that \"imperfections\" in the language were responsible for the slow pace, he pleaded for reform. In a vote among Esperantists that took place in 1894, however, he voted against changes to the language. For a number of years he worked on a planned language of his own he called \"Modern Latin\", advising his friend Edgar de Wahl during the early creation of his language Occidental to give up the search to find regularity in naturalistic auxiliary languages and join him on his purely naturalistic project instead. Not long after, however, he gave up on the idea and adhered to the basic principles of Esperanto as originally espoused by Zamenhof, the so-called \"Fundamento de Esperanto\".\n\nGrabowski was a longstanding president of the Warsaw Esperanto Society, founded in 1904, and of the Polish Esperanto Society, founded in 1908. In the same year he became director of the Grammar section of the Esperanto Academy. He published articles and gave lectures on Esperanto and organized Esperanto language courses.\n\nIn the years 1908–1914 Grabowski was in charge of the first Esperanto courses for a few schools in Warsaw. In an article in 1908 he described what he saw as the exceptional suitability of Esperanto as an introduction to language learning (see Propedeutic value of Esperanto), demonstrating with concrete examples the extent to which learning Esperanto as one's first foreign language would improve the learning of French and Latin, a claim which seemed inconceivable to the public of that time.\n\nThe anthology \"El Parnaso de Popoloj\" (\"From The Parnassus Of The Peoples\"), published in 1913, contained 116 poems representing 30 languages and cultures. Six of the poems were originally composed in Esperanto. The remaining 110 were translated into Esperanto from other languages.\n\nWorld War I separated Grabowski from his family, who had fled to Russia. Ill and isolated, he remained behind in Warsaw, where he busied himself in translating the Polish national epic \"Pan Tadeusz\" by Adam Mickiewicz. While working on his translation, which was precisely faithful to the original form, he put the latent potential of the planned language to the test, thereby giving significant impetus to the further development of Esperanto poetry.\n\nSuffering from a chronic heart condition but unable to afford the necessary medical treatment, he lived at that time in oppressive poverty, and when his family returned after the end of the war, his body had become almost emaciated. Nevertheless, he continued his work on Esperanto until his death in Warsaw, from a heart attack, in 1921.\n\n\"This article is based on an of the Esperanto Wikipedia and was translated via the corresponding version.\"\n"}

{"id": "1799354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799354", "title": "Vilgot Sjöman", "text": "Vilgot Sjöman\n\nDavid Harald Vilgot Sjöman (2 December 1924 – 9 April 2006) was a Swedish writer and film director. His films deal with controversial issues of social class, morality, and sexual taboos, combining the emotionally tortured characters of Ingmar Bergman with the avant garde style of the French New Wave. He is best known as the director of the films \"491\" (1964), \"I Am Curious (Yellow)\" (in Swedish, \"Jag är nyfiken – gul\") (1967), and \"I Am Curious (Blue)\" (\"Jag är nyfiken – blå\") (1968), which stretched the boundaries of acceptability of what could then be shown on film, deliberately treating their subjects in a provocative and explicit manner.\n\nSjöman was born in Stockholm, from a working-class family. His father, Anders W. Sjöman, was a builder; his mother was Mandis Pettersson. Sjöman became a clerk with a cereal company aged 15, but passed his \"studentexamen\" in 1945 and studied at the later Stockholm University. He then worked in a prison while writing plays (none of which were produced). One play became his first novel, \"The Teacher\" (\"Lektorn\") (1955), which was filmed in 1952 by Gustaf Molander as \"Defiance\" (\"Trots\").\n\nAfter taking up a scholarship to study film at UCLA in 1956, Sjöman worked with George Seaton on \"The Proud and Profane\". He returned to Sweden, and wrote a study of Hollywood, \"In Hollywood\" (\"I Hollywood\") in 1961. Sjöman directed his first film in 1962, \"The Mistress\" (\"Älskarinnan\"), with a cast that included regular actors for Ingmar Bergman such as Bibi Andersson and Max von Sydow, showing a young woman in love with two men, one older and the other younger. For her role, Anderson won the Silver Bear for Best Actress award at the 13th Berlin International Film Festival. He assisted Ingmar Bergman with his 1963 film, \"Winter Light\" (\"Nattvardsgästerna\").\n\nSjöman's second film, \"491\", from 1964, is based on a novel by Lars Görling and deals with the issues of homosexuality and juvenile delinquency; it includes a scene in which a girl is raped, off-screen, by a dog. His fourth film, \"My Sister My Love\" (\"Syskonbädd 1782\"), from 1966, again starred Bibi Andersson and is based on \"Tis Pity She's a Whore\", a 17th-century play by John Ford about incest between a brother and his twin sister.\n\nHis most well-known film, \"I Am Curious (Yellow)\", was a political film that examined Swedish society from a critical, leftist viewpoint, portraying a young working-class sociology student, played by Lena Nyman, interviewing people about social classes in Sweden. Filmed in a knowing cinéma vérité style, she asks, \"Do we have a class system in Sweden?\" and receives the reply, \"It depends on the people. Undress them, and they're all the same; dress them, and you have a class system.\" The film also shows the protagonist's affair with a young man, played by Börje Ahlstedt, and sparked controversy both in Sweden and abroad because of its nudity and realistic scenes of sexual intercourse between the two lovers. Norman Mailer described it as \"one of the most important pictures I have ever seen in my life\".\n\nAn 11-minute section was cut by the British censor, and copies of the film were seized by U.S. Customs in January 1968 as obscene, and banned as pornography in most of the United States. After the US Supreme Court overturned the anti-obscenity ban on First Amendment grounds, the film was screened from March 1969 in US venues—one in New York City, and another one in New Jersey. Also screen in Oklahoma City Oklahoma March 1969. However, the controversy surrounding the film guaranteed it large audiences, and it became and remained the most successful foreign film in the US for the next 23 years. Its title, and that of the 1968 sequel, \"I Am Curious (Blue)\", refers to the yellow and blue colours of the flag of Sweden. It marked a turning point in attitudes to censorship of screen nudity, and was followed by films such as \"Midnight Cowboy\" and \"Last Tango in Paris\".\n\nSjöman returned to similar themes in later films. He directed \"Till Sex Do Us Part\" in 1971, a farce about a young married couple who believe they will die if they have sex, but most of his later films were less successful. His 1974 film \"A Handful of Love\" won the awards for Best Film and Best Director at the 10th Guldbagge Awards.\n\nHe directed his last film in 1995, a biography of Alfred Nobel, inventor, industrialist, and founder of the Nobel Prizes, entitled \"Alfred\".\n\nHe died at age 81 from a cerebral haemorrhage in St. Görans Sjukhus in Stockholm, leaving behind his wife of 37 years and three children.\n\nShortly after his death, a Swedish appeal court upheld a ruling that Swedish television broadcaster TV4 had damaged his and fellow director Claes Eriksson's \"artistic integrity\" by inserting commercial breaks into broadcasts of their films without their consent.

{"id": "1799367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799367", "title": "LGBT rights in Germany", "text": "LGBT rights in Germany\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights in Germany have evolved significantly over the course of the last decades. During the 1920s and early 1930s, lesbian and gay people in Berlin were generally tolerated by society and many bars and clubs specifically pertaining to gay men were opened. Although same-sex sexual activity between men was already made illegal under Paragraph 175 by the German Empire in 1871, Nazi Germany extended these laws during World War II, which resulted in the persecution and deaths of thousands of homosexual citizens. The Nazi extensions were repealed in 1950 and same-sex sexual activity between men was decriminalised in both East and West Germany in 1968 and 1969, respectively. The age of consent was equalized in unified Germany in 1994.\n\nSame-sex marriage has been legal since 1 October 2017, after the Bundestag passed legislation giving same-sex couples full marital and adoption rights on 30 June 2017. Prior to that, registered partnerships were available to same-sex couples, having been legalised in 2001. These partnerships provided most though not all of the same rights as marriages, and they ceased to be available after the introduction of same-sex marriage. Same-sex stepchild adoption first became legal in 2005 and was expanded in 2013 to allow someone in a same-sex relationship to adopt a child already adopted by their partner. Discrimination protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity vary across Germany, but discrimination in employment and the provision of goods and services is banned countrywide. Transgender people have been allowed to change their legal gender since 1980. The law initially required them to undergo surgical alteration of their genitals in order to have key identity documents changed. This has since been declared unconstitutional.\n\nDespite two of the three main political parties in the German Government being socially conservative on the issues of LGBT rights, Germany has frequently been seen as one of the most gay-friendly countries in the world. Recent polls have indicated that a large majority of Germans support same-sex marriage. Another poll in 2013 indicated that 87% of Germans believed that homosexuality should be accepted by society, which was the second highest score in the world (only 39 countries were polled) following Spain (88%). Berlin has been referred to by publications as one of the most gay friendly cities in the world. The former Mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, is one of the most famous openly gay men in Germany, next to the former Mayor of Hamburg, Ole von Beust, the Federal Minister of Health, Jens Spahn, the deceased former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Guido Westerwelle, the former Federal Ministry of the Environment, Barbara Hendricks, comedians Hape Kerkeling, and Hella von Sinnen, or political journalist Anne Will. Founded in 1981, the Akademie Waldschlösschen, an adult education conference center near Göttingen, has developed into a national networking hub for LGBTI teachers, lawyers, clergy, gay fathers and gay and lesbian student groups at German universities, many in cooperation with TransAktiv and Intersexuelle Menschen e.V.. Germany's most famous gay rights activist is Rosa von Praunheim. His film \"It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives\" (1971) triggered the modern gay liberation movement in Germany.\n\nHomosexuality was punishable by death in the Holy Roman Empire from 1532 until its dissolution and in Prussia from 1620 to 1794. The influence of the Napoleonic Code in the early 1800s sparked decriminalisations in much of Germany outside of Prussia. However, in 1871, the year the federal German Empire was formed, Paragraph 175 of the new Penal Code recriminalised homosexual acts. The law was extended under Nazi rule, and convictions multiplied by a factor of ten to about 8,000 per year. Penalties were severe, and 5,000–15,000 suspected offenders were interned in concentration camps, where most of them died.\n\nThe Nazi additions were repealed in East Germany in 1950, but homosexual relations between men remained a crime until 1968. West Germany kept the more repressive version of the law, legalising male homosexual activity one year after East Germany, in 1969. The age of consent was equalized in East Germany through a 1987 court ruling, with West Germany following suit in 1989; it is now 14 years (16/18 in some circumstances) for female-female, male-male and female-male activity.\n\nEast Germany inherited Paragraph 175. Communist gay activist Rudolf Klimmer, modelling himself on Magnus Hirschfeld and his Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, campaigned in 1954 to have the law repealed, but was unsuccessful. His work prevented any further convictions for homosexuality after 1957.\n\nIn the five years following the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany, the GDR Government instituted a program of \"moral reform\" to build a solid foundation for the new socialist republic, in which masculinity and the traditional family were championed, while homosexuality, seen to contravene \"healthy mores of the working people\", continued to be prosecuted under Paragraph 175. Same sex activity was \"alternatively viewed as a remnant of bourgeois decadence, a sign of moral weakness, and a threat to the social and political health of the nation\".\n\nIn East Germany, Paragraph 175 ceased to be enforced from 1957 but remained on the books until 1968. Officially, homosexuality was decriminalised in East Germany in 1968.\n\nAccording to historian Heidi Minning, attempts by lesbians and gay activists in East Germany to establish a visible community were \"thwarted at every turn by the GDR Government and the SED party\". Minning wrote: \"Police force was used on numerous occasions to break up or prevent public gay and lesbian events. Centralised censorship prevented the presentation of homosexuality in print and electronic media, as well as the import of such materials.\"\n\nThe Protestant Church provided more support than the state, allowing meeting spaces and printing facilities.\n\nTowards the end of the 1980s, just before the collapse of the iron curtain, the East German Government opened a state-owned gay disco in Berlin. On 11 August 1987, the East German Supreme Court affirmed that \"\"homosexuality, just like heterosexuality, represents a variant of sexual behavior. Homosexual people do therefore not stand outside socialist society, and the civil rights are warranted to them exactly as to all other citizens\".\"\n\nIn 1988, the German Hygiene Museum in Dresden commissioned the state-owned film studio, DEFA, to make the documentary film \"Die andere Liebe\" (\"The Other Love\"). It was the first DEFA film about homosexuality and its aim was to convey official state acceptance. In 1989, the German Hygiene Museum also commissioned DEFA to make the GDR's only HIV/AIDS prevention documentary, \"Liebe ohne Angst\" (\"Love Without Fear\"). This did not focus on homosexuality directly but pointed out that AIDS was not a \"gay disease\".\nIn 1989, DEFA produced the film \"Coming Out\", directed by Heiner Carow, telling the story of an East German man coming to accept his homosexuality, with much of it shot in East Berlin gay bars. It was the only East German feature film on the theme of same-sex desire ever produced. It won a number of awards including a Silver Bear and Teddy Award at 40th Berlin International Film Festival, and awards at the National Feature Film Festival of the GDR.\n\nJürgen Lemke is considered one of the most prominent East German gay rights activists and has published a book on the subject (\"Gay Voices from East Germany\", English edition published in 1991). Lemke claimed that the gay community was far more united in the GDR than it was in the West.\n\nWest Germany inherited Paragraph 175, which remained on the books until 1969. However, as opposed to East Germany, the churches' influence in West Germany was very strong. Fundamentalist Protestants and the Roman Catholic Church were staunchly opposed to LGBT rights legislation.\n\nAs a result of these strong socially conservative influences, the German Christian Democratic Union, the dominant political force in post-war West Germany, tended to ignore or oppose most gay rights issues. While their frequent coalition partners the Free Democratic Party tended to have a stronger belief in civil liberties, they were, as a smaller party, less likely to alienate the more socially conservative elements in the larger Christian Democratic Union.\n\nDuring the Cold War era, support for gay rights in Germany was generally restricted to the Free Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party and, later in the 1980s, the Green Party. At the national level, advancements in gay rights did not begin to happen until the end of the Cold War and the electoral success of the Social Democratic Party. For example, in 1990, the law was changed so that homosexuality and bisexuality were no longer grounds for being discriminated against in the military.\n\nThe first kiss between two men on German television was shown in Rosa von Praunheim's film \"It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives\" (1971). This film marks the beginning of the German modern gay liberation movement. In 1986, the popular soap opera \"Lindenstraße\" showed the first gay kiss in a German TV series. From then on, many other television shows followed this example. The creation of private TV stations in 1984 resulted in a stronger LGBT presence in the media by the end of the decade. The station RTL in particular was very gay-friendly and some TV stars had come out by then.\n\nIn 2002, the German Government decided to overturn any convictions for homosexuality made during the Nazi period.\n\nIn May 2016, Justice Minister Heiko Maas announced that gay and bisexual men who were convicted of same-sex sexual activity after World War II would have their convictions overturned. Maas said the following in a statement:\nIn October 2016, the German Government announced the introduction of a draft law to pardon around 50,000 men for the prosecutions they endured due to their sexual orientation. On 22 March 2017, the Germany Cabinet officially approved the bill. The bill, which also foresees compensation of €3,000 (£2,600) for each conviction, plus €1,500 (£1,300) for every year of jail time, then had to obtain parliamentary approval. On 22 June 2017, the Bundestag (German Parliament) unanimously passed the bill to implement the scheme to rehabilitate gay and bisexual men. The bill then went back to the Bundesrat for final approval, and was signed into law by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on 17 July 2017.\n\nSame-sex couples have been legally recognized in Germany since 2001. That year, registered life partnerships (effectively, a form of civil union) were instituted, giving same-sex couples rights and obligations in areas such as inheritance, alimony, health insurance, immigration, hospital, jail visitations, and name change. Subsequently, the Constitutional Court repeatedly ruled in favor of same-sex couples in registered partnerships, requiring the Bundestag to make incremental changes to the partnership law. In one case, the European Court of Justice ruled that refusing a widow's pension to the same-sex partner of a deceased person is direct discrimination if the partnership was comparable to marriage (see also \"same-sex unions in the European Union\").\n\nEven though a majority of the political parties in the Bundestag supported legalising same-sex marriage, attempts to follow through with the proposal were repeatedly blocked by CDU/CSU, the largest parliamentary party and the dominant party in the government coalitions since 2005. This changed on the final sitting day of the Bundestag before the 2017 summer break, when the junior party in the coalition, the Social Democratic Party, introduced a bill to legalise same-sex marriage and adoption which had previously passed the Bundesrat in September 2015. German Chancellor Merkel moderated her stance on the issue by allowing members of the CDU/CSU to follow their personal conscience rather than the party line, which freed up moderate members who had long been in favour of same-sex marriage to vote for it. On 30 June 2017, the SPD, Die Linke and the Greens as well as 75 moderate members of the CDU/CSU formed a majority in the Bundestag to pass the bill by 393 votes to 226. The law came into effect three months after promulgation, on 1 October 2017.\n\nThe first same-sex weddings in Germany were celebrated on 1 October 2017. Berlin couple Karl Kreile and Bodo Mende, a couple for 38 years, were the first same-sex couple to exchange their vows under the new law and did so at the town hall of Schöneberg, Berlin.\n\nIn 2004, the registered partnership law (originally passed in 2001) was amended, effective on 1 January 2005, to give registered same-sex couples limited adoption rights (stepchild adoption only) and reform previously cumbersome dissolution procedures with regard to division of property and alimony. In 2013, the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled that if one partner in a same-sex relationship has adopted a child, the other partner has the right to become the adoptive mother or father of that child as well; this is known as \"successive adoption\". The same-sex marriage law, passed in June 2017, gave same-sex couples full adoption rights. On 10 October 2017, a court in Berlin's Kreuzberg district approved the first application for joint adoption of a child by a same-sex couple.\n\nThere is no legal right to assisted reproduction procedures for lesbian couples, such as artificial insemination and in vitro fertilisation, but such practices are not explicitly banned either. The German Medical Association is against explicit legalisation and directs its members not to perform such procedures. Since this directive is not legally binding, however, sperm banks and doctors may work with lesbian clients if they wish. This makes it harder for German lesbian couples to have children than in some other countries, but it is becoming increasingly popular. In addition, lesbian parents are not both automatically recognized on their child(ren)'s birth certificates, as one of the partners has to adopt the child(ren) of the other partner, whether biological or adopted. A bill initiated by Alliance 90/The Greens in June 2018 to rectify this inequality is pending in the Bundestag. In October 2018, the Federal Court of Justice (\"Bundesgerichtshof\") in Karlsruhe ruled that, unlike heterosexual couples, the wife of the child's legal mother does not automatically become a parent, and that an adoption is necessary. This specific case involved a lesbian couple from Saxony, who had converted their civil partnership in mid-October 2017 into a marriage. At the beginning of November, their child was born via artificial insemination. When trying to record the birth, only the biological mother was allowed to register. The couple then unsuccessfully applied to the registry office to correct the birth record so that the non-biological mother could also be listed as the child's mother. The office rejected this request, whereupon the woman filed suit. A district court in Chemnitz initially ruled for the couple, but the Dresden Higher Regional Court overturned this decision in April 2018. Eventually, after another appeal, the Federal Court of Justice ruled against them. In its judgment, the Court referenced Paragraph 1592 of the \"Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch\", which states that \"the father of a child is the man who at the moment of birth is married to the child's mother\".\n\nIn May 2019, Federal Minister of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth Franziska Giffey recommended that teachers use forms that are gender-neutral, which no longer use \"mother and father\" but instead \"parent 1 and parent 2\".\n\nLGBT people are not banned from military service.\n\nThe Bundeswehr maintained a \"glass ceiling\" policy that effectively banned homosexuals from becoming officers until 2000. First Lieutenant Winfried Stecher, an army officer demoted for his homosexuality, had filed a lawsuit against former Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping. Scharping vowed to fight the claim in court, claiming that homosexuality \"raises serious doubts about suitability and excludes employment in all functions pertaining to leadership\". However, before the case went to trial, the Defense Ministry reversed the policy. While the German Government declined to issue an official explanation for the reversal, it was widely believed that Scharping was overruled by former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and former Vice-Chancellor Joschka Fischer. Nowadays, according to general military orders given in the year 2000, tolerance towards all sexual orientations is considered to be part of the duty of military personnel. Sexual relationships and acts amongst soldiers outside service times, regardless of the sexual orientation, are defined to be \"irrelevant\", regardless of the rank and function of the soldier(s) involved, while harassment or the abuse of functions is considered a transgression, as well as the performance of sexual acts in active service. Transgender persons may also serve openly in the German Armed Forces.\n\nIn the fields of employment, goods and services, education and health services, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity is illegal throughout Germany.\n\nSome state constitutions have anti-discrimination laws that include sexual orientation and gender identity, including the constitutions of Berlin (since 1995), Brandenburg (since 1992), Bremen (since 2001), Saarland (since 2011) and Thuringia (since 1993), and Saxony-Anhalt in the public sector since 1997. Article 10(2) of the Berlin Constitution reads as follows:\nAs a signatory to the Treaty of Amsterdam, Germany was required to amend its national anti-discrimination laws to include, among others, sexual orientation. It failed to do so for six years, due to discussions about the scope of the proposed laws. Some of the proposals were debated because they actually surpassed the requirements of the Treaty of Amsterdam (namely, extending discrimination protection for all grounds of discrimination to the provision of goods and services); the final version of the law, however, was criticised as not fully complying with some parts of the Treaty, especially with respect to the specifications about the termination of work contracts through labor courts. The Bundestag finally passed the \"General Act on Equal Treatment\" () on 29 June 2006; the Bundesrat voted on it without discussion on 7 July 2006. Having come into force on 18 August 2006, the law bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, education, health services and the provision of goods and services.\n\nHate speeches on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity are banned in Germany. German law prohibits incitement to hatred based on membership to a certain social or ethnic group.\n\nIn 1994, although a majority in the Joint Constitutional Commission of the Bundestag and Bundesrat voted in favor of the inclusion of a prohibition on discrimination based on sexual identity in the Basic Law (), the required two-thirds majority was not achieved.\n\nIn June 2018, the states of Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Thuringia submitted a draft bill to the Bundesrat to amend article 3 of the Basic Law to add the characteristics \"sexual and gender identity\". In July, the draft proposal failed after the state of Berlin requested that it be rejected, as it became clear that the two-thirds majority would not be achieved.\n\nIn May 2019, the Alliance 90/The Greens, the Free Democratic Party and the Left proposed a joint legislative initiative to amend Article 3 of the Basic Law to ban discrimination on grounds of \"sexual identity\" ().\n\nSince 1980, the \"Gesetz über die Änderung der Vornamen und die Feststellung der Geschlechtszugehörigkeit in besonderen Fällen\" has stated that transgender persons may change their legal sex following sex reassignment surgery and sterilization. In January 2011, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that these two requirements were unconstitutional.\n\nSince 2013, German law has allowed children born with atypical sexual anatomy to have their gender left blank instead of being categorised as male (\"männlich\") or female (\"weiblich\"). The Swiss activist group \"Zwischengeschlecht\" criticised this law, arguing that \"if a child’s anatomy does not, in the view of physicians, conform to the category of male or the category of female, there is no option but to withhold the male or female labels given to all other children\". The German Ethics Council and the Swiss National Advisory Commission also criticised the law, saying that \"instead of individuals deciding for themselves at maturity, decisions concerning sex assignment are made in infancy by physicians and parents\".\n\nIn November 2017, the Federal Constitutional Court (\"Bundesverfassungsgericht\") ruled that civil status law must allow a third gender option. This means that intersex people will have another option besides being listed as female or male or having a blank gender entry. The Government presented its proposal on the matter in August 2018. Intersex individuals would be able to register themselves as \"divers\" on official documents. The proposal was approved by the Bundestag in December 2018, and took effect on 1 January 2019.\n\nConversion therapy has a negative effect on the lives of LGBT people, and can lead to low self-esteem, depression and suicide ideation. It is opposed by every medical organisation in Germany.\n\nIn 2008, the German Government declared itself completely opposed to the pseudoscientific practice. In 2013, the Alliance 90/The Greens introduced a draft bill to the Bundestag to ban conversion therapies among minors in the Bundestag, but it was never voted on. A petition to call on the Health Ministry to ban the practice was launched in July 2018, and had collected about 60,000 signatures by mid-August 2018.\n\nIn February 2019, openly gay German Health Minister Jens Spahn stated that he wants gay conversion therapy for both minors and adults to be made illegal, calling it \"a form of assault\". Spahn said he hopes to work together with Justice Minister Katarina Barley for a law to ban conversion therapy, that he hoped would be approved by the autumn of 2019. In April 2019, after an online petition on the issue started by international LGBT organisation All Out collected around 110,000 signatures, Spahn called for a commission to draft proposals on how exactly such a ban can be introduced. The panel would then present its final report in autumn. The commission met in May and June for two full-day workshops. Likewise, the Ministry of Health invited politicians, scientists and those affected, as well as institutions from abroad, who have already gained experience with legal prohibitions, to participate in the exchange. In June, Spahn presented in a press conference the results of two scientific reports that denounced conversion therapy, and called for a legal ban. In early November 2019, Spahn submitted a draft bill that would ban the use of conversion therapy on minors and punish those coercing, deceiving and threatening someone of any age into the practice. On 18 December, the Cabinet gave its approval to the draft bill, which would prohibit conversion therapy on all minors. Conversion therapy on adults would also be banned, provided there was \"lack of will power\" such as coercion, threats, deceit or misapprehension. The ban will also be in effect for psychotherapeutic and pastoral conversations, but only if \"the conversational partner purposefully tries to influence one's sexual orientation\". People charged with illegally performing conversion therapy may face up to one year in prison. Offering, promoting and referring to conversion therapy in case of minors will also be deemed illegal and may carry a fine of 30,000 €. Both people performing the therapies and legal guardians \"grossly violating their duty of care\" may be charged according to the Health Ministry. The ban is expected to become effective midyear 2020.\n\nParallel to Spahn's proposal, there is also an initiative of several federal states for a ban on conversion therapy. The states of Hesse, Berlin, Bremen, Saarland and Schleswig-Holstein have tabled a joint motion in the Bundesrat, which was presented in plenary on 12 April 2019. The states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia have agreed to the motion, while Bavaria expressed potential support, but with some modifications, after a resolution from the Greens was adopted by a majority in the Landtag of Bavaria. The motion was to be voted on in plenary in the Bundesrat in May, but was later postponed. Alongside legislative action in the Bundesrat, in March 2019, a bill to ban conversion therapies for minors and a motion with numerous measures to educate and support victims of such practices was presented by the Green parliamentary group in the Bundestag.\nOn May 7, 2020, German parliament Bundestag banned nationwide conversion therapy for minors until 18 years and forbids advertising of conversion therapy. It also forbids conversion therapy for adults, if they decided by force, fraud or pressure.\n\nBone marrow donation has been allowed since December 2014.\n\nIn June 2016, German health ministers announced that the ban on gay and bisexual men donating blood would be lifted, replacing it with a one-year deferral period. The proposal to lift the ban was championed by Monika Bachmann, Saarland's Health Minister. Since summer 2017, gay and bisexual men have been allowed to donate blood, provided they haven't had sex for twelve months.\n\nThere are several prominent German politicians who are openly gay. Among them are former Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit (having outed himself with the famous words \"Ich bin schwul – und das ist auch gut so!\" [English: \"I am gay – and that's a good thing!\"]) and Johannes Kahrs (from the SPD); Volker Beck, Kai Gehring, Ulle Schauws, Gerhard Schick and Anja Hajduk (from the Green Party); Harald Petzold (The Left); Jens Spahn and Stefan Kaufmann (both CDU); Bernd Fabritius (from the CSU); Michael Kauch and Guido Westerwelle, respectively former federal Foreign Minister and former head of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). In addition, former Hamburg Mayor Ole von Beust (CDU) did not deny anything when his father outed him but considered it a private matter; after leaving office he began talking about his homosexuality. In July 2007, Karin Wolff, then Minister of Education for Hesse, came out as a lesbian. In December 2013, Barbara Hendricks (SPD), the Federal Minister for the Environment in the Third Merkel Cabinet, came out as lesbian. In 2012, Michael Ebling (SPD) became the Mayor of Mainz. In 2013 and 2015, Sven Gerich (SPD) and Thomas Kufen (CDU) became the openly gay mayors of Wiesbaden and Essen, respectively.\n\nThe right-wing party Alternative for Germany (AfD) is opposed to full LGBT rights and opposes same-sex marriage, but is in favour of registered partnerships. The Christian-conservative parties, the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU), support basic rights such as registered partnerships and some of its members support same-sex marriages. All other major parties, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), The Left (Die Linke), Alliance '90/The Greens (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) support LGBT rights, including same-sex marriage.\n\nA May 2019 study revealed that 6.9% of the population of Germany identified as LGBTI. The study also showed that 10.6% of the population of Cologne between the ages of 18 and 75 described themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex or queer. This accounted to over 87,000 people in the city.\n\nA 2013 Pew Research Center poll indicated that 87% of Germans believed that homosexuality should be accepted by society, which was the second highest in the world (only 39 countries were polled) following Spain (88%).\n\nNevertheless, 46% of 20,000 German LGBT people said they had experienced discrimination because of their sexual orientation and gender identity in the past year per the 2013 results of a survey by EU's Fundamental Rights Agency (47% was the EU average). Two-thirds of respondents said they concealed their sexual orientation at school and in public life and a fifth felt discriminated at work.\n\nIn May 2015, PlanetRomeo, an LGBT social network, published its first Gay Happiness Index (GHI). Gay men from over 120 countries were asked about how they feel about society’s view on homosexuality, how they experience the way they are treated by other people and how satisfied are they with their lives. Germany was ranked 14th with a GHI score of 68.\n\nA 2017 poll found that 83% of Germans supported same-sex marriage, 16% were against. For comparison, the 2015 Eurobarometer found that 66% of Germans thought that same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, 29% were against.\n\n(*) Some states have their own anti-discrimination laws that include sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n\n"}

It was the first album to feature Coltrane playing soprano saxophone. An edited version of the title track became a hit single that gained popularity in 1961 on radio. The record became a major commercial success. In 1998, the album received the Grammy Hall of Fame award. It attained gold record status in 2018, having sold 500,000 copies.\n\nIn 2000 it was voted number 392 in Colin Larkin's \"All Time Top 1000 Albums\".\n\nIn March 1960, while on tour in Europe, Miles Davis purchased a soprano saxophone for Coltrane. While the instrument had been used in the early days of jazz (notably by Sidney Bechet) it had become rare by the 1950s with the exception of Steve Lacy. Intrigued by its capabilities, Coltrane began playing it at his summer club dates.\n\nAfter leaving the Davis band, Coltrane, for his first regular bookings at New York's Jazz Gallery in the summer of 1960, assembled the first version of the John Coltrane Quartet. The lineup settled by autumn with McCoy Tyner on piano, Steve Davis on bass, and Elvin Jones on drums. Sessions the week before Halloween at Atlantic Studios yielded the track \"Village Blues\" for \"Coltrane Jazz\" and the entirety of this album along with the tracks that Atlantic later assembled into \"Coltrane Plays the Blues\" and \"Coltrane's Sound\".\n\nThe title track is a modal rendition of the Rodgers and Hammerstein song \"My Favorite Things\" from \"The Sound of Music\". The melody is heard numerous times throughout, but instead of playing solos over the written chord changes, both Tyner and Coltrane take extended solos over vamps of the two tonic chords, E minor and E major, played in waltz time. In the documentary \"The World According to John Coltrane\", narrator Ed Wheeler remarks on the impact that this song's popularity had on Coltrane's career:\nIn 1960, Coltrane left Miles [Davis] and formed his own quartet to further explore modal playing, freer directions, and a growing Indian influence. They transformed \"My Favorite Things\", the cheerful populist song from 'The Sound of Music,' into a hypnotic eastern dervish dance. The recording was a hit and became Coltrane's most requested tune—and a bridge to broad public acceptance.\n\nOn March 3, 1998, Rhino Records reissued \"My Favorite Things\" as part of its Atlantic 50th Anniversary Jazz Gallery series. Included as bonus tracks were both sides of the \"My Favorite Things\" single, released as Atlantic 5012 in 1961.\n\n\n\n"}

She was born in London and educated at a convent, which she left at the age of 14.

She only learnt to read at nine years old and \"whenever my father saw my appalling spelling, he would laugh. But it wasn't an unkind laugh. In his laugh there was the message, 'You are a completely original person, and everything you do has your own mark on it.' He wanted us all to be unique,\" she says.\n\nAlthough she came from an upper-class background, in 1959 Dunn moved to Battersea, made friends there and worked for a time in a sweet factory. This world inspired much of what Dunn would later write. Dunn was married to writer Jeremy Sandford from 1957 to 1979. The couple had three sons. She attended the Courtauld Institute of Art.<ref>\n"}

It is situated in an agricultural and pastoral district on the Sturt Highway, east of the Barossa Valley, where the highway crosses somewhat lofty and rugged parts of the Mount Lofty Ranges. At the , Truro had a population of 395.\nTruro is in the Mid Murray Council local government area, the South Australian House of Assembly electoral district of Schubert and the Australian House of Representatives Division of Barker.\n\nThe town was established on Truro Creek (White Hut Creek) in 1848 by John Howard Angas, the son of George Fife Angas who had bought the land in 1842. The survey was conducted by Thomas Burr, assisted by his (eventual) son in law Frederick Sinnett, during a period when both were freed from their usual commitments in order to pursue private contracts.\n\nIt is named after the city of Truro in Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is somewhat uncertain whether the name Truro was given by Angas, or the first settlers in the town, but with the Wheal Barton mine nearby, many of those settlers were Cornish miners, so it is quite likely that if they were not the namers of the town, they were certainly the inspiration thereof. The township of Barton was also nearby, however that soon became a part of Truro.\n\nIt was formerly the seat of its own municipality, the District Council of Truro, from 1876 to 1991.\n\nTruro has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\n\nThe first industry that European settlers introduced to Truro district, from the early 1840s, was pastoralism, primarily the grazing of sheep flocks, watched over by shepherds, on unfenced occupation licenses. Many of the picturesque dry stone walls so prevalent in the district date from this era.\n\nCopper was discovered in 1846 and was mined at the Wheal Barton mine 2 km east of Truro from 1849 to 1889 and again between 1956 and 1972. These copper mines are what led to the survey and establishment of the town. The mine was established in 1849, and a church erected in the township by August 1850.\n\nTruro was the terminus of the Truro railway line from its opening in 1917 until it ceased operating in the 1970s and was permanently closed in the 1980s.\n\nRainfall in Truro is lower than in the neighbouring Barossa Valley region. For this reason dry grain crop farming, mainly of wheat and barley, is more prevalent than viticulture.\n\nThere are two hotels in Truro. Truro also has several tourism offerings, in the form of the recently renovated Pioneer Park, a specialist olive shop and several antique shops. The town is also notable for its service facilities, particularly its bakeries, which provide refreshment for tourists and travellers along the Sturt Highway. The breads and pastries are remarkable, not only for their large range but also for unifying traditional English and Cornish cuisine with German from the nearby Barossa Valley.\n\nDuring the 1970s the town of Truro gained unwarranted notoriety due to human remains being found scattered among nondescript Mallee scrub upon the arid Murray Plains near Sandleton. This became widely known as the Truro murders, one of the notable occurrences of serial killing in Australian history. Those human remains were actually found many tens of kilometres away from Truro, but, despite these tragic crimes being unrelated to the Truro township, the broadcast media found 'Truro' to be a convenient label for them through being the nearest town recognizable to the public.\n"}

It was followed by three more titles: \"Sega Worldwide Soccer '98\" still on the 32-bit console and two editions of \"Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000\", the second being \"Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000 Euro Edition\" for the Dreamcast.\n\n\"Sega Worldwide Soccer 97\", produced by Sega themselves, was one of the killer apps in the peak of popularity for the console. It was the sequel to \"Victory Goal\", one of the debut titles of the console, which had a poor performance critically and commercially. However, there was little overlap in the development staff of the two games.\n\nThe game featured international teams and league, play-off and tournament modes. Although it used fictional player names (due to the lack of a license), the non-volatile memory of the Saturn allowed editing of names. The team kits were as close to the official 1996 kits as possible. The gameplay was also highly praised, and was the top-rated football game until \"International Superstar Soccer 64\" was released one year later. \"Sega Worldwide Soccer 97\" was later ported to the PC, under the title of \"Sega Worldwide Soccer PC\".\n\nIn exhibition mode, the player(s) compete in a single match. In tournament mode, they go through an entire tournament, and in championship mode, they battle for the title of league champions.\n\nThe game includes a create-a-player feature.\n\nThe original release on the Saturn was met with critical acclaim. Tom Hall of \"GameSpot\" said it \"may be the best soccer game ever released\"; \"GamePro\"s The Weekend Warrior called it \"a completely fresh, must-play gaming experience\"; Rob Alsetter wrote in \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" that it was \"perhaps the best soccer sim yet\"; and \"Next Generation\"s review concluded that \"Quite simply, \"WWS '97\" is the best recreation of any sport, ever.\" Common subjects of praise were the smoothness of the player animations, the easy-to-learn controls, the realistic soccer elements, and the way the game encourages players to be spontaneous and creative.\n\nThough \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" never reviewed the game, less than a year after its release they rated the Saturn version the 74th best console video game of all time, saying that it \"set the standard for all other soccer games to follow. As such, it is considered to be the 'Madden' or 'NHL' of soccer.\" They cited the player animations, intelligent AI, realistic passing, and graphics.\n\n"}
{"id": "1799400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799400", "title": "LGBT rights in Bulgaria", "text": "LGBT rights in Bulgaria\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Bulgaria may face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in Bulgaria, but same-sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has been banned since 2004, with discrimination based on \"gender change\" being outlawed since 2015. In July 2019, a Bulgarian court recognized a same-sex marriage performed in France in a landmark ruling.\n\nBulgaria, like most countries in Central and Eastern Europe, holds socially conservative attitudes when it comes to such issues as homosexuality.\n\nHomosexuality was legalized in 1858 in all parts of Ottoman Empire. After the Liberation of Bulgaria however, homosexuality was recriminalized with the adoption of a new constitution in 1879.\n\nFollowing the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, the country's Penal Code came into force on 1 May 1896, and homosexual acts between males over 16 years of age became punishable by at least six months of imprisonment. The Penal Code of 13 March 1951 increased the penalty to up to three years in jail. The revised Penal Code of 1 May 1968 removed the sections outlawing homosexual acts.\n\nIn July 1964, 26 men were arrested and accused of having \"perverted homosexual relationships\". Some of the arrested were the famous actor Georgi Partsalev and one of the most loved Bulgarian singers, Emil Dimitrov. Experts say that the process was a masquerade for the public so that \"people will understand how decadent the Western culture is\". In the 1960s, there were a couple of other similar cases which again involved some of Bulgaria's elite.\n\nLater, in 1966, when revising the Penal Code, a group of experts decided that homosexual acts would no longer be considered a crime because lesbians and gays \"are ill people, who shouldn't be punished because of the sufferings they are already going through (due to their illness)\". On 1 May 1968, the Penal Code was revised, and homosexuality became legal.\n\nSince 2002, the age of consent has been 14, regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nSince 1991, Article 46 of the Bulgarian Constitution has defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman, therefore banning same-sex marriage.\n\nIn 2012, on the question if same-sex couples will soon have further rights like the right to marry or adopt children, Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said: \"for something [like this] to happen, society needs to become ready for it.\" There have been several debates on whether to recognise civil unions or registered partnerships, which would grant same-sex couples some of the rights and benefits of marriage, including the right to inherit, to make medical decisions, to own property together; all of which are currently denied to same-sex couples.\n\nIn 2017, a Bulgarian same-sex couple, who married in the United Kingdom, filed a lawsuit in order to have their marriage recognised. The Sofia Administrative Court rejected their case in January 2018. However, lawyers from the Bulgarian LGBT organisation Deystvie (Действие) appealed against this decision. Deystvie has begun public collecting signatures in favor of their appeal.\n\nCiting \"Coman and Others v General Inspectorate for Immigration and Ministry of the Interior\", a case originating from Romania in which the European Court of Justice ruled that same-sex couples must be granted full residency rights in all EU countries, a Sofia court granted a same-sex couple the right to live in Bulgaria on 29 June 2018. The couple, an Australian woman and her French spouse, had married in France in 2016, but were denied residency in Bulgaria a year later when they attempted to move there.\n\nSame-sex couples are banned from adopting in Bulgaria. However, single individuals regardless of sexual orientation are allowed to adopt, though requests from single men are rarely accepted. Lesbian couples do not have access to IVF and artificial insemination, as it is only available to married opposite-sex couples. Nevertheless, since 2004, single lesbian women have had access to IVF.\n\nSince 1 January 2004, the \"Protection Against Discrimination Act of 2003\" () has prohibited discrimination and hate speech on the basis of sexual orientation in all areas (employment, the provision of goods and services, education, military service, health services, etc.). Under the law, sexual orientation is defined as \"heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual orientation\".\n\nIn 2015, the National Assembly amended the definition of \"sex\" in the law to include cases of gender change. Transgender people who have not undergone a legal gender change could use \"gender\" from the list of protected grounds. Gender expression and gender identity are not explicitly mentioned in the revised Act.\n\nHate crimes against LGBT people are not uncommon in Bulgaria, and are often ignored and go uninvestigated by authorities. In 2008, a 25-year-old student was brutally killed in a park in Sofia because he was perceived to be gay. During the investigation, a man testified that the two suspects were part of a group intending to \"cleanse\" the park of gays.\n\nIn January 2014, the Government committed itself to outlaw hate crimes against LGBT people. However, following parliamentary elections in October 2014, the newly established Government has been silent on the issue. As of 2019, Bulgaria's Penal Code still does not protect LGBT people from hate crimes.\n\nThe \"Bulgarian Personal Documents Act\" (), which came into effect on 1 April 1999, was the first law in Bulgaria regulating sex changes. There is no official data on the number of Bulgarians who have legally changed their gender. When a person undergoes sex reassignment surgery, they can change their passport, driver's license, personal identity document, birth certificate and uniform civil number to match their new sex. One cannot undergo sex reassignment surgery unless going to court and receiving a positive court decision. Other requirements include being at least 18 years of age and undergoing sterilization. Furthermore, such procedures are not covered by the state, and thus can be very costly. Without undergoing sex reassignment surgery, a person cannot change their legal gender in any official document. In 2016, however, three transgender women were allowed to change gender without undergoing surgery.\n\nA 2015 Eurobarometer survey found that only 29% of Bulgarians agreed with the statement that transgender people should be able to change their civil documents in order to match their inner gender identity.\n\nAfter the Constitutional Court's verdict on the Istanbul Convention, in which the court condemned attempts to introduce legislation for legal gender recognition, a transgender woman's application to change gender was rejected by a regional court.\n\nIntersex persons in Bulgaria are even more marginalized and invisible in society than the transgender community. There is no data of the number of intersex babies born in the country. The standard procedure in a case of an intersex child birth is the removal of the male genitalia due to the fact that it is an easier operation than the one removing the female genitalia. The parents are rarely informed of the damages this could later cause to the child's gender identity. There are no laws concerning intersex people.\n\nBulgaria's \"Protection Against Discrimination Act of 2003\" protects individuals from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in relation to recruitment to the military.\n\nGay and bisexual men are not explicitly banned from donating blood in Bulgaria, but many medical professionals, especially outside of Sofia, will not allow them to if informed about their sexual orientation. However, the blood donor application form, required prior to any blood donation, does not ask the applicant to disclose that information, rather requires them to confirm that they did not partake in practices (sexual included) that increase the risk of HIV or other STIs. The consent form is detailed in an ordinance issued by Bulgaria's Ministry of Healthcare on 19 July 2004.\n\nA 2002 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey recorded that 63% of Bulgarians were \"openly homophobic\" and against LGBT people, and the 2007 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey recorded that acceptance of the LGBT community had risen to 39%.\n\nA 2006 European Union poll showed that 15% of Bulgarians supported same-sex marriage, with 65% opposed to it. In 2015, those numbers remained almost the same, with 17% supporting same-sex marriage and 68% being opposed.\n\nAccording to a survey in 2007 by Skala, a sociological agency, 42.4% of Bulgarians would not like having a homosexual friend or colleague. 46% answered that it would be unacceptable if their own child was gay or lesbian. A Eurobarometer survey from 2015 showed that only 9% of Bulgarian parents would accept their child being in a same-sex relationship.\n\nAccording to a 2008 survey, conducted in 15 schools throughout Sofia, Varna and Plovdiv, 10.5% of students identified as bisexual, whereas 1.8% identified as gay and 87.7% as straight. Of these students, 15% said they wouldn't want a gay friend and 29% said they would categorically refuse to sit next to a gay classmate. 5% said they would bully gay classmates, while 39% said they would protect them from bullying.\n\nA survey from 2012 showed the number of people who wouldn't like having a homosexual colleague had dropped to 38%. The survey also showed that Bulgarians were more tolerant toward lesbians than gay men. 26% of the respondents wouldn't hire a lesbian.\n\nA Pew Research Center published in May 2017 suggested that 18% of Bulgarians were in favor of same-sex marriage, while 79% opposed it. Support was higher among Orthodox Christians (19%) and 18–34 year olds (26%), in contrast to Muslims (12%) and people aged 35 and over (15%).\n\nMost of gay life in Bulgaria is primarily set in Sofia. There are gay establishments in Plovdiv, Varna and Blagoevgrad. Outside of the big cities, the subject is a taboo and rarely welcomed or admitted to be relevant or real. As this is still a highly controversial subject in Bulgaria, accurate data cannot be obtained due to the unwillingness of some or most persons who identify as LGBT to freely affirm themselves as such out of fear of public persecution, scrutiny or harassment.\n\nIn December 2018, billboards promoting tolerance towards same-sex couples, put up in various Bulgarian cities such as Varna and Bourgas, were vandalised.\n\nThe only pride parade to take place so far in Bulgaria is Sofia Pride. The first parade took place in 2008 and drew about 150 participants, who were attacked with petrol bombs, rocks and glass bottles. More than 60 hooligans were arrested. The pride parades in the following years went on peacefully and started drawing more participants as well as the support of political parties, local businesses and embassies. In 2017, the parade was attended by more than 3,000 participants and was supported by 18 diplomatic missions. The pride week also included a film program and an art festival. In 2019, around 6,000 attendees marched in the gay pride parade. It was supported by 25 diplomats and representatives of international organizations and foundations.\n\nThe Bulgarian Orthodox Church strongly opposes freedom of assembly for LGBT people and any form of manifestation like pride parades, calling them a \"sinful demonstration\" and the \"sin of sodomy\". Before the 2012 Sofia Pride, a priest from Sliven, said in a newspaper interview that \"gays should be beaten with stones\". National Resistance, a far-right group, has advocated using brooms and shovels to attack people at pride parades.\n\nParties such as the Bulgarian Socialist Party, the Greens, Bulgarian Left and DSB have supported the parade organizers' right to hold the pride parade. However, in 2014, only the Greens and Bulgarian Left sent statements of support to the parade. Georgi Kadiev, the former Bulgarian Socialist Party mayoral candidate for Sofia, participated in support of the pride parade in 2011. Some parties, such as the far-right nationalist Ataka party, strongly oppose the pride parades, protesting against them, as well as homosexuality more broadly.\n\nThere are several LGBT organizations in Bulgaria: \n\nIn November 2009, the District Council of Pazardzhik voted in favor of an amendment, forbidding the \"public demonstration of sexual or any other orientation.\" LGBT organizations attacked the decision of the council, arguing it was discriminatory. In October 2010, the district's Administrative Court struck down the resolution, citing procedural errors in its passing. The court's decision was affirmed on appeal by the Supreme Administrative Court in July 2011.\n\n\n"}

Brough in Nottingham, England, from 1902 to 1926 , after some earlier experimentation with motorised tricycles. The Brough Superior company was a separate company created by his son, George Brough.\n\nThe first Brough motorcycle was built in 1902, and had a single cylinder engine hung from the downtube. By 1908 there were a range of models with 2.5 hp and 3.5 hp single cylinder and 5 hp V-twin engines (all made by Brough). By 1912 there was a 6 hp V-twin, and an 8 hp engine was also made intended for use in the Brough Monocar.\n\nIn 1913 William Brough developed a flat-twin engine in-line with the frame. This 497cc engine had overhead valves, 70mm bore and 64.5mm stroke, and had a magneto fitted above and a 2-speed gearbox below. By the end of 1914 it had replaced all other engines in the Brough range, and using it only 3-models were planned for 1915. The three models were the HS - which was fitted with a two-speed countershaft gear operated by dog clutches, with chain drive to the gearbox, and John Bull rubber belt drive to the rear wheel over an adjustable pulley allowing the top gear range to be varied. No clutch or kick-start was provided. The second model was the HB, which was fitted with a Sturmey-Archer 3-speed hub gearbox and handle starter. The third model was the HTT, which was very similar to the HS but fitted with a specially tuned engine with high-compression, lightweight steel pistons, different camshafts, and special front cylinder lubrication.\n\nDuring the war Brough introduced a larger flat-twin of 6 hp rating, with 70mm bore and 90mm stroke (692cc), it shared a lot in common with the earlier 6 hp V-twin.\n\nAt the end of 1918, Brough announced they would be initially concentrating production on their 3.5 hp (489cc) flat-twin motorcycle. This was bench tested at 14 bhp at 4200rpm, and it would go to 5600rpm, which was quite high but was guaranteed by George Brough 'to the extent of £100'. The engine had detachable heads with the valve seats integral and the rockers 'enclosed in neat aluminium cases'. Light aluminium pistons, roller bearing crankshaft, and two ball bearing mounted camshafts, are further indications of development work during the war.\n\nOriginally William Brough's son, George Brough, was a partner in his father's company, but he split from it in 1919 and started his own factory, also in Nottingham. He named his motorcycles \"Brough Superior\". Upon hearing the name of the new motorcycle company, his father made the comment, \"I suppose that makes mine the Brough Inferior\".\n\nThe two sizes of Brough flat-twin engine were still in production in 1922 when Brough announced a modified version with roller cam followers, light aluminium pistons, removable valve seats, and the engine base extended to mount the three-speed Sturmey-Archer gearbox. William Brough continued to produce motorcycles under the original \"Brough\" marque until 1926.\n"}

American Medical Association, 895 F.2d 352 (7th Cir. 1990), was a federal antitrust suit brought against the American Medical Association (AMA) and 10 co-defendants by chiropractor Chester A. Wilk, DC, and four co-plaintiffs. It resulted in a ruling against the AMA.\n\nUntil 1983, the AMA held that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with an \"unscientific practitioner,\" and labeled chiropractic \"an unscientific cult.\"\n\nBefore 1980, \nPrinciple 3 of the AMA Principles of medical ethics stated: \"\"A physician should practice a method of healing founded on a scientific basis; and he should not voluntarily professionally associate with anyone who violates this principle.\"\" In 1980 during a major revision of ethical rules (while the Wilk litigation was in progress), it replaced Principle 3, stating that a physician \"shall be free to choose whom to serve, with whom to associate, and the environment in which to provide medical services.\" Also, up until 1974, the AMA had a Committee on quackery which challenged what it considered to be unscientific forms of healing. Wilk argued that this committee was established specifically to undermine chiropractic.\n\nIn 1976, Chester Wilk and four other chiropractors sued the AMA, several nationwide healthcare associations, and several physicians for violations of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The plaintiffs lost at the first trial in 1981, then obtained a new trial on appeal in 1983 because of improper jury instructions and admission of irrelevant and prejudicial evidence (\"Wilk v. American Medical Ass'n\",735 F.2d 217, 7th Cir. 1983).\n\nIn the second trial case the AMA had the burden of proof, needing to establish the validity of the boycott. The court recognized a \"patient care defense,\" but imposed a difficult burden. The defendants had to show their concern could not have been adequately satisfied in a manner less restrictive of competition. So \"Wilk\" and later cases greatly limit the use of \"quality of care\" defense in boycott cases.\n\nJust before the second trial, the plaintiffs dropped their demand for damages and sought only an injunction. Therefore, the resulting trial in May and June 1987 was a bench trial in which Judge Susan Getzendanner personally heard the evidence and made factual findings.\n\nOn September 25, 1987, Getzendanner issued her opinion that the AMA had violated Section 1, but not 2, of the Sherman Act, and that it had engaged in an unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade \"to contain and eliminate the chiropractic profession.\" (\"Wilk v. American Medical Ass'n\", 671 F. Supp. 1465, N.D. Ill. 1987). She further stated that the \"AMA had entered into a long history of illegal behavior\". And, she then issued a permanent injunction against the AMA under Section 16 of the Clayton Act to prevent such future behavior. However, she exonerated the two other remaining defendants, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals and the American College of Physicians, and dismissed them from the case.\n\nJudge Getzendanner also went out of her way to make clear what she was \"not\" doing: \n\nHowever Judge Getzendanner went on:\n\nShe concluded that the AMA had been too restrictive in its campaign:\n\nBoth sides cross-appealed, and the district court's decision was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals on February 7, 1990 (\"Wilk v. American Medical Ass'n\",895 F.2d 352, 7th Cir. 1990). The AMA petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court three times, but each time the Court denied \"certiorari\" (on June 11, August 13, and November 26, 1990).\n\nThe AMA eliminated Principle 3 in 1980 during a major revision of ethical rules (while the \"Wilk\" litigation was in progress). Its replacement stated that a physician \"shall be free to choose whom to serve, with whom to associate, and the environment in which to provide medical services.\" Thus, the AMA now permits medical doctors to refer patients to doctors of chiropractic for such manipulative therapy if the medical doctor believes it is in the best interests of the patients.\n"}

Ross, Skye and Lochaber includes the Black Isle on the east coast of Scotland and, in the west, the Hebridean island of Skye.\n\nWhen created in 2005, the Ross, Skye and Lochaber constituency covered 26 out of the 80 wards of the council area: 11 wards (Avoch and Fortrose, Black Isle North, Conon and Maryburgh, Dingwall North, Dingwall South, Gairloch, Knockbain and Killearnan, Lochbroom, Lochcarron, Muir of Ord and Strathpeffer and Strathconon) out of the 18 wards of the Ross and Cromarty committee area, all of the six wards of the Skye and Lochalsh area committee, all of the eight wards of the Lochaber committee area and one ward (Beauly and Strathglass) out of the 23 wards of the Inverness area committee.\n\nWard boundaries were redrawn again in 2007, and the management areas were abolished in favour of three new corporate management areas. The new areas consist of groups of the new wards, and boundaries are similar to those of the Westminster constituencies, as created in 2005. Two areas, the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross area and the Ross, Skye and Lochaber area, have the names of Westminster constituencies. The name of the third area, the Inverness, Nairn, and Badenoch and Strathspey area, is very similar to that of the third constituency.\n"}
{"id": "1799406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799406", "title": "National Police Memorial (United Kingdom)", "text": "National Police Memorial (United Kingdom)\n\nThe National Police Memorial is a memorial in central London, commemorating about 4000 police officers killed in the course of their duties in the United Kingdom. It was designed by Lord Foster of Thames Bank and Per Arnoldi and unveiled in 2005. The Project Architect for Foster was Peter Ridley.\n\nIn 1984, following the shooting of Yvonne Fletcher, film director Michael Winner founded the Police Memorial Trust. Initially the Trust concentrated on erecting smaller monuments at the points where officers had died on duty. From the mid-1990s the Trust also lobbied and raised funds for a single, larger scale memorial to commemorate all police officers who had died in the course of their duties. Winner stated that \"Memorials to soldiers, sailors and airmen are commonplace, but the police fight a war with no beginning and no end\".\n\nWinner donated £500,000 of his own money to the campaign for a national memorial and the remainder of the total cost of £2.3 million was met by a public collection. After a ten-year campaign, Westminster City Council granted planning permission in October 2002.\n\nThe Memorial was built to a design by Lord Foster of Thames Bank and Danish designer Per Arnoldi, on the corner of The Mall and Horse Guards Road, directly outside the Old Admiralty Building. The site was occupied at the time by an air shaft on the Bakerloo line of the London Underground.\n\nOn 22 July 2004 a symbolic groundbreaking ceremony took place on the site, performed by Prime Minister Tony Blair, Michael Winner, and officers from the Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police, representing the two forces with the highest number of officers killed in the line of duty.\nThe Memorial was formally unveiled on 26 April 2005 by Queen Elizabeth and Tony Blair. Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy, the leaders of the UK's other leading political parties at the time, were also present. A guard of honour was provided by 56 officers wearing the uniforms of each of the UK's police forces. The Queen stated that \"It is surely appropriate that this should be positioned in The Mall - an area of London so often associated with our national way of life. When people pass by the memorial, I hope they will pause and reflect on the proud traditions that it represents. The courage and personal sacrifice recorded here will, I am certain, serve as an inspiration to us all.\"\n\nDespite concerns over the potential cost, construction of the Memorial eventually came in at £400,000 under budget, in part because a number of the contractors concerned carried out their work free of charge.\n\nThe Memorial was a winner of the Royal Institute of British Architects award for 2006. Michael Winner publicly voiced some surprise at the structure being included in the \"Arts and Leisure\" classification.\n\nThe Memorial consists of two distinct architectural elements, linked by a terrace of Purbeck stone. A black rectangular creeper-covered enclosure surrounds the air shaft, forming a single block. The northern face of the enclosure is kept free of creepers, and is inscribed with the police badge of office and the text \"The National Police Memorial: Honouring Those Who Serve\". This face also includes a vitrine in which the Roll of Honour is displayed.\n\nImmediately north of the block, a glass column is sited in a reflecting pool. The column is internally illuminated by fibre optic cables with a faint blue light, symbolising the blue lamp which traditionally hangs outside police stations in the United Kingdom. The column is intended to screen the vitrine from passing traffic on The Mall. The column is 7.4m high, consisting of 622 stacked sheets of glass (a total surface area of 954m), weighing 28.6 tonnes.\n\nThe Memorial contains the UK Police Roll of Honour behind a glass panel, containing the names of approximately 4000 officers killed whilst on duty, in the course of effecting an arrest or whilst carrying out hazardous duties. The earliest entry is that of Watchman Isaac Smith, who died of injuries in 1680. The book is compiled from the approximately 4000 names recorded by the Police Roll of Honour Trust, listing all officers who have died in the line of duty.\n\nThe Memorial attracted criticism from some families of officers killed in the line of duty, regarding the high cost, and that the roll of honour lists only those officers killed during arrests or as a result of criminal acts, rather than all officers killed in the line of duty; also that, with the book being behind glass, friends and relatives of the deceased are not able to view the relevant page. Before construction, objections were also raised to the Memorial's construction by the London Historical Parks Group and the local residents' association. Concern was also raised by some Irish republicans that the Memorial includes the names of those RUC officers killed in The Troubles.\n\n"}

After police searches, the remains of seven women were discovered in total: five at Truro, one at Wingfield, and one at Port Gawler. The women had been murdered over a two-month period in 1976–1977.\n\nOn 25 April 1978, William \"Bill\" Thomas and Valda Thomas found what they thought was the bone from the leg of a cow whilst mushrooming in bushland beside Swamp Road near the South Australian town of Truro located about 70 km northeast of Adelaide. Valda had concerns about the find and two days later convinced her husband to have another look. Upon closer inspection, they noted that the bone had a shoe attached; inside the shoe was human skin and painted toenails. Clothes, blood stains, and more bones were found nearby. The remains were later identified as those of Veronica Knight, an 18-year-old woman who had vanished from an Adelaide street around Christmas of 1976. The lack of an obvious cause of death along with the location led to a belief that Knight may have gotten lost and died of thirst so the death was not considered suspicious. Almost one year later, on 15 April 1979, police discovered the skeletal remains of 16-year-old Sylvia Pittman, about 1 km from where Knight's remains had been located. Pittman had disappeared around the same time as Knight.\n\nThere was the strong suggestion of a link between the two dead women found in the Truro bushland and five other young women reported missing in Adelaide at the time, and Australian police faced the difficult task of piecing together evidence.\n\nEleven days later a huge search party discovered two more skeletons in a paddock on the opposite side of Swamp Road. They were the remains of Connie Iordanides and Vicki Howell, two of the five missing young women.\n\nChristopher Worrell aged 23, described as young, charismatic and sociopathic, and James Miller, a 38-year-old labourer, described as a drifter and homosexual partner of Worrell, are believed to have committed the murders.\n\nMiller and Worrell met when they were in prison together, Miller for breaking and entering, Worrell for rape and breaching a two-year suspended sentence for armed robbery. After release they formed a dominant/submissive relationship and both lived and worked together. Miller was infatuated with him and Worrell would allow Miller to perform sexual acts on him while he read pornographic, and predominantly BDSM, magazines. As Worrell preferred women this later ceased and they became more like brothers.\n\nWorrell and a female friend were killed in a car crash on 19 February 1977, thus ending the murders. Miller survived the car accident.\n\nMiller suffered depression and became homeless after Worrell's death. Miller's state of mind and a chance comment were to eventually give police a breakthrough when at Worrell's funeral, his former girlfriend, Amelia, told Miller that Worrell had had a suspected blood clot on the brain. This announcement prompted Miller to tell her about Worrell's fascination with thrill killing, suggesting that the clot might possibly have been responsible for the moods that led Worrell to kill.\n\nIn May 1979, she collected a A$30,000 reward after providing the information to police leading to Miller's arrest and capture. Amelia said that she had not come forward earlier because she had no proof the admission was true and that there was not much point in going to the police as Worrell was dead. It was only after reading of the murders in the newspaper that she came forward. It is highly likely that the murders would have gone unsolved if Amelia had not come forward.\n\nMiller was brought in for questioning on 23 May 1979. Initially he denied knowing anything, but eventually stated that Amelia had \"\"done what I should have\"\" and told detectives that there were three more bodies. Miller was driven under guard to Truro, Port Gawler and the Wingfield dump where he pointed out their locations.\n\n\nMiller continued to visit Skuse and Worrell at the cemeteries. He could never forget them. One year to the day after their death, Miller placed a few paragraphs in the \"In Memoriam\" notices in the Adelaide \"Advertiser\" which read:\n\n\"Worrell, Christopher Robin.<br>\nMemories of a very close<br>\nfriend who died 12 months<br>\nago this week, Your friendship<br>\nand thoughtfulness and kindness,<br>\nChris, will always be<br>\nremembered by me, mate.<br>\nWhat comes after death I can<br>\nHope, as I pray we meet again\"\n\nAll the murder victims had been strangled, although there was a strong suspicion that the last of them, Lamb, had been alive when buried.\n\nCriminologist Professor Paul Wilson has suggested that had Worrell not been killed, the Truro murders may have become a much more devastating killing spree, as Worrell was following the \"established behaviour of some serial killers\" with the time between murders getting shorter. Miller himself told Worrell's girlfriend before his arrest that, \"It was getting worse lately. It was happening more often. It was perhaps a good thing that Chris died\".\n\nMiller stood trial for the murders, and was found guilty of six of the seven murders (with the exception of the first murder, Veronica Knight) on 12 March 1980. Unusually, he was convicted of murder despite having never touched a victim; he was sentenced to the maximum six consecutive terms of life imprisonment.\n\nThe testimony at his trial revealed a terrifying story. Miller and Worrell would cruise the city streets every night in Worrell's 1969 blue-and-white Chrysler Valiant, looking for women that Worrell could have sex with. Worrell was 23, charismatic and good-looking, so Worrell had no trouble in regularly \"picking up\" local girls for casual sex. Miller would drive Worrell and the woman to a secluded place, where Worrell would have sex with the women, often after tying them up, while Miller waited outside the car. Miller would then drive them back into town and drop them off.\n\nMiller described how the \"pick-ups\" became more and more terrifying. First, Worrell started occasionally raping the women who refused his advances. Then he started murdering them. Miller was unaware that murder would occur prior to it happening; he stated that it only happened some times and not others. It appeared that as the violence increased, Miller became increasingly fearful of Worrell.\n\nMiller maintained, \"They can give me life for knowing about the murders and not reporting them. But they charged me with murder ... It's a load of bullshit\". Following the trial one of the jurors hired a lawyer to petition the Attorney-General for a retrial. South Australian Chief Justice Len King agreed that Miller should be granted another hearing on the grounds that the judge at his trial, Mr Justice Matheson, had instructed the jury to find Miller guilty of murder. However, the Attorney-General, Chris Sumner, refused to grant a retrial.\n\nLegally, Miller argued that he never engaged in any murders directly, nor did he explicitly agree prior to going out cruising for women that he would support Worrell in the murders. Nevertheless, he was found guilty of murder because he was found to be a part of a joint criminal enterprise. He was present at the crime scenes and assisted in disposing of the bodies. This created subsequent legal difficulties over the definition of a joint criminal enterprise, but these have largely been resolved on the basis that this was a special—and particularly horrifying—case.\n\nIn 1999, Miller applied to have a non-parole period set under new laws, and on 8 February 2000, Chief Justice John Doyle granted a non-parole period of 35 years, making Miller eligible for parole in 2014.\n\nOn 21 October 2008, at the age of 68, Miller died of liver failure, as a complication of having hepatitis C. He also suffered from prostate cancer and lung cancer. At that point he was one of the longest-serving prisoners in the state.\n\n\n"}

It elected one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the first past the post method of election. Also, however, it was one of eight constituencies in the Highlands and Islands electoral region, which elects seven additional members, in addition to eight constituency MSPs, to produce a form of proportional representation for the region as a whole.\n\nFor the Scottish Parliament election, 2011, Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross was redrawn and included as part of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross, along with part of Ross, Skye and Inverness West.\n\nThe other seven constituencies of the Highlands and Islands electoral region during the constituency's existence were Argyll and Bute, Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber, Moray, Orkney, Ross, Skye and Inverness West, Shetland and the Western Isles.\n\nThe region covers most of Argyll and Bute council area, all of the Highland council area, most of the Moray council area, all of the Orkney council area, all of the Shetland council area and all of Na h-Eileanan Siar.\n\nThe constituency was created at the same time as the Scottish Parliament, in 1999, with the name and boundaries of a pre-existing Westminster (House of Commons) constituency. In 2005, however, Scottish Westminster constituencies were generally replaced with new larger constituencies. The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross Westminster constituency was enlarged slightly, to cover an area also covered by the Ross, Skye and Inverness West Holyrood constituency.\n\n\"See Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions from 2011 \"\n\nFollowing their First Periodic review into constituencies to the Scottish Parliament, the Boundary Commission for Scotland formed a newly drawn seat to succeed Caithness, Sutherland, and Easter Ross in time for the 2011 election. The new constituency also includes part of the Ross, Skye and Inverness West constituency, and is known as Caithness, Sutherland, and Ross.\n\nCaithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross was the most northerly of three constituencies covering the Highland council area. The other two were Ross, Skye and Inverness West and Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber. All three were within the Highlands and Islands electoral region. Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross has Ross, Skye and Inverness West on its southern boundary. Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber is further south.\n\nWhen created in 1999 the constituency boundaries were definable with reference to council wards, which were grouped by the Highland Council in relation to eight council management areas. Constituency and management area names have many elements in common, and the management areas had the boundaries of former districts of the Highland region, as abolished in 1996, namely Caithness, Sutherland, Ross and Cromarty, Skye and Lochalsh, Inverness, Nairn, Lochaber and Badenoch and Strathspey.\n\nThe management areas were abolished in 2007, and the council introduced three new corporate management areas, defined as groups of new wards. The boundaries of the corporate management areas are similar to those of Westminster constituencies created in 2005. One corporate management area, the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross area, has boundaries, therefore, which are also similar to those of a Holyrood constituency. The boundaries of the other two corporate areas, the Ross, Skye and Lochaber area and the Inverness, Nairn, and Badenoch and Strathspey area, are quite unlike those of any Holyrood constituency.\n\n \n"}

The event is held in April and celebrates the blooming of the dogwood trees. It includes a parade, a house and garden show, and demonstrations of various Appalachian arts and crafts such as quilting, bluegrass music, and doll-making. Many events are held in Market Square in downtown Knoxville. Additionally, driving trails are marked in Knoxville and the surrounding area for people to view the dogwoods in bloom.\n\nThe initial impetus for the dogwood festival came from a description of Knoxville by John Gunther in his 1947 book \"Inside U.S.A.\" In that best-selling book, Gunther characterized Knoxville as the \"ugliest city\" in the United States, with what he called \"an intense, concentrated, degrading ugliness.\" Other visitors to the city had also commented negatively on the city's appearance. In reaction to the insulting characterization of the city, Knoxville civic leaders started a community beautification campaign. Beautification efforts began with yard and neighborhood cleanups. In 1955, the first dogwood trail was designated in Sequoyah Hills. A second trail followed in Holston Hills in 1956, and additional trails were designated in 1957 in Fountain City and the Lake Forest neighborhood. In 1959, \"Knoxville News Sentinel\" columnist Carson Brewer proposed a dogwood festival, pointing to the successful ramp festival in Cosby, Tennessee, as a model for the potential success of a festival in Knoxville. The city's chamber of commerce and Junior League embraced the idea and contributed $20,000 each to make it a reality, leading to the first annual festival in 1961.\n\nIn 1995, journalist Paul Harvey praised the city's beauty during the festival, saying \"there’s something about Knoxville that makes dogwood trees grow taller\" and describing the dogwoods lining residential streets as \"resplendent by day and moonlighted by night.\" Calling the city \"a springtime blizzard of blossoms of dogwood\", he noted the presence of other flowers, including violets, iris, May apples, lilacs, narcissus, and flowering fruit trees. He said that the festival attracted a quarter-million visitors each year.\n\n"}

This catalog supplements a revision of George O. Abell's original \"Northern Survey\" of 1958, which had only 2,712 clusters, with a further 1,361 clustersthe \"Southern Survey\" of 1989, published after Abell's death by co-authors Harold G. Corwin and Ronald P. Olowin from those parts of the south celestial hemisphere that had been omitted from the earlier survey.\n\nThe Abell catalog, and especially its clusters, are of interest to amateur astronomers as challenge objects to be viewed in dark locations on large aperture amateur telescopes.\nThe original catalog of 2,712 rich clusters of galaxies was published in 1958 by George O. Abell (1927–1983), who was then studying at the California Institute of Technology. The catalog, which formed part of Abell's PhD thesis, was prepared by means of a visual inspection of the red 103a-E plates of the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS), for which Abell was one of the principal observers. A. G. Wilson, another of the principal observers, assisted Abell in the initial stages of the survey by routinely inspecting the plates as they were produced. After the completion of the survey, Abell went over the plates again and carried out a more detailed inspection. In both cases inspection was made with a 3.5× magnifying lens.\n\nTo qualify for inclusion in the catalog, a cluster had to satisfy four criteria:\n\n\nIn the catalog as originally published the clusters were listed in increasing order of right ascension. Equatorial coordinates (right ascension and declination) were given for the equinox of 1855 (the epoch of the Bonner Durchmusterung) and galactic coordinates for 1900.\n\nAlso listed for each cluster were the following:\n\n\nThe sky-coverage of the 1958 catalog was limited to declinations north of –27°, the original southern limit of POSS. To rectify this and other shortcomings, the original catalog was later revised and supplemented with an additional catalogthe \"Southern Survey\"of rich galaxy clusters from those parts of the south celestial hemisphere that had been omitted from the original catalog.\n\nThe Southern Survey added a further 1,361 rich clusters to Abell's original Northern Survey. The deep IIIa-J plates of the Southern Sky Survey (SSS) were used in the survey. These photographic plates were taken with the United Kingdom's 1.2-metre Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia, in the 1970s. Abell began the survey during a sabbatical year in Edinburgh in 1976. There he enlisted the assistance of Harold G Corwin of the University of Edinburgh, who continued to work on the catalog until 1981, at which time he joined the Department of Astronomy at the University of Texas. By then about half the survey had been completed. An interim paper on the Southern Survey was read at a symposium in 1983, about one month before Abell's death; the catalog was completed by Ronald P Olowin of the University of Oklahoma, and published in 1989.\n\nAbell and Corwin worked from original plates stored at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh, scanning the plates visually with a 3x wide-angle magnifier; Olowin used high-quality film copies, which he scanned both visually with a 7x magnifying lens and automatically with a backlit digitizer.\n\nThe criteria for inclusion in Abell's Northern Survey were retained, as were Abell's \"richness\" and \"distance\" classificationsbut with the distance classes now being defined in terms of redshift rather than magnitude. As before, clusters were included if they had at least thirty bright galaxies, as it was estimated that this would all but eliminate the possibility of genuinely rich clusters (i.e. clusters with at least fifty bright members) being omitted. The Southern Survey retains the system of designation devised by Abell for his original catalog, with the numbers running from 2713 to 4076. (The catalog contains three duplicate entries: A3208 = A3207, A3833 = A3832, and A3897 = A2462.) The equatorial co-ordinates are for the equinoxes 1950 and 2000, while the galactic co-ordinates are calculated from the 1950 equatorial co-ordinates.\n\nAbell's original catalogrevised, corrected and updatedwas included in the 1989 paper, as was the Abell Supplement, a supplementary catalog of 1,174 clusters from the Southern Survey which were not rich enough or were too distant to be included in the main catalog.\n\nThe standard format used to refer to Abell clusters is: Abell X, where . E.g. Abell 1656.\n\nAlternative formats include: ABCG 1656; AC 1656; ACO 1656; A 1656, and A1656. Abell himself preferred the latter, but in recent years ACO 1656 has become the preferred format among professional astronomers and is the one recommended by the \"Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg\" (see SIMBAD).\n\nSome notable members of Abell's catalog include:\n\n\nAbout 10% of Abell clusters at redshift z < 0.1 are not genuine rich clusters but, rather, the result of the superposition of sparser groupings. The extremely large and extremely rich Virgo Cluster was excluded from the Abell catalog because it covered too large an area of the sky to appear on a single photographic plate.\n\n\n"}

Previous to that there were no restrictions. A bill introduced in 2014 aimed to impose up to 20 years imprisonment for consensual same-sex acts (proposed Article 361bis). However, on 12 December 2016, the National Assembly passed an updated penal code criminalising both male and female same-sex sexual activity by a vote of 111 to 1 (with 4 abstentions), but classing acts between consenting adults as a misdemeanour offence. On 8 May 2017, the new penal code was enacted by the President Idriss Deby.\n\nIn supporting the law, the former Prime Minister Delwa Kassiré Coumakoye argued a religious motivation: \"\"Homosexuality is condemned by all religions. We do not have to forgive something that God himself rejects because Westerners have said this or that.\"\" His comment was criticized by some LGBT historians who controversially maintain that homophobia was brought to Chad by colonialism, despite the existence of Islamic law in the nation prior to imperial rule. These historians believe that homosexuality was quite commonplace and accepted before the arrival of the Europeans. The US-based Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights called on the President of Chad not to enact the changes to the law, which is linked to a rise in homophobia in Africa in response to the increased visibility and assertiveness of gay lifestyles and politics in Africa, and the engagement of fundamentalist christians.

The angular houses of the horoscope are considered to be the most ardent, or forceful, and are considered to have the greatest impact in the chart. The influential 17th-century astrologer William Lilly states simply: \"Planets in angles do more forcibly show their effects.\" Angular houses rule those critical things in our life, such as our appearance and how we behave, our family life, our married life or partnerships, and our career.\n\nThe first house, of which the cusp is often (but not always) the Ascendant, signifies the person in the chart, his or her personality, and his or her behaviour. Quite often, the Ascendant can overshadow a person's Sun sign. For example, a person who has Leo on the cusp of his or her first house and Virgo as his or her Sun sign can be quite dynamic and dramatic, but the fastidious, efficient, self-effacing part of him- or herself will not be readily apparent until people are able to pierce through the persona and see the real person.\n\nThe fourth house, of which the cusp is often (but not always) the Imum Coeli, signifies a person's home, security, family, and those things in early life that served as a foundation for them. Sometimes the fourth house also is connected with endings, such as a person's end of life. This house is affiliated often with our parents. For the ancients, it was the House of the Mother, but in modern charts, it tends to have a more general parental significance.\n\nThe seventh house, of which the cusp is often (but not always) the Descendant, shows the type of mate the native is likely to be attracted to and all partnerships in general. For Hellenistic astrologers, the seventh house was in general a fortunate one, especially for benefics, but there are some difficulties which may arise from these placements because the house is \"the Setting Place\" or the place where the Sun falls.\n\nThe tenth house, of which the cusp is often (but not always) the Midheaven, refers to our careers, vocations, creative output, and how we would like the world to see us. For Ptolemy, it also was the house where our children's impact can be seen.\n\n"}

Both male and female same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Morocco.\n\nArticle 489 of the Penal Code of Morocco criminalises \"lewd or unnatural acts with an individual of the same sex\". Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Morocco and can be punished with anything from six months to three years' imprisonment and a fine of 120 to 1,200 dirhams. The Moroccan government uses the law as a way to police members of the LGBT+ community. When one is arrested in Morocco for a suspected homosexual act, their name becomes publicized outing the individual regardless as to whether they are homosexual or not. However, the law is sporadically enforced by the authorities, with a degree of tolerance extended to homosexuality in the holiday resorts like Marrakesh. The legal status of LGBT people living in Morocco stems largely from traditional Islamic morality, which views homosexuality and cross dressing as signs of immorality.\n\nIn 2016, two girls were arrested in Marrakesh after one's cousin took a photo of them kissing. This sparked international outcry and the use of the hashtag #freethegirls. Their case was postponed until December 2016. In early December 2016, the two girls were acquitted.\n\nIn May 2019, in the evaluation by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the partnership with the Moroccan Parliament in the framework of the Partnership for Democracy Status, the parliamentary assembly called the Moroccan Parliament to stop enforcing the \"criminal law provisions criminalising homosexual relations or relations between two persons of the opposite-sex do not have a marriage union.\" until its repeal.\n\nNone of the major or minor political parties have made public statements in favor of LGBT-rights and no LGBT rights legislation has been enacted. Government attitudes towards homosexuality tend to be in the interests of the protection of the tradition of the country, in keeping with the culture's traditional gender roles and religious mores. It has banned books on homosexuality and required schools to teach a curriculum that \"emphasises...the danger and depravity of \"unnatural acts\". Moreover, on 21 March 2008, a statement issued by the Ministry of Interior revealed the full and wide scope of the government's agenda: to \"preserve citizens' ethics and defend our society against all irresponsible actions that mar our identity and culture\".\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, the government opposed the participation of an International Gay and Lesbian Rights Representative at the 2001 United Nations Conference on AIDS-HIV. They also opposed a United Nations joint statement condemning violence against LGBT people.\n\nThere is no legal recognition of same-sex couples.\n\nThere is no law against discrimination or harassment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in Morocco.\n\nTraditional cultural and religious mores tend to associate cross-dressing with homosexuality. Culturally, certain forms of cross-dressing have been tolerated in areas where women were not a part. The initial lack of female actors meant that the roles often went to men, who were generally assumed to be homosexual, but were shown a modicum of tolerance.\n\nIn the 1950s, the publicity surrounding Coccinelle helped to establish Casablanca as being a place where certain doctors were willing to perform sex change operations, albeit in clandestine circumstances.\n\nToday, it is unclear whether this reputation still exists or what the current government policy is for transgender people. A Moroccan transgender woman named Randa did reportedly publish a book, although little is known about its contents or commercial success.\n\nMoroccan public opinion towards the LGBT community is generally negative, in alignment with attitudes about LGBT rights in much of the Muslim world. The country has a male-dominated culture, a patriarchial society with traditional gender roles, that prefers a male and a female to get married and have children. The government has continued to enforce the laws on homosexuality with several public arrests in a laid back fashion, although the laws are only enforced sporadically nonetheless. \n\nA court in Ksar el-Kebir, a small city about 120 kilometres south of Tangier, convicted six men on 10 December 2007 of violating article 489 of Morocco’s penal code. However, according to the defendants' lawyers, the prosecution failed to present any evidence that the men actually had engaged in the prohibited conduct.\n\nThe men were sentenced to varying terms on 17 December 2007, after a video circulated online—including on YouTube—purporting to show a private party, allegedly including the men, taking place in Ksar el-Kebir on 18 November. Press reports claimed the party was a \"gay marriage.\" Following the arrests, dozens of men and women marched through the streets of Ksar el-Kebir, denouncing the men's alleged actions and calling for their punishment.\n\nIn 2010, the government permitted openly gay singer Elton John to give a performance during the Mawazine Festival, despite objections from the Justice and Development Party, which was, at the time, the biggest opposition party in parliament. The festival was condoned by King Mohammed VI and was a part of the king's plans to create a more open and modern nation.\n\nAbdellah Taïa and Rachid O., both successful writers, have written openly about gender roles and sexual identity in Morocco, but they do not reside in Morocco. Beyond these writers, the government has tolerated the existence of one magazine for the gay community as well as one gay rights organization.\n\nThe LGBT publication \"Mithly\" has been allowed to be discreetly distributed to adults in Morocco, although the government still will not grant the publication a distribution license and the magazine itself has to be made in neighboring Spain. In a similar sense, the government will not officially recognize the LGBT rights organization, Kif-Kif, but has allowed it to exist and co-sponsor some educational seminars.\n\nIn 2017, following the Universal Periodic Review in Geneva, Mustafa Ramid, former Minister of Justice and Liberties in Abdelilah Benkirane's and Saadeddine Othmani's governments has called homosexuals “trash” in an interview. This was criticised by local human rights associations which together signed a petition addressed to the Prime Minister of Morocco Othmani to open an investigation with Minister Ramid “on his discriminatory and unconstitutional statements towards sexual minorities.”\n\nKif-Kif is the only organization to advocate on behalf of the LGBT community in Morocco and publishes the \"Mithly\" magazine in Spain. Established in 2004, it has not been given legal recognition by the Department of the Interior, but it has been unofficially permitted to organize certain educational seminars.\nHajar Moutaouakil, a young Moroccan lesbian, posted a video on YouTube on human rights day calling for love and tolerance, but the video created controversy. She later posted her biography online.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Jonathan Boucher (pronounced Boo-Shay), FRSE, FSA (12 March 1738 – 27 April 1804) was an English clergyman, teacher, preacher and philologist.\n\nJohn Boucher was born in Blencogo, near Wigton, Cumberland, and educated at the Wigton Grammar School. After training in Workington, Jonathan became a teacher, at St. Bees School and in 1759 went to Virginia, where he became a private tutor in the families of Virginia planters. Invited to become vicar of a nearby Anglican church, but lacking any religious qualifications, he briefly returned to England, to be ordained by the bishop of London in March 1762. He also carried a cane around the colony.\n\nHe landed in America again on 12 July, was associated with the Anglican Church, and remained until 1775 as rector of various Virginia and Maryland parishes, including St. Mary's, Caroline County, Virginia, Hanover, King George County, Virginia, and St Anne's in Annapolis, Maryland and in 1771, St. Barnabas Church, Upper Marlboro, Maryland.\n\nHe also kept a school, and among his charges, from 1768, was John Parke Custis, the stepson of George Washington with whom he began a close friendship. Earlier, on Whitsun Monday, 1766, he baptised 350 Black adults at his Caroline County parish, and preached to about 3,000 for about an hour.\n\nHe was widely known as an eloquent preacher, and his scholarly attainments won for him the friendship and esteem of some of the ablest scholars in the colonies. He was also an ardent Tory, believing firmly that protest against Government wrongs should be carried out within the law– but definitely not an uncritical supporter of British policy; for example, he considered the 1765 Stamp Act to be \"oppressive, impolitic and illegal\", and the Royal proclamation against the Westward Expansion of the thirteen colonies \"unjust and impolitic\". During his residence in Maryland he vigorously opposed the vestry act, by which the powers and emoluments of the Maryland pastors were greatly diminished. When the struggle between the colonies and the mother country began, although he felt much sympathy for the former, his opposition to any form of illegal obstruction to the Stamp Act and other measures, and his denunciation of a resort to force, created a breach between him and his parish, and for months, he preached with a pair of loaded pistols beside him. In a fiery farewell sermon at St. Barnabas in 1775, to a hostile crowd of 200 men, he preached after the opening of hostilities he stated:\n\nI will continue to pray for the King; and all who are in authority under him ... As long as I live ... will I ... proclaim: God save the King [bold added]\n\nAt the conclusion and with pistol in hand, he seized the leader of the crowd, Osborn Sprigg of Northampton, Maryland, and together they walked to Boucher's horse. Both men were allowed to leave without harm.\n\nWith George Washington forced to make a hard choice between protecting his argumentative friend and showing loyalty to the colonists' cause, in the autumn of 1775 Boucher returned to England with his wife, Eleanor Addison of Oxon Hill, Maryland, where his loyalism was rewarded by a government pension.\n\nIn 1784 he became vicar of Epsom in Surrey, where he continued until his death on 27 April 1804, becoming known as one of the most eloquent preachers of his day.\n\nIn 1804, shortly before his death, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh but his link to Edinburgh is unclear.\n\nBoucher was an accomplished writer and scholar, contributed largely to William Hutchinson's \"History of the County of Cumberland\" (2 vols., 1794 seq.), and published \"A View of the Causes and Consequences of the American Revolution\" (1797), dedicated to General George Washington, and consisting of thirteen discourses delivered in America between 1763 and 1775. His philological studies, to which the last fourteen years of his life were devoted, resulted in the compilation of \"A Glossary of Provincial and Archaic Words\", intended as a supplement to Samuel Johnson's \"Dictionary\", but never published except in part, which finally in 1831 passed into the hands of the English compilers of Webster's Dictionary, by whom it was used. His \"Reminiscences of an American Loyalist\" were also belatedly publisher, first in serial form in \"Notes and Queries\" in the 1870s.\n\nHe married three times: First, in America, in 1772 to Eleanor Addison of which little is known, other than his wife did not appear to return to Britain with him and that they had a daughter named Eleanor Boucher. Second, in England in 1787, to Mary Elizabeth Foreman who died the following year. Third, in 1789, to Elizabeth James (née Hodgson), a widow to Dr. John James. James and Boucher had seven children together, including Barton Boucher.\n\nHis son, Barton Boucher (1794–1864), rector of Fonthill Bishop, Wiltshire, in 1856, was well known as the author of religious tracts, hymns and novels, whilst his daughter Eleanor married Edward Hawke Locker, Civil Commissioner of the Greenwich Hospital.\n"}

The hypocentre was at a shallow depth of 8 km. The epicentre was south-south-east of the town of Matata, and north-north-west of Edgecumbe, on the Rangitaiki Plains (the floodplain of the Rangitaiki River, the Tarawera River and the Whakatane River). It was the most damaging earthquake New Zealand had experienced since the 1968 Inangahua earthquake.\n\nThe main shock was preceded for two weeks by earthquake swarms in two areas of the Bay of Plenty. A swarm started on 21 February off-shore from Maketu, near Te Puke, 40 kilometres from the main shock's epicentre, and another swarm started on 26 February between Matata and Thornton, very close to the epicentre. Then there was a 5.2 earthquake at 1:35 pm on 2 March, followed by the main shock seven minutes later. The main shock appears to have actually consisted of two ruptures, and possibly a third. There were indications that the first rupture propagated towards the south-west, triggering a second rupture 9 kilometres to the south-west and three seconds after the first. There is also the possibility of a third, significantly smaller, rupture another ten seconds later. The largest aftershock measured 5.6 and struck nine minutes later at 1.51 pm.\n\nEleven ground-surface ruptures occurred in the Rangitaiki Plains, though no active faults had previously been recognised on the Plains. The largest rupture, the Edgecumbe Fault, was long and formed on, and extended, a late Holocene fault scarp. The old scarp had previously been unrecognised, but was later seen in aerial photographs taken before the earthquake. The northern end of the scarp is one kilometre east of Edgecumbe, and the scarp runs southwest to a point three kilometres north of Te Teko. The land on the north-western side dropped by up to , and that area is now more prone to flooding. The most spectacular feature of the scarp was a deep prominent fissure up to 3 metres wide and 3–4 metres deep, mostly with near-vertical walls, that opened up along the fault. It appears that the fault has ruptured at least once previously in the past 1800 years. The intense ground shaking led to a large number of ground surface failures, including sand boils, ridge-top shatters and debris avalanches on steeper slopes.\n\nThe Rangitaiki Plains lie within the Taupo Volcanic Zone, which is widening. During the Edgecumbe earthquake, the area widened by 1.2 metres.\n\nThe most damage was in the towns of Edgecumbe, Te Teko, Kawerau, Matata and Thornton, where chimneys toppled and poorly constructed houses were seriously damaged. The hardest hit was Edgecumbe, with damage to approximately 50% of its houses. There was extensive damage to its milk factory, with large storage tanks toppled. Railway tracks in the town were bent and buckled, and an 80-tonne New Zealand Railways DC class locomotive toppled over.\n\nTwenty-five people suffered injuries that needed medical attention, but no-one was killed. The foreshock seven minutes before the main shock had cut the power supply, and many people had moved away from heavy machinery and out of buildings that then collapsed in the main earthquake.\n\n"}

This species is most notable for the workers’ complex and extreme predatory behavior, which involves a symbiosis with both a plant and fungal species.\nThey live in leaf pockets of a host plant species, \"Hirtella physophora\". These leaf pockets are areas inside of the plant between the leaves and the stem. Each colony, which consists of about 1,200 workers, inhabits a single tree; however, the ants are spread among the leaf pockets, with typically 40 workers per pocket. Their diet primarily consists of large insects that are captured on the plant, but they also eat some kinds of food bodies produced by the plant as well as its nectar. They are able to capture their prey, which is much larger than themselves, by constructing a platform that acts as a trap for the unsuspecting prey. The ants hide in the trap and attack when any insect lands on it. This technique is an example of ambush predation.\n\nThe worker is about 2 mm long, with a head width and length at about .6 mm. The queen is approximately double that size, with a head width of 1.05 mm, head length of .98 mm, and a total length of 5.53 mm. The workers have 10-segmented antennae, from where they get their name. They also have abundant hair, with long hairs on their head (greater than .13 mm) and shorter hairs on their abdomen (less than .07 mm). They have brownish yellow colored bodies and whitish hair.\n\n\"A. decemarticulatus\" is a Neotropical species that lives in the Amazonian tropics of South America. The species lives in \"H. physophora\", whose range is limited to Brazil and French Guiana. They live and hunt on \"H. physophora\", living in leaf pouches and patrolling the plant’s stem for prey.\n\nThe relationship between \"A. decemarticulatus\" and \"H. physophora\" is very specialized. \"H. physophora\" is a small tree in the Amazonian rainforest that resides in the undergrowth. It is also an example of a myrmecophyte, because it contains ant-domatia, leaf pouches and hollow chambers where the ants nest permanently. These leaf pouches occur when the edge of a leaf adjacent to the petiole curls under. The result is two hollow spheres on both sides of the stem of the leaf. The ants live inside of these domatia. There is only one colony per tree, but that colony divides up into many different domatia. Also located in the leaf pouches are extrafloral nectaries, which provide the ants with nectar made by the plant, and also some food bodies that provide the ants with further nutrition as they mature to become foragers and insect predators. This is the first known instance of extrafloral nectaries being observed inside of ant-domatia.\n\nSo far this looks like simple parasitism by the ants, as if they simply take advantage of the plant for food and shelter. However, the plant also benefits greatly from this relationship. With the help of their traps and predation, the ants defend the plant from other insects and parasitic plants. Any insect that may kill or eat the plant is quickly captured and killed by the ants, which is also to their own benefit.\n\nThe specialized structures of the plant reveal a very interesting coevolution and symbiosis between these two species. A recent study performed by Céline Leroy et al. (2008) revealed many characteristics that the plant has adapted to support the ants. First, the domatia are located next to the stems that the ants use for hunting. Second, they contain extrafloral nectaries and food bodies to feed the ants if they do not have other sources of food. Third, there are less chloroplasts found inside of the domatia, which means that it has a lower photosynthetic capacity. Fourth, stomata were found inside of the domatia, although at a lower density, possibly to capture the carbon dioxide from the ants’ respiration taking place inside. Finally, there was a greater deposit of cellulose found in the domatia, which would result in a thicker cell wall and a more rigid surface to support the weight of the ants. These findings show that the areas destined to become domatia are inherited and a result of coevolution; they were solely produced to support this specific species of ant.\n\nThere are many different species of fungus that grow alongside the domatia where the ants live. In fact, when the founding queen first starts laying eggs in the domatia of a new \"H. physophora\", the hyphae of multiple different species of fungi will entirely cover the entrance to the domatia. When the worker ants mature, they actually have to dig their way through the fungal covering to get to the outside of the plant. However, almost even more remarkably, out of all of these fungal species, \"A. decemarticulatus\" will only cultivate one specific species. This fungus is a sooty mold which, according to one study by Mario X. Ruiz-Gonzalez et al. (2010), is characterized by closely related haplotypes (genetic markers) in the order Chaetothyriales. The ants use this mold to construct their traps.\n\nAnother noteworthy observation is that, unlike typical mutualisms between ants and fungus, these ants do not receive any nutrition from the fungus. They strictly manipulate the physiology of the fungus to construct a mortar for a trap that is able to catch much larger prey.\n\nManufacturing this trap is an incredible act in itself. The workers construct the traps on the stems of the plant, basically by making a raised and hollow platform on one section of the stem. The structure itself simply looks like a part of the plant, as if it grew in width slightly. The ants will also make small holes in this platform which are slightly wider than their own bodies. The individual workers will hide in these holes underneath the surface, invisible to their prey from the outside. They will position their heads outwards from the plant with mandibles open, waiting for prey.\n\nThe actual production of the trap occurs by first cutting plant hairs (trichomes) from a narrow vertical stretch of the stem outside of the domatia. The ants will then arrange these hairs to outline the structure of the trap and regurgitate the mold that acts as a paste and holds the trichomes together. They use their fungal relationship to gather this mold, by collecting the mycelium from the fungus grown on the plant. This mold will continue to grow in between the trichomes and around the holes to fill out and reinforce the structure.\n\nNormally, there are only a small number of ants in any given area on the plant stem. There are about 40 workers per leaf, but generally only a few will be patrolling outside. Once an insect lands on the plant, the closest ant will immediately surface and grab on to a leg, antenna, wing, or some other appendage of the prey. This ant will pull the prey, which will try to escape by pulling in the opposite direction. However, the ant will rarely let go of its grip. The ant immobilizes the prey and, using an extreme feat of strength, will hold the much larger prey to the plant as more ants from around that area arrive. This ability to hold the prey is extremely important because the ants move and congregate fairly slowly.\n\nAfter the first ant has immobilized the prey, it releases pheromones to call other ants to the area. The first few ants to arrive will each grab a different leg and pull in opposite directions, \"spread-eagling\" the prey. This is basically identical to the medieval torture tactic of \"rack torture\". Anywhere between six and 16 ants will participate in this spread-eagling. As the prey lies motionless and helpless, worker ants will congregate and either help to hold the prey down, if that is necessary, or start stinging and biting it. In doing this, they use a venom that they produce to paralyze and kill the prey. Afterwards, the group of workers will carry the body back to the colony, where it is dismembered and cut up into little pieces to be eaten by the group.\n\nThis amazingly gruesome predatory behavior is a great example of a collaboration between solitary and cooperative predation. The first ant will initially act alone in her predation, but after that other ants will come and join in the hunt, and still other will travel back to the domatia to recruit even more ants to aid in holding down and eventually dismembering the prey. This also demonstrates how much more effective a group of individuals can be than an individual working on its own. A single ant would never be able to kill such large prey; they are only able to do so by incorporating communication and cooperation.\n\nThis predatory behavior is very effective against the relatively large prey that the ants consume. Dejean and other researchers (2001) tested the limits of its effectiveness by exposing the ants to termites and grasshoppers, which are about 40 and 142.2 times the size of the worker ants, respectively. So a single \"Allomerus decemarticulatus\" worker restraining a grasshopper is about the equivalence of a 175-pound person holding down a struggling 25,000 pound object that is actively trying to escape. When the termites were exposed, each was captured by the ants; none got away. However, with grasshoppers, all were seized by at least one leg, but out of the 20 introduced, five were captured completely, 12 escaped but lost their leg that was clasped on to by the worker, and seven jumped away.\n\nAny prey that has the ability to jump or fly away will always be more effective in escaping than non-flying insects like the termites. However, many times those that do escape will still lose a leg or other appendage in the process, like 60% of the grasshoppers in this experiment. Because the prey is so much larger than the ants, even just getting this one appendage as a food source is a victory. For example, a hind leg of a grasshopper is still about 12.4 times the size of a single ant and a great resource in itself.\n\nIf the multiple relationships of \"A. decemarticulatus\" were not complex enough, they also commonly interact with an assassin bug, \"Zelus annulosus\", which often resides on \"H. physophora\" plants. However, these bugs have adapted physiological and behavioral characteristics that allow them to avoid the predation of \"A. decemarticulatus\", while also maintaining a mutualistic relationship with the plant.\n\nSimilar to the ants, \"Z. annulosus\" normally lives on younger \"H. physophora\" individuals, where the females lay eggs on the stem. As they begin to develop, the young bugs will live among the trichomes of the stem and hunt on the leaves of the plant. The relationship between the assassin bug and the plant acts independently from that between the ants and the plant. One difference between the two relationships, however, is that the assassin bugs do not take any food source from the plant like the ants do.\n\n\"Z. annulosus\" has basically adapted to live and hunt around \"A. decemarticulatus\". The assassin bug species uses this particular plant to raise their nymphs because the trichomes of the plant deter larger ant species that may kill the young developing bugs. Also, the bugs secrete a sticky substance that allows them to walk on top of these trichomes, thus avoiding the traps of \"A. decemarticulatus\". So in the relationship between \"Z. annulosus\" and \"H. physophora\", the bug receives shelter from potential large predator ants, and the plant received a second line of defense against herbivores. The assassin bug also cohabitates the plant peacefully with the ants. They hunt in similar areas on the plant, but the assassin bugs are suspected to actively avoid any of the ants because they are much quicker than the ants.\n\nBy simply observing the stem of one \"H. physophora\" individual, we see the complex interactions between four different species: an ant, a plant, a fungus, and an assassin bug, as well as all of the prey that lands on the plant. The plant gives a little of its own resources to the predators, but it gets two forms of defense against herbivores and parasitic plants. To the plant, this defense is worth much more than the loss of some food. The plant has maximized its own fitness by establishing two separate and independent relationships that are not very costly but very rewarding. The insects both benefit as well, given a safe habitat and a steady food supply of other insects that land on the prey. In the perspective of \"A. decemarticulatus\", they do not actively give any of their own resources to the plant or to the assassin bug. They simply live among them, use their resources, and hunt.\n\nIn regards to the predatory behavior of \"A. decemarticulatus\", similar behaviors have been observed in other ant species, such as symbioses with plants (like in \"Pseudomyrmex ferruginea\"), cultivating a fungus (like in leafcutter ants), and sneaking up to and ambushing larger prey (like in \"Azteca andreae\", another species studied by Dejean). However, most remarkably, \"Allomerus decemarticulatus\" seems to incorporate each of these advanced behaviors to make a powerful apparatus for tricking impressively large prey.\n\n"}

{"id": "1799513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799513", "title": "LGBT rights in Serbia", "text": "LGBT rights in Serbia\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Serbia face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in Serbia, and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in areas such as employment, education, media, and the provision of goods and services, amongst others, is banned. Nevertheless, households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples.\n\nIn May 2014, Amnesty International identified Serbia as one of a number of countries where there is a marked lack of will to tackle homophobia and transphobia, noting that public authorities had repeatedly banned pride marches on the basis of violent threats from homophobic groups and had failed to protect LGBT individuals and organizations from discrimination, including verbal and social media threats and physical attacks. A pride parade successfully took place in September 2014 in Belgrade. Since then, successful pride parades have been held every year, with local mayors and some government ministers regularly attending. In 2016, the association ILGA-Europe ranked Serbia 28th in terms of LGBT rights out of 49 observed European countries.\n\nIn June 2017, Ana Brnabić became the Prime Minister of Serbia, as the first woman and first openly gay person to hold the office, and the second female LGBT head of government overall (after Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir of Iceland). She was also the first Serbian Prime Minister to attend a pride parade.\n\nAlthough religious laws existed prohibiting same-sex love and relationships, expressions were common in both Orthodox Christian and Islamic society. The primary expression of same-sex love for Orthodox Christians were brotherhood unions known as \"Pobratimstvo\" (Adelphopoiesis). The early nineteenth century saw a time of relative turmoil for Serbia, with sporadic periods of stability. In 1804, Serbia gained its autonomy from the Ottoman Empire following two uprisings. Karađorđe's Criminal Code (\"Карађорђев криминални законик\") was subsequently promulgated by the Serbian Jurisprudential Council (\"\") sometime in late spring or early summer 1807, and remained in force until 7 October 1813, when the Ottoman Empire re-gained control of Serbia. The Code penalised certain issues related to marital life and sexuality (such as forced marriage, rape, separation/divorce without the approval of a clerical court, and infanticide). It did not, however, mention same-sex sexual activity; and so homosexuality became effectively legal for a period of six years.\n\nIn 1858, the Ottoman Empire, of which Serbia was nominally a vassal, legalized same-sex sexual intercourse.\n\nHowever, the progressive reforms introduced by Prince Alexander Karađorđević and Prince Mihailo were overturned when Miloš Obrenović returned to power. In the first post-medieval Criminal Code of the Principality of Serbia, named \"Kaznitelni zakon\" (Law of Penalties), adopted in 1860, sexual intercourse \"against the order of nature\" between males became punishable by 6 months to 4 years imprisonment. Like in many other countries' legal documents of the time, lesbian sexuality was ignored and not mentioned.\n\nIn 1918, Serbia became a part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. At first, the new state effectively inherited the different laws that applied to the different territories that joined together (often contradictory). Eventually, the new Yugoslav Criminal Code of 1929 banned \"lewdness against the order of nature\" (anal intercourse) between both heterosexuals and homosexuals.\n\nThe Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia later restricted the offense in 1959 to only apply to homosexual anal intercourse; but with the maximum sentence reduced from 2 to 1 year imprisonment.\n\nIn 1977, same-sex sexual intercourse was legalized in the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, while male same-sex sexual intercourse remained illegal in the rest of the Socialist Republic of Serbia (including the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo). In 1990, Vojvodina was reincorporated into the legal system of Serbia, and male homosexuality once again become a criminal offense.\n\nIn 1994, male homosexual sexual intercourse was officially decriminalised in the Republic of Serbia, a part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The age of consent was set at 18 years for anal intercourse between males and 14 for other sexual practices. An equal age of consent of 14 was later introduced on 1 January 2006, regardless of sexual orientation or gender.\n\nWhile same-sex couples have never been recognized by law, the new Serbian Constitution adopted in November 2006, explicitly defines marriage as being between a man and a woman (Article 62). However, other forms of recognition, such as civil unions or domestic partnerships, are not explicitly mentioned nor prohibited.\n\nIn June 2019, plans were announced to legalise domestic partnerships between same-sex couples by amending the Civil Code. Same-sex couples would be able to enjoy several legal rights, including joint property and alimony. They would not be granted inheritance or adoption rights, nor undergo surrogacy arrangements. The legislation remains pending. In July 2019, a lesbian couple, Jelena Dubovic and Sunčica Kopunović, from the northern city of Novi Sad, attempted to register a civil partnership at the municipal registrar's office, but were turned away. They filed a lawsuit, though legal experts believe it is unlikely that they will win the case.\n\nSame-sex couples cannot legally adopt. In early 2019, the Serbian Ministry of Health imposed a ban on those with a \"history of homosexual relations during the last five years\" from donating reproductive cells for artificial insemination or in vitro fertilisation.\n\nUntil 2002, Serbia had no legal protections specifically aimed at LGBT rights.\n\nIn 2002, the National Assembly approved the \"Broadcasting Law\" (, \"Zakon o radiodifuziji\") which prohibits Serbian broadcasting agencies from spreading information encouraging discrimination, hate and violence based on sexual orientation (among other categories).\n\nIn 2005, through a change in the \"Labor Law\" (, \"Zakon o radu\"), discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment was banned. That same year, Parliament approved the \"Law on Higher Education\" (, \"Zakon o visokom obrazovanju\"), which guarantees equal rights regardless of sexual orientation in those institutions (among other categories).\n\nOn 26 March 2009, Parliament approved a unified anti-discrimination law, known as the \"Anti-Discrimination Act of 2009\" (, \"Zakon o zabrani diskiminacije\"), which prohibits, among other categories, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and transgender status in all areas. The law specifically defines discrimination as follows:\n\nOn 5 July 2011, the Parliament approved a youth law, prohibiting discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation. The law regulates measures and activities undertaken by local governments at improving the social status of youth and creating conditions for addressing their needs and interests.\n\nSince 2003, there has been legislation (part of the \"Information Law\" (, \"Zakon o javnom informisanju\")) specifically in place to counter verbal discrimination based on sexual orientation within the media. The same prohibition formed part of the \"Broadcasting Act\" adopted in 2002; however, it was never effectively observed, with the Radio Emitters Agency (an independent government agency) having failed to take any action against offenders. More widely, the \"Anti-Discrimination Law of 2009\" prohibits hate speech on the basis of sexual orientation across wider Serbia society.\n\nOn 24 December 2012, the Serbian Parliament approved changes to the Penal Code to introduce the concept of a \"hate crime\", including on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The first conviction under the law came in 2018.\n\nOn 28 July 2011, the Parliament approved a change in the \"Health Insurance Law\" (, \"Zakon o zdravstvenom osiguranju\"), based on which sex change surgeries became partially covered by the statewide basic medical insurance plan, beginning in 2012.\n\nIn 2012, \"The New York Times\" proclaimed Belgrade as a hub for sex reassignment surgery, as prices for such procedures are far lower than in neighbouring and Western countries.\n\nBefore 2019, transgender people in Serbia were allowed to change their legal gender only after having undergone sex reassignment surgery. Since 2019, it has been possible to change legal gender with a confirmation from a psychiatrist and an endocrinologist after a year of hormone replacement therapy, without undergoing any surgical procedure. Government-financed health insurance covers up to 65% of the surgery, while the remainder is financed by the patient. According to Jovanka Todorović, a program coordinator at Gayten-LGBT, about 80% of Serbian transgender people are not willing to go through surgery. Instead, some choose to have hormone replacement therapy, which is not financed by health insurance. In addition, a reported 90% of LGBT individuals in Serbia argue that medical institutions are not adequately responding to their needs.\n\nIn 2010, the Serbian Army agreed that gay and bisexual men and women may openly serve in the professional army, but that news was not broadcast widely across media.\n\nMany LGBT organizations have been founded in Serbia, especially in Belgrade and Novi Sad, though also in Niš, Kragujevac, Subotica, Šabac and Zrenjanin.\n\nThe first known LGBT organization in Serbia, Arkadija, was founded in 1990 in Belgrade. It shut down in 1995. That same year, Labris was established. Over the years, Labris has become one of Serbia's most prominent LGBT advocacy groups, regularly meeting with local government officials to discuss discrimination and violence prevention, raising awareness of LGBT rights through educational campaigns and public events, and campaigning for increased legal rights for same-sex couples.\n\nOther groups include Gayten LGBT, founded in 2000 in Belgrade, Gay Straight Alliance (\"Gej Strejt Alijansa\"), based in Belgrade, Association Duga (\"Asocijacija Duga\"), based in Šabac and the region, and Belgrade Pride (\"Beograd Prajd\"), established in 2011.\n\nLGBT Vojvodina, Novi Sad Lesbian Organization, and LGBT Novi Sad are among several groups working in the northern region of Serbia, Vojvodina.\n\nGOOSI, based in Belgrade, advocates on behalf and campaigns in favor of LGBT people with disabilities.\n\n\nGays and lesbians continue to face discrimination and harassment in Serbia. The majority of Serbian people retain strong attitudes against homosexuality. There have been numerous instances of violent gay-bashing, the most extreme during the first Belgrade Gay Pride in 2001.\n\nSeveral pride events have had to be cancelled. Pride Day celebrations in Belgrade in 2004, and another in Novi Sad in 2007, were cancelled because of the inability to provide adequate safety against violence due to resource constraints. The 2009 Belgrade Pride was also cancelled for similar reasons, as police could not guarantee the safety of the participants. The Second Belgrade Pride parade went ahead on 10 October 2010, with the participation of around a thousand people. However, it was met with violent reaction culminating in the Belgrade anti-gay riot attended by 6,000 anti-gay protesters and extreme nationalist group members.\n\nOfficial medical textbooks that classify homosexuality under \"sexual deviations and disorders\" were in circulation and widely used. After several requests to do so, the Serbian Medical Society finally stated that same-sex orientation is not a disease in an official letter to Labris, a Serbian LGBT organization, in 2008. Homosexuality has been removed from the official list of diseases since 1997, when Serbia started applying ICD-10. \n\nThe protection of LGBT people in Serbia is further complicated by the existence of various nationalist and neo-nazi associations like \"Obraz\", \"1389\" and \"Stormfront\", which are supported by some right-wing political parties. These groups have, on several occasions, made their threats to LGBT people publicly known, though the media and the police are increasingly reacting to deter such threats publicly.\n\nThe development of LGBT rights and culture in Serbia is supported by LGBT sites such as GayEcho and Gay-Serbia and the oldest Adriatic LGBT Activism mailing list in the region.\n\nIn August 2016, Ana Brnabić was appointed Minister of Public Administration and Local State Governments, becoming the first openly lesbian minister in Serbia. In June 2017, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić appointed Brnabić to be the Prime Minister. She was sworn in on 29 June 2017. Her appointment received criticism and opposition from both left-wing and right-wing groups. Left-wing groups accused Brnabić of being a \"puppet\" to the President and that her sexual orientation would serve as a cover-up for human rights abuses. Right-groups opposed her nomination because of her sexual orientation.\n\nIn 2017, a prominent Serbian LGBT activist, Boban Stojanović, received asylum in Canada after documenting approximately 1,000 different pages of violence directed at him and his partner. In an interview in April 2018, Stojanović's partner said the violence put a lot of pressure on them, compelling the couple to leave Serbia.\n\nIn September 2017, Prime Minister Brnabić took part in the pride parade in Belgrade. At the event, Brnabić said:\nIn February 2019, Milica Đurđić, Brnabić's partner, gave birth to a son named Igor. According to Agence France-Presse, \"Ana Brnabić is one of the first prime ministers whose partner has given birth while in office... and the first in the world in a same-sex couple\".\n\nOn 17 May 2019, on the occasion of International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, several hundred people gathered in the center of Novi Sad for what was described as the northern Serbian city's first gay pride rally. The event was organized by the local nongovernmental group, Exit, with the support of city officials.\n\nIn 2019, asylum was granted to a young Iranian gay man on the basis of his sexual orientation.\n\nAccording to the Commissioner for the Protection of Equality, research carried out in 2012 showed that 48% of Serbs believed that homosexuality is an illness.\n\nAccording to a 2017 poll carried out by ILGA, 59% of Serbians agreed that gay, lesbian and bisexual people should enjoy the same rights as straight people, while 24% disagreed. Additionally, 64% agreed that they should be protected from workplace discrimination. 21% said that people who are in same-sex relationships should be charged as criminals, while 55% disagreed. As for transgender people, 63% agreed that they should have the same rights, 65% believed they should be protected from employment discrimination and 51% believed they should be allowed to change their legal gender. Additionally, a majority of Serbians would accept an LGBT neighbour.\n\nAccording to 2018 data from the Equal Rights Association, 26 percent of the country's population would cease contact with a person if they learned that person was LGBT, 38 percent of population believed that homosexuality was a disease, 48 percent of parents would seek medical treatment for their LGBT child, 70 percent opposed the right of an LGBT person to inherit the property of their deceased partner, and 90 percent opposed child adoption by LGBT person.\n\nAccording to 2017 data from the research conducted by Centre E8, 44.0% of females agree that same-sex marriage should be legal (14.8% totally agree and 29.2% agree) while 38.2% oppose (15.0% totally oppose and 23.2 oppose). At the same time, 32.6% of male respondents agree that same-sex marriage should be legal (12.8% totally agree and 19.6% agree) while 50.8% oppose (26.2% totally oppose and 24.6% oppose).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1799517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799517", "title": "Turkish Air Force", "text": "Turkish Air Force\n\nThe Turkish Air Force () is the aerial warfare service branch of the Turkish Armed Forces. The Turkish Air Force can trace its origins back to June 1911 when it was founded by the Ottoman Empire, however, the air force as it is known today did not come into existence until 1923 with the creation of the Republic of Turkey.\n\nIn 1998, the Turkish Armed Forces announced a program of modernization worth US$160 billion over a twenty-year period in various projects. $45 billion was earmarked to go to the overhaul of the Turkish Air Force, and includes commissioning new combat aircraft (consisting of TAI TFX and Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II) and helicopters (consisting of heavy lift, attack, medium lift and light general purpose helicopters).\n\nAccording to Flight International (Flightglobal.com) and the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the Turkish Air Force has an active strength of 60,000 military personnel and operates approximately 1,067 manned aircraft (2019). The Turkish Air Force's capacity has been reduced since the purges that followed the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, which saw large-scale dismissals of pilots viewed by Turkey's Islamist government as disloyal.\n\nThe world's first black pilot Ahmet Ali Çelikten and first female fighter pilot Sabiha Gökçen both served in the TAF.\n\nThe history of Ottoman military aviation dates back to between June 1909 and July 1911. The Ottoman flight squadrons participated in the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and World War I (1914–1918). The fleet size reached its apex in December 1916, when the Ottoman aviation had 90 active combat aircraft. Some early help for the Ottoman Air Force came from the Imperial German \"Fliegertruppe\" (known by that name before October 1916), with future Central Powers 13-victory flying ace Hans-Joachim Buddecke flying with the Turks early in World War I as just one example. The General Inspectorate of Air Forces (\"Kuva-yı Havaiye Müfettiş-i Umumiliği\") trying to reconstruct itself on July 29, 1918 had no personnel, but only remained as a title on paper.\n\nAfter the end of World War I and the occupation of the Ottoman Empire by the Allies in 1919, some Turkish aviators tried to build new units in Istanbul, İzmir, Konya, Elazığ and Diyarbakır with planes left over from World War I and tried to bring together flight personnel. During the Turkish War of Independence, Turkish pilots joined the Konya Air Station (\"Konya Hava İstasyonu\"). With the formation of the Grand National Assembly (GNA) by Mustafa Kemal and his colleagues on April 23, 1920, in Ankara, and the reorganization of the army, the Branch of Air Forces (\"Kuva-yı Havaiye Şubesi\") was established under the Office of War (\"Harbiye Dairesi\") of the GNA. A few damaged aircraft belonging to the GNA were repaired, and afterwards used in combat.\n\nOn 1 February 1921, the Branch of Air Forces was renamed as the General Directorate of Air Forces (\"Kuva-yı Havaiye Müdüriyet-i Umûmiyesi\") at Eskişehir and on 5 July 1922 reorganized as the Inspectorate of Air Forces (\"Kuva-yı Havaiye Müfettişliği\") at Konya.\n\nAfter the proclamation of independence and sovereignty with the Treaty of Lausanne and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923, approaches were made to form a modern Air Force. Originally consisting of 3 normal and 1 naval aviation units, and an air school, the number of units was increased to 10 normal and 3 naval aviation units. Starting in 1924, personnel were sent abroad for flight education. In 1925 the Air School was reestablished in Eskişehir and its first students graduated in that same year. The Inspectorate of Air Forces was reorganized as Undersecretariat of the Ministry of Defense in 1928 and new schools were found for non-pilot personnel. Some personnel were sent to the United Kingdom and France for training; others were sent to the United States and Italy in 1930.\n\nOn July 1, 1932, air regiments were considered to be a separate combat arm and started training its own personnel. The Turkish aviators began to wear blue uniforms from 1933.\n\nSabiha Gökçen became the first female fighter pilot in military history in 1937. Another key event in 1937 was the establishment of the Air War College (\"Hava Harp Akademisi\").\n\nBy 1940, Turkish air brigades had more than 500 combat aircraft in its inventory, becoming the largest air force in the Balkans and the Middle East. The growing inventory of air brigades required another structural change, which was made in 1940. The Air Undersecretariat under the Ministry of National Defense for logistical affairs and the General Staff for educational affairs were united to form the Air Force Command (\"Hava Kuvvetleri Komutanlığı\") in 1944. Thus, the Air Force became a separate branch of the Turkish Armed Forces. The first Commander of the Turkish Air Force was General Zeki Doğan. Turkey did not enter World War II on the side of the Allies until February 1945. However, the Turkish Armed Forces went on full alert and were prepared for war following the military alliance between neighbouring Bulgaria and the Axis Powers which was formalized in March 1941, and the occupation of neighbouring Greece by the Axis Powers in April 1941. Within a year, Turkey's borders were surrounded by German forces in the northwest and west, and Italian forces in the southwest. The Turkish Air Force made daily reconnaissance flights over Bulgaria, Greece, the Greek Islands in the Aegean Sea, and the Dodecanese Islands which then belonged to Italy, to monitor the positions of the Axis forces. The large cities in western Turkey were darkened at nights, and anti-aircraft guns and searchlights were deployed for defence against possible enemy planes. Almost all available money in the Turkish Government Treasury was used to purchase new weapons from any available provider in the world. The Turkish Air Force received large numbers of new aircraft in this period, including Supermarine Spitfire Mk.I/V/IX/XIX, Curtiss Falcon CW-22R/B, Fairey Battle-I, Avro Anson-I, Hawker Hurricane I/II, Morane-Saulnier M.S.406, Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk, Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk, Westland Lysander-I, Consolidated B-24D Liberator B-24, Bristol Blenheim IV/V, Bristol Beaufort, Bristol Beaufighter Mk.I/X, Focke-Wulf Fw 190-A3, Martin 187 Baltimore, De Havilland DH.98 Mosquito Mk.III/IV, Douglas B-26B/C Invader, P-47D Thunderbolt and Douglas C-47A/B Dakota.\n\nThe Air Machinist School (\"Hava Makinist Okulu\") was reorganized as Aircraft Maintenance School (\"Hava Uçak Bakım Okulu\") on 2 January 1950 to unite schools responsible for training non-pilot Air Force personnel. In 1950 it also was decided to upgrade the Air Force fleet through the inclusion of jets. Eight pilots were sent to the United States for jet pilot training. They graduated in 1951 and started training jet pilots in the Turkish Air Force. In the same year, the 9th Fighter Wing (9uncu Ana Jet Üssü) was founded in Balıkesir as Turkey's first fighter wing; the 191st, 192nd, and 193rd squadrons being the first ones which were established. Further training in the United States followed, usually involving jet manufacturers. In 1951 the Air Force Academy was formed with integrating some air schools in Eskişehir and its first academic year started on 1 October 1951. In 1956 the \"Hava Eğitim Kolordu Komutanlığı\" (Air Education Corps Command) was founded and all education was united under this command. The command was renamed as \"Hava Eğitim Komutanlığı\" (Air Education Command) in 1957.\n\nUpon Turkey's membership to NATO in 1952, the process of modernization was accelerated. In 1962 the \"Taktik Hava Kuvveti\" (Tactical Air Force) was founded by upgrading the \"Hava Tümeni\" (Air Division) units to corps-level organizations. In 1974 the Air Force was employed in the Cyprus War. With the arrival of 3rd generation fighter jets in 1980, the Air Force was reorganized.\n\nThe headquarters of NATO's Allied Air Component Command for Southern Europe (formerly designated as AIRSOUTH and originally headquartered in Naples, Italy) was established in İzmir, Turkey, on 11 August 2004. Allied Air Command İzmir was deactivated on 1 June 2013, when the Allied Air Command (AIRCOM) at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany became the sole Allied Air Component Command of NATO.\n\nTurkey is one of five NATO member states which are part of the nuclear sharing policy of the alliance, together with Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. A total of 90 B61 nuclear bombs are hosted at the Incirlik Air Base, 40 of which are allocated for use by the Turkish Air Force in case of a nuclear conflict, but their use requires the approval of NATO. , the United States is considering withdrawing these nuclear bombs from Turkey, and from several other foreign locations in Europe.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, thousands of military officers were dismissed, with many arrested and jailed. As Air Force pilots had played a major role in the coup attempt (the headquarters of the coup attempt was at the Akinci base near the capital Ankara), more than 350 F-16 pilots were also jailed, leaving the Air Force with more airplanes than pilots. In response, the Turkish government has sought to compel retired pilots to return to the military and to strengthen its air defence systems. A former head of the Air Force was dismissed, as well as 42% of Air Force generals and several base commanders, including the commander of the important Incirlik Air Base.\n\n\nIn 1984 Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) was established and Turkey started to produce fighter aircraft locally under license, including a total of 232 F-16 Fighting Falcon (Block 30/40/50) aircraft for the air force. The air force had previously received 8 F-16s that were purchased directly from the United States, bringing the total number of F-16s received by the air force to 240. TAI is currently building 30 new F-16 Block 50+ aircraft for the TuAF and is applying a CCIP upgrade on the existing fleet of Block 30/40/50 F-16s, which will bring all of them to the Block 50+ standard. Dozens of TAI-built F-16s were also exported to other countries, particularly in the Middle East. A total of 46 TAI-built F-16s have been exported to the Egyptian Air Force under the Peace Vector IV Program (1993–1995), making it TAI's second-largest F-16 customer after the Turkish Air Force. Turkey is one of only five countries in the world which locally produce the F-16 Fighting Falcon.\n\nTurkey placed an order for 30 F-35 Lightning II's with four delivered to Luke Air Force Base, and then had the order cancelled due to the country's acquisition of the S-400 SAM systems from Russia.\n\nA total of four Boeing 737 AEW&C Peace Eagle () aircraft (together with ground support systems) were ordered by the Turkish Air Force, with an option for two more aircraft. Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) is the primary subcontractor for the Peace Eagle parts production, aircraft modification, assembly and tests. Another subcontractor, Havelsan, is responsible for system analysis and software support.\n\nSigned on 23 July 2003, the contract to Boeing valued at US$1.385 billion, which was later reduced by US$59 million because some of the requirements were not met. The down payment to Boeing amounted to US$637 million. The project consists of the delivery of 737-700 airframes, ground radars and control systems, ground control segments for mission crew training, mission support and maintenance support.\n\nPeace Eagle 1 is modified and tested by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems in Seattle, Washington, USA. Peace Eagle 2, 3 and 4 are modified and tested at the facilities of TAI in Ankara, Turkey, with the participation of Boeing and a number of Turkish companies. As of 2006, the four Peace Eagle airplanes were scheduled to be delivered in 2008. As of mid-2007, systems integration was ongoing and airworthiness certification works continued. In September 2007, Boeing completed the first test flight of Turkey's AEW&C 737.\n\nOn 4 June 2008, it was announced that Turkish Aerospace Industries completed the first in-country modification of a Boeing 737-700 into an airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) platform for Turkey's Peace Eagle program.\n\nThe first Peace Eagle aircraft, named \"Kuzey\" (meaning North) was formally accepted into Turkish Air Force inventory on 21 February 2014. The remaining three aircraft will be named \"Güney\" (South), \"Doğu\" (East) and \"Batı\" (West).\n\nThe six-year delay was a result of Boeing experiencing difficulties while developing some features required by the Turkish Air Force. Turkey demanded compensation of US$183 million from Boeing for the delay. The payment of the penalty is requested in the form of increased start-up support period from an initially planned two years to five years, as well as three years of software maintenance service and around US$32 million in spare parts.\n\nIn 1994 the Turkish Air Force signed a deal to lease two and purchase seven Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker aerial refueling tanker aircraft. Following the arrival of all seven purchased aircraft, the two leased KC-135Rs were returned to the United States. All seven KC-135R Stratotanker aircraft of the Turkish Air Force have received the Pacer CRAG (Compass, Radar And GPS) upgrade. The KC-135R-CRAG Stratotanker aerial refueling tanker aircraft of the Turkish Air Force are operated by the 101st Squadron, stationed at the Incirlik Air Base.\n\nTurkey is a partner nation in the Airbus A400M Atlas production program. The Turkish Air Force has ordered a total of ten A400M Atlas aircraft. The first two A400M Atlas were delivered to the Turkish Air Force in 2014. All A400M Atlas deliveries to the Turkish Air Force are scheduled to be completed by 2018. Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) produces several components of the A400M Atlas, including the middle-front fuselage, emergency exit doors, rear fuselage upper panels, rear upper escape doors, ailerons and spoilers; which are sent to the Airbus Military factory in Spain for assembly.\n\nAlthough the Airbus A400M Atlas is essentially a heavy tactical lift aircraft, it can also be transformed into an aerial refueling tanker aircraft at short notice.\n\nThe Turkish Air Force also uses the CASA CN-235, C-130 Hercules and C-160 Transall military transport aircraft.\n\nAt present, the Turkish Air Force operates MALE UAVs such as the TAI Anka, Bayraktar Tactical UAS, IAI Heron and the I-GNAT ER. Having been unable to purchase the armed version of Predator UCAVs from the United States, Turkey plans to produce armed UCAV versions of TAI Anka (to be fitted with missiles such as the AGM-114 Hellfire and Roketsan Cirit); while TAI has become the leading partner in the Talarion UCAV project of EADS.\n\nTurkish Air Force operate an intelligence satellite named Göktürk-2, with plans to commission more in years ahead. These include a 0.8m resolution reconnaissance satellite (Project Göktürk-1) for use by the Turkish Armed Forces and a 2m resolution reconnaissance satellite (Project Göktürk-2) for use by the National Intelligence Organization. The production of Göktürk-2 is completed by the Turkish Aerospace Industries, while Göktürk-1 is still in the production stage. Some electro-optical parts that are required for the Göktürk-1 (0.8m resolution) satellite were beyond TAI's technological know-how, thus a foreign partner was sought. The official bidders for the project were EADS Astrium (U.K.), OHB-System (Germany) and Telespazio (Italy); and the contract was won by Telespazio of Italy.\n\nGöktürk-2 was launched from Jiuquan Launch Area 4 / SLS-2 in China by a Long March 2D space launch vehicle at 16:12:52 UTC on December 18, 2012. It was placed into a low Earth orbit of at 16:26 UTC. The first signal from Göktürk-2 was received at 17:39 UTC by the Tromsø Satellite Station, northern Norway.\n\nIn 2013 Turkey approved the construction by ROKETSAN of its first satellite launching center, initially for low earth orbit satellites.\n\nIn 2015, Ukraine and Turkey agreed on space program which worth billions of dollars.\n\nFor a long period of time the combat units of the Turkish Air Force were organized into a 1st Air Force (deployed in the western part of the country and headquartered in Eskişehir) and a 2nd Air Force (deployed in the eastern part of the country and headquartered in Diyarbakır). On August 5, 2014 the two have been fused into the newly formed Combatant Air Force and Air Defence Command with headquarters in Eskişehir. After the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt and because of its involvement in it the 4th Main Jet Air Base Command near Ankara has been disbanded in disgrace and its F-16 dispersed to other bases.\n\n\nThe above commands consist of:\n\n\nOn July 11, 2002 Turkey became a Level 3 partner of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) development program, and on January 25, 2007, Turkey officially joined the production phase of the JSF program, agreeing to initially purchase 116 F-35A Lightning II aircraft.\n\nTurkey also has a national fifth generation fighter aircraft project named the TAI TFX.\n\nOn 28 March 2013, the Turkish Secretary of the Defence Industry of the Ministry of National Defence of Turkey Murat Bayar announced intentions to replace the F-16 fighter with domestically produced fighters by 2023.\n\nHavelsan of Turkey and Boeing of the United States are in the process of developing a next generation, high-altitude ballistic missile defence shield. It is envisaged that the system will be used by the U.S., Turkey and other NATO member states.\n\nIn June 2018 the US Senate passed a defense spending bill that now prevents the Turkish Air Force from obtaining the F-35 stealth fighter. Tensions between the US and Turkey are to blame for the denied contract, and now may put Turkey in a position to become the first customer for Russia's Su-57.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1799518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799518", "title": "Old Colony Railroad", "text": "Old Colony Railroad\n\nThe Old Colony Railroad (OC) was a major railroad system, mainly covering southeastern Massachusetts and parts of Rhode Island, which operated from 1845 to 1893. Old Colony trains ran from Boston to points such as Plymouth, Fall River, New Bedford, Newport, Providence, Fitchburg, Lowell and Cape Cod. For many years the Old Colony Railroad Company also operated steamboat and ferry lines, including those of the Fall River Line with express train service from Boston to its wharf in Fall River where passengers boarded luxury liners to New York City. The company also briefly operated a railroad line on Martha's Vineyard, as well as the freight-only Union Freight Railroad in Boston. The OC was named after the \"Old Colony\", the nickname for the Plymouth Colony.\n\nFrom 1845 to 1893, the OC network grew extensively largely through a series of mergers and acquisitions with other established railroads, until it was itself acquired by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad under lease agreement on March 1, 1893 for its entire network. After this date, all trains, lines, and stations became known as the \"Old Colony Division\" of the huge \"New Haven\" system. During this period, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad enjoyed a virtual monopoly on all passenger and freight rail service in southern New England.\n\nPassenger service on the New Haven's Old Colony Division ended in 1959, except for the main line between Boston and Providence, which continues to be used for passenger service by Amtrak and the MBTA. Since 1997, other former OC lines have been reopened to passenger service, including the MBTA's \"Old Colony Lines\" with service from Boston to Plymouth and Middleborough/Lakeville. In 2007, MBTA passenger service was restored on the Greenbush Line between Braintree and Greenbush Station in Scituate. The MBTA currently has plans to also restore passenger service to Fall River and New Bedford as part of the South Coast Rail project.\n\nOther parts of the former OC system continue to be used for freight service by CSX Transportation and other short line railroads, including the Massachusetts Coastal Railroad which operates on Cape Cod and in southeastern Massachusetts. Parts of the former OC on Cape Cod are also still used to operate the Cape Cod Central Railroad tourist train from Hyannis to Buzzards Bay during the summer and fall months. Another tourist railroad, the Old Colony and Newport Scenic Railway operates on part of the former OC from Newport on Aquidneck Island.\n\nSeveral abandoned portions of the OC have been converted into multi-use rail trails. These include the East Bay Bike Path in Rhode Island, as well as others in Lowell, Mansfield, Fairhaven, and the Cape Cod Rail Trail on Cape Cod.\n\nBy the early 1840s, the city of Boston had six major rail lines connecting it with other places including Lowell, Maine, Fitchburg, and Salem to the north, Worcester to the west and Providence, Rhode Island to the southwest. The southeastern part of Massachusetts had yet to be served by a rail link to Boston.\n\nOn March 16, 1844 the Old Colony Railroad Corporation was formed to provide a rail connection between Boston and Plymouth. Construction of the line began in South Boston in June 1844 and the line opened to Plymouth on November 10, 1845. The extension from South Boston to the newly completed Kneeland Street Station in Boston opened on June 19, 1847. Kneeland Street also served as the headquarters for the OC until the 1893 consolidation.\n\nThere had previously been an Old Colony Railroad formed in 1838 for a line between Taunton and New Bedford, but the name was changed to the New Bedford and Taunton Railroad in 1839 before service began in 1840. This line would later become part of OC in 1879.\n\nJohn Sever of Kingston, Massachusetts served as the first president of the Old Colony Railroad Corporation from 1844-1845. Nathan Carruth served as the second president of the corporation from 1845 to 1848. Carruth was a successful businessman and enthusiastic supporter of the expansion of railroads in Massachusetts and elsewhere in New England. With the opening of the Old Colony line through Dorchester in 1845, Carruth became actively involved in the development of the area. He built an estate on the east side of Dorchester Avenue called Beechmont/Beaumont which would become one of the first railroad suburbs in America.\n\nAll OC locomotives were named until 1884, after which they were simply numbered. Among the early engines were the \"Mayflower\", \"Governor Carver\", \"Governor Bradford\", and \"Miles Standish\". The new railroad company also built the \"Samoset Hotel\" near the end of its line in Plymouth.\n\nIn 1847, the OC completed a short connector line from its main line at Whitman to the Fall River Railroad line at Bridgewater Junction. On April 1, 1849, OC signed a lease of the South Shore Railroad for a period of five years. By 1851, traffic on the line had increased enough to warrant the opening of a second track running between Boston and South Braintree.\n\nThe OC and Fall River Railroad merged with a joint stock vote on June 20, 1854, forming the \"Old Colony and Fall River Railroad Company\", which provided a two-pronged line from Boston to Plymouth and Boston to Fall River, splitting at South Braintree. Alexander Holmes from Kingston served as company president during this period, from 1854 to 1866.\n\nThe Fall River Railroad had been formed on August 8, 1845, with the consolidation of three companies; the Fall River Branch Railroad, the Randolph and Bridgewater Railroad and the Middleborough Railroad. The Fall River Railroad was led by Richard Borden, a prominent Fall River mill owner who wanted a direct route to Boston that did not require the use of the Boston and Providence Railroad lines. The line from South Braintree to Myricks in the town of Berkley opened on December 16, 1846, as an extension of the Fall River Branch Railroad – which had been completed in 1845.\n\nOn May 19, 1847, the first \"boat train\" left the OC's Kneeland Street Station in Boston bound for Fall River, where passengers would board a steamship for New York City. Over the years, the \"Old Colony Steamboat Express\" train would become the most famous line of the Old Colony Railroad, with the finest and most up-to-date engines, cars and attention to detail.\n\nIn 1863 the Old Colony and Fall River Railroad acquired the Dorchester and Milton Branch Railroad Company, which it had been leasing since 1848.\n\nThe \"Old Colony and Newport Railway\" was formed in July 1863 when the Old Colony and Fall River Railroad merged with the Newport and Fall River Railroad, which had been incorporated in 1846 to build a road from Newport, Rhode Island to the Massachusetts state line at Fall River. However, the road from Fall River to the Rhode Island state line was not authorized by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts until 1860. The newly formed and renamed \"Old Colony and Newport Railway Company\" completed the final section of the line from Fall River to Newport which finally opened for service on February 5, 1864.\n\nIn 1865, the Old Colony and Newport Railway Company acquired the Dighton and Somerset Railroad. It completed a new, more direct route between Fall River and Boston via South Braintree on September 24, 1866. Part of the new route was over the Easton Branch Railroad between Stoughton and North Easton. In 1871 the Old Colony purchased the Easton Branch.\n\nA portion of the old Granite Railway line was acquired in 1870 and later extended to form a loop through West Quincy off the original Plymouth line. In 1872, the Old Colony & Newport Railway Corporation built the Shawmut Railroad as a connection between the Dorchester and Milton Branch and the main line to Boston.\n\nThe Old Colony and Newport Railroad merged with the Cape Cod Railroad on May 1, 1872, and the two companies were consolidated on October 1, forming a new \"Old Colony Railroad Company\" under the leadership of Onslow Stearns, who served as president of the company from 1866 to 1877.\n\nThe 1872 merger formed a system with three main branches; Boston to Plymouth, South Braintree to Fall River and Newport, and a third splitting from the Newport branch at Middleborough to Hyannis. At this point, the newly acquired lines became known as the Cape Cod Division, with a new superintendent's office located at Hyannis.\n\nThe Cape Cod Railroad Company had been established in 1846 as the Cape Cod Branch Railroad with a line off the Fall River Railroad from Middleborough to Sandwich opening in 1848. Among the proponents of the Cape Cod Branch Railroad was Richard Borden of Fall River, who saw the new line as an opportunity to bring more traffic and business through his hometown. In 1853, the extension of the line to Hyannis was started, reaching West Barnstable on December 22, 1853. On February 22, 1854, the Cape Cod Branch Railroad was renamed the Cape Cod Railroad Company. In the spring of 1854, construction continued, with the railroad reaching Barnstable village on May 8, Yarmouth Port on May 19, and finally Hyannis on July 8, 1854. Connecting steamboat service to Nantucket commenced from Hyannis in late September and would continue until 1872, when the railroad branch to Woods Hole was opened.\n\nThe Cape Cod Central Railroad was incorporated in 1861 as a branch from the Cape Cod Railroad, running from Yarmouth east and northeast to Orleans, and opening in 1865. The Cape Cod Central was purchased by the Cape Cod Railroad April 21, 1868, and the two railroads were consolidated on July 28, 1868.\n\nThe newly formed Old Colony Railroad extended the line to Provincetown, at the very tip of Cape Cod, opening on July 23, 1873.\n\nIn 1874, Old Colony founded the Martha's Vineyard Railroad, built across on sand of the island of Martha's Vineyard, running from the Oak Bluffs steamer wharf to Mattakeeset Lodge in Katama, Edgartown. The locomotive \"Active\" (later renamed the \"South Beach\") was the sole operating train. This branch existed until 1896.\n\nThe Old Colony Railroad acquired the Middleborough and Taunton Railroad in 1874 and the South Shore Railroad in 1877, which it had once leased until 1854. A year later in 1878 it acquired the Duxbury and Cohasset Railroad which gave the Old Colony a connection with its original 1845 main line at Kingston. Beginning in 1874, the Old Colony operated the \"South Shore, Duxbury and Cohasset and Plymouth Express\" between Boston and Plymouth on this line.\n\nIn 1875, the Old Colony Railroad began operating the Fall River, Warren and Providence Railroad, which had been formed in 1863 as a merger between the Warren and Fall River and Fall River and Warren Railroad Companies. The Old Colony would later acquire this line outright in 1892.\n\nIn 1879, the Old Colony Railroad greatly expanded its network into Central Massachusetts by leasing the Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg and New Bedford Railroad for 999 years, then purchasing it outright in 1883. The acquisition of this line provided important connections for the Old Colony, such as with the Boston and Providence Railroad at Mansfield, the Boston and Albany Railroad at South Framingham and the Fitchburg Railroad at Fitchburg, among others. This deal also gave the Old Colony Railroad direct access to the important industrial port of New Bedford. Upon this acquisition, the lines of the former Boston, Clinton and Fitchburg Railroad became known as the Old Colony's \"Northern Division\", with headquarters in Fitchburg, while the older OCRR lines became known as the \"Central Division\" with headquarters in Boston.\n\nIn 1882 the Old Colony Railroad signed a 99-year lease on a line between Fall River and New Bedford through the towns of Dartmouth and Westport owned by the Fall River Railroad (1874) – not to be confused with its 1846 namesake.\n\nIn 1886 the Old Colony Railroad acquired the Lowell and Framingham Railroad, which before 1871 had been known as the Framingham and Lowell Railroad.\n\nIn 1887 the Old Colony Railroad acquired the Hanover Branch Railroad. On April 1, 1888, the Old Colony Railroad signed a 99-year lease agreement the Nantasket Beach Railroad with service to Hull.\n\nSeveral days later, on April 7, 1888 the OCRR signed a 99-year lease on the Boston and Providence Railroad, one of New England's earliest railroads, which had been chartered in Massachusetts in 1831 and began service between Providence and Boston in 1835. This major agreement gave the Old Colony Railroad operating rights on the busy double-tracked main line between the two capital cities, along with other branches to Dedham and Stoughton. The deal also included use of the Boston and Providence Railroad's Park Square Station in Boston.\n\nIn 1891 the OCRR signed a 99-year lease of the Providence, Warren and Bristol Railroad. In December 1892, the OCRR signed a 99-year lease of the Plymouth and Middleborough Railroad properties.\n\nIn 1896 the OCRR acquired the Fall River Railroad (1874), which it had been leasing since 1882.\n\nOn March 1, 1893 the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NYNH&H) – commonly known as the New Haven Railroad – leased the entire Old Colony system for 99 years, which by then included the leased Boston and Providence Railroad and everything substantially east of it, as well as long branches northwest to Fitchburg and Lowell. Along with the lease of the New England Railroad in 1898, the 1893 lease arrangement gave the NYNH&H a virtual monopoly on rail transport in southern New England.\n\nWith the opening of Boston's South Station in 1899, the Kneeland Street Station was taken over by the Boston and Albany Railroad as a local freight office. It was demolished in 1918 after being deemed unsafe.\n\nDespite high ridership, the Old Colony line had been a source of problems for the New Haven Railroad. In 1935, the then-bankrupt New Haven attempted to default on its lease and return ownership of the line to the Old Colony stockholders. However, this drove the Old Colony, which had not run trains in over thirty years, to bankruptcy in one day and the New Haven was forced to run the trains by court order, with a provision that if losses exceeded a certain amount they could abandon the line. The Old Colony Division enjoyed a brief renaissance in the early 1950s under the pro-commuter term of President Frederick C. Dumaine, Jr., however this was not to last. The New Haven's accountants used to shift a greater amount of debt to the Old Colony Division, and the railroad announced that all passenger service would end in 1958. An emergency subsidy was approved by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for another year, and service finally ended in 1959 with the opening of the Southeast Expressway, which along with Route 24 runs alongside or parallel to the former Old Colony right-of-ways in many sections.\n\nThe NYNH&H merged into Penn Central in 1969, which was, in turn, merged into Conrail in 1976.\n\nSince the early 1970s, Amtrak has provided passenger service from South Station in Boston over the former Boston and Providence lines of the Old Colony Railroad. Since December, 2000, Amtrak has also used this line for the Acela Express high-speed passenger rail service to Washington, D.C. Between 1986 and 1996 Amtrak also operated regular passenger service between New York City and Hyannis on Cape Cod during the summer months.\n\nWith the establishment of Conrail, freight service continued over various portions of the former Old Colony network after 1976. Beginning in 1982, the Bay Colony Railroad provided freight service on various lines which the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had purchased from Conrail, including lines on Cape Cod and in Middlesex County. Since 1999, CSX has provided freight service over several portions of the former Old Colony Railroad network, including lines in Taunton, Fall River, New Bedford and Leominster. Since 2008, the Massachusetts Coastal Railroad has taken over operation of the state-owned freight lines on Cape Cod from the Bay Colony Railroad.\n\nThe Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) currently operates passenger service on portions of the network, including the Red Line rapid transit service to Quincy and Braintree, and the Ashmont–Mattapan High Speed Line. The MBTA also currently operates commuter rail service over portions of the former Old Colony Railroad network, including its Providence/Stoughton Line and portions of the Needham Line. The MBTA also restored service on the Plymouth/Kingston Line and Middleborough/Lakeville Line in the 1990s, and the Greenbush Line (part of the South Shore Branch) opened in 2007.\n\nTwo portions of the OC network are also currently used for tourist trains during certain parts of the year, including the Cape Cod Central Railroad and the Old Colony and Newport Scenic Railway.\n\nBetween 1986 and 2016, the Old Colony & Fall River Railroad Museum operated in Fall River. The museum had four train cars and exhibits.\n\n\nThe following is a description of the Old Colony Railroad lines and branches at about the time of the 1893 lease to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, and shortly thereafter.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1799523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799523", "title": "Gendarmerie General Command", "text": "Gendarmerie General Command\n\nThe Gendarmerie General Command () is a service branch of the Turkish Ministry of Interior responsible for the maintenance of the public order in areas that fall outside the jurisdiction of police forces (generally in rural areas), as well as assuring internal security along with carrying out other specific duties assigned to it by certain laws and regulations.\n\nThe Commander of the Gendarmerie reports to the Minister of the Interior.\n\nThe Gendarmerie has its roots in the Ottoman Empire military law enforcement organization \"Subaşı\" (later known as the \"Zaptiye\"). A similar, earlier force called \"Şurta\" existed during the medieval Seljuq Empire.\n\nAfter the abolition of the Janissary corps of the Ottoman Empire in 1826, military organizations called \"Asâkir-i Muntazâma-i Mansûre\", \"Asâkir-i Muntazâma-i Hâssa\", and, in 1834, \"Asâkir-i Redîfe\" were established for security and public order in Anatolia and in some provinces of Rumelia.\nSince the term Gendarmerie was noticed only in the Assignment Decrees published in the years following the declaration of Tanzimat in 1839, it is assumed that the Gendarmerie organization was founded after that year, but the exact date of foundation has not yet been determined. Therefore, the date on which the name \"Asâkir-i Zaptiye Nizâmnâmesi\" was adopted, June 14 1839, is considered the foundation date of the Turkish Gendarmerie.\n\nAfter the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War, Ottoman prime minister Mehmed Said Pasha decided to bring some officers from Britain and France to establish a modern law enforcement organization. After the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, the Gendarmerie achieved great successes, particularly in Rumelia. In 1909, the Gendarmerie was affiliated with the Ministry of War, and its name was changed to the Gendarmerie General Command ().\n\nGendarmerie units continued their internal security duties as well as taking part in the conflict at various fronts as a part of the Armed Forces during World War I and the Turkish War of Independence.\n\nThe Gendarmerie organization achieved its current legal status on June 10, 1930. In 1939, the Gendarmerie organization was restructured, having three groups: Fixed Gendarmerie Units, Mobile Gendarmerie Units, and Gendarmerie Training Units and Schools.\n\nIn 1956, the Gendarmerie General Command was assigned the duties of protecting borders, coasts and territorial waters, and fighting smuggling, which had been previously carried out by the \"Gümrük Umum Kumandanlığı\", under the Ministry of Customs and Monopoly. In 1957, Gendarmerie Border Units were transformed into brigades, and Gendarmerie Training Brigades were established.\n\nIn 1961, Gendarmerie Regional Commands were established.

{"id": "1799525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799525", "title": "Antipathy", "text": "Antipathy\n\nAntipathy is a voluntary or involuntary dislike for something or somebody, the opposite of sympathy. While antipathy may be induced by experience, it sometimes exists without a rational cause-and-effect explanation being present to the individuals involved.\n\nThus, the origin of antipathy has been subject to various philosophical and psychological explanations, which some people find convincing and others regard as highly speculative. The exploration of a philosophical aspect for antipathy has been found in an essay by John Locke, an early modern 17th century philosopher.\n\nInterpersonal antipathy is often irrationally ascribed to mannerisms or certain physical characteristics, which are perceived as signs for character traits (e.g., close, deep set eyes as a sign for dullness or cruelty). Further, the negative feeling sometimes takes place rapidly and without reasoning, functioning below the level of attention, thus resembling an automatic process. \n\nChester Alexander’s empirical findings suggest that an important characteristic of antipathies is that they are \"marginal to reflective consciousness\". Alexander based this conclusion on the fact that many of the subjects of the study reported to have never thought much about their antipathies, have not tried to analyze them or discuss them with others. \n\nSympathy and antipathy modify social behavior. Although it is generally assumed that antipathy causes avoidance, some empirical studies gathered evidence that an antipathetic reaction to objects was not followed by any effort to avoid future encounters.\n\nIn personality psychology, antipathy may be related to low agreeableness.\n\nSophie Bryant observed the occurrence of pseudo-antipathy which consists in \"the careless and arbitrary interpretation of another person's acts and expressions in accordance with the worst side of one's self\". In other words, people tend to project their own faults onto others and dislike or hate them. Pseudo-antipathy is based on the (implicit) knowledge about the negative sides of a person's own character. Bryant compares the resulting feeling with \"a certain wrong-headed sense of cleansing\".\n"}
{"id": "1799534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799534", "title": "Ma'an", "text": "Ma'an\n\nMa'an () is a city in southern Jordan, southwest of the capital Amman. It serves as the capital of the Ma'an Governorate. Its population is approximately 41,055 in 2015. Civilizations with the name of Ma'an have existed at least since the Nabatean period—the modern city is just northwest of the ancient town. The city is an important transport hub situated on the ancient King's Highway and also on the modern Desert Highway.\n\nMa'an was founded by the Minaeans (known as \"Ma'in\" in Arabic), an ancient Arab people based in Yemen, between the 2nd and 4th century BCE. The site was located on a major trade route and was settled by Minaean traders and merchants. Local tradition has it that the city was named after \"Ma'an\", the son of Lot.\n\nDuring the Byzantine era in Syria, Ma'an was part of the territory of the Arab Christian tribe of Banu Judham who served as vassals for the Byzantines in Transjordan. In the early 7th century, the Christian governor of Ma'an, Farwa ibn Amr al-Judhami, converted to Islam and sent Muhammad a wide array of presents including a white mule and gold. When the Byzantine authorities learned of his conversion he was ordered to repent his new religion, but refused. Consequently, the Byzantine emperor ordered his imprisonment and subsequent execution by crucifixion. In retaliation the Muslim state in Medina, sent an army led by Usama ibn Zayd to conquer Ma'an.\n\nWhen the Umayyads took control of the Caliphate, Ma'an entered a period of relative prosperity. In 951 the Persian geographer Istakhri described it as \"a small town on the border of the desert.\" He claimed that most of its inhabitants belonged the Umayyad family or their clients even though by that time the Umayyads had been overthrown by the Abbasid Caliphate. Istakhri further noted that Ma'an served as a fortress in the Sharah District (today southern Jordan) and \"travelers were well received.\" A market was organized in the city where pilgrims could store their unessential possessions.\n\nWhen Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi visited in the early 13th century, during Ayyubid rule, Ma'an was a mostly ruined town in the Balqa district of Bilad al-Sham (Islamic province of Syria.) The Hajj pilgrimage route to Mecca still passed through the town which also contained a resting station. By the end of the 13th-century Syria's new rulers, the Bahri Mamluks, designated Ma'an and its surroundings as one of four districts of the al-Karak province. According to al-Dimashqi, during that time period, it grew to become a \"small city,\", with a \"khan\" (\"caravanserai\") that included a \"market for provisions\" and a hostel. Muslim traveler Ibn Batutah noted Ma'an was \"the last place in Syria\" before reaching Aqaba as-Sawan in the Hejaz.\n\nBecause of its geographic isolation from the rest of Syria and a low frequency of travelers (with the exception of Mecca-bound pilgrims), the history of Ma'an was the least well-documented of the Transjordanian districts of Ottoman Syria—at least until direct rule was attempted in the late 19th century. The Ottomans annexed Transjordan in 1517 and in 1559, during the tenure of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottomans built a fort in Ma'an to safeguard the pilgrimage route. The governor of Damascus put down a revolt by Ma'an and other cities in south Damascus Eyalet in 1656, although Ottoman troops were later routed as a result of a revolt by the Banu Tamim tribe. Since then, the Ottomans had struggled to maintain full control of the area.\n\nMa'an was divided into two distinct quarters since the Umayyad period: Ma'an al-Shamiyya and Ma'an al-Hijaziyya. The latter served as the main town, while the former was a small neighborhood inhabited by Syrians from the north. The city continued to be a major town on the Hajj pilgrimage route and its economy was entirely dependent on it. Its principal trade partner was the coastal city of Gaza in southern Palestine, from where supplies were brought to Ma'an for resale to pilgrims. Provisions were also imported from Hebron. In addition to provisions, Ma'an's outward caravan was dominated by the sale of livestock, particularly camels for transport and sheep for ritual sacrifice. The incoming caravan was a buyer's market for goods coming from across the Muslim world. Ma'an's culture was highly influenced by its role on the Hajj route and unlike many other desert towns, most of its residents were literate and many served as imams or religious advisers for the Bedouin tribes in the area. Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt noted that the people of Ma'an \"considered their town an advanced post to the sacred city of Medina.\" The townspeople's relationship with Bedouin was also unique. While most Transjordanian towns had uneasy relationships with the nomadic tribes to whom they paid regular tribute (\"khuwwa\"), Ma'an's residents and the Bedouin enjoyed positive relations. Finnish explorer Georg August Wallin wrote the level of economic interdependence between the two groups was unlike anywhere else in Syria's desert regions. As a testament to their relationship of mutual trust, Ma'an's inhabitants were able to bargain down or withhold payment of the \"khuwwa\" during tough economic years. The major tribes around the city were the 'Anizzah and the Huwaytat.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, there were numerous attempts by the Ottoman authorities to elevate Ma'an's political status at over al-Karak, although most attempts failed or were short-lived. In 1868 the Ottoman governor of Syria, Rashid Pasha, succeeded in designating Ma'an as its own \"kaza\" (subdistrict) of the al-Balqa \"sanjak\" (district), part of Damascus Vilayet. Four years later, Governor Abdulletif Subhi Pasha proposed that Ma'an become a \"sanjak\" that would include al-Karak, as-Salt and al-Jawf. This proposal was popular with much of the Ottoman government in Istanbul, but was ultimately rejected after strong opposition from Midhat Pasha, a leading Tanzimat reformer, who argued the administrative expenses of having Ma'an as district capital would not be feasible.\n\nFollowing the British occupation of Egypt, Ottoman politicians began serious initiatives to form a new \"vilayet\" out of Damascus Vilayet that would combine the districts of Ma'an, al-Balqa and Jerusalem to serve as a buffer against a potential British invasion of Syria. This effort failed, although a new proposal in 1886 would see Ma'an serve as the capital of a district including the \"kazas\" of al-Karak and Tafilah and the \"nahiyas\" (subdistricts smaller than \"kazas\") of Amman, Bani Hamida and Wadi Musa. Governor Osman Nuri Pasha's goal in this respect was to establish a government center in southern Transjordan to \"avoid the alienation of the people.\" Sultan Abdulhamid II approved the plan in 1892. However, the establishment of the new sanjak was delayed and eventually scrapped after the leading sheikh of al-Karak offered the Ottoman authorities his full services. Al-Karak was deemed more suitable as district capital due to its larger population, proximity to Palestine and the established relationships between the Majali notables of the city and the authorities in Damascus and Istanbul.\n\nBetween 1897 and 1899, two primary schools for boys and a secondary school were founded by the Ottomans in Ma'an. In 1902 the Ma'an train station connected the city to Damascus and Medina.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Aqaba during the Arab Revolt, the Turkish army fortified Maan with 6000 infantry, a regiment of cavalry and mounted infantry, and an aerodrome, all under the command of Behjet Pasha. This important Ottoman military base and communications hub was under 5-day siege by the Arab Northern Army during the Battle of Maan, 13-17 April 1918. Though failing to capture the city, the Hejaz railway southwards was wrecked.\n\nIn 1920, The Hashemite emir Abdullah I arrived in Ma'an in with several hundred fighters mostly from the 'Utaybah tribe in an attempt to restore the Sharifian throne in Damascus following its overthrow by France. He addressed the French colonization of Syria by stating to Ma'an's residents \"The colonialist has come to you to rob you of the three graces: faith, freedom and masculinity.\" Following the British capture of the area during World War I, the British Mandate of Palestine was established in 1922 and included Transjordan which was semi-autonomous from British administration in Palestine. Ma'an was annexed to the Transjordanian state in 1925. The British Army had an armored car regiment based in the city.\n\nA railway building at Ma'an station was used by Abdullah I as the site of the first government of the Kingdom of Jordan. It is now called the Ma'an Palace and is depicted on the reverse of the 5 Jordanian dinar note.\n\nIn 1998 a large demonstration in Ma'an protesting the threat of an American attack against Iraq turned into a miniature uprising. The flags of Saudi Arabia were flown by some protesters. Jordanian Special Forces and police attempted to quell the protests, resulting in the death of a demonstrator and the injury of 25 people, including police officers. King Hussein had the Jordanian Army deployed and Ma'an was placed under curfew and had its phone lines cut. Hussein arrived in the city afterward to meet with army units and local tribal leaders in order to placate the city. He stated the \"riots\" were an insult to the country, that foreign \"infiltrators\" provoked the protests and stressed Ma'an's importance in Jordanian history, referring to the city as \"Ma'an the origin\" and \"Ma'an the history.\"\n\nMa'an was the site of clashes between the Jordanian army and Islamist groups in 2002 after the death of a US diplomat. The city has been described as a \"hotbed of IS support\" by \"The Economist\".\n\nMa'an has a cold desert climate (Köppen climate classification \"BWk\"), with hot summers and mild to cold winters due to its high altitude (above 1000 meters). Rainfall is extremely rare with an average of 44 mm a year only.\n\nIn 1845 Ma'an al-Hijaziyya had a population of 200 households and Ma'an al-Shamiyya 20 families. Karl Baedeker estimated its population to be around 3,000 in 1912 and the same number was recorded in \"Guide Bleu\"'s survey in 1932. By 1956 Ma'an's population reached 4,500 and in 1973 it was 9,500.\nIn 1961, the population of Maan was 6,643 persons. \n\nThe city had a population of 22,989 in the 1994 census. The gender makeup was 54.3% male 45.7% female. There were 4,871 housing units and 3,862 households. According to Ma'an Municipality, Ma'an's population was estimated as being about 50,000 as of 2007. The majority of the city's inhabitants are Sunni Muslims of the Hanafi school.\n\nAl-Hussein Bin Talal University is the only university in Ma'an, it offers a range of 38 undergraduate degrees, these being across the disciplines of engineering, arts, science, business administration, archaeology, education and nursing. It also offers postgraduate diplomas in education and in higher administration.\n\nMa'an is home to the Ma'an Development Area (MDA), a special economic zone with reduced income taxes, no other taxes (including taxes on income from exports), and streamlined regulatory procedures. Construction of the MDA's industrial park began in 2008 and is set to be completed in 2030. The Shams Ma'an Solar Power Plant is located in the MDA.\n\n\n"}

The local cuisine shares similarities with those of neighboring Ethiopia and other African countries in the region.\n\nEritrean cuisine shares similarities with surrounding countries' cuisines; however, the cuisine has its unique characteristics.\n\nThe main traditional food in Eritrean cuisine is tsebhi (stew), served with [[injera] (flatbread made from [[teff]], [[wheat]], or [[sorghum]] and hilbet (paste made from [[legumes]]; mainly [[lentil]] and [[Vicia faba|faba beans]]). \nA typical traditional Eritrean dish consists of [[injera]] accompanied by a spicy stew, which frequently includes beef, goat, lamb or fish. Overall, Eritrean cuisine strongly resembles that of neighboring [[Ethiopian cuisine|Ethiopia]], although Eritrean cooking tends to feature more [[seafood]] than Ethiopian cuisine on account of its coastal location. Eritrean dishes are also frequently lighter in texture than Ethiopian meals as they tend to employ less [[Niter kibbeh|seasoned butter]] and spices and more [[tomato]]es, as in \"[[tsebhi]] dorho\".\n\nAdditionally, owing to its colonial history, cuisine in Eritrea features more [[Italy|Italian]] influences than are present in Ethiopian cooking, including more [[pasta]] specials and greater use of [[curry]] powders and [[cumin]]. People in Eritrea likewise tend to drink coffee [[Christians|Christian]] Eritreans also drink \"sowa\" (a bitter fermented barley) and \"mies\" (a fermented honey beverage), while [[Muslim]] Eritreans abstain from drinking alcohol.\n\n[[File:kitcha fit fit.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Kitcha fit-fit]] is a staple of Eritrean cuisine. It consists of shredded, oiled, and spiced bread, often served with a scoop of fresh yogurt and topped with [[berbere]] (spice).]]\nWhen eating [[injera]] diners generally share food from a large tray placed in the centre of a low dining table. Numerous pieces of injera are layered on this tray and topped with various spicy stews. Diners break into the section of injera in front of them, tearing off pieces and dipping them into the stews.\n\nThe stews that accompany injera are usually made from beef, chicken, lamb, goat, mutton or vegetables. Most Eritreans, with the exception of the [[Saho people|Saho]], like their food spicy and hot. [[Berbere]], a spice mixture that consists of a variety of common and unusual herbs and spices, accompanies almost all dishes. Stews include zigni, which is made with beef; dorho tsebhi, which is made with chicken; alicha, which is a vegetable dish made without berbere; and [[Shiro (food)|shiro]], a purée of various [[legume]]s.\n\nWhen making Ga’at a ladle is used to make an indentation in the dough, which is then filled with a mixture of berbere and melted butter, and surrounded by milk or yogurt. When dining, a small piece of [[Ga'at]] is dipped into the berbere and the butter sauce, and then into the milk or yogurt.\n\nInfluenced by its past as an [[Italian Eritrea|Italian colony]], Eritrean cuisine also features unique interpretations of classic Italian dishes. Among these specialties are pasta sauces spiced with berbere.\n\n\nMost dishes common to Eritrea are either meat based or vegetable based stews that are served over the spongy, fermented bread [[Injera]]\n[[File:Sweet Asmara Caffe (8351473807).jpg|thumb|A typical cafe in [[Asmara]] selling [[Panettone]] during [[Christmas]]]]\n[[File:Macchina Gaggia.jpg|thumb|A vintage [[Gaggia]] [[espresso]] machine in a bar in [[Eritrea]]]]\n\"Suwa\" is the name for the home-brewed [[beer]] common in Eritrea.

{"id": "1799550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799550", "title": "LGBT rights in Estonia", "text": "LGBT rights in Estonia\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Estonia face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in Estonia. Since 1 January 2016, same-sex couples may register their relationship as a cohabitation agreement, which gives them almost all the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples. Nevertheless, same-sex couples are unable to marry or jointly adopt.\n\nEstonia is considered, by most, to be the most liberal former-Soviet country when it comes to LGBT rights. Acceptance of LGBT people has grown significantly since the early 21st century, though there is a notable age gap, as younger people tend to be more tolerant and liberal, while older people tend to be more socially conservative. According to ILGA-Europe, Estonia ranks 21st in Europe on LGBT rights legislation. This is lower than for neighbouring Finland or Sweden, but higher than Latvia or Russia. A 2017 opinion survey found 58% of the Estonian population supported an anti-discrimination law covering LGBT people, whilst 45% supported civil partnerships for same-sex couples.\n\nSame-sex sexual activity between consenting males, which was illegal in the Russian Empire, was legalised in Estonia with the criminal code of the Republic of Estonia in 1929. It came into force in 1935. Before the adoption of the new criminal law, the criminal and correctional penal code of Imperial Russia was observed.\n\nIn 1940 Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union. Same-sex sexual activity between males, which was illegal in the Soviet Union, was legalised in Estonia in 1992. The age of consent is 14 years and was equalized for both homosexual and heterosexual sex in 2001.\n\nIn March 2014, a parliamentary group began to work on a draft bill to regulate the legal status of cohabiting couples. The draft bill was submitted to the Parliament (Riigikogu) on 17 April 2014. On 22 May, the bill was backed by the Government. On 19 June 2014, the Parliament rejected a motion to kill the bill, in a 32–45 vote. The bill's second reading took place on 8 October where a motion to hold a referendum on the issue was defeated in a 35–42 vote and another motion to kill the bill was defeated in a 41–33 vote. The bill's final vote took place on 9 October, where it was passed 40–38. It was signed into law by President Toomas Hendrik Ilves that same day, becoming the \"Registered Partnership Act\", and took effect on 1 January 2016. The campaign against the law was led by the Christian conservative foundation For Family and Tradition.\n\nHowever, some implementing acts required for the law to enter into force have yet to be passed. On 26 November 2015, Parliament approved the first implementing acts on a vote of 42–41 with several abstentions, though nothing has happened since. In February 2017, the Tallinn Administrative Court ordered the Estonian Government to pay monetary damages for failing to adopt the implementing acts. In September 2017, President Kersti Kaljulaid criticised the Parliament for failing to accept the implementing acts.\n\nA same-sex marriage was recognised by a court in December 2016. The couple, two men who had originally married in Sweden but now live in Estonia, had their marriage officially registered in late January 2017. Initially, a court in Harju County refused to register their marriage, but the couple appealed the decision. In December, the Tallinn Circuit Court ruled that the marriage must be entered into the Estonian population register.\n\nSingle gay, lesbian and bisexual persons may petition to adopt and same-sex couples are allowed to foster. Same-sex couples cannot adopt jointly because Estonian law states that only a married couple can do so.\n\nHowever, due to the \"Registered Partnership Act\", couples are allowed to adopt stepchildren. In February 2017, the Tallinn Administrative Court allowed a lesbian woman to adopt her partner's children. There have been other cases of same-sex couples successfully adopting. Additionally, lesbian couples have access to IVF.\n\nAs an obligation for acceptance into the European Union, Estonia transposed an EU directive into its own laws banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment from 1 May 2004. The \"Law on Equal Treatment\" (), which entered into force on 1 January 2009, also prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in areas other than employment, such as health care, social security, education and the provision of goods and services. Section 2 of the law states as follows:\nSince 2006, the Penal Code has prohibited public incitement to hatred on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\nSince June 2002, transgender people in Estonia have been allowed to change their legal gender and name. Additionally, they are not required to undergo sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or divorce their partner.\n\nGays, lesbians and bisexuals are allowed to serve openly in the military.\n\nAlthough Estonia is considered to be much more liberal on LGBT rights than other Baltic states, discrimination and prejudice against LGBT persons remains widespread in most parts of Estonian society. Male homosexuality was illegal in the former Soviet Union, including Estonia, although the situation seemed to be more liberal in Estonia than in most other parts of the Baltic states. Before the Soviet occupation time in the 1st Estonian Republic era (1918-1940), same-sex sexual activity was legal. In the mid-1980s, there was an unofficial gay bar in Tallinn. There was also at least one cruising area in both Tallinn and Tartu, though outside of these two cities, the gay scene was extremely invisible. The first conference dedicated to sexual minorities took place in Tallinn in 1990. At the same time, the Estonian Lesbian Society (\"Eesti Lesbiliit\") was founded.\n\nPride parades had been organised in Tallinn from 2004 to 2007, when participants were attacked and beaten by anti-gay protesters.\n\nIn June 2006, Dutch Ambassador to Estonia Hans Glaubitz requested he be transferred to the Dutch consulate in Montreal, Canada after ongoing homophobic and racial verbal abuse being hurled against his partner, an Afro-Cuban dancer named Raúl García Lao, by citizens in the capital of Tallinn. A released statement by the Estonian authorities stated that they \"regretted the incidents very much\".\n\nFrom 6 to 12 June 2011, Estonia hosted Baltic Pride, a festival to promote greater support and awareness for LGBT people. Key speakers at the event included Riho Rahuoja, the Deputy Secretary General for Social Policy at the Ministry of Social Affairs; Christian Veske, the Chief Specialist in the Ministry's Gender Equality Department; Kari Käsper, Project Manager of the \"Diversity Enriches\" campaign from the Estonian Human Rights Centre; Hanna Kannelmäe from the Estonian Gay Youth NGO; U.S. Ambassador to Estonia Michael C. Polt; British Ambassador to Estonia Peter Carter and British photographer Clare B. Dimyon, who exhibited \"Proud of our Identity\" at Tallinn's Solaris Centre on 31 March. \"Proud of our Identity\" comprises photographs of and by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people taken at various Pride events throughout Europe, including photographs of Estonian LGBT people. Tallinn hosted the event again in 2014 and 2017.\n\nAfter the 2007 violent anti-gay attacks, no Tallinn Pride parade took place in the Estonian capital until 2017. Some 1,800 people attended the event in 2017. The pride parade also received the backing of numerous foreign embassies, including the American, British, French, German, Latvian and Lithuanian embassies, among many others.\n\nIn February 2019, LGBT association \"SevenBow\", the organizers of the Festheart LGBTI film festival, sued the Rakvere City Council for cutting its funding by 80%. The city's Cultural Affairs Committee initially endorsed the group's funding applications, but the City Council cut its funding to just a fifth of the applied sum. Lawyers argued that anti-gay views motivated the cutback. In May 2019, an administrative court ruled that the council's decision to provide less funding was unlawful, and ruled that it had no justification to give a smaller grant to SevenBow. The court added that the council had also not raised an appropriate legal basis which would have allowed it to deviate from the decision drawn up by the Cultural Affairs Committee.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted in 2000, 50% of surveyed men and 63% of women agreed with the statement \"Homosexuality among adults is a private affair of the people concerned with which officials of the law should in no way interfere\"; 29% of men and 25% of women found it hard to say what their position was.\n\nA Eurobarometer survey published in December 2006 showed that 21% of Estonians surveyed supported same-sex marriage and 14% supported the right of same-sex couples to adopt (EU-wide average: 44% and 33%, respectively).\n\nAccording to a Eurobarometer survey published in 2008, only 13 percent of Estonians professed to have homosexual friends or acquaintances, compared to a 34 percent average in the EU. However, Estonians ranked higher than the European average in willingness to grant equal opportunities to sexual minorities.\n\nA poll conducted in June 2009 showed that 32% of Estonians believed that same-sex couples should have the same legal rights as opposite-sex couples. Support was 40% among young people, but only 6% among older people.\n\nA poll conducted in September 2012 found that 34% of Estonians supported same-sex marriage and 46% supported registered partnerships (in contrast to 60% and 45% that shared the opposing stance respectively). The poll found an ethnic divide: while 51% of ethnic Estonians supported registered partnerships, only 21% of ethnic Russians were of the same view.\n\nThe same poll conducted in 2014 during the parliamentary debate on registered partnership revealed that the support dropped significantly with only 29% and 40% of respondents supporting same-sex marriage and registered partnership legislation respectively, and the level of opposition on both issues had increased to 64% and 54%.\n\nThe 2015 Eurobarometer survey showed that 44% of Estonians supported gay, lesbian and bisexual people having the same equal rights as heterosexuals, while 45% were opposed. 40% of Estonians believed there is nothing wrong with homosexual relationships and 49% disagreed, while 31% of Estonians supported same-sex marriage and 58% were against.\n\nA poll conducted between 28 March 2017 to 10 April 2017 found that, while support for same-sex registered partnership legislation was unchanged in three years (45% vs 46%), support for same-sex marriages had increased to 39% with 52% against (compared to 60% against in 2012 and 64% against in 2014). It also found that acceptance of homosexuality had increased from 34% in 2012 to 41% in 2017, with 52% against. At the same time, support for joint adoption rights remained unchanged with 66% opposing such legislation.\n\nA public opinion survey conducted in 2019 showed that 49% of Estonians supported same-sex registered partnerships and 39% opposed.\n\nThe 2019 Eurobarometer found that 41% of Estonians thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, 51% were against.\n\n"}

A lifelong royalist, he fought with the counter-revolutionary Army of Condé for two years, then joined the insurrection in France for three more years before going into exile. He was arrested after assisting the Georges Cadoudal conspiracy, but escaped to Portugal.\n\nIn 1807 he took advantage of an amnesty to rejoin the French army and served in several campaigns until 1814. He rose in rank to become a general of division. During this period, he was suspected of being an agent of the Comte d'Artois and passing information to France's enemies. Though he was notoriously anti-Napoleon and many officers did not trust him, he was employed again during the Hundred Days. Immediately after the campaign began, he deserted to the Prussian army with Napoleon's plans. King Louis XVIII of France gave him a command in the Spanish expedition of 1823.\n\nPromoted to Marshal of France, he was put in command of the Invasion of Algiers in 1830. However, after the July Revolution, he refused to recognize King Louis-Philippe of France and was sacked. After being involved in a plot against the new government, he fled to Portugal in 1832. He led the army of Dom Miguel in the Liberal Wars, and when the liberals won, he fled to Rome. He accepted another amnesty, this time in 1840, and died in France six years later.\n\nOn the eve of the French Revolution, Bourmont entered the Gardes Françaises of the French royal army but he emigrated in 1789. Bourmont served in Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Condé royalist army in the campaigns of 1792 and 1793. Then he served as chief of staff in the civil war in lower Anjou from 1794 to 1796. After fleeing to Switzerland in 1796, he took part in another insurrection from 1798-1800. He was arrested in 1801 because of involvement with Georges Cadoudal, but three years later he managed to escape to Portugal.\n\nWhen Junot invaded Portugal in 1807, Bourmont offered him his services and was employed as chief of staff of a division. Arrested when re-entering France in 1809, he was released upon the intercession of Junot and employed in the Imperial army.\n\nHe served in Italy and on the staff of Eugène de Beauharnais during the Russian campaign of 1812. Taken prisoner during the retreat from Moscow, he managed to escape and rejoin the French army. After the Battle of Lützen in 1813 he was promoted to general of brigade, he took part in the Battle of Leipzig and in 1814 he was promoted to general of division for defending Nogent-sur-Seine. After the fall of Napoleon, Bourmont rallied to the Bourbons.\n\nDuring the Hundred Days, the government of Louis XVIII of France frantically tried to stop Napoleon's march on Paris. Marshal Michel Ney was ordered to report to Besançon where he was to receive his orders from Bourmont. It irritated the proud Ney, Prince of Moscow, to take instructions from such a junior general, so he demanded to see the king. During his interview with Louis, Ney boasted to the king that he would bring back the ex-emperor in an iron cage. By the time Ney arrived in Besançon, he found that the royalist position was rapidly deteriorating and that Bourmont's assignment was to spy on him. On 11 March 1815, Ney told Bourmont that he was going over to Napoleon's camp. Shortly afterward, the Bourbon cause collapsed and Louis fled to Belgium, followed by hundreds of royalists.\n\nAccording to historian David Hamilton-Williams, the Comte d'Artois asked Bourmont to remain a royalist agent, so he requested to continue in command. The new Minister of War, Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout refused to employ Bourmont, writing to Napoleon, \"I cannot sit idly and watch this officer wear the uniform of this country; his treasonous statements concerning the Emperor are well known to all; the brigade and regimental commanders of the 14th Infantry Division despise him. Who would trust such a man?\" Nevertheless, Étienne Maurice Gérard, leader of the IV Corps vouched for him so he retained his position.\nOn the morning of 15 June, as the French Army of the North advanced into Belgium, the 14th Division led the IV Corps column of march. Near Florennes, Bourmont halted his division. On the pretence of scouting ahead, he and his staff, rode ahead with a squadron of lancers. After gaining a suitable distance from French lines, he sent the lancers back with a letter for Gérard. In the missive, he explained that he was deserting but promised, \"They will not get any information from me which will injure the French army, composed of men I love.\" He and his staff put the white Bourbon cockade on their hats and galloped for the nearest Prussian position. He immediately handed over Napoleon's operational plans to the Prussians. Gebhard von Blucher's chief of staff August von Gneisenau was pleased to receive this windfall. However, Blucher had no use for turncoats and called Bourmont a traitor to his face. When Gneisenau noted that Bourmont was wearing the white cockade, making them allies, Blucher screamed, \"Cockade be damned! A dirty dog is always a dirty dog!\"\n\nWith Napoleon's orders in their hands, the Prussians were able to take the appropriate countermeasures to gather their army. Bourmont's defection enraged the French rank and file. Though their loyalty to Napoleon was absolute, they began to suspect treachery in their generals. Étienne Hulot, who became the acting division commander, was compelled to give a speech that pledged loyalty to Napoleon and the tricolor.\n\nAfter the Battle of Waterloo and Napoleon's fall, Bourmont gave evidence that led to Ney's execution. After the Second Restoration, he was given command of the 16th infantry division in Besançon and took part in the Spanish campaign of 1823. King Charles X of France made him minister of war in 1829 and Marshal of France in 1830. He was commanding the Invasion of Algiers in 1830 when the July Revolution broke out in 1830. Bourmont refused to give his allegiance to the new King Louis Philippe and was dismissed from service.\n\nIn 1832 Marshal Bourmont took part in the rising of Caroline Ferdinande Louise, duchesse de Berry and on its failure fled to Portugal. He commanded the army of the absolutist monarch King Miguel during the Liberal Wars and after the victory of the constitutional party he retired to Rome. At the amnesty of 1840 he returned to France, where he died on 27 October 1846 at Freigné in Maine-et-Loire.\n\n"}

It has been reported in some species of banana slugs \"Ariolimax\" and in the distantly related \"Deroceras laeve\".\n\nIn the mating of banana slugs, the penis is inserted into the body of the partner. The penis may become trapped, perhaps because of the action of a special muscle, in which case the penis is gnawed off by either the partner or the owner. No replacement penis grows, but the apophallated slug can mate as a female. It has been proposed that preventing the partner from mating as a male might be adaptive in increasing its allocation of resources to the production of eggs.\n\nOne paper reports that individuals of \"Deroceras laeve\" sometimes after mating bite off their own penis, which is then eaten by the partner. In this genus, sperm is swapped from penis to penis, so the amputee would not be able to mate successfully even in the female role.\n"}

The family emigrated to the United States in 1835, and he grew up in Albany, New York where he started his career as a self-taught artist. At this early stage he was influenced by the artists of the Hudson River School. By the age of 19 he was recognised as a landscape painter and opened his first studio in 1852. In 1853, the American Art Union purchased one of his early pictures which financed six months of studying art in England. He concluded this period of his training with a sketching tour of the Lake District, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nAfter coming back to the USA, Boughton exhibited his works in Washington, D.C. and New York, but in the late 1850s he finally made a decision to move to Europe. From 1859–61 he studied art in France under Pierre Edouard Frère (1819–1886) and Edward Harrison May (1824–1887).\nIn 1861 Boughton opened a studio in London, and, although living in England, nevertheless focused on subjects of early American Colonial history, and an American critic noticed that \"for early history of this country his talents seems to be peculiarly fitted.\" His subject-pictures, such as the \"Early Puritans of New England Going to Church\" (1867), were especially popular. The \"Return of the Mayflower\" (shown at the Goupil Gallery, New York in 1871) was praised as \"a picture which will live as long as the memory of the Mayflower itself lasts.\"\n\nVincent Van Gogh, who lived London in 1873–75, was much impressed by Boughton’s painting \"Godspeed! Pilgrims Setting Out for Canterbury\". Then working as a minister, he gave a sermon inspired by the painting, and wrote about it to his brother Theo. The Boughton painting is now part of the collection of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.\n\nBoughton illustrated Nathaniel Hawthorne’s \"The Scarlet Letter\" and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poems. In 1893, the edition of Washington Irving’s \"Rip Van Winkle\" and \"Sleepy Hollow\" was published in London with 53 illustrations by Boughton (see bibliography). A London critic once declared that he \"has learnt the secret of putting natural feelings into rustic figures, which has been almost entirely wanting to English painters.\"\n\nBoughton exhibited extensively in both Britain and USA, and was elected a member of the National Academy of Design in New York in 1871. He was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) in 1879, and a Royal Academician (RA) in 1896. \"He was a useful and popular member of this body, and worked well as member of the council, as a 'hanger', and as a teacher in the schools.\" After the death of John Callcott Horsley, Boughton was elected a Director of the \"Fine Art and General Insurance Company\".\n\nAmong his landscape paintings - views of England and Brittany in France. In 1883, he travelled to Holland. His illustrated account of that journey was published in the \"Harper's Magazine\" as 'Artist Strolls in Holland', and published next year in London as \"Sketching Rambles in Holland\" (see bibliography).\n\nBoughton obviously took pleasure in writing: later he would participate in the publication of the 'English Art in the Public Galleries of London' providing the overview of George Morland's biography and work.\n\nBoughton easily socialised in London artistic circles and was a member of the Arts Club (1869–96), of the Reform Club, the Athenaeum Club, the Burlington Fine Arts Club and the Grolier and Lotos Clubs in New York.\n\nIn 1865, Boughton married Katherine Louise Cullen (1845-after 1901), and they had an adopted daughter, Florence. Along with John Callcott Horsley, he was one of the early clients of architect Richard Norman Shaw who built a house for the Boughtons on Campden Hill, London. \"The parties given here by Mr and Mrs Boughton were celebrated among artistic and literary people and in the Anglo-American section of the society.\"\n\nIt was noticed that Boughton was influenced by works of British painter and illustrator Frederick Walker (1840–1875). In the 1870s in London he met James Whistler. In 1878, an American reviewer praised them as \"shining lights in the art world\" of London. Boughton published vivid recollections about Whistler, particularly mentioning his work on the famous ‘Peacock Room'. In 1877 he made an acquaintance with Henry James (1843–1916).\n\nThe female novelist Violet Hunt (1862–1942) based her novels \"Their Lives\" (1916) and \"Their Hearts\" (1921) on her early love affair with Boughton. The novel \"Christina Chard\" (1894) by Mrs Rosa Campbell-Praed (1851–1935), an Australian novelist, was dedicated to Boughton, because he had suggested the idea of the book.\n\nIn the 1880s-1890s, he was associated with several artistic colonies in countryside, namely with the village of Broadway in Worcestershire, the rustic beauty of which was recognised by many American artists. Along with Henry James, Edwin Abbey, John Singer Sargent and others, he frequently visited Broadway. Through Horsley and Shaw he also was associated with the Cranbrook Colony of artists, visiting them in the late 1860s-1880s.\n\nBoughton died of heart disease, on January 19, 1905, in his studio at Campden Hill, north London. His obituary stated that \"he was kindly, genial, humorous, a lover of a good story, the essence of hospitality, and wholly free from jealousy, malice, and incharitable judgments.\"\n\nHis paintings are now represented in many museums in the United States and Europe.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1799584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799584", "title": "Phase-change material", "text": "Phase-change material\n\nA phase change material (PCM) is a substance which releases/absorbs sufficient energy at phase transition to provide useful heat/cooling. Generally the transition will be from one of the first two fundamental states of matter - solid and liquid - to the other. The phase transition may also be between non-classical states of matter, such as the conformity of crystals, where the material goes from conforming to one crystalline structure to conforming to another, which may be a higher or lower energy state. \n\nThe energy released/absorbed by phase transition from solid to liquid, or vice versa, the heat of fusion is generally much higher than the sensible heat. Ice, for example, requires 333.55 J/g to melt, but then water will rise one degree further with the addition of just 4.18 J/g. Water/ice is therefore a very useful phase change material and has been used to store winter cold to cool buildings in summer since at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire.\n\nBy melting and solidifying at the phase change temperature (PCT), a PCM is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy compared to sensible heat storage. Heat is absorbed or released when the material changes from solid to liquid and vice versa or when the internal structure of the material changes; PCMs are accordingly referred to as latent heat storage (LHS) materials. \n\nThere are two principal classes of phase change material: organic (carbon-containing) materials derived either from petroleum, from plants or from animals; and salt hydrates, which generally either use natural salts from the sea or from mineral deposits or are by-products of other processes. A third class is solid to solid phase change.\n\nPCMs are used in many different commercial applications where energy storage and/or stable temperatures are required, including, among others, heating pads, cooling for telephone switching boxes, and clothing. \n\nBy far the biggest potential market is for building heating and cooling. PCMs are currently attracting a lot of attention for this application due to the progressive reduction in the cost of renewable electricity, coupled with limited hours of availability, resulting in a misfit between peak demand and availability of supply. In North America, China, Japan, Australia, Southern Europe and other developed countries with hot summers peak supply is at midday while peak demand is from around 17:00 to 20:00. This creates a lot of demand for storage media.\n\nSolid-liquid phase change materials are usually encapsulated for installation in the end application, to contain in the liquid state. In some applications, especially when incorporation to textiles is required, phase change materials are micro-encapsulated. Micro-encapsulation allows the material to remain solid, in the form of small bubbles, when the PCM core has melted.\n\nLatent heat storage can be achieved through changes in the State of matter from liquid→solid, solid→liquid, solid→gas and liquid→gas. However, only solid→liquid and liquid→solid phase changes are practical for PCMs. Although liquid–gas transitions have a higher heat of transformation than solid–liquid transitions, liquid→gas phase changes are impractical for thermal storage because large volumes or high pressures are required to store the materials in their gas phase. Solid–solid phase changes are typically very slow and have a relatively low heat of transformation.\n\nInitially, solid–liquid PCMs behave like sensible heat storage (SHS) materials; their temperature rises as they absorb heat. Unlike conventional SHS materials, however, when PCMs reach their phase change temperature (their melting point) they absorb large amounts of heat at an almost constant temperature until all the material is melted. When the ambient temperature around a liquid material falls, the PCM solidifies, releasing its stored latent heat. A large number of PCMs are available in any required temperature range from −5 up to 190 °C. Within the human comfort range between 20–30 °C, some PCMs are very effective, storing over 200 kJ/kg of latent heat, as against a specific heat capacity of around one kJ/kg.°C (that is per degree Celsius) for masonry. The storage density can therefore be 200 times greater or more than masonry per kg if an exact temperature is required. If a temperature variance of, say, 4°C can be allowed, the density is 50 times greater. The specific heat capacity of water is much higher at 4.2, so the storage density of the posited PCM ranges between 50 and 12.5 times that of water.\nHydrocarbons, primarily paraffins (CH) and lipids but also one sugar alcohol.\n\n\nSalt hydrates (MNHO) \n\n\nMany natural building materials are hygroscopic, that is they can absorb (water condenses) and release water (water evaporates). The process is thus:\n\nWhilst this process liberates a small quantity of energy, large surfaces area allows significant (1–2 °C) heating or cooling in buildings. The corresponding materials are wool insulation and earth/clay render finishes.\n\nA specialised group of PCMs that undergo a solid/solid phase transition with the associated absorption and release of large amounts of heat. These materials change their crystalline structure from one lattice configuration to another at a fixed and well-defined temperature, and the transformation can involve latent heats comparable to the most effective solid/liquid PCMs. Such materials are useful because, unlike solid/liquid PCMs, they do not require nucleation to prevent supercooling. Additionally, because it is a solid/solid phase change, there is no visible change in the appearance of the PCM, and there are no problems associated with handling liquids, e.g. containment, potential leakage, etc. Currently the temperature range of solid-solid PCM solutions spans from -50 °C (-58 °F) up to +175 °C (347 °F).\n\nThe phase change material should possess the following thermodynamic properties:\n\nVolumetric heat capacity (VHC) J·m·K\n\nThermal inertia (I) = Thermal effusivity (e) J·m·K·s\n\nThe above dataset is also available as an Excel spreadsheet from UCLA Engineering\n\nThe most commonly used PCMs are salt hydrates, fatty acids and esters, and various paraffins (such as octadecane). Recently also ionic liquids were investigated as novel PCMs.\n\nAs most of the organic solutions are water-free, they can be exposed to air, but all salt based PCM solutions must be encapsulated to prevent water evaporation or uptake. Both types offer certain advantages and disadvantages and if they are correctly applied some of the disadvantages becomes an advantage for certain applications.\n\nThey have been used since the late 19th century as a medium for thermal storage applications. They have been used in such diverse applications as refrigerated transportation for rail and road applications and their physical properties are, therefore, well known.\n\nUnlike the ice storage system, however, the PCM systems can be used with any conventional water chiller both for a new or alternatively retrofit application. The positive temperature phase change allows centrifugal and absorption chillers as well as the conventional reciprocating and screw chiller systems or even lower ambient conditions utilizing a cooling tower or dry cooler for charging the TES system.\n\nThe temperature range offered by the PCM technology provides a new horizon for the building services and refrigeration engineers regarding medium and high temperature energy storage applications. The scope of this thermal energy application is wide-ranging of solar heating, hot water, heating rejection (i.e., cooling tower), and dry cooler circuitry thermal energy storage applications.\n\nSince PCMs transform between solid–liquid in thermal cycling, encapsulation naturally became the obvious storage choice.\n\n\nAs phase change materials perform best in small containers, therefore they are usually divided in cells. The cells are shallow to reduce static head – based on the principle of shallow container geometry. The packaging material should conduct heat well; and it should be durable enough to withstand frequent changes in the storage material's volume as phase changes occur. It should also restrict the passage of water through the walls, so the materials will not dry out (or water-out, if the material is hygroscopic). Packaging must also resist leakage and corrosion. Common packaging materials showing chemical compatibility with room temperature PCMs include stainless steel, polypropylene and polyolefin.\n\n\"Thermal composites\" is a term given to combinations of phase change materials (PCMs) and other (usually solid) structures. A simple example is a copper mesh immersed in paraffin wax. The copper mesh within paraffin wax can be considered a composite material, dubbed a thermal composite. Such hybrid materials are created to achieve specific overall or bulk properties.\n\nThermal conductivity is a common property targeted for maximization by creating thermal composites. In this case, the basic idea is to increase thermal conductivity by adding a highly conducting solid (such as the copper mesh) into the relatively low-conducting PCM, thus increasing overall or bulk (thermal) conductivity. If the PCM is required to flow, the solid must be porous, such as a mesh.\n\nSolid composites such as fiberglass or kevlar prepreg for the aerospace industry usually refer to a fiber (the kevlar or the glass) and a matrix (the glue, which solidifies to hold fibers and provide compressive strength). A thermal composite is not so clearly defined but could similarly refer to a matrix (solid) and the PCM, which is of course usually liquid and/or solid depending on conditions. They are also meant to discover minor elements in the earth.\n\nApplications of phase change materials include, but are not limited to:\n\n\nSome phase change materials are suspended in water, and are relatively nontoxic. Others are hydrocarbons or other flammable materials, or are toxic. As such, PCMs must be selected and applied very carefully, in accordance with fire and building codes and sound engineering practices. Because of the increased fire risk, flamespread, smoke, potential for explosion when held in containers, and liability, it may be wise not to use flammable PCMs within residential or other regularly occupied buildings. Phase change materials are also being used in thermal regulation of electronics.\n\n\nZafer URE M.Sc., C.Eng. MASHRAE HVAC Applications\nZafer URE M.Sc., C.Eng.

He was born and died in Paris.\nBouhours entered the Society of Jesus at the age of sixteen, and was appointed to read lectures on literature in the Collège de Clermont at Paris, and on rhetoric at Tours and Rouen. He afterwards became private tutor to the two sons of Henri II d'Orléans, duc de Longueville.\n\nHe was sent to Dunkirk to the Romanist refugees from the Commonwealth of England, and in the midst of his missionary occupations published several books. In 1665 or 1666 he returned to Paris, and published in 1671 \"Les Entretiens d'Ariste et d'Eugène\", which was reprinted four more times at Paris, twice at Grenoble, and afterwards at Lyon, Brussels, Amsterdam, Leiden and other cities. The work consists of six conversations (\"entretiens\") between two companionable friends whose Greek- and Latin-derived names both mean \"well-born\", in the agreeable discursive manner of the well-informed amateur as it had become established in the salons— \"the free and familiar conversations that well-bred people have (\"honnêtes gens\", a by-word of the \"précieuses\" of the salons) when they are friends, and which do not fail to be witty, and even knowledgeable, though one never dreams there of making wit show, and study has no part in it.\" The subjects, erudite but devoid of pedantry, are the Sea, considered as an object of contemplation, the French language, Secrets, True Wit (\"Le Bel Esprit\"), The Ineffable (\"Le Je ne sais quoi\") and Mottoes (\"Devises\"), all expressed in flawless idiom and effortless allusions to the Classics or Torquato Tasso. The popularity of Bouhours' discursive, heuristic \"Entretiens\" extended to Poland, where Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski imitated them in \"Dialogues of Artakses and Ewander.\"\n\nHis thoughts on the elusive \"je ne sais quoi\" that was in vogue in the seventeenth century, expressed through his characters, ends in assessing it a mystery that escapes a rational inquiry. It determined by its delicate presence, its grace and invisible charm, the sense of what pleases or displeases in Nature as well as Art, and remained an essential part of the French critical vocabulary until the advent of Romanticism.\n\nHis \"Doutes sur la langue française proposés aux Messieurs de l'Académie française\" (Paris, 1674; corrected second edition, 1675) was called \"the most important and best organized of his numerous commentaries on the literary language of his time\" when it was edited in a critical edition. His \"doubts\" are collected under five headings: vocabulary, phrases and collocations, grammatical constructions, clarity, and stylistic consistency, in each case setting literary quotations under scrutiny. His standards, expressed in the suggestions he offered for improving each example, showed the way out of ambiguities, skirting incongruous juxtapositions and untidy constructions. The work was widely accepted and Bouhours standards are still the accepted norm among literate readers today.\n\nThe chief of his other works are \"La Manière de bien penser sur les ouvrages d'esprit\" (1687), which appeared in London in 1705 under the title, \"The Art of Criticism\", \"Vie de Saint Ignace de Loyola\" (1679), \"Vie de Saint François Xavier\" (1682), and a translation of the New Testament into French (1697). His letters against the Jansenists had a wide circulation. His practice of publishing secular books and works of devotion alternately led to the mot, \"qu'il servait le monde et le ciel par semestre\". Bouhours died at Paris in 1702.\n\nAccording to the book \"Mother Tongue\" by Bill Bryson, Bouhours' dying words were \"I am about to -- or I am going to -- die: either expression is correct.\"\n\n\n"}

In the Evangelical Lutheran tradition he is known as \"Alter Martinus,\" the \"Second Martin\": \"Si Martinus non fuisset, Martinus vix stetisset\" (\"If Martin [Chemnitz] had not come along, Luther would hardly have survived\") goes a common saying concerning him. He is listed and remembered in the Calendar of Saints and Commemorations in the Liturgical Church Year as a pastor and confessor in the \"Lutheran Book of Worship\" (1978) and subsequent \"Evangelical Lutheran Worship\" (2005) used by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.\n\nChemnitz, born in Treuenbrietzen in Brandenburg to Paul and Euphemia Chemnitz, was the last of three children. His older siblings' names were Matthew and Ursula. His father was a successful merchant who died when Martin was eleven: thereafter, the family suffered from financial difficulties.\n\nWhen he was old enough, Martin matriculated in Magdeburg. Upon completion of the course work, he became a weaver's apprentice. He helped his family with its clothing business for the next few years. When he was 20, he resumed his education at the University of Frankfurt (Oder). He remained in school until his finances were exhausted; he then took a teaching job in the town of Wriezen, supplementing his income by collecting the local sales tax on fish. His time at Frankfurt gave him the basic tools to continue his education on his own, researching areas in which he was interested and applying his naturally inquisitive mind to problems that others had worried over in the past.\n\nIn 1545 Chemnitz accompanied his cousin Georg Sabinus to school at the University of Wittenberg in Wittenberg, Germany (1545–1547), where he studied under Martin Luther (1483-1546) and Philip Melanchthon (1497-1560). From Melanchthon he learned to shape his theological education, beginning with the difference between \"law\" and \"gospel\". In Chemnitz's words, though he heard Luther lecture often, he \"did not pay Luther the attention he should have.\" (cf. Autobiography) Because of Luther's death and political events, Chemnitz transferred to the University of Königsberg (1547–1548). Chemnitz graduated in the first class with a Master of Arts degree (1548). However, a plague soon infested the Baltic Sea Hanseatic German port town of Königsberg in East Prussia, (today renamed Kaliningrad since occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945 at the end of World War II, now annexed into the Russian Federation) so Chemnitz left quickly for Saalfeld. When he judged it safe, Chemnitz returned to Königsberg in 1550, now employed by Albert, Duke of Prussia, as the court librarian for the Konigsberg State and University Library. In return for caring for the library and teaching a few courses as a tutor, he had unrestricted access to what was then considered one of the finest libraries in Europe (and unfortunately later damaged and lost with its contents and elaborate building 400 years later during the battles swirling around the Prussian city on the Eastern Front of the Second World War in 1944-1945).\n\nFor the first time Chemnitz applied himself completely to theological study. During these years his interest shifted from astrology, which he had studied in Magdeburg, to theology. He began his own course of study by carefully working through the Bible in the original languages of Hebrew and Ancient Greek with the goal of answering questions that had previously puzzled him. When he felt ready to move on, he turned his attention to the early theologians of the Church, whose writings he read slowly and carefully. Then he turned to current theological concerns, again reading slowly while painstakingly making copious notes. This early method of Lutheran scholastic self-study had been suggested by Melanchthon in his Writings (cf. Autobiography).\n\nChemnitz moved back to Wittenberg in 1553 as a guest of Melanchthon. In January 1554 he joined the Wittenberg University faculty. He lectured on Melanchthon's \"Loci Communes\", from which lectures he compiled his own \"Loci Theologici,\" a system of theology. He was ordained to the ministry on 26 November 1554 by Johannes Bugenhagen (1485-1558), and became co-adjutor of Joachim Mörlin (1514-1571), who was ecclesiastical superintendent for the Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. When Mörlin resigned in 1567, Chemnitz became his successor; he held the post for the rest of his life.\n\nThrough his leadership, Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel was brought firmly into Evangelical Lutheranism. There he helped his prince, Duke Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, establish the University of Helmstedt (1575–76). With Jakob Andreae, David Chytraeus, Nicholas Selnecker, Andrew Musculus and others, Chemnitz took part in a centrist movement that brought agreement among German Lutherans in the writing and publication of the \"Formula of Concord\" (1577), of which Chemnitz is one of the primary authors. He was instrumental in the publication of the definitive \"Book of Concord: Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church\" presented in 1580, containing a series of important earlier confessional theological documents, treatises, commentaries, catechisms as the compilation of the doctrinal standard of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Other major works are \"Examen Concilii Tridentini\" (\"Examination of the Council of Trent\") and \"De Duabis Naturis in Christo\" (\"On the Two Natures in Christ\"). These works demonstrate Martin Chemnitz's abilities as a biblical, doctrinal and historical theologian in the orthodox Lutheran tradition. He died in Braunschweig.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The programme is presented by a puppet named Pob (played by puppeteer Robin Stevens), who speaks Welsh and who supposedly lives inside the viewer's TV (the casing and red, green and blue electron guns visible behind him). Music was composed and performed by Mike Stanley. The opening titles of the show consist of the character breathing on the camera lens (this breathing was often mistaken for spitting, given the loud noise accompanying it and the thick condensation appearing on screen), and tracing his name in the condensation. Each week on the programme, a celebrity guest visits Pob's garden, and entertains him — though Pob and the guest never appear on screen together.\n\n\"Pob's Programme\" was created by Doug Wilcox and Anne Wood of Ragdoll Productions, which also created \"Rosie and Jim\". Wood went on to create the \"Teletubbies\".\n\nIn a typical episode, the celebrity visitor to the show finds a label attached to a piece of string on the gates of Pob's garden;\n\nThe celebrity guest then follows the woollen string, winding it as they go, and encountering a second label;\n\nUltimately the wool is found to be Pob's unravelled jumper, and he is awoken to trace his name on the screen. Over the course of the programme, the celebrity guest reads a story, and solves a word puzzle with Pob.\n\nOver 24 celebrity visitors appeared on \"Pob's Programme\" like Nigel Hayes, some appearing twice. The visitors, many of them well known as actors, included Roy Castle, Jan Francis, Charlie Williams, Madhur Jaffrey, Brian Blessed, Hannah Gordon, Su Pollard, Kathy Staff, Spike Milligan and Toyah Willcox. One episode was filmed on location at Birmingham Children's Hospital with Polly James as a patient.\n\nVarious celebrities had recurring segments on \"Pob's Programme\", including Nigel Kennedy (who would attempt to teach Pob to play the violin), Dick King-Smith (who would follow nature trails based on clues that Pob would send him), Alan Dart (who would be seen, hands only, doing a different handicraft project each episode) and Rod Campbell (who would devise different ways to open a mystery box).\n\nPob was often accompanied in his mischief by a silent teddy bear called Teddy, operated by Bob Berk and Wanda Szajna-Hopgood.\n\nIn 2001, \"Pob's Programme\" was number 60 on Channel 4's \"100 Greatest Kids' TV shows\".\n"}

She was convicted on the strength of letters written by her dead lover and a confession obtained by torture, so her guilt remains uncertain.\n\nAccording to the charges laid against her in 1675, in 1666 Marie-Madeleine-Marguerite de Brinvilliers had conspired with her lover, Captain Godin de Sainte-Croix, also called the Chevalier de Sainte Croix, to poison her father Antoine Dreux d'Aubray, and in 1670 she had likewise killed two of her brothers, Antoine and François d'Aubray, in order to inherit their estates. Her alleged accomplice Sainte-Croix had died of natural causes in 1672, so could not be charged. There were also rumors that Brinvilliers had poisoned poor people during her visits to hospitals, but she was not charged with any such killings.\n\nThe charges against Brinvilliers originated from diaries and letters found in the possession of Sainte Croix after his death, contained in a red leather box which he had marked as not to be opened until after the death of Brinvilliers. She was accused of using Tofana poison and was reported to have learned how to make it from Sainte Croix, who had himself learned the method from Exili, an Italian prisoner who had been his cellmate in the Bastille.\n\nIn 1675, on being accused, Brinvilliers fled to England, the Netherlands, and finally, a convent near Liège, where she was arrested by a policeman pretending to be a priest. On 17 July 1676, she was tortured with the water cure, that is, made to drink sixteen pints of water (more than 7 liters) and forced to confess. On the strength of the documents left behind by Sainte Croix and her own confession she was sentenced to death, despite the objections of her defense counsel that there was no good evidence for her guilt. She was then beheaded, and her body was burned. \n\nHer trial and the scandal which followed it launched the Affair of the Poisons, which saw several French aristocrats charged with witchcraft and poisoning.\n\nFictional accounts of her life include \"The Leather Funnel\" by Arthur Conan Doyle, \"The Marquise de Brinvilliers\" by Alexandre Dumas, père, \"The Devil's Marchioness\" by William Fifield, and \"Intrigues of a Poisoner\" by Émile Gaboriau. In her 1836 poem , Letitia Elizabeth Landon envisages the poisoning of a discarded lover. Robert Browning's 1846 poem \"The Laboratory\" imagines an incident in her life. Her capture and burning is mentioned in \"The Oracle Glass\" by Judith Merkle Riley, also the poisoning of the poor is echoed by the main character, Genevieve's, mother. The plot of the novel \"The Burning Court\" by John Dickson Carr concerns a murder that appears to be the work of the ghost of Marie d'Aubray Brinvilliers.\n\nThere have been two musical treatments of her life. An opera titled \"La marquise de Brinvilliers\" with music by nine composers—Daniel Auber, Désiré-Alexandre Batton, Henri Montan Berton, Giuseppe Marco Maria Felice Blangini, François-Adrien Boieldieu, Michele Carafa, Luigi Cherubini, Ferdinand Hérold, and Ferdinando Paer—premiered at the Paris Opéra-Comique in 1831. A musical comedy called \"Mimi - A Poisoner's Comedy\" written by Allen Cole, Melody A. Johnson, and Rick Roberts premiered in Toronto, Canada in September 2009.\n\nThe \"Sailor Moon\" musical \"Kessen / Transylvania no Mori (Kaiteiban)\", included a character known as De Brinvilliers-sensei. She was a vampire who posed as a chemistry teacher who tested her students about various poisons.\n\nMargarita Blankenheim, a character in the \"Evillious Chronicles\" based on the Vocaloid Hatsune Miku, was based after the woman. A song by mothy sung by Hatsune Miku known as \"Gift from the Princess who Brought Sleep\" describes Margarita's actions.\n\nThe 2009 French television film \"The Marquise of Darkness\" (French: \"La Marquise des Ombres\") starred Anne Parillaud as de Brinvilliers.\n\n\n"}

He was a schoolfellow of Gustave Flaubert, to whom he dedicated his first work, \"Miloenis\" (1851), a narrative poem in five cantos, dealing with Roman manners under the emperor Commodus. His volume of poems entitled \"Fossiles\" attracted considerable attention, on account of the attempt therein to use science as a subject for poetry. These poems were included also in \"Festons et astragales\" (1859).\n\nAs a dramatist he secured a success with his first play, \"Madame de Monlarcy\" (1856), which ran for seventy-eight nights at the Odéon; and \"Hélène Peyron\" (1858) and \"L'Oncle Million\" (1860) were also favorably received. But of his other plays, some of them of real merit, only the \"Conjuration d'Amboise\" (1866) met with any great success. Bouilhet died on 18 July 1869, at Rouen. Flaubert published his posthumous poems with a notice of the author, in 1872.\n\nBouilhet was Flaubert's mentor and guide, and Flaubert never wrote anything without his advice. A few months after Bouilhet's death in 1869 Flaubert wrote: \"When I lost my poor Bouilhet, I lost my midwife, the man who saw more clearly into my mind than I did myself.\" Starkie quotes Maxime Du Camp who knew them both well as saying that \"it was Bouilhet who was the master, in the matter of literature at least, and that it was Flaubert who obeyed.\" Throughout their lives, Flaubert referred to Bouilhet as \"Monseigneur.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1799621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799621", "title": "LGBT rights in Ukraine", "text": "LGBT rights in Ukraine\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexuals, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Ukraine may face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Noncommercial, same-sex sexual activity between consenting adults in private is legal in Ukraine, but prevailing social attitudes are often described as being intolerant of LGBT people and households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for any of the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples.\n\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union and Ukraine's independence in 1991, the Ukrainian LGBT community has gradually become more visible and more organized politically, organising several LGBT events in Kiev, Odessa, Kharkiv and Kryvyi Rih. These events have been marred by violent attacks by nationalist groups and cancellation by authorities. Most Ukrainians affiliate with the Eastern Orthodox Church, which has a significant influence on the perception of society towards members of the LGBT community. The Orthodox Church has opposed LGBT events and groups, often in the name of \"combatting immorality\", and has even encouraged violent attacks. As such, many LGBT people in Ukraine report feeling the need to lie about their true sexual orientation or gender identity in order to avoid being a target of discrimination or violent harassment. Several politicians have proposed suppressing freedom of speech and freedom of assembly for LGBT people, by enacting so-called \"anti-propaganda\" laws.\n\nIn a 2010 European study, 28% of Ukrainians polled believed that LGBT individuals should live freely and how ever they like. A 2017 poll found that 56% of Ukrainians believed that gay and bisexual individuals should enjoy equal rights, marking a significant shift in public opinion. Attitudes are becoming more accepting, in line with worldwide trends. In 2015, the Ukrainian Parliament approved an employment anti-discrimination law covering sexual orientation and gender identity, and in 2016 Ukrainian officials simplified the transition process for transgender people and began allowing gay and bisexual men to donate blood. Ukraine's desire to join the European Union has strongly impacted its approach to LGBT rights. The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association has ranked Ukraine 36th out of 49 European countries in terms of LGBT rights legislation, similarly to EU members Lithuania and Romania.\n\nAs part of the Soviet Union, the Criminal Code banned same-sex sexuality. In 1991, the law was revised so as to better protect the right to privacy. Today, the law only concerns itself with same-sex sexual activity when it involves prostitution with persons under the legal age of consent or public conduct that is deemed to be in violation of public decency standards.\n\nArticle 51 of the Constitution specifically defines marriage as a voluntary union between a man and a woman. No legal recognition exists for same-sex marriage, nor is there any sort of more limited recognition for same-sex couples.\n\nOn 23 November 2015, the Government approved an action plan to implement the National Strategy on human rights in the period up to 2020, which include the promise to draft a bill creating registered civil partnerships for opposite-sex and same-sex couples by 2017, among others. However, in early 2018, the Ministry of Justice stated that \"the development and submission to the Government of a draft law on the legalization of a registered civil partnership in Ukraine cannot be implemented\" due to \"numerous appeals from the regional councils, the and other religious organizations\".\n\nIn June 2018, the Justice Ministry confirmed that currently \"there is no legal grounds\" for same-sex marriage and civil partnerships in Ukraine.\n\nSingle persons who are citizens of Ukraine regardless of sexual orientation are allowed to adopt, but same-sex couples are explicitly banned from adoption (Clause 211 of Family Code of Ukraine). Additionally, the adopter must be at least 15 years older than the adopted child, or 18 years older if adopting an adult. The law also mentions that persons \"whose interests conflict with the interests of the child\" may not be adopters, but whether this provision has ever been applied against gay adopters is unknown.\n\nAdditional restrictions are placed on foreign adopters. Only couples married in a registered different-sex marriage are allowed to adopt children from Ukraine.\n\nHowever, lesbian couples are given more access to parenting than men, as IVF and assisted insemination treatments are legal.\n\nAfter having failed to gain enough votes on 5 and 9 November 2015, the Ukrainian Parliament approved an amendment to the Labor Code () banning sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination at work on 12 November 2015. A similar law (that law would have barred employers from rejecting workers based on their sexual orientation) was indefinitely postponed on 14 May 2013. The law passed on 12 November 2015 was an EU requirement for Ukraine to move forward in its application for visa-free travel to the Schengen Area. Before the vote of the bill, Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Volodymyr Groysman strongly spoke out against same-sex marriage.\n\nThere is a national hate crimes law that could be interpreted as including sexual orientation and gender identity, but that has not been decided by the courts.\n\nIn November 2016, the Ukrainian Parliament refused to back the Istanbul Convention, a European domestic violence treaty, because its references to sexual orientation and gender violated what many Ukrainian lawmakers said were basic Christian values. The Convention is aimed at combatting domestic violence against women.\n\nTranssexuality is classified as a psychiatric disorder. Sex reassignment surgery is legal in Ukraine, but is permissible for those over the age of 25 years only.\n\nIn 2011, the Ukrainian Civil Code was amended and allowed for transgender persons who have undergone surgery to change their name to better reflect their gender identity. In 2014, seven people had sex changes and five people received new documentation.\n\nSince December 2016, new identity documents are issued before surgery is conducted. This followed an August 2016 ruling, which ordered changes requested by two transgender people to their passports and all other documents without requiring them to undergo surgery. What's more, people with a child younger than 18 years old and married people can now also apply to transition. Previously, all applicants needed permission from a special commission of the Ministry of Healthcare and needed to spend 30 days in a psychiatric hospital (usually placed in the same wards with patients who are mentally ill) and needed to be diagnosed with \"transsexuality\". This is no longer required.\n\nMilitary service for men is compulsory in Ukraine. According to law, homosexuality is not a reason for exemption from the army. However, many young gay men try to avoid call-up to military service as they are afraid to face unauthorized relations and other difficulties. Additionally, women are also allowed to serve.\n\nIn April 2016, the Ukrainian Ministry of Health enacted new regulations governing blood donation, allowing gay and bisexual men to donate blood. Previously, the Ministry of Health listed \"homosexuality\" as a risky behaviour for which donors could not give blood.\n\nGay and bisexual sexual orientations and transgender identity remain taboo subjects in Ukraine. Most Ukrainians affiliated with the Orthodox or Catholic Church tend to view homosexuality and non-traditional gender roles as signs of immorality. Prior to the 25 May 2013 Kiev pride parade, the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Filaret, stated that people supporting LGBT rights would be cursed and Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church denounced homosexuality as a sin tantamount to manslaughter.\n\nBeyond the traditional religious teachings, most Ukrainians grew up with little, if any, comprehensive, fact-based public education about human sexuality in general, let alone sexual orientation and gender identity. The lack of sex education promotes the view of homosexuals as a dangerous social group, as a source of sexually transmitted diseases, especially HIV/AIDS.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, non-heterosexual sexual relations were labelled as abnormal. Some remnants of the Soviet mentality, which sees sexual topics as taboo and even denies their existence, still exist today.\n\nToday, there are frequent reports of harassment, even violence directed at LGBT people in Ukraine. Many LGBT people in Ukraine report feeling the need to lie about their true sexual orientation or gender identity in order to avoid being a target for discrimination or violent harassment. Bias motivated crimes or hate crimes against people who are LGBT are frequently reported on in the international press, and while such violence is not legal in Ukraine, there is a perception by people living in Ukraine and globally that such violence is frequently tolerated by the Government. The Ukrainian police hardly ever detained attackers. The prevailing intolerance and threats of violence, pressure many LGBT people to remain in the closet, especially if they are public figures who feel that their career as a politician or a celebrity would end if people knew that they are part of the LGBT community.\n\nWhile prevailing public attitudes are intolerant, the Ukrainian LGBT community has gradually become more visible and more organized politically since 1991. Much of this is still restricted to low-key events in urban cities such as Kyiv, but the issue of LGBT rights in Ukraine has been publicly debated much more, largely as the result of the actions of right-wing nationalists and social conservatives to classify any positive depictions of LGBT people or LGBT rights as being pornographic.\n\nOne of the major movement in opposition to LGBT rights in Ukraine is the \"ex-gay\" movement which believes that lesbian, gay or bisexual sexual orientations, or transgender identities, can be \"cured\" through therapeutic or religious programs. The largest of these groups in Ukraine is \"Love Against Homosexuality\", who believe that LGBT people are \"sexual perverts\" who need to be cured. The organization laments the \"discrimination of heterosexuals\".\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals have complained about an increase of attacks in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in Eastern Ukraine. On 8 June 2014, ten armed people attacked the gay club Babylon in the city of Donetsk. They fired blank cartridges into the air for intimidation and declared that there should not be gay clubs in the city, after which they robbed the visitors. In 2015, the Deputy Minister for Political Affairs of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic stated: \"A culture of homosexuality is spreading… This is why we must kill anyone who is involved in this.\" Many volunteers that took in refugees from territories controlled by the Donetsk People's Republic refused to host LGBT people.\n\nIn 1999, the former President of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, stated that there are more important issues than LGBT rights to discuss in Parliament and that homosexuality is caused by a mental illness or the corrupting influence of foreign films.\n\nIn 2007, the leader of the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights called gay men \"perverts\" who must be stopped. Other MPs, namely Communist MP Leonid Grach, have listed homosexuality and lesbianism as evils the state must stop.\n\nA draft law that would make it illegal to talk about homosexuality in public and in the media and to import, distribution and broadcast of video, photo and audio products that \"encourages homosexuality\" (with penalties of up to five years in prison and fines for up to 5,000 Ukrainian hryvnia (616 United States dollars)) was passed in first reading in the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) on 2 October 2012. An estimated 20 community activists representing several organizations protested outside of the Verkhovna Rada building during the vote. On 4 October 2012, a second vote was tentatively scheduled for 16 October. This law was deemed homophobic by the LGBT community and human rights organisations and condemned by Amnesty International, the European Union and the United Nations. The Venice Commission concluded in June 2013 that the bill was \"incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and international human rights standards\". In January 2015, the bill was removed from the agenda.\n\nA petition was subsequently started by anti-gay groups, calling for \"measures to be taken to stop the propaganda of homosexuality and for defending family values\". In March 2018, Ukraine's Anti-Discrimination Ombudsperson removed the petition from the electronic petitions section. By then, the petition had received 23,000 signatures and support from various religious organisations. The Ombudsman described the petition as \"anti-freedom\", and deleted it due to \"containing calls to restrict human rights\".\n\nIn 1998, the first LGBT rights group was created. Our World () is an LGBT community center and human rights advocacy organization. In 2008, Ukrainian LGBT rights organizations came together to create a coalition, the Union of Gay Organizations of Ukraine (Рада ЛГБТ-організацій України). The Gay Alliance of Ukraine (Гей-альянс Україна) was founded in 2009.\n\nIn September 2003, the first, albeit small, public pride parade was held in Kyiv.\n\nIn May 2008, Ukrainian LGBT groups were prevented from marking the International Day Against Homophobia after a last-minute intervention by authorities who told organisers that due to the likelihood of friction the events would have to be cancelled. Roman Catholics, Evangelic Christians, Seventh-day Adventists, Eparchy of Christianity and Baptist and the Union of Independent Orthodox churches had asked local authorities to forbid any action by representatives of sexual minorities.\n\nA May 2012, a Kyiv gay pride parade was canceled by its participants because they feared for their safety. Two gay rights activists were beaten up and tear gassed by a group of youths after pridegoers were evacuated by police escort.\n\nOn 23 May 2013, a Ukrainian court satisfied a petition by Kyiv city authorities to ban the holding of any events, other than those envisaged by the program for the celebration of Kiev Day (in the central part of the city); in doing so it \"de facto\" banned the gay pride parade in Kyiv that was planned for 25 May. The pride event was then changed to \"a private event outside of the central part of Kiev\". On this day on a narrow pathway near Pushkin Park and Shuliavska metro station, about 50 people gathered and marched. Among them, at least 10 were from Munich (Germany), including Vice Mayor Hep Monatzeder, and some were from Sweden. They marched under the protection of 1,500 policemen, 13 of the about 100 anti-gay protesters were arrested and no physical violence occurred. After one hour, the protesters who took part in the parade were evacuated from the area. In an attempt to avoid revenge attacks, they then changed their clothes and switched modes of transport multiple times.\n\nA procession organised by gay rights activists took place in central Kyiv on 11 January 2014; amidst the Euromaidan-protests.\n\nThe Kyiv gay pride parade was again cancelled on 5 July 2014 after the police failed to guarantee its protection. It would have been a small, closed march several kilometers outside Kyiv. The Love Against Homosexuality movement demanded its cancellation. On 7 July 2014, Mayor of Kiev Vitali Klitschko had asked to cancel the pride, \"I think that currently, when battle actions take place and many people die, holding entertainment events does not match the situation existing. And I am urging all these people not to do this. I think that this will be wrong amid these circumstances\". The \"battle actions\" Klitschko referred to was the post-ceasefire government offensive of the War in Donbass. On 6 June 2015, Ukraine's second pride parade was held. The march was finished in less than half an hour. The number of police protection far outnumbered the pride participants. The venue for the march was only disclosed to the march's participants that had registered on its website. During the march, five policemen were injured in scuffles after unidentified people had attacked the rally with smoke bombs and stones. One police officer was admitted to intensive care. 25 anti-gay activists were arrested. Members of Parliament Svitlana Zalishchuk and Serhiy Leshchenko attended the march along with the Swedish Ambassador to Ukraine, Andreas von Beckerath, and other Western diplomats. The organizers urged the pride participants to disperse in small groups and not to use the Kiev Metro. On 4 June 2015, Kiev Mayor Klitschko had again asked to cancel the pride citing \"danger of provocations\". On the other hand, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko stated on 5 June 2015 that there was no reason to prevent the march.\n\nOn 12 June 2016, Ukraine's third pride parade, dubbed the Equality March, was held in Kyiv without incidents. The march of 1,500 people lasted about half an hour and was guarded by more than 5,500 police officers and 1,200 members of the National Guard. 57 people were detained for aggressive behavior. On 18 June 2017, Kiev's fourth pride parade, again dubbed Equality March, was held in the city without major incidents with 6 people detained for trying to breach the security cordon. On 17 June 2018, Kiev's fifth pride parade was held in the city centre. It lasted less than one hour and was, according to Kiev police attended by 3,500 people, while the organizers said there were at least 5,000 participants. No serious incidents occurred during the march. Clashes did break out when 150 far-right protesters who tried to block off the route were dispersed by riot police. 57 protesters were detained.\n\nOn 13 August 2016, an LGBT Equality March was held in Odessa. The march of 50 people lasted about half an hour and was guarded by more than 700 police officers. Twenty men, who were trying to break through to the event, were detained.\n\nIn May 2017, LGBT activists organised a rally in the city of Kharkiv. 30 people attacked the participants and police officers, injuring two.\n\nIn June 2019, an estimated 8,000 people marched at the Kyiv Pride parade, among them politicians and foreign diplomats. The event was peaceful. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who took office in May 2019, urged the police to prevent violence and safeguard the safety of the participants.\n\nIn August 2019, about 300 people took part in the LGBT Equality March in Odessa. A number of diplomatic missions took part, as well as guests from Canada, Germany, the United States and other countries. Some small clashes were reported. The marchers were protected by 500 police officers, who arrested 3 people for minor hooliganism.\n\nIn September 2019, an estimated 2,000 people participated in Kharkiv's first pride march. The march went forward despite Mayor Hennadiy Kernes threatening to file legal action against the organizers. At the end of the march, clashes between the police and anti-pride march right-wing demonstrators saw two police agents being treated for pepper spray-related injuries. After the march ended, far-right counterdemonstrators gathered in Shevchenko park hoping to attack LGBT activists attempting to leave on foot. One march participant had to be rescued by a press photographer.\n\nOn 22 June 2012, a man approached LGBT activist Taras Karasiichuk saying, \"Are you a fag?\" and then kicked him in the head and jaw. Human Rights Watch said authorities should treat the incident as a hate crime.\n\nAn Amnesty International expert on Ukraine stated in 2013 that \"people have been beaten and in one case murdered because of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. Most of these crimes have not been properly investigated and have gone unpunished.\"\n\nOn 6 July 2014, a group of 15-20 neo-Nazis mounted an attack against the gay club \"Pomada\" (Lipstick) in Kyiv. The attackers wore camouflage and balaclava (ski masks) and threw a smoke grenade and firecrackers.\n\nOn 29 October 2014, Kyiv's oldest movie theater, , caught fire when a smoke grenade was thrown into it during the screening of the French film \"Summer Nights\", which was shown as part of an LGBT program at the Molodist Film Festival. None of the roughly hundred people attending were injured. Police arrested two suspects, one of whom said that the intent was not to burn the building down, but to make a protest against films with an LGBT theme.\n\nOleksandr Zinchenko, an Our World representative, stated on 3 June 2015 that 40 hate crimes had been committed against LGBT people in 2014 and that about 10 such crimes had already happened in 2015.\n\nGay people are being actively persecuted in the separatist-controlled areas of Donbass.\n\nIn a 2007 country-wide survey by the Institute of Sociology, 16.7% disagreed strongly and 17.6% disagreed with the following statement: \"Gay men and lesbians should be free to live their own life as they wish\". Only 30.2% \"agreed strongly\" and \"agreed\" with the statement. That was the lowest rating of \"agreed strongly\" and \"agreed\" with the statement of 24 countries investigated.\n\nIn a December 2007 survey by Angus Reid Global Monitor, 81.3% of Ukrainians polled said that homosexual relations were \"never acceptable\", 13% answered \"sometimes acceptable\" and 5.7% \"acceptable\". Of all the behaviors listed, homosexuality was viewed as the third worst after shoplifting and drunk driving. Notably, more people viewed this as never acceptable than adultery (61.5% never, 29.3% sometimes), traffic rule violation (70.2% never, 25.6% sometimes), pollution (73.3% never, 22.4% sometimes), tax evasion (48.5% never, 37.5% sometimes), deception for the sake of profit (48.3% never, 41.6% sometimes), as well as a list of other things including abortion, premarital sex, complaining to authorities about a friend who has stolen something, etc.\n\nIn another Angus Reid Global Monitor survey, this one in June 2007, on a long list of possible social reforms in the country, legalization of same-sex marriage only received 4.7% of the vote, the lowest by far (the next lowest being light drugs, at 7.1%).\n\nA December 2010 Gorshenin Institute poll stated that the \"Ukrainian attitude to sexual minorities\" was \"entirely negative\" for 57.5%, \"rather negative\" for 14.5%, \"rather positive\" for 10% and \"quite positive\" for 3%.\n\nA May 2013 poll by GfK Ukraine found that 4.6% of respondents were in favour of same-sex marriage and 16% supported other forms of recognition, while 79.4% were opposed to any form of recognition.\n\nA summer 2015 survey by the British Council revealed that one in five of Ukrainian youth would be uncomfortable with having lesbian and gay people as friends.\n\nAccording to a 2015–16 survey by the Pew Research Center, 86% of Ukrainian respondents believed that homosexuality should not be accepted by society. \n\nOn 25 September 2016, European scientific studies detected that Ukrainians displayed higher levels of homophobia than Albanians and Italians, confirming the central role of cultural differences in homophobic attitudes.\n\nA Pew Research Center poll published in May 2017 suggested that 9% of Ukrainians were in favor of same-sex marriage, while 85% opposed it. According to the poll, younger people were more likely than their elders to favor legal same-sex marriage (11% vs. 7%).\n\nAccording to a 2017 poll carried out by ILGA, 56% of Ukrainians agreed that gay, lesbian and bisexual people should enjoy the same rights as straight people, while 21% disagreed. Additionally, 59% agreed that they should be protected from workplace discrimination. 20% of Ukrainians, however, said that people who are in same-sex relationships should be charged as criminals, while 55% disagreed. As for transgender people, 60% agreed that they should have the same rights, 58% believed they should be protected from employment discrimination and a plurality of 43% believed they should be allowed to change their legal gender.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1799643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799643", "title": "Kadazan people", "text": "Kadazan people\n\nThe Kadazans are an ethnic group indigenous to the state of Sabah in Malaysia. They are found mainly in Penampang on the west coast of Sabah, the surrounding locales, and various locations in the interior.\n\nAs a result of integration in culture and language, as well as for political initiatives, the new term \"Kadazan-Dusun\" was created to combine them. Together, they are the largest ethnic group in Sabah. Kadazan-Dusun has been recognized as an indigenous nation of Borneo with documented heritage by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) since 2004.\n\nAn extensive research was carried out by Gundohing Richard Francis Tunggolou entitled, \"The Origins and Meanings of the terms “Kadazan” and “Dusun\"\". The article explains in detail on the origins of the Kadazan term. \n\nIs it believed that there is evidence to suggest that the term has been used long before the 1950s. The Bobolians or the Bobohizans of Borneo were interviewed to seek better picture of the true meaning of the term 'Kadazan'. According to a Lotud Bobolian, Bobolian Odun Badin, the term 'Kadazan' means 'the people of the land'. A Bobohizan from Penampang, Gundohing Dousia Moujing, gave a similar meaning of Kadazan and reiterated that the term has always been used to describe the real people of the Land.\n\nOver a hundred years, the Kadazans were ruled by the Brunei Sultanate; the Kadazan or Kadayan (in Lotud, Kimaragang, Liwan etc.) were referred to officially by the Sultanate as the 'Orang Dusun' which literally means 'people of the orchard' in the Malays language. Administratively, the Kadazans were called 'Orang Dusun' by the Sultanate (or more specifically the tax-collector) but in reality the 'Orang Dusun' were Kadazans. An account of this fact was written by the first census made by the North Borneo Company in Sabah, 1881. Administratively, all Kadazans were categorized as Dusuns. Only through the establishment of the KCA (Kadazan Cultural Association) in 1960 was this terminology corrected and replaced by 'Kadazan'. When Sabah, Sarawak, Singapore and Malaya formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, administratively all Dusuns born since were referred to as Kadazans.\n\nInitially, there were no conflicts with regard to 'Kadazan' as the identity of the 'Orang Dusun' between 1963 and 1984. In 1985, through the KDCA (formally called KCA) the term Dusun was reintroduced after much pressure from various parties desiring a division between the Kadazan and the 'Orang Dusun' once again. This was largely successful and a precursor to the fall of the ruling political state party Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS). PBS, through the KCA, then coined the new term 'Kadazandusun' to represent both the 'Orang Dusun' and 'Kadazan'. Today, both Singapore and Malaysia acknowledge the ethnic group as Kadazandusun.\n\nThe Kadazandusun ethnic group belongs to the mongoloid human division, under the malayan-mongoloid racial segregation, with facial type fall mostly in the criterias of Group 1. The mongoloid human division refers to a group of human with physical traits as follows; dark hair colour, skin pigmentation colour type from yellow to brown, dark eyes colour with various brown tone from light to dark, and body height ranges from 150CM to 165CM. Malayan-mongoloids is a term use to refer the mongoloid human race that inhabits regions of Southeast Asia to East Asia. The classification of facial morphology is a guiding principle in the field of human sociology in the study of human facial structures classifications to determine specific facial features of each race for the purpose of humankind segregation by race.\n\nAccording to a Genome-wide SNP genotypic data studies by human genetics research team from University Malaysia Sabah (2018) , the Northern Borneon Dusun (Sonsogon, Rungus, Lingkabau and Murut) are closely related to Taiwan natives (Ami, Atayal) and non–Austro-Melanesian Filipinos (Visayan, Tagalog, Ilocano, Minanubu), rather than populations from other parts of Borneo Island.\n\nKadazan culture is heavily influenced by the farming of rice, culminating in various delicacies and alcoholic drinks prepared through differing home-brewed fermentation processes. \"To'omis\" and \"linutau\" are the main rice wine variants served and consumed in Kadazan populated areas, and are a staple of Kadazan social gatherings and ceremonies.\n\nThe most important festival of the Kadazans is the Kaamatan or harvest festival, where the spirit of the paddy is honoured after a year's harvest. This takes place in May, and the two last days of the month are public holidays throughout Sabah. During the celebration, the most celebrated event is the crowning of the Unduk Ngadau, the harvest festival beauty queen. Young women of Kadazan, Dusun, Murut or Rungus descent from certain districts compete for this title. The beauty pageant is held to commemorate the spirit of Huminodun, a mythological character of unparalleled beauty said to have given her life in exchange for a bountiful harvest for her community.\n\nIn marriages, dowries are paid to the bride's family and an elaborate negotiation is arranged between the groom and bride's families. As a traditional gesture of politeness and civility, the dowry is metaphorically laid out with match sticks on a flat surface, and representatives from each side push and pull the sticks across a boundary to denote the bargaining of the dowry. Dowries traditionally consisted of water buffaloes, pigs, sacks of rice and even urns of tapai. Modern dowry negotiations also include cash and land ownership deeds. The dowry includes the costs of the wedding with any additional costs above the price of the dowry to be paid for by the brides family. Kadazan women from the Penampang and Dusun women from the Keningau, Ranau and Tuaran districts are widely regarded to have the most expensive dowries.\n\nWhile it is traditionally customary for Kadazans to marry within a village or a neighbouring village, a downshift of xenophobia over the past few decades has eased the difficulty once associated with interracial marriage. Due to the overwhelming Christian influence and some marriages to Muslim spouses, resulting in a mandatory conversion to Islam, still induces outrage and rejection and is known to divide fiercely traditional Kadazans. Islam has lately been embraced by a growing minority as a means to political ends considering the fact that the local Malay minority has gained political ascendance in recent years. Ruling Malay political parties have also openly been giving political and economical privileges to Kadazans who agree to convert to Islam as well as to other non-Christian Kadazans. Conversion to Islam, in a Malaysian context, also results in an automatic conversion by law of ethnicity to Malay (source?) . The resultant demographic shift has in recent years further compounded the dwindling numbers of the Kadazan-Dusun community and consequently making it more challenging in its efforts to preserve the heritage.\n\nTraditional Kadazan cuisine involves mostly boiling or grilling which employs little use of oil, and with locally unique modifications and nuances as well as particular usage of locally available ingredients, particularly bamboo shoots, sago and fresh water fish. From simple appetizers of unripe mango dressed with soy sauce and chili flakes to a variety of pickled foods collectively known as \"noonsom\", tangy and pungent flavours from souring agents or fermentation techniques is a key characteristic of traditional Kadazan cooking. One of the most well known Kadazan dishes is \"hinava\", which is similar in concept to the South American ceviche.\n\nIt is a salad made with pieces of raw fish marinated in citrus juice, ginger, onion and other ingredients like bitter gourd and grated dried bambangan seed which is similar in texture to desiccated coconut strands. This dish is sometimes served in certain Sabahan restaurants which do not otherwise have a traditional Kadazan menu.\n\nAnother popular dish is \"pinasakan\", which consists of sea or freshwater fish (usually smaller species) cooked with \"bambangan\" (a variety of mango found in Borneo) or \"takob-akob\" (a very tart dried fruit). The \"bambangan\" fruit is also eaten with meals as an appetiser. It is often pickled as \"noonsom\" and garnished with grated bambangan seed. \"Tuhau\" is a fragrant local root that is often made into a salad or is preserved with vinegar as \"noonsom\".\n\nWild boar or \"bakas\", whether char grilled, stewed or even made into \"noonsom\" is very popular with the Kadazandusun community, often an essential item at weddings and major gatherings. Sweets include \"hinompuka\", a type of gooey rice cake steamed in banana leaves and flavoured with dark palm sugar. The Kadazan people are also renowned for \"lihing\", a sweet-tasting wine brewed from glutinous rice and natural yeast.\n\nContemporary Kadazan food is influenced by Chinese and Malay food as well as international trends, and often sees the use of traditional ingredients interpreted in new and novel ways. For example, \"bambangan\" is available as an ice cream flavour and chicken lihing soup or \"sup manuk nansak miampai lihing\" is popular with both Chinese and Kadazan communities alike. \"Lihing\" is also used in marinades, local variants of sambal relishes and even as a flavouring for stir-fried noodles.\n\nThe Kadazans have also developed their own unique dance and music. Sumazau is the name of the dance between a male and female, performed by couples as well as groups of couples, which is usually accompanied by a symphony of handcrafted bronze gongs that are individually called \"tagung\". The \"sompoton\" is another musical instrument. A ceremonial ring of cloth sash is worn by both male and female. The Sumazau and gong accompaniment is typically performed during joyous ceremonies and occasions, the most common of which being wedding feasts.\n\nThe Kadazan have a musical heritage consisting of various types of \"tagung\" ensembles - ensembles composed of large hanging, suspended or held, bossed/knobbed gongs which act as drone without any accompanying melodic instrument. They also use kulintangan ensembles - ensembles with an horizontal-type melodic instrument.\n\nThe late Chief Priestess Bobohizan Bianti Moujing from Kg. Kandazon and the High Priestess Bobohizan Binjulin Sigayun from Kg. Hungab were consulted during their heyday on the evolution of \"tagung\" or gongs and the beats rhythm. Recently, O.K.K. Datuk Jintol Mogunting, the former District Native Chief of Penampang, who was an authority on the traditional culture and customs was also consulted and he gave similar narration of the legend that has been used for centuries of generations.\n\nIt was said that after the resurrection of Huminodun, from the original Bambaazon, the lifestyle of the Nunuk Ragang community as they were then known, began to improve as there was an abundant supply of food. The legend goes on to narrate that the spirit of Huminodun founded the Bobohizans as they were taught the art of rites, ritual practices and ceremonies, taboos, traditional cultures including the art of gong beating and the Sumazau dance. During the civilization of Nunuk Ragang, the Bobohizans taught the people to fashion bamboos into various lengths, shapes and sizes and arranged them into an ensemble of seven musical instruments, the seventh item being the drum (\"gandang\"), which we know today as \"tongkungon\", \"tongunggu\" and \"tongunggak\". The Bobohizans then taught the people the beat rhythm of \"tagung\", known today as \"magagung\", \"botibas\" and \"dunsai\". Another musical instrument, the Kulintangan; akin to the xylophone, would be played as an accompaniment to the \"magagung\".\n\nIn the late 18th century, the Bruneian traders introduced brass gong canons and brasswares in North Borneo. The Kadazans were fascinated with these new brass items as they perceived the brasswares elegant and gong sound melodious. Then, they began to acquire collections of these brass times as family heirlooms and the gongs were arranged into the typical ensemble of seven instruments, to replace the bamboo gongs. Since then, the gong beats and rhythm were improved for a variety usage. The gong beats to accompany any ritual ceremonies are usually monotonous.\n\nAs for weddings, festive occasions and welcoming receptions for dignitaries, the rhythm of the gong beat is exhilarating, melodious, lively and smooth. Sometimes the \"botibas\" gong beat is performed as variation. During funerals, the \"dunsai\" gong beat is very solemn and fearsome as a symbol of respect for the dead. The single beat of a solitary gong at short intervals was used to be signal for emergencies such as house on fire and missing people who were lost in the jungle or drowning. However, there are only a few of Kadazan people that know the skills of beating the \"tagung\"s. It would require one long practice to gain experience.\n\nIt has been an issue that the present-day Kadazan youths are not inclined to gain skills in playing the traditional music instruments. Thus, \"magagung\" competitions and Sumazau competitions are organised at the village level not only to mark the Kaamatan celebrations but rather to preserve and promote the culture of Kadazan music and dance. Eventually, the competitions are held at district level where the Sumazau competitions were judged according to its choreography and the \"magagung\" according to the gong beats, rhythm and tempo.\n\nIn the early 1900s, these brass items were valuable items and became a symbol of family wealth. Once, they were highly in demand as dowries for marriage. Families that did not have them face difficulty meeting dowry requirement and would be compelled to search for these items elsewhere before the wedding. This custom still prevails in certain districts. Notably, many districts have most of the dowry converted into cash. As for the \"badil\" or canons, brassware and especially the gongs, they have become priceless and rare commodities. An ordinary set of gongs would cost about RM10,000 and the best set with high quality sound would cost around RM15,000. The original gongs, though popularly known as brass, are not entirely brass. They are actually made of composites of iron, brass and copper, to produce a smooth, reverberating and xylophonic tone. Gongs made entirely of brass are not popular because the sound produced has a flatsonic resonance.\n\nKulintangan or miniature gongs consist of nine ensemble and according to preference, it may be performed simultaneously with the gong to enhance the gong music. The latest type of gongs are made entirely of flat iron sheets, that were produced in Kudat. These are usually available at the weekend market or Tamu in Donggongon, Penampang in which each set would cost between RM700 to RM1,500. The sound quality of these gongs are more like cymbals clashing and shrills. People who are interested to know the best-quality melody gongs may drop by to any \"magagung\" and Sumazau competitions during Ka'amatan Harvest Festival from 30 to 31 May at Kadazan Dusun Cultural Association (KDCA) in Penampang.\n\nThe majority of the Kadazans are Christians, mainly Roman Catholics and some Protestants. Islam is also practised by a growing minority. Prior to the conversion to Christianity and Islam, the dominant religion was Momolianism, which some scholars equate to animism.\n\nAnimism was the predominant religion prior to the arrival of Roman Catholic missionaries during British North Borneo administration in 1880s. The Protestant influence is due to later British influence during the 20th century. There was no \"religion\" for ancient Kadazan-Dusuns and to them, it was just a sort of relationship between the seen and the unseen.\n\nThe Kadazan belief system centres around a single omnipotent deity called Kinorohingan. Rice cultivation is the center of Kadazan life and as such, various rites and festivals are celebrated and revolve around paddy cultivation. Kaamatan is the most recognizable festival attributed to the Kadazan-Dusun. This annual festival is essentially a thanks-giving ceremony and in the olden days also serve to appease the rice spirit, Bambaazon. Special rituals are performed before and after each harvest by a tribal priestess or a spirit medium known as a Bobohizan.\n\nAdditionally, the majority of the Kadazan-Dusun people believe that the spirits of their ancestors dwell on the top of Mount Kinabalu. The Bobohizan does a ritual every year to appease the guiding spirit of the mount. The purpose of conducting such rituals is to placate the spirit of Mount Kinabalu as well as the ancestral spirits. The religious ceremonies are understood to be a means of seeking the spirit’s sanction and soliciting\ntheir protection during a climb.\n\nThe Kadazan community as a ritual isolate is in constant interaction with the spirit world. This involves a number of sacrificial ceremonies to create a balanced ritual state between the Kadazans and the spirit world. The Kadazans believe in four principal spirits; the Almighty Creator (\"Minamangun\"), a living person's spirit (\"koduduvo\"), the ghostly spirit of the dead (\"tombivo\") and the evil spirit (\"ogon\").\n\nThe significance of Bobohizan\n\nWhen asking for help from a Bobohizan to cure someone's prolonged or severe illness, the priestess is usually called upon. The Bobohizan would be informed with the latest information that will give her a good background in locating to the cause of sickness.\n\nBobohizans can also do preliminary consultations with the \"susukuon\" or the good spirit consultants. Before the Bobohizan goes to the house of the sick person the next day, she firstly would have to consult her \"susukuon\" the night before as to find the best way possible, determining the right offerings she could approach in the healing ceremony. She will then know whether a chicken, a pig or even a buffalo would be needed as a sacrifice. At some time, it may only take a simple \"inait\" or prayer to heal the sick. There are a number of \"inait\" or prayers that a Bobohizan has to choose depending on the cause of the sickness. The basic is the \"popo'ontong\" or \"sumuku\" to get in touch with the good spirit consultants for further guidance.\n\nThe Bobohizan may proceed to any of the following or other form of prayers which are; searching for strayed spirit of the sick person and preparing for its homecoming, appeasing the evil spirits that cause the person's sickness with the offerings, reaching the stage of \"Rundukon\" or being in the trance of possible dialogue with the evil spirit in which the priestess becomes the oracle for communicating in attempt to know the evil spirit's intentions. It is the longest performance of the Bobohizan that could last for almost 24 hours.\n\nThey also can read the prayers to 'cleanse the debris' that has been induced into the person's body by evil spirit, cure a person from the effects of black magic and liberate a sick person from the grip or disturbance of the dead. After being treated by Bobohizan for a day, sometimes for three days, one is not allowed to go out from the house.\n\nThe honouring of Bambaazon\n\nIn preparation for the ceremony, the village priestess carefully select stalks of paddy and ties them together just before the harvesting period starts. These stalks are left in the field and not to be cut or tampered with until the harvesting is completed. The selected stalks of paddy symbolise the spirit of paddy, which is \"Bambaazon\". As soon as the harvest is over, these stalks are cut by the priestess and taken into the house of the owner of the field. The spirit would be in the house. \"Magavau\" will then take place when the padi is winnowed and stored away into the barns.\n\nThe ceremony of Magavau\n\nThe ceremony of Magavau begins just after sunset. The priestess and her attendants sit on the floor in the living room and start chanting ancient prayers (\"inaait\") to Bambaazon. This continues further into the night. Thereafter, the priestess and attendants stand up and circle slowly around the living room, while chanting. After a while, they start to sing songs of praise to Bambaazon. At this stage, the men join in the circle, singing together with the priestess and attendants. As they sing, they stamp their feet on the floor in rhythmic timing and at regular intervals uttering the awe-in-sparing \"pangkis\" which is the triumphant cry of the Kadazans. This ceremony will go on until the break of dawn when preparations are made to feed Bambaazon with the fermented rice (\"habot\"), with ingredients similar to tapai, prepared especially for the Bambaazon in the previous evening and \"tapai\". The ceremony ends with merry making as a mark of thanksgiving. Bambaazon stays in the house, guarding the paddy in the barn until the next planting season when another ceremony known as \"monogit\" is performed to take 'her' to the paddy field.\n\nHere is an instance of the prayers or incantations,\n\nThe ancestors of present-day Kadazans were among the people who have migrated from Taiwan. They can be referred to as Taiwanese aborigines (Formosan people). A research has stated, \"Over the next thousand years to 1500 BC, the Austronesians spread south through the Philippines to the Celebes, the Moluccas, northern Borneo and eastern Java. One branch went east from the Moluccan Island of Halmahera about 1600 BC to colonize eastern Melanesia (1200 BC) and Micronesia (500 BC). The migration had continued well into Polynesia by 0 AD and on to Hawaii and Easter Island by the year 500. The Austronesians finally reached the last uninhabited land on earth, New Zealand, sometime around 1300.\"\n\nPrehistoric Kadazan can be traced back to the time in which the Nunuk Ragang tree had existed. It is roughly located to-date at Tampias, where two rivers (Liwagu and Gelibang) meet to the east of Ranau and Tambunan. \"Nunuk\" is a Dusun word for banyan tree. \"Ragang\" as well comes from the Dusun word \"aragang\", which means \"red\". Nunuk looks like a giant mangrove tree with highly developed buttress stems with deep indentions that provide good natural shelters. The Nunuk Ragang or 'the red banyan tree' as told by the old folks, Widu Tambunan, measured of six out-stretched arms in circumference. The top of its canopy was estimated to be able to shelter under its seven joined Kadazan-Dusun huts, in which a hut measures 12 by 20 feet. Its numerous branches and giant thick foliage provided for ideal shelter and habitat of wild life, birds, insects and even spirits according to local beliefs. It was believed that the roots of the giant tree produced red latex that had a great medicinal value. In fact, the Nunuk's latex is still used to treat rashes and other minor skin diseases in modern days.\n\nEvacuation from the Nunuk Ragang area due to the Minorit Push of Nunuk Ragang, was decided through a meeting between the Bobohizans and the people. The leaders had made an agreement that the Tagahas (literally \"strong\") people were given a role to be the rear guard while others were immediately leaving Nunuk Ragang. River tributaries became their principal guidance to the direction of migrating. Each group's direction of migration is guided by the flow of Liwagu River. A Bobohizan said that, had the Kadazan-Dusuns not moved out of Nunuk Ragang, they would have not existed today.\n\nThe Kadazan and Rungus migrated out of Nunuk Ragang through Labuk River. The grouping of Kadazan and Rungus later arrived in Tempasuk, Kota Belud through the Marak-Parak valley. This is where they made the decision to split, in which one group would be heading to Matunggong, Kudat and the other would be heading to the West Coast, particularly Penampang and Papar. Initially, the Kadazans' settlement was an area with an abundant growth of mangroves (\"tangar-tangar\"), the area is believed to be present-day Beluran. Hence, they are referred to as Tangara or Tangaa. As for the Rungus, they had reached an area described to have the presence of white sand (\"pirungusan\"), which gives an explanation of how the Rungus obtained their demonym.\n\nThe Kadazan and Rungus share similarities in their languages, most probably because of the close relationship at Nunuk Ragang.As they settled the West Coast, the Kadazans met the Bruneians and other settlers. Barter trade occurred in which the Kadazans had their gongs, copper and silver wares, necklaces and bangles from the Bruneians.\n\nAccording to P.S. Shim's book \"Inland People of Sabah: Before, During and After Nunuk Ragang\" published in 2007, states that the ancestors of the Kadazandusuns came from Baram, Sarawak starting from the year 1200.\n\nP.S. Shim insisted that the Kadazan tribe settled the plains of Kimanis, Papar around 1220. Another group which identify themselves as the Tatana tribe settled in Bundu, Kuala Penyu. Subsequently, a great number of Kadazans migrated from Papar to Putatan-Penampang in the 1800s. Specifically, the first group was the Tangaa group. The second group was given the name 'Bangkaakon', which followed afterwards.\n\nThere was a war between the Tangaa and Bangkaakon which is believed to have occurred somewhere in Tombovo, Putatan. \nThe altercation was impactful enough that the Bangkaakon group had to move out and consequently made a settlement in an area known today as Minintod, Inanam.\n\nAccording to the legends that are told from generation to generation, the so-called Momogun Rungus was founded by a man who was persecuted by his brothers because he had various skills. He was good at making animal traps and making weapons which were capable of protecting his community then. It was because of his skills, he was persecuted. This caused him to be punished with his faithful wife and people by banishing them into the ocean.\n\nThe ships that they had boarded, were stranded on the island of Borneo, so they headed to Pampang Nabalu for religious purposes. He called himself an 'Usan-Usan', who had no family as he was being persecuted by his own siblings.\n\nWhile they were there, they were resurrected with religious spirits, following their worship of Lumaag Nabalu. Religious ceremonies continued to evolve as they were increasingly crowded. A religious figure proficient in law who inherited the customs of Usan-Usan was Aki Bobolizan Gomburon. As the crowd grew more, they felt that it was necessary for the laws of the society to be gazetted according to the rules of Usan-Usan.\n\nAki Bobolizan Gomburon enforced the most stringent Law of Gomburon that if someone committed adultery, they would be drowned into water by inserting them into a trap or 'diaper' alongside a large stone. The stone must be chosen by the offender. If anyone intentionally murdered (someone or something), then the person would be punished as well.\n\nThese rules continued until Aki Bobolizan Guraumanuk received a revelation from Lumaag Nabalu to abolish the Law of Gomburon. According to the revelation, any sin may be redeemed or paid with a slaughter which was referred to as \"mangaraha\" (pork slaughter).\nAll sins that could be redeemed with slaughter of lives, should be redeemed through the sacrifice of one's livestock. This task was done by a \"Bobolizan\", which roughly means \"payer of sin and middle person in begging for forgiveness to Kinoringan\". The meaning of \"Bobolizan\", derived from the Rungus word \"bwolzi\" which means \"to buy\". Pigs that were used to get a blessing or ask forgiveness from Kinoringan cannot be called \"vogok/wogok\" (\"a pig\") but it should be called \"bwolzi\". \"Bwolzi\" refers to the role of the animal in sacrifice as a redeemer so that the offender can get a new spirit after sin redemption.\n\nThen, the Momogun population grew more and more during the era of Aki Nunuk Ragang. Aki Nunuk Ragang was the most well-known Bobolizan in developing the teachings of Labus religion (animism). Before Aki Nunuk Ragang passed away, Aki Bobolizan Guraumanuk received a message from Lumaag Nabalu. This message was regarding a new rule in which the three sons of Aki Nunuk Ragang must migrate to anywhere else because Lumaag Nabalu told that all the rivers flowing from Mount Kinabalu to the sea, belonged to Momogun. Therefore, the Momogun grandchildren or descendants should choose a high place, a hill or the highest mountain in any area they would settle at. All the rivers that flowed to the sea from the highest hills were the places guarded by the spirit of Lumaag Nabalu by inviting it through a ceremony called \"Momurinaait\" (mentioning seven names of the main spirits that guarded the Momogun).\n\nBobolizan Guraumanuk's teachings were developed by Aki Nunuk Ragang. All of Aki Bobolizan Guraumanuk's will was proclaimed by Aki Nunuk Ragang. Three sons of Aki Nunuk Ragang were Aki Rungsud (ancestor of the Rungus), Aki Longuvai (ancestor of the Kadazan) and Aki Turumpok (ancestor of all Dusun tribes).\n\nAki Nunuk Ragang sent his sons Aki Rungsud (the eldest son) and Aki Longuvai (second son) to the coast by conquering Pompod Tana (Kudat, Kota Marudu and Pitas) so as not to be disturbed by Mizonvaig's invasions. According to the message they received through the \"Rundukon\" (approached by Lumaag that spoke in an incomprehensible language), told that the meeting area \"rahat kotonobwon\" (sea to the west) and \"rahat kosilzahon\" (sea to the east) began to be invaded by outsiders (pirates). Aki Nunuk Ragang decided to take control of the entire coastal area to keep the people safe. Therefore, the men responsible for the security of the coast were Aki Rungsud and Aki Longuvai.\n\nAki Turumpok as the youngest son was regarded as Tandon Tongkob (inheriting father's house) in which Aki Turumpok inherited his father's home. Tandon Tongkob still exists in the custom of the Rungus people today. \"Tandon tongkob\" means \"the content or occupant that remains in the room\". So, Aki Turumpok was the heir of Kg. Nunuk Ragang and became a leader there.\n\nSoon, Aki Nunuk Ragang died and was buried near a deep lake. The lake is located in the present place called Kampung Tampias in the area of Lubuk Sugut, Sandakan. According to legend, after 40 days Aki Nunuk Ragang was buried, on the day of the ceremony \"Mongupus\", there grew a fig tree at the middle of Aki Nunuk Ragang's grave. The fig tree was quite different because it was red and if the leaves were scratched, the tree would release human blood. Then, the people of Aki Nunuk Ragang worshipped the tree and named it \"Nunuk Ragang\" because they believed the tree was the incarnation of Aki Nunuk Ragang.\n\nAki Rungsud managed to conquer Pompod Tana and their descendants were referred to as Momogun Rungus. Meanwhile, Aki Longuvai was struggling. He was not willing to leave Nunuk Ragang for his wife was heavily pregnant and they would follow Aki Rungsud later. Aki Rungsud's journey would be marked with \"kukurungan\" (chicken cages) as indications. It was because every hilltop which would have been passed by Aki Rungsud, required a chicken to be sacrificed in order to call upon the guarding spirit of Borneo, Lumaag, and as the declaration of power over the territory they had passed through.\n\nWhen Aki Longuvai was tracking his brother's route, he had mistaken the direction. This was all due to one route, in which there were two pathways that were going towards opposite directions. \"Kukurungan\" marked by Aki Rungsud throughout the pathway of the journey unfortunately had been moved by a person with a bad intention, to the false position. As a result, Aki Longuvai was lost in the journey of tracking Aki Rungsud's path until they reached Pinampang or Penampang area (\"Pinampang\" most probably comes from the Kadazan/Rungus word \"pampang\" which means \"large rocks\"). They lacked the supply of food then they decided to make a hillyard there.\n\nAfter a long time, they did not come to Pompod Tana. Aki Rungsud eventually found out through Lumaag that Aki Longuvai was lost. Aki Rungsud instructed his men to find Aki Longuvai and luckily they found Aki Longuvai in Pinampang. The servants of Aki Rungsud invited Aki Longuvai to join a mission in Pompod Tana but Aki Longuvai declined the invitation. This was because Aki Longuvai was not willing to live in a war and to be in the state of emergency there. To fulfill their father's request, Aki Nunuk Ragang \"kodori\" (the late), Aki Longuvai promised to send his eldest son, Aki Bulun who was born after they came out of Nunuk Ragang. Aki Bulun, without anyone, came to Pompod Tana when he was 17 years old. Aki Bulun however was accompanied by seven extraordinary or highly immune dogs that were said able to beat a tiger.\n\nIn the session of dividing Pompod Tana into certain areas, Aki Bulun and Aki Rungsud made divisions of the area by marking the boundaries through a method that was by how far the sound of Aki Rungsud's gong could be heard. Thus, the attentive observers were camping at every hilltop in the Pompod Tana area at that time to hear the gong sounds. If the sound of the gong could not be heard anymore, then a spear would be pierced into the ground, called \"Binorudan\". \"Binorudan\" was a spear used by coastal warriors which was as large as a yacht paddle, moderate in size.\n\nToday, Aki Bulun's descendants are known as Rungus Gonsomon who once dominated the east coast of Kudat. If further detailed, the language of Rungus Gonsomon is almost the same as the Kadazan language. Due to the large number of dialects in Kadazan-Dusun ethnicity, it is believed that the original language used before the separation of Aki Rungsud and Aki Longuvai was Momogun Rungus. As the colonialists initially colonized the Penampang area, it had an early development with the establishment of shops for the colonial business's interests at that time. According to the ancestors, the people of Aki Longuvai who settled in the area of \"kedai-kedai\" or shops, were originally known as Kadazan people. In Rungus, \"kakadazan\" refers to \"shops\" or basically a town. When the Aki Rungsud people refer to the Aki Longuvai people, they would call them \"tulun antad sid kakadazan\" which means \"people from the shop areas or more advanced place.\"\n\nThe Nunuk Ragang area, after a while, became a place of chaos because Aki Turumpok abandoned the Labus religious laws (animism). Aki Turumpok was more likely to be in the competition of magical powers which resulted in the Nunuk Ragang area getting a \"kopizo\" (a bad sign). Whatever they do would result in contention and hostility to one another. This condition ended with the spreading of a disease because the \"mamasi\" ceremony was not performed.\n\nThe Kadazan dialect has adopted several loanwords, particularly from other northern Borneo indigenous languages and also Malay.\n\nThe use of the language has been declining due to the use of Malay by the Malaysian federal government and by the use of English by missionaries, which was done through the method of language shift enforced by the work of both the colonial and federal governments. The state of Sabah has introduced policies to prevent this decline, which is also happening to other native Sabahan languages. This included the policy of using Kadazan and other indigenous languages in public schools. Efforts have also been done to allow the language to become official in the state.\n\nIn an earlier 2005 Unesco’s report, the Kadazan-Dusun language was classified as an endangered language, spoken by a mere 300,000 people. The language has apparently joined the 7,000 other languages worldwide that face the threat of extinction. On the bright side, Datuk Philip Lasimbang, Chair of Board of Directors Kadazandusun Language Foundation (KLF) had stated that the Kadazandusun language will never go extinct because it has entered our education system, is formalised and has been institutionalised.\n\nThe similarities between the Kadazan and Dusun languages are sufficient for speakers of these two languages to understand each other easily. In a nutshell, the most salient distinction between these two languages are the differences in their phonemic charts.\n\nPresently, the Kadazans are associated together with another similar indigenous tribe, the Dusuns and various other indigenous peoples, under the blanket term Kadazan-Dusun. This is officially recognised as the result of political machinations, specifically a resolution of the supposedly non-political 5th KCA (Kadazan Cultural Association, which was then renamed to Kadazan-Dusun Cultural Association (KDCA)) Delegates Conference held between 4 and 5 November 1989. It was decided as the best alternative approach to resolve the \"Kadazan\" or \"Dusun\" identity crisis that had crippled and impeded the growth and development of the Kadazan-Dusun multi-ethnic community socio-culturally, economically and politically - ever since Kadazan versus Dusun sentiments were politicised in the early 1960s.\n\nKadazans and Dusuns share some similarity in language and culture albeit with differences in dialect. Many consider their traditional geographical influences as the major difference between the two ethnic groups. Kadazans are mainly inhabitants of the flat valley deltas, conducive to paddy field farming, while Dusuns are traditionally inhabitants of the hilly and mountainous regions common to the interior of Sabah.\n\nBeing indigenous to Sabah and a part of Malaysia, Kadazans are conferred the same political, educational and economic rights as the predominant Malay population of Malaysia. The term ascribed to this is Bumiputra (from Sanskrit \"Bhumiputra\"), a Malay word, which is translated to 'Sons of the Land'.\n\n"}

The name given by Bournon himself (in 1813) was endellione, since used in the form endellionite, after St Endellion, the locality in Cornwall where the mineral was first found.\n\nThe crystals are orthorhombic, and are generally tabular in habit owing to the predominance of the basal pinacoid; numerous smooth bright faces are often developed on the edges and corners of the crystals. They are usually twinned, the twin-plane being a face of the prism (m); the angle between the faces of this prism being nearly a right angle (86° 20′), the twinning gives rise to cruciform groups and when it is often repeated the group has the appearance of a cog-wheel, hence the name \"Rãdelerz\" (wheel-ore) of the Kapnik miners. The repeated twinning gives rise to twin-lamellae, which may be detected on the fractured surfaces, even of the massive material.\n\nIt is a mineral in medium temperature hydrothermal vein deposits. It commonly occurs with galena, tetrahedrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, stibnite, zinkenite, siderite, quartz, rhodochrosite, dolomite and barite.\n\nIt was first described for an occurrence in Wheal Boys in the parish of St Endellion in Cornwall, it was found associated with jamesonite, sphalerite and siderite. Later, still better crystals were found in another Cornish mine, namely, Herodsfoot mine near Liskeard, which was worked for argentiferous galena. Fine crystals of large size have been found with quartz and siderite in the mines at Neudorf in the Harz, and with sphalerite and tetrahedrite at Cavnic near Baia Mare in Romania. It has been reported from a large number of other localities.\n"}

After beginning his career in 1949, he subsequently won a Golden Globe Award for his performances in the films \"The Glory Brigade\" (1953) and \"The Kid from Left Field\" (1953). He went on to star in many films such as \"Underwater!\" (1955), \"Seven Cities of Gold\" (1955), \"The Revolt of Mamie Stover\" (1956), \"Love Me Tender\" (1956), \"A Summer Place\" (1959), \"Esther and the King\" (1960) and \"The 300 Spartans\" (1962).\nBorn and raised in San Francisco, California, Egan graduated from St. Ignatius College Preparatory. He won a public speaking competition in 1938 that helped fire his interest in performing. He was supported by his brother who was a priest.\n\nEgan was interested in drama and studied it while doing a BA at the University of San Francisco. He left in 1943 and served in the United States Army as a judo and knife fighting instructor during World War II. He served a year in the Philippines and was discharged with the rank of captain.\n\n\"The war had given me time to think,\" he later said, \"and to decide what I really wanted to do. I think I had always been an actor in my mind, but now I was going to be one in public, too. Right out in front of everybody.\"\n\nWhen Egan returned, he went back to school to earn a master's degree in theater history from Stanford University, with the help of the G.I. Bill. From there, he went on to teach public speaking at Northwestern University. While at Northwestern, he appeared in thirty campus stage productions and was eventually spotted by a Warner Bros talent scout, Solly Bioano, who encouraged him to try Hollywood.\n\nEgan had a series of unsuccessful screen tests. He eventually got a bit role in the 1949 Hollywood film \"The Story of Molly X\", at Universal. He had a small roles in \"The Good Humor Man\" (1950), at Columbia; \"The Damned Don't Cry\" (1950) (as Joan Crawford's husband) and \"Return of the Frontiersman\" (1950), at Warners; and \"The Killer That Stalked New York\" (1950), at Columbia.\n\nIn June 1950 Egan signed a contract with Universal. There he had supporting roles in \"Wyoming Mail\" (1950), \"Undercover Girl\" (1950), \"Kansas Raiders\" (1950), \"Up Front\" (1951); \"Highway 301\" (1950); \"Bright Victory\" (1951); and \"Up Front\" (1951). Egan later described these roles as saying things like \"Charlie, go outside! The horses are ready.\"\n\nHe had a role in \"Hollywood Story\" (1951), directed by William Castle, and the swashbuckler \"The Golden Horde\" (1951), where he was fourth billed.\n\nEgan was also in \"Flame of Araby\" (1951) and \"The Battle at Apache Pass\" (1952).\n\nEdward Small cast him in a support role in \"Cripple Creek\" (1952). Egan went to RKO for \"One Minute to Zero\" (1952) and MGM for \"The Devil Makes Three\" (1952), shot in Germany. He did \"Let George Do It\" on TV for \"Hollywood Opening Night\" (1952).\n\nEgan had support roles in RKO's \"Blackbeard the Pirate\" (1952) and \"Split Second\" (1953).\n\nEgan supported Victor Mature in \"The Glory Brigade\" (1953), a war movie at 20th Century Fox, then had a small part in \"The Kid from Left Field\" (1953). He did \"Malaya Incident\" and \"Double Bet\" for \"Ford Television Theatre\"(1953).\n\nEgan's career received a boost when a casting director, according to Egan, said \"Take off your shirt!\", and then cast him in a small role in \"Demetrius and the Gladiators\" (1954), as a gladiator who fights Victor Mature.\n\nThis led to Egan's first leading role, in Edward Small's \"Wicked Woman\" (1953). On TV he did \"Go Away a Winner\" for \"Schiltz Playhouse\" (1954), then had another lead in a low budget movie, \"Gog\" (1954), produced by Ivan Tors.\n\nSmall used him as a leading man again in \"Khyber Patrol\" (1954). He was used by RKO to costar with Jane Russell in \"Underwater!\" (1955), a notorious flop. However it led to Hedda Hopper declaring Egan to be one of the most promising actors of 1954.\n\nIn July 1954, Darryl F. Zanuck of Fox offered Egan a seven-year contract at two films a year.\n\nEgan was third billed in Fox's \"Untamed\" (1955), supporting Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward, taking a role that Victor Mature turned down. He was second billed in Fox's \"Violent Saturday\" (1955), directed by Richard Fleischer, starring Mature. The film was a success.\n\nFox announced him for \"Women in the Woods\" with Sheree North and Rita Moreno but it was not made.\n\nEgan was top billed in Fox's \"Seven Cities of Gold\" (1955), an adventure film. He had the star part in \"The View from Pompey's Head\" (1955), which was well received.\n\nHe starred in \"The Revolt of Mamie Stover\" (1956), opposite Jane Russell again (playing a part turned down by Marilyn Monroe).\n\nEgan went to RKO for a Western, \"Tension at Table Rock\" (1956). He followed this with another Western at Fox, \"Love Me Tender\" (1956), where Egan was top billed. It was a success at the box office. However this was attributed to the third-billed actor who played Egan's brother, Elvis Presley, whose first film it was. The success of the film saw Egan voted as the 13th biggest star in the US according to an exhibitor poll.\n\nEgan signed a contract with Universal where he made \"Slaughter on Tenth Avenue\" (1957), and \"Voice in the Mirror\" (1958).\n\nBack at Fox Egan supported Robert Mitchum and Robert Wagner in \"The Hunters\" (1958), and Don Murray in \"These Thousand Hills\" (1959).\n\nEgan had another hit with \"A Summer Place\" (1959) at Warner Bros. However, again, attention focused on younger cast members, Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue.\n\nIn 1960, Egan appeared with Jane Wyman and Hayley Mills in Disney's \"Pollyanna\". He co-starred with Joan Collins in Fox's \"Esther and the King\" (1960).\n\nEgan was Rod Serling's first choice to narrate \"The Twilight Zone\", because of his distinctive voice. However, contractual issues got in the way, and Serling narrated instead, rather than select any actor other than his first choice.\n\nEgan played the lead role of Leonidas I in Fox's \"The 300 Spartans\" (1962).\n\nEgan starred in the NBC western dramatic series, \"Empire\", which aired from September 25, 1962 to December 31, 1963. In the shortened second season, the program was renamed \"Redigo\" after Egan's character, ranch manager Jim Redigo.\n\nWhen the series ended Egan starred in a TV thriller \"Fanfare for a Death Scene\" (1964). He did \"Massacre at Fort Phil Kearney\" for \"Theatre of Stars\" (1966) and the TV movie \"Valley of Mystery\" (1967).\n\nIn 1966, when asked about his lack of film roles, he said, \"They want anti-heroes now, and it's just not for me. I'm just not right for that. It's much easier to be cynical than to make a positive statement, to set up a man only to knock him down, than to show convincingly a man who successfully sticks by his beliefs. We desperately need something to give strength and fortitude to the lost. I want to be a part of that. Part of the solution. And if I can't . . . well . . . I'm sure not interested in becoming part of the problem instead.\"\n\nEgan had the lead in some lowbudget films, \"Chubasco\" (1968) and \"The Destructors\" (1969) and a support part in \"The Big Cube\" (1969).\n\nEgan had the lead in \"Moonfire\" (1970) and co-starred with Barbara Stanwyck in \"The House That Would Not Die\".\n\nHe had the lead in the TV movie \"The Day of the Wolves\" (1971) and a support part in \"Left Hand of Gemini\" (1972) and \"Shootout in a One Dog Town\" (1974).\n\nEgan began guest starring on TV series like \"The Streets of San Francisco\", \"Matt Helm\", \"The Quest\", and \"Police Story\".\n\nHe had a lead in \"Throw Out the Anchor!\" (1974).\n\nIn 1974, he returned to the stage and for the next 8 years toured extensively in stage productions starting with \"No Hard Feelings\". (1974 until 1976). In 1976 he appeared in \"Time Out For Ginger\", 1976 to 1979 in \"Hanky Panky\", 1979 to 1981 in \"Broken Up\" and 1982 in \"I Ought To Be In Pictures\".\n\nEgan had the lead in a TV movie, \"Mission to Glory: A True Story\" (1977), and supported Robert Mitchum in \"The Amsterdam Kill\" (1977) and starred in the low budget Western \"The Sweet Creek County War\" (1979).\n\nEgan joined the political soap opera, \"Capitol,\" as a recurring character in 1982.\n\nEgan met his wife, Patricia Hardy, in 1956. The couple married in June 1958 and remained together for almost 30 years until his death. They had five children, including son Rich Egan, the founder of Vagrant Records, daughter Maureen Egan, a writer and director, as well as Patricia, Kathleen, and Colleen.\n\nEgan was respected within the acting community for having helped a number of young actors get their first break in the film industry. One of those young actors was Ryan O'Neal. He worked out at the same gym as Egan, who got him credited work in four episodes of \"Empire\".\n\nRichard Egan died in Santa Monica, California, on July 20, 1987, of prostate cancer. He is interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.\n\n"}

His father was a watchmaker there, and he himself was educated in his native city. He was a good artist and etcher, and also a pastor, so that by reason of his fine voice and love of music he was made (1768) precentor of the church of St Peter (the former cathedral) at Geneva.\n\nThis post enabled him to devote himself to the exploration of the Alps, for which he had conceived a great passion ever since an ascent (1761) of the Voirons, near Geneva. In 1775 he made the first ascent of the Buet (3096 m) by the now usual route from the Pierre à Bérard, on which the great flat rock known as the Table au Chantre still preserves his memory. In 1784–1785 he was the first traveller to attempt the ascent of Mont Blanc (not conquered till 1786), but neither then nor later (1788) did he succeed in reaching its summit. On the other hand, he reopened (1787) the route over the Col du Géant (3371 m), which had fallen into oblivion, and travelled also among the mountains of the Valais and the Bernese Oberland.\n\nHe received a pension from Louis XVI, and was named the \"historiographe des Alpes\" by Emperor Joseph II, who visited him at Geneva. His last visit to Chamonix was in 1812.\n\nBourrit's writings are composed in a naive, sentimental and rather pompous style, but breathe throughout a most passionate love for the Alps, as wonders of nature, and not as objects of scientific study. His chief works are the \"Description des glacières de Savoye\", 1773 (English translation, Norwich, 1775–1776), the \"Description des Alpes pennines et rhétiennes\" (2 vols., 1781), and the \"Descriptions des cols ou passages des Alpes\", (2 vols., 1803), while his \"Itinéraire de Genève, Lausanne et Chamouni\", first published in 1791, went through several editions in his lifetime.\n\n"}

{"id": "1799688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799688", "title": "Immunoprecipitation", "text": "Immunoprecipitation\n\nImmunoprecipitation (IP) is the technique of precipitating a protein antigen out of solution using an antibody that specifically binds to that particular protein. This process can be used to isolate and concentrate a particular protein from a sample containing many thousands of different proteins. Immunoprecipitation requires that the antibody be coupled to a solid substrate at some point in the procedure.\n\nInvolves using an antibody that is specific for a known protein to isolate that particular protein out of a solution containing many different proteins. These solutions will often be in the form of a crude lysate of a plant or animal tissue. Other sample types could be body fluids or other samples of biological origin.\n\nImmunoprecipitation of intact protein complexes (i.e. antigen along with any proteins or ligands that are bound to it) is known as co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). Co-IP works by selecting an antibody that targets a known protein that is believed to be a member of a larger complex of proteins. By targeting this \"known\" member with an antibody it may become possible to pull the entire protein complex out of solution and thereby identify \"unknown\" members of the complex.\n\nThis works when the proteins involved in the complex bind to each other tightly, making it possible to pull multiple members of the complex out of solution by latching onto one member with an antibody. This concept of pulling protein complexes out of solution is sometimes referred to as a \"pull-down\". Co-IP is a powerful technique that is used regularly by molecular biologists to analyze protein–protein interactions.\n\n\nChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a method used to determine the location of DNA binding sites on the genome for a particular protein of interest. This technique gives a picture of the protein–DNA interactions that occur inside the nucleus of living cells or tissues. The \"in vivo\" nature of this method is in contrast to other approaches traditionally employed to answer the same questions.\n\nThe principle underpinning this assay is that DNA-binding proteins (including transcription factors and histones) in living cells can be cross-linked to the DNA that they are binding. By using an antibody that is specific to a putative DNA binding protein, one can immunoprecipitate the protein–DNA complex out of cellular lysates. The crosslinking is often accomplished by applying formaldehyde to the cells (or tissue), although it is sometimes advantageous to use a more defined and consistent crosslinker such as DTBP. Following crosslinking, the cells are lysed and the DNA is broken into pieces 0.2–1.0 kb in length by sonication. At this point the immunoprecipitation is performed resulting in the purification of protein–DNA complexes. The purified protein–DNA complexes are then heated to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking of the protein and DNA complexes, allowing the DNA to be separated from the proteins. The identity and quantity of the DNA fragments isolated can then be determined by PCR. The limitation of performing PCR on the isolated fragments is that one must have an idea which genomic region is being targeted in order to generate the correct PCR primers. Sometimes this limitation circumvented simply by cloning the isolated genomic DNA into a plasmid vector and then using primers that are specific to the cloning region of that vector. Alternatively, when one wants to find where the protein binds on a genome-wide scale, ChIP-Sequencing is used and has recently emerged as a standard technology that can localize protein binding sites in a high-throughput, cost-effective fashion, allowing also for the characterization of the cistrome. Previously, DNA microarray was also used (ChIP-on-chip or ChIP-chip).\n\nSimilar to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) outlined above, but rather than targeting DNA binding proteins as in ChIP, an RNP immunoprecipitation targets ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Live cells are first lysed and then the target protein and associated RNA are immunoprecipitated using an antibody targeting the protein of interest. The purified RNA-protein complexes can be separated by performing an RNA extraction and the identity of the RNA can be determined by cDNA sequencing or RT-PCR. Some variants of RIP, such as PAR-CLIP include cross-linking steps, which then require less careful lysis conditions.\n\nOne of the major technical hurdles with immunoprecipitation is the great difficulty in generating an antibody that specifically targets a single known protein. To get around this obstacle, many groups will engineer tags onto either the C- or N- terminal end of the protein of interest. The advantage here is that the same tag can be used time and again on many different proteins and the researcher can use the same antibody each time. The advantages with using tagged proteins are so great that this technique has become commonplace for all types of immunoprecipitation including all of the types of IP detailed above. Examples of tags in use are the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) tag, Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) tag and the FLAG-tag tag. \nWhile the use of a tag to enable pull-downs is convenient, it raises some concerns regarding biological relevance because the tag itself may either obscure native interactions or introduce new and unnatural interactions.\n\nThe two general methods for immunoprecipitation are the direct capture method and the indirect capture method.\n\nAntibodies that are specific for a particular protein (or group of proteins) are immobilized on a solid-phase substrate such as superparamagnetic microbeads or on microscopic agarose (non-magnetic) beads. The beads with bound antibodies are then added to the protein mixture, and the proteins that are targeted by the antibodies are captured onto the beads via the antibodies; in other words, they become immunoprecipitated.\n\nAntibodies that are specific for a particular protein, or a group of proteins, are added directly to the mixture of protein. The antibodies have not been attached to a solid-phase support yet. The antibodies are free to float around the protein mixture and bind their targets. As time passes, the beads coated in protein A/G are added to the mixture of antibody and protein. At this point, the antibodies, which are now bound to their targets, will stick to the beads.\n\nFrom this point on, the direct and indirect protocols converge because the samples now have the same ingredients. Both methods gives the same end-result with the protein or protein complexes bound to the antibodies which themselves are immobilized onto the beads.\n\nAn indirect approach is sometimes preferred when the concentration of the protein target is low or when the specific affinity of the antibody for the protein is weak. The indirect method is also used when the binding kinetics of the antibody to the protein is slow for a variety of reasons. In most situations, the direct method is the default, and the preferred, choice.\n\nHistorically the solid-phase support for immunoprecipitation used by the majority of scientists has been highly-porous agarose beads (also known as agarose resins or slurries). The advantage of this technology is a very high potential binding capacity, as virtually the entire sponge-like structure of the agarose particle (50 to 150μm in size) is available for binding antibodies (which will in turn bind the target proteins) and the use of standard laboratory equipment for all aspects of the IP protocol without the need for any specialized equipment. The advantage of an extremely high binding capacity must be carefully balanced with the quantity of antibody that the researcher is prepared to use to coat the agarose beads. Because antibodies can be a cost-limiting factor, it is best to calculate backward from the amount of protein that needs to be captured (depending upon the analysis to be performed downstream), to the amount of antibody that is required to bind that quantity of protein (with a small excess added in order to account for inefficiencies of the system), and back still further to the quantity of agarose that is needed to bind that particular quantity of antibody. In cases where antibody saturation is not required, this technology is unmatched in its ability to capture extremely large quantities of captured target proteins. The caveat here is that the \"high capacity advantage\" can become a \"high capacity disadvantage\" that is manifested when the enormous binding capacity of the sepharose/agarose beads is not completely saturated with antibodies. It often happens that the amount of antibody available to the researcher for their immunoprecipitation experiment is less than sufficient to saturate the agarose beads to be used in the immunoprecipitation. In these cases the researcher can end up with agarose particles that are only partially coated with antibodies, and the portion of the binding capacity of the agarose beads that is not coated with antibody is then free to bind anything that will stick, resulting in an elevated background signal due to non-specific binding of lysate components to the beads, which can make data interpretation difficult. While some may argue that for these reasons it is prudent to match the quantity of agarose (in terms of binding capacity) to the quantity of antibody that one wishes to be bound for the immunoprecipitation, a simple way to reduce the issue of non-specific binding to agarose beads and increase specificity is to preclear the lysate, which for any immunoprecipitation is highly recommended.\n\nLysates are complex mixtures of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids, and one must assume that some amount of non-specific binding to the IP antibody, Protein A/G or the beaded support will occur and negatively affect the detection of the immunoprecipitated target(s). In most cases, preclearing the lysate at the start of each immunoprecipitation experiment (see step 2 in the \"protocol\" section below) is a way to remove potentially reactive components from the cell lysate prior to the immunoprecipitation to prevent the non-specific binding of these components to the IP beads or antibody. The basic preclearing procedure is described below, wherein the lysate is incubated with beads alone, which are then removed and discarded prior to the immunoprecipitation. This approach, though, does not account for non-specific binding to the IP antibody, which can be considerable. Therefore, an alternative method of preclearing is to incubate the protein mixture with exactly the same components that will be used in the immunoprecipitation, except that a non-target, irrelevant antibody of the same antibody subclass as the IP antibody is used instead of the IP antibody itself. This approach attempts to use as close to the exact IP conditions and components as the actual immunoprecipitation to remove any non-specific cell constituent without capturing the target protein (unless, of course, the target protein non-specifically binds to some other IP component, which should be properly controlled for by analyzing the discarded beads used to preclear the lysate). The target protein can then be immunoprecipitated with the reduced risk of non-specific binding interfering with data interpretation.\n\nWhile the vast majority of immunoprecipitations are performed with agarose beads, the use of superparamagnetic beads for immunoprecipitation is a much newer approach that is only recently gaining in popularity as an alternative to agarose beads for IP applications. Unlike agarose, magnetic beads are solid and can be spherical, depending on the type of bead, and antibody binding is limited to the surface of each bead. While these beads do not have the advantage of a porous center to increase the binding capacity, magnetic beads are significantly smaller than agarose beads (1 to 4μm), and the greater number of magnetic beads per volume than agarose beads collectively gives magnetic beads an effective surface area-to-volume ratio for optimum antibody binding.\n\nCommercially available magnetic beads can be separated based by size uniformity into monodisperse and polydisperse beads. Monodisperse beads, also called microbeads, exhibit exact uniformity, and therefore all beads exhibit identical physical characteristics, including the binding capacity and the level of attraction to magnets. Polydisperse beads, while similar in size to monodisperse beads, show a wide range in size variability (1 to 4μm) that can influence their binding capacity and magnetic capture. Although both types of beads are commercially available for immunoprecipitation applications, the higher quality monodisperse superparamagnetic beads are more ideal for automatic protocols because of their consistent size, shape and performance. Monodisperse and polydisperse superparamagnetic beads are offered by many companies, including Invitrogen, Thermo Scientific, and Millipore.\n\nProponents of magnetic beads claim that the beads exhibit a faster rate of protein binding over agarose beads for immunoprecipitation applications, although standard agarose bead-based immunoprecipitations have been performed in 1 hour. Claims have also been made that magnetic beads are better for immunoprecipitating extremely large protein complexes because of the complete lack of an upper size limit for such complexes, although there is no unbiased evidence stating this claim. The nature of magnetic bead technology does result in less sample handling due to the reduced physical stress on samples of magnetic separation versus repeated centrifugation when using agarose, which may contribute greatly to increasing the yield of labile (fragile) protein complexes. Additional factors, though, such as the binding capacity, cost of the reagent, the requirement of extra equipment and the capability to automate IP processes should be considered in the selection of an immunoprecipitation support.\n\nProponents of both agarose and magnetic beads can argue whether the vast difference in the binding capacities of the two beads favors one particular type of bead. In a bead-to-bead comparison, agarose beads have significantly greater surface area and therefore a greater binding capacity than magnetic beads due to the large bead size and sponge-like structure. But the variable pore size of the agarose causes a potential upper size limit that may affect the binding of extremely large proteins or protein complexes to internal binding sites, and therefore magnetic beads may be better suited for immunoprecipitating large proteins or protein complexes than agarose beads, although there is a lack of independent comparative evidence that proves either case.\n\nSome argue that the significantly greater binding capacity of agarose beads may be a disadvantage because of the larger capacity of non-specific binding. Others may argue for the use of magnetic beads because of the greater quantity of antibody required to saturate the total binding capacity of agarose beads, which would obviously be an economical disadvantage of using agarose. While these arguments are correct outside the context of their practical use, these lines of reasoning ignore two key aspects of the principle of immunoprecipitation that demonstrates that the decision to use agarose or magnetic beads is not simply determined by binding capacity.\n\nFirst, non-specific binding is not limited to the antibody-binding sites on the immobilized support; any surface of the antibody or component of the immunoprecipitation reaction can bind to nonspecific lysate constituents, and therefore nonspecific binding will still occur even when completely saturated beads are used. This is why it is important to preclear the sample before the immunoprecipitation is performed.\n\nSecond, the ability to capture the target protein is directly dependent upon the amount of immobilized antibody used, and therefore, in a side-by-side comparison of agarose and magnetic bead immunoprecipitation, the most protein that either support can capture is limited by the amount of antibody added. So the decision to saturate any type of support depends on the amount of protein required, as described above in the Agarose section of this page.\n\nThe price of using either type of support is a key determining factor in using agarose or magnetic beads for immunoprecipitation applications. A typical first-glance calculation on the cost of magnetic beads compared to sepharose beads may make the sepharose beads appear less expensive. But magnetic beads may be competitively priced compared to agarose for analytical-scale immunoprecipitations depending on the IP method used and the volume of beads required per IP reaction.\n\nUsing the traditional batch method of immunoprecipitation as listed below, where all components are added to a tube during the IP reaction, the physical handling characteristics of agarose beads necessitate a minimum quantity of beads for each IP experiment (typically in the range of 25 to 50μl beads per IP). This is because sepharose beads must be concentrated at the bottom of the tube by centrifugation and the supernatant removed after each incubation, wash, etc. This imposes absolute physical limitations on the process, as pellets of agarose beads less than 25 to 50μl are difficult if not impossible to visually identify at the bottom of the tube. With magnetic beads, there is no minimum quantity of beads required due to magnetic handling, and therefore, depending on the target antigen and IP antibody, it is possible to use considerably less magnetic beads.\n\nConversely, spin columns may be employed instead of normal microfuge tubes to significantly reduce the amount of agarose beads required per reaction. Spin columns contain a filter that allows all IP components except the beads to flow through using a brief centrifugation and therefore provide a method to use significantly less agarose beads with minimal loss.\n\nAs mentioned above, only standard laboratory equipment is required for the use of agarose beads in immunoprecipitation applications, while high-power magnets are required for magnetic bead-based IP reactions. While the magnetic capture equipment may be cost-prohibitive, the rapid completion of immunoprecipitations using magnetic beads may be a financially beneficial approach when grants are due, because a 30-minute protocol with magnetic beads compared to overnight incubation at 4 °C with agarose beads may result in more data generated in a shorter length of time.\n\nAn added benefit of using magnetic beads is that automated immunoprecipitation devices are becoming more readily available. These devices not only reduce the amount of work and time to perform an IP, but they can also be used for high-throughput applications.\n\nWhile clear benefits of using magnetic beads include the increased reaction speed, more gentle sample handling and the potential for automation, the choice of using agarose or magnetic beads based on the binding capacity of the support medium and the cost of the product may depend on the protein of interest and the IP method used. As with all assays, empirical testing is required to determine which method is optimal for a given application.\n\nOnce the solid substrate bead technology has been chosen, antibodies are coupled to the beads and the antibody-coated-beads can be added to the heterogeneous protein sample (e.g. homogenized tissue). At this point, antibodies that are immobilized to the beads will bind to the proteins that they specifically recognize. Once this has occurred the immunoprecipitation portion of the protocol is actually complete, as the specific proteins of interest are bound to the antibodies that are themselves immobilized to the beads. Separation of the immunocomplexes from the lysate is an extremely important series of steps, because the protein(s) must remain bound to each other (in the case of co-IP) and bound to the antibody during the wash steps to remove non-bound proteins and reduce background.\n\nWhen working with agarose beads, the beads must be pelleted out of the sample by briefly spinning in a centrifuge with forces between 600–3,000 x g (times the standard gravitational force). This step may be performed in a standard microcentrifuge tube, but for faster separation, greater consistency and higher recoveries, the process is often performed in small spin columns with a pore size that allows liquid, but not agarose beads, to pass through. After centrifugation, the agarose beads will form a very loose fluffy pellet at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant containing contaminants can be carefully removed so as not to disturb the beads. The wash buffer can then be added to the beads and after mixing, the beads are again separated by centrifugation.\n\nWith superparamagnetic beads, the sample is placed in a magnetic field so that the beads can collect on the side of the tube. This procedure is generally complete in approximately 30 seconds, and the remaining (unwanted) liquid is pipetted away. Washes are accomplished by resuspending the beads (off the magnet) with the washing solution and then concentrating the beads back on the tube wall (by placing the tube back on the magnet). The washing is generally repeated several times to ensure adequate removal of contaminants. If the superparamagnetic beads are homogeneous in size and the magnet has been designed properly, the beads will concentrate uniformly on the side of the tube and the washing solution can be easily and completely removed.\n\nAfter washing, the precipitated protein(s) are eluted and analyzed by gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, western blotting, or any number of other methods for identifying constituents in the complex. Protocol times for immunoprecipitation vary greatly due to a variety of factors, with protocol times increasing with the number of washes necessary or with the slower reaction kinetics of porous agarose beads.\n\n\n"}

He joined a travelling theatrical company, and made his first appearance on the stage at Gera as the messenger in Schiller's \"Braut von Messina\". By the interest of Count Brühl, he appeared at Rudolstadt as Franz Moor in Schiller's \"Die Räuber\", so successfully that he obtained a permanent engagement at the ducal theatre in Dessau, where he played until 1809. He then received a call to Breslau, where he remained for six years. Such was his success in the title-parts of several of Shakespeare's plays, that the leading actor August Wilhelm Iffland began to fear for his own reputation; yet that artist was generous enough to recommend the young actor as his only possible successor. On Iffland's death Devrient was summoned to Berlin, where he was for fifteen years the popular idol. He died there in December 1832.\n\nLudwig Devrient was equally adept in comedy and tragedy.

He was trained at the Theresiana Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt, from which he graduated seventh in his class. In 1822, he was assigned to the 27th infantry regiment of the Austrian Imperial Army. He was made a first lieutenant in 1833, and was assigned to the Quartermaster-General. In 1835, he was promoted to the rank of captain.\n\nIn 1840 Benedek was made a major and aide to the General Commander of Galicia. While still serving in Galicia he was again promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1843. For suppressing an uprising in the town of Gdow in 1846 he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Leopold as well as given the rank of colonel.\n\nIn August 1847, Benedek was entrusted with the command of the 33rd infantry regiment in Italy. On 5 April 1848 he took over the command of a newly formed brigade that consisted of two battalions. This brigade saw battle in the first Italian war of independence several times, notably at Curtatone in 1848. The following day, Benedek led his troops in the Battle of Goito.\n\nBenedek was afterwards awarded the Commanders' Cross of the Order of Leopold, and the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. This officially made Benedek a knight (hence Ludwig, Ritter von Benedek). On April 3, 1849, he became major general and was appointed to the staff of the Chief of Quartermaster-General with the 2nd Army in Italy.\n\nIn 1849, Benedek was sent to Hungary. Leading troops in the Battle of Győr, he was instrumental in striking down the rebellion. At another battle in Szőny he was seriously wounded. He was given the Military Merit Cross and made regimental colonel. Benedek was made chief of staff to Radetzky in Italy.\n\nHe was promoted to Feldmarschallleutnant in 1852 and, when Radetzky retired in 1857, Benedek became the commander of the II Army Corps.\n\nIn early 1859, Benedek was commander general of the VIIIth army corps in the Second Italian War of Independence. On 27 May 1859, he was promoted to the rank of Feldzeugmeister, second in command of the entire Austrian Army. On 24 June, under the command of the young Emperor Franz Joseph I, he fought in the Battle of Solferino against the French troops of the Emperor Napoleon III.\n\nBenedek was attacked on the right flank by the entire army of King Victor Emmanuel II of Piedmont-Sardinia, just a few kilometers north of Solferino in the Battle of San Martino. The Austrian units threw the Piedmontese back at first and were able to hold their ground. In the meantime Franz Joseph was defeated at Solferino and Benedek aided his retreat to San Martino. Benedek received the Commander's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa in 1859.\n\nAfter the Austrian defeat, Benedek was appointed Chief of the General Quartermaster Staff on January 31, 1860, and to the governorship of Hungary in April.\n\nOn October 20, 1860, Benedek assumed command of the Austrian forces in Lombardy-Venetia, Carinthia, Carniola, the Tyrol and the Adriatic Coastland and was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold with War Decoration on January 14, 1862.\n\nBenedek was a staunch believer in the concept that the army was the chief guardian of the Habsburg monarchy and needed to protect it from liberal and nationalist forces; loyalty to the dynasty and monarch were paramount and suspicion of the civilian professional and business classes followed. In a circular to his officers in March 1861 he warned against \"international revolutionaries, lawyers and doctors without practices, ambitious and money-hungry journalists, dissatisfied professors and schoolteachers\" as well as \"debt-ridden nobles and cowardly magnates\" who threatened the monarchy. A year later he further stated in Verona that the army's purpose was \"to serve, fight, and if necessary die with honor for the emperor and supreme warlord.\" Benedek believed in a traditional concept of war where valor and courage were of chief importance, where \"simple rules\" were superior to \"complicated calculations\". Following in this vein, he opposed the notion of a national, Prussian-style general staff of officers selected for their education and intellect.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, Benedek was made the commander in chief of the Northern Army. He had previously declined the appointment three times, claiming that he knew neither the terrain in the north nor the enemy. Delaying his departure from Verona for nearly two months, he arrived in Vienna only on May 12 and did not establish his headquarters at Olmütz (Olomouc) until May 26. Furthermore, his two chiefs of staff, von Krismanić and von Henikstein, encouraged his pessimism and reluctance to engage the enemy.\n\nWhile the Prussians advanced against and defeated Austria's German allies (Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, and Saxony), Benedek remained in a defensive posture. Urged by Emperor Franz Joseph's emissary, Lieutenant Colonel Friedrich Beck, to advance, Benedek and his staff replied the army was still not ready. Concerning himself with issues of military dress and ceremony and emphasizing the importance of close combat in the coming battles (despite the superiority of the Prussians' needle guns), Benedek only deployed his troops at the end of June. Marching in three columns, they took up defensive positions near the fortress of Josefstadt and the Saxon and Silesian mountain passes.\n\nWhen the Prussians crossed into Bohemia, Benedek failed to mass his forces against the separate enemy formations and suffered defeats across his front (except for a costly stand at Trautenau). Despite ordering a change of tactics and suddenly admitting the importance of artillery fire prior to the bayonet charge, morale among both the leadership and soldiers was shaken, and Benedek ordered his troops back to Olmütz. Stating that a \"catastrophe\" was at hand, he pleaded with the emperor to make peace with Prussia. When this was refused, he drew up his army in a defensive position against the Elbe between Sadowa and Königgrätz.\n\nWhen on July 3, 1866, the Prussians attacked, Benedek had a numerical advantage. Yet he expected to face only the Prussian First Army, and the arrival of the Prussian Second Army under Crown Prince Frederick William, attacking the Austrian flank at Chlum, disrupted the Austrian lines. Benedek ordered a retreat and crossed the river himself in the evening and informed the emperor that the catastrophe he had feared had indeed taken place. He offered to rally again at Olmütz but the retreat became a near rout. On July 10, Archduke Albrecht was appointed commander of all armies and established defenses around Vienna. However, the Prussians had achieved their objectives and were suffering a cholera outbreak while the Austrians were desperate for an end to the fight; an armistice was signed on July 21.\n\nThis placed Emperor Franz Joseph I in a difficult position. There was extensive demand for the blame for the defeat to be placed on Benedek. He resigned as commander-in-chief at Pressburg (Bratislava) on July 26, 1866. The highest military law senate imposed a court martial against him and was to investigate of the battle. This was stopped by the instruction of the emperor.\n\nBenedek was ordered never to speak about the circumstances of the defeat. When a scathing article in the \"Wiener Zeitung\" on December 8, 1866, blamed him alone for the catastrophe, he had no right to reply.\n\nThe former first soldier of the Empire lived for another fifteen years in quiet retirement at Graz, and died there on April 27, 1881.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1799719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799719", "title": "Lucius Licinius Crassus", "text": "Lucius Licinius Crassus\n\nLucius Licinius Crassus (140 BC – September 91 BC), sometimes referred to simply as Crassus Orator, was a Roman consul and statesman. He was considered the greatest orator of his day, most notably by his pupil Cicero. Crassus is also famous as one of the main characters in Cicero's work \"De Oratore\", a dramatic dialogue on the art of oratory set just before Crassus' death in 91 BC.\n\nLucius Licinius Crassus was born in 140 BC. It is not known exactly which Licinius Crassus his father was, as there are a number of similarly-named Licinii Crassi active in the mid-second century BC. However, prosopographical investigation by scholars has established that he must have been a grandson of Gaius Licinius Crassus, the consul of 168 who marched his army from Gallia Cisalpina to Macedonia against the will of the Senate. Lucius was, therefore, the child of one of this Gaius Crassus' sons.\n\nLucius was taught at a young age by the Roman historian and jurist Lucius Coelius Antipater. He also studied law under two eminent statesmen, both of whom were from branches of the \"Mucii Scaevolae\" \"gens\": Publius Mucius Scaevola (the father of Crassus' colleague as consul, Quintus Mucius Scaevola 'Pontifex'); and Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur. The latter was still alive in the year of Crassus' death (91 BC), and appears alongside Crassus as a character in Cicero's \"De Oratore\"; he was also the father of Crassus' wife, Mucia.\n\nWhen aged only 21, Crassus shot to fame in 119 BC for his prosecution of the proconsul Gaius Papirius Carbo, who committed suicide rather than face the inevitable guilty verdict. From this point on, Crassus was recognised as one of the foremost orators in Rome.\n\nHowever, Crassus came to regret this celebrated prosecution because it brought him many political enemies. One such enemy was Carbo's son, Gaius Papirius Carbo the Younger, who followed Crassus to his province in 94 BC with the aim of gathering evidence for a revenge prosecution. Crassus was remembered by later Romans for his wise response to the younger Carbo; instead of sending him away from his camp, Crassus in fact invited Carbo into his closest circle of advisors so that he might win over his former enemy.\n\nLittle else is known of Crassus' political activities in the 110s BC. He is known to have supported the efforts of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus to create a citizen colony at Narbo Martius in 117 BC. At the age of twenty-seven (i.e. 113 BC), Crassus defended his relative Licinia, one of the Vestal Virgins who had been scandalously accused of infidelity that year. Crassus was successful during Licinia's first prosecution in front of the \"pontifices\", and she was acquitted. However, she was prosecuted again by the special inquisitor Lucius Cassius Longinus Ravilla in early 113. This time, Crassus was not successful, and Licinia was consequently buried alive.\n\nCrassus served as Quaestor sometime around the year 109 BC. He was appointed to the province of Asia Minor. On his return journey, he studied rhetoric at Athens, but departed after a dispute with the locals. Having missed the ceremony of the Eleusinian Mysteries by only two days, Crassus requested that the Athenians repeat the affair so that he too might be initiated. When the Athenians refused, he angrily left the city. It seems Crassus related this anecdote to the young Cicero, who recorded it many years later in the \"De Oratore\".\n\nCrassus served as Tribune of the Plebs in 107 BC at the age of 33. His tribunate was as an example of a notably 'quiet' one: Cicero had not realised Crassus even served as tribune until he read about it by chance in a passage of Lucilius.\n\nCrassus probably served as Aedile in 100 BC. Alongside Scaevola Pontifex (his future colleague in the consulship), Crassus put on expensive games for the people, which were remembered decades afterwards for their extravagance.\n\nAs was common with many young politicians at the start of the \"cursus honorum\", Crassus had employed \"popularis\" overtones in his prosecution of Carbo. But over time, he became an increasingly staunch defender of conservative values.\n\nIn 106 BC, Crassus gave a famous speech in which he defended the \"Lex Servilia\". This law was proposed by the consul Quintus Servilius Caepio, and aimed to end the equestrian monopoly on juries. Since the legislative reforms of Gaius Gracchus, jurors for a number of important courts had been drawn only from the ranks of the \"equites\". Crassus and the other conservative senators (the \"optimates\") wanted mixed juries drawn from both senators and equestrians. He therefore attacked the equestrian courts in a famous speech, considered by Cicero (who also preserves the following quotation from the speech) to be Crassus' finest moment:\n\n\"Save us from wretchedness, save us from the fangs of men whose cruelty can only be satisfied by our blood; do not let us be slaves to others, unless to you alone, the whole People, to whom we may and should be servants.\"\n\nIn the translation by Rackham and Sutton, published in 1942:\n\n\"Deliver us out of our woes, deliver us out of the jaws of those whose ferocity cannot get its fill of our blood; suffer us not to be in bondage to any, save to yourselves as a nation, whose slaves we can and ought to be.\"\n\nCrassus' oratory won the day, and the \"Lex Servilia\" was successfully passed. It was, however, to prove short lived, as a few years later a law of Gaius Servilius Glaucia (passed either in 104 or 101 BC) restored the equestrian monopoly on the juries.\n\nRegardless of the long-term outcome of the \"Lex Servilia\", Crassus' speech was highly celebrated. It became a literal model of Roman eloquence, and was being studied in a textbook by the young Cicero a few years later. In the last year of his life, Crassus once again attacked the equestrian juries when he championed the legislation of Marcus Livius Drusus the Younger in 91 BC (see below).\n\nIt is worth noting that when Quintus Servilius Caepio, the proposer of the jury law in question, was prosecuted in 103 BC by the tribune Gaius Norbanus for his catastrophic loss at the Battle of Arausio, it was Crassus who attempted the defence. However, the people's hatred against Caepio was too strong; Crassus lost the case, and Caepio was exiled.\n\nWhen consul in 95 BC, Crassus also successfully defended this Caepio's son, Quintus Servilius Caepio the Younger, from an unspecified charge. However, Cicero notes that in this instance Crassus' defence of the younger Caepio was rather half-hearted: 'for its laudatory purpose, it was long enough; but as a whole oration it was very brief'.\n\nCrassus had probably served as praetor by 98 BC. He was elected consul for 95 BC alongside his long-term ally Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex. It was during this consulship that Crassus defended the younger Caepio from an unspecified charge (see above).\n\nThe most notable act of Crassus and Scaevola's consulship was the \"Lex Licinia Mucia\". This was an infamous law that targeted any foreigners who were illegally masquerading as Roman citizens. The law created an investigatory court (\"quaestio\") tasked with forcing such individuals to revert to their former citizenships.\n\nIt was very unpopular, particularly among the non-Roman Italian allies. In fact, it was so controversial that later Roman commentators sometimes saw it as a main cause of the Social War (91–88 BC) that began several years later.\n\nCrassus was granted Cisalpine Gaul as his proconsular province for 94 BC. Despite defeating a number of Gallic raiders, he failed to gain a triumph due to the veto of his consular colleague, Scaevola Pontifex.\n\nCicero later judged that Crassus had been in the wrong, remarking that 'Crassus almost ransacked the Alps with a probe, in order to find any pretext for a triumph in an area where there were no enemies'. But even if Crassus was acting unscrupulously, Scaevola's veto is still remarkable. Theodor Mommsen, for instance, could find no precedent for it whatsoever. The veto is particularly inexplicable given the former friendship between the two men: they had, after all, shared office at every stage of the \"cursus honorum\", as Cicero points out, and there had been no signs of hostility during their consulship.\n\nIt was likely in 94 BC that Crassus won the so-called \"\"Causa Curiana\"\" – an infamous inheritance dispute between Manius Curius and the family of one Marcus Coponius. Crassus represented Curius in the case, while Scaevola Pontifex represented the Coponii family. Cicero refers to the dispute many times during his works.\n\nCoponius had left an as-yet-unborn son as his chief heir, with Curius as the substitute heir until the son came of age. However, Coponius soon died and no son was born. The Coponii therefore claimed that the prerequisite conditions (i.e., the birth of a son) had never been fulfilled, meaning that the will should be rendered invalid. However Crassus successfully convinced the Centumviral Court that Curius \"was\" the rightful heir, thereby securing Marcus Coponius' considerable inheritance for Curius alone. Cicero considered Crassus' defence the perfect example of how to win a case through terminological niceties.\n\nIn 92 BC Crassus was elected censor with Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. The two colleagues were well remembered by ancient sources for their petty disputes—for example, in exchanging insults over one another's luxurious mansions. Eventually, these public quarrels forced them to abdicate the position early, amid much scandal and controversy.\n\nCrassus and Ahenobarbus did manage to agree on passing a famous edict, preserved for us in a later work by Suetonius, that banned the so-called 'schools of Latin rhetoric'. Instead of the usual Greek, these schools taught their students rhetoric in Latin. It seems this was considered immoral and un-Roman - Cicero called them 'schools of impudence' - and this might explain why Crassus and Ahenobarbus believed the edict necessary. However, some modern scholars have sought political reasons for the act as well.\n\nCrassus died suddenly in September 91 BC, but was politically active until the final days of his life. Alongside the \"princeps senatus\" Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, Crassus was the main conservative champion of the radical tribune Marcus Livius Drusus, whose legislative package of reforms was planned as a means of reconciling the interests of the Senate, the equestrians, and the urban poor.\n\nIn particular, Crassus gave a memorable speech on the 13 September 91 BC defending Livius Drusus from the attacks of the consul Lucius Marcius Philippus. In the words of Cicero, 'this was literally Crassus' \"swan song\" ... for he fell sick and died a week later'.\n\nCrassus' unexpected death robbed Drusus of one of his most influential supporters, and Philippus soon succeeded in his attempts to have all of Drusus' legislation abrogated on religious technicalities. Drusus was eventually assassinated by an unknown hand, an event commonly viewed by ancient sources as precipitating the outbreak of the Social War (91–88 BC).\n\nCicero praises Crassus' oratorical skill at many points in his surviving texts. For example, in Cicero's history of oratory (a work known as the \"Brutus\" after its dedicatee Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger), Crassus is portrayed as the greatest Roman orator to have yet lived. Indeed, Cicero believes that the only two orators to come close to Crassus' skill were Crassus' contemporary Marcus Antonius Orator (grandfather of the famous Mark Antony) and Cicero himself. Cicero weighs up the relative skills of Antonius and Crassus with the following words:\n\nFor my part, though I assign to Antonius all the virtues that have pointed out above, I still hold that nothing could have been more perfect than Crassus. He possessed great dignity, and combined with dignity a pleasantry and wit, not smart nor vulgar, but suited to the orator; his Latinity was careful and well chosen, but without affected preciseness; in presentation and argument his lucidity was admirable; in handling questions, whether of the civil law or of natural equity and justice, he was fertile in argument and fertile in analogies ... No one could surpass the resourcefulness of Crassus.\n\nCicero's admiration for Crassus and Antonius is also evident in the \"De Oratore\", his treatise on the art of oratory. In this, they appear as the two central characters of the dialogue, debating the attributes of the ideal orator in the presence of a number of younger aspiring orators, including Gaius Aurelius Cotta, Publius Sulpicius Rufus, and Gaius Julius Caesar Strabo.\n\nAs well as the skills praised above, Crassus was said to have extensive knowledge of the Roman legal system. Cicero calls Crassus the 'ablest jurist in the ranks of orators', capable even of besting his (and Cicero's) former mentor, the great jurist Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur. Cicero also notes with admiration the intense preparation Crassus undertook before every case; this was all the more necessary because Roman orators very rarely came into court with more than a few written notes with them.\n\nIn terms of Crassus' oratorical style, he apparently kept the ideal line between extremes; neither too active nor too still, neither too impassioned nor too calm, witty and yet always dignified:\n\nNo violent movements of the body, no sudden variation of voice, no walking up and down, no frequent stamping of the foot; his language vehement, sometimes angry and filled with righteous indignation; much wit but always dignified, and, what is most difficult, he was at once ornate and brief.\n\nCicero also notes that Crassus liked to break up his sentences into many short, sharp clauses, the effect being to create a simple style of speaking ('a natural complexion, free of make up').\n\nIt is also noted by Cicero in \"De Oratore\" that Licinius Crassus was a friend of the philosopher Marcus Vigellius.\n\nLicinius Crassus was married to a daughter of the Consul Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur (not to be confused with Crassus' consular colleague, Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex) and his wife Laelia, who was a daughter of Gaius Laelius Sapiens. Crassus and his wife had three surviving children:\n\n\nCrassus' third daughter, Licinia (Tertia), married Gaius Marius the Younger, son of the famous general and statesman Gaius Marius. The marriage may have taken place around 95 BC, though the date is pure supposition by scholars, based on the known political alliance between the two fathers, the fact that men could not marry before they turned 14, but that leading families tended to marry early to cement alliances.\n\nNothing is known of this Licinia after Marius the Younger's death in 82 BC. However, many years later in the time of Julius Caesar's dictatorship, a certain Amatius appeared in Rome claiming to be their son. Cicero seems to have accepted the possibility that he might indeed be a Marius, but he refused nonetheless to help the man out publicly. This Amatius was murdered on the orders of Mark Antony after Caesar's assassination.\n\nCrassus was somewhat infamous in later generations for his luxurious lifestyle. In particular, he was notably the first Roman to use columns made of imported marble, in this case from Mt. Hymettus in Greece. His contemporaries also mocked him for this luxury. A Marcus Brutus dubbed him the 'Palatine Venus' for the apparent effeminacy of the columns, and a serious dispute broke out between Crassus and his colleague as censor, Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, over the marble.\n\nCrassus also had a beloved pet eel, much to the bemusement of later Roman commentators. When Crassus held a funeral for the pet, the same Domitius Ahenobarbus snidely commented on the affair. Crassus retorted: \"did you not bury three wives and not shed a tear?\"\n\n"}

He sat in the House of Commons between 1614 and 1622 when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Cranfield.\n\nHe was the second son of Thomas Cranfield, a mercer at London, and his wife Martha Randill, the daughter and heiress of Vincent Randill of Sutton-at-Hone, Kent. He was apprenticed to Richard Sheppard, a mercer in London and went into partnership with him in around 1599. He was introduced to King James I and VI of England and Scotland by Lord Northampton, and entered the Royal service in 1605.\n\nIn 1613, he was knighted and was appointed Surveyor-General of Customs. \nHe was elected Member of Parliament for Hythe in 1614. In 1616 he became one of the Masters of Requests, briefly in 1618 Keeper of the Great Wardrobe and in 1619 Master of the Court of Wards and Liveries and Chief Commissioner of the Navy. He was elected MP for Arundel in 1621. Cranfield was responsible for many economies in the public service, and his business acumen was very useful to the King. \nHe took part in the attack on Lord St Alban in 1621, and although, contrary to general expectation, he did not succeed him as Lord Chancellor, he was created Baron Cranfield, of Cranfield in the County of Bedford, in July of that year. \nIn 1621 also he became Lord High Treasurer and in September 1622 was created Earl of Middlesex.\n\nCranfield lost his positions and influence shortly afterwards because he opposed the projected war with Spain, and had incurred the hostility of the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Buckingham. Impeached by the House of Commons for corruption, he was found guilty by the House of Lords in May 1624 and was sentenced to lose all his offices, to pay a heavy fine and to be imprisoned during the King's pleasure. However, he was released from prison in a few days, was pardoned in the following year, and was restored to his seat in the House of Lords in 1640. Middlesex died on 6 August 1645.\n\nCranfield's homes included Chelsea House, which he bought in 1619 and improved employing the services of Inigo Jones and Nicholas Stone, and Copthall in Essex. Furnishings were supplied by the upholsters Oliver Browne and John Baker who also supplied the royal court and wardrobe. These included a suite of furnishings for Anne Brett's \"lying-in\" at Chelsea in 1621 with a cradle with a canopy of crimson damask for James Cranfield in 1621. Furniture from Copthall was taken to Knole in 1701.\n\nCranfield married Richard Sheppard's daughter Elizabeth in 1599. His second wife was Anne Brett (died 1670), a cousin of Buckingham's mother, whom he married somewhat reluctantly in 1621 in order to ensure Buckingham's support.\n\nHe left with other issue a son, James Cranfield, 2nd Earl of Middlesex (1621–1651), who succeeded him as 2nd Earl and was a partisan of the parliamentary party during the English Civil War. The 2nd Earl was succeeded by his brother, Lionel, who died without issue in October 1674, thereafter the Earldom of Middlesex and Barony of Cranfield became extinct.\n\nThe 1st Earl's youngest surviving daughter, Frances, married Lord Buckhurst, later 5th Earl of Dorset, and their eldest son, Charles, by then Lord Buckhurst, was created Earl of Middlesex in 1675. Two years later he succeeded as 6th Earl of Dorset, and this Earldom of Middlesex was held by the Earls and then Dukes of Dorset until 1843, when it became extinct.\n\nChildren by his first wife Elizabeth Sheppard (d. 1617):\n\nChildren by his second wife, Anne Brett (d. 1670):\n"}

Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in Austria. Registered partnerships were introduced in 2010, giving same-sex couples some of the rights of marriage. Stepchild adoption was legalised in 2013, while full joint adoption was legalised by the Constitutional Court of Austria in January 2015. On 5 December 2017, the Austrian Constitutional Court decided to legalise same-sex marriage, and the ruling went into effect on 1 January 2019.\n\nThe country, while influenced by Roman Catholicism, has slowly become more liberal with laws and social opinions concerning sexual orientation and gender identity. In June 2019, Minister of Education, Science and Research Iris Eliisa Rauskala became the first government minister to come out as lesbian.\n\nSame-sex sexual acts have been legal since 1971. In 2002, the age of consent was equalized by a court decision from 18 to 14 years of age.\n\nFollowing the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights in \"Karner v. Austria\" in 2003, cohabitating same-sex couples were given the same rights as cohabitating opposite-sex couples.\n\nFirst planned in 2007, registered partnerships have been legal in Austria since 1 January 2010.\n\nBefore the Constitutional Court decided to legalize same-sex marriage, the Austrian Government had not legalised same-sex marriage due to opposition by the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP). The Greens had however introduced a bill in Parliament, and in 2015 a citizens' initiative \"Ehe Gleich!\" was set up to petition the Parliament to consider the legalisation of same-sex marriage. They also filed a lawsuit challenging the current law, however, it was dismissed by a lower court. A second lawsuit was heard on 21 March 2016 in Linz. On 15 April 2016, a court dismissed the case as well.\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the Constitutional Court struck down the ban on same-sex marriage as unconstitutional. The ruling would take effect on 1 January 2019, though the plaintiffs in the court case were allowed to marry prior to that date. In January 2018, the new ÖVP-Chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said on national television that his new Government will respect the ruling by the Constitutional Court and that same-sex marriage would become legal in Austria on 1 January 2019.\n\nOn 19 February 2013, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in \"X and Others v. Austria\" that a partner in a same-sex union has the right to adopt his or her partner's biological child. On 4 July 2013, the Austrian Parliament passed a government bill that allows stepchild adoption by same-sex couples. The law entered into force on 1 August 2013.\n\nIn January 2015, the Constitutional Court found the existing laws on adoption to be unconstitutional and ordered the laws to be changed by 31 December 2015 to allow joint adoption by same-sex couples. On 30 October 2015, the Justice Minister announced that the ban would no longer be enforced starting on 1 January 2016, thus allowing the Court's decision to automatically cancel the joint adoption ban.\n\nAdditionally, lesbian couples can get access to artificial insemination and IVF treatments.\n\nIn October 2018, in a case concerning adoption issues following the end of a relationship, the Austrian Constitutional Court ruled that same-sex couples must be treated the same way as opposite-sex couples. It decided that the non-biological mother should be fully recognized as a parent, through way of an adoption, and enjoy the same rights, treatment and obligations as a heterosexual father would, even if the couple has separated. The children's best interest must be taken and guaranteed in every adoption process, the court ruled.\n\nThe \"Equal Treatment Act\" () has included anti-discrimination protections on the basis of sexual orientation since 2004, to follow the implementation of EU legislation prohibiting discrimination on that ground. Gender identity and intersex status are not explicitly included, but are perceived as being covered under \"gender\". In January 2017, Lower Austria became the last Austrian state (\"Bundesland\") to update its anti-discrimination laws to cover sexual orientation in the provision of goods and services. Every other state had already established anti-discrimination laws covering sexual orientation.\n\nThe 1993 \"Security Police Act\" () requires the police to refrain from any actions that could create the impression of bias or that could be perceived as discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. In addition, the city of Bludenz adopted a symbolic non-discrimination declaration which includes sexual orientation in 1998. Although the Federal Constitution protects all citizens equally and prohibits discrimination, sexual orientation is not explicitly included.\n\nIn 2015, the Austrian Parliament approved amendments to the Criminal Code, making it an aggravating sentence to commit a crime on account of the victim's sexual orientation and banning hate speech on the basis of sexual orientation. The changes went into effect on 1 January 2016.\n\nTransgender people in Austria are allowed to change their legal gender and name so that they match their gender identity. They are not obliged to undergo sex reassignment surgery beforehand.\n\nOn 14 March 2018, the Constitutional Court preliminarily ruled that intersex people, who are biologically neither male nor female, can choose to have their entry in the birth registry left blank or changed to \"inter\", \"other\" or \"X\". In May 2019, as a result of the ruling, Austrian intersex activist Alex Jürgen was issued documents featuring a third gender option. The Court also ruled that intersex medical interventions are not constitutional and should be avoided as much as possible. It ruled that such medical interventions could only be justified in exceptional cases, such as in life-threatening cases. The final judgment was published on 29 June 2018, and entered into force immediately.\n\nAustria permits LGBT people to serve openly in the Austrian Armed Forces.\n\nAs of 2014, Austria allowed transgender people to serve openly in its military forces. The policy of inclusion was reportedly still in effect in 2017.\n\nIn June and July 2018, LGBT association HOSI Salzburg criticised the ultra-conservative Christian association \"Teen STAR\" for claiming that \"Homosexuality is considered an identity problem and 'aberration'\". The group offered minors conversion therapy classes by teaching them that sexual orientation was \"changeable\" through a combination of therapy, self-help groups and pastoral care, as reported by the \"Salzburger Nachrichten\" newspaper. Member of the National Council Mario Lindner (SPÖ) made a parliamentary request to former Minister of Education Heinz Faßmann on the allegations; another parliamentary question was launched by Member of the National Council Ewa Dziedzic (Greens). In October 2018, the Education Directorate Salzburg banned TeenSTAR workshops until the result of the review. Although the Ministry of Education announced a ban on the association, and a decree by Christmas 2018, as of February 2019, no decree had been published, and TeenSTAR continued to work in schools. In April, the association was finally banned.\n\nIn December 2018, a resolution calling for a ban on conversion therapy on minors was submitted to Parliament by SPÖ equal treatment spokesman Mario Lindner. A vote was initially prevented and delayed by the ruling ÖVP and FPÖ coalition. However, on 13 June 2019, in a preliminary vote, the National Council approved the resolution. The Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ), NEOS – The New Austria and Liberal Forum (NEOS) JETZT – Pilz List (JETZT), the two independent members and the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) all voted for the resolution; with the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) opposing. On 2 July 2019, the National Council approved the resolution in a final vote. In this vote, the FPÖ also agreed, on the grounds that children and adolescents should always be given priority protection. The resolution calls on the Government of Austria to \"immediately submit to the Federal Council a government bill banning the use of conversion and reparative therapies on minors\" by setting a deadline before summer.\n\nIn 1995, the International Human Rights Tribunal instigated the political discussion about the discrimination and persecution of LGBT persons in Austria. The first major parliamentary debates on that issue took place thereafter, initiated by the Liberal Forum (LIF) which was campaigning strongly against discrimination of homosexuals, which at that time existed through section 209 of the Austrian Penal Code, and for complete equality of treatment also including marriage and adoption. Section 209 set a higher age of consent for gay men, at 18 (instead of 14 for heterosexuals and lesbians). The Social Democrats (SPÖ) and the Green Party at that time showed support for the issue of equal treatment of same-sex couples.\n\nAfter the LIF did not pass the four percent electoral threshold in the 1999 elections, the Social Democrats and the Green Party started to embrace this issue more. The SPÖ on its biannual Federal Party Convention made a decision on the issue of equal treatment of same-sex couples. They proposed a model of registered partnership (\"Eingetragene Partnerschaft\") including stepchild adoption. The Austrian Green Party proposed the civil pact (\"Zivilpakt\") as a somewhat similar model to that of the Social Democrats in 2004.\n\nHowever, progress was visible to a limited extent. Since 1998, Austria has recognized the right not to testify against their partner if the partner is of the same sex, as amended in the Criminal Code. In June 2002, the Constitutional Court rescinded section 209 of the Criminal Code, which led to the introduction of section 207b as a substitute by the coalition of the conservative ÖVP and the right-wing FPÖ. Section 207b lowered the age of consent for all regardless of sexual orientation to 14 with a close in age exemption of 3 years. It also prohibits corrupting a minor under 16 to have sexual relations. Following the 2003 decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of \"Karner v Austria\", cohabiting same-sex partners are entitled to the same rights as unmarried cohabiting opposite-sex partners. In 2005, the Green Party campaigned heavily for registered partnerships during the Vienna election campaign in 2005. On 26 July 2006, the first legal same-sex marriage was conducted, when Angelika Frasl, a transsexual woman with two children, was permitted by the Constitutional Court to change her legal gender to female while remaining married to her wife.\n\nKarin Gastinger, the then Minister of Justice and a former member of the centre-right Alliance for the Future of Austria, had fought for gay and lesbian couples to get rights to partners' estates and medical care in December 2005. However, her case was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nIt was not thought likely that the coalition of Conservatives and Social Democrats formed in 2007 would result in major steps towards more equality quickly. Although the then Minister of Justice, Maria Berger, a Social Democrat, intended to improve the situation, she herself expected huge opposition by the conservative coalition partner ÖVP, most likely because her situation was similar to that of her predecessor Gastinger.\n\nFurthermore, Maria Fekter, former chairperson of the parliamentary committee for the judiciary, and former Minister of the Interior, repeatedly announced her opposition to registered same-sex partnerships and that conservative values would prevail. Though, despite such opposition, partnerships were approved in December 2009.\n\nOther, more conservative, political parties include the Austrian People's Party and the Freedom Party tend to oppose LGBT rights.\n\nOpenly LGBT politicians in Austria include Ulrike Lunacek, former Greens leader and the Vice-President of the European Parliament. Lunacek was elected to the National Council in 1999, remaining a member until 2009. In 2009, she became the first openly lesbian MEP. She retired from politics in 2017. In 2017, Mario Lindner (SPÖ) became the first openly gay politician to be elected to the National Council. Gerlad Grosz, member of the National Council between 2008 and 2013 and the party leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria between 2013 and 2015, came out as gay in 2013 just before his retirement from politics in 2015. Member of the Federal Council Ewa Dziedzic (Greens) and member of the Gemeinderat and Landtag of Vienna Faika El-Nagashi (Greens) are both lesbians. In April 2019, Georg Djundja (SPÖ) was elected as the first openly gay mayor in Austria, of the city of Oberndorf bei Salzburg.\n\nIn June 2019, Minister of Education, Science and Research Iris Eliisa Rauskala came out as lesbian and announced that she is married to a woman, becoming the first openly LGBT minister in the Government of Austria.\n\nSince the 2019 National Election seven politicians in the National Council are openly gay. With four politicians (Ewa Dziedzic, Faika El-Nagashi, David Stögmüller and Meri Disoski) the Green party has the highest number of LGBT-representatives. Beside Yannik Shetty from the liberal party NEOS - Das Neue Österreich, there are also two openly gay politicians from the conservative Austrian People's Party: Nico Marchetti and Martina Kaufmann.\n\nMuch speculation has been made about the sexual orientation of Jörg Haider, who took control of the right-wing Freedom Party in 1986 and then later created the more mainstream but still socially conservative Alliance for the Future of Austria. The controversy continued after Haider's death in an accident on 11 October 2008. In 2009, some Austrian publications were forbidden by a court injunction for \"breach of personal and privacy rights of Dr Jörg Haider\", and thus from making claims that Jörg Haider was not heterosexual.\n\nThe gay community is developed in all larger cities, such as Vienna, Linz, Innsbruck, Salzburg and Graz. Every year, the Austrian capital hosts Vienna Gay Pride, which includes the \"Regenbogenparade\", the \"Rainbow Parade\".\n\nMajor LGBT organisations include HOSI Wien, which was founded in 1979 and is Austria's oldest and largest gay, lesbian and bisexual association, The Austrian Lesbian and Gay Forum (ALGF), which was active throughout the 1990s, and Afro Rainbow Austria (ARA), the first organisation by and for LGBT migrants from Africa in Austria.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1799743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799743", "title": "International Practical Shooting Confederation", "text": "International Practical Shooting Confederation\n\nThe International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC) is the world's second largest shooting sport association and the largest and oldest within practical shooting. Founded in 1976, the IPSC nowadays affiliates over 100 regions from Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. Competitions are held with pistol, revolver, rifle and shotgun, and competitors are divided into different divisions based on firearm and equipment features. While everyone in a division competes in the Overall category, there are also own separate awards for the categories Lady (female competitors), Super Junior (under 16 years), Junior (under 21 years), Senior (over 50 years) and Super Senior (over 60 years).\n\nIPSC's activities include international regulation of the sport by approving firearms and equipment for various divisions, administering competition rules and education of range officials (referees) through the International Range Officers Association who are responsible for conducting matches safely, fair and according to the rules. IPSC organizes the World Championships called the Handgun World Shoot, Rifle World Shoot and Shotgun World Shoot with three year intervals for each discipline.\n\nThe sport of practical shooting originated from competitions in California in the 1950s with the goal of developing handgun skills for defensive use, but quickly evolved into a pure sport with little grounding in the original purpose. The sport soon expanded to Europe, Australia, South America, and Africa. IPSC was founded in May 1976 when practical shooting enthusiasts from around the world participated at a conference held in Columbia, Missouri, creating a constitution and establishing the rules governing the sport. Jeff Cooper served as the first IPSC President. Today there are over 100 active IPSC regions, making practical shooting a major international sport which emphasizes firearms safety highly. Through international rules concerning firearms, equipment and organizing of matches one tries to unite the three elements precision, power and speed, which is also the motto of IPSC that is (DVC), Latin for \"precision, power, speed\". Only full caliber firearms are used, i.e. for handguns 9×19 mm is the smallest caliber, and the competitors try to achieve most points in the shortest time possible.\n\nAccuracy and speed is reflected by the comstock scoring method, while power is reflected by the minimum power factor requirement. Competitors fire the stages one at a time, and the scoring system is based on achieving most possible points in the shortest time.\n\nThe scoring method is called comstock, named after its inventor Walt Comstock, which means that the competitor has unlimited time to complete the stage and can fire an unlimited number of rounds. The time is measured from the start signal until the last shot fired using special shot timers with microphones, and this way the competitor can influence the total stage time. Since the number of rounds is unlimited, the competitor can re-engage the same target in order to get more points, but at the cost of using more time. Usually, the two best scoring hits count for each target.\n\nCompetitors are ranked for each stage by their hit factor, which is the ratio of points per second. The hit factor is calculated by summing the points (target scores minus penalties) and dividing by the time used.\n\nformula_1\n\nFor example, if a stage has 12 paper targets, requires two scoring hits per paper target, and since an A-hit gives 5 points, the stage will have 12 × 2 × 5 = 120 points available. If a competitor scores 115 points and uses 25.00 seconds he will get a hit factor for that stage of = 4.6. The competitor with the highest hit factor wins the stage and gets all the available stage points (in this case 120 stage points), while other competitors are given stage points based on their hit factor percentage compared to the winner. For the overall match score, stage points are added for all stages, which means that each stage is weighted by how many stage points that are available.\n\nThe scoring method allows for a precise gradation of performances across the match, but requires a computer and software to do in a timely fashion. Matches can either be scored on paper and manually transferred to the official IPSC Match Scoring System (WinMSS), or can be scored directly on electronic devices like smartphones and tablets with the WinMSS Electronic Score Sheet (ESS) app or third party scoring systems like Shoot'n Score It or PractiScore.\n\nThe power factor is the momentum of the fired bullet as it's moving through the air, which contribute to the recoil of the firearm (together with the propellant gases stemming from the amount of gunpowder). Thus, the power factor in a way reflects recoil. The power factor must exceed certain thresholds, and is calculated by measuring the \"bullet speed\" using a chronograph and measuring another of the competitor's bullets on a weighing scale to find the \"bullet mass\", thereafter calculating the \"power factor\" by the formula:\n\nThe official unit used for the power factor is the imperial unit \"kilo grain feet per second\" (kgr·ft/s). \"Grain feet per second\" (gr·ft/s) can be obtained by measuring the \"mass\" in grain (gr) (equal to pound), and \"velocity\" in feet per second (ft/s), but since their product yields a very large number it is common to multiply by a factor of , obtaining the power factor in \"\"kilo\" grain feet per second\" instead.\n\nTo measure the muzzle velocity the competitor's ammunition must be fired in the competitor's firearm, since velocities can vary slightly from one firearm to another. In for instance handgun competitions, the ammunition must exceed 125 kgr·ft/s for minor scoring, and at least 160 or 170 kgr·ft/s for major scoring (depending on division). Extra scoring is not given for exceeding the threshold. A competitor declaring major, but who fails the threshold, have their score re-calculated at minor. A competitor who fails the threshold of minor is given a score of zero for the match.\n\nTo achieve a varied, challenging and exciting sport there are no fixed target arrangements, distances or shooting programs, making every match unique. Paper and steel targets can be mixed in the same stage, and may be static, moving or partially covered by targets called no-shoots that give minus points if hit.\n\nPaper targets have the three scoring zones A, C, and D with points per hit varying slightly depending on power factor. A center hit for both minor or major is five points, but hits in lesser scoring areas are rewarded more for major than minor with the A-C-D zones being scored 5–4–2 for major and 5–3–1 for minor (see table below). A competitor who has declared minor must therefore either shoot more \"A\" hits or shoot faster than one who has declared major in order to make up the scoring disadvantage.\n\nSome typical examples of moving target setups are swingers, bobbers, clamshells, movers, and drop turners.\n\nScoring of the targets is done by the Range Officer. For the competitor to get the relevant scoring value or penalty points, the bullet hole must at least touch the line of the scoring area. (Breaking the relevant scoring line is thus not necessary.)\n\nSteel targets score 5 points and must fall to be scored. (For rifle some steel targets may score 10 points).\n\nFor paper targets, the octagonal IPSC Target in typical cardboard color is used throughout all the disciplines, and a ⅔ scaled-down IPSC Mini Target is used to simulate a full size target placed at a greater distance. Additionally, the Universal Target can be used for rifle or shotgun, while the A3 and A4 paper targets are approved for shotgun matches only.\n\nFor steel targets, there are two standardized knock down targets, the IPSC Popper (85 cm tall) and the ⅔ scaled-down IPSC Mini Popper (56 cm tall). Metal plates are often circles between 20–30 cm in diameter or squares between 15×15 cm to 30×30 cm for handgun, and circles between 15–30 cm in diameter or squares between 15×15 cm to 30×45 cm for rifle and shotgun.\n\nFor many years IPSC was fired with whatever firearm the competitors chose, but as equipment became more and more specialized various equipment classes were introduced. The equipment classes in IPSC are called \"divisions\". All divisions fire the same stages, on the same days, as all other divisions, in a match. However, when calculating match standings, only divisional stage scores are compared. Thus, the top competitor in Open on a stage is the measure for all other Open competitors, the best Standard competitor is the measure for all other Standard competitors and likewise for all other divisions.\n\nIn handgun, there is currently one division for optical sights and four divisions for iron sights. The minimum caliber is 9×19 mm for all handgun divisions. During the competition the handgun must be worn in a holster securely attached to the competitor's belt. The holster needs to cover the trigger guard, the heel of the gun needs to be above the top of the belt and the belt has to be attached through at least three belt loops. Men must wear the holster, magazine holders, etc. in the belt at waist level, while female competitors may choose to wear their equipment either at hip or waist level. During the competition the position of the holster, magazine holders etc. can not be moved or adjusted from stage to stage. For all divisions except Open and Revolver the foremost portion of the handgun and all magazines must be placed behind the hip bone. Race holsters are permitted in all divisions\n\nOpen division is the handgun equivalent to the Formula 1 race car where most modifications are permitted to achieve a faster and more accurate gun. It's the only division which permits optical and electronic sights (such as red dot sights) and recoil reducing muzzle brakes (also called compensators). The division facilitates the highest magazine capacity, placing a restriction of 170 mm maximum overall length measured at the rear of any magazine. Shorter magazines, i.e. 140 mm, are also popular because of easier handling and often more reliable feeding, leaving the competitor a choice of equipment according to the stage at hand.\n\nOpen and Revolver are the only two divisions where 9 mm bullets (.355\") can be used to achieve major scoring, and hence .38 Super (or some variant) or 9×19 mm loaded to major power factor of 160 kgr·ft/s are popular cartridges for the pistols in Open. The 9 mm caliber cartridges provides higher gas pressures and better magazine capacity over 10 mm calibers. Open handguns are often expensive custom builds with parts and features specifically designed for competition, and with the maximum magazine length of 170 mm some 9 mm/ .38 Super magazines can hold up to 28 or 29 rounds.\n\nThe Open division was formally adopted at the General Assembly following the 1992 European Handgun Championship in Barcelona, Spain, and became a recognized division starting in 1993. Any handguns complying with the previous rules were included, for instance, there was placed no restriction on handgun size or type of sights. Later the 170 mm maximum length was introduced.\n\nStandard division allows any handgun that fits inside the IPSC box, and most modifications are permitted (except optical sights or compensators). Light match triggers are common, and modifications such as slide rackers, thumb rests (\"gas pedals\") and grip tape on the slide can sometimes also be seen. The IPSC box has internal dimensions of 225 x 150 x 45 mm in length × height × depth with a tolerance of +1 mm, −0 mm (approximately 8.86 × 5.91 × 1.77 inches). The handgun must fit with the slide parallel to the longest side of the box and hammer cocked if applicable. The handgun must fit the box with any of its magazines inserted, which means that for instance on 2011 pattern pistols either 124 or 126 mm magazines usually will give the maximum capacity and still fit the box.\n\nMinimum caliber for minor scoring is 9x19 mm loaded to a power factor of 125 kgr·ft/s while minimum caliber for major scoring is a 10 mm (.40\") cartridge loaded to a power factor of 170 kgr·ft/s, making for an interesting choice between minor and major scoring taken in mind the differences in recoil, magazine capacity and scoring points. An example of differences in magazine capacity depending on caliber can be seen when comparing stock 126 mm STI 2011 double-stack magazines, which according to the manufacturer yields a capacity of either 12 rounds for .45 ACP, 14 rounds for .40 S&W or 17 rounds for 9x19 mm. Magazine capacity can be further increased using aftermarket springs, followers and basepads as long as they still fit the box. For a 2011 pattern handgun, aftermarket parts and magazine tuning can increase capacity from 12 to 16 rounds for .45 ACP, from 14 to 19 rounds for .40 S&W and from 17 to 21 rounds for 9×x19 mm. It is a common belief that major scoring using the .40 S&W will give better scores for most competitors over the 9x19 mm, but at the cost of more expensive ammunition.\n\nThe Standard division was formally adopted at the General Assembly following the 1992 European Handgun Championship in Barcelona, Spain, and became a recognized division starting in 1993. One of the intentions of the Standard division was to create an own division for more \"stock\" firearms, since it up to then had been no equipment divisions, and the sport had started to become dominated by custom-built race guns with compensators and optical sights. However, the Standard division was later criticized for also having become a \"race division\" somewhat like Open, dominated by custom built guns and specialized gear. Major caliber .40 S&W dominates, since it is seen as a much better alternative scoring-wise, but is more expensive than regular minor scoring 9×19 mm (price difference varies, but usually 50–60% more expensive). Also, from a practical standpoint, the .40 S&W can be difficult to obtain when travelling to international matches, while the 9x19 mm round, on the contrary, is perceived as affordable and available all around the world. This made way for the Production division starting in 2000, which has minor scoring only, allows fewer modifications and has a common magazine limit of 15 rounds.\n\n\nProduction division is the most popular division as of 2016. The division allows very few modifications and is limited to typical \"off the shelf\" service pistols which has to be explicitly approved and listed on the IPSC Production Division List. Maximum barrel length is 127 mm (5 inches). The handgun must be double-action (DA/ SA, DAO or striker fired), and is required to have a minimum trigger pull weight. Striker fired handguns have a minimum trigger pull of 1.36 kg for every trigger pull, while DA/SA handguns are required to have a minimum trigger pull of 2.27 kg only for the first double action trigger pull (no weight limit for subsequent single action trigger pulls).\n\nProduction is the only division with minor scoring only, which means that anyone can be competitive with affordable and readily available 9x19 mm factory ammunition, without having to worry about handloading to make major. Together with (in general) affordable handguns, Production, therefore, makes for a popular division. Different models of handguns have variance in magazine capacity, but this is evened out by limiting competitors to load their magazines to a maximum of 15 rounds (15 in each magazine plus 1 in the chamber).\n\nPermitted modifications are limited to the application of grip tape in limited areas around the grip, replacement of sights that do not require gunsmithing to be installed (i.e. milling to the slide) and the replacement of internal components only available as a factory option from the original manufacturer. After-market magazines are allowed. Minor polishing and fitting of trigger components is permitted. Note that there are differences in approved handguns for IPSC Production division and USPSA Production division, as well as permitted modifications.\n\nFrom 2019, the Production division has been divided into Production, Production Optics and Production Optics Lite. Production Optics is based on the Production rules, but with an optical sight allowed. The optical sight can only be mounted to the un-modified slide. Racking handles or other protuberances from the optical sight or its mounting is not permitted. Regular Production handguns without optical sights can also compete in this division. Production Optics Lite is similar, except that the complete handgun must satisfy a weight limit of 1000 grams\n\nThe Production division was introduced at the General Assembly after the 1999 Handgun World Shoot in Cebu, Philippines, and became a recognized division starting in 2000. Production Optics was accepted as a trial division in 2017, and both Production Optics and Production Optics Lite were definitively accepted in 2018.\n\nIntroduced in 2011, the Classic division was modelled after the USPSA Single Stack division and is limited to handguns visually resembling the single stack 1911 form. The handgun with any of its magazines inserted has to fit inside the IPSC box. The competitor can choose between maximum 8 rounds per magazine for major scoring or 10 rounds per magazine for minor scoring. Minor scoring can be achieved with a 9 mm projectile loaded to a power factor of 125 kgr·ft/s, while major scoring requires a 10 mm or larger projectile loaded to a power factor of 170 kgr·ft/s.\n\nHandguns must have a one-piece metal frame, slide with stirrup cuts and the dust cover (with or without an accessory rail) can have a maximum length of 75 mm from the leading edge to the rear of the slide stop pin. Magazine wells cannot exceed a maximum outside width of 35 mm. Permitted modifications are shaped slides (i.e. flat-top or tri-top), shaped trigger guards (i.e. squared or undercut), bob-tail backstraps, bull or coned barrels, external extractors, finger-grooves (machined, add-on, wrap-around, etc.), custom magazine release buttons, triggers, hammers, single/ ambidextrous thumb safeties, any iron sights, extended slide lock levers and thumb shields provided they do not act as a thumb rest. Cosmetic modifications are permitted.\n\nProhibited modifications / parts are slide lightening cuts, weak hand thumb rests and slide rackers.\n\nIn the Revolver division double action revolvers in caliber 9x19 mm or larger of any capacity can be used. Muzzle brakes or optical sights are not permitted. Competitors may declare major with a 9 mm (.355\") bullet loaded to a power factor of 170, but a maximum of 6 rounds can be fired before a reload is required. From 2017, there is no limit on the number of rounds fired before a reload is required, but revolvers with a capacity of 7 rounds or more will automatically be scored as Minor power factor. It is common to use moon clips for faster reloads. The Revolver division was introduced at the General Assembly after the 1999 Handgun World Shoot in Cebu, Philippines, and was a recognized division starting in 2000, initially under the name \"Revolver Standard\" before it was renamed to \"Revolver\" around 2009.\n\nNow obsolete, the Modified division was a mix between Open and Standard. Handguns were allowed to have compensators and optical sights as long as they would fit in the IPSC box with any of its magazine inserted. The Modified division was formally adopted at the General Assembly following the 1992 European Handgun Championship in Barcelona, Spain, and became a recognized division starting in 1993. The division saw some use in southern Europe, but was otherwise not very widespread, and was retired after the 2011 World Shoot XVI in Rhodes, Greece. Competitors with Modified handguns would then afterwards compete in Open.\n\nImportant elements in rifle include the use of prone, off hand and supported shooting positions. Starting position is usually with the butt of the rifle touching the hip. Knowledge of the firearms ballistics is a key element to succeed at the long range targets. The recommended balance of target distances is that 30 percent of the targets are placed closer than 60 meters, 50 percent of the targets between 60 and 150 meters and 20 percent of the targets between 150 and 300 meters. Most competitors zero their sights at 200 meters. Being an outdoor sport, the weather can have a profound effect on competitor scores due to wind or different lighting conditions, especially on long range targets. Therefore, top-ranked competitors are often squadded together in order to achieve the most similar conditions.\n\nThere is no minimum caliber, but the ammunition has to make a power factor of 150 kgr·ft/s for minor or 320 kgr·ft/s for major scoring (formerly 160 and 340 kgr·ft/s respectively). Since two hits per target is normally required, rifles with minor power factor calibers dominate on the shorter ranges in most of the divisions due to less recoil and shorter recoil impulse. Minor ammunition being most common means that anyone can be competitive with affordable and readily available .223 Remington factory ammunition, without having to worry about handloading to make major. Ammunition loaded to major power factor has more recoil and a longer recoil impulse, but have the advantage of better ballistics at long range targets. Major scoring may be more competitive in the manual divisions since normally only one hit is required per target, lessening the importance of a small recoil impulse.\n\nIn the beginning, competitions were fired with whatever rifle the competitors chose, and while the type of rifles mostly has remained the same sighting systems have changed a lot. For a while rifles equipped with optics and iron sights competed side by side, but were divided somewhere around the 2000s into an Open division for optic sights and a Standard division for iron sights. Open and Standard were the only two rifle divisions until the 2004 season when similar divisions were introduced for manually operated mechanisms. The Open and Standard division was then renamed to Semi Auto Open and Semi Auto Standard, while the new manual divisions was named Manual Action Open and Manual Action Standard. Around 2011 a provisional division named \"Manual Action Standard 10\" was approved for evaluation as a testing ground for development of the Manual divisions.\n\nSelf-loading rifles are used in the Semi Auto Open and Semi Auto Standard division, while the manual divisions are limited to manual action types.\n\nSemi Auto Open, usually simply referred to as the \"Open division\", is the most popular rifle division. Optical sights are allowed together with bipods and muzzle brakes. Bipods can be taken on and off during a stage, and on some stages, it can even be advantageous to switch between different bipod sizes. Many top competitors use rifles with 46 cm (18-inch) barrels in order to run the longer rifle length gas system and achieve a softer recoil impulse. An adjustable gas system is popular. Some also use low-mass bolt carriers and buffer weights, which may, however, cause reliability issues if not tuned correctly.\n\nLow-power scope sights with a variable magnification starting at 1x are popular, with daytime bright illuminated 1–6x or 1–8x scopes being the most popular. Usually, only the center of the reticle is illuminated. Some reticles have milliradian-based wind holds or holdover marks to compensate for wind and bullet drop on long-range targets, while others prefer reticles with a simple dot and crosshair and choose to dial long-range adjustments on the turrets instead. Turrets are often exposed and lockable, having ballistic drop compensation (BDC) and a zero stop, while some competitors choose to use capped turrets for the wind adjustment. Important optical characteristics are true 1x or 1.1x low-end magnification, while on higher magnification it is important with a large field of view and a large exit pupil. Some other important scope qualities are weight and stray light performance.\n\nTo avoid having to adjust magnification up and down when transitioning between several long and short-range targets during the same stage, some combine a scope with a 45-degree side-mounted red dot optic, but the effectiveness of this is debated, and there are both top competitors who use it and not. For instance, Raine Peltokoski uses only one optical sight, and in such situations instead uses a technique called \"Occluded Eye Aiming\", where one blocks the objective (i.e. with a lens cover or by hand) so that one only sees the illuminated dot with one eye and the target with the other eye.\n\nRifles with non-magnified red dot sights as the primary optic also compete in Open and are very competitive at short ranges, but the lack of magnification is a big disadvantage at longer ranges.\n\n\nThe Semi Auto Standard division usually simply referred to as the \"Standard division\", tests the added skill of using iron sights only. Also, bipods are not allowed and muzzle brakes have to be within the maximum dimensions of 30x90 mm (approx. 1x3.5 inches). A long sight radius is desirable as it helps even target and sight focus due to larger depth of field, and thus iron-sighted rifles often have longer barrels with the front sight attached to the end of it. Many Standard top competitors use the longer 50 cm (20\") barrel over the 46 cm (18\") to achieve longer sight radius. Any iron sights can be used, and both \"globe\" and \"post\" front sights are popular, as well as aperture, ghost ring or diopter rear sights.\n\nThe manual divisions test the added skill of using a manual action, meaning that the rifles must be operated by physical manipulation, with some examples being bolt, pump or straight pull actions. Manual Action Open, usually simply referred to as the \"Manual Open division\", allows optical sights, muzzle brakes and bipods. Turn bolt actions require the competitor to perform both rotational and linear motions during the loading cycle, while pump- and straight-pull actions can be cycled back and forward without rotation of the bolt handle by the competitor. This reduces the number of movements from four to two, but comes at the cost of often having either poor or no primary extraction. increasing the risk of malfunctions. A turn bolt action on the other hand has a mechanical advantage used during chambering and primary extraction, which makes for more reliable feeding and extraction. Both types of mechanisms have won championships. Bolt action rifles usually also have a much shorter lock time than hammer fired pump and straight-pull actions, which can play a significant role in accuracy on long-range targets.\n\nManual Action Standard, usually simply referred to as the \"Manual Standard division\", is limited to iron sights only, and no muzzle brakes or bipods are allowed. Manual Action Standard 10 (MAS10) (between 2012 and 2017) was a trial division that allowed iron sights only, a magazine capacity of 11 rounds (10 in the magazine plus 1 in the chamber) and factory-fitted muzzle brakes only.\n\nStarting position is usually with the shotgun in one hand and the butt of the shotgun touching the hip. There is only one power factor of 480 kgr·ft/s, and all targets are scored as major which means that anyone can be competitive with affordable and readily available 12 gauge 70 mm (\") ammunition. Different options on shotgun chokes and ammunition (from different pellet sizes and up to slugs) makes for interesting choke and ammunition choices based on the stage at hand where the competitor has to consider the spread of the choke relative to the distance. All divisions have limits of the number of shells loaded at the beginning of the stage, but the limits are removed after the start signal. For instance, some may choose to run 10 or 11 round tubes in the Standard division which is limited to 9 rounds in the tube at the start signal.\n\nThe Open division allows optical sights, muzzle brakes, and is the only division that permits detachable magazines or the use of speed loaders for tube magazines. The maximum overall length of the shotgun is 1320 mm (approximately 52 in) measured parallel to the barrel. Detachable magazines must not contain more than 10 rounds at the start signal, while shotguns with fixed magazines may have an initial load of 14 rounds. After the start signal detachable magazines can be loaded up 12 rounds, while there is no limit for tube magazines.\n\nThe Modified division allows muzzle brakes and optical sights, but is limited to internal tube magazines. The maximum overall length of the shotgun is 1320 mm. Modifications of the floor plate to facilitate loading is permitted, given that the modification doesn't exceed 75 mm in length or protrudes more than 32 mm from the shotgun frame in any direction. Maximum 14 rounds can be loaded at the start signal (13+1, 13 in the tube plus 1 in the chamber), but more can be loaded after the start signal. Until 2017 the division was limited to iron sights, but from 2018 optical sights are permitted.\n\nThe standard division is the most popular division as of 2017. The division is limited to iron sights and internal tube magazines, and muzzle brakes are not allowed. The shotgun model has to be factory produced of at least 500 units. Maximum 9 rounds can be loaded at the start signal (8+1, 8 in the tube plus 1 in the chamber), but more can be loaded after the start signal.\n\nThe Standard Manual division, usually simply referred to as the \"Manual division\", is the only shotgun division limited to manual actions. Limited to iron sights, internal tube magazines, and no muzzle brakes, the shotgun model has to be factory produced of at least 500 units. Maximum 9 rounds can be loaded at the start signal (8+1, 8 in the tube plus 1 in the chamber), but more can be loaded after the start signal.\n\n\nThe safety of all competitors, officials, and spectators are always of the highest importance in competitions. Eye and ear protection are mandatory for both competitors and spectators. Firearms are kept unloaded until on the firing line under the direct supervision of a Range Officer, and can otherwise only be handled in designated safety areas. The safety area contains a direction with a secure backstop where competitors can handle unloaded firearms for example for packing or unpacking, holstering, cleaning or repair, dry firing or training with empty magazines. Handling of ammunition is expressively prohibited within the safety areas, including any dummy rounds. Outside the safety area, ammunition can be handled freely to load magazines, but firearms may only be handled under the direct supervision of a Range Officer. The strict separation of firearms and ammunition prevents accidents like accidental discharge (AD). Violations result in disqualification from the competition.\n\nA match consists of a mix between short courses (lowest number of targets), medium and long courses (highest number of targets). The approved balance for a match is a ratio of 3 short courses to 2 medium courses and 1 long course (i.e. 6 short, 4 medium and 2 long courses for a level 3 match). Since the number of targets dictates the available points for that stage, and therefore Long courses potentially can have a have great impact on the overall standings. Short courses have fewer points available, and tend not to be as critical for the overall standings. Short courses are often more technical, offer many different stage solutions, or include challenging elements such as \"empty chamber\" or \"empty magazine well\" starts, or \"non-freestyle shooting\" elements such as strong or weak hand only. Medium courses are something in between, while long courses will have the highest round count. Long courses tend to be more freestyle and straightforward as far as different stage solutions. The shooting challenges may still not necessarily be easy, and a match can be lost or won at a long course since there are so many points available.\n\nCompetitions are held at all levels from club matches and up to the world championships. Level 3 matches and up require official IPSC pre-approved match level sanctioning in regards to courses, IROA-range official, etc.\n\n\nThe World Shoots are the highest level shooting matches within IPSC. Held since 1975, it is a multi-day match where the best IPSC shooters from around the world compete for the World Champion title.\n\n\"Walkthrough\" refers to being inside the fault lines of a stage when not shooting, and is usually done by competitors for finalizing stage plans. Walkthroughs are restricted for equity reasons. Competitors are not allowed to enter or walk on the stages on their own initiative, but must be invited to do so by the Range Officer first after having received the stage briefing. After the stage brief, the squad as a whole is normally given between 3 and 5 minutes to walk the particular stage collectively. Afterwards, the command \"Time's up\" is given, upon which the first shooter is asked to load and make ready.\n\n\"On-deck\" refers to the competitor first in line waiting to shoot. The shooter second in line is referred to as being \"in-the-hole\". During scoring of the preceding shooter, the shooter on deck is usually allowed to take a final walkthrough.\n\nSo as not to disturb, spectators and other competitors should be still and remain silent while a competitor is preparing to shoot as well as during shooting.\n\nAfter a competitor has performed well on a stage it is common to receive soft applause. Such quiet clapping is the preferred form of applause for shooters; louder forms of applause are discouraged so as not to disturb other shooters who may be in the process of attempting a stage. Shoot-Off's are an exception to this.\n\nAfter having completed a stage and received scores it is common for the competitor to thank and shake hands with the Range Officer.\n\nCompetitors are divided into Squads that rotate between the Courses of Fire. A Super Squad refers to a Squad of elite and top-seeded competitors who are among the favorites to win a match. They often consist of two or more national teams who are handpicked by their respective national sport directors. Match favorites are required to be placed in Super Squads so that they get the most similar conditions.\n\nThe International Range Officers Association (IROA) is a part of IPSC with the responsibility to train and certify their own dedicated range officials, who are responsible for conducting matches safely, fair and according to the rules. In addition, each IPSC region have their own National Range Officers Institute (NROI) under the IROA. In a match range officials from IROA and NROI can work alongside in the ranks:\n\n\nThe International Shooting Safety Instructors Association (ISSIA) is a part of IPSC with the responsibility to train and certify their own dedicated safety instructors and coaches, providing supervision and training for both team and individual players. Safety instructors conduct mandatory safety training programs, while coaches are involved in administration, athletic and shooting training, competition coaching as well as representation of practical shooting teams and players.\n\nThe official ICS classification system (IPSC Classification System) allows athletes to be ranked both nationally and internationally based on previous results. Competitors are ranked from top to bottom as either Grand Master, Master, A, B, C or D. This way, shooters can measure progress and compare themselves with other shooters of the same classification in the match results. A classification is division-specific, and an athlete may, therefore, have different classifications in different divisions.\n\nIn order to be classified, you must first register an ICS alias which must be used when signing up for matches. An athlete is then classified within a division after the 4 first classification results. A classification result can be achieved in three ways:\n\nOnce initial classification has been achieved, the classification will be updated based on the average of the 4 best of the 8 last results. The ICS system is dynamic, and can change based on the results being reported. For example, a result from a CLS stage will at any given time be calculated based on the highest hit factor ever shot for that particular CLS stage. In order to maintain their classification, an athlete each calendar year at least have to achieve a result in either one classification match or two CLS stages.\n\nIPSC Rating.com is a third party rating service based on performance in actual competitions and advanced rating algorithms. Results from IPSC level 3, 4 and 5 matches plus major USPSA matches are processed, with the last IPSC World Shoot as the most trusted and representative source. Scores of competitors in other matches are compared to known \"key competitors\" who are already rated to achieve global rating percents. To be ranked one must compete in at least two level 3 matches, and old results will expire if they are not updated with following matches.\n\n\n"}

They were active from 1994 to 2000 and were known for their live shows. The name 'Symposium' originally referred to a drinking party (the Greek verb sympotein means \"to drink together\"), and was taken from the philosophical dialogue by Plato.\n\nThe band formed whilst still at school in Shepherds Bush, London, in 1994. The line up was: Ross Cummins (vocalist), Hagop Tchaparian (guitarist/backing vocalist), Joe Birch (drummer), William McGonagle (guitarist), and Wojtek Godzisz (bassist/vocalist/songwriter).\n\nThe band had a selection of uptempo punk pop songs which, together with their young average age of eighteen, bought them to the attention of Korda Marshall who signed them to Infectious Records in 1996.\n\nDebut single \"Drink the Sunshine\" in 1996 was followed by support from \"NME\", who placed them on the \"Bratbus Tour\" (an annual tour of four hotly tipped bands) which would visit universities in the UK. In March 1996, the band's concerts had been noted by Everett True, who put them on the cover of \"Melody Maker\", proclaiming them to be the \"best live band in Britain\". The band released a No. 25 UK hit single, \"Farewell to Twilight\" in March 1997. They also performed the song on \"TFI Friday\". This was followed by a headlining tour.\n\nThey released a mini album, \"One Day at a Time\", in October 1997, stating in \"NME\" that they \"just wanted to get them [the songs] out there\". The release alluded to the fact that their actual (full-length) debut album would be released at a later date. This was illustrated by the fact that one of the four singles they had released up until this point, \"The Answer To Why I Hate You\", was absent from the mini-album, but did appear on their first album \"On The Outside\". Having signed a recording contract with Infectious Records. \"Farewell to Twilight\" achieved a UK Singles Chart peak of No. 25, a position that they would never subsequently surpass.\n\n\"Fairweather Friend\" was the band's best known song, having support from a music video, and this led to a \"Top of the Pops\" performance. In 1997 the band supported a number of popular American bands, including Red Hot Chili Peppers at Wembley Arena, The Foo Fighters, The Deftones and No Doubt at Brixton Academy, where Cummins' stage antics caused him to dislocate his leg. The following year the band toured the United States on the Warped Tour with Bad Religion, NOFX and Rancid.\n\nTheir debut album \"On The Outside\" was released in May 1998. By the end of 1999 the band had left Infectious Records. After supporting Metallica at the Milton Keynes Bowl in 1999, Symposium released the \"Killing Position\" EP. By early 2000 the band had developed musical differences and broke up.\n\nMcGonagle and Birch formed the post-hardcore band Hell Is for Heroes, whilst Cummins eventually resurfaced in 2004 with Paper Cuts. The band's primary songwriter Wojtek Godzisz went solo and signed to Tigertrap Records in 2006. His eponymous debut album was released in 2009.\n\nHagop Tchaparian went on to work with the band Hot Chip. He is a consultant to the music industry.\n\n\n"}

Same-sex sexual activity has been legal since 1989, with an equal age of consent since 2001. Same-sex couples have had access to registered partnerships since 2011, and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has been outlawed since 2016.\n\nSame-sex sexual activity was legalized in 1989 by the removal of Sections 129 and 130 of the Criminal Code, though the age of consent was not equalized until 2001. The Penal Code was revised in December 2000 to remove all discrimination against same-sex sexual activity, taking effect in 2001. The age of consent is 14, regardless of gender and sexual orientation.\n\nIn 2001, the Free List, one of the three political parties in the country, worked on a draft for a same-sex partnership law. The paper was accepted by the Landtag and given to the Liechtenstein Government. Since 2002, the Penal Code has included same-sex domestic partners in the definition of \"next of kin\". The proposed registered partnership bill was rejected by the Parliament in summer 2003. A new proposal by the Free List was adopted by the Landtag with a majority of 19 votes to 6 on 24 October 2007. Justice Minister Aurelia Frick presented the draft of the registered partnership bill in April 2010. On 23 November, the Government approved the final version of the bill. On 16 December 2010, it was approved by the Landtag in the first reading. It passed its second reading on 16 March and was published on 21 March 2011. A group \"Vox Populi\" announced its intention to force a referendum on the matter. According to the Constitution, the organization had 30 days to collect at least 1,000 signatures. A referendum was held on 17 and 19 June 2011 and 68.8% of voters approved the law, which then went into effect on 1 September 2011.\n\nSince 1 January 2017, registered partners have been allowed to have a common \"name\" as equivalent to a \"family name\" for married couples.\n\nIn 2018, a gay couple filed suit in court, arguing that the same-sex marriage ban is in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Constitution of Liechtenstein. Although a court of first instance initially ruled for the couple, the State Court (StGH) ruled in September 2019 that banning same-sex marriage is not unconstitutional. However, the court concluded that several provisions of the 2011 partnership law were discriminatory, notably its provisions prohibiting civil partners from adopting their stepchildren (so-called stepchild adoption).\n\nSingle people regardless of sexual orientation are allowed to adopt in Liechtenstein, but neither stepchild or joint adoptions by same-sex couples are allowed. In September 2019, the State Court ordered the Liechtenstein Government to look into the legalisation of stepchild adoption for civil partners.\n\nOn 1 January 2016, during his annual New Year's Day interview, Prince Hans-Adam II announced his opposition to allowing same-sex couples to adopt children.\n\nOn 22 February 2005, following a department reorganisation, the Department of Equal Opportunities () was assigned to include discrimination on sexual orientation in its area of responsibility.\n\nThe \"Act on Media\" (), enacted in October 2005, declares that media content will be considered illegal if it incites or supports discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin, gender, religion, age, disability or sexual orientation.\n\nSince 1 April 2016, after a penal code change, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has been banned in Liechtenstein, punishable by two years imprisonment. Section 283(1) of the Penal Code states:\n\nSection 283(6) prohibits discrimination in public facilities on the basis of, among other categories, sexual orientation.\n\nGay and bisexual men are banned from donating blood.\n\nA gay and lesbian organization, Flay, was founded in 1998, and organizes social activities for LGBT people in the triangular area between Liechtenstein, Vorarlberg (Austria) and the Swiss Rhine Valley.\n\nPrivacy and individual rights are regarded as fundamental assets of Liechtensteiner society. Open and public discrimination against LGBT people is extremely rare and almost completely unheard of. Despite Liechtenstein's reputation as a conservative Catholic nation, same-sex couples and LGBT people more generally face little social differences compared to heterosexuals and are accepted and tolerated. The country is often compared to \"a huge family where everyone knows each other and minds their own business with little interference from others\". Due to the small population, there are no specific gay bars or venues.\n\nA 2017 online poll conducted by the \"Liechtensteiner Vaterland\" found majority support for the legalisation of same-sex marriage, at 69%.\n\n"}

Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina is a secular country composed of mainly Muslims and Christians (Catholic and Orthodox). While officially secular, religion plays an important role in Bosnian society. As such, attitudes towards members of the LGBT community tend to be quite conservative, much like other Eastern European countries. Many LGBT events, most notably the 2008 Queer Sarajevo Festival, have ended in violence, after Islamic radicals attacked the crowds and chanted extremist phrases. According to a 2015 survey, 51% of LGBT Bosnians reported some form of discrimination directed against them, including verbal abuse, harassment and even physical violence.\n\nNevertheless, attitudes are changing. In 2016, the Government approved a comprehensive anti-discrimination law, banning discrimination on account of one's sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. More and more gay bars and venues have opened, especially in the capital city of Sarajevo. Bosnia and Herzegovina's desire to join the European Union has also played an important role in the Government's approach to LGBT rights. The association ILGA-Europe has ranked Bosnia and Herzegovina 27th out of 49 European countries in terms of LGBT rights legislation.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina is governed by two political entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. Same-sex sexual activity was legalized in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1996 and in the Republika Srpska in 1998, by those two entities adopting their own criminal laws. The Brčko District followed suit and legalized homosexuality in 2003. The age of consent is 14, regardless of sexual orientation (having sexual relations with a person under 14 is considered statutory rape).\n\nThere is no legal recognition of same-sex couples on a national or subnational level. The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina remains silent on gender eligibility for a marriage, and on a subnational scale, both entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska, limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, as prescribed by their respective family codes.\n\nOn 19 October 2018, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) adopted a request for the legalisation of civil unions. \"The said item was on the session agenda and it was adopted in the same form as it was proposed,\" FBiH Prime Minister Fadil Novalić said. The Government will now form a working group to analyse the proposal, which will need to be later adopted by the Parliament. According to research, about 80% of Bosniak same-sex couples wish to have their relationships recognised.\n\nArticle 12 of the \"Law on Equality of Sexes\" (), adopted in early 2003, prohibits discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is not explicitly defined, however.\n\nThe labour law of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) also explicitly prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, as does Brčko District's labour law.\n\nThe \"Law Against Discrimination\" () was adopted in 2009, prohibiting discrimination based on sex, gender expression and sexual orientation. Furthermore, the law forbids harassment and segregation on the basis of sexual orientation. Article 2 of the law states as follows:\nIn July 2016, the Bosnian and Herzegovinan Parliament adopted a bill amending anti-discrimination laws to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics.\n\nIn April 2016, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina approved amendments to its Criminal Code by outlawing hate crimes on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The law was published in the official gazette on 15 June 2016. Similar bans already existed in Republika Srpska and the Brčko District.\n\nTransgender people may change their legal gender in Bosnia and Herzegovina after having undergone sex reassignment surgery and other medical treatments.\n\nQuite a few organizations have been working on LGBT rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Organisation Q (\"Udruženje Q\") was the first LGBT organization to register in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Organization Q works for \"the promotion and protection of culture, identities and human rights of queer persons\", and was founded in September 2002. It formally registered in February 2004.\n\nLogos was initially registered at the end of 2005 under the name of the Initiative for Visibility of Queer Muslims (IIVQM), but shortly after changed its name to Logos and re-registered in 2006. Equilibrium was registered in mid-2009 and was the first organization to work out of Banja Luka. Both organizations closed after two years.\n\nOther organizations include Okvir and Simosyon, which both registered in 2011, Viktorija, the Sarajevo Open Centre (Sarajevski Otvoreni Centar), BUKA (Banja Luka Association of Queer Activists; ) which registered in 2013, LibertaMo Association, which began working in 2015, and the Mostar and the Tuzla open centers.\n\nAs of October 2017, Bosnia and Herzegovina was one of only two Balkan nations (North Macedonia being the other) that had never held a gay pride parade. The country's first pride event was held on 9 September 2019 in the capital Sarajevo. An estimated 2,000 people marched in the first pride parade of Bosnia and Herzegovina, making the country the last former Yugoslavian nation to hold a pride event.\n\nApproximately a dozen individuals were attacked at the end of the first day of the Queer Sarajevo Festival on 24 September 2008. Eight people, one policeman included, were reported to have been injured after a large group of Islamic fundamentalists and hooligans attacked visitors and the crowds. According to the organizers of the four-day event, police allowed a non-approved protest and anti-gay protestors to get too close to the venue thus endangering the participants.\n\nThe festival, organised by Organization Q, opened in the Academy of Fine Arts in the centre of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The attacks forced the organizers to make the rest of the festival a private event and to cancel it a couple of days later. Although Organization Q had organized public events before, this festival was the first cultural event of this kind in history of Sarajevo.\n\nIn 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that the authorities had failed to protect the freedom of assembly of the 2008 festival participants.\n\nOn 1 February 2014, fourteen masked men stormed into the Merlinka Festival, shouting homophobic insults. Three participants were injured. Police arrived just after the attackers left, and were criticised for doing very little in finding and prosecuting the attackers. The festival continued the following day, with no incident, and with the full protection of the police force.\n\nA 2015 survey found 44% of Bosnians would try to cure their child if he/she came out as gay. Another 11% stated that they would stop communicating with their child altogether. It also found 30% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's population supported granting same-sex couples some rights associated with marriage, such as economic and social rights.\n\nAccording to a Pew Research poll published in 2017, 13% of respondents in Bosnia and Herzegovina supported same-sex marriage, with 84% opposed. It showed that 82% of Bosnians believed that homosexuality should not be accepted by society.\n\nAccording to a poll published in 2019, before the first gay pride parade in Sarajevo, 33% of respondents supported the parade, with 58% against. 14% of respondents stated that they supported the legalisation of same-sex marriage, with 81% opposed. The poll was conducted in Sarajevo Canton, not covering the rest of the country.\n\n\n"}

There are approximately one hundred winter counts in existence, but many of these are duplicates.\n\nMost winter counts have a single pictograph symbolizing each year, based on the most memorable event of that year. For Lakota people, years ran from first snowfall to first snowfall. Kiowa winter counts usually feature two marks per year – one for winter and one marking the summer Sun Dance. The glyphs representing significant events would be used as a reference that could be consulted regarding the order of the years. More extensive oral histories were passed down using the winter counts as guide posts.\n\nTraditionally each band would choose a single keeper of the winter count. Until the 20th century, these keepers were always men. They would consult with tribal elders to reach a consensus for choosing a name for the year. The keeper chose his successor in recording the count, who was often a family member.\n\nUntil the late 19th century, winter counts were recorded on buffalo hides. When buffalo became scarce, keepers resorted to using muslin, linen, or paper. The annual pictographs began on either the left or right side of the drawing surface and could be run in lines, spirals, or serpentine patterns.\n\nGarrick Mallery, a Smithsonian scholar, recognized that one of those events, \"The Year the Stars Fell,\" correlated with the Leonid meteor storm of November 1833.

At up to , the white-tailed eagle is the largest eagle in Europe. Bald eagles can weigh up to , making them the largest eagle native to North America. There are exceptional records of even heavier individuals in both the white-tailed and bald eagles, although not surpassing the largest Steller's sea eagles. The white-bellied sea eagle can weigh up to . They are generally overall brown (from rich brown to dull grey-brown), often with white to the head, tail or underparts. Some of the species have an all-yellow beak as adults, which is unusual among eagles.\n\nTheir diets consist mainly of fish, aquatic birds and small mammals. Nests are typically very large and positioned in a tree, but sometimes on a cliff.\n\nThe genus \"Haliaeetus\" was introduced in 1809 by the French naturalist Marie Jules César Savigny in his chapter on birds in the \"Description de l'Égypte\". The two fish eagles in the genus \"Ichthyophaga\" found to lie within the genus in a genetic study in 2005, and then placed therein. They are very similar to the tropical \"Haliaeetus\" species. A prehistoric (i.e. extinct before 1500) form from Maui in the Hawaiian Islands may represent a species or subspecies in this genus.\n\nThe 10 living species are:\n\nThe tail is entirely white in adult \"Haliaeetus\" species except for Sanford's, White-bellied, and Pallas's. Three species pairs exist: white-tailed and bald eagles, Sanford's and white-bellied sea eagles, and the African and Madagascan fish eagles, each of these consists of a white- and a tan-headed species.\n\n\"Haliaeetus\" is possibly one of the oldest genera of living birds. A distal left tarsometatarsus (DPC 1652) recovered from early Oligocene deposits of Fayyum, Egypt (Jebel Qatrani Formation, about 33 million years ago (Mya) is similar in general pattern and some details to that of a modern sea eagle. The genus was present in the middle Miocene (12-16 Mya) with certainty.\n\nThe relationships to other genera in the family are less clear; they have long been considered closer to the genus \"Milvus\" (kites) than to the true eagles in the genus \"Aquila\" on the basis of their morphology and display behaviour, more recent genetic evidence agrees with this, but points to them being related to the genus \"Buteo\" (buzzards/hawks), as well, a relationship not previously thought close.\n\nThe origin of the sea eagles and fishing eagles is probably in the general area of the Bay of Bengal. During the Eocene/Oligocene, as the Indian subcontinent slowly collided with Eurasia, this was a vast expanse of fairly shallow ocean; the initial sea eagle divergence seems to have resulted in the four tropical (and Southern Hemisphere subtropical) species living around the Indian Ocean today. The Central Asian Pallas's sea eagle's relationships to the other taxa is more obscure; it seems closer to the three Holarctic species which evolved later and may be an early offshoot of this northward expansion; it does not have the hefty yellow bill of the northern forms, retaining a smaller, darker beak like the tropical species.\n\nThe rate of molecular evolution in \"Haliaeetus\" is fairly slow, as is to be expected in long-lived birds which take years to successfully reproduce. In the mtDNA cytochrome \"b\" gene, a mutation rate of 0.5–0.7% per million years (if assuming an Early Miocene divergence) or maybe as little as 0.25–0.3% per million years (for a Late Eocene divergence) has been shown.\n\nA 2005 molecular study found that the genus is paraphyletic and subsumes \"Ichthyophaga\", the species diverging into a temperate and tropical group.\n\nNesting pairs of both the bald eagle and white-bellied sea eagle have been subject to live-streaming webcam footage.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1799820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799820", "title": "Cadent house", "text": "Cadent house\n\nIn astrology, a cadent house is the last house of each quadrant of the zodiac. A quadrant begins with an Angular house, (the house in which a chart angle lies) proceeds to a Succedent house and ends with a Cadent house. There are four quadrants in an astrological chart, providing four Angular, four Succedent, and four Cadent houses.\n\nThe Greeks called the cadent houses \"apoklima\", which literally means \"falling\" or \"decline,\" because the houses were seen to be falling away from the strength of the angular houses, which were considered to be most influential because of their perpendicular and oppositive relationships to the Ascendant. The word \"apoklima\" also carries a denotation of degeneration and decline. Our English word \"cadent\" comes from the Latin translation of \"apoklima\" and is the source of our word \"cadet,\" which originally meant a lesser branch of the family, or the younger son. \n\nCadent houses are therefore usually considered by astrologers as less fertile and productive places by their nature than either angular or succedent houses, and the planets located in them are seen as generally less powerful and comfortable. This view of cadency is universally found in ancient sources. For example, Paulus Alexandrinus says of cadent houses: \"stars [ed: i.e., planets] found in these \"zoidia\" [ed: i.e., houses] (3, 6, 9 and 12) become inharmonious. And sometimes they bring about hostile conditions, sometimes separations and banishments...\". (However, there are conditions when a planet in a cadent house can be brought up to its full strength, for example, by a reasonably close trine to a benefic planet, such as Jupiter).\n\nThe notion of cadent houses as weak and ineffective also persists in medieval and Renaissance astrologers such as Guido Bonatti and William Lilly, who labeled cadent houses \"poor and of little efficacy.\"\n\nThe four cadent houses are as follows:-\n\n\nIn the twentieth century, a concept called \"natural houses\" was popular, in which it was argued that each of the twelve houses of the astrological chart corresponds to a sign of the zodiac: the first house corresponds to Aries, the second to Taurus, and so forth, continuing through the chart until the twelfth house, which is linked to Pisces.\n\nEmploying \"natural houses,\" the third house would correspond to Gemini, the sixth house to Virgo, the ninth house to Sagittarius and the twelfth house to Pisces, and adherents of the notion borrow archetypal concepts from the signs and apply them to the corresponding houses.\n\nThe idea of numerological correspondences goes back at least as far as Pythagoras and surely was instrumental in the interpretation by ancient astrologers of the angular relationships each house has with the others, and especially with the Ascendant. This may account for similarities between the idea of Gemini and the idea of the third house. But the \"natural houses\" doctrine stretches these similarities to point which seriously distorts the original concepts. Hardly any of these zodiacal correspondences result in the same characteristics or dignities observed by earlier astrologers.\n\nFurthermore, using \"natural houses,\" cadent signs are seen to be very flexible and adaptive and correspond with the mutable signs of the zodiac. But this obscures the essentially weak and unfavorable nature of these houses. Planets positioned in them lack influence, and may even become malefic—that is, they may have an unfortunate effect.\n\nAncient astrologers had a very different view of the third house than a correspondence to Gemini would imply. The house's primary significance was for siblings—a meaning it retains today. But Gemini has no such meaning. For another thing, the third house was the \"House of the Moon Goddess\" rather than having any correspondence with Mercury, the ruler of Gemini. The Moon \"rejoiced\" in the third house—that is, it was very dignified if positioned there. The house was also the place of religious cults, particularly unconventional ones (possibly what we would now call the \"occult\") and had nothing to do with writing or speaking. It is true, however, that the Moon was much more involved in the ancient concept of the mind—particularly with memory.\n\nThe third house also had some connotation for travel but Crane postulates that this derived more from the fact that it opposed the ninth house, the house of the Sun, which had the major connotation for travel.\n\nAncient astrologers had a very dim view of the sixth house, which is called \"the house of bad fortune.\" Valens makes a clear connection between this house and thieves, beggars, foot soldiers and slaves. The house has always had a connection with sickness, and hence with suffering. One reason for this is because it is in a very weak angle to the house of the Ascendant, which is considered the house of life, vitality and health. The relationship of the sixth house to the Ascendant is one of \"aversion,\" that is, it cannot \"see\" the Ascendant from a point 150 degrees away.\n\nBecause of this weakness, the sixth house has also been connected with servitude and slavery, and it is for this reason, perhaps, that it has become associated with the most routine and arduous of work, and the sense of the workplace as an obligation to which people must report every day to do the work of others. This is the not by any means the house of vocation, or even of the professions. Animals, too, are considered to be the servants of man, and possibly the animals connected here are smaller because the sixth is the lesser of the two houses of misfortune.\n\nThe planet Mars rejoices in the sixth house. He is dignified when located in this house. Mars is considered a malefic planet, whose influence is often unfortunate and aggressive. Mars's joy in the sixth may have to do with his long connection with fevers and acute illness, but it is also true that Mars is the \"lesser infortune\" (Saturn is the \"greater\") and hence joys in the lesser house of misfortune.\n\nIt seems (according to this page) it is not sure in which category the philosophy of Mars in the sixth house belongs: is it the Christian, modern etc. astrology?\nThe same counts for the exaltations in the houses below.\n\nA very different view obtains for the Ninth house, which was called \"the house of the Sun God\" by ancient astrologers. This house has always been connected established orthodox religion and with journeys (which were often undertaken for educational purposes in ancient times.) The Sun rejoices here, and the Sun in late Hellenistic religions was regarded as the eye of God. Valens calls this house the \"pre-Midheaven,\" and gives it considerable influence. Both benefic and malefic planets are strengthened here.\n\nMedieval astrologers connect it with the Church and clerics, long sea voyages, books, learning, philosophy and dreams. This connection with dreams is quite ancient, and references to the ninth house in this capacity can be found in Firmicus and in Paulus Alexandrinus.\n\nWestern astrologers have always regarded the twelfth house as a very unfortunate place. Hellenistic astrologers called it \"the house of Evil Spirit\" and its reputation did not improve with the Arabs or with medieval astrologers. However, Saturn the \"greater malefic,\" does rejoice here—which means he has considerable dignity—and Valens says that Saturn in this place will bring considerable influence for honorable behavior. Paulus claims that an otherwise strong Saturn located here will bring success over enemies and joy in work.\n\nFirmicus connects this house with slaves, enemies and defects, and Valens connects it with destitution and beggary. The connection with very bad luck and material privation is almost universally found with the twelfth, as are enemies.\n\nIt is from the medieval astrologers that the connection of the twelfth house with imprisonment derives; the idea is probably Arab in origin.\n\nModern astrologers have brought a spiritual aspect to the twelfth house that was wholly absent in the earlier tradition. This may have its origins in the Theosophical revival of present-day astrology, which had some Hindu influence. In Jyotish (Hindu astrology), the twelfth house is very unfortunate, but is also connected with sexual activity and with spirituality. Hindu astrology is closely connected to the Hindu religion, in which material attachments of all kinds—which are certainly the enemy of all twelfth-house significations—are considered to be a bar to spiritual progress. Much has been made of this suggested affinity by some modern astrologers, especially those influenced by the 19th-century Theosophy movement, such as Annie Besant and Alice Bailey.\n\n\n"}

He was the youngest son of Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, chamberlain and first cousin of Queen Elizabeth I, and Anne Morgan, daughter of Sir Thomas Morgan and Anne Whitney.\n\nAs a young man he accompanied several diplomatic missions abroad and took part in military expeditions. In 1587 he joined in the attempt to relieve Sluys. In 1588 he served as a volunteer against the Spanish Armada, and commanded a regiment in the Earl of Essex's expedition to Normandy in support of the Protestant Henry IV of France in 1591, taking part in the siege of Rouen. He was knighted by Essex the same year for having by his intercession with the Queen procured his recall.\n\nIn the parliaments of 1586 and 1588 he represented Morpeth; in that of 1593, Callington; and in those of 1596 and 1601, Northumberland. From 1592 till the end of Elizabeth's reign he occupied various posts in the government of the Scottish borders, being appointed Warden of the Middle March in 1596, which he held till February 1598.\n\nThis was some of the most important work of his life, and he was largely responsible for easing the troubles and the depredations of the Border Reivers. His conflict with the Scottish \"fyrebrande\" Robert Ker, 1st Earl of Roxburghe was only settled after great skill and tact on Carey's part.\n\nIn March 1603 he visited the court, and witnessed Queen Elizabeth I's last illness, which he described in his memoirs. Anxious to recommend himself to her successor James I, and disobeying the orders of the council, he started on horseback immediately after the Queen's death on the morning of 24 March 1603, in order to be the first to communicate the tidings to James. He arrived at Holyrood late on 26 March, and was appointed by the King a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. But his conduct met with general disapproval and merited censure as \"contrary to all decency, good manners and respect,\" and on James's arrival in England he was dismissed from his new post.\n\nOn 23 February 1605, however, he was made governor of Prince Charles. Carey's wife, Elizabeth Trevanion (not Aletta Hogenhove who was the wife of his nephew Sir Robert Carey), a lady in waiting to Anne of Denmark, was responsible for the early training of the weak, stammering Charles. She taught the Prince, a late-developer, to walk and talk at the age of three, and was close to him throughout his life. Upon her husband's accession to the peerage, she became known as Dame Robert Carey, and is said to be the \"Old Dame Dob\" referred to in the Jack and Jill nursery rhyme, for her ministrations to the \"bruised\" King Charles I after his plan to raise revenue by lowering the volume of liquid in the jack (1/2 pint) and gill (1/4 pint) was foiled by publicans by simply making up the difference (up to the 1/2 pint line that is marked by a crown on pint glasses) with water.\n\nIn 1611, he was made the Master of the Robes to the Prince, in 1617 his Chamberlain, and on 6 February 1622, he was created Baron Carey of Leppington. In 1623 he followed Charles in his visit to Philip IV of Spain. Following Charles' succession to the throne he was created Earl of Monmouth in 1626. In 1621 he sat in Parliament for the last time as MP for Grampound.\n\nHe died on 12 April 1639. His eldest son by Elizabeth Trevannion, Henry Carey, 2nd Earl of Monmouth (1596–1661) succeeded him, and on his death without surviving male issue the peerage became extinct.\n\nHis \"Memoirs\" were published first by John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork in 1759. A second edition, annotated by Sir Walter Scott, was printed in 1808.\n\nA new edition was published in 2005, . \"The Stirring World of Robert Carey: Robert Carey's Memoirs 1577-1625\".\n\nRobert Carey married Elizabeth Trevannion, the daughter of Sir Hugh Trevannion and Sybilla Morgan, on 20 Aug 1593. They were first cousins, with Robert's mother Anne, being the elder sister of Sybilla. They had three children:\n\nPatricia Finney, writing as P.F. Chisholm, has written a series of historical mysteries featuring Sir Robert Carey, set during his time as Deputy Lord Warden of the Marches.\nAn elderly Robert Carey, supposedly speaking in 1626, narrates portions of George Garrett’s novel ‘’The Succession’’.\n\n"}

In 1979, he commenced a degree in Mathematics at the University of Dundee. In 1983, Pinto moved to London to work as a programmer writing computer games. He moved back to Edinburgh and then to Bristol working on game design. He became interested in creating the plot for games and wrote \"Kryomek\" and \"Hivestone\" as support material for tabletop wargames.\n\nWhile still at university around 1982, Pinto had written a 600-page manuscript which he later said \"contained a first, vague impression\" of what would become his \"The Stone Dance of the Chameleon\" series. After 10 years working the computer gaming industry he spent two years unemployed and teaching himself to write, during which time he developed his \"Stone Dance\" concept further.\n\nHis first novel, \"The Chosen\", was published in 1999. The sequel \"The Standing Dead\" was published in 2002 and a third novel, \"The Third God\", appeared in 2009, its completion delayed by the effects of a fire at the author's home. \"The Stone Dance of the Chameleon\" trilogy concerns the harrowing experiences of the young and inexperienced heir to a ruling dynasty who is suddenly taken from his protected childhood and thrust into a cruel society where he must fight for his family honour, his position and his life.\n\nAfter giving up designing computer games, Pinto said that he \"carried that discipline's world-building paradigm\" into his writing. Though interested in historical fiction, he chose to write in an invented universe so as not to be creatively constrained by the setting. He notes that the Masters of the \"Stone Dance\" series have aspects of the Roman emperors seen though a \"fairy tale lens.\" An initial conceptual idea was that the story was set in late Cretaceous period Antarctica, and some elements remain from this scenario.\n\nPinto has said that the books include his most deeply held political beliefs. He also felt that, despite possible commercial difficulties, his novels should include gay characters as a reflection of his own life experiences. He acknowledged that his ideas on writing and creating fantasy worlds had been influenced by the works of J. R. R. Tolkien and the \"Dune\" novels of Frank Herbert.\n\nPinto's \"The Stone Dance of the Chameleon\" trilogy follows young nobleman Carnelian as he is thrust into the dangerous political arena of the Three Lands. In this slave-owning civilisation of dazzling beauty and ancient ritual, the purity of noble bloodlines is paramount to the strict and ruthless caste system headed by the God Emperor and his Chosen. The faces of these self-indulgent Masters, held as deities, can never be seen unmasked by lesser people, under threat of immediate death. As the series begins, Carnelian follows his father Sardian, Lord Suth, from their outlying home to the capital of Osrakum as the current Emperor lies dying and a successor is to be named. Carnelian's own lineage puts him at the center of court intrigue, and in mortal danger.\n\n"}

The Mk 50, having been developed to counter very high performance nuclear submarines such as the Soviet Alfa class, was seen as too expensive to use against relatively slow conventional submarines. The older Mk 46, designed for open-ocean use, performed poorly in the littoral areas, where the Navy envisioned itself likely to operate in the future.\n\nThe Mk 54 was created by combining the homing portion of the Mk 50 and the warhead and propulsion sections of the Mk 46, improved for better performance in shallow water, and with the addition of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology to further reduce costs. It shares much of the software and computer hardware of the Mk 48 ADCAP heavy torpedo, based around a custom PowerPC 603e chip.\n\nDevelopmental testing began in July 1999, and a successful critical design review was completed in November 1999.\n\nIn April 2003, Raytheon was awarded a sole source contract for the production of the Mk 54. Full rate production began in October 2004. In March 2010 the Fifth Fleet requested improvements in the Mk 54's performance against diesel-electric submarines via an Urgent Operational Need Statement (UONS). This led to a software Block Upgrade (BUG) program which began testing in August 2011 and which continues, having been criticised by the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) for using unrealistic proxies for threat submarines.\n\nThe Mk 54 can be fired from surface ships via the Mark 32 surface vessel torpedo tubes or the vertical launch anti-submarine rocket (ASROC) systems, and also from most ASW aircraft, although they are slightly different lengths and weights. The P-8 Poseidon uses the High-Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapons Capability (HAAWWC) GPS-guided parachute kit to drop torpedoes from high altitude.\n\nThe FY14 DOT&E report assessed the Mk 54 (BUG) torpedo as not operationally effective in its intended role. \"\"During operationally challenging and realistic scenarios, the Mk 54 (BUG) demonstrated below threshold performance and exhibited many of the same failure mechanisms observed during the FY 2004 initial operational testing\"\". Shortfalls were also identified with the employing platforms’ tactics and tactical documentation, and interoperability problems with some platform fire control systems.\n\nThe Mark 54 is carried by the U.S. Navy and the Royal Australian Navy. In October 2010, Australia ordered 200 more torpedoes.\n\nIn June 2011, it was reported that India will get 32 Mk 54 All-Up-Round Lightweight Torpedoes and associated equipment, parts, training and logistical support for an estimated cost of $86 million through U.S. government's Foreign Military Sales program for P-8I LRMP.\n\nIn January 2018 it was announced that the P-8 Poseidon aircraft to be operated by the RAF will carry the Mk 54.\n\nIn early 2018 the U.S. State Department approved the sale of Mark 54 torpedoes to the Mexican Navy, who will deploy them from their new Sigma-class design frigates, the first of which is being jointly built with Dutch shipbuilding company Damen Schelde Naval Shipbuilding. \n\nIn April 2018, the US State Department cleared the sale of an additional 30 Mark 54 torpedoes to the Mexican Navy, which \"may\" be carried on MH-60R helicopters, which the Mexican Navy plans to order in the near future.\n\nIn May 2019 Canada requested 425 Mk54 lightweight torpedo conversion kits, plus ancillary training, exercise and maintenance spare parts. This procurement will allow Canada to upgrade its current inventory of Mk46 torpedoes. If the sale is finalised, the Mk54 lightweight torpedoes are expected to be used on the Royal Canadian Navy’s Halifax-class ships, and the Royal Canadian Air Force’s CP-140 Aurora aircraft. The torpedoes are also planned to be deployed from the CH-148 maritime helicopters.\n\n\n"}

The on-screen writer credit is given to Robin Bland, a pseudonym for script writer Terrance Dicks and script editor Robert Holmes. It is the first serial to feature the Sisterhood of Karn.\n\nThe serial is set on the planet Karn. In the serial, the surgeon Mehendri Solon (Philip Madoc) seeks to create a body for the Time Lord war criminal Morbius (Stuart Fell and Michael Spice) from parts of other creatures that have come to the planet.\n\nOn the planet Karn, an insect-like alien is killed by Condo, a man with a hook for a hand, who takes its head to a castle and his master Solon. However, the head is unsuitable — Solon needs a head from a warm-blooded humanoid.\n\nThe TARDIS materialises in the middle of a lightning storm, and the Fourth Doctor rushes out, ranting at the Time Lords for diverting him to this planet. Sarah Jane Smith finds the alien's escape pod and sees a valley filled with wrecked spacecraft, as well as the headless body of an alien which the Doctor identifies as a Mutt. She and the Doctor make for a castle that she spots. The travellers are welcomed by Solon, complimenting the Doctor on his \"magnificent\" head.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sisterhood of Karn discover the TARDIS and teleport it to their temple. Their elderly leader, Maren, identifies it as a Time Lord vessel, and believes that the Doctor has come to steal their Elixir of Life. \n\nThe Doctor knows of Solon as an authority on microsurgical techniques and tissue transplant. The Doctor recognises a clay bust as that of Morbius, one of the Time Lords' greatest criminals.\n\nBefore he can say anything further, a drug takes effect, and the Doctor passes out. Sarah Jane pretends that she has succumbed. In the laboratory, Solon's examination of the Doctor confirms that he is a Time Lord. As he and Condo leave the room, the Doctor vanishes. Sarah Jane keeps hidden and enters the lab. She draws back the curtain on a bed, thinking it is the Doctor, but as the lights come up, she sees a headless, patchwork creature made from various body parts.\nThe Doctor regains consciousness to find himself surrounded by members of the Sisterhood. The Doctor realises that just before he passed out, he felt the mind of Morbius. Maren refuses to believe him.\n\nSarah Jane follows Solon and Condo as they make their way towards the temple. They interrupt the ceremony, Solon asking them to spare the Doctor, or at least give him the Doctor's head. A disguised Sarah frees the Doctor, but she is blinded by the energy from Maren's ring, the Doctor assuring her that she will recover. Despite Sarah Jane telling him about the headless body, they return to the castle. The Doctor asks Solon to examine Sarah Jane's eyes. Solon tells him that Sarah's retinas have been almost completely destroyed, but there is one chance: the Elixir of Life. The Doctor goes to the Sisterhood.\n\nElsewhere, Sarah Jane hears a voice calling for Solon. Following the sound, she enters a hidden laboratory and stumbles blindly towards a glowing brain in a tank, which accuses her of being sent by the Sisterhood to destroy it. Solon enters and drags her away. As he closes the door, she hears Solon address the voice as \"Morbius\" and hears how Solon has sent the Doctor into a trap. She locks Solon in the laboratory and, still blind, makes her way out of the castle.\n\nThe Doctor is captured by the Sisterhood. When he explains why he came back, Maren tells him that the ray's effect is not permanent, and Solon knows that. The Doctor believes that something evil related to Morbius is happening. Maren affirms that she saw Morbius dispersed. The Doctor asks if Solon was present. Morbius had led an army of mercenaries, promising them the Elixir and immortality and revealing its existence to the cosmos. The Doctor reignites the flame with a \"Little Demon.\"\n\nSarah Jane is captured and taken back to the castle. Learning that the Doctor is a Time Lord, Morbius fears the Time Lords have tracked him down and will return in force. Morbius insists that he be transferred into the patchwork body now, with an artificial brain casing that Solon constructed. Solon protests, as there may be severe pain and seizures, but Morbius insists. Back in the castle, Solon prepares to operate, but Condo is enraged when he recognises his lost arm attached to the patchwork body. He attacks Solon before being shot in the stomach, their struggle knocking Morbius' brain to the floor. Not knowing what damage has been done, Solon places the fallen brain in the casing, releasing Sarah Jane so she can assist in the operation. He threatens her into doing so, saying that if Morbius dies, then so does she.\n\nThe wounded Condo crawls into the hallway as outside, the Sisters carry the Doctor's seemingly dead body through the lightning storm. In the meantime, the operation is finished — within minutes Morbius will live again. Solon goes to answer the doorbell, and sees the Sisters leaving the Doctor's body in the parlour. In the laboratory, Sarah Jane's eyesight starts to clear, but the monstrous body of Morbius gets off the operating table and lumbers towards her.\n\nSarah Jane screams as she sees the Morbius creature, and dodges out of the way. She warns Solon that the creature is loose and he runs back to the laboratory. Sarah Jane notices the Doctor's body, but as she approaches, the Doctor wakes up and smiles at her. He is here to stop Solon, but Sarah Jane tells him it is too late. But Morbius is revealed to not be in his right mind as he knocks Solon out and then the Doctor. Morbius chases Sarah Jane, but Condo intervenes, knocking Sarah Jane down the stairs into the cellar while he grapples with Morbius. However, Morbius is too strong, and he kills Condo instead. Morbius wanders out of the castle as the Doctor regains consciousness. He carries Sarah Jane into the secret laboratory to let her recover.\n\nSolon, too, has awakened, and assembles a tranquilliser gun. He tells the Doctor that the operation was not complete, only the motor functions are working, the rest on an instinctual level. Knowing Morbius' hatred, he will seek out the Sisterhood. Sure enough, Morbius finds one of the Sisters in some ruins nearby and kills her. The Doctor and Solon find the body and they search the ruins. Morbius attacks the Doctor, but is knocked out by Solon's tranquilliser. As they carry the creature back to the castle, the Doctor tells Solon that Morbius's brain will be detached and returned to the Time Lords.\n\nThe body of the dead Sister is brought back to Maren. Ohica reports that witnesses saw a creature and then the Doctor and Solon hunting for it. Maren realises that Solon has succeeded in his experiments and resurrected their ancient enemy. But Maren is too old and weak to leave the shrine, and she gives Ohica permission to lead the Sisters to the castle.\n\nThe Doctor gives Solon five minutes to disconnect the brain as he goes and checks on Sarah Jane. However, Solon locks them in the secret laboratory instead and begins to repair Morbius. Using materials from the secret laboratory, the Doctor makes cyanogen gas, which he then pipes through a vent that leads to the operating room above. Though Solon dies from exposure to the gas upon finishing the operation, Morbius' lungs filter out the poison as he goes to confront Sarah Jane and the Doctor — he claims that when the knowledge of his resurrection spreads, his followers will rise in their millions. The Doctor and Sarah Jane mock Morbius in an attempt to overheat his brain, and the Doctor challenges him to a mindbending contest.\n\nThey grab hold of the appropriate apparatus in the laboratory and begin. The machine's display begins to show Morbius' brain casing head, then his previous face, then the Doctor, then the Doctor's previous incarnation. After going through the Doctor's previous incarnations, a series of eight other faces are shown before Morbius' brain case shorts out. The Doctor collapses, as Morbius stumbles out in a daze. The Sisterhood arrive and chase Morbius over a cliff, and Ohica finds Sarah Jane crying over the Doctor.\n\nTaking the Doctor back to the shrine, Maren says only the Elixir of Life can save him, but there is none left. However, the revived Flame has gathered enough Elixir. There is enough for the Doctor, but not for Maren, who accepts that the Doctor was right: there should be an end. The Elixir is given to the Doctor, who revives almost immediately. Maren steps into the Flame of Life, becoming younger, and then vanishes.\n\nOhica starts to thank the Doctor, but he stops her, saying that he and Sarah Jane have another engagement. Before they leave, he gives her a pair of curious objects in case they need to relight the Flame again. When Ohica asks what they are, the Doctor answers, \"A mighty atom and a thunderflash.\" He explains that the writing on the cardboard tubes reads: \"Light the blue touch paper and stand clear.\" This time, the TARDIS vanishes in a puff of light and smoke.\n\nThe 2020 series finale \"The Timeless Children\" revealed that The Doctor is in fact a transdimensional foundling originally known as the Timeless Child, possessing an infinite capacity to regenerate but now retaining only memories from the incarnation known as the \"First Doctor\" (Hartnell) forward. The Time Lords developed the ability to regenerate by studying the Timeless Child's natural ability. The episode included a sequence where scenes from throughout the programme's run are used to represent the Doctor's recollection of her past incarnations, with the incarnations from \"The Brain of Morbius\" specifically included.\n\nThe original script was written by Terrance Dicks, using some ideas from his script of the stage play \"Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday\" to a requirement from Hinchcliffe for a story about a human/robot relationship. However, after delivery Dicks was out of the country when it was decided that the robot, core to the story, could not be realised under the budget constraints. In excising the character Script editor Robert Holmes had to undertake the substantial rewrites without informing Dicks, who could not be contacted. The robot character was replaced with Solon who required a different motivation—that of a mad scientist. Dicks later said of the decision that it was not original but it was the \"only one available\". Upon his return to the United Kingdom, Dicks learnt of the changes and angrily phoned Holmes. Since the work was more Holmes than his own, Dicks demanded the removal of his name from the credits saying it could go out under a \"bland pseudonym\". This ended up being the name \"Robin Bland\". \nThe episodes were recorded entirely in studios during October 1975.\n\nPhilip Madoc had already appeared in \"The Krotons\" (1968–69) and \"The War Games\" (1969) and would appear afterwards in \"The Power of Kroll\" (1978–79). He also had a role in the film \"Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.\" (1966) and appeared in the audio plays \"Master\" and \"Return of the Krotons\".\nColin Fay was a fortunate find for the production team: an opera singer by trade, he was a large man and, as a newcomer to television, cheap to hire. Other cost cutting included hiring only a single professional dancer who was copied in the scenes by actresses who had been chosen because of previous dancing experience.\n\nDuring the Doctor's mental battle with Morbius, the mind-bending machine displays two images of Morbius, then images of the Doctor's four incarnations as of the serial's production. These are followed by images of eight previously-unseen faces, intended to represent incarnations preceding the First Doctor. The Doctor's previous faces are portrayed by production unit manager George Gallaccio, script editor Robert Holmes, production assistant Graeme Harper, director Douglas Camfield, producer Philip Hinchcliffe, production assistant Christopher Baker, writer Robert Banks Stewart, and director Christopher Barry. Hinchcliffe stated, \"We tried to get famous actors for the faces of the Doctor. But because no one would volunteer, we had to use backroom boys. And it is true to say that I attempted to imply that William Hartnell was not the first Doctor\". After a complaint, the BBC paid a sum of money to the actors union Equity benevolent fund.\n\nThe season 14 story \"The Deadly Assassin\" introduced the idea that Time Lords are limited to 12 regenerations. The season 10 story \"The Three Doctors\", produced and aired before both \"The Brain of Morbius\" and \"The Deadly Assassin\", calls the William Hartnell Doctor the \"earliest Doctor\". Attempts to retrofit this with the number of faces seen in the mind test machine have brought about explanations including the possibility that the faces were Morbius' previous incarnations, younger versions of the First Doctor, or the Doctor's potential future incarnations. The Virgin Missing Adventure \"Cold Fusion\" by Lance Parkin implies that one of these prior Doctors was the incarnation of the Doctor active at the time of the birth of Susan Foreman. However, the subsequent Virgin New Adventures novel \"Lungbarrow\" states that Hartnell's Doctor was the first, implying instead that the faces represent incarnations of the Other, one of the founders of Time Lord civilisation, of whom the Doctor is the reincarnation..\n\nAn explanation resembling the \"Lungbarrow\" explanation was later given for them in \"The Timeless Children\" (2020).\n\nIt has been suggested that there are many thematic links to Mary Shelley's novel \"Frankenstein\".\n\nUpon the story's original broadcast, Mary Whitehouse (of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association) complained of the violence displayed; she was quoted saying that \"The Brain of Morbius\" \"contained some of the sickest and most horrific material seen on children's television\". At the time the programme was under close scrutiny by the NVALA; complaints centred on the shooting of Condo by Solon with a resulting spurt of blood.\n\nThe story was repeated on BBC1 at 5:50 pm on 4 December 1976, edited and condensed into a one-hour-long omnibus episode. This edit—done without the director's participation—was similar (but not exactly the same) to the one used for the 1984 video release. The omnibus repeat was seen by 10.9 million viewers, a higher audience than the original episodic broadcast.\n\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995), \"A superb exploration of gothic themes. Philip Madoc's portrayal of Solon is crucial to the story's success, and the pseudonymous epithet 'bland' is not at all deserved.\" In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J Howe and Stephen James Walker praised Madoc as Solon and the sets, and noted that the violence was realistic but adult. Together with Mark Stammers in the \"Fourth Doctor Handbook\" they described it as \"everything a good piece of drama should be: entertaining, enjoyable, effective and emotional\" In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" noted that Solon's insistence that he only use the Doctor's head was \"a fundamental lapse in logic\", but otherwise said that the serial was \"a salivating treat\". \"The A.V. Club\" reviewer Christopher Bahn found some minor problems in the script, but gave a positive review of the story, pointing out how it did not ripoff classic stories but repurposed them. DVD Talk's David Cornelius gave the serial four out of five stars, saying that it \"allows for a wide range of storytelling tones without feeling cluttered or uneven\" though at points the \"silliness\" of the Morbius costume threatened to \"overtake\" the story.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in June 1977. An unabridged reading of the novelisation by actor Tom Baker was released on CD in February 2008 by BBC Audiobooks.\n\nDicks also wrote a second adaptation for younger readers that was published in 1980 as \"Junior Doctor Who and the Brain of Morbius\". A French translation of the full novelisation was published in 1987.\n\nThe serial was released on VHS in a 58min heavily edited omnibus format in July 1984 and complete in episodic form in July 1990. The edited version was also released on Betamax, Video 2000, and Laserdisc. The story was released in complete form on DVD on 21 July 2008.\n"}

{"id": "1799854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799854", "title": "Myrica gale", "text": "Myrica gale\n\nMyrica gale is a species of flowering plant in the family Myricaceae, native to northern and western Europe and parts of northern North America. Common names include bog-myrtle sweet willow, Dutch myrtle, and sweetgale. \n\n\"Myrica gale\" is a deciduous shrub growing to 1–2 m tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, simple, 2–5 cm long, oblanceolate with a tapered base and broader tip, and a crinkled or finely toothed margin. The flowers are catkins, with male and female catkins on separate plants (dioecious). The fruit is a small drupe.\n\nIt typically grows in acidic peat bogs, and to cope with these difficult nitrogen-poor growing conditions, the roots have nitrogen-fixing actinobacteria which enable the plants to grow.\n\nThe foliage has a sweet resinous scent and is a traditional insect repellent, used by campers to keep biting insects out of tents. It is also a traditional component of Royal Wedding bouquets and is used variously in perfumery and as a condiment.\n\nIn north-western Europe (Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands), it was much used in a mixture called gruit as a flavouring for beer from the Middle Ages to the 16th century, but it fell into disuse after hops supplanted gruit herbs for political and economic reasons. In modern times, some brewers have revisited this historic technique and in Denmark and Sweden the plant is commonly used to prepare home-flavoured schnaps.\n\nIn some native cultures in Eastern Canada, the plant has been used as a traditional remedy for stomach aches, fever, bronchial ailments and liver problems. \"The Creole Doctor\", an 1886 article by Lafcadio Hearn, discusses the uses of the plant, known locally as \" ,\" in Louisiana creole folk remedies. In Scotland it has been traditionally used to ward off the Highland midge, and it is marketed as an insect repellent and as an ingredient in some soaps.\n\nIn 2007 there were plans to increase production of the plant in Scotland for use as an essential oil for treating sensitive skin and acne. The plant has been listed as an abortifacient and therefore should not be consumed by women who are, or might be, pregnant.\nSweetgale can grow in a narrow band in the intertidal zone, especially if logs have been washed into the estuary on which to establish itself. It is a favorite food of beavers, and low beaver dams can be found in the intertidal zone if sufficient sweetgale is present. The ponds thus formed are often completely submerged at high tide but retain enough water at low tide to provide refuge for fish. If too deep for predation by wading birds juvenile salmon may flourish.\n\n"}
{"id": "1799856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799856", "title": "Adam Liszt", "text": "Adam Liszt\n\nAdamus List () (16 December 177628 August 1827) was the father of composer and pianist Franz Liszt.\n\nAs the second child of Georg Adam List and Katharina née Baumann he was born in Edelstal (Nemesvölgy), a village close to the Austrian border in the Kingdom of Hungary. His family was partly of Danube Swabian German descent. See Life of Franz Liszt. There are Germanic, Slavic and Magyar claims of the Liszt family. They lived in Marcz, Nagymarton and also Malacka, Kingdom of Hungary (today Marz, Mattersburg in Burgenland, Austria and Malacky in Slovakia).\n\nGeorg was in service for the Hungarian Nikolaus II, Prince Esterházy and both he and his son, Adam, were Hungarian citizens. The family lived mostly in the German speaking parts of Hungary, which is why they had only rudimentary knowledge of Hungarian. Franz tried to learn the common tongue of his kingdom in the 1870s, but in spite of his great language skills he couldn't reach a fluent level.\n\nIn his youth Adam changed his surname \"List\" to the spelling \"Liszt\", according to Hungarian pronunciation. In his lifetime, Latin, not Hungarian, was the administrative language of the multi-ethnic Kingdom of Hungary, hence the recorded Latinised name \"Adamus\". After the great success of his son Franz, the father Georg also started to use the surname Liszt in the 1820s. Other family members also adapted this form, e.g. Adam's brother, Eduard, father of Franz von Liszt.\n\nAs a teenager, he played cello in the House of Eszterházy summer orchestra under the direction of Joseph Haydn. He was also an amateur pianist, and played the organ and violin and sang in a choir. His brother Eduard and one sister Barbara also showed great musical talents, as did their father Georg, who worked as an organist and played the piano and violin, but they had few resources for musical education other than within the family. After graduating from the Archigymnasium Regium Posoniense (today Gamča) in Pressburg (Bratislava), Adam entered the Franciscan Order, but two years later, by his petition in 1797, was released from the order. Adam still kept a close relationship with the order, which probably gave him the inspiration to name his son Franz.\n\nAn attempt by Adam to continue as a student of philosophy at the University of Pressburg ended in the first year due to financial reasons. He had to look for a job, and in 1798 became a clerk at the Esterhazy estate in Forchtenau (today's Forchtenstein). After two years, Adam was transferred to Kapuvár (Kobrunn) where he was missing the musical atmosphere at Eisenstadt (Kismarton). He started to compose music and dedicate it to the Prince in order to be transferred back to the Western part of Sopron county. Only in 1805 did he finally succeed in getting a job at the court in Eisenstadt. The years in Eisenstadt were his happy years. In his spare time he played cello in the orchestra led by Johann Nepomuk Hummel, the successor of Haydn, and had the opportunity to work with many musicians who came to Eisenstadt to perform, including Cherubini and Beethoven. This happy time ended when in 1809 Adam was transferred to the Esterházy estate of Raiding as an overseer of the herd of about 50,000 sheep (\"Rentmeister der Fürstlich Esterházyschen Schäferei\"). Raiding, only 30 miles from Eisenstadt, was a rather provincial place.\n\nWhile visiting his father in Mattersburg in the summer of 1810, Adam met Anna Lager who had recently moved from Vienna to Mattersburg. Their marriage took place in the parish of Unterfrauenhaid on 11 January 1811.\n\nThe only child of the couple, Franz Liszt, was born on 22 October 1811. Adam's father Georg wrote to prince Esterházy in 1812 that Adam had 3 more children, but there is no other documentation about this, and it seems unlikely.\n\nAt his house in Raiding, Adam staged chamber concerts. When Franz was 5 and his musical genius revealed itself, when following his father's musical work, Adam started to teach him music. When his fame grew, sponsors could finance private education in Vienna for the young Franz. Franz's father stayed close to his son throughout his travels to Vienna and Paris, where they settled in 1823. The purpose was to let Franz study at the famous Conservatoire de Paris, but Cherubini told them that foreigners weren't admitted. (Long after this piece of unintentional satire, Liszt would always scorn the conservatoires and their products). So Adam continued to teach his son, with a rigid schedule of practising Bach and other composers on the piano, with transposition of fugues and other daily technique improving exercises. After resigning from the Esterhazys' service Adam spent most of his time as the manager of his son's career, with tours in many European countries. Franz found his father's supervision quite demanding. (He may also have become the main breadwinner through giving lessons and concerts). Adam was a skilful business manager. It is possible that the father wanted the opportunities for his son that service with the Esterhazys had blocked for him. Adam secured him lessons with Paer (composition), Salieri (singing) and, mainly, Czerny (piano). Adam had known Czerny and Beethoven from his own musical days. Through Czerny Adam secured his son a meeting with Beethoven and Czerny seems to have persuaded his master to go to a concert where the young man was playing. Liszt was devastated by Adam's death and withdrew to a monastery for a time. His mother, Anna Lager came to look after him in Paris where she remained until her death in the 1860s. He soon became an established performer and teacher who was able to introduce Chopin to the musical world on his arrival in Paris in 1830.\n\nAdam was the main influence on Franz in his early years, as both teacher and manager. Liszt's full musical maturity was reached after his father died, when he heard the works of such composers as Mendelssohn, Schubert and Schumacher. The big influence on his performing style once Adam was gone came from his meetings with the forty year old Paganini. Though he always honoured the memory of Adam, who had been accused by the French gutter press of exploiting the child prodigy, he never visited Adam's grave at Boulogne-sur-Mer.\n\nÁdám died in 1827 in Boulogne-sur-Mer at the age of 50 when Franz was 15 years old. The two were staying at a retreat centre for Franz to rest after a physician's order; however, the father became fatally ill with typhoid fever, died and was buried there. Franz composed a funeral piece for his father's funeral service.\n"}

Covering , it contains more than 600 species of plants, including more than 100 bromeliads, in cultivated gardens.\n\nEstablished by President Trevor Colbourn in 1983, The Arboretum began with approximately of a disturbed pond pine community on the east side of the developed part of campus, east of the present biology building. In 1988, at President Altman’s direction, the University expanded the Arboretum to include a Cypress dome, an oak hammock of about , and about of sand pine and Florida scrub, connected to the original Arboretum by Sabal palmetto community and increasingly rare Florida longleaf pine flatwoods. During this time the director of the Arboretum was Dr. Henry O. Whittier. He would remain director of the Arboretum until his retirement in 2003, when Dr. Whittier was replaced as director by Dr. Martin Quigley, who served as director until 2009. In 2009, the Arboretum established a 0.15-ha organic community garden. In 2010, Dr. Patrick Bohlen was hired as the Director of Landscape and Natural Resources and Arboretum.\n\nEast of Orlando, and about five miles (8 km) north of State Route 50 on Alafaya Trail, The University of Central Florida occupies approximately of east central Florida natural habitats, including some of the last elevated land (about above sea level) before the St. Johns River, which lies between the campus and the coast. \nElevations range from about to above sea level, and more than two thirds of the campus has been described as wetlands, under the protection of the St. Johns River Water Management District.\nThe northeast and southeast sections of campus are wetland preserves whose waters flow east and north into the little Econlockhatchee River, which in turn flows into the Big Econlockhatchee before it joins with the St. Johns River near State Highway 46.\n\nThe elevated northwest corner of campus is geologically ancient coastline ridge which, because of its excellent water drainage, includes nature preserve containing a small remnant of the easternmost longleaf pine and American turkey oak association in central Florida. Most of the American turkey oak has disappeared from the highest part of the ridge, occupied by Alafaya trail. Intermittent or Shallow ponds and a small lake, Lake Claire, lie immediately to the east. A small beach and some picnic pavilions are maintained for campus recreation.\n\nOn the east side of campus, east of Gemini blvd and south of Orion blvd, lies a Cypress dome, an oak hammock of about , about of sand pine and wild rosemary scrub, and of pine flatwoods.\n\nWild rosemary scrub and longleaf pine flatwoods habitats are eminently suitable for construction, but the great majority of Florida endemic (unique) species are found in these habitats. The presence of these habitats within the Arboretum provides important opportunities for the introduction and preservation of threatened or endangered species.\n\nThe flatwoods are so flat that after heavy rains in may take water one or two days to drain off – so flat that the land slopes at a rate of not much more than 2-3 inches per mile! The vegetation may look pretty boring from the highway, but that’s because of the repetitiveness of widely spaced longleaf pines and the apparent continuity of the saw palmetto and occasional shrubby oaks, lyonias, and hollies. \nOn foot, walking the narrow trails through this habitat in different months of the year, the person taking the time for a closer look sees a wide variety of more seasonal plants which includes wild orchids, pitcher plants, sundews, bladderworts, lobelias, mints, tar flowers, blueberries, and others.\n\nTo maintain this biodiversity, the flatwoods and scrub ecosystems require fire to help clean up the dead and dried-up plant material that after some time can completely cover the ground. When these materials are burnt they return their nutrients back into the ground as ash and the next generation of flowers and grasses can emerge and thrive. This is the continuous cycle of growth, fire, and regeneration that these ecosystems need to be healthy.\n\nThe Arboretum currently has approximately of walking/biking trails through the scrub and longleaf communities. The Natural Areas are open to the public from sunrise to sunset, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Pets are allowed as long as they are kept under control and on a leash. Group tours are available by reservation. Volunteer opportunities are also available with more information available at the website.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1799879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799879", "title": "Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden", "text": "Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden\n\nLeopold (29 August 1790 – 24 April 1852) succeeded in 1830 as the Grand Duke of Baden, reigning until his death in 1852.\n\nAlthough a younger child, Leopold was the first son of Margrave Karl Friederich of Baden by his second, morganatic wife, Louise Karoline Geyer von Geyersberg. Since Luise Karoline was not of equal birth with the Margrave, the marriage was deemed morganatic and the resulting children were perceived as incapable of inheriting their father's dynastic status or the sovereign rights of the Zähringen House of Baden. Luise Karoline and her children were given the titles of baron and baroness, in 1796 count or countess von Hochberg.\n\nBaden gained territory during the Napoleonic Wars. As a result, Margrave Karl Friederich was elevated to the title of Prince-Elector within the Holy Roman Empire. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, he took the title Grand Duke of Baden.\n\nSince the descendants of Charles Frederick's first marriage to Karoline Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt were at first plentiful, no one expected the Hochberg children of his second wife to be anything except a family of counts with blood ties to the grand ducal family, but lacking dynastic rights. Count Leopold von Hochberg was born in Karlsruhe, and with no prospects of advancement in Baden, followed a career as an officer in the French army.\n\nThe situation of both the grand duchy and the Hochberg children became objects of international interest as it became apparent that the Baden male line descended from Karl Frederick's first wife was likely to die out. One by one, the males of the House of Baden expired without leaving male descendants. By 1817, there were only two males left, the reigning Grand Duke Charles I, a grandson of Charles Frederick's, and his childless uncle Prince Louis. Both of Charles's sons died in infancy. Baden's dynasty seemed to face extinction, casting the country's future in doubt.\n\nUnbeknownst to those outside of the court at Baden, upon the 24 November 1787 wedding of then-Margrave Charles Frederick to Luise Karoline Geyer von Geyersberg, he and the three sons of his first marriage signed a declaration which reserved decision on the title and any succession rights of sons to be born of the marriage. Although Luise Karoline's children were not initially legally recognised as of dynastic rank, on 20 February 1796 their father clarified in writing (subsequently co-signed by his elder sons) that the couple's sons were eligible to succeed to the margravial throne in order of male primogeniture after extinction of the male issue of his first marriage. The Margrave further declared that his marriage to their mother must \"in no way be seen as morganatic, but rather as a true equal marriage\".\n\nOn 10 September 1806, after the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire and the assumption of full sovereignty, Charles Frederick confirmed the dynastic status of the sons of his second marriage. This act was, yet again, signed by his three eldest sons, but was not promulgated.\n\nOn 4 October 1817, as neither Grand Duke Charles nor the other sons from his grandfather's first marriage had surviving male descendants, Charles proceeded to confirm the succession rights of his hither-to morganatic half-uncles, elevating each to the title Prince and Margrave of Baden, and the style of \"Highness\". He asked the princely congress in Aachen on 20 November 1818, just weeks before his death, to confirm the succession rights of these sons of his step-grandmother, still known as Countess Luise von Hochberg.\n\nBut this proclamation of Baden's succession evoked international challenges. The Congress of Vienna had, in 1815, recognised the claims of Bavaria and Austria to parts of Baden which it allocated to Charles Frederick in the Upper Palatinate and the Breisgau, anticipating that upon his imminent demise those lands would cease to be part of the Grand Duchy. Moreover, the Wittelsbach king of Bavaria, Maximilian I Joseph, was married to Grand Duke Charles's eldest sister, Caroline of Baden. The female most closely related to the last male of a German dynasty often inherited in such circumstances, in accordance with Semi-Salic succession law. As a result, Maximilian had a strong claim to Baden under the customary rules of inheritance, as well as his claims under a post–Congress of Vienna treaty of 16 April 1816.\n\nNonetheless, in 1818 Charles granted a constitution to the nation, the liberality of which made it popular with the people of Baden and which included a clause securing the succession rights of the offspring of Luise Karoline Geyer von Geyersberg. Another dispute was resolved by Baden's agreement to cede a portion of the county of Wertheim, already enclaved within Bavaria, to that kingdom.\n\nTo further improve the status of Prince Leopold, his half-brother the new Grand Duke Louis I arranged for him to marry his great-niece, Sophie, daughter of former King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden by Grand Duke Charles's sister, Frederica. Since Sophie was a granddaughter of Leopold's oldest half-brother, Charles Louis, this marriage united the descendants of his father's (Grand Duke Charles Frederick's) two wives. Sophie's undoubted royal blood would help to offset the stigma of Leopold's morganatic birth.\n\nFinally, on 10 July 1819, a few months after Charles's death, the Great Powers of Austria, France, Great Britain, Prussia and Russia joined with Bavaria and Baden in the 1819 Treaty of Frankfurt which recognized the succession rights of the former Hochberg morganatic line.\n\nWhen Louis I died on 30 March 1830, he was the last male of the House of Baden not descended from the morganatic marriage of Charles Frederick and Luise Karoline Geyer von Geyersberg. Leopold von Hochberg now succeeded as the fourth Grand Duke of Baden.\n\nLeopold was interested in the liberal ideas of his time, granted concessions to his subjects in 1848, and in the spring of 1849 declined to oppose the movement (see Revolutions of 1848 in the German states) which finally broke down all barriers and forced him to flee from the country on the night of 13 May. In August, he was reinstated by the troops of Prussia and the German Confederation. He acted with the greatest forbearance after regaining his power. During the last years of his reign, he admitted his son Frederick, who later succeeded him, to a share in the government. He died in Karlsruhe.\n\nOn 25 July 1819, Leopold married in Karlsruhe his half-grand-niece Sophie of Sweden (21 May 1801 – 6 July 1865). Sophia and Leopold had the following children:\n\n\nThe title and rank of Leopold and the other children of Grand Duke Charles Frederick by his second, morganatic wife, Luise Karoline Geyer von Geyersberg was initially ambiguous as stipulated in his parents' marriage contract (co-signed by his dynastic half-brothers at their father's behest), the daughters at least bearing their mother's (inaccurately attributed) baronial title, while only legally acquiring the title of \"Reichsgraf von Hochberg\" from 1796 when she was granted that rank by the Holy Roman Emperor. Leopold and his full siblings were not officially elevated to the title of \"margrave\" until 1817 when they were publicly de-morganitised. But their father had, in fact, allowed its use for his morganatic children at his own court in Karlsruhe at least from his assumption of the grand ducal crown in 1806, simultaneously according the princely title to the dynastic sons of his first marriage. However, from 1817 his male-line descendants of both marriages were internationally recognised as entitled to the princely prefix, which all used henceforth.\n\nThe title of \"Margrave of Baden\" has been borne as a title of pretence by Leopold's seniormost descendant and heir, each as the head of the House of Zähringen, since the death of the last reigning Grand Duke, Frederick II, in 1928.\n\n\n \n"}

LGBT persons face stigmatization among the broader population. According to the 2007 Pew Global Attitudes Project, 98 percent of Malian adults believe that homosexuality is a way of life that society should not accept, which was the highest rate of non-acceptance in the 45 countries surveyed.\n\nPrivate, adult, consensual and non-commercial homosexuality is legal in Mali.\n\nArticle 179 of the penal code punishes acts of \"public indecency\" with fines and imprisonment. This has sometimes been used against LGBT people who engage in public displays of affection.\n\nWhile technically legal, the prevailing cultural and religious beliefs of most Mali citizens view same-sex sexual activity and non-traditional gender roles as immoral.\n\nThere are no anti-discrimination laws to protect the LGBT community from harassment and abuse on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. also, societal discrimination is widespread.\n\nArticle 522 of the \"Code des Personnes et de la Famille\", which was passed by the National Assembly on 2 December 2011 and subsequently signed into the law by the president of Mali, forbids same-sex couples from adopting children.\n\nAccording to Dr. Dembelé Bintou Keita, the director of ARCAD/SIDA, an HIV/AIDS organization in Mali that provides health care for men who have sex with men (MSM), Malian society is not tolerant to MSM. They \"have no rights and certainly no right to claim their sexual orientation. All cultural beliefs towards MSM are negative.\" MSM are forced into bisexuality or underground sexual practices that put them at high risk of sexually transmitted and HIV infections. \"Men who are attracted to other men are forced to get married so that they will not bring shame to the family ... but they still have men as sexual partners.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of State's 2011 human rights report found that,\nThere were no publicly visible lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) organizations in the country.

{"id": "1799886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799886", "title": "Western conifer seed bug", "text": "Western conifer seed bug\n\nThe western conifer seed bug (\"Leptoglossus occidentalis\"), sometimes abbreviated as WCSB, is a species of true bug (Hemiptera) in the family Coreidae. It is native to North America west of the Rocky Mountains (California to British Columbia, east to Idaho and Nevada) but has in recent times expanded its range to eastern North America, to include Nova Scotia, Maine, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, and has become an accidental introduced species in parts of Europe.\n\nThis species is a member of the insect family Coreidae, or leaf-footed bugs, which also includes the similar \"Leptoglossus phyllopus\" and \"Acanthocephala femorata\", both known as the \"Florida leaf-footed bug\". Western conifer seed bugs are sometimes colloquially called stink bugs. While they do use a foul-smelling spray as a defense, they are not classified in the stink bug family Pentatomidae. In Chile, it has been confused with kissing bugs (Triatominae), causing unjustified alarm.\n\nThe average length is 16-20 millimeters, with males being smaller than females. They are able to fly, making a buzzing noise when airborne. Western conifer seed bugs are somewhat similar in appearance to the wheel bug (\"Arilus cristatus\") and other Reduviidae (assassin bugs). These, being Cimicomorpha, are not very closely related to leaf-footed bugs as Heteroptera go; though both have a proboscis, but only the assassin bugs bite even if unprovoked, and \"L. occidentalis\" like its closest relatives can be most easily recognized by the expanded hindleg tibiae and by the alternating light and dark bands which run along the outer wing edges on the flaring sides of the abdomen. Their primary defense is to spray a bitter, offending smell; however, if handled roughly they will stab with their proboscis, though they are hardly able to cause injury to humans as it is adapted only to suck plant sap and not, as in the assassin bugs, to inject poison.\n\nIn its native range, the Western Conifer Seed Bug feeds on the sap of developing conifer cones throughout its life, and its sap-sucking causes the developing seeds to wither and misdevelop. It is therefore considered a minor tree pest in North America, but becoming sometimes more harmful e.g. in conifer plantations. However, it is not monophagous and even adaptable enough to feed on angiosperms if it has to, though it seems to prefer resiniferous plants that are rich in terpenes. As these are produced by plants to deter herbivores, it might be that in evolving its ability to overcome these defenses, \"L. occidentalis\" actually became somewhat dependent on such compounds.\n\nIts host plants in the native range include conifers like the Lodgepole Pine (\"Pinus contorta\"), the White Spruce (\"P. glauca\"), and the Coast and Rocky Mountain Douglas-firs (\"Pseudotsuga menziesii\"). Outside the native range, it is also found on species like the Eastern White Pine (\"P. strobus\") and Red Pine (\"P. resinosa\") in eastern North America and Europe, and the Mountain Pine (\"P. mugo\"), European Black Pine (\"P. nigra\"), Scots Pine (\"P. sylvestris\") and Pistachio (\"Pistacia vera\") (pistaches or pistacio trees) in Europe.\n\nThe eggs are laid in small groups on the needles or leaf stems of its host plants, and hatch in spring. The nymphs go through 5 instar stages before moulting into adults. In the United States, the species is univoltine, but in southern Europe, it completes two generations a year, and in tropical Mexico even three. In the northern parts of its range, these bugs start to move about widely by September or so to seek crevices for overwintering; they may become a nuisance in areas with extensive conifer woods, as they will sometimes enter houses in considerable numbers. They have the potential to become structural pests, as it has been found that they will sometimes pierce PEX tubing with their mouthparts, resulting in leakage.\n\nThis insect is common in its native range along the temperate and warmer regions of the Pacific coast of North America and has steadily expanded eastwards. On its native continent, \"L. occidentalis\" has been located as far northeast as Nova Scotia.\n\nIn Europe, this species was first reported in 1999 from northern Italy; it had probably been accidentally imported with timber and, as it seems, more than once, as its presence was subsequently reported from that country almost simultaneously from locations a considerable distance apart. By 2007, it had established itself in the northern Balkans (Slovenia and Croatia), the Alps (Austria, Switzerland), and parts of the Czech Republic, France, Germany and Hungary; in 2003, it was found to occur in Spain, though this population probably derives from a separate introduction. The 2007 records from Weymouth College (England) and Oostende (Belgium) might also represent one or two further independent introductions. In late 2007, it was found at Wrocław and Miechów (Poland); these animals probably represent a further range expansion out of the Czech Republic. During the autumn of 2008, a large influx of this species arrived on the south coast of England, indicating natural immigration from continental Europe. In late 2009, a large group of western conifer seed bugs invaded Koç University in Istanbul, Turkey. The same thing happened in October 2012 in most of the cities of the French Alps, like Moûtiers. In 2017 it appears for the first time in the Southern Hemisphere, with several records from Chile.\n\nIt was also first recorded from Tokyo, Japan in 2008, and some additional records from Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefecture have been added until 2009.\n\n"}

Born in 1824, he matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 1 March 1848, and was entered a student of the Inner Temple in 1850.\n\nHe attracted the notice of Lord Palmerston at an early age, entered the diplomatic service at Palmerston's instigation, and was sent as an attaché to the embassy at Vienna on 14 July 1851. At the same time, Murray entered into an agreement with the \"Morning Post,\" by which he undertook to act as Vienna correspondent. Such a contravention of the usages of the foreign office was by an accident brought to the notice of the British ambassador, Lord Westmorland, by whom Murray, though protected against dismissal by the interest of Palmerston, was ostracised from the British chancery.\n\nOn 7 April 1852, he was temporarily transferred to Hanover, and on 19 October 1852, he was appointed fifth paid attaché at Constantinople, where his relations with Sir Stratford Canning were from the first the reverse of cordial, and resulted in his being banished as vice-consul to Mitylene.\n\nIn 1854, appeared his \"Roving Englishman\", a series of chapters on travel, in which the Turkish ambassador was satirised as \"Sir Hector Stubble\". Palmerston was unwilling to recall Murray, but in 1855 he was transferred to Odessa as consul-general.\n\nHe returned to England, after thirteen years of discord with the British residents in Odessa, in 1868, and contributed to the first numbers of \"Vanity Fair\". In the following year he started a weekly journal of the most mordant type, entitled \"The Queen's Messenger\", a prototype of the later \"Society papers\".\n\nOn 22 June 1869, Murray was horsewhipped by Lord Carrington at the door of the Conservative Club in St. James's Street, for a slander upon his father, Robert Carrington, 2nd Baron Carrington. The assault was made under strong provocation. Lord Carrington was prosecuted by Murray, and was found guilty at the Middlesex sessions on 22 July, but was only ordered to appear for judgment when called upon. Meanwhile, on 17 July, Murray had been charged at Bow Street with perjury in denying the authorship of the article in dispute. He was remanded on bail until the 29th, but before that date he withdrew to Paris, and practically exiled himself from Britain.\n\nHe became well known in the French capital as the \"Comte de Rethel d'Aragon\", taking the title of the Spanish lady whom he had married. He produced several novels, but was more at home in short satirical pieces, and wrote innumerable essays and sketches, caustic in matter and incisive in style, for the English and American press. He was Paris correspondent of the \"Daily News\" and the \"Pall Mall Gazette,\" was one of the early writers in the \"Cornhill Magazine\" and in the \"World,\" of which he was for a short time joint proprietor, and contributed character sketches to the \"Illustrated London News,\" and \"Queer Stories\" to \"Truth.\" He was certainly one of the most accomplished journalists of his day. He probably did more than any single person to initiate the modern type of journal, which is characterised by a tone of candour with regard to public affairs, but owes its chief attraction to the circulation of private gossip, largely by means of hint and innuendo.\n\nHe died at Passy on 20 December, and was buried in Paris on 24 December 1881.\n\nMurray's chief works were : \n\nAttribution:\n"}

Solomon is a longtime associate of the media watch group Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR). In 1997 he founded the Institute for Public Accuracy, which works to provide alternative sources for journalists, and serves as its executive director. Solomon's weekly column, \"Media Beat\", was in national syndication from 1992 to 2009. More recently Solomon focused on his 2012 congressional campaign in California's 2nd congressional district. He attended the 2016 Democratic National Convention as a Sanders delegate.\n\nSolomon came under FBI scrutiny after he picketed for the desegregation of a Maryland apartment complex at age 14. He drew further FBI surveillance for his efforts on behalf of the Montgomery County Student Alliance activist group both while a student and after dropping out of high school. He became aware of their surveillance later, through a Freedom of Information request. According to Solomon's autobiography, a book he titled \"Made Love, Got War\", he chose to drop out of high school near the end of his senior year of high school in Spring 1969.\n\nAfter high school, Solomon briefly attended Reed College in Oregon but left before graduating. In college, he began a lifelong commitment to peaceful protests against nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Solomon engaged in civil disobedience as part of the anti-nuclear movement, and eventually spent 40 days in jail as a result. He made eight trips to Moscow during the 1980s, including one during which he and a leader of an American group, the Alliance of Atomic Veterans, organized a sit-in at the U.S. Embassy, demanding that the U.S. join the Soviet Union in a halt to tests of nuclear bombs.\n\nAs a freelance reporter, Solomon worked for a number of years for Pacific News Service. In 1988, Solomon worked briefly as a spokesperson for the Alliance of Atomic Veterans in Washington, D.C.. He was hired in August 1988 to run the new Washington, D.C., office of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting.\n\nIn 1997, Solomon published \"The Trouble With Dilbert\", in which he charges that the popular comic strip \"Dilbert\" is a capitalist tool that promotes the evils of corporate America by pretending to satirize all the inhumane treatment, so employees will purchase Adams' works, thinking that they are supporting their own cause. \"Dilbert\" creator/author Scott Adams responded in his 1999 book \"The Joy of Work\", which included an imaginary interview between Solomon and Adams' canine character Dogbert. He remarked that Solomon was wrong as most workers in corporate America should simply go capitalist themselves.\n\nA book of Solomon's collected columns, \"The Habits of Highly Deceptive Media\", won the 1999 George Orwell Award for Distinguished Contribution to Honesty and Clarity in Public Language. Jonathan Kozol's introduction to the book noted \"the tradition of Upton Sinclair, Lincoln Steffens, and I. F. Stone does not get much attention these days in the mainstream press ... but that tradition is alive and well in this collection of courageously irreverent columns on the media by Norman Solomon...\"\n\nIn 2000, Solomon teamed up with Robert Parry to write a series of investigative reports on George W. Bush's Secretary of State Colin Powell, published on consortiumnews.com.\n\nSolomon's book \"Target Iraq: What the News Media Didn't Tell You\" (co-authored with Reese Erlich) was published in 2003 and translated into German, Italian, Hungarian, Portuguese, and Korean. \"War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\" appeared in 2005. The \"Los Angeles Times\" called the book \"a must-read for those who would like greater context with their bitter morning coffee, or to arm themselves for the debates about Iraq that are still to come.\" A based on the book was released in 2007.\n\nSolomon is the founder and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy, an organization founded in 1997 \"as a national consortium of independent public-policy researchers, analysts and activists.\" According to its web site, the mission of IPA is to increase \"the reach and capacity of progressive and grassroots organizations (at no cost to them) to address public policy by getting them and their ideas into the mainstream media\".\n\nOn April 13, 2011, Solomon officially announced his candidacy for the open House seat in the newly created 2nd congressional district of California. Representative Lynn Woolsey—the incumbent from the former 6th congressional district, which was geographically expanded into the new 2nd district via redistricting—announced her retirement later in June, setting up a competitive Democratic primary in one of the more liberal districts in the country.\n\nObservers expected Solomon to position himself to the left of his competitors and as the \"philosophical heir\" to Rep. Woolsey, a leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. In announcing his campaign Solomon himself argued, \"After so many years of progressive leadership from Lynn Woolsey, her successor in the House should have a proven commitment to a wide range of progressive values.\" Solomon emphasized his strong environmentalist background and particularly his opposition to nuclear power, which he used to differentiate himself from his primary opponent Assemblyman Jared Huffman.\n\nAs of late June 2011, Solomon had raised over $100,000 for his campaign. His overall fundraising strategy was patterned after those of Howard Dean and Barack Obama, as he sought to finance his campaign via small but continuous contributions from a large donor pool.\n\nSolomon failed to reach the general election, running third in the crowded primary, only 173 votes behind second place, with 14.9% of ballots cast, in the June 2012 California state elections. He followed eventual winner, Democratic state Assemblyman Jared Huffman (37.5%) and Republican Daniel Roberts with (15.0%). In California's newly implemented nonpartisan blanket primary, the top two vote recipients, regardless of party, proceed to compete in the general election.\n\nSolomon co-founded the online activist group RootsAction.org in early 2011; six years later, it counted more than 1.5 million active members. With Solomon as RootsAction's coordinator, the group has addressed a wide range of concerns. In 2012, it generated more than 14,000 individual emails to the government of Ecuador as part of a successful campaign urging asylum in Ecuador's London embassy for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\nIn August 2013, Solomon delivered a RootsAction petition with more than 100,000 signers to the Nobel Committee in Oslo, urging that then-Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. RootsAction was the first large U.S.-based online group to petition in support of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. In early 2014, RootsAction presented petitions (totaling 100,000 signers) to the State Department and Justice Department urging that the U.S. government restore Snowden's passport and end its efforts to capture him.\n\nOn June 4, 2014, Solomon was among the speakers at a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., announcing the launch of ExposeFacts.org as an ongoing project of the Institute for Public Accuracy. In tandem with IPA, RootsAction hosted a news conference in Washington on August 14, 2014, announcing a petition with more than 100,000 signatures in support of New York Times reporter James Risen. At issue was the U.S. government's attempt to force Risen to testify against an alleged source, former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling. C-SPAN aired the full 70-minute news conference, which was co-sponsored by the Institute for Public Accuracy and RootsAction.org.\n\nThe October 27, 2014 edition of The Nation published a cover story by Solomon and investigative journalist Marcy Wheeler on the intertwined cases of Risen and Sterling as well as overall Obama administration policies toward the news media and whistleblowers (\"The Government War Against Reporter James Risen\").\n\nSolomon was elected as a pledged Bernie Sanders delegate to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. As a resident of Marin County, he was elected to represent California's 2nd congressional district. He helped to organize, and was the coordinator of, the Bernie Delegates Network independent from the official Sanders campaign organization. Solomon said, \"As much as we love Bernie, we don't take orders from him.\" The network contacted 1,250 Sanders delegates, about two-thirds of the total. Sanders urged his delegates not to boo or engage in disruption on the convention floor. According to Solomon, a survey of the Sanders delegates showed that 28% felt no obligation to comply with Sanders' appeal.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is unclear if male and female same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Gabon. On July 5, 2019, a revised penal code was published that criminalizes “sexual relations between people of the same sex”. According to the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, published by the United States Department of State, this law to the penal code had yet to be applied by year's end. According to Davis Mac-Iyalla of the Interfaith Diversity Network of West Africa, he claims he knows of two men in Gabon who have already been arrested under the law and had to bribe the police to be let go.\n\nSame-sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples and LGBT persons face stigmatization among the broader population.\n\nIn December 2008, Gabon co-sponsored and signed the non-binding UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity calling for the global decriminalization of homosexuality, one of only six African countries to do so. In 2011, however, Gabon voted against joint statement on ending acts of violence and related human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity\" at the United Nations, condemning violence and discrimination against LGBT people.\n\nFollowing the country's independence from France in 1960, and up to 2019, same-sex relationships have not been criminalized. The age of consent, however, had always differed. Opposite-sex sexual acts required a minimum age of 18, while same-sex sexual act required the minimum age of 21. Despite this, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights reported in 2013 that Gabon continues a highly discriminatory environment for LGBT people, \"which may be why LGBT reporting of incidences is so low.\"\n\nOn July 5, 2019, Gabon enacted revisions to its Penal Code which criminalized homosexual relation between consenting adults with a potential penalty of imprisonment up to 6 months and/or a fine of up to 5 million CFA francs.\n\nThere is no legal recognition of same-sex couples.\n\nThere is no legal protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State's 2010 Human Rights Report found that \"discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons was a problem, and LGBT individuals often kept their status secret from the community for fear of being harassed or discriminated against\".\n\n"}

Same-sex sexual acts between men and between women are legal in Burkina Faso.\n\nBoth male and female same-sex sexual activity has always been legal in Burkina Faso. Age of consent is equal, regardless of sex since 1996.\n\nThe Constitution of Burkina Faso does not authorize same-sex marriage and defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman.\nLa famille est la cellule de base de la société. L’Etat lui doit protection. Le mariage est fondé sur le libre consentement de l’homme et de la femme.

Single applicants are almost never permitted to adopt children in Burkina Faso.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of State's 2011 Human Rights Report found that,\nThe law does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in employment and occupation, housing, statelessness, or access to education or health care. However, societal discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity remained a problem. Religious and traditional beliefs do not accept homosexuality, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons were reportedly occasional victims of verbal and physical abuse. There were no reports that the government responded to societal violence and discrimination against such persons. LGBT organizations had no legal presence in the country but existed unofficially. There were no reports of government or societal violence against such organizations.\nHIV/AIDS has a relatively low presence in Burkina Faso when compared to other African nations, with 0.80% of adults aged 15–49 infected by the virus. However, HIV remains a threat to the approximately 94,000 people infected as an estimated 65% of adult citizens living with HIV in Burkina Faso have access to antiretroviral drugs. Furthermore, only 28% of children aged 0–14 have access to antiretroviral drugs, a number that trails many African nations. Despite this, antiretroviral coverage has significantly improved in the country, as the estimated coverage for all ages was 32% in 2010.\n\n"}
{"id": "1799959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799959", "title": "Coalescent", "text": "Coalescent\n\nCoalescent is a science-fiction novel by Stephen Baxter. It is part one of the \"Destiny's Children\" series. The story is set in two main time periods: modern Britain, when George Poole finds that he has a previously unknown sister and follows a trail to a mysterious and ancient organisation in Rome (Puissant Order of Holy Mary Queen of Virgins); and the time of Regina, a girl growing up during the ending of Roman rule in Britain, around AD 400.\n\n\"Coalescent\" was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 2004.\n\nThe book consists of four distinct parts. The primary purpose of part one is the introduction of the characters, in ancient Britain and the present. Part two introduces a modern first-person view of the Order in Rome while following Regina's budding legacy centuries before. Part three hosts the clash and resolution of Poole and the Order's realities. Part four is a look eons into Humanity's Expansion into the Universe and provides a conclusion in George Poole's present.\n\nGeorge Poole copes with the mid-life crisis of losing his father. He meets Peter McLachlan, an eccentric member of an online free-thinking Internet group called the Slan(t)ers, who is researching dark matter and who is fascinated by a new and unknown artificial object discovered beyond the orbit of Pluto. George Poole uncovers an old picture showing a sister he never knew. Poole also discovers that his father regularly donated large sums of money to an organisation called the \"Puissant Order of Holy Mary Queen of Virgins\". Combined with a sense of futility in determining his future and encouragement from both Peter and his former wife Linda, Poole decides to uncover the mystery of his missing sister.\n\nPoole leaves England to visit his sister Gina (who is \"not\" his newly discovered missing sister) in Florida for information, despite their strained relationship. After spoiling his clever nephews as well as clashing with his distant sister Gina, Poole extracts the contact of a Jesuit priest in Rome and his own retired uncle in Florida. Poole learns from his uncle, Lou Casella, that his twin sister was given to the ancient Order when Poole's parents were unexpectedly landed with twins.\n\nBorn into a wealthy mosaic-designing family of 5th-century Roman Britain, seven-year-old Regina is uprooted from her comfortable villa due to her father's death and the Roman Empire's withdrawal. The Roman Empire loses its strength in Britain as invading Saxons pummel the Great Wall north of Roman settlements to where Regina and her grandfather Aetius relocated. Aetius dies after losing control over his unpaid mutinous soldiers.\n\nRegina seeks refuge with her servant Cartumandua's relatives in Verulamium but is betrayed by Carta's cousin Amator who rapes and abandons her. Verulamium burns down, forcing Regina and Cartumandua's family to live off the land in poverty for over sixteen years. Regina kills a roaming Saxon who nearly rapes her daughter, Brica. This event convinces Regina, the leader of their hamlet, to accept the invitation of warlord Artorius to help restore order to Britain again.\n\nIn modern Rome, Lucia, a fifteen-year-old scribe for the Order, is devastated when she begins to menstruate — unlike any of her friends and colleagues within the Order. Once this is discovered Lucia is initiated into in her new role within the Order. Meanwhile, Lucia falls in love with seventeen-year-old American Daniel Stannard but is snatched back into the Order to do what is expected of her. After being impregnated by an anonymous distant cousin in a ceremony held deep within the Order's chambers Lucia gives birth following only three months of pregnancy. The baby is removed from her at once and Lucia never sees her baby again. Emotionally unstable, she runs away with Daniel.\n\nBack in 5th Century Britain, Regina establishes her life working with Artorius, eventually managing his kingdom's record keeping. Artorius takes Regina as his wife for symbolic and moral reasons. She disdains Artorius' barbaric practices and thirst for conquest. Regina accompanies Artorius to a War Council where she realises to stay attached with the reckless Artorius would mean certain doom for her progeny. To search out her mother, Julia, Regina secures passage to Rome by allowing herself and her daughter to give sexual favours to a wealthy merchant named Ceawlin.\n\nUpon arriving in Rome, Regina contacts Amator, now openly homosexual and a wealthy bakery owner, and demands recompense for abandoning her and her family. Regina re-establishes contact with her mother, Julia, after a cool reunion. Regina joins the Puissant Order of Holy Mary Queen of Virgins, a Christian-adapted faction of the Vestal Virgins located on the Appian Way – an organisation that her family has become intimate with. Regina's leadership revives the ageing Order by converting it into a successful private school. Years later, on the night following her daughter's marriage, the Sack of Rome in 455 by the Vandals occurs. Regina's foresight saves the Order when the women and children are evacuated into the catacombs she had dug for a sanctuary.\n\nIn Regina's twilight years, she establishes important rules precedents for the Order. Unnecessary and unsupportable births are prohibited. A handful of mothers must dedicate their lives to replenishing the Order with births. Before her death in 476 AD, Regina establishes three main rules to govern the Order:\n\n\nIn the centuries following Regina's death, the Order assists the poor, robbed, and injured, gaining donations to its coffers from the occasional assisted person who became wealthy. Another Crypt that developed similarly to the Order is found and plans made for its eradication and occupation. In 1537, the Order survives the pillage of Rome during the Papacy of Clement VII by sacrificing five of its members to rape and death to divert Clement and his men's attention from an entrance to the Crypt.\n\nMeanwhile, in the present, George Poole, followed by a nervous Peter McLachlan, has a cool reunion with his lost sister Rosa. Rosa gives George a tour of the Crypt, the Order's secret human cache. Peter speculates with George about evidence of intelligent dark matter life moving through earth. Daniel serendipitously meets with George Poole, who is searching for additional information about the Order. Daniel, George Poole, and Peter take the very pregnant Lucia to a hospital where Peter becomes suspicious of the mysterious Order. The Order promptly retrieves Lucia from the hospital but not before Peter and George learn that most of the Crypt's inhabitants remain prepubescent indefinitely.\n\nGeorge Poole convinces his Jesuit priest contact to grant Peter access to ancient Catholic records. George's patriarchal roots are traced to a British surveyor named George Poole who came to Rome in 1863. George returns to the Crypt looking for information and finds himself smothered with the familiar smell and contact of those in the Crypt, all of whom share his similar facial features (namely, cloudy grey eyes). His sister Rosa almost persuades him to become assimilated into the Order as a stud but an urgent text message by Peter brings him to his senses.\n\nPeter has a theory explaining the strange peculiarities of the Order. The Order is a family of eusocial humans that evolved from the intense pressures to survive the various conquests of Rome over the centuries. He cites naked mole rats as an example of eusocial behaviour in mammals. He explains how Regina's three rules result in a \"genetic mandate for eusociality.\" He calls the Order a \"human hive\" and labels them \"Coalescents\" — a new kind of human. Peter then suddenly leaves after receiving a text message.\n\nDays later, George learns that Peter has invaded the Crypt and is threatening to set off Semtex plastic explosives to expose the Order. Peter and the Slan(t)ers are responsible for the recent bombing of a San Jose research facility investigating quantum gravity technology – under the belief that a higher intelligence would notice the manipulation of space-time and eradicate a possible threat to their superiority. Peter's reasoning in exposing the Crypt is that the Order does not exist for any purpose except for itself. It threatens to destroy humanity as individuals and replace it with mindless drones. Peter Mclachlan then detonates his bombs and dies. George begins the evacuation of the Crypt, and the mob of drones emerge hive-like from the crater in the middle of Via Cristoforo Colombo.\n\nToward the end of the novel there are also two short sections telling of a hive planet in the far future. A planet has been knocked out of its solar orbit, and the hives have survived deep underground for aeons. A military mission arrives, aiming to secure workers for the war-effort, and invades a colony. They fight their way into the hive, and ship the survivors off-world.\n\n"}

{"id": "1799970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799970", "title": "LGBT rights in Ghana", "text": "LGBT rights in Ghana\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Ghana face legal and societal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT citizens.\n\nSame-sex sexual acts are illegal in Ghana, and LGBT rights are heavily suppressed. The majority of Ghana's population hold anti-LGBT sentiments. Physical and violent homophobic attacks against LGBT people are common, and are often encouraged by the media and religious and political leaders. At times, government officials, such as police, engage in such acts of violence. Reports of young gay people being kicked out of their homes are also common, as well as reports of conversion therapy occurring across Ghana.\n\nDespite the Constitution guaranteeing a right to freedom of speech, expression and assembly to Ghanaian citizens, these fundamental rights are actively denied to LGBT people. Pro-LGBT activism exists in Ghana, but such efforts are often thwarted by the Ghanaian government.\n\nThere is historical evidence of homosexuality in Ghana. In the 18th and 19th century Asante courts, male slaves served as concubines. They dressed like women and were killed when their master died. In the Kingdom of Dahomey, eunuchs () were known as royal wives and played an important part at court.\n\nThe Nzema people had a tradition of adult men marrying each other, usually with a 10-year age difference. These marriage were called , \"friendship marriages\". The couple would obverse all the social equivalents of a heterosexual marriage, a bride price was paid and a traditional wedding ceremony was held. Among the Nankani, female marriages were observed for the continuous perpetuation of the lineage. Rose Mary Amenga-Etego states that these non-sexual woman to woman marriages were \"the last desperate religio-cultural practice employed to reclaim and reinstate the male genealogical descent structure of the people\".\n\nThe Fante people would believe that those, of either sex, with \"heavy souls\" were attracted to women, whereas those with \"light souls\" were attracted to men.\n\nHomosexuality in Ghana was criminalised in the 1860s. Thereafter, homophobia has become deeply ingrained.\n\nSection 104 of the Ghanaian Criminal Code of 1960 contains provisions criminalising consensual same-sex sexual acts between adults. Under Section 104(1)(b) \"unnatural carnal knowledge\" with consent is considered a misdemeanour. Under other subsections of Section 104, rape and bestiality are also criminalised. Additionally, Section 104(2) defines \"unnatural carnal knowledge\" as \"sexual intercourse with a person in an unnatural manner or with an animal.\" Under Article 296(4) of the Criminal Procedural Code, a misdemeanour shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years.\n\nSeveral sources indicate that whilst the law may not lead to prosecutions before local courts, numerous instances of persecution are widespread and common.\n\nIn 2013, a local lawyer, John Ndebugri challenged views on the illegality of lesbianism under Ghanaian law. According to him, lesbianism, which is also homosexuality, does not involve penetration with a penis and therefore cannot be described as sexual intercourse or unnatural, based on section 104 of the Criminal Code. He added: \"females don't have [sic] penis. They cannot penetrate,\" in a story published by MyJoyOnline.\n\nThe law also applies to straight people who have anal or oral sex. Though the state \"does not concern itself with this\" because it is their private life, causing allegations of hypocrisy.\n\nGhana does not recognise same-sex marriage or same-sex civil unions.\n\nA single person may apply to adopt a child if that person is a citizen of Ghana, except that a single male may adopt only if the child to be adopted is his biological child. Same-sex couples are not allowed to adopt children.\n\nSection 12(2) of Chapter 5 of the Constitution of Ghana provides that, \"Every person in Ghana, whatever his race, place of origin, political opinion, colour, religion, creed or gender shall be entitled to the fundamental human rights and freedoms of the individual contained in this Chapter but subject to respect for the rights and freedoms of others and for the public interest.\"\n\nAlthough there is no law against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, any person in Ghana who believes he/she has experienced discrimination on the basis of HIV status, gender identity or sexual orientation may report an incident through the Commission for Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) stigma and discrimination reporting portal.\n\nIn 2013, the United States offered to help Ghana develop legislation to protect the rights of LGBT persons.\n\nLGBT-identifying Ghanaians face discrimination around them in many facets of life and society. At the Accra International Airport, a sign states, \"Ghana does not welcome pedophiles and sexual deviants.\" While not explicitly referencing the LGBT community, Ghanaians associate sexual deviance with the LGBT community.\n\nAccording to a 19 August 2004 Afrol News report, Prince MacDonald‚ the leader of the organisation for gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transsexuals in Ghana, commented that \"there are lots and lots of people in our prison home who have been caught by this unfriendly law\". He said that the \"police beat and punish people who are found to be gays\".\n\nOn 21 July 2011, Paul Evans Aidoo, the Western Region Minister, ordered all gay people in the west of the country to be rounded up and arrested and called on landlords and tenants to inform on people they suspected of being gay. Statements made my public leaders and officials have impact, and are often followed with violent acts towards the LGBT community.\n\nPearl, a 30-year old lesbian woman from Ghana, shares that Ghanaians take action into their own hands when dealing with the LGBT community. Pearl shares that in September 2009, she was taken to a conference room in her village, amongst 50 other villagers. In this room, Pearl was repeatedly asked if she was lesbian, and when she stated that she was not, village members beat her. Amongst these villagers was a young boy who wanted to burn her alive.\n\nPearl's story is shared by other LGBT Ghanaians. It is viewed as shameful and as a disgrace for people to have family members that identify as LGBT. Emelia, a thirty-year-old woman, shared that when her father discovered that she was lesbian, he beat her with his fists and a broken beer bottle. Similarly, Agnes, a 26-year-old, shared that when her father discovered her sexuality, he chased her out of her house with a machete, and threatened to murder her if she returned. The type of violence LGBT-identifying peoples face in Ghana is found not only in community settings, but also in familiar settings, such as one's family.\n\nViolent mob attacks directed against LGBT people are common in Ghana. In 2012, a birthday party was violently interrupted by a mob, who claimed the party was a same-sex wedding. The police refused to arrest the attackers, and arrested some of the victims. In 2013, a gay man was subject to a manhunt, after Muslim officials threatened to burn or bury him alive because he was gay. In 2015, a group of lesbian women were \"shit-bombed\" and \"pelted with stones\" because they were gay.\n\nOn top of facing violence within their communities and homes, there are anti-gay vigilante groups that actively aim at discovering LGBT identifying peoples in their communities. A 10-person vigilante group had been monitoring a man, Ebenezer Okang, and one night visited his home to beat him, and with the intentions to burn him alive. When asked if he had reported the event, Okang shared that it is difficult to seek protection in such situations, given Ghana’s anti-LGBT laws and the police attitudes. According to Human Rights Watch, discrimination towards LGBT individuals is common in public and private, making it difficult for them to seek help.\n\nIn a rare incident in April 2017, police in Accra arrested two men who had blackmailed, extorted and abused a gay man, and who had threatened to post nude pictures of him. The police arrested the men and cooperated with the victim in finding them. \"Erasing 76 Crimes\", an LGBT website, labeled the arrest a \"rare exception\" as police seldom intervene to protect LGBT people from violence, discrimination and abuse.\n\nReports emerged in August 2018 of conversion therapy programmes run by religious leaders to \"cure\" LGBT people of their homosexuality. There is no reliable evidence that sexual orientation can be changed, and medical bodies warn that conversion therapy practices are ineffective and potentially harmful.\n\nGhana's police force has protected members of the LGBT community. For example, in the town of Tamale, they aided gay men who were being blackmailed.\n\nThere are also documented instances where the police have been the ones involved in violence against LGBT-identifying individuals. A woman reported that when her community discovered her sexuality, she was beaten by many community members, and was kicked in her mouth by a police officer.\n\nGiven that Ghana still has anti-gay laws in place, the police are legally required to go after LGBT citizens at times. In 2016, a lesbian couple, accused of having a wedding, was arrested by the police. In Ghana, being associated with LGBT acts warrants arrest and police action. Despite the laws in place, some LGBT groups, such as the Solace Initiative are providing LGBT citizens with human rights trained paralegals, so that when they face court, they can be aware of police violence or overreach of the law.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State's 2011 Human Rights Report found that,\nLGBT persons faced widespread discrimination [in 2010], as well as police harassment and extortion attempts. Gay men in prison were often subjected to sexual and other physical abuse. In June 2010[,] more than 1,000 protesters in Takoradi, Western Region, participated in a peaceful rally against reports of gay and lesbian activities in their city. This was reportedly the first such protest in the country. In May 2010[,] an HIV/AIDS training workshop was held in Takoradi for health- care workers. After the workshop, \"The Daily Graphic\" announced that 8,000 gay persons had been \"registered\" in the Western and Central Regions. However, experts in the field denied that there had been any such \"registration\". After the workshop[,] there was significant negative reporting in the media about homosexuality. In a June 2010 interview with \"The Daily Graphic\", the Western Region minister called on the government to take steps to combat homosexuality. He included the possibility of police raids on locales frequented by gay men and lesbians, efforts by community leaders to \"wean young people\" away from homosexuality, and a public condemnation by the government. However, no arrests of persons were made in connection with his comments by year's end, and he did not repeat his call. It was reported that four men who worked within the community of gay men were arrested in May 2010 in connection with an alleged sexual assault and were later charged with sodomy. The case was first brought to the Takoradi Circuit Court on 24 August; however, it had not been heard by year's end.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State's 2012 Human Rights Report found that,\nLGBT persons faced widespread discrimination, as well as police harassment and extortion attempts. Gay men in prison were often subjected to sexual and other physical abuse. In March a gang of men assaulted nine people they believed to be LGBT individuals in Jamestown, a neighborhood of Accra, forcing them from their homes and attacking them with canes and sticks. The victims filed a complaint with a legal human rights organization. They said their homes were burgled while they were chased out. No arrests had been made in the case by year's end. In May a peer educator employed by an NGO to instruct sexual health education workshops was assaulted by a group of boys at a school in the Volta Region. The assault occurred after they discovered he was carrying safe-sex presentation materials such as condoms, wooden sex organ replicas, lubricant, and pamphlets. The peer educator was detained by police but later released. The boys were not charged.The United Nations Rapporteur's 2018 Human Rights Report found that,While Ghana is meeting democracy and development goals, a quarter of the population lives in poverty with LGBT-identifying individuals being most subjected to this type of poverty. Given their sexual orientation, it is difficult for them to find jobs. Additionally, since many families disown their LGBT family members, this can leave them homeless. The rapporteur recommended that Ghana repeal its legislation on adult consensual same-sexual activities, and that the government launch a public campaign to educate on the rights and legal and social services of those who are victims of sexual discrimination.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Committee in October 2012 completed a Universal Periodic Review of the human rights situation in Ghana. The following recommendations were made to Ghana (the countries that initiated the recommendation are listed in brackets):\n\n\nGhana rejected all of these recommendations.\n\nAccording to a 2017 poll carried out by ILGA, 60% of Ghanaians agreed that gay, lesbian and bisexual people should enjoy the same rights as straight people, while 30% disagreed. Additionally, 59% agreed that they should be protected from workplace discrimination. 51% of Ghanaians, however, said that people who are in same-sex relationships should be charged as criminals, while 34% disagreed. As for transgender people, 64% agreed that they should have the same rights, 62% believed they should be protected from employment discrimination and 55% believed they should be allowed to change their legal gender.\n\nAccording to the Afro-barometer, Ghana places amongst the twenty least tolerable countries. When asked if they would care if they were neighbors to homosexual(s), only 11% of Ghana’s population reported that they would be fine with this. The continental average for African countries is 21%, so this places Ghana as nearly two times more intolerable towards homosexuals than the rest of the continent.\n\nWhen compared to other minority groups, such as people of a different ethnicity, different religion, foreign workers, or people infected with HIV/AIDS, Ghanaian citizens still reported having the most unfavorable feelings towards those who identify as a part of the LGBT community. With 89% of Ghanaians sharing that they strongly/somewhat dislike LGBT individuals, this makes them the most disliked group in the country of Ghana. Additionally, when examined as to who is being polled, all different demographics—those of a different age, education, religion, living style (rural or urban,) gender—reported having a dislike towards homosexuals of 80% or more. However, when individuals are more in contact with those of an LGBT identity, they are prone to be more tolerable.\n\nNearly 90% of Ghanaians shared that they would report a daughter, relative, friend, or co-worker to the police if they knew that they were engaging in such behavior. Additionally, 86% of Ghanaians stated they would support legislation to criminalize those who are in same-sex relationships.\n\nWhile serving as president of Ghana, the late John Evans Atta Mills vowed in 2011 not to legalise homosexuality despite UK Prime Minister David Cameron's threat to cut aid to Ghana because of its record on human rights for its gay population. In February 2017, Speaker of the Parliament Aaron Mike Oquaye called for amending the laws of Ghana to ban homosexuality entirely.\n\nIn November 2017, President Nana Akufo-Addo suggested that the legalisation of homosexuality in Ghana is inevitable and said he can foresee a change in the law. Akufo-Addo, who grew up in England, said that LGBT rights will evolve in Ghana as they have in the United Kingdom, but affirmed that LGBT rights were not part of the government agenda at the moment. In response, LGBT activists announced they would hold a peaceful march in Accra in December.\n\nIn August 2018, President Akufo-Addo stated that the Government of Ghana would not legalise same-sex marriage or decriminalise homosexuality.\n\nMany public officials from government and church organizations are publicly against the LGBT community. In March 2020, the National Women's Organizer of the National Democratic Congress shared that homosexuals should be killed. Many pastors speak out against the LGBT community, such as Kofi Tawiah, Head Pastor of the Osu Church of Christ, who called on Ghanian Christians to violently attack LGBT people. In his statement, Tawiah also stated that homosexuality should be treated with capital punishment.\n\nThe 2018 Human Rights Watch report noted that these types of comments made by government and public officials embolden homophobic acts of violence and discrimination towards the LGBT community.\n\nLGBT activism had largely been anonymous in Ghana. However, in the year 1998, a young man named Cobbina MacDarling who uses the pseudonym Prince Kweku MacDonald became one of its voices. Prince works with the Gay and Lesbian Association of Ghana (GALAG) which was later transformed into a human rights organization known as the Centre for Popular Education and Human Rights Ghana (CEPEHRG). In recent years, there have been several grassroot LGBT groups which have come together to form a bigger movement under the name Coalition Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia in Ghana. These groups operate underground. There are a few LGBT groups in Ghana, most of whom operate secretly online. One such group is FOTH-Ghana (Friends of the Heart - Ghana). Members of the group operate through the dark web. To be seen supporting the views and interest of gays, lesbians and bisexuals can easily result in the attack or probable lynching of its members.\n\nOne of the groups that is public in its advocacy efforts is the Gay and Lesbian Association of Ghana (GLAG). Some of their work involves demystifying issues with the HIV/AIDS crisis. Despite Ghana having a low infection rate, the government's public campaign efforts on this health crisis typically present it as an issue for straight individuals. Most gay men acknowledged that they understood that HIV can be transmitted sexually, but they were unaware that it can be transmitted through anal sex as well. Ghana receives funding to combat HIV/AIDS, but they discount the health risk presented for LGBT individuals. The Gay and Lesbian Association of Ghana, along with other LGBT advocacy groups, counteract the government's misinformation by specifically addressing it to the LGBT community, and by distributing and teaching of the usefulness of condoms and lube in preventing infection.\n\nAn issue with many activist groups is that their work is directly thwarted by the government. In September 2006, the BBC reported that the Ghanaian Government had banned an LGBT rights conference that was alleged to be taking place on September 4 at the Accra International Conference Centre. Minister of Information and National Origin Kwamena Bartels said, \"The government does not condone any such activity which violently offends the culture, morality[,] and heritage of the entire people of Ghana.\"\n\nIn March 2020, a historic conference was to be held in Accra. The Pan Africa ILGA was aiming to hold its first conference in West Africa to develop strategies to improve LGBT rights, increase awareness of LGBT issues, and to protect queer youth in Africa. After Ghana faced backlash from religious organizations, President Nana Akufo-Addo banned the event, citing that it would be considered illegal for such an event to be held in Ghana, since they legally condemn and criminalize same-sex acts amongst adults.\n\nLGBT advocacy efforts are often opposed and made illegal by the government, but anti-LGBT groups are embraced. In October 2019, The World Congress of Families, a US-based anti-LGBT group, held a conference in Accra. On the agenda for their conference, they planned to push the necessity of conversion therapy in Africa. These types of conferences are not the only types of anti-LGBT sentiments being shared and embraced in Ghana. It is also documented that vigilante groups go after the LGBT community in Ghana. Such groups spy, blackmail, and plan attacks on LGBT citizens, or those they suspect to be LGBT. Safety Empire is one of these vigilante groups, and in August 2015, they beat a young man they suspected to be gay in a town near the capital.\n\nOn an international front, many external entities, such as the United Nations and other individual countries, speak in favor of LGBT rights. Groups that are pro-LGBT rights view these international statements unfavorably, since they are often viewed as statements that do not support their advocacy or efforts, and only reignite the hate and discrimination towards LGBT individuals. An example of this is former President Atta Mills vowing to never legalize homosexuality when urged by the United Kingdom. This brought the issue of homosexuality back to a national front, but not in a favorable position.\n\n"}

It is a small double-pronged hair pin or clip that slides into hair with the prongs open and then the flexible prongs close over the hair to hold it in place. They are typically plain and unobtrusively colored, but some are elaborately decorated or jeweled. Bobby pins became popular in the 1920s to hold the new bobbed hairstyles.\n\nThe main use of a bobby pin is to hold hair in place. In addition to bobbed hair, bobby pins are often used in up-dos, buns, and other hair styles where a sleek look is desired. To use a bobby pin in hair hold the hair in the desired position and push the bobby pin (straight side up) into place.\n\nBobby pins can also be used to hold head coverings such as headbands, bandannas, and yarmulkes in place.\n\nThey can be used as decorative elements in hair.\n\nAttributes, such as the clipping action or having a readily available thin, flat piece of metal, mean the bobby pin can be used in other ways as well:\n\n\nLike barrettes, decorated bobby pins are sometimes meant to be noticed in hair. A decorated bobby pin can have beads, ribbons or other details on it, and is usually worn to pull back front sections of hair while looking decorative.\n\nBobby pins may also be tinted a hair colour, such as blonde, brown, or red to blend better into the hair.\n\nSome are made without the wavy rigid side and instead are smooth and curved. They are made this way to help with the grip factor and they stay closer and more tightly attached to the hair that it is pinned to.\n\nBobby pins may also be padded in order to avoid creasing the hair.\n\nEnglish manufacturers: Kirby, Beard & Co. Ltd. of Birmingham, pre-dates the invention of the “ Bobby pin”. The trademarked name \"Kirbigrip\" was just one of the pins produced by Kirby.\nThe bobby pin was invented by Luis Marcus, a San Francisco–based cosmetics manufacturer, after World War I and came into wide use as the hairstyle known as the \"bob cut\" or \"bobbed hair\" took hold. He originally sold two handmade bobby pins for 35 cents. Although Marcus thought about naming the pin after himself, he named them bobby after the bobbed hairstyle. A trademark on the term \"bobbie pin\" was held for some decades by Smith Victory Corporation of Buffalo, New York. A trademark infringement claim made by Smith Victory Corporation against Procter & Gamble regarding their naming their home permanent product Bobbi was settled in the 1950s by a payment to Smith Victory Corporation by P&G. The term is now in common usage and therefore is no longer a valid trademark.\n"}

It is a tributary of Lake Ilmen. It is long, and the area of its basin . The principal tributaries of the Msta are the Berezayka (left), the Uver (right), the Peretna (left), and the Kholova (left). The town of Borovichi and the urban-type settlement of Lyubytino are located on the banks of the Msta.\n\nThe source of the Msta is in Lake Mstino in the Valdai Hills immediately north of the town of Vyshny Volochyok. The river flows north, accepts the Berezayka from the left, and enters Novgorod Oblast. There, it accepts the Uver from the right and turns northwest. Downstream from the town of Borovichi, it forms the border between Borovichsky and Okulovsky District, and still downstream between Okulovsky and Lyubytinsky District. It departs from the border to the north, and downstream of the settlement of Lyubytino sharply turns southwest. It makes one more curve at the border with Krestetsky District and has its mouth downstream of the settlement of Proletariy.\n\nThe river basin of the Msta is vast and comprises the eastern part of Novgorod Oblast and the areas in the northern part of Tver Oblast. The towns of Borovichi, Bologoye, Udomlya, Okulovka, and Valday lie in the river basin of the Msta.\n\nUp to mid-19th century, Msta, which belongs to the river basin of the Neva, had been a part of an important water trade route connecting the Baltic and Caspian seas due to the very short distance between the Tsna, then the tributary of Lake Mstino, and the Tvertsa, a left tributary of the Volga. The portage between these lakes existed from the Middle Ages. In the beginning of the 18th century, Vyshny Volochyok Waterway was constructed, connecting the Msta and the Tvertsa. By the middle of the 19th century, after opening of the Volga-Baltic Waterway and the Moscow-Saint Petersburg Railway, the significance of the Msta as a transport route has decreased.\n\nIt is also notable for the rapids in a section between Opechensky Posad and Borovichi, and is a popular rafting route.\n\nThe lowest of the Msta, downstream of the selo of Mstinsky Most, are listed as navigable in the State Water Register of Russia.\n"}

{"id": "1799997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799997", "title": "Mutualism (economic theory)", "text": "Mutualism (economic theory)\n\nMutualism is an anarchist school of thought and economic theory that advocates a socialist society based on free markets and usufructs, i.e. occupation and use property norms. One implementation of this system involves the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration. Mutualism is based on a version of the labor theory of value which it uses as its basis for determining economic value. According to mutualist theory, when a worker sells the product of their labor, they ought to receive money, goods, or services in exchange that are equal in economic value, embodying \"the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility\".\n\nMutualism was popularized by the writings of anarchist philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Mutualists are opposed to individuals receiving income through loans, investments and rent under capitalist social relations. Although personally opposed to this type of income, Proudhon expressed that he had never intended \"to forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I think that all these manifestations of human activity should remain free and voluntary for all: I ask for them no modifications, restrictions or suppressions, other than those which result naturally and of necessity from the universalization of the principle of reciprocity which I propose\". As long as they ensure the worker's right to the full product of their labor, mutualists support markets and property in the product of labor, differentiating between capitalist private property (productive property) and personal property (private property). Mutualists argue for conditional titles to land, whose ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called possession), a type of private property with strong abandonment criteria. This contrasts with capitalist non-proviso Lockean sticky property, where owners maintain a property title more or less until they consent to gift or sell it.\n\nAs libertarian socialists, mutualists distinguish their market socialism from state socialism and do not advocate state control over the means of production. Instead, each person possesses a means of production, either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market. Benjamin Tucker wrote of Proudhon that \"though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, he aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few [...] by subjecting capital to the natural law of competition, thus bringing the price of its own use down to cost\".\n\nAlthough similar to the economic doctrines of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists, mutualism is in favor of large industries. Mutualism has been retrospectively characterized sometimes as being a form of individualist anarchism and as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism as well. Proudhon himself described the liberty he pursued as \"the synthesis of communism and property\". As a result, some consider mutualism to be part of free-market anarchism, individualist anarchism and market-oriented left-libertarianism while others regard it to be part of social anarchism.\n\nAs a term, mutualism has seen a variety of related uses. Charles Fourier first used the French term \"mutualisme\" in 1822, although the reference was not to an economic system. The first use of the noun mutualist was in the \"New-Harmony Gazette\" by an American Owenite in 1826. In the early 1830s, a French labor organization in Lyons called themselves the Mutuellists.\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon was involved with the Lyons mutualists and later adopted the name to describe his own teachings. In \"What Is Mutualism?\", Clarence Lee Swartz gives his own account of the origin of the term, claiming that \"[t]he word \"mutualism\" seems to have been first used by John Gray, an English writer, in 1832\". When Gray's 1825 \"Lecture on Human Happiness\" was first published in the United States in 1826, the publishers appended the \"Preamble and Constitution of the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests, Located at Valley Forge\". 1826 also saw the publication of the \"Constitution of the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests at Kendal, Ohio\".\n\nBy 1846, Proudhon was speaking of \"mutualité\" in his writings and he used the term \"mutuellisme\" at least as early as 1848 in his \"Programme Révolutionnaire\". In 1850, William Batchelder Greene used the term mutualism to describe a mutual credit system similar to that of Proudhon. In 1850, the American newspaper \"The Spirit of the Age\", edited by William Henry Channing, published proposals for a mutualist township by Joshua King Ingalls and Albert Brisbane, together with works by Proudhon, Greene, Pierre Leroux and others.\n\nProudhon ran for the French Constituent Assembly in April 1848, but was not elected, although his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besançon and Lille. He was successful in the complementary elections of June 4 and served as a deputy during the debates over the National Workshops, created by the 25 February 1848 decree passed by Republican Louis Blanc. The workshops were to give work to the unemployed. Proudhon was never enthusiastic about such workshops, perceiving them to be essentially charitable institutions that did not resolve the problems of the economic system. He was against their elimination unless an alternative could be found for the workers who relied on the workshops for subsistence.\n\nProudhon was surprised by the French Revolution of 1848. He participated in the February uprising and the composition of what he termed \"the first republican proclamation\" of the new republic. However, he had misgivings about the new provisional government headed by Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure (1767–1855), who since the French Revolution in 1789 had been a longstanding politician, although often in the opposition. Proudhon published his own perspective for reform which was completed in 1849, \"Solution du problème social\" (\"Solution of the Social Problem\"), in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from capitalists and financiers to workers. The central part of his plan was the establishment of a bank to provide credit at a very low rate of interest and the issuing of exchange notes that would circulate instead of money based on gold.\n\nMutualism has been associated with two types of currency reform. Labor notes were first discussed in Owenite circles and received their first practical test in 1827 in the Time Store of former New Harmony member and individualist anarchist Josiah Warren. Mutual banking aimed at the monetization of all forms of wealth and the extension of free credit. It is most closely associated with William Batchelder Greene, but Greene drew from the work of Proudhon, Edward Kellogg and William Beck as well as from the land bank tradition.\nMutualism can in many ways be considered the original anarchy since Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was the first to identify himself as an anarchist. Although mutualism is generally associated with anarchism, it is not necessarily anarchist. Historian Wendy McElroy reports that American individualist anarchism received an important influence of three European thinkers. One of the most important of these influences was the French political philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, whose words \"Liberty is not the Daughter But the Mother of Order\" appeared as a motto on \"Liberty\"s masthead. \"Liberty\" was an influential American individualist anarchist publication of Benjamin Tucker. For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, \"[i]t is apparent [...] that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews. [...] William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form\".\n\nAfter 1850, Greene became active in labor reform. He was elected vice-president of the New England Labor Reform League, the majority of the members holding to Proudhon's scheme of mutual banking; and in 1869 president of the Massachusetts Labor Union. He then publishes \"Socialistic, Mutualistic, and Financial Fragments\" (1875). He saw mutualism as the synthesis of \"liberty and order\". His \"associationism [...] is checked by individualism. [...] \"Mind your own business\", \"Judge not that ye be not judged\". Over matters which are purely personal, as for example, moral conduct, the individual is sovereign as well as over that which he himself produces. For this reason, he demands \"mutuality\" in marriage—the equal right of a woman to her own personal freedom and property\".\n\nTucker later connected his economic views with those of Proudhon, Warren and Karl Marx, taking sides with the first two while also arguing against American anti-socialists who declared socialism as imported, stating: \n\nMutualist ideas found fertile ground in the 19th century in Spain. In Spain, Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal \"El Porvenir\" in A Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon's ideas. The Catalan politician Francesc Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party. According to George Woodcock, \"[t]hese translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's\".\n\nAccording to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\": \"During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralized, or cantonalist, political system on Proudhonian lines\". Pi i Margall was a dedicated theorist in his own right, especially through book-length works such as \"La reacción y la revolución\" (\"Reaction and Revolution\" from 1855), \"Las nacionalidades\" (\"Nationalities\" from 1877) and \"La Federación\" (\"The Federation\" from 1880). For prominent anarcho-syndicalist Rudolf Rocker, \"[t]he first movement of the Spanish workers was strongly influenced by the ideas of Pi y Margall, leader of the Spanish Federalists and disciple of Proudhon. Pi y Margall was one of the outstanding theorists of his time and had a powerful influence on the development of libertarian ideas in Spain. His political ideas had much in common with those of Richard Price, Joseph Priestly [\"sic\"], Thomas Paine, Jefferson, and other representatives of the Anglo-American liberalism of the first period. He wanted to limit the power of the state to a minimum and gradually replace it by a Socialist economic order\".\n\nAccording to historian of the First International G. M. Stekloff, in April 1856 \"arrived from Paris a deputation of Proudhonist workers whose aim it was to bring about the foundation of a Universal League of Workers. The object of the League was the social emancipation of the working class, which, it was held, could only be achieved by a union of the workers of all lands against international capital. Since the deputation was one of Proudhonists, of course this emancipation was to be secured, not by political methods, but purely by economic means, through the foundation of productive and distributive co-operatives\". Stekloff continues by saying that \"[i]t was in the 1863 elections that for the first time workers' candidates were run in opposition to bourgeois republicans, but they secured very few votes. [...] [A] group of working-class Proudhonists (among whom were Murat and Tolain, who were subsequently to participate in the founding of the (First) International issued the famous Manifesto of the Sixty, which, though extremely moderate in tone, marked a turning point in the history of the French movement. For years and years the bourgeois liberals had been insisting that the revolution of 1789 had abolished class distinctions. The Manifesto of the Sixty loudly proclaimed that classes still existed. These classes were the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The latter had its specific class interests, which none but workers could be trusted to defend. The inference drawn by the Manifesto was that there must be independent working-class candidates\".\n\nFor Stekloff, \"the Proudhonists, who were at that date the leaders of the French section of the International. They looked upon the International Workingmen's Association as a sort of academy or synagogue, where Talmudists or similar experts could \"investigate\" the workers' problem; wherein the spirit of Proudhon they could excogitate means for an accurate solution of the problem, without being disturbed by the stresses of a political campaign. Thus Fribourg, voicing the opinions of the Parisian group of the Proudhonists (Tolain and Co.) assured his readers that \"the International was the greatest attempt ever made in modern times to aid the proletariat towards the conquest, by peaceful, constitutional, and moral methods, of the place which rightly belongs to the workers in the sunshine of civilisation\". According to Stekoff, the Belgian Federation \"threw in its lot with the anarchist International at its Brussels Congress, held in December, 1872. [...] [T]hose taking part in the socialist movement of the Belgian intelligentsia were inspired by Proudhonist ideas which naturally led them to oppose the Marxist outlook\".\n\nMutualism also had a considerable influence in the Paris Commune. George Woodcock manifests that \"a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the libertarian collectivists Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and Elisée Reclus and Louise Michel\".\n\n19th-century mutualists considered themselves libertarian socialists and are still considered libertarian socialists to this day. While oriented towards cooperation, mutualists favor free market solutions, believing that most inequalities are the result of preferential conditions created by government intervention. Mutualism is something of a middle way between classical economics and socialism of the collectivist variety, with some characteristics of both. As for capital goods (man-made, non-land means of production), mutualist opinions differs on whether these should be commonly managed public assets or private property. Contemporary mutualist Kevin Carson considers mutualism to be free-market socialism. Proudhon supported labor-owned cooperative firms and associations, for \"we need not hesitate, for we have no choice. [...] [I]t is necessary to form an association among workers [...] because without that, they would remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two [...] castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society\" and so \"it becomes necessary for the workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism\". In the preface to his \"Studies in Mutualist Political Economy\", Carson describes this work as \"an attempt to revive individualist anarchist political economy, to incorporate the useful developments of the last hundred years, and to make it relevant to the problems of the twenty-first century\".\n\nContemporary mutualists are among those involved in the Alliance of the Libertarian Left and in the Voluntary Cooperation Movement. Contemporary mutualist Kevin Carson holds that capitalism has been founded on \"an act of robbery as massive as feudalism\" and argues that capitalism could not exist in the absence of a state. He says that \"[i]t is state intervention that distinguishes capitalism from the free market\". Carson does not define capitalism in the idealized sense, but he says that when he talks about capitalism he is referring to what he calls actually existing capitalism. He believes the term \"laissez-faire\" capitalism is an oxymoron because capitalism, he argues, is \"organization of society, incorporating elements of tax, usury, landlordism, and tariff, which thus denies the Free Market while pretending to exemplify it\". However, he says he has no quarrel with anarcho-capitalists who use the term \"laissez-faire\" capitalism and distinguish it from actually existing capitalism. Carson says he has deliberately chosen to resurrect an old definition of the term. However, many anarchists, including mutualists, continue to use the term and do not consider it an old definition of the term.\n\nCarson argues that the centralization of wealth into a class hierarchy is due to state intervention to protect the ruling class by using a money monopoly, granting patents and subsidies to corporations, imposing discriminatory taxation and intervening militarily to gain access to international markets. Carson's thesis is that an authentic free-market economy would not be capitalism as the separation of labor from ownership and the subordination of labor to capital would be impossible, bringing a classless society where people could easily choose between working as a freelancer, working for a fair wage, taking part of a cooperative, or being an entrepreneur. As did Benjamin Tucker before him, he notes that a mutualist free-market system would involve significantly different property rights than capitalism is based on, particularly in terms of land and intellectual property.\n\nThe primary aspects of mutualism are free association, reciprocity and gradualism, or dual power. Mutualism is often described by its proponents as advocating an anti-capitalist free market. Mutualists argue that most of the economic problems associated with capitalism each amount to a violation of the cost principle, or as Josiah Warren interchangeably said, the cost the limit of price. It was inspired by the labor theory of value which was popularized—although not invented—by Adam Smith in 1776 (Proudhon mentioned Smith as an inspiration). The labor theory of value holds that the actual price of a thing (or the true cost) is the amount of labor that was undertaken to produce it. In Warren's terms, cost should be the limit of price, with cost referring to the amount of labor required to produce a good or service. Anyone who sells goods should charge no more than the cost to himself of acquiring these goods.\n\nMutualism holds that producers should exchange their goods at cost-value using systems of contract. While Proudhon's early definitions of cost-value were based on fixed assumptions about the value of labor-hours, he later redefined cost-value to include other factors such as the intensity of labor, the nature of the work involved and so on. He also expanded his notions of contract into expanded notions of federation. As Proudhon argued: \n\nDual power is the process of building alternative institutions to the ones that already exist in modern society. Originally theorized by Proudhon, it has become adopted by many anti-state movements like autonomism and agorism. Proudhon described it as such: Beneath the governmental machinery, in the shadow of political institutions, out of the sight of statemen and priests, society is producing its own organism, slowly and silently; and constructing a new order, the expression of its vitality and autonomy.\n\nDual power should not be confused with the dual power popularized by Vladimir Lenin as it was also theorized by Proudhon and it refers to a more specific scenario where a revolutionary entity intentionally maintains the structure of the previous political institutions until the power of the previous institution is weakened enough such that the revolutionary entity can overtake it entirely. Dual power as implemented by mutualists and agorists is the development of the alternative institution itself.\n\nMutualists argue that association is only necessary where there is an organic combination of forces. For instance, an operation that requires specialization and many different workers performing their individual tasks to complete a unified product, i.e. a factory. In this situation, workers are inherently dependent on each other—and without association they are related as subordinate and superior, master and wage-slave.\n\nAn operation that can be performed by an individual without the help of specialized workers does not require association. Proudhon argued that peasants do not require societal form and only feigned association for the purposes of solidarity in abolishing rents, buying clubs and so on. He recognized that their work is inherently sovereign and free. In commenting on the degree of association that is preferable, Proudhon said: In cases in which production requires great division of labour, it is necessary to form an association among the workers [...] because without that they would remain isolated as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two industrial castes of masters and wage workers, which is repugnant in a free and democratic society. But where the product can be obtained by the action of an individual or a family, [...] there is no opportunity for association.\n\nFor Proudhon, mutualism involved creating industrial democracy, a system where workplaces would be \"handed over to democratically organised workers' associations. [...] We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies woven into the common cloth of the democratic social Republic\". He urged \"workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism\". This would result in \"[c]apitalistic and proprietary exploitation, stopped everywhere, the wage system abolished, equal and just exchange guaranteed\". Workers would no longer sell their labour to a capitalist but rather work for themselves in co-operatives.\n\nAs Robert Graham notes: \"Proudhon's market socialism is indissolubly linked to his notions of industrial democracy and workers' self-management\". K. Steven Vincent notes in his in-depth analysis of this aspect of Proudhon's ideas that \"Proudhon consistently advanced a program of industrial democracy which would return control and direction of the economy to the workers\". For Proudhon, \"strong workers' associations [...] would enable the workers to determine jointly by election how the enterprise was to be directed and operated on a day-to-day basis\".\n\nMutualists argue that free banking should be taken back by the people to establish systems of free credit. They contend that banks have a monopoly on credit, just as capitalists have a monopoly on the means of production and landlords have a monopoly on land. Banks are essentially creating money by lending out deposits that do not actually belong to them, then charging interest on the difference. Mutualists argue that by establishing a democratically run mutual bank or credit union, it would be possible to issue free credit so that money could be created for the benefit of the participants rather than for the benefit of the bankers. Individualist anarchists noted for their detailed views on mutualist banking include Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, William Batchelder Greene and Lysander Spooner. Some modern forms of mutual credit are LETS and the Ripple monetary system project.\n\nIn a session of the French legislature, Proudhon proposed a government-imposed income tax to fund his mutual banking scheme, with some tax brackets reaching as high as 33 percent and 50 percent, but it was turned down by the legislature. This income tax Proudhon proposed to fund his bank was to be levied on rents, interest, debts and salaries. Specifically, Proudhon's proposed law would have required all capitalists and stockholders to disburse one-sixth of their income to their tenants and debtors and another sixth to the national treasury to fund the bank.\n\nThis scheme was vehemently objected to by others in the legislature, including Frédéric Bastiat. The reason given for the income tax's rejection was that it would result in economic ruin and that it violated \"the right of property\". In his debates with Bastiat, Proudhon did once propose funding a national bank with a voluntary tax of 1%. Proudhon also argued for the abolition of all taxes.\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon was one of the most famous philosophers who articulated thoughts on the nature of property. He is known for claiming that \"property is theft\", but is less known for the claims that \"property is liberty\" and \"property is impossible\". According to Colin Ward, Proudhon did not see a contradiction between these slogans. This was because Proudhon distinguished between what he considered to be two distinct forms of property often bound up in the single label. To the mutualist, this is the distinction between property created by coercion and property created by labor. Property is theft \"when it is related to a landowner or capitalist whose ownership is derived from conquest or exploitation and [is] only maintained through the state, property laws, police, and an army\". Property is freedom for \"the peasant or artisan family [who have] a natural right to a home, land [they may] cultivate, [...] to tools of a trade\" and the fruits of that cultivation—but not to ownership or control of the lands and lives of others. The former is considered illegitimate property, the latter legitimate property. Proudhon argued that property in the product of labor is essential to liberty while property that strayed from possession (\"occupancy and use\") was the basis for tyranny and would lead a society to destroy itself. The conception of entitlement property as a destructive force and illegitimate institution can be seen in this quote by Proudhon: Then if we are associated for the sake of liberty, equality, and security, we are not associated for the sake of property; then if property is a natural right, this natural right is not social, but anti-social. Property and society are utterly irreconcilable institutions. It is as impossible to associate two proprietors as to join two magnets by their opposite poles. Either society must perish, or it must destroy property. If property is a natural, absolute, imprescriptible, and inalienable right, why, in all ages, has there been so much speculation as to its origin? – for this is one of its distinguishing characteristics. The origin of a natural right! Good God! who ever inquired into the origin of the rights of liberty, security, or equality?\n\nIn \"What Is Mutualism?\", Clarence Lee Swartz says: It is, therefore, one of the purposes of Mutualists, not only to awaken in the people the appreciation of and desire for freedom, but also to arouse in them a determination to abolish the legal restrictions now placed upon non-invasive human activities and to institute, through purely voluntary associations, such measures as will liberate all of us from the exactions of privilege and the power of concentrated capital.\n\nSwartz also states that mutualism differs from anarcho-communism and other collectivist philosophies by its support of private property, arguing: \"One of the tests of any reform movement with regard to personal liberty is this: Will the movement prohibit or abolish private property? If it does, it is an enemy of liberty. For one of the most important criteria of freedom is the right to private property in the products of ones labor. State Socialists, Communists, Syndicalists and Communist-Anarchists deny private property\". However, Proudhon warned that a society with private property would lead to statist relations between people, arguing: The purchaser draws boundaries, fences himself in, and says, 'This is mine; each one by himself, each one for himself.' Here, then, is a piece of land upon which, henceforth, no one has right to step, save the proprietor and his friends; which can benefit nobody, save the proprietor and his servants. Let these multiply, and soon the people [...] will have nowhere to rest, no place of shelter, no ground to till. They will die of hunger at the proprietor's door, on the edge of that property which was their birth-right; and the proprietor, watching them die, will exclaim, 'So perish idlers and vagrants.'\n\nUnlike capitalist private-property supporters, Proudhon stressed equality. He thought that all workers should own property and have access to capital, stressing that in every cooperative \"every worker employed in the association [must have] an undivided share in the property of the company\". This distinction Proudhon made between different kinds of property has been articulated by some later anarchist and socialist theorists as one of the first distinctions between private property and personal property, with the latter having direct use-value to the individual possessing it.\n\nMutualists believe that land should not be a commodity to be bought and sold, advocating for conditional titles to land based on occupancy and use norms. Mutualists argue about whether an individual has a legitimate claim to ownership of land if he is not currently using it but has already incorporated his labor into it. All mutualists agree that everything which is produced by human labor and machines can be owned as personal property. Mutualists reject the idea of non-personal property and non-proviso Lockean sticky property. Any property that is obtained through the use of violence, bought with money that was gained through exploitation, or bought with money that was gained violating usufruct property norms is considered illegitimate.\n\nAccording to mutualist theory, the main problem with capitalism is that it allows for non-personal property ownership. Under these conditions, a person can buy property that they do not physically use themselves with the only goal of owning said property in order to prevent others from using it, putting them in an economically weak position, vulnerable enough to be controlled and exploited. Mutualists argue that this is historically how certain people were able to become capitalists. According to mutualism, a capitalist is someone who makes money by exercising power rather than laboring. Over time, under these conditions there emerged a minority class of individuals who owned all the means of production as non-personal property (the capitalist class) and a large class of individuals with no access to the means of production (the laboring class). The laboring class does not have direct access to the means of production and therefore is forced to sell the only thing they can in order to survive, i.e. their labor power, giving up their freedom to someone who the owns means of production in exchange for a wage. The wage a worker receives is always less than the value of the goods and services he produces. If an employer pays a laborer equal to the value of the goods and services that he produced, then the capitalist would at most break even. In reality, the capitalist pays his worker less and after subtracting overhead, the remaining difference is exploited profit which the capitalist has gained without working. Mutualists point out that the money capitalists use to buy new means of production is the surplus value that they exploited from laborers.\n\nMutualists also argue that capitalists maintain ownership of their non-personal properties because they support state violence through the funding of election campaigns. The state protects capitalist non-personal property ownership against direct occupation and use by the public in exchange for money and election support. Capitalists are then able to continue buying labor-power and the means of production as non-personal property and are able to continue extracting more surplus-value from more laborers, continuing the cycle. Mutualist theory states that by establishing usufruct property norms, exclusive non-personal ownership of the means of production by the capitalist class would be eliminated. The laboring classes would then have direct access to means of production, enabling them to work and produce freely in worker owned enterprises while retaining the full value of whatever they sell. Wage labor would be eliminated and it would be impossible to become a capitalist because the widespread labor market would no longer exist and no one would be able to own the means of production in the form of non-personal property, two ingredients which are necessary for the exploitation of labor. This would result in the capitalist class to labor along with the rest of society.\n\nIn Europe, a contemporary critic of Proudhon was the early libertarian communist Joseph Déjacque, who was able to serialise his book \"L'Humanisphère, Utopie anarchique\" (\"The Humanisphere: Anarchic Utopia\") in his periodical \"Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social\" (\"Libertarian: Journal of Social Movement\"), published in 27 issues from 9 June 1858 to 4 February 1861 while living in New York. Unlike and against Proudhon, he argued that \"it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature\". In his critique of Proudhon, Déjacque also coined the word libertarian and argued that Proudhon was merely a liberal, a moderate, suggesting him to become \"frankly and completely an anarchist\" instead by giving up all forms of authority and property. Since then, the word libertarian has been used to describe this consistent anarchism which rejected private and public hierarchies along with property in the products of labour as well as the means of production. Libertarianism is frequently used as a synonym for anarchism and libertarian socialism.\n\nOne area of disagreement between anarcho-communists and mutualists stems from Proudhon's alleged advocacy of labour vouchers to compensate individuals for their labor as well as markets or artificial markets for goods and services. Peter Kropotkin, like other anarcho-communists, advocated the abolition of labor remuneration and questioned \"how can this new form of wages, the labor note, be sanctioned by those who admit that houses, fields, mills are no longer private property, that they belong to the commune or the nation?\". According to George Woodcock, Kropotkin believed that a wage system in any form, whether \"administered by Banks of the People or by workers' associations through labor cheques\", is a form of compulsion.\n\nCollectivist anarchist Mikhail Bakunin was an adamant critic of Proudhonian mutualism as well, stating: \"How ridiculous are the ideas of the individualists of the Jean Jacques Rousseau school and of the Proudhonian mutualists who conceive society as the result of the free contract of individuals absolutely independent of one another and entering into mutual relations only because of the convention drawn up among men. As if these men had dropped from the skies, bringing with them speech, will, original thought, and as if they were alien to anything of the earth, that is, anything having social origin\".\n\nCriticism from pro-capitalist market sectors has been common as well. Some critics object to the use of the term \"capitalism\" in reference to historical or actually existing economic arrangements which they term \"mixed economies\". They reserve the term for the abstract ideal or future possibility of a genuinely free market which may closely follow contemporary mutualist Kevin Carson's free-market anti-capitalism in its practical details, except for the fact that Carson does not recognize a right of an individual to protect land that he has transformed through labor or purchased to be protected when he is not using it. Like other mutualists, Carson only recognize occupancy and use as the standard for retaining legitimate control over something. As a result of mutualist views on property, Austrian School economist and Objectivist George Reisman charges that mutualism supports exploitation when it does not recognize a right of an individual to protect land that he has mixed his labor with if he happens to not be using it. Reisman sees the seizure of such land as the theft of the product of labor and has argued: \"Mutualism claims to oppose the exploitation of labor, i.e. the theft of any part of its product. But when it comes to labor that has been mixed with land, it turns a blind eye out foursquare on the side of the exploiter\".\n\nThe pro-capitalism criticism is due to the different conception of property rights between capitalism and mutualism, with the latter supporting free access to capital, the means of production and natural resources, arguing that permanent private ownership of land and capital entails to monopolization, if there is not the equal liberty of access; and that a society with capitalist private property inevitably lead to statist relations between people. For mutualists, occupancy and use is \"the only legitimate standard for establishing ownership of land, regardless of how many times it has changed hands\". According to Carson, \"[a]n existing owner may transfer ownership by sale or gift; but the new owner may establish legitimate title to the land only by his own occupancy and use. A change in occupancy will amount to a change in ownership. Absentee landlord rent, and exclusion of homesteaders from vacant land by an absentee landlord, are both considered illegitimate by mutualists. The actual occupant is considered the owner of a tract of land, and any attempt to collect rent by a self-styled landlord is regarded as a violent invasion of the possessor's absolute right of property\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1800005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800005", "title": "The Android Invasion", "text": "The Android Invasion\n\nThe Android Invasion is the fourth serial of the thirteenth season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast on BBC1 in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 22 November to 13 December 1975.\n\nThe serial is set on the planet Oseidon and in England. In the serial, the alien race the Kraals plot to wipe out humanity with a virus to prepare the Earth for their invasion.\n\nThe serial was directed by former series producer Barry Letts and written by Terry Nation — his first \"Doctor Who\" script for eleven years not to feature his creations, the Daleks. The serial marks the last appearances in the programme of both John Levene in his recurring role as Sergeant Benton, and also of Ian Marter, who makes a guest appearance as previous companion Harry Sullivan.\n\nThe TARDIS materialises, apparently in the English countryside, where the Doctor detects an odd energy reading. He and Sarah Jane meet a group of men in white suits and opaque helmets who shoot at them with their index fingers. As they flee, the Doctor and Sarah see a UNIT soldier run over a cliff and fall to his death. The Doctor searches the body, finding a wallet full of freshly-minted coins, all dated the same year. They also spot a casket-shaped pod nearby, which the Doctor finds familiar. Pursued again by the white-suited men, they reach a deserted village, which Sarah recognises as Devesham; it is located near to a Space Defence Station. The Doctor finds the same coins in the register of the empty pub. The white suits enter the village, accompanied by the \"dead\" soldier. Villagers in a trance-like state arrive and distribute themselves around the village. Morgan, the pub landlord, enters along with several others while Sarah and the Doctor hide. The villagers take their seats silently, waiting motionless until the clock strikes, when they suddenly come to life, acting normally.\n\nThe Doctor intends to get to the Space Defence Station and contact UNIT. The soldier finds Sarah and questions her; Morgan suggests that Sarah might be part of \"the test\" and tells her to go. She observes that behind the visor of the white-suits are nothing but plastic and electronics. While examining one of the pods which she has found near to the TARDIS, the time machine dematerialises without her. Sarah is attacked by a man lying in the pod, but breaks free.\n\nAt the defence station, Senior Defence Astronaut Guy Crayford is addressed by the voice of Styggron, who orders him to check for an intruder. The Doctor enters Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart's office, but it is empty. Discovered by Crayford, the Doctor introduces himself as UNIT's scientific advisor, but is placed in detention. Sarah arrives and frees the Doctor from his cell, but is unaware that an alien — a Kraal — is observing them. When the Doctor tells Sarah about Crayford, she reveals that he vanished in deep space, presumed dead, during testing of a craft. The Doctor and Sarah are able to escape despite the efforts of Crayford's men, including their friends Sergeant Benton and Harry Sullivan, and are pursued by tracker dogs. When Sarah twists her ankle, the Doctor hides her in a tree. He is able to throw the dogs off his own trail, but when the soldiers turn back they capture Sarah. Styggron tells Crayford to locate, but not seize, the Doctor; he has other plans for him. In an alien-looking room, Sarah is strapped to a table and scanned by Harry. In the village, the Doctor finds that the telephones are not working. Styggron speaks to another Kraal, Chedaki, to discuss their experiments and plans to conquer Earth and other worlds. Styggron contacts Crayford and tells him to commence the final test.\n\nIn the pub, the Doctor finds more oddities, such as a tear-off calendar with only one date on every page, 6 July. He is telephoned by Sarah, who tells him that she was captured but managed to escape; she asks the Doctor to meet her in the village. Afterwards he finds that the telephone has stopped working again. The Doctor meets Sarah, who explains how she escaped. The Doctor remarks on the providence of her finding the only telephone in the village that worked; he believes they are being tested. Discovering the TARDIS has gone, the Doctor is puzzled, before realising it has continued its journey to Earth. This is not Earth, and \"Sarah\" is really an android duplicate since she's wearing the scarf that he took from her earlier. When the Doctor grabs the duplicate, it falls to the ground, its face opening to reveal the electronics underneath. The Doctor retreats as the android Sarah fires at him.\n\nStyggron tells Chedaki that the village and the Doctor will be destroyed by a matter-dissolving bomb. The real Sarah is being kept alive so Styggron can test the virus he intends to use on Earth. She subsequently escapes to the village and frees the Doctor, who has been captured by Styggron and tied up with the bomb at his feet. With seconds to spare, they run into the base and shut the door as the village dissolves into a wasteland, only to be captured by androids. The Doctor explains that the radiation levels he picked up earlier were those of Oseidon, the Kraal planet. The levels are increasing and the planet will soon be uninhabitable, hence the invasion of Earth. The duplicated village was an android training ground. Crayford enters and explains that he is helping the Kraals because they rescued him and reconstructed his body, while Earth left him for dead. He has contacted Earth with a cover story explaining his survival and with his return providing a distraction, the androids will also land on Earth, paving the way for the main invasion fleet. Although the Kraals have promised Crayford no humans will be harmed as long as they obey, Styggron subsequently reveals that he \"does\" intend to wipe out humanity using the androids to distribute the virus. Styggron leaves the Doctor to die strapped to the Kraal analysis table, but he is rescued by Sarah and they escape aboard Crayford's rocket. They eject from the rocket aboard pods and travel to Earth to warn the real defence station, but aboard another pod is an android Doctor. Meanwhile, having found the TARDIS in the woods near Devesham, the real Benton and Harry have been searching for the Doctor and Sarah.\n\nStation commander Colonel Faraday welcomes Crayford home on the radio, but the signal is broken up by the \"meteor shower\" of pods which slow down as they enter the atmosphere. The Doctor and Sarah land separately on Earth in their pods, and Sarah finds the TARDIS in the woods. As she looks around, the Doctor taps her on the shoulder. However, this Doctor is an android, and behind it a pod opens to reveal another Sarah replica. The real Sarah runs for it. When Crayford's rocket lands, Harry and Faraday head there, not knowing that Styggron is there with Crayford. The real Doctor enters the Station and meets Benton, who tells him where Harry and Faraday are. The Doctor contacts them by radio and urges them not to enter the rocket.\n\nThe Doctor tries to jam electronic equipment in the area using the Station's radar dish, and explains the Kraal invasion to Faraday. However, the Doctor is too late: Harry and Faraday have been replaced, and the android Doctor is pointing a gun at him. He escapes and meets Sarah, telling her their only chance is to stop the androids before they take over the complex. He runs back toward the scanner room, bluffing his way past \"Benton\" by posing as his duplicate. Sarah climbs up the rocket towards the real Harry and Faraday. The android Doctor is about to shoot the original when Crayford enters, saying that Styggron promised no killing. The android Doctor calls him a fool and tells him about the virus. Crayford cannot believe this, but the real Doctor tells him that his rocket was actually hijacked by the Kraal, and they did not reconstruct him but merely brainwashed him. Realising the truth, Crayford rushes out, distracting the android long enough for the Doctor to make his move. In the struggle, the Doctor manages to activate the power to the radar, jamming all the androids in mid-step. In the rocket, Sarah unties Harry and Faraday. Styggron enters, holding a ray gun on them, but Crayford appears and attacks him. The two grapple, and Styggron shoots Crayford. The Doctor makes his own entrance, punching the Kraal, who falls face first onto the vial of virus, cracking it open. Styggron shoots the Doctor before he dies. Sarah is horrified, but the real Doctor appears, revealing he had reprogrammed his duplicate to distract Styggron.\n\nWorking titles for this story included \"The Kraals\", \"The Kraal Invasion\", and \"The Enemy Within\". The story was influenced by the film \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1956), and would be the last Terry Nation script for \"Doctor Who\" for four years until his final script for the series, \"Destiny of the Daleks\" (1979). This was the first script by Nation since \"The Keys of Marinus\" (1964) that did not feature the Daleks.\n\nLocation filming for the Kraal-replicated village of Devesham took place in East Hagbourne, Oxfordshire, a few miles from Didcot. Scenes outside the Space Defence Station were filmed at the National Radiological Protection Board at nearby Harwell.\n\nNicholas Courtney was unavailable to play Lethbridge-Stewart, so his character was re-written as Colonel Faraday. Ian Marter would continue his acting career and go on to write several \"Doctor Who\" novelisations, an original novel featuring Harry and an unused screenplay, \"Doctor Who Meets Scratchman\", the last with Tom Baker. He died in 1986 from diabetes-related health complications.\n\nOnly three Kraals are seen throughout the story. Styggron was played by Martin Friend. Marshal Chedaki, was played by Roy Skelton. The silent Kraal underling that appears in one scene was played by the series' long time stuntman Stuart Fell. Milton Johns had appeared as Benik in \"The Enemy of the World\" (1967–68). His next appearance in \"Doctor Who\" would be as Castellan Kelner in \"The Invasion of Time\" (1978).\n\nKenneth Williams briefly mentioned viewing episode two of this story in his diaries, writing on 29 November 1975 \"\"Doctor Who\" gets more and more silly.\" Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a negative review in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995), writing that it was \"Stupid, tiresome and very irritating\". In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J Howe and Stephen James Walker reported that the serial had a mixed reception. They wrote that the Kraals were \"somewhat unoriginal but otherwise reasonable addition\", with average effects and the actors making the most of it. They also praised the direction, but wrote that the plot was too far-fetched. In 2010, Mark Braxton of \"Radio Times\" wrote that \"The Android Invasion\" was the weak link in the season. He criticised the plotting and use of UNIT, but was more positive towards the way the story played around with the android duplicates of characters. DVD Talk's Ian Jane gave the serial three and a half out of five stars, saying that it \"may not be the deepest or for that matter the most original of stories told in the series but it's a fun tale that breezes by at a good pace\". He praised the location work and the androids and white robots. \"SFX\" reviewer Ian Berriman also criticised the far-fetched plot, but said that it was \"as enjoyable as it is unlikely\".\n\n\"The Android Invasion\" was reviewed favourably by John Kenneth Muir, who described it as \"an atmosphere-laden suspense thriller\", despite finding some deficiencies in the storyline, which he referred to as an idiot plot. Muir praised the conceit of frightening, android duplicates of familiar people, and he traced influences from the films \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1956) and \"The Stepford Wives\" (1975). He also notes the similarity of the depiction of androids in \"Doctor Who\" to the Fembots that appeared the following year in The Bionic Woman television series (\"Kill Oscar\", 1976), with \"faces filled with circuitry and round, lifeless orbs for eyes\". Another familiar science-fiction device used in \"The Android Invasion\" is that of artificial duplicate settings; Muir considered that the \"fake\" village of Devesham imitated scenarios seen in earlier television series such as \"\" (\"The Mark of Gideon\", 1969), \"UFO\" (\"Reflections in the Water\", 1971) and \"\" (\"One Moment of Humanity\").\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in November 1978. The novelisation was later designated number 2 when Target opted to number the first seventy-three novelisations alphabetically; however no edition using the number was ever released.\n\n\"The Android Invasion\" was released on VHS in March 1995.

His father, Mihailo, was in the service of the Austro-Hungarian government and ran an experimental farm. Dimitrije was educated at Mostar Gymnasium. As a young student he was the formulator of the principal program of the political movement \"Mlada Bosna\" (Young Bosnia), in his country's struggle for independence from Austria-Hungary and in the moves to create a united Yugoslavia. During this period Mitrinović edited the Sarajevo literary paper, \"Bosanska Vila\", whose contributors included poets Risto Radulović and Vladimir \"Vlado\" Gaćinović. All three were born a few years apart in the late second half of the nineteenth century and all three have been members of secret political societies illegal in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Of the three friends, only Mitrinović survived World War I (Gaćinović died in 1917 and Radulović died in an Austrian prison camp in 1915).\n\nHaving studied history of art in Munich, Mitrinović came to England in 1914 to work for the Serbian Legation in London and moved among influential cultural circles in this country. From late 1914 to early 1915, there was an exhibition of work by Ivan Meštrović at the Victoria and Albert Museum, which included a model of a monument he had designed to commemorate the Battle of Kosovo.\n\nA mysterious personality in Serbian and European cultural history, he began his work in the field of art by translating \"Rig-Veda\" and the works of Virgil into Serbian. He studied philosophy and art history while staying in Rome, Madrid, Paris, Munich, and Tübingen. He was one of the first advocates of the avant-garde artistic group Der Blaue Reiter and gave a lecture on the art of Wassily Kandinsky.\n\nBeing in favour of the building of a universal utopia, like many of the leading minds of his time, he wrote about the inevitable creation of the Pan-European community. Ten years before \"La rebellión de las masas\" by Ortega y Gasset, Mitrinović prophesied: \"Being different from the other races, the population of Europe has always given birth to its contradictions and always with the chances of their solution in some ultimate synthesis.\"\n\nHe was a regular contributor to the epoch-making periodical \"The New Age\" (the author of the column \"World Affairs\"), alongside Ezra Pound, and according to Edwin Muir, Mitrinović \"has erupted with wild and profound contemplations ... not looking several ages ahead, like Shaw or Wells, but several millennia ahead.\"\n\nThe Utopian and messianic ideas of Mitrinović (incorporating the philosophical concepts of Husserl and Peter Demianovich Ouspensky, the theosophical doctrine of G. I. Gurdjieff, and the psychoanalytical school of Freud, Jung and Adler) were brought to the attention of the public not only in the periodical \"The New Age\" but also in the periodical \"The New Atlantis\" (which Mitrinović edited) and \"The New Albion\" (which he co-edited with A. R. Orage).\n\nMitrinović founded the \"Adler's Society\" (the English Branch of the International Society for Individual Psychology), but later he and Adler went different ways due, allegedly, to \"politicizing of his [Mitrinović's] scientific concepts\". Mitrinović later founded \"the New Europe Group\".\n\nMitrinović advocated a metaphysical Utopia (based on Plotinus, Clement of Alexandria, Lao Tzu, Jakob Böhme) but was also politically pragmatic. He published an open letter to Adolf Hitler in 1933 in which he accused Hitler of \"behaving and acting as an evil superman ... possessed with some weird vision\" which is \"incomprehensible for the human mind and belief and quite certainly, and in all forms and essence, directed against the Orthodox soul.\"\n\nThe works of Mitrinović have remained scattered in numerous European periodicals (like the provocative texts based on psychological and philosophical theories, such as: \"Frojd prema Adleru\" (\"Freud versus Adler\"), \"Značaj Jungovog dela\" (\"The Importance of Jung's Work\"), \"Marks i Niče kao istorijska pozadina Adlera\" (\"Marx and Nietzsche as the Historical Background of Adler\"), \"Načela genija\" (\"The Principles of Genius\"), \"Carstvo snova\" (\"The Realm of Dream\"). Many of his works (including much of his poetry) were published in Serbian periodicals, and one of his major works, \"Aesthetic Contemplations\", was published in \"Bosanska Vila\".\n\nIn addition to the selected works of Dimitrije Mitrinović (published in Serbian language, a number of years after his death) and the special study by Predrag Palavestra, \"Dogma i utopija\" (\"Dogma and Utopia\") published in Serbian language in 1977), two books have been distributed by Columbia University Press, New York; the first of them was published in 1984 and the second one in 1987. The authors of these books are Andrew Rigby (\"Initiation and Initiative: An Exploration of the Life and Ideas of Dimitrije Mitrinović\") and H. C. Rutherford (\"Certainly Future: Selected Writings by Dimitrije Mitrinović\").\n\nIn 1914, wishing to establish the movement \"The Fundamentals of the Future\", he maintained correspondence with the following potential associates: Giovanni Papini, Stanisław Przybyszewski, Martin Buber, Gershom Scholem, Upton Sinclair, Henri Bergson, H. G. Wells, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Leonid Andreyev, Maxim Gorky, Maurice Maeterlinck, Pablo Picasso, Filippo T. Marinetti, Anatole France, George Bernard Shaw, and Knut Hamsun.\n\nThe Mitrinović Library contains a collection of over 4,500 volumes, based on Mitrinović's private collection. The Library thus reflects Mitrinović's very wide range of interests and command of languages. Particular areas of strength are philosophy, politics, society, religions and esoterica. The collection includes rare books on art history, literature, psychology, history, science, oriental studies, astrology, Freemasonry, theosophy, and more. Most material is from the nineteenth and early twentieth century; the main languages used are English and German, with also French and some Asian and Eastern European languages.\n\nPart of the library was bequeathed to the Belgrade University Library in 1956 and part of it donated to University of Bradford in 2003 and 2004.\n\nThe archive that was donated to the University of Bradford by the Foundation \"New Atlantis\" in 2003 and 2004 includes published and unpublished writings of Mitrinović and documents and correspondence produced by members of Mitrinović's circle, of the \"New Europe Group\", and of the \"New Atlantis Foundation\".\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "1800015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800015", "title": "The Avett Brothers", "text": "The Avett Brothers\n\nThe Avett Brothers are an American folk rock band from Concord, North Carolina. The band is made up of two brothers, Scott Avett (banjo, lead vocals, guitar, piano, kick-drum) and Seth Avett (guitar, lead vocals, piano, hi-hat) along with Bob Crawford (double bass, electric bass, violin, backing vocals) and Joe Kwon (cello, backing vocals). Mike Marsh (drums) Tania Elizabeth (Fiddle) and Bonnie Avett-Rini (piano) are touring members of the band. \nFollowing on from Seth and Scott's former rock band Nemo, The Avett Brothers combine bluegrass, country, punk, pop melodies, folk, rock and roll, indie rock, honky tonk, and ragtime to produce a novel sound described by the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" as having the \"heavy sadness of Townes Van Zandt, the light pop concision of Buddy Holly, the tuneful jangle of the Beatles, the raw energy of the Ramones.\"\n\nScott and Seth Avett have played music together since childhood because their grandmother was a concert pianist and their father Jim Avett was a guitarist. Their collaborative partnership began in the late 1990s with the merger of Seth's Mount Pleasant High School rock band Margo and Scott's college group Nemo. Margo had released the song \"Dumbfight\" on a compilation album before merging with Nemo. After releasing three albums with Nemo, the Avetts started experimenting with acoustic music with some friends at night. After a few street performances and parties they performed under the names The Back Porch Project or Nemo Downstairs. The brothers and Nemo guitarist John Twomey put together an EP entitled \"The Avett Bros\" in 2000 while performing both as the Avett Brothers (with Scott, Seth and John) and as Nemo.\n\nWhen Nemo broke up Scott and Seth continued to write acoustic music together. In early 2001 the stand-up bassist Bob Crawford, formerly of the Memphis Quick 50, joined the Avetts, and the band released their first full-length album, \"Country Was\". The Avett Brothers set out on a self-booked tour to promote the new album and in late 2002 began preparations for a follow-up.\n\nAfter releasing a live album of original songs and covers entitled \"Live at the Double Door Inn\" the brothers settled down to compile a new full-length album. During this time the band began a partnership with Dolph Ramseur, a local label owner who had been impressed by the group's live show and original material. After 70 hours in the studio, the band recorded the album \"A Carolina Jubilee\", released by Ramseur Records in 2003. Unlike their previous albums, \"A Carolina Jubilee\" demonstrated the band's genre-crossing writing and performing.\n\nIn 2004, the band released their third album, \"Mignonette\", which featured polished harmonies, introspective lyrics and a sense of dedication that pushed the band to new heights. The album, running longer than 70 minutes, included vocals by the Avetts' sister Bonnie Avett and their father Jim Avett. \"Mignonette\" was named after an English yacht which sank off the Cape of Good Hope resulting in the cannibalism case \"R v Dudley and Stephens\".\n\nIn 2005 the band released \"Live, Volume 2\", recorded at the Neighborhood Theatre in Charlotte and King's Baracade in Raleigh, North Carolina. The album spanned material from their career up to that point.\n\nIn early 2006 the band released \"\" to much acclaim. The album was recorded in a lake house in Robbinsville, North Carolina, over the course of 10 days and included collaborations with Paleface and Ian Thomas. The album was titled \"Four Thieves Gone\" after Scott Avett realized their song \"Denouncing November Blue\" sounded identical to the Charlie Daniels song \"Uneasy Rider\", whom they ultimately credited with the songwriting.\n\nDuring extensive touring in support of the album Scott and Seth Avett produced \"The Gleam\", an EP of intimate, stripped-down recordings, which was released in September 2006. They were inspired to create the album as a duo after their experience writing and recording \"Famous Flower of Manhattan\" during the \"Four Thieves Gone\" sessions.\n\nThe band released \"Emotionalism\" on May 15, 2007. It debuted at the top of the \"Billboard\" Top Heatseekers Albums chart, number 134 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 13 on the Independent Artist Chart. In support of the album the band made their national television debut on May 12 on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" performing \"Paranoia in B-Flat Major.\" \"Emotionalism\" marked the first appearance of the cellist Joe Kwon who has since become a full-time touring and recording member of the band.\n\nOn November 1, 2007 the Americana Music Association presented the Avett Brothers with two awards, as Duo/Group of the Year and as New/Emerging Artist of the Year. In July 2008, the band released \"The Second Gleam\", a stripped-down acoustic album like \"The Gleam\". In the same month, the band announced they had chosen Rick Rubin to produce their next album and were now signed to his American Recordings label.\n\nFrom September 8 to October 8, 2009, the Avett Brothers released 13 short videos describing their music and fans in anticipation of their upcoming album, \"I and Love and You\". The videos included clips from past concerts, fan interviews and interviews with the members of the band. \"I and Love and You\", released on September 29, 2009, peaked at number 16 on the \"Billboard\" 200 best-selling albums chart, number 8 on the best-selling digital albums chart, number 7 on the rock albums chart, and number 1 on the folk albums chart.\n\nIn the wake of the album's release the Avett Brothers appeared on late-night TV programs, including the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\", and \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\". On January 21, 2010 the band was featured on the long-running PBS series \"Austin City Limits.\"\n\nIn January 2010 drummer Jacob Edwards was added to the Avetts' touring lineup. In the fall of 2010 the band released their third live album and first concert DVD, \"Live, Volume 3.\" The performance was recorded the previous year during the band's homecoming concert at Bojangles' Coliseum in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nIn early 2011, Avett Brothers bassist Bob Crawford learned that his daughter Hallie had a seizure due to a brain tumor. He took a hiatus from the band and was temporarily replaced by Langhorne Slim bassist Paul Defiglia. Crawford returned to play with the band on the 53rd Grammy Awards in 2011, performing \"Head Full of Doubt/Road Full of Promise\" and then joining Mumford and Sons and Bob Dylan for a performance of \"Maggie's Farm.\" After successful treatment at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital his daughter's condition stabilized, and he returned to the band. The band kept Defiglia as a touring member, playing organ, double bass, and keyboard.\n\nIn 2011, the band began the demo process for the followup to \"I and Love and You\" for a 2012 release, also produced by Rick Rubin. 24 songs were recorded. On June 26, 2012, the Avett Brothers released a preview of the single \"Live and Die\" on NPR Music and announced that their sixth studio album, \"The Carpenter\", would be released on September 11, 2012. It debuted at number 4 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and was nominated for the Grammy award for Best Americana Album at 55th annual Grammy Awards. Jacob Edwards left the band in December 2012. Mike Marsh, formerly the drummer of Dashboard Confessional, which recorded songs from \"I and Love and You\", joined the band as a touring member at their annual New Year's Eve show in 2012.\n\nOn June 12, 2013, the Avett Brothers announced that a follow-up companion to \"The Carpenter\" would be released in the fall of 2013. On July 27, at the Newport Folk Festival, the band announced that the new album would be entitled \"Magpie and the Dandelion\". On August 8, they told NPR that \"Magpie and the Dandelion\", which consisted mostly of songs recorded during sessions for \"The Carpenter\", would be released on October 15, 2013. The NPR announcement also premiered their new single \"Another Is Waiting.\" The album was released to generally warm reviews and peaked at number 5 on the \"Billboard\" 200 during its first week. Tania Elizabeth, who had recorded with the Avetts during the \"Magpie and the Dandelion\" sessions, began touring with the band on November 21, 2013.\n\nNear the end of May 2014, Seth Avett and Bob Crawford mentioned in different interviews they were recording demos for their next album, to be produced by Rick Rubin. During their concert on December 13, 2014, in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Seth and Scott mentioned they spent November recording songs for their upcoming album. In November 2015 Seth updated the release estimate to be \"early 2016.\"\n\nOn November 23, 2015, the band announced their fourth live album and second concert DVD, titled \"Live, Vol. Four\" would be released on December 18, 2015. The live album was recorded at their concert in Raleigh, North Carolina, on December 31, 2014. While touring in support of \"Live, Vol. Four\" the band spoke of their ninth studio album.\n\nOn March 3, 2016, the band announced the expected release of their ninth full-length studio album, \"True Sadness,\" which Seth Avett described as \"a patchwork quilt, both thematically and stylistically.\" The album was released on June 24, 2016 and debuted at number 3 on the \"Billboard\" Top 200, topping the U.S. Folk and U.S. Top Rock charts, though reviews were mixed. \"Entertainment Weekly\" praised the band's experimentation and \"willingness to tear down boundaries\" while \"Pitchfork\" criticized the \"baffling layers of synthesizers in what feels like a ploy to push the Avetts into clear Top 40 territory.\" The album was nominated for two awards, Best Americana Album and Best Americana Roots Performance (the album's lead single, \"Ain't No Man\"), at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. On January 31, 2017, it was announced that a documentary about the production of \"True Sadness\", entitled \"May It Last: A Portrait of the Avett Brothers\", directed by Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio, would premiere at the 2017 South by Southwest film festival. The documentary was released on HBO on January 29, 2018. \n\nAlso during this period, in October 2016, the band was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame. While the core four members of the band remained the same, however, the remaining line-up of the band continued to evolve. On August 18, 2017, the band announced that keyboardist Paul Defiglia would be leaving the band on September 3, 2017. Scott and Seth's older sister Bonnie Avett Rini immediately joined them on tour playing piano. And on August 27, 2018 Tania Elizabeth announced on Instagram that she was taking maternity leave from the band but returned for the majority of their 2019 tour. \n\nOn December 21, 2017 Scott Avett mentioned in an interview that they were again working with producer Rick Rubin on new material. Ten months later, in October 2018, the band debuted the song \"Roses & Sacrifice\" on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\", and in an interview Scott Avett stated their next album would release the following year, in 2019, describing the album as “by no means a political record, but it’s more about blatant social and political issues than ever before.\" The next month, on November 16, 2018, \"Roses & Sacrifice\" was released as a single on the American Recordings label, with follow-up singles \"Trouble Letting Go\" and \"Neapolitan Sky\" released on December 21, 2018 and February 1, 2019, respectively. On May 6 the band released \"Sun, Flood, or Drought,\" a song featured in the documentary \"The Biggest Little Farm.\" On June 13 the band announced that their next album would be titled \"Closer Than Together,\" to be released on October 4, 2019, and described as \"informed by what is happening now.\" The album reached #2 on the Billboard Americana/Folk charts.\n\nThe band also announced that a musical based on their music, titled \"Swept Away\", would debut at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in June 2020. In a February 2020 interview, Scott Avett stated \"we plan to at least have another release this year if all goes well.\"\n\nPermanent members\nTouring musicians\n\nPrevious members\n\nTimeline\n\nStudio albums\n\nAmericana Music Honors & Awards\n\nGrammy Awards\n\n\nReferences to and lyrics by The Avett Brothers feature prominently in \"Slammed\", a \"New York Times\" best-selling romance novel by Colleen Hoover.\n\n"}

{"id": "1800030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800030", "title": "Rhodesian Bush War", "text": "Rhodesian Bush War\n\nThe Rhodesian Bush War—also called the Second Chimurenga and the Zimbabwe War of Liberation—was a civil conflict from July 1964 to December 1979 in the unrecognised country of Rhodesia (later Zimbabwe-Rhodesia).\nThe conflict pitted three forces against one another: the Rhodesian white minority-led government of Ian Smith (later the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian government of Bishop Abel Muzorewa); the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army, the military wing of Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union; and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army of Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union.\n\nThe war and its subsequent Internal Settlement, signed in 1978 by Smith and Muzorewa, led to the implementation of universal suffrage in June 1979 and the end of white minority rule in Rhodesia, which was renamed Zimbabwe Rhodesia under a black majority government. However, this new order failed to win international recognition and the war continued. Neither side achieved a military victory and a compromise was later reached.\n\nNegotiations between the government of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, the UK Government and Mugabe and Nkomo's united \"Patriotic Front\" took place at Lancaster House, London in December 1979, and the Lancaster House Agreement was signed. The country returned temporarily to British control and new elections were held under British and Commonwealth supervision in March 1980. ZANU won the election and Mugabe became the first Prime Minister of Zimbabwe on 18 April 1980, when the country achieved internationally recognised independence.\n\nThe origin of the war in Rhodesia can be traced to the conquest of the region by the British South Africa Company in the late 19th century, and the dissent of native leaders who opposed foreign rule. Britons began settling in Southern Rhodesia from the 1890s, and while it was never accorded full dominion status, these settlers effectively governed the country after 1923.\n\nIn his famous \"Wind of Change\" speech, UK Prime Minister Harold Macmillan revealed Britain's new policy to only permit independence to its African colonies under majority rule. But many white Rhodesians were concerned that such immediate change would cause chaos as had resulted in the former Belgian Congo after its independence in 1960.\n\nBritain's unwillingness to compromise led to Rhodesia's unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) on 11 November 1965. Although Rhodesia had the private support of neighbouring South Africa and Portugal, which still owned Mozambique, it never gained formal diplomatic recognition from any country.\n\nAlthough the vote in Rhodesia was constitutionally open to all, regardless of race, property requirements left many blacks unable to participate. The new 1969 constitution reserved eight seats in the 66 seat parliament for \"Non-Europeans\" only, with a further eight reserved for tribal chiefs.\n\nAmidst this backdrop, African nationalists advocated armed struggle to bring about black rule, primarily denouncing the wealth disparity between the races. Two rival nationalist organisations emerged in August 1963: the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) and the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), after disagreements about tactics, as well as tribalism and personality clashes. ZANU and its military wing ZANLA were headed by Robert Mugabe and consisted primarily of Shona tribes. ZAPU and its military wing ZIPRA consisted mainly of Ndebele under Joshua Nkomo.\n\nCold War politics played into the conflict. The Soviet Union supported ZIPRA and China supported ZANLA. Each group fought a separate war against the Rhodesian security forces, and the two groups sometimes fought against each other as well. In June 1979, the governments of Cuba and Mozambique offered direct military help to the Patriotic Front, but Mugabe and Nkomo declined. Other foreign contributions included from North Korea military officials who taught Zimbabwean militants to use explosives and arms in a camp near Pyongyang. By April 1979, 12,000 ZANLA guerrillas were training in Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Libya while 9,500 of its 13,500 extant cadres operated in Rhodesia. South Africa clandestinely gave material and military support to the Rhodesian government.\n\nBacked by proxy by the United States and its Western allies, the Rhodesian Front (RF) took an uncompromising position against the communist ideology of the ZIPRA and ZANLA. Ian Smith further expounded this by portraying the conflict as primarily anti-communist in nature. The Rhodesian whites, and a percentage of well-off blacks, viewed the British demand for majority-rule as a direct attack on their way of life. Having previously witnessed the communist redistribution of resources after the Mau Mau Rebellion, Rhodesians refused to allow the majority-rule policy to come into effect. Much of the Rhodesian economy as well as the land was controlled by white Rhodesians, and, fearing total confiscation by either the ZIPRA or ZANLA, the RF elected to hold onto the unofficial minority-rule. In ignoring other contributing factors to the conflict, Smith and the RF were able to strengthen ties with the West, however, Britain remained neutral. The division between the communists and anti-communists caused the fighting to spill over the Rhodesian borders. Neighboring African nations, supported primarily by North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, utilized communist material support to begin launching guerrilla attacks on the RF.\n\nThe United States took the official position that it would not recognize Rhodesia as an independent sovereign. However, many American soldiers who had seen combat in Vietnam quickly joined into the Rhodesian Front. The RF created advertising campaigns in order to attract soldiers from Western countries, and the RF amassed a force of nearly 1,400 soldiers that were highly trained in special forces and guerrilla warfare, bringing the total RF military force to over 10,000 men. Many of the professional American soldiers entering the RF directly into the force became de facto members of the Rhodesian government.\n\nThe Soviet Union became extremely invested in the Rhodesian Bush War. This was jointly in efforts to combat the push from the anti-communist West and to challenge the Chinese presence in the region. Soviet military technology quickly appeared in the Zimbabwean countryside and by 1979 the ZIPRA were utilizing SAM weaponry to target Rhodesian civilian assets and Viscount aircraft. Just as they had done in various other African countries and conflicts, the Russians supported opposition forces in weapons and formal training, however, the Russian assistance diminished significantly throughout the Bush war as the domestic Soviet economy began to fall apart. In addition to the physical assistance offered by the Soviet Union, Moscow launched a large propaganda campaign over-exaggerating British involvement in the conflict in order to boost support for intervention. While the Soviets were large suppliers of munitions and training, they refused to directly enter the conflict. The Chinese, on the other hand, were limited in their abilities to offer tangible aid to the ZANLA. Chinese influence throughout the conflict was primarily focused on small scale sabotage efforts and anti-western propaganda.\n\nInevitably, the Bush War occurred within the context of regional Cold War in Africa, and became embroiled in conflicts in several neighbouring countries. Such conflicts included the Angolan War of Independence (1961–1975) and Angolan Civil War (1975–2002), the Mozambican War of Independence (1964–1974) and Mozambican Civil War (1977–1992), the South African Border War (1966–1989), and the Shaba I (1977) and Shaba II (1978) conflicts.\n\nThe conflict was seen by the nationalist groups and the UK Government of the time as a war of national and racial liberation. The Rhodesian government saw the conflict as a fight between one part of the country's population (the Whites) on behalf of the whole population (including the Black majority) against several externally financed parties made up of predominantly Black radicals and communists. The Nationalists considered their country occupied and dominated by a foreign power, namely Britain, since 1890.\n\nThe British government, in the person of the Governor, had indirectly ruled the country from 1923, when it took over from the British South Africa Company and granted self-governing status to a locally elected government, made up predominantly of Whites. Ian Smith's Rhodesian Front party was elected to power in 1962 and unilaterally declared independence on 11 November 1965 to preserve what it saw as the self-government it had possessed since 1923.\n\nThe Rhodesian government contended that it was defending Western values, Christianity, the rule of law and democracy by fighting Communists, but it was unwilling to compromise on most political, economic and social inequalities. The Smith administration claimed that the legitimate voice of the black Shona and Ndebele population were the traditional chiefs, not the ZANU and ZAPU nationalists, whom it regarded as dangerous, violent usurpers.\n\nIn 1978–1979, the Smith administration tried to blunt the power of the nationalist cause by acceding to an \"Internal Settlement\" which ended minority rule, changed the name of the country to Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, and arranged multiracial elections, which were held in 1979 and won by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, who became the country's first Black head of government. Unsatisfied with this and spurred on by Britain's refusal to recognise the new order, the nationalist forces persisted.\n\nThe war ended when, at the behest of both South Africa (its major supporter) and the United States, the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian government ceded power to Britain in the Lancaster House Agreement in December 1979. The UK Government held another election in 1980 to form a new government. The election was won by ZANU. The new government, headed by Robert Mugabe, was recognised internationally, and the country was renamed Zimbabwe.\n\n Despite the effect of economic and diplomatic sanctions, Rhodesia developed and maintained a powerful and professional military. In June 1977, \"Time\" magazine reported that \"man for man, the Rhodesian army ranks among the world's finest fighting units.\"\n\nThe army was always relatively small, just 3,400 regular troops in 1970. By 1978–79 it had grown to some 10,800 regulars nominally supported by about 40,000 reservists – although by the last year of the war, perhaps as few as 15,000 were available for active service. While the regular army consisted of a professional core of white soldiers (and some units, such as the Rhodesian SAS and the Rhodesian Light Infantry, were all-white), by 1978–1979 the rest was majority black.\n\nBy contrast, army reserves were largely white, and toward the end of the war were increasingly called up to deal with the growing insurgency. The regular army was supported by the para-military British South Africa Police of about 8,000 to 11,000 men (the majority of whom were black) and 19,000 to 35,000 police reservists (which, like their army counterparts, were largely white). The police reserves acted as a type of home guard.\n\nThe war saw the extensive operation of Rhodesian regulars as well as elite units such as the Selous Scouts and the Rhodesian SAS. The Rhodesian Army fought bitterly against the black nationalist guerrillas. The Rhodesian Army also comprised mostly black regiments such as the Rhodesian African Rifles. As the war went on, the frequent call-up of reservists was increasingly used to supplement the professional soldiers and the many volunteers from overseas.\n\nBy 1978, all white men up to the age of 60 were subject to periodic call-up to the army; younger men up to 35 might expect to spend alternating blocks of six weeks in the army and at home. Many of the overseas volunteers came from Britain, Ireland, South Africa, Portugal, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America with the latter three being held in high regard for their recent Vietnam War experience.\n\nConsidering the arms embargo, the Rhodesian Army was well-equipped. The standard infantry weapon was the Belgian FN FAL Rifle as produced in South Africa under license as the R1 Rifle and supplemented by the H&K G3 rifle that came from Portuguese forces. However, other weapons such as the British L1A1 ('SLR') variant of the FAL and the older British Lee–Enfield bolt-action rifle were used by reservists and the British South Africa Police. Other weapons included the Bren LMG in both .303\" and 7.62mm NATO, Sten SMG, Uzi, Browning Hi-Power pistol, Colt M16 rifle (very late in the war), FN MAG (FN MAG58) general-purpose machine-gun, 81 mm mortar, and Claymore mines. After UDI, Rhodesia was heavily reliant on South African and domestically produced weapons and equipment, as well as international smuggling operations, commonly referred to as \"sanction-busting\". South Africa provided extensive support to Rhodesia in the form of a Lend / Lease program and both the official and unofficial support of many branches of the South African armed forces.\n\nThe Rhodesian Air Force (RhAF) operated a variety of equipment and carried out numerous roles, with air power providing the Rhodesians with a significant advantage over their guerrilla enemy. The fleet consisted mainly of British aircraft and largely obsolete aircraft, such as the World War II vintage Douglas Dakota transport aircraft and the British de Havilland Vampire. The arms embargo caused a lack of spare parts from external suppliers and RhAF had to find alternative means to keep its aircraft flying. The larger South African Air Force provided extensive training, aircraft and aircrews in support of RhAF operations from 1966. The Rhodesians also used more modern types of aircraft like the Hawker Hunter and Canberra bombers, the Cessna Skymaster as well as Aérospatiale Alouette III (SA316) helicopters until they were supplemented by the Agusta Bell 205. Very late in the war, the Rhodesian forces were able to smuggle and use a few Agusta Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopters.\n\nAt the beginning of the war, much of Rhodesia's military hardware was of British and Commonwealth origin, but during the course of the conflict, new equipment such as Eland armoured cars were procured from South Africa. Several Polish-made T-55 tanks destined for Idi Amin's regime in Uganda were diverted to Rhodesia by the South Africans, in the last year of the war. The Rhodesians also produced a wide range of wheeled mine-proofed armoured vehicles, often using Mercedes Unimog, Land Rover and Bedford truck components, including unlicensed copies of the Mercedes-Benz UR-416.\n\nDuring the course of the war, most white citizens carried personal weapons, and it was not unusual to see white housewives carrying submachine guns. A siege mentality set in and all civilian transport had to be escorted in convoys for safety against ambushes. Farms and villages in rural areas were frequently attacked by guerrillas.\n\nThe Rhodesian government divided the country into eight geographical operational areas: North West Border (Operation Ranger), Eastern Border (Operation Thrasher), North East Border (Operation Hurricane), South East Border (Operation Repulse), Midlands (Operation Grapple), Kariba (Operation Splinter), Matabeleland (Operation Tangent), Salisbury and District (\"SALOPS\").\nThe two major armed groups campaigning against Ian Smith's government were the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), the armed wing of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), the armed wing of the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). The fighting was largely rural, as the two rival movements tried to win peasant support and to recruit fighters while harassing the administration and the white civilians. To ensure local domination, ZANLA and ZIPRA sometimes fought against each other as well as against the security forces.\n\nZANLA was the armed wing of ZANU. The organisation also had strong links with Mozambique's independence movement, FRELIMO. ZANLA, in the end, was present on a more or less permanent basis in over half the country, as evidenced by the location of the demobilisation bases at the end of the war, which were in every province except Matabeleland North. In addition, they were fighting a civil war against ZIPRA, despite the formation of a joint front by their political parties after 1978. It was ZANLA's intention to occupy the ground, supplant the administration in rural areas, and then mount the final conventional campaign. ZANLA concentrated on the politicisation of the rural areas using force, persuasion, ties of kinship and collaboration with spirit mediums.\n\nZANLA tried to paralyse the Rhodesian effort and economy by planting Soviet anti-tank land mines on the roads. From 1972 to 1980 there were 2,504 vehicle detonations of land mines (mainly Soviet TM46s), killing 632 people and injuring 4,410. Mining of roads increased 33.7% from 1978 (894 mines or 2.44 mines were detonated or recovered per day) to 1979 (2,089 mines or 5.72 mines a day).\n\nIn response, the Rhodesians co-operated with the South Africans to develop a range of mine protected vehicles. They began by replacing air in tyres with water which absorbed some of the blast and reduced the heat of the explosion. Initially, they protected the bodies with steel deflector plates, sandbags and mine conveyor belting. Later, purpose built vehicles with V shaped blast hulls dispersed the blast and deaths in such vehicles became unusual events.\n\nZIPRA was the anti-government force based around the Ndebele ethnicity, led by Joshua Nkomo, and the ZAPU political organisation. In contrast to ZANLA's Mozambique links, Nkomo's ZIPRA was more oriented towards Zambia for local bases. However, this was not always with full Zambian government support: by 1979, the combined forces based in Zambia of ZIPRA, \"Umkhonto we Sizwe\" (the armed wing of the African National Congress of South Africa) and South-West African SWAPO fighters were a major threat to Zambia's internal security. Because ZAPU's political strategy relied more heavily on negotiations than armed force, ZIPRA grew slower and less elaborately than ZANLA, but by 1979 it had an estimated 20,000 combatants, almost all based in camps around Lusaka, Zambia.\n\nZIPRA was responsible for two attacks on civilian Air Rhodesia Viscount aeroplanes, on 3 September 1978 and 12 February 1979. Using SA-7 surface-to-air missiles, the guerrillas shot down each plane during its ascent from Kariba Airport. ZIPRA took advice from its Soviet instructors in formulating its vision and strategy of popular revolution. About 1,400 Soviets, 700 East German and 500 Cuban instructors were deployed to the area.\n\nOn the advice of the Soviets, ZIPRA built up its conventional forces, and motorised with Soviet armoured vehicles and a number of small aeroplanes, in Zambia. ZIPRA's (i.e. ZAPU's) intention was to allow ZANLA to bring the Rhodesian forces to the point of defeat, and then take the victory from the much lighter forces of ZANLA and the essentially defeated Rhodesians. ZIPRA kept a light presence within Rhodesia, reconnoitring, keeping contact with the peasants and sometimes skirmishing with ZANLA.\n\nZIPRA's conventional threat partly distracted Rhodesian forces from fighting ZANLA. By the late 1970s, ZIPRA had developed a strategy known as \"Storming the Heavens\" to launch a conventional invasion from Zambia, supported by a limited number of armoured vehicles and light aircraft. An operation by the Rhodesian armed forces to destroy a ZIPRA base near Livingstone in Zambia was never launched.\n\nThe ZAPU/ZIPRA strategy for taking over Zimbabwe proved unsuccessful. In any event, the transfer of power to black nationalists took place not by the military take-over expected by ZAPU/ZIPRA, but by a peaceful and internationally supervised election. Rhodesia reverted to British rule as the colony of Southern Rhodesia (the UK had never recognized Rhodesia's declaration of independence,) and a general election took place in early 1980, supervised by British and other international forces.\n\nRobert Mugabe (of ZANLA/ZANU) won this election, because he was the only major competitor of the majority ethnicity, Shona. Once in power, Mugabe was internationally recognised as Zimbabwe's leader and was installed as head of government, and had the backing of the overwhelming majority ethnic group. He was therefore able to quickly and irreversibly consolidate his power, forcing ZAPU, and therefore ZIPRA which was ZAPU's army, to give up hope of taking over the country in the place of ZANU/ZANLA.\n\nIn September 1956, bus fares in Salisbury were raised so high that workers were spending 18% to 30% of their earnings on transportation. In response, the City Youth League boycotted the United Transport Company's buses and succeeded in preventing the price change. On 12 September 1957 members of the Youth League and the defunct ANC formed the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, led by Joshua Nkomo. The Whitehead administration banned the SRANC in 1959 and arrested 307 leaders, excluding Nkomo who was out of the country, on 29 February in Operation Sunrise.\n\nNkomo, Mugabe, Herbert Chitepo, and Ndabaningi Sithole established the National Democratic Party in January 1960. Nkomo became its leader in October. An NDP delegation headed by Nkomo attended the constitutional conference in January 1961. While Nkomo initially supported the constitution, he reversed his position after other NDP leaders disagreed. The government banned the NDP in December 1961 and arrested NDP leaders, excluding Nkomo who, again, was out of the country. Nkomo formed the Zimbabwe African People's Union which the Whitehead administration banned in September 1962.\n\nThe United Federal Party (UFP) had been in power since 1934, earning it the nickname of \"the establishment\", and roughly represented Southern Rhodesian commercial and major agricultural interests. The UFP contested the 1962 general election on a ticket of racial \"partnership\", whereby blacks and whites would work together. All ethnically discriminatory legislation would be immediately repealed, including the Land Apportionment Act, which defined certain areas of the land as eligible for purchase only by blacks, others as exclusively for whites, and others as open for all races.\n\nAbout 45% of the country was split in this way; another 45% comprised reserved Tribal Trust Lands, which housed tribesmen, and gave local chiefs and headmen a degree of self-government in a similar manner to American Indian reservations. The remainder was national land. The country had originally been split up in this way during the early days of white immigration to prevent the new arrivals from using their superior finances to buy all of the land in the country.\n\nThe UFP proposed to repeal the black and white purchase areas, but keep the Tribal Trust and national lands. It also committed to general black advancement. These proposals proved largely repugnant to the mostly white electorate, which feared that premature black ascendancy would threaten Rhodesia's economic prosperity and security, as well as their own personal affairs.\n\nMost turned away from the ruling UFP party, causing it to lose in the 1962 election to the newly formed Rhodesian Front (RF), a conservative party opposed to any immediate shift to black rule. Winston Field and Ian Smith became Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, respectively. Nkomo, legally barred from forming a new party, moved ZAPU's headquarters to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\n\nIn July 1963, Nkomo suspended Ndabaningi Sithole, Robert Mugabe, Leopold Takawira, and Washington Malianga for their opposition to his continued leadership of ZAPU. On 8 August, they announced the establishment of the Zimbabwe African National Union. ZANU members formed a militant wing, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army, and sent ZANLA members to the People's Republic of China for training.\n\nOn 4 July 1964, ZANU insurgents ambushed and murdered a white foreman from Silverstreams Wattle Company, Pieter Johan Andries (Andrew) Oberholzer. The killing had a lasting effect on the small, close-knit white community. The Smith administration detained ZANU and ZAPU leaders in August 1964. The major leaders imprisoned were Ndabaningi Sithole, Leopold Takawira, Edgar Tekere, Enos Nkala and Maurice Nyagumbo. The remaining military leaders of the ZANLA Dare ReChimurenga were Josiah Tongogara and the barrister Herbert Chitepo. Operating from bases in Zambia and later from Mozambique, militants began launching attacks against Rhodesia.\n\nThe conflict intensified after Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from Britain on 11 November 1965. Sanctions (embargo) were imposed by Britain and endorsed by member states of the United Nations. The embargo meant the Rhodesia was hampered by a lack of modern equipment but it used other means to receive vital war supplies such as oil, munitions, and arms via the apartheid government of South Africa. War material was also obtained through elaborate international smuggling schemes, domestic production, and captured infiltrating enemy combatants.\n\nFive months later, on 28 April 1966, the Rhodesian Security Forces engaged militants in Sinoia, during the first major engagement of the war. Seven ZANLA men were killed, and in retaliation the survivors killed two civilians at their farm near Hartley three weeks later.\n\nDuring Portuguese rule of Mozambique, until 1974–1975, Rhodesia was able to defend its border with Zambia relatively easily and prevent many guerrilla incursions. It set up a strong defense along the Zambezi River running from Lake Kariba to the Mozambique border. Here 30-man camps were established at 8-kilometre intervals supported by mobile rapid reaction units. From 1966 to 1970, these defences accounted for 175 insurgents killed for the loss of 14 defenders. The conflict continued at a low level until 21 December 1972 when ZANLA conducted the attack on Altena Farm in north-east Rhodesia. In response, the Rhodesians moved to attack nationalists in their foreign camps and staging areas before they could infiltrate into Rhodesia.\n\nSecret cross-border operations by the Special Air Service began in the mid-1960s, with Rhodesian Security Forces already engaging in hot pursuits into Mozambique. However, three weeks after the attack on Altena Farm, ZANLA killed two civilians and abducted a third into Mozambique and then Tanzania. In response, SAS troops were inserted into Mozambique with the approval of the Portuguese administration, in the first officially sanctioned external operation. The Rhodesian government began authorising an increasing number of external operations.\n\nIn the first phase of the conflict (until the end of 1972), Rhodesia's political and military position was strong. Nationalist guerrillas did not make serious inroads. In the early 1970s, the two main nationalist groups faced serious internal divisions, aid from the Organisation of African Unity was temporarily suspended in 1971, and 129 nationalists were expelled from Zambia after they were alleged to have plotted against President Kenneth Kaunda.\n\nBritain's efforts to isolate Rhodesia economically had not produced major compromises by the Smith Government. Indeed, late in 1971 the British and Rhodesian Governments had negotiated a compromise political settlement which would have bowed to the Smith Government's agenda of postponing majority rule into the indefinite future. Nevertheless, when it was found that such a delayed approach to majority rule was unacceptable to most of Rhodesia's African population, the deal fell apart.\n\nIn 1971, Rhodesia joined Alcora Exercise, a secret defensive alliance for Southern Africa, formalised in 1970 by Portugal and South Africa. Alcora formalised and deepened the political and military co-operation between the three countries against the revolutionary insurgency in Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique and South West Africa and against the hostile neighbouring countries.\n\nHowever, the end of Portuguese rule in Mozambique created new military and political pressures on the Rhodesian Government to accept the principle of immediate majority rule.\n\nThe black nationalists continued to operate from secluded bases in neighbouring Zambia and from FRELIMO-controlled areas in the Portuguese colony of Mozambique, making periodic raids into Rhodesia. By 1973, guerrilla activity was increasing in the aftermath of the Altena Farm raid, particularly in the northeast part of the country where portions of the African population were evacuated from border areas, and compulsory military service for whites was extended to one year. As the war intensified, conscription was raised to men between the ages of 38 and 50, though this was modified in 1977. No white male 17-year-olds were allowed to leave the country.\n\nIn April 1974, the left-wing Carnation Revolution in Portugal heralded the coming end of colonial rule in Mozambique. A transitional government was formed within months and Mozambique became independent under FRELIMO rule on 25 June 1975. Such events proved beneficial to ZANLA and disastrous for the Rhodesians, adding of hostile border. Indeed, with the demise of the Portuguese Empire, Ian Smith realised Rhodesia was surrounded on three sides by hostile nations and declared a formal state of emergency. Soon Mozambique closed its border, however Rhodesian forces continued to cross the border in \"hot pursuit\" raids, attacking the nationalists and their training camps, and engaged in skirmishes with Mozambican security forces.\n\nBy 1975–1976, it was clear that an indefinite postponement of majority rule, which had been the cornerstone of the Smith Government's strategy since UDI, was no longer viable. Even overt South African support for Rhodesia was waning. South Africa began scaling back economic assistance to Rhodesia, placed limits on the amount of fuel and munitions being supplied to the Rhodesian military, and withdrew the personnel and equipment they had previously provided to aid the war effort, including a border police unit that had been helping guard the Rhodesia-Zambia border.\n\nIn 1976, the length of active military service was extended to 18 months; this took effect immediately, with soldiers about to end their one-year service finding their active service extended. Even after discharge from regular service, white men entered the reserve forces, and were often called up for duty and subjected to long military service. In addition, Rhodesia recruited black men to volunteer for military service; by 1976, half of the Rhodesian Army was composed of black soldiers. Although some raised questions about their loyalty, the Rhodesian government stated that it had no doubts about their loyalty, and planned to train black officers. Legislation to conscript blacks was introduced and came in effect in 1979, but the response to call-ups was poor. Rhodesia also recruited foreign volunteers for service, with groups of foreigners who served in Rhodesia including the Crippled Eagles and 7 Independent Company.\n\nLate in 1976, Ian Smith accepted the basic elements of the compromise proposals made by US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to introduce majority rule within two years. The Smith Government then sought to negotiate an acceptable settlement with moderate black leaders, while retaining strong white influence in key areas. The Rhodesian military, in turn, aimed to erode the rising military strength of the ZANLA and ZIPRA to the greatest extent possible in order \"buy time\" for an acceptable political settlement to be reached.\n\nAs the war continued to intensify, the Rhodesian Security Forces initiated a Chemical and Biological Weapons (CBW) programme to kill guerrillas both inside Rhodesia and in external camps in Zambia and Mozambique. The effort had three fronts. First, it aimed to eliminate guerrillas operating inside Rhodesia through contaminated supplies either provided by contact men, recovered from hidden caches, or stolen from rural stores.\n\nSecondly, it aimed to contaminate water supplies along guerrilla infiltration routes into Rhodesia, forcing the guerrillas to either travel through arid regions to carry more water and less ammunition or travel through areas patrolled by the security forces. Finally, the Rhodesians sought to hit the guerrillas in their camps in Mozambique by poisoning food, beverages, and medicines.\n\nThe chemicals most used in the Rhodesian programme were parathion (an organophosphate insecticide) and thallium (a heavy metal commonly found in rodenticide). Biological agents the Rhodesians selected for use also included \"Vibrio cholerae\" (causative agent of cholera) and possibly \"Bacillus anthracis\" (causative agent of anthrax). They also looked at using \"Rickettsia prowazekii\" (causative agent of epidemic typhus), and \"Salmonella typhi\" (causative agent of typhoid fever), and toxins—such as ricin and botulinum toxin.\n\nThe Rhodesian Security Forces called up part-time soldiers in preparation for a major counter-offensive on 2 May 1976. On 9 August 1976, Rhodesian Selous Scouts aided by former ZANLA commander Morrison Nyathi attacked a ZANLA camp at Nyadzonya in Mozambique containing over 5,000 guerrillas and several hundred refugees. The Selous Scouts, who numbered 72, dressed in FRELIMO uniforms and disguised their vehicles, attaching FRELIMO licence plates and painting them in FRELIMO colours. White soldiers wore black ski masks. They crossed the unmanned border into Mozambique at 0005 hours on 9 August and drove through the early morning to the camp, passing several FRELIMO sentries who saluted them as they went by.\n\nWhen they reached the ZANLA camp at 0825 hours the six ZANLA soldiers on duty allowed them to enter, and the Rhodesian vehicles moved in and took up prearranged positions around the edge of the parade ground, on which stood about 4,000 guerrillas. When all was ready a Rhodesian soldier took his vehicle loudspeaker and announced, in Shona, \"\"Zimbabwe tatora\"\", meaning \"we have taken Zimbabwe\", and Nyathi blew a whistle signalling the cadres to muster. The cadres began cheering and ran towards the vehicles, packing around them as more ran onto the parade ground from other areas of the camp.\n\nThe Rhodesians then opened fire and continued shooting until there was no movement on the parade ground, then they returned to Rhodesia. More than 300 ZANLA insurgents were reported killed by the Rhodesians, with four Selous Scouts lightly wounded. This figure is corroborated by ZANLA's official report, though publicly both ZANLA and ZIPRA claimed that Nyadzonya had been a refugee camp.\n\nLater, on 7 October 1976, militants bombed a railroad bridge over Matetsi River when a train carrying ore passed over.\n\n By 1977, the war had spread throughout Rhodesia. ZANLA continued to operate from Mozambique and remained dominant among the Mashona peoples in eastern and central Rhodesia. Meanwhile, ZIPRA remained active in the north and west, using bases in Zambia and Botswana, and were mainly supported by the Ndebele tribes. With this escalation came sophistication, organisation and modern weapons for the guerillas, and although many were still untrained, an increasing number were trained in Communist bloc and other sympathetic countries.\n\nOn 3 April 1977, General Peter Walls announced that the government would launch a campaign to win the \"hearts and minds\" of Rhodesia's black citizens. In May, Walls received reports of ZANLA forces massing in the city of Mapai in Gaza Province, Mozambique. Prime Minister Smith gave Walls permission to destroy the base. Walls told the media the Rhodesian forces were changing tactics from contain and hold to search and destroy, \"adopting hot pursuit when necessary.\"\n\nOn 30 May 1977, during Operation Aztec, 500 troops crossed the Mozambican border and travelled to Mapai, engaging the ZANLA forces with air cover from the Rhodesian Air Force and paratroopers in C-47 Dakotas. The Rhodesian government said the military killed 32 ZANLA fighters and lost one Rhodesian pilot. The Mozambican government disputed the number of casualties, saying it shot down three Rhodesian planes and a helicopter and took several troops prisoner, all of which was denied by Minister of Combined Operations, Roger Hawkins.\n\nKurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, condemned the incident on 1 June, and Walls announced a day later that the Rhodesian military would occupy Mapai until they had eliminated ZANLA's presence. But the American, British, and Soviet governments also condemned the raid and Rhodesian forces later withdrew from the area. The United Nations Security Council denounced the incursion of the \"illegal racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia\" in Resolution 411, on 30 June 1977.\n\nMilitants bombed a Woolworths department store in Salisbury on 6 August 1977, killing 11 and injuring 70. They killed 16 black civilians in eastern Rhodesia on 21 August, burning their homes on a white-owned farm. In November 1977, in response to the buildup of ZANLA guerrillas in Mozambique, Rhodesian forces launched Operation Dingo, a pre-emptive combined arms surprise attack on guerrilla camps at Chimoio and Tembue in Mozambique. The attack was carried out over three days, from 23 to 25 November 1977. While these operations reportedly inflicted thousands of casualties on Robert Mugabe's ZANLA cadres, probably blunting guerrilla incursions in the months that followed, nevertheless a steady intensification of the insurgency continued through 1978.\n\nTo disrupt FRELIMO's hold on Mozambique, the Rhodesian Central Intelligence Organisation helped to create and support an insurgency movement within Mozambique. This guerrilla group, known as RENAMO, battled with FRELIMO even as Rhodesian forces fought the ZANLA within Mozambique.\n\nIn May 1978, 50 civilians were killed in crossfire between Marxist militants and the Rhodesian military, the greatest number of civilians killed in an engagement until then. In July Patriotic Front members killed 39 black civilians and the Rhodesian government killed 106 militants. On 4 November 1978, Walls said 2,000 Patriotic Front militants had been persuaded to defect and fight for the Rhodesian Security Forces.\nIn December 1978, a ZANLA unit penetrated the outskirts of Salisbury and fired a volley of rockets and incendiary device rounds into the main oil storage depot. The storage tanks burned for five days, giving off a column of smoke that could be seen away. Half a million barrels of petroleum product—a quarter of Rhodesia's fuel—was destroyed.\nIn 1978, 450 ZANLA militants entered Mozambique and attacked the town of Umtali. At the time, ZANU said the militants were women, an unusual characteristic, but in 1996 Joyce Mujuru said the vast majority involved were men and ZANU concocted the story to make Western organisations believe women were involved in the fighting. In retaliation for these acts, the Rhodesian Air Force bombed guerrilla camps 125 miles inside Mozambique, using 'fatigued' Canberra B2 aircraft and Hawker Hunters – actively, but clandestinely, supported by several of the more capable Canberra B(I)12 aircraft of the South African Air Force. A number of joint-force bomber raids on guerrilla encampments and assembly areas in Mozambique and Zambia were mounted in 1978, and extensive air reconnaissance and surveillance of guerrilla encampments and logistical build-up was carried out by the South African Air Force on behalf of the RhAF.\n\nRhodesian external operations extended into Zambia after Nkomo's ZIPRA nationalists shot down two unarmed Vickers Viscount civilian airliners with Soviet-supplied SA-7 heat-seeking missiles. Encamped beneath the path of ascent towards Salisbury from Kariba Airport, the ZIPRA cadres downed Air Rhodesia Flight 825 on 3 September 1978 and Air Rhodesia Flight 827 on 12 February 1979. In the first incident, eighteen civilians on board survived, and five of these went away to find water. Half an hour later nine ZIPRA fighters arrived, promising help; three of the thirteen survivors hid when they saw them. In the words of \"Time\" magazine, the ZIPRA cadres \"herded together the ten people at the wreckage, robbed them of their valuables, and finally cut them down with automatic weapons fire\". Nkomo claimed responsibility for the attack and spoke of it to the BBC in a way Rhodesians considered gloating. In the second attack all 59 people on board were killed in the crash.\n\nIn retaliation for the shooting down of Flight 825 in September 1978, Rhodesian Air Force Canberra bombers, Hunter fighter-bombers and helicopter gunships attacked the ZIPRA guerrilla base at Westlands farm near Lusaka in October 1978, warning Zambian forces by radio not to interfere.\n\nThe increased effectiveness of the bombing and follow-up 'air mobile' strikes using Dakota-dropped parachutists and helicopter 'air cav' techniques had a significant effect on the development of the conflict. As late as September 1979, despite the increased sophistication of guerrilla forces in Mozambique, a raid by Selous Scouts, with artillery and air support, on \"New Chimoio\" still reportedly resulted in heavy ZANLA casualties. However, a successful raid on the Rhodesian strategic fuel reserves in Salisbury also underscored the importance of concluding a negotiated settlement and achieving international recognition before the war expanded further.\n\nThe larger problem was that by 1979, combined ZIPRA and ZANLA strength inside Rhodesia totalled at least 12,500 guerrillas and it was evident that insurgents were entering the country at a faster rate than the Rhodesian forces could kill or capture. In addition, 22,000 ZIPRA and 16,000 ZANLA fighters remained uncommitted outside the country. Joshua Nkomo's ZIPRA forces were preparing their forces in Zambia with the intent of confronting the Rhodesians through a conventional invasion. Whether such an invasion could have been successful in the short term against the well trained Rhodesian army and air force is questionable. However, what was clear was that the insurgency was growing in strength daily and the ability of the security forces to continue to control the entire country was coming under serious challenge.\n\nBy putting the civilian population at risk, ZIPRA and the ZANLA had been particularly effective in creating conditions that accelerated white emigration. This not only seriously undermined the morale of the white population, it was also gradually reducing the availability of trained reserves for the army and the police. For a discussion see: The economy was also suffering badly from the war; the Rhodesian GDP consistently declined in the late 1970s. \n\nPolitically, the Rhodesians were therefore pinning all their hopes on the \"internal\" political settlement that had been negotiated with moderate black nationalist leaders in 1978 and its ability to achieve external recognition and support. This internal settlement led to the creation of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia under a new constitution in 1979.\n\nUnder the agreement of March 1978, the country was renamed Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, and in the general election of 24 April 1979, Bishop Abel Muzorewa became the country's first black prime minister. On 1 June 1979, Josiah Zion Gumede became President. The internal settlement left control of the military, police, civil service, and judiciary in white hands, and assured whites about one-third of the seats in parliament. It was essentially a power-sharing arrangement between whites and blacks. The factions led by Nkomo and Mugabe denounced the new government as a puppet of white Rhodesians and fighting continued. The hoped for recognition of the internal settlement, and of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, by the newly elected Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher did not materialise after the latter's election in May 1979. Likewise, although the US Senate voted to lift sanctions against Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, the Carter administration also refused to recognise the internal settlement.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Thatcher clearly sympathized with the internal settlement and thought of the ZANLA and ZIPRA leaders as terrorists, she was prepared to support a push for further compromise if it could end the fighting. Britain was also reluctant to recognise the internal settlement for fear of fracturing the unity of the Commonwealth. Thus later in 1979, the Thatcher government called a peace conference in London to which all nationalist leaders were invited.\n\nThe outcome of this conference would become known as the Lancaster House Agreement. During the conference, the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian Government accepted a watering down of the 1978 internal settlement while Mugabe and Nkomo agreed to end the war in exchange for new elections in which they could participate. The economic sanctions imposed on Rhodesia were lifted in late 1979, and the country reverted to temporary British rule until elections could be held. Under the Constitution of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia (Amendment) (No. 4) Act 1979 of 11 December 1979, the country formally reverted to its colonial status as Southern Rhodesia. The Zimbabwe-Rhodesian parliament voted itself out of power, and Lord Soames was appointed by the British government to rule the country as Governor-Designate, arriving in Salisbury on 12 December to take over from President Gumede. On 21 December 1979, a cease-fire was announced. An election was scheduled for early 1980. The British Commonwealth deployed an observer force, the Commonwealth Monitoring Force, to the country for the transitional period. Britain contributed 800 soldiers and 300 Royal Air Force personnel, along with small naval and marine contingents. Australia, Fiji, Kenya, and New Zealand also contributed smaller numbers of troops. A nine-man British advance party arrived on 8 December to begin establishing a logistics base, and this was followed by the arrival of the main force shortly after.\n\nThe war would end in a military stalemate. However, the political compromise which was reached after combat ceased would work to the advantage of the black nationalists, especially those aligned with ZANU leader Robert Mugabe. Mugabe himself stated in an interview published in the 28 April 1980 edition of the New York Times \"We did not win a military victory... We reached a political settlement... A compromise.\"\n\nDuring the election of 1980, there were accusations of voter intimidation by Mugabe's guerrilla cadres, sections of which were accused of not having assembled in the designated guerrilla assembly points as required under the Lancaster House Agreement, and the international observers as well as Lord Soames were accused of looking the other way. The Rhodesian military may have seriously considered a coup d'état in March 1980. This alleged coup was to consist of two stages: Operation Quartz, coordinated attacks on guerrilla assembly points within the country, and Operation Hectic, the assassination of Mugabe and his key aides.\n\nHowever, even in the context of alleged voter intimidation by ZANLA elements, widespread support for Mugabe from large sections of the black population (in particular from the Shona language group which made up the overwhelming majority of the country's population) could not be seriously disputed. Moreover, the clear absence of any external support for such a coup, and the inevitable conflagration that would have engulfed the country thereafter, scuttled the plan.\n\nThe election of early 1980 was won by Mugabe, who became prime minister after ZANU-PF received 63% of the vote. By 16 March 1980, all Commonwealth forces had departed, save for 40 infantry instructors who temporarily stayed behind to train the new nation's army. On 18 April 1980, interim British rule ended and the country was internationally recognised as independent. The colony of Southern Rhodesia was formally renamed Zimbabwe, and on 18 April 1982, the government changed the name of the country's capital from Salisbury to Harare.\n\nAccording to Rhodesian government statistics, more than 20,000 were killed during the war. From December 1972 to December 1979, 4,360 members of the Rhodesian security forces were killed, along with 10,050 guerrillas who were killed in Rhodesia, and an unknown number in Mozambique and Zambia, 7,790 black civilians, and 468 white civilians.\n\nAfter he assumed power, Robert Mugabe acted incrementally to consolidate his power, forming a coalition government with his ZAPU rivals and the white minority. The Rhodesian Army was merged with guerrilla forces to form the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, and the Rhodesian security forces were merged with ZANLA and ZIPRA forces. Joshua Nkomo was given a series of cabinet positions.\n\nHowever, Mugabe was torn between keeping his coalition stable and pressures to meet the expectations of his followers for social change. Clashes between ZANLA and ZIPRA forces took place in 1980 and 1981. In February 1982, Mugabe fired Nkomo and two other ZAPU ministers from his cabinet, triggering bitter fighting between ZAPU supporters in Ndebele-speaking region of the country and the ruling ZANU. Between 1982 and 1985, the military crushed armed resistance from Ndebele groups in Matabeleland and the Midlands in a military crackdown known as \"Gukurahundi\", a Shona term which translates roughly to mean \"the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains\". The \"Gukurahundi\" campaigns were also known as the Matabeleland Massacres.\n\nThe Zimbabwean military's North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade was deployed to Matabeleland to crush resistance. German journalist Shari Eppel estimates approximately 20,000 Matabele were murdered in these first years after the war; most of those killed were victims of public executions.\n\nViolence between ZANLA and ZIPRA continued until 1987. In December 1987, the two groups reached an accord which saw them merge into one party known as ZANU PF, headed by Mugabe. Mugabe then became President and gained additional powers, as the office of Prime Minister was abolished.\n\nBeyond Zimbabwe's borders, as a result of Rhodesian aid and support for RENAMO, the Rhodesian Bush War also helped influence the outbreak of the Mozambique Civil War, which lasted from 1977 until 1992. That conflict claimed over a million lives, and made some five million people homeless.\n\nA number of books and films are set during the Bush War.\n\nFilms include:\n\nBooks include:\n\n\n"}

It is in two sections, the southern section running from north Belfast to Antrim and the northern section acts as a bypass of Ballymena, with the A26 road linking the two sections. In total it is 22 miles (36.2 kilometres). The M2 has the busiest sections of any road or motorway in Northern Ireland. The M2 is one of Northern Ireland's most important motorways, forming most of the main route from Belfast city to both Belfast International Airport and less than a quarter of the way to Derry. It forms part of the unsigned European route E01, E16 and E18 roads.\n\nThe route starts at as a continuation of the M3 to the west of the River Lagan at Duncairn. It strikes north past the docks and to the east of Fortwilliam before turning west on slip roads at Junction 2. It now runs through the northern suburbs of Belfast past Whitewell and enters the \"hill section\" as it climbs at a gradient of up to 1 in 15, one of the steepest in the United Kingdom. It then passes south of Glengormley before leaving the city behind at Ballyvesy. Entering the countryside, it runs parallel to Ballymartin Water before reaching Junction 5 north of Templepatrick, then crosses Six Mile Water before arriving to the north of Burnside at Junction 6. Running around the north of Antrim, shortly after Junction 7 the road meets an incomplete junction where the motorway would have continued to Ballymena. When the road widens, it becomes the M22.\n\nThe route begins to the south east of Ballymena at Ballycregy as a continuation of the A26 and heads north under the roundabout at junction 10. Running east of Crebilly it crosses the River Braid and turns more north west to the west of Rabbit Hill passes south of Killyflugh, passes east of Leymore and terminates on the A26 by Teeshan. The unbuilt Junction 8 was for Kells and Connor and Junction 9 for a future Ballymena southern bypass.\n\nA route roughly along the line of the M2 had been planned since the 1930s, but the first concrete plans for the \"North Approach\" were announced in 1946. In 1956 proposals for several motorways, including the M2, were announced with the M2 running directly to Ballymena. Part of this alignment became the A8(M). In 1964 the plans were further extended to route the M2 via Antrim to Coleraine, away from its original direct alignment over difficult terrain, which is how the plans for construction were then progressed. The A8(M) was already under construction, so it was left as a spur.\n\nDue to financial restraints, it was decided to prioritise the sections of the road required urgently, with the first stage being started on 2 September 1963. Construction continued until 1975, with the road being opened in the following sections:\n\nIn 1993 Junction 7 was opened to provide access to Antrim Area Hospital.\n\nThe section between Junctions 7 and 10 was to be the next section constructed, but with the onset of The Troubles and then direct rule, nearly all the planned motorway projects were cancelled. The A26 between M22 Junction 1 and Junction 10 of the M2 was progressively upgraded to a dual carriageway and so it is now unlikely that the M2 will ever be completed.\n\nThe section between Junctions 1A and 2 is ten lanes (five lanes and two full-width shoulders each way) and, when it was opened, was the widest motorway in the United Kingdom.\n\n\nPetrogas opened a Motorway service area in April 2015 off the northbound carriageway between the Glengormley and Templepatrick junctions. Branded \"Applegreen\" the service area contains food franchises including Burger King. A second service area is under construction off the southbound carriageway\n\n\n"}

It is about from Earth, yet can still be seen by the naked eye as it is 500,000 times brighter than the Sun. On average it has an absolute magnitude of −9.5, making it visually one of the most luminous stars known. Its diameter measures between 400 and 500 times that of the Sun, approximately 627,000,000 kilometers, or about twice the size of the Earth's orbit.\n\nRho Cassiopeiae is a single star, and is categorized as a semiregular variable. As a yellow hypergiant, it is one of the rarest types of stars. Only around a dozen are known in the Milky Way, but it is not the only one in its constellation which also contains V509 Cassiopeiae.\n\nThe Bayer designation for this star was established in 1603 as part of the \"Uranometria\", a star catalog produced by Johann Bayer. The star catalog by John Flamsteed published in 1712, which orders the stars in each constellation by their right ascension, gave this star the Flamsteed designation 7 Cassiopeiae.\n\nRho Cas was first described as variable in 1901. It was classified only as \"pec.\" with a small but definite range of variation. Its nature continued to be unclear during the deep visual minimum in 1946, although it was presumed to be related to the detection of an expanding shell around the star. The spectrum developed lower excitation features described as typical of an M star rather than the previous F8 class. The nature of Rho Cas was eventually clarified as a massive luminous unstable star, pulsating and losing mass, and occasionally becoming obscured by strong bouts of mass loss.\n\nRho Cas usually has an apparent magnitude near 4.5, but in 1946 it unexpectedly dimmed to 6th magnitude and cooled by over 3,000 Kelvin, before returning to its previous brightness. A similar eruption was recorded in 1893, suggesting that it undergoes these eruptions approximately once every 50 years. This happened again in 2000–2001, when it was observed by the William Herschel Telescope.\n\nIn 2013, a shell ejection produced dramatic spectral changes and a drop of about half a magnitude at visual wavelengths. Weak emission lines of metals and doubled H-α absorption lines were detected in late 2014, and unusual tripled absorption lines in 2017. The brightness peaked at magnitude 4.3 before fading to 5th magnitude. In 2018 it brightened again to magnitude 4.2.\n\nThe original Hipparcos parallax publication estimated Rho Cas at around 0.28 mas, which would have corresponded to a distance around 10,000 light years and would have made Rho Cas among the farthest stars visible to the naked eye. However, more recent publications estimate Rho Cas with a much larger parallax, corresponding to a much shorter distance.\n\nRho Cassiopeiae is one of the most luminous yellow stars known. It is close to the Eddington luminosity limit and normally loses mass at around /yr, hundreds of millions of times the rate of the solar wind. Much of the time it has a temperature over 7,000 K, a radius around , and pulsates irregularly producing small changes in brightness. Approximately every 50 years it undergoes a larger outburst and blows off a substantial fraction of its atmosphere, causing the temperature to drop around 1,500 K and the brightness to drop by up to 1.5 magnitudes. In 2000–2001 the mass loss rate jumped to /yr, ejecting in total approximately 3% of a solar mass or 10,000 Earth masses. The luminosity remains roughly constant during the outbursts at , but the radiation output shifts towards the infra red.\n\nSurface abundances of most heavy elements on Rho Cas are enhanced relative to the Sun, but carbon and oxygen are depleted. This is expected for a massive star where hydrogen fusion takes place predominantly via the CNO cycle. In addition to the expected helium and nitrogen convected to the surface, sodium is strongly enhanced, indicating that the star had experienced a dredge-up while in a red supergiant stage. Therefore, it is expected that Rho Cas is now evolving towards hotter temperatures. It is currently core helium burning through the triple alpha process.\n\nThe relatively low mass and high luminosity of a post-red supergiant star is a source of instability, pushing it close to the Eddington Limit. However, yellow hypergiants lie in a temperature range where opacity variations in zones of partial ionisation of hydrogen and helium cause pulsations, similar to the cause of Cepheid variable pulsations. In hypergiants, these pulsations are generally irregular and small, but combined with the overall instability of the outer layers of the star they can result in larger outbursts. This may all be part of an evolutionary trend towards hotter temperatures through the loss of the star's atmosphere.\n\nρ Cassiopeiae is a member of the Chinese constellation \"Flying Serpent\" (), in the Encampment mansion. In order, the 22 member stars are α and 4 Lacertae, π and π Cygni, stars 5 and 6, HD 206267, 13 and ε Cephei, β Lacertae, σ, ρ, τ, and AR Cassiopeiae, 9 Lacertae, 3, 7, 8, λ, ψ, κ, and ι Andromedae. Consequently, the Chinese name for ρ Cassiopeiae is (, )\n\n"}

This was one major factor in Japan's ability to quickly exploit raw materials in the areas of the Empire of Japan that had recently come under their military control.\n\nNippon Lurgi Goshi KK was a Japanese company of the period involved in Japanese-German cooperation. The Lurgi AG German industrial group was a partner, and it was the Lurgi office in Tokyo. The Combined Intelligence Objectives Sub-committee of the United States and United Kingdom later investigated it.\n\nAt the beginning of 1942 the Japanese acquired all the low temperature carbonization patents of Lurgi for Japan, Manchuria, and of China. The agreement gave the Japanese the right to construct plants and an exclusive use of patents. A flat payment of approximately 800,000 Reichsmark, was received from the Japanese, this sum being cleared through the German government. One of the aims was synthetic oil. For example, the South Sakhalin Mining and Railway Company plant at Naihoro/Oichai in Karafuto perhaps motivated the licensing: the southern Karafuto brown coal with a content of paraffin tar (about 15%), and low water content, was suitable for hydrogenation.\n\n\nUbe Yuka Kogya KK (No.2), at Ube was a low temperature carbonization plant, with a synthetic ammonia plant. This was a collaboration with Heinrich Koppers AG of Essen.\n\nIt is known that Japan and Germany signed agreements on military technological collaboration, both before the 1939 outbreak of World War II, and during the conflict. However, the first air technology interchange occurred during World War I when Japan joined against Germany on the side of the Allies, and Germany lost a Rumpler Taube aircraft at Tsingtao, which the Japanese rebuilt as the Isobe Kaizo Rumpler Taube, as well as an LVG, known to the Japanese as the Seishiki-1, in 1916.\n\nAfter the war had ended the Japanese purchased licences for the Hansa-Brandenburg W.33 which was built as the Yokosho Navy Type Hansa in 1922, and as the Aichi Type 15-ko \"Mi-go\" in 1925.\n\nDuring World War II the Japanese Navy traded a Nakajima E8N \"Dave\" reconnaissance seaplane (itself a multi-generational development of the Vought O2U to Germany, later seen in British markings on the German raider , and some sources mention the probable dispatch of a Mitsubishi Ki-46 \"Dinah\", among other weapons.\n\nIn the other direction:\n\n\nWhen it came to aircraft equipment, the Japanese Army fighter Kawasaki Ki-61 \"Hien\" (\"Tony\") used a licence-built Daimler-Benz DB 601A engine which resulted in the Allies believing that it was either a Messerschmitt Bf 109 or an Italian Macchi C.202 \"Folgore\" until they examined captured examples. It was also fitted with Mauser MG 151/20 20 mm cannons also built under licence.\n\nAccording to decrypted messages from the Japanese embassy in Germany, twelve dismantled V-2 (A-4) rockets were shipped to Japan. These left Bordeaux in August 1944 on the and and reached Djakarta in December 1944. Civilian V-2 expert Heinz Schlicke was a passenger on the when it departed Kristiansand, Norway for Japan in May 1945, shortly before the war ended in Europe. The fate of these V-2 rockets is unknown.\n\nThere are other cases of military technology interchange. The Ho-Ru SPG with 47 mm AT cannon, resembled the German \"Hetzer\" tank destroyer combined with wheel guide pins like the T-34. The heavy tank destroyers Ho-Ri I and II, armed with a 105 mm cannon, seem to have been influenced by German \"Jagd\" heavy tanks \"Elefant\" and \"Jagdtiger\". The Type 4 Chi-To medium tank, armed with a 75 mm cannon, and the Type 5 Chi-Ri medium tank, armed with 75 or 88 mm cannon, were influenced by the Panther, Tiger I, and Tiger II German tanks. The Type 1 Ho-Ha half-track armoured personnel carrier was similar to the German Sd.Kfz. 251 armoured fighting vehicle.\n\nJapanese Ambassador General Hiroshi Ōshima in the name of Japanese Army bought one example of the Panzerkampfwagen PzKpfw VI Ausf E Tiger I tank with additional equipment.\n\nThe Japanese Navy received examples of the German Type IXD2 submarine Ausf \"Monsun\" and other submarines, such as the Type IXD2's (Japanese submarine \"I-501\") and (\"I-502\"), the (\"I-503\"), and \"Reginaldo Giuliani\" (\"I-504\"), the German Type X submarine (\"I-505\"), the Type IXD1 (\"I-506\"), two Type IXC submarines (\"RO-500\" & \"RO-501\"), and Flakvierling anti-aircraft cannons, with a disarmed V-2, etc.\n\nJapanese Navy received later in last war stages from Germans, some advanced technology of Type XXI \"Elektro-boote\" class for designed The Sen Taka (submarine, high speed) and Sen Taka Sho (submarine, high speed, small) models, in high bursts of speed, could run faster submerged than on the surface for up to an hour, only comparable in underwater speed to the \"I-201\"-class was the German related sub type.\n\nIn 1935, a German technical mission arrived in Japan to sign accords and licenses to use the technology from the for use in the German aircraft carriers and \"Flugzeugträger B\" (both later cancelled) from Deutsche Werke Kiel A.G.\n\nThey also acquired the technical data on the adaptations to the Messerschmitt Bf 109T/E and Junkers Ju 87C/E, for use on such carriers. This technology was also applied in the following aircraft:\n\nTo put this in perspective, the Japanese also bought licences and acquired aircraft (sometimes singly and sometimes in large quantities) from most of the western countries. These included the United Kingdom (with which it had a close relationship up until shortly after the end of World War I) and whose De Havilland aircraft were extensively used, France, who supplied a huge variety of aircraft of all types from 1917 through to the 1930s, and whose Nieuport-Delage NiD 29 fighter provided the Japanese Army Air Force with its first modern fighter aircraft, as well as the bias toward extremely manoeuvrable aircraft. The United States of America supplied the Douglas DC-4E and Douglas DC-5, the North American NA-16 (precursor to the T-6/SNJ) as well as others too many to list. This resulted in many Japanese aircraft being discounted as being copies of Western designs - which from 1935 onwards was rarely the case except for trainers and light transports where development could be accelerated, the Nakajima Ki-201 and Mitsubishi J8M being rare exceptions.\n\nBy 1944, Japan was to rely heavily on the Nippon-German Technical Exchange Agreement, obtaining manufacturing rights, intelligence, blueprints, and in some cases, actual airframes for several of Germany's new air weapons. These included the Me 163 \"Komet\" (developed as the Mitsubishi J8M \"Shusui\"), the BMW 003 axial-flow jet engine (which was reworked to Japanese standards as the Ishikawajima Ne-20), information on the Me 262 which resulted in the Nakajima J9Y \"Kikka\"), data on the Fiesler Fi-103R series (which culminated in the development of the Kawanishi Baika), and even data on the Bachem Ba 349 \"Natter\" point-defense interceptor.\n\nWhile the Nakajima \"Kikka\" bore some resemblance to the German Me 262, it was only superficial, even though the Ne-20 engines which powered the \"Kikka\" were the Japanese equivalent of the German BMW 003 engine which initially powered the Me 262 prototype. Also, the \"Kikka\" was envisioned from the outset not as a fighter, but as a special attack bomber and was only armed with a bomb payload. It is wrongly considered that this aircraft registration was J9Y or J10N, although this aircraft was never registered.\n\n\n"}

Inspired by a visit to Hungary, the album title and all of the track names are in Hungarian; \"Rossz Csillag Alatt Született\" translates to \"Born Under the Wrong Star \", a Hungarian expression which means \"cursed from birth\". Stylistically, the album consists of classical strings and brass combined with breakbeats.\n\nThe concept of the album came when Aaron Funk imagined himself as a pigeon on Budapest's Királyi Palota (Royal Palace). Its third track, \"Öngyilkos Vasárnap\" is a cover of the song \"Szomorú Vasárnap\" (\"Gloomy Sunday\") by Hungarian composer Rezső Seress, which has been referred to as the Hungarian suicide song. According to urban legend, Seress's song has inspired the suicide of multiple people, including his fiancée. The song was reportedly banned in Hungary. It has also been covered by many artists. Billie Holiday's vocals are sampled in this track.\n\nThe album also samples various pieces of classical music:\n\nWhile there were no official music videos released with the album, artist David O'Reilly produced an unofficial computer generated video for \"Szamár Madár\".\n\nAlan Ranta of \"Tiny Mix Tapes\" praised \"Rossz Csillag Alatt Született\" as Funk's \"most accomplished album to date\" and described it as being \"of uncouth beauty that is at once sublime, timeless, cinematic, sporadic, and moving from start to finish.\" Sputnikmusic writer Nick Greer hailed it as an \"absolutely amazing\" release that \"truly excels in how it shifts paradigms in unexpected ways\". William Tilland of AllMusic called the album \"typically uncompromising and unsettling, although it is certainly constructed with great technical skill and maintains an abrasive beauty throughout.\" Cameron MacDonald of \"Pitchfork\" was more reserved in his praise and felt that \"Funk's percussive palate could have ventured beyond the standard-issued 'Amen' breakbeats\", while concluding that \"\"Rossz\"s totality still possesses nerves that can cast shadows that never dissipate away from the mind.\"\n\n\"Tiny Mix Tapes\" ranked \"Rossz Csillag Alatt Született\" the 25th best album of 2005 and the 31st best album of the 2000s. In 2014, \"Resident Advisor\" critic Hugh Taylor described it as \"one of breakcore's most important albums\".
