This theory has its basis in source criticism. Since the commentary of Rudolf Bultmann was published in 1941, the hypothesis of a \"semeia\" (sign or miracle) source has gained some acceptance.\n\nOne possible construction of the \"internal evidence\" states that the Beloved Disciple wrote an account of the life of Jesus. However, this disciple died unexpectedly, necessitating that a revised gospel be written. In other words, it may be that John “is the source\" of the Johannine tradition but \"not the final writer of the tradition.\"\n\nThe hypothesis of the \"Gospel of John\" being composed in layers over a period of time originated in the work of Rudolf Bultmann in 1941. Bultmann suggested that the author(s) of John depended in part on an author who wrote an earlier account. This hypothetical \"Signs Gospel\" listing Christ's miracles was independent of, and not used by, the synoptic gospels. It was believed to have been circulating before the year 70 AD. Bultmann's conclusion was so controversial that heresy proceedings were instituted against him and his writings.\n\nNevertheless, this hypothesis has not disappeared. Scholars such as Raymond E. Brown believe the original author of the \"Signs Gospel\" to be the Beloved Disciple. They argue that the disciple who formed this community was both a historical person and a companion of Jesus Christ. Brown also suggests that the Beloved Disciple had been a follower of John the Baptist before joining Jesus.\n\nIt is now widely agreed that the Gospel of John draws upon a tradition of Miracles of Jesus which is substantially independent of the three synoptic gospels.\n\nRobert Fortna, a member of the Jesus Seminar, argued that there are at least two distinct writing styles contained in the \"Gospel of John\". The later style contains highly developed and sophisticated midrash and theological essays attached superficially - even \"mechanically\" at some points - to the former source. The other - earlier - style is the original 2-part Signs Gospel, consisting of a \"Signs Source\" (SQ) and a \"Passion Source\" (PQ). It is simple, direct and historical in style and can be roughly reconstructed as follows:\n\n\n"}

It consists of only one ship, DD-167 \"Shenzhen\". When \"Shenzhen\" was commissioned into the People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force in 1998, it was then, the largest surface combatant that China had ever built. It resembles in many ways an enlarged version of the , and is one of the first PLAN ships with a slope-sided hull to reduce radar signature. The 051B was succeeded by the domestic Type 052B, discounting the 4 Soviet built Sovremennyy-class destroyer China purchased in the interim.\n\n\"Shenzhen\" was laid down by the Dalian Shipyard in May 1996. The \"Shenzhen\" was intended to be an experimental vessel with improvements over the \"Luhu\"-class' in terms of modular construction and stealth. The ship is powered by two indigenous steam turbine engines, due to Dalian Shipyard's experience in steam turbine construction and that Chinese domestic research and development on marine gas turbines had not yet matured. The displacement of the \"Luhai\"-class is 2,000 tons heavier than the Type 052 destroyer, \"Luhu\"-class. Shenzhen was launched in 1997, although official revelation of the ship's existence did not come until the year following its commissioning. The chief designer of this class is academic, Mr. Pan Jingfu (潘镜芙), who is also the designer of both the Type 051B's predecessor and successor.\n\nThe main purpose of the Type 051B was to gain experience in modern naval ship design and construction, and refining the knowledge and skills accumulated from the earlier Type 052, such as integrating many different foreign subsystems on the Type 052 more effectively. The ship is powered by steam turbines due to the 1989 western arms embargo and that domestic gas turbines were not ready in time. The Type 051B also employed stealth construction techniques which resulted in a smaller radar cross section in comparison to its predecessor. Analysts speculated that the ship would have been equipped with an VLS system in the forward section for air-defense SAMs. However, when the ship was finally revealed, it was still armed with the 8-cell HQ-7 SAM launcher. These SAMs lack effectiveness against sea skimming missiles with multiple approaching angles. The PLAN was unsatisfied with the design and no further ships of the class were built. At the time, area air defence for the fleet was the PLAN's priority which older systems couldn't sufficiently provide, and since the capability couldn't be served by the final vessel the gap remained open. As a result, the decision to import two pairs of Sovremennyy-class destroyer from Russia was determined to fulfil the role. However, Type 051B does have an advantage over earlier Chinese principle surface combatants and Russian ships in that it is the first Chinese naval ship to be equipped with fleet formation command and control system so it can act as a flagship of the fleet.\n\nThe sole Type 051B destroyer 167 \"Shenzhen\" participated in the PLA Navy's first goodwill visit to Africa in 2000, the first visit to Europe in 2001 and the first visit to Japan in 2007. In 2004, the ship received its mid-life modernization refit, with its original 100mm main gun and the HQ-7 air defense missile system being replaced by improved models.\n\nType 051B destroyer 167 \"Shenzhen\" visited Kochi, India for four days in August 2009, after deployment in the Gulf of Aden on anti-piracy operations.\n\nIn early 2015, the sole Type 051B destroyer was spotted at the Zhanjiang naval base undergoing work. Initially it was unclear whether this was due to a midlife refit program or decommissioning, but pictures revealed in January 2016 that the ship was being refitted with new systems. For self-defense, the four old Type 76A 37 mm AA guns were replaced with two H/PJ-11 eleven-barreled 30 mm CIWS (export designation Type 1130), one covering each side. \n\nAnti-aircraft defense is upgraded from the 8-unit HQ-7 with a range to a 32-cell vertical launch system (VLS) in front of the superstructure for -ranged HQ-16s, directed by four Type 345 (Front-Dome type) illuminators, increasing SAM coverage by 16 times. The helicopter hangar was modified to carry a single Ka-28 ASW helicopter in place of the original dual Z-9 hangar, and two new mast structures were fitted; a Type 382 Radar on the forward mast and a Type 364 targeting radar (under dome) on the aft mast. The upgrades give the Type 051B weapon and sensor capabilities similar to the Type 054A frigate. The Type 382 replaced the Type 381 singe-faced phased-array radar, and moved from the aft to the forward mast to remove the blind arc it previously exhibited, the quarterdeck was fully enclosed, and new apertures were added in the transom indicating that torpedo decoy and towed array sonar systems have been added; a variable depth sonar has not been installed. The ship completed the weapon systems upgrade in August 2016.\n\nIn May 2020, it was revealed that the Type 051B had its YJ-83 subsonic ASMs replaced with 16 supersonic YJ-12 missiles.\n\n\n"}

In addition to his numerous positions as a public official and child advocate in the non-profit sector, he served 16 years on the board of directors for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, based in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nSteiner earned his bachelor's degree in criminology from the University of California, Berkeley, and his master's degree in social work from the University of Southern California.\n\nWhile still in his twenties, Steiner founded and became the director of the Good Samaritan Boy's home, which expanded over the years to include a number of group homes across California.\n\nIn 1985, the Orangewood Children's Home, a public-private partnership, opened its doors to serve as Orange County's transitional shelter for children, after Steiner led efforts to raise $8.5 million for the facility. Steiner served as executive director of the Orangewood Foundation, which over the years has raised over $20 million to address problems of child abuse and neglect in Orange County.\n\nCalifornia Governor George Deukmejian appointed Steiner to the State Child Development Programs Advisory Committee in 1986, and from 1990 to 1998 he served as a policy advisor to the Cabinet Secretary for Child Development and Education in the Administration of Governor Pete Wilson. He has taught Political Science at the University of California, Irvine, Public Policy at the University of Southern California, and child abuse courses at Chapman University. Steiner has also worked with the California Youth Authority, the Los Angeles Department of Adoptions, Metropolitan State Hospital, and various residential treatment agencies serving abused and neglected children.\n\nSteiner served as a delegate from the United States to Poland, Czechoslovakia and the former Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nIn 1993, Steiner was appointed to the Orange County Board of Supervisors, by Governor Pete Wilson, to serve out the term of incumbent Don Roth, ousted by a scandal involving a criminal probe into gifts accepted from local real-estate developers and corporate lobbyists. Steiner was subsequently elected to a four-year term the next year, through January, 1999, serving as Chairman of the Board for 1997. During his tenure, Steiner helped lead the county back from financial disaster after it filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy on December 6, 1994, due to a $1.64-billion collapse in the value of the county's investment portfolio. The bankruptcy was precipitated by investment decisions made largely by county staff prior to Steiner's tenure on the board. In its wake, Steiner survived an aborted recall effort.\n\nAt the end of his elected term on the Orange County board of supervisors, in 1999, Steiner moved to Scottsdale, Arizona for four years to become the national program director for Childhelp USA, serving there until 2003. While in Arizona, Steiner oversaw the conversion of Merv Griffin's 192 acre (0.7 km²) Wickenberg Inn & Dude Ranch, located in Wickenburg, into the Merv Griffin Village of Arizona, a treatment center for abused kids.\n\nAlso in 1999, Steiner joined with Florida based partners, Bill Hebrock and Daryl McLaughlin, to form Hebrock Steiner McLaughlin, Inc., a public policy consulting and lobbying firm. Steiner has been involved in business and cultural exchanges with the People's Republic of China, and travels there frequently to develop public/private partnerships for the firm's clients.\n\nHe is also an investor in, and vice chairman of, Zhao International, Inc., an international exporting company which exports scrap metal to Tianjin, China, a 'sister city' of Orange.\n\nSteiner has served on the Juvenile Justice Commission for several years, having been appointed by the presiding judge of the Superior Court.\n\nSteiner is the father of five children, including Orange County judge Scott Steiner, and grandfather of sixteen.\n\nSteiner has been named Child Advocate of the Year by the California Court Appointed Advocates, and Citizen of the Year by the City of Orange.

About 85 percent of the refuge's is freshwater wetlands.\n\nThe original Concord, Massachusetts parcel that was the beginning nucleus of the sanctuary, has been known as the \"Great Meadows\" since the 17th century.\nThe parcel was donated to the U.S. Government by Concord resident Samuel Hoar in 1944.\nHoar purchased a part of the Meadows in 1928, and built earthen dams (dikes) to hold the water within the marshlands, enhancing their value as waterfowl habitat for hunting. To provide greater protection for the area’s wetlands and wildlife, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began buying additional land during the 1960s.\n\nA great diversity of birds have been recorded at the refuge, including nesting waterfowl: mallards, black ducks, wood ducks, and blue-winged teal.

However, a central force is conservative if and only if it is spherically symmetric.\n\nCentral forces that are conservative can always be expressed as the negative gradient of a potential energy:-\n(the upper bound of integration is arbitrary, as the potential is defined up to an additive constant).\n\nIn a conservative field, the total mechanical energy (kinetic and potential) is conserved:\n(where ṙ denotes the derivative of r with respect to time, that is the velocity), and in a central force field, so is the angular momentum:\nbecause the torque exerted by the force is zero. As a consequence, the body moves on the plane perpendicular to the angular momentum vector and containing the origin, and obeys Kepler's second law. (If the angular momentum is zero, the body moves along the line joining it with the origin.)\n\nIt can also be shown that an object that moves under the influence of \"any\" central force obeys Kepler's second law. However, the first and third laws depend on the inverse-square nature of Newton's law of universal gravitation and do not hold in general for other central forces.\n\nAs a consequence of being conservative, these specific central force fields are irrotational, that is, its curl is zero, \"except at the origin\":\n\nGravitational force and Coulomb force are two familiar examples with formula_8 being proportional to 1/\"r\" only. An object in such a force field with negative formula_8 (corresponding to an attractive force) obeys Kepler's laws of planetary motion.\n\nThe force field of a spatial harmonic oscillator is central with formula_8 proportional to \"r\" only and negative.\n\nBy Bertrand's theorem, these two, formula_11and \"formula_12\", are the only possible central force fields where all bounded orbits are stable closed orbits. However, there exist other force fields, which have some closed orbits.\n\nThis article uses the definition of central force given in Taylor. Another common definition (used in \"ScienceWorld\") adds the constraint that the force be spherically symmetric, i.e. formula_13.\n\n"}

Initially associated with the Peronist right, the organisation opposed the Peronist left and other leftist organizations. The AAA acted against a wide range of government opponents, not just communists.\n\nThe Triple A allegedly was secretly led by José López Rega, Minister of Social Welfare and personal secretary of Juan Perón. Rodolfo Almirón, arrested in Spain in 2006, was alleged to be his chief operating officer of the group, and was officially head of López Rega's and Isabel Perón's personal security. He was extradited from Spain in 2006 and prosecuted; he died in jail in June 2009. SIDE agent Anibal Gordon was another important member of the Triple A, although he always denied it. He was tried in Argentina in 1985 after the restoration of democracy and convicted in October 1986. Gordon died in prison of lung cancer the next year.\n\nIn 2006, Argentine Judge Norberto Oyarbide ruled the Triple A had committed \"crimes against humanity,\" which meant their crimes were exempt from statutes of limitations. Suspects can be prosecuted for actions committed in the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe \"Triple A\" was believed to have been organized in 1973 by José López Rega and Alberto Villar, deputy chief of the Argentine federal police, during the brief interim presidency of Raúl Lastiri in 1973. Reportedly, the movement was conceived at a high-level Peronist meeting on October 1, 1973, attended by President Raúl Lastiri, Interior Minister Benito Llambí, Social Welfare Minister José López Rega, general secretary of the Presidency José Humberto Martiarena and various provincial governors. The group operated under the governments of Lastiri, Perón and Isabel Perón through López Rega resignation and exile in July 1975. Villar and his wife were murdered in 1974 with a bomb that was planted on his cabin cruiser in Tigre by members of the \"Montoneros\", a militant, leftist group.\n\nLópez Rega, a devotee of occultism and self-styled divinator, became a powerful force in the Peronist movement. He exerted great influence over Perón, who was elected to the presidency and took office in 1973, and his wife Isabel Martínez de Perón, elected as vice-president, who succeeded to the presidency upon Perón's sudden death on 1 July 1974. To support the paramilitary group, López Rega drew on funds from the Ministry of Social Welfare, which he controlled. Some of the members of the Triple A had earlier taken part in the Peronist 1973 Ezeiza massacre. On the day Perón returned from exile, snipers shot and killed numerous (13 at least killed) left-wing Peronists at the mass gathering to welcome his return, leading to the definitive separation between left and right-wing Peronists.\n\nThe Spanish Judge Baltazar Garzón's investigations, directed at human rights abuses internationally, revealed that Italian neofascist Stefano Delle Chiaie had also worked with the Triple A, and was present at Ezeiza. Delle Chiaie also worked with the Chilean DINA in Chile, and for Hugo Banzer, a Bolivian dictator.\n\nAccording to a 1983 article in \"The New York Times\", the group was founded when there were an increasing number of guerrilla attacks by left-wing militant groups, which were met by harsh repression of political dissidents on the part of the military, paramilitary and police forces. This environment of social unrest was the justification used by the subsequent military junta for its Dirty War against political opponents. But testimony at the 1985 Juicio a las Juntas trial established that by 1976, both the ERP and the Montoneros had been dismantled, and the political dissidents had never posed a real threat to the government.\n\nThe group first came to national attention on 21 November 1973 in its attempt to murder Argentine Senator Hipólito Solari Yrigoyen by a car bomb. The AAA went on to kill 1,122 people, according to an appendix to the 1983 CONADEP report, including suspected Montoneros and ERP leftist terrorists and their sympathizers, but the group expanded its targets to other political opponents, including judges, police chiefs, and social activists. In total, it is suspected of having killed more than 1500 people.\n\nThe group is strongly suspected in the 1974 assassination of Jesuit priest Carlos Mugica, a friend of Mario Firmenich, the founder of Montoneros. Other people murdered by the organisation include Silvio Frondizi, brother of former president Arturo Frondizi; Julio Troxler, former-vice director of the police; Alfredo Curutchet, a defense attorney for political prisoners; and Hipólito Atilio López, a key union leader of Córdoba. The CONADEP commission on human rights violations documented the Triple A's execution of 19 homicides in 1973, 50 in 1974 and 359 in 1975, while its involvement in several hundred others is also suspected.\n\nThe 1986 study by Ignacio Jansen González is often cited; he estimates the group committed 220 terrorist attacks from July to September 1974, which killed 60 and severely wounded 44; as well as 20 kidnappings. Federal judge Norberto Oyarbide, who signed the extradition order against former leader of the AAA Rodolfo Almirón, ruled in December 2006 that Triple A's crimes qualified as human rights violations and the \"beginning of the systematic process directed by the state apparatus\" during the dictatorship.\n\nDeath threats caused many of the opposition to leave Argentina. Amongst many well-known and respected people who left are mathematician Manuel Sadosky, artists Héctor Alterio, Luis Brandoni and Nacha Guevara, politician and entrepreneur José Ber Gelbard, lawyer and politician Héctor Sandler, and actor Norman Briski.\n\nMain assassinations claimed by the AAA:\n\n\nAfter the fall of López Rega in 1975 and Jorge Rafael Videla's coup in March 1976, many Triple A members fled to Spain, where they became involved in assassinations of Spanish leftists. Fifteen former AAA members (including Rodolfo Almirón) were involved in the Montejurra 1976 shooting of two left-wing Carlist members at a large annual gathering in Spain. Others implicated in the event were Italian neofascist Stefano Delle Chiaie and Jean Pierre Cherid, former member of the French OAS and at the time part of the GAL death squad in Spain.\n\nFormer Triple A member José María Boccardo took part with Cherid and others in the 1978 assassination of Argala, the \"ETA\" terrorist who, in 1973, was involved in the assassination of Franco's Prime minister Luis Carrero Blanco.\n\n\n"}

He was active in Dadaism and later founded the Surrealist movement with André Breton. Soupault initiated the periodical \"Littérature\" together with the writers Breton and Louis Aragon in Paris in 1919, which, for many, marks the beginnings of Surrealism. The first book of automatic writing, \"Les Champs magnétiques\" (1920), was co-authored by Soupault and Breton. In 1927 Soupault, with the help of his then wife Marie-Louise, translated William Blake's \"Songs of Innocence and Experience\" into French. The next year, Soupault authored a monograph on Blake, arguing the poet was a \"genius\" whose work anticipated the Surrealist movement in literature.\n\nIn 1933 at a reception at the Russian Embassy in Paris, he met Ré Richter and they decided to do some travel reportage together. Ré Richter's photographs, taken with her 6x6 Rolleiflex, were to be published alongside Philippe Souault's literary texts. In the years thereafter, the two of them continued in the same vein, travelling to Germany, Switzerland, England, Scandinavia and Tunisia. They married in 1937. The couple separated after the end of the war; he moved back to Europe and she remained in New York.\n\nHe directed Radio Tunis from 1937 to 1940, when he was arrested by the pro-Vichy regime. He fled successfully to Algiers.\n\nAfter imprisonment by the Nazis during World War II, Soupault traveled to the United States, teaching at Swarthmore College but returned subsequently to France in October 1945. His works include such large volumes of poetry as \"Aquarium\" (1917) and \"Rose des vents\" [compass card] (1920) and the novel \"Les Dernières Nuits de Paris\" (1928; tr. Last Nights of Paris, 1929).\n\nIn 1957 he wrote the libretto for Germaine Tailleferre's opera \"La Petite Sirène\", based on Hans Christian Andersen's tale \"The Little Mermaid\".

Landrum for the Atari 2600 with the Starpath Supercharger cassette accessory. It was published in 1982 by Starpath (formerly Arcadia). The game is similar to \"Galaxian\", adding a variety of gameplay-changing options.\n\nAliens from the communist planet of Rooskee are invading peaceful, democratic planets and turning their inhabitants into \"Communist Mutants.\" The communist mutant armies are controlled by the Mother Creature, a strange alien who has gone mad due to irradiated vodka.\n\nThe player starts off with three reserve cannons. The object is to destroy the mutants aliens and, most importantly, the Mother Creature. The mutants hatch from moving eggs at the top of the screen. Because the Mother Creature replenishes eggs when they hatch or are destroyed, it must be defeated before the player can advance to the next wave. If a mutant or a bomb thrown by a mutant comes into contact with the cannon, the cannon will be destroyed and a reserve must be called up. A new cannon is awarded on every other wave.\n\nAn in-game menu allows a variety of gameplay changes. The player may toggle the shield option on or off. If activated, \"shield\" mode allowed a player to press down on the joystick to become invincible for a short period (only one shield was allotted per level). \"Time warp\" allows the player to press up on the joystick to temporarily slow the enemies. The type of shot fired can be changed by activating the \"penetrating fire\" option (which enhances the beam fired so that it can hit two mutants rather than one) and/or the \"guided fire\" option (which causes the beam to be moved with the joystick rather than firing in a straight line).\n\nThe menu also allows for multiple players (up to four) to play. Players one and three share the first joystick while players two and four share the second.\n\nHolding fire during power-on of the Atari 2600 causes the \"HI\" on the high scores screen to change to \"SHL\", the initials of programmer Stephen H.

It was re-released in the United Kingdom as a single in July 1970, and it became a #1 hit on the UK Singles Chart for the week ending 12 September 1970. Subsequently, Motown released \"The Tears of a Clown\" as a single in the United States as well, where it quickly became a #1 hit on both the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and R&B Singles charts.\n\nThis song is an international multi-million seller and a 2002 Grammy Hall of Fame inductee. Its success led Miracles lead singer, songwriter, and producer Smokey Robinson, who had announced plans to leave the act, to stay until 1972.\n\nStevie Wonder (who was discovered by Miracles member Ronnie White) and his producer Hank Cosby wrote the music for the song, and Cosby produced the instrumental track recording. Wonder brought the instrumental track to the 1966 Motown Christmas party because he could not come up with a lyric to fit the instrumental. Wonder wanted to see what Robinson could come up with for the track. Robinson, who remarked that the song's distinctive calliope motif \"sounded like a circus,\" provided lyrics that reflected his vision and sang lead vocal. In the song, his character, sad because a woman has left him, compares himself to the characters in the opera \"Pagliacci\", comedians/clowns who hide their hurt and anger behind empty smiles. He had used this comparison before: the line \"just like Pagliacci did/I'll try to keep my sadness hid\" appears in this song as well as in \"My Smile Is Just A Frown (Turned Upside Down)\", which he had written in 1964 for Motown artist Carolyn Crawford. The record is one of the few hit pop singles to feature the bassoon, which was played by Charles R. Sirard.\n\n\"The Tears of a Clown\" was an album track on 1967's \"Make It Happen\" but was not released as a single. \"The Tears of a Clown\" on the monaural version of \"Make It Happen\" contains an alternate lead vocal. By 1969, Robinson had become tired of constantly touring with the Miracles, and wanted to remain home in Detroit, Michigan, with his wife Claudette and their two children, Berry and Tamla (both named after aspects of the Motown corporation). Robinson informed his groupmates Pete Moore, Bobby Rogers, and best friend Ronald White that he would be retiring from the act to concentrate on his duties as vice-president of Motown Records.\n\nIn 1970, to capitalize on the Miracles' success there, and due to a lack of new material from the group, Motown Britain selected \"The Tears of a Clown\" from the group's catalog for single release. The single became a #1 hit in the UK seven weeks after its July release.\n\nThis newfound popularity prompted Motown to release the song as a single in the United States, using a new mix of the song made in February 1970 (whereas the UK release had used the original 1967 stereo mix from the \"Make It Happen\" LP). It became a #1 hit on both the pop and R&B charts within two months of its release. Despite the fact that the Miracles had been one of Motown's premier acts in the early and mid-1960s and its first successful group act, \"The Tears of a Clown\" was their first and only #1 hit while Smokey Robinson was lead singer. (The Miracles hit #1 again several years later with the smash hit \"Love Machine\", but by that time Smokey had long since left the group, replaced by Billy Griffin. \"Shop Around\" had hit #1 on the Cash Box Pop Chart, but only #2 on Billboard's.)\n\nThe 45 single was issued with two different B-sides: the first pressing had an alternate version of the 1967 Miracles Top 20 hit single \"The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage;\" the second had a new Miracles song, \"Promise Me\". Motown released a \"Tears of a Clown\" LP in 1970 as well, which was essentially a re-packaging of the Miracles' 1967 \"Make It Happen\". It was included again on the group's 1971 LP \"One Dozen Roses\", which used a new stereo mix.\n\nTwo years later, Smokey Robinson decided to follow through with his plans to leave the Miracles and retire. Smokey Robinson & the Miracles embarked on a six-month farewell tour, culminating in a July 16, 1972 performance in Washington, DC, where Robinson introduced the Miracles' new lead singer, Billy Griffin.\n\nThe song charted again in the UK in 1976, peaking at #34 (see The Miracles discography). \"The Tears of a Clown\" continues to be a popular radio request.\n\n\n\nIn 1979, British ska/new wave band The Beat released a cover of the song as their debut single. The double A-side with \"Ranking Full Stop\" reached number 6 on the UK Singles Chart, making it the band's third biggest hit.\n\nIt wasn't included on the original UK release of The Beat's debut album, \"I Just Can't Stop It\", but was included on the US release and has been included on subsequent CD reissues of the album.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a distinctive singer and an accomplished musician who played autoharp, banjo, fiddle, dulcimer, guitar, mouth harp, mandolin, dobro, jaw harp, and pan pipes. Seeger, a half-brother of Pete Seeger, produced more than 30 documentary recordings, and performed in more than 40 other recordings. He desired to make known the caretakers of culture that inspired and taught him.\n\nSeeger was born in New York and grew up in Maryland and Washington D.C. His father, Charles Louis Seeger Jr., was a composer and pioneering ethnomusicologist, investigating both American folk and non-Western music. His mother, Ruth Crawford Seeger, was a composer. His eldest half-brother, Charles Seeger III, was a radio astronomer, and his next older half-brother, John Seeger, taught for years at the Dalton School in Manhattan. His next older half brother was Pete Seeger. His uncle, Alan Seeger, the poet who wrote \"I have a rendezvous with Death\", was killed during the First World War. Seeger was a self-taught musician who began playing stringed instruments at the age of 18. He also sang Sacred Harp with British folk singer Ewan MacColl and his son, Calum. Seeger's sister Peggy Seeger, also a well-known folk performer, had married Ewan, and his sister Penny had wed John Cohen, a member of Mike's musical group, New Lost City Ramblers.\n\nThe family moved to Washington D.C. in 1936 after his father's appointment to the music division of the Resettlement Administration. While in Washington D.C., Ruth Seeger worked closely with John and Alan Lomax at the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress to preserve and teach American folk music. Ruth Seeger's arrangements and interpretations of American Traditional folk songs in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s are well regarded.\n\nAt about the age of 20, Mike Seeger began collecting songs by traditional musicians on a tape recorder. Folk musicians such as Lead Belly, Woody Guthrie, John Jacob Niles, and others were frequent guests in the Seeger home.\n\nIn 1958 he co-founded the New Lost City Ramblers, an old-time string band in New York City, during the Folk Revival. The other founding members included John Cohen and Tom Paley. Paley later left the group in 1962 and was replaced by Tracy Schwarz. The New Lost City Ramblers directly influenced countless musicians in subsequent years. The Ramblers distinguished themselves by focusing on the traditional playing styles they heard on old 78rpm records of musicians recorded during the 1920s and 1930s. Tracy was also in Mike's other band, Strange Creek Singers. So was Mike's former wife, Alice Gerrard. She was Alice Seeger in that band and sang and played guitar in it. The other people in Strange Creek Singers were bass player and singer Hazel Dickens and banjo player Lamar Grier. Mike sang and played guitar, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, autoharp, and harmonica in the band.\n\nSeeger received six Grammy nominations and was the recipient of four grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, including a 2009 National Heritage Fellowship, which is the United States' highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. His influence on the folk scene was described by Bob Dylan in his autobiography, \"\". He was a popular presenter and performer at traditional music gatherings such as Breakin' Up Winter.\n\nEight days before his 76th birthday, Mike Seeger died at his home in Lexington, Virginia, on August 7, 2009, after stopping cancer treatment.\n\nThe Mike Seeger Collection, which includes original sound and video recordings by Mike Seeger, is located in the Southern Folklife Collection of the Wilson Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the NHL's leading goal-scorer in 1938–39, his first season in the league. Conacher was a member of two Stanley Cup winning teams with the Bruins and scored the championship winning goal in 1939. He won the Art Ross Trophy in 1948–49 season as the NHL's leading point scorer and was named a first team All-Star.\n\nConacher was a member of the Memorial Cup winning West Toronto Nationals in 1935 as Canadian junior champions and was a member of the Ontario Hockey Association senior champion Toronto Dominions in 1937. Playing in the shadow of his more famous brothers Charlie and Lionel, Roy was known as the \"forgotten Conacher\". He was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1998, following his brothers to become the only trio of siblings so enshrined.\n\nRoy Conacher was born October 5, 1916, along with his twin brother Bert. They were the youngest children to Benjamin and Elizabeth Conacher and two of ten siblings: five boys and five girls. The family grew up in the Toronto neighbourhood of Davenport, which his brother Charlie described as \"one of Toronto's higher class slums\". His father was a teamster, and struggled to earn enough money to support the family. In the winter, he ploughed the snow off outdoor skating rinks to earn additional money.\n\nAll ten children were encouraged to participate in sports by the principal of Jesse Ketchum School, who felt that such pursuits would keep his students from getting into trouble. Roy joined his elder brothers in playing hockey, and having started younger than they had, was regarded as a better skater. Roy went on to join his brothers Lionel and Charlie in professional hockey. Bert was also an aspiring hockey player but his professional hopes were ended when lost an eye in his late teens to a freak accident while the brothers were playing street hockey in front of their home.\n\nConacher played his minor hockey with the Toronto Marlboro organization and was a member of Ontario provincial championship winning teams at the bantam and midget age groups. He next played junior hockey with the West Toronto Nationals in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) junior league between 1933 and 1936. In his third season, 1935–36, Conacher led the OHA junior league in scoring with 12 goals in 10 games. The Nationals, led by Roy and Bert Conacher, won the OHA title and reached the 1936 Memorial Cup final against the Saskatoon Wesleys. In 12 Memorial Cup playoff games, Roy Conacher recorded eight goals and five assists. West Toronto won the best-of-three final in two consecutive games, 5–1 and 4–2, to capture the Dominion junior championship. Conacher played two seasons of senior hockey, first with the Toronto Dominions of the OHA senior league in 1936–37 where he was an all-star for the OHA senior championship winning squad. He then played with then the Kirkland Lake Hargreaves of the Northern Ontario Hockey Association.\n\nThe Boston Bruins invited Conacher to their amateur camp in 1935 where the then 17-year-old made a good impression on manager Art Ross. Following his two seasons of senior hockey, the Bruins signed Conacher to a contract on October 23, 1938. He made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut in the 1938–39 season and recorded 37 points in 47 games. Conacher scored four goals in Boston's 8-2 victory of Chicago on February 21, 1939. His 26 goals were the most in the league; it would be 54 years before another rookie, Teemu Selänne, would lead the league. Conacher added ten points in 12 playoff games, including both goals in a 2–0 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs in the fourth game of the 1939 Stanley Cup Final, and he scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in the deciding contest.\n\nConacher remained a leading offensive threat throughout his tenure with Boston; he was one of the NHL's top ten scorers in his first four seasons, including the 1939–40 season despite missing 16 games due to a broken wrist. He also finished second in goals in both 1940–41 and 1941–42 with 24 goals in each campaign. By 1941, he had joined with Eddie Wiseman and Bill Cowley to form the \"Three Gun Line\", so named because all three players were considered top scoring threats. Conacher had only one goal during the 1941 Stanley Cup playoffs, but the Bruins were the NHL's dominant team and swept the Detroit Red Wings in the Final to win their second Stanley Cup in three years.\n\nIn 1942, Conacher left the Bruins to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force for the duration of the Second World War where he served as a physical training instructor. He continued to play hockey in the Canadian military leagues, playing first for the Saskatoon RCAF team in 1942–43, then with the Dartmouth RCAF for the following two seasons. He led the Halifax city league with nine goals in 1943–44. Toward the end of the war, Conacher was deployed to England where he continued to play with military teams, but the deployment also meant he was unavailable to return to the Bruins at the start of the 1945–46 season like many of his teammates did. He appeared in only four games late in the season following his discharge from the military.\n\nArt Ross feared that Conacher would not be able to return to his previous form due to losing four seasons to military service when he was in his physical prime and opted to trade him. Prior to the 1946–47 season, Ross sent Conacher to the Detroit Red Wings in exchange for Joe Carveth. Conacher excelled with Detroit. He led the team with 30 goals and 54 points, seventh best in the league, and scored four goals in one game that were all assisted by Billy Taylor on a night where the latter player set an NHL record with seven assists. Art Ross, once asked what his biggest mistake as a general manager was, replied \"trading Roy Conacher\".\n\nConacher became embroiled in a bitter contract dispute with Detroit manager Jack Adams following the season. Adams offered $7,600 for the season, but Conacher refused to sign for less than $8,500. Refusing to bow to his demands, Adams traded Conacher to the New York Rangers on October 22, 1947, in exchange for Edward Slowinski and a player to be named later. Conacher, however, refused to report to the Rangers. He announced instead that he planned to retire from hockey, a decision he claimed to have been mulling over for a couple years. The trade to New York was nullified as a result of Conacher's failure to report. Bill Tobin of the Chicago Black Hawks received permission from Detroit to speak with Conacher and successfully negotiated a deal with the player. Tobin claimed the negotiation was easy: \"It wasn't hard to sign Roy. I offered him so much money he couldn't refuse.\" Tobin did not reveal what he was paying Conacher, but admitted that he spent $25,000 combined on the contract and to purchase him from Detroit.\n\nConacher averaged nearly a point per game in 1947–48 with 48 points in 52 games. His best statistical season came in 1948–49 when he won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's leading point scorer playing on a line with Bill Mosienko and Doug Bentley on a team that was coached by his brother Charlie. Conacher recorded 68 points while his 26 goals were good enough for second in the league. Additionally, he was named to the first All-Star team at left wing and played in the 1949 All-Star Game. He remained among the league's scoring leaders in 1949–50 as his 56 points were sixth-best in the league. He followed that up by leading the Black Hawks in goals (26) and points (50) in 1950–51. Conacher scored his 200th career goal during the season, at the time a rare feat for an NHL player. However, the physical toll of the sport caught up to him; after playing 12 games of the 1951–52 season, he opted to retire from the NHL. Chicago replaced him with his nephew, Pete Conacher.\n\nDuring his final four seasons in the NHL, Conacher lived in Midland, Ontario. He remained in the community with his wife Fran and children Roy Jr., Mark and Candace. Keeping active in hockey, he coached Midland's junior C team to a provincial championship and regularly played with oldtimers teams. Conacher later moved to Victoria, British Columbia where, after an eight-year battle with cancer, he died in 1984.\n\nRoy was one of several members of the Conacher family to play in the NHL. Three of his nephews, Pete and Brian Conacher, and Murray Henderson all followed. Cory Conacher is also a distant relative of his. Roy was relatively anonymous compared to his more famous brothers Lionel and Charlie, and was often referred to as the \"forgotten Conacher\". Roy's career was recognized by the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1998 when he was posthumously inducted by the veterans committee. He joined Charlie (1961) and Lionel (1994) as the only trio of brothers to be so honoured. Lionel Conacher, Jr. was a CFL football player.\n\n"}

He was one of the first American artists to take up Impressionism in the late 1880s, visiting Giverny and developing a close friendship with Claude Monet. Several of his works are considered masterpieces of American Impressionism.\n\nRobinson was born in Irasburg, Vermont. His family moved to Evansville, Wisconsin, and Robinson briefly studied art in Chicago. In 1874 he journeyed to New York City to attend classes at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League.\n\nIn 1876 he traveled to Paris to study under Carolus-Duran and at the École des Beaux-Arts, with Jean-Léon Gérôme. He first exhibited his paintings at the 1877 Salon in Paris, and spent the summer of that year at Grez-sur-Loing.\n\nAfter trips to Venice and Bologna, he returned to the United States in 1879 for several years. In 1881 he moved into a studio in New York and became a professional painter and art teacher. During this time Robinson painted in a realist manner, loosely brushed but not yet impressionistic, often depicting people engaged in quiet domestic or agrarian pursuits.\n\nIn 1884 Robinson returned to France where he lived for the next eight years, visiting America only occasionally. Robinson gravitated to Giverny, which had become a center of French impressionist art under the influence of Claude Monet.\n\nHistorians are unclear when Robinson met Monet, but by 1888 their friendship was enough for Robinson to move in next door to the famous impressionist. Robinson's art shifted to a more traditional impressionistic manner during this time, likely due to Monet's influence. While a number of American artists had gathered at Giverny, none were as close to Monet as Robinson. Monet offered advice to Robinson, and he likewise solicited Robinson for opinions on Monet's own works in progress.\n\nNot only did he take to heart Monet´s theoretical admonitions and his requirement to portray the beauties and mystery of nature in a manner stringently truthful to one's personal vision, but he also studied works that were available to him in \"The Master´s\" studio. For instance, \"Capri\", painted in 1890, was probably inspired by Monet´s paintings of the cliffs at Varengeville, Pourville, and Etretat and the rocks at Bell-Ile of the early 1880s.\n\nAt Giverny, Robinson painted what art historians regard as some of his finest works. These depicted the surrounding countryside in different weather, in the plein air tradition, sometimes with women shown in leisurely poses. An example of his mature work during this period is \"La Débâcle\" (1892) in the collection of Scripps College, Claremont California.\n\nRobinson left France and Monet for the final time in 1892, although he meant to return. Back in America, Robinson obtained a teaching post with the Brooklyn Art School and conducted summer classes in Napanoch, New York, near the Catskill Mountains, where he painted several canal scenes. He also taught at Evelyn College in Princeton, New Jersey, and later at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia.\n\nWith New York City as his base, Robinson circulated among a growing number of American artists pursuing Impressionism. He was particularly close to John Henry Twachtman and Julian Alden Weir, and spent time at the nearby Cos Cob Art Colony in Connecticut. There he painted a series of boat scenes at the Riverside Yacht Club which have come to be regarded as among his finest works.\n\nWhile his reputation as an important American Impressionist was growing, Robinson still needed to teach to support himself. He also harbored doubts about the quality of his work.\n\nThroughout his career, Theodore Robinson kept meticulous diaries, but only the last several years of the diaries are known to exist. These are in the collection of the Frick Art Reference Library in New York and available to scholars. The art historian Sona Johnson, of the Baltimore Museum of Art, plans to publish an annotated edition of the Robinson diaries.\n\nIn the last year of his life he was asked to contribute to the book of essays titled \"Modern French Masters\" by the editor and art historian John Charles Van Dyke. He wrote an essay on the Barbizon painter Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and, because of his friendship with the French Impressionist, he wrote and illustrated the essay on Claude Monet. The book was published in 1896 and his illustration of Monet was featured in the exhibition \"In Monet's Light.\"\n\nIn 1895, Robinson enjoyed a productive period in Vermont, and in February 1896 he wrote to Monet about returning to Giverny, but in April he died of an acute asthma attack in New York City. He was buried in his hometown of Evansville, Wisconsin. He was 43 years old.\n\nToday Robinson's paintings are in the collections of many major museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City; the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; and the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\n"}

In the previous verse the magi had informed King Herod that they had seen portents showing the birth of the King of the Jews. In this verse he reacts to this news.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 2:3.\n\nThat Herod should be troubled by the King of the Jews being born is not surprising. As an Edomite Herod was open to challenge from someone claiming to be the heir of King David, and the central theme of Matthew 1 is Jesus' Davidic status. Moreover, Herod was renowned for his paranoia, killing several of his own sons who threatened him.\n\nWhy all Jerusalem should be troubled is a more important question. Throughout this chapter Matthew shows the leaders of Jerusalem allied with Herod against the new messiah. These passages have been quoted in support of Christian anti-Semitism. That all Jerusalem is agitated also seems to conflict with later in the Gospel when the people are oblivious to Jesus. France suggests that the passage could perhaps be read as showing that the people of Jerusalem were troubled because of the possibility of Herod's wrath. Other scholars see this interpretation as being fairly implausible. Brown notes that this phrase originates in Exodus. There is a theory that this part of Matthew is heavily influenced by the story of Moses. In Exodus all Egypt is troubled by Moses, not just the Pharaoh. Thus in parallel all Jerusalem must also be troubled. This view was shared by St. Chrysostom.\n\nGundry sees this passage as influenced by the politics of the time it was written, a foreshadowing of the rejection of Jesus and his church by the leaders of Jerusalem. Similarly Keener argues that Matthew is contrasting the goodness of the pagan Magi against the residents of Jerusalem as part of his overall advocacy of Christian outreach beyond the Jewish community. Matthew challenges his reader's negative views of outsiders by contrasting these foreigners with the behaviour of those in Jerusalem. Levin believes the verse reflects Matthew's social critique. She argues that throughout the Gospel he denigrates the wealthy and powerful city dwellers while elevating nomads like the magi and those who live in villages and rural areas.\n\nGundry notes that this verse again makes sure to note Herod is a king. He sees this as an effort by the author of Matthew to create a deliberate contrast with Jesus, with Herod being the embodiment of all the things Jesus is not.\n"}

He served in the administration of Bill Clinton and was the senior health care advisor to Barack Obama. From 2003 to 2008, Cutler was Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for Social Sciences.\n\nWhile his work on health economics covers a broad range of subtopics, he is particularly notable for his work on the value of the health care system as a whole. Much of his work argues that the United States has realized good \"bang for its buck\" by any reasonable measure of the value of a statistical year of life in good health: health care there is extremely expensive, but Americans also place a very high value on documentable health gains. He also argues that they could gain considerably more health for the dollar if reimbursement for care were tied to the health value of the service instead of the intensity of the service.\n\nHis book \"Your Money or Your Life\" gives an introduction on the US health care system. The book and Cutler's ideas were the subject of an article in the \"New York Times Magazine\", \"The Quality Cure\". Professor Cutler published a book with the same title in 2014 which details how \"Focusing on Health Care Quality Can Save Your Life and Lower Spending Too.\"\n\nCutler's 2003 study \"Why have Americans become more obese?\" discusses rising obesity as an outcome of the revolution in mass food packaging. He includes vacuum packing, improved preservatives, deep freezing, and microwaves as culprits. Consumer prices on items like various frozen foods, soda, and potato chips are increasing at half the rate of fresh fruits and vegetables, and mass preparation makes for lower costs and more food consumption.\n\nCalories expended, however, changed little. Accordingly, Cutler posits that the 20 min average reduced time of food preparation has resulted in an average increase of 100 Cal per day per individual. The extra 100 Cal can largely account for a weight gain of 10-12 lb in the American population over the past 20 years.\n\nAn article, ″Selection Stories: Understanding Movement across Health Plans,″ was written by Cutler, Bryan Lincoln, and Richard Zeckhauser and published in the \"Journal of Health Economics\" in 2010. It explored why some employees who participate in employee-sponsored insurance programs change enrollment status between Health Maintenance Organization-managed care and fee for service options. The authors theorized that there are three different health insurance selection processes that individuals engage in that influence personal insurance selection, which include backward-looking selection, adverse retention, and aging in place.\n\nBackward-looking selection is explained as past experiences influencing the level of insurance acquired by an individual. For example, someone who became severely ill and did not have enough insurance coverage might seek out more insurance coverage, as a result of the previous experience.\n\nAdverse retention refers to both those choosing to maintain the current level of coverage when they are ill and the unlikelihood of the individual switching insurance plans the more they are ill.\n\nAging in place refers to someone remaining on the same plan for life because insurance provided is sufficient and the cost of switching is too high.\n\nThe study conducted analyses by creating models based on data from the Massachusetts state employee health insurance programs. The data was aggregated by HMO and FFS.\n\nBased on the analyses and modeling, adverse selection and adverse retention were very small compared to the projected impact from premium increases for enrollees. In other words, as premiums increase, enrollment in FFS dramatically decreased. That finding was also demonstrated in a literature review published by the RAND corporation.\n\nAlthough there is little difference in terms of selection effects between HMOs and FFS since the enrollee pays a small portion of marginal costs, Cutler contends that adverse selection (less-healthy individuals moving from more restrictive HMO to less-restrictive and more-costly FFS plans) has a greater impact than adverse retention on enrollees' choice of health plans.\n\nIn summary, movement from adverse selection and adverse retention is minimal, but it is highly correlated and concentrated in the older and less healthy population, favoring HMO plans by their lower premiums and economic stability. Overall, adverse selection and retention are not critical factors in adjusting risk for health care plans, but demographics such as sex and age seem to be significant in spending patterns and differences in plan choices.\n\nThe article explored the trends and rationale behind the shift from FFS to HMO. In terms of overall quality of care provided, based on the type of health insurance, current literature suggest that the quality of care does not differ between HMO and FFS plans.\n\nThe article is timely in that it is relevant to the overall shift towards managed care in an effort to reduce health care costs, without reducing quality of care. In addition, it is relevant to the current discussions concerning the possibility of having competitive choice health insurance plans based upon risk adjustments.\n\n\n"}

Bunch is currently the founding director and senior scholar at the Center for Women's Global Leadership at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. She is also a distinguished professor in the Department of Women's and Gender Studies at Rutgers.\n\nBunch, one of four children to Charles Pardue Bunch and Marjorie Adelaide (King) Bunch, was born in West Jefferson, North Carolina. That same year, her family moved to Artesia, New Mexico. She attended public schools in Artesia before enrolling at Duke University in 1962.\n\nShe was a history major at Duke and graduated magna cum laude in 1966, and was involved with many groups such as the Young Women's Christian Association and the Methodist Student Movement. Bunch has said that she participated in \"pray-ins\" organized by the Methodist Student Movement at Duke University, but later took a \"break\" from Christianity because of the homophobia within the religion.\n\nShe has been extremely active in political movements for decades and is openly lesbian. She found inspiration for being a women's and human rights activist through her family's dedication to \"activism as good works.\"\n\nShortly after graduating from Duke University, Bunch became a youth delegate to the World Council of Churches Conference on Church and Society in Geneva, Switzerland. That same year she became president of the University Christian Movement in Washington D.C. for one year.\n\nFollowing this position, Bunch became a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington D.C., and she founded the Washington D.C. publications, \"Women's Liberation\" and \"\".\n\nThrough inspiration from Black Nationalism, Bunch took part in founding The Furies Collective, a group that published its first newspaper, \"The Furies\", in January 1972. The goal was to give a voice to lesbian separatism. While the collective only survived for about one year, the home of the Furies Collective later was named the first lesbian-related historic landmark in Washington D.C., and became the first lesbian site on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 1977, Bunch became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. She participated in or facilitated numerous international workshops and conferences, and from 1979 to 1980 she was a consultant to the secretariat for the World Conference for the United Nations Decade on Women which was hosted by WIFP.\n\nIn 1989, she founded the Center for Women's Global Leadership at Douglass College, Rutgers University, of which she remains the founding director and senior scholar. She was succeeded as executive director by Radhika Balakrishnan in September 2009.\n\nThe Center for Women's Global Leadership (CWGL) lobbied the United Nations and the international community to view women's rights as a human rights issue. CWGL is a component of the Gender Equality Architecture Reform (GEAR) Campaign, working towards the establishment of a new United Nations Gender Entity that works for equality for all of the world's women. Bunch has been a major voice for this campaign. The gender entity was finally created after four years of advocacy on July 2, 2010, and deemed UN Women.\n\nAt its 20th-anniversary symposium on March 6, 2010, following panel discussions on body, economy, and movement, CWGL organized a tribute to its founder, Charlotte Bunch, who transitioned on September 1, 2009 from her role as executive director to working with CWGL in her new capacity as founding director and senior scholar. Attendees watched a short preview of the then-upcoming documentary film \"Passionate Politics: The Life & Work of Charlotte Bunch\" (2011), directed by Tami Gold, which chronicles Bunch's lifelong personal and political commitment to women's human rights.\n\nThe Center for Women's Global Leadership launched the Charlotte Bunch Women's Human Rights Strategic Opportunities Fund in recognition of her contributions to the global women's human rights movement.\n\nShe has served on the boards of numerous organizations and is currently a member of the Advisory Committee for the Human Rights Watch Women's Rights Division, and on the boards of the Global Fund for Women and the International Council on Human Rights Policy. She has been a consultant to many United Nations bodies and recently served on the Advisory Committee for the Secretary General's \"2006 Report to the General Assembly on Violence against Women\". She has also voiced her support for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reform in the United Nations.\n\nIn October 1996, Bunch was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. In December 1999 she was selected by United States President Bill Clinton as a recipient of the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights. She received the \"Women Who Make a Difference Award\" from the National Council for Research on Women in 2000, and was honored as one of the \"21 Leaders for the 21st Century\" by \"Women's eNews\" in 2002, and also received the \"Board of Trustees Awards for Excellence in Research\" in 2006 at Rutgers University.\n\n\nBunch has written and edited many pieces of work, which focus on women's rights and human rights. The papers of Charlotte Bunch can be found at the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe Institute.

The original Māori name of the locality was Mokoreta (clear or sweet water).\n\nThe name \"Wyndham\" was first used in the district when John Anderson named his runs 161 and 162 Upper Windham Station and Lower Windham Station in 1857. The name was soon mis-spelt to its more common form and the Mokoreta river also became known as the Wyndham river. The town was then named in 1869 for the adjacent river, so indirectly named for General Sir Charles Ash Windham who fought in the Crimean War. The streets are in turn named for events, places, battles and personalities from that war. The town was initially surveyed in 1869 and gazetted a town district in 1882.\n\nWyndham is situated on the east banks of the Mataura River, between the Mimihau Stream to the north and the Wyndham (Mokoreta) River to the south. Protected now by a floodbank, Wyndham is a service centre for the surrounding districts with a shopping centre, library, museum and hotel. For eighty years, it was served by the Wyndham Branch railway which provided a connection with the Main South Line, and for forty years, an extension past Wyndham was operated to Glenham.\n\nWyndham has a primary school, Wyndham Primary School, whose principal is Kim Scott and educates students between year zero and year six. Situated directly beside the primary school is Menzies College, Wyndham's secondary school. Menzies College has approximately 300 students who range from year seven to year 13. The current principal is Gerry Ward.\n\nA recreational area has a golf course, race course, rugby ground, softball diamond, bowling green, tennis/netball courts and camping ground. Brown trout fishing is within walking distance as well.\nThe town used to host the Wyndham street races as part of the Burt Monro Challenge, Wyndham one day street racing event of the week-long calendar. The biggest current gathering of motorcycle enthusiasts in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nWyndham originally had a dairy factory established in 1885 and a flax milling factory named \"The Field-Gibson Flax Milling Company\" established in 1903, but these have both long since closed.\n"}

{"id": "1888913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888913", "title": "Landover Mall", "text": "Landover Mall\n\nLandover Mall was a large shopping mall located in Landover, Maryland, directly across from FedExField, off MD 202 and Interstates 95 and 495. The mall was built by Sonny Abramson and Ted Lerner of Lerner Enterprises, and opened in 1972. Like its neighbor, Capital Plaza Mall, it was a major attraction through its opening years in Prince George's County. The mall featured many anchors and smaller tenants; however, upon the decline and closing of its major anchors, the mall itself entered a state of decline. Finally, in 2002, the mall's doors were closed and it ultimately was demolished in 2006. Sears remained open because it owned the land beneath the store. Sears later sold the land underneath its store to Lerner. In January 2014 Sears announced that it would close in March.\n\nThe mall had three fountains, one adjacent to Hecht's, Sears, and in center court. According to an article in the Washington Post published the day of the mall's grand opening, the Hecht's \"The water display consists of seven 3\" geysers that are programmed in continuously changing programs of water height (3' to 15') for the perimeter nozzles, and the center nozzle can push the water to a height of 30' if desirable. All splash will be contained in the perimeter six geysers.\" The main fountain in the mall contained three circular platforms, each representing a loop within the Capital Beltway interchange at Landover Road. During the holiday season the center ring fountains would be shut off and replaced with its annual secular Holiday displays, which featured gingerbread house, fairies, candy canes, snowmen, reindeer, sleigh ride, doves and a \"Cupcake Boat Ride\", but no Santa or explicit references to Christmas. Toys For Tots once did a charity event where they would go fishing in the fountain.\n\nIn its prime, Landover Mall had three local department store anchors: Hecht's, Garfinckel's, Woodward & Lothrop (Woodies), and two national chains, Sears and F.W. Woolworths https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._Woolworth_Company. It was the first mall in the region to have four anchors until Fair Oaks Mall opened in 1980. There was a six-screen theater in the basement, which had its own escalators, but it closed in 1991. In 1990, Garfinckel's filed for bankruptcy and went out of business. The former Garfinckel's anchor store was never replaced. Five years later, Woodies went out of business. JCPenney moved into the former Woodies location but found business unprofitable. The store was converted to a JCPenney outlet location in fall 1998 and was closed altogether in early 2001. In early 2002, Hecht's closed after opening a new store at Bowie Town Center in nearby Bowie, Maryland.\n\nAfter the closure of the main anchors to the mall, Ted Lerner decided to shut the mall down completely. The mall's doors were sealed shut with cinder blocks, although the Sears store remained open.\n\nDemolition began in 2006, and was completed in early 2007. The entire mall was demolished, and its aftermath was recycled. Sears was the only store that remained open after the mall's closure because it owned the land on which the building stood. However, its former entrances to the mall were sealed shut on both its levels. Sears subsequently sold the land underneath the store to Lerner. In January 2014 Sears announced that it would not renew its lease with Lerner and closed its store in March.\n\nIn 2014 the FBI announced they were looking at possibly purchasing the land for a future FBI Headquarters after the acquisition of Sears land, but this fell through and in October 2018, Lerner put the whole site, with the Sears now demolished, up for sale. it is still on the market.\n\nSears was tentatively planning on relocating to the Ritchie Station Marketplace shopping center on Ritchie Road near Capitol Heights, Maryland. The area of the former mall and parking lot is now fenced off and barricaded with cement blocks. Landover Mall's main entrance sign has been modified to eliminate its stylized cloverleaf logo shape with the remaining part of the sign and pedestal refurbished to new-like appearance and saying \"Home to Future Development\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1888922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888922", "title": "The Clicking of Cuthbert", "text": "The Clicking of Cuthbert\n\nThe Clicking of Cuthbert is a collection of ten short stories by P. G. Wodehouse, all with a golfing theme. It was first published in the United Kingdom on 3 February 1922 by Herbert Jenkins Ltd of London. It was later published in the United States by George H. Doran of New York on 28 May 1924 under the title Golf Without Tears. The short stories were originally published in magazines between 1919 and 1922.\n\nThere are some slight differences between the two editions, chiefly as regards the names of characters, places, and famous golfers, which were adapted to suit the country of publication. The first story in the collection introduces the Oldest Member, a repeat Wodehouse character, who narrates all but the last story.\n\nAs with most of the stories in the collection, the UK version of the story is set in England, while the US version is set in the United States.\n\n\nThe Oldest Member (of a golf club with varying names) sees a young man giving up his clubs because he thinks golf is waste of time. To show the young man that playing golf can be useful, the Oldest Member tells him the following story about Cuthbert Banks.\n\nIn the suburb of Wood Hills, there is a divide between the Cultured, the intellectuals of the Wood Hills Literary and Debating Society, and the Golfers, the members of the local golf club. Mrs Emily Smethurst, president of the literary society, wants the neighbourhood to be cultured and disapproves of the golf club. The society's meeting place is near the golf course, and their sudden applause during a novelist's lecture causes golfer J. Cuthbert Banks to accidentally hit his ball into the room onto a table. He apologetically comes in to play the ball where it lies, and falls in love with Mrs Smethurst's niece, Adeline. He eventually proposes to her but she turns him down, since she is ambitious and, feeling she is too ordinary herself to be noteworthy, wants to marry someone noteworthy. Cuthbert is a skilled golfer and won the French Open Championship the previous year, but Adeline does not consider this a noteworthy achievement. She admires Raymond Parsloe Devine, the novelist who gave the lecture. Cuthbert joins the society to please Adeline, but she continues to adore Devine.\n\nVladimir Brusiloff, a famous Russian writer of dreary novels, is in the country on a lecturing tour and comes to Wood Hills, to the delight of Mrs Smethurst and her society. Brusiloff, tired of giving lectures and meeting aspiring writers, is in a bad mood when Mrs Smethurst introduces him to Devine. Devine says he was greatly influenced by Russian writers named Sovietski and Nastikoff, but Brusiloff coldly remarks that they are no good. Devine's prestige in the literary society is immediately shattered and he slinks away. Adeline loses all her respect for him. Brusiloff mentions that he wants to meet the golfers Abe Mitchell and Harry Vardon. (Walter Hagen and Jock Hutchison in the US version of the story.) Cuthbert mentions that he knows them. Brusiloff recognizes Cuthbert's name and is honoured to meet him, since he won the French Open. Adeline now admires Cuthbert. She marries him and becomes a fan of golf. Devine had to leave the neighbourhood and is now writing scenarios for films in California.\n\nAs the Oldest Member is finishing the story, his listener rushes out to get back his clubs.\n\nIn this story, the golf club is called the Woodhaven Golf Club in the \"Strand\" version, and the Manhooset Golf Club in the \"Saturday Evening Post\" version.\n\nFrom the terrace in front of the golf club, the Oldest Member sees Peter Willard and James Todd playing golf together, and tells the following story about them.\n\nPeter and James are close friends who regularly play golf together. Both have little skill at golf but greatly enjoy the game. However, their relationship becomes strained when they both fall in love with Grace Forrester. Grace seems to like them equally. The club becomes interested and members bet on which man will win Grace's favour. One day, news spreads that Grace is knitting a sweater. James and Peter believe that she is knitting the sweater for the man she prefers, and try to determine how big the sweater will be, since Peter is big and James is small. However, it turns out she is merely knitting a sock for a relative. Since they are always around Grace at the same time, James and Peter believe that they have got each other stymied by preventing each other from wooing her, so they agree to decide the matter with an eighteen-hole match. The loser will stay away from Grace long enough for the winner to have a chance to court her. To prepare, James studies a book on golf, but feels bad that he is not reading it with Peter, since they used to often read golf books together.\n\nIn their match, Peter and James play about the same, both sometimes playing well and sometimes worse. After the ninth hole, James takes a short break, claiming he needs to get a few more balls, though he is actually looking at his golf book for tips. When James joins Peter on the tenth tee, he notices that Peter's manner is strange. Peter forfeits the match and says that James is free to propose to Grace. James thanks him and goes to talk to Grace, who plays tennis nearby. He talks to her in detail about golf, and is shocked when Grace says it is all gibberish to her. She finds golf boring and silly. James is revolted and rejoins Peter. Peter says he had spoken to Grace a few minutes before and also heard her feelings about golf. They are glad they found out in time and plan to play golf more often together. James tells Peter about his golf book and invites James to read it. They clasp hands and are close friends again.\n\n\nA golfer at the club is annoyed by children playing on the course and says golf should only be played by adults. The Oldest Member disagrees and argues that golf, like measles, should be caught young. If not, a golfer who starts playing later in life may become too absorbed in the game too quickly. He tells the story of Mortimer Sturgis to illustrate his point.\n\nThe Oldest Member's friend Betty Weston, who plays golf, is engaged to spectacled 38-year-old Mortimer Sturgis, who is not a golfer but is amiable and has independent means. Eddie Denton, Mortimer's best friend, is an explorer and returns from Central Africa. The Oldest Member is not impressed by explorers, but Betty admires bravery and is fascinated by Eddie. Betty is very interested when Eddie recounts an exaggerated story about how he shot a crocodile. Soon, she has fallen in love with him, and goes to the Oldest Member for advice. Eddie returns Betty's feelings but neither of them want to hurt Mortimer. The Oldest Member gets an idea. He will lie to Mortimer that Betty is a kleptomaniac so he will not want to marry her. Betty thanks the Oldest Member for his help.\n\nMortimer is learning golf from the Oldest Member for Betty's sake. Initially, Mortimer dislikes the game, but he begins to enjoy it after he starts playing better. The Oldest Member tells Mortimer that Betty is a kleptomaniac, but this fails to change Mortimer's opinion of her. Mortimer quickly becomes extremely devoted to golf, and as a result he spends less time with Betty. When Betty complains that he is neglecting her, Mortimer only talks more about golf. She does not feel obliged to remain with Mortimer anymore and ends their engagement. Mortimer recovers quickly from this and remains focused on golf. He has a handicap of eighteen and continues to improve. Betty and Eddie are now happily married. Mortimer was too busy with a tournament to attend their wedding, but sent golf balls and a patent Sturgis putter as wedding gifts.\n\n\nA young man comes into the club-house, having just played golf because of his enthusiasm for the game despite the cold and snowy weather. The Oldest Member is reminded of another enthusiastic golfer, Mortimer Sturgis. The young man heard the first story about him, \"A Mixed Threesome\". The Oldest Member tells him another story about Mortimer.\n\nMortimer is now 42 years old and has a handicap of twelve. (Later in life, he will bring it down to nine.) He is more passionate about golf than ever. In the winter, Mortimer goes to the sunny South of France to play golf there. At the hotel, he meets a woman with golden hair, Miss Somerset. The Oldest Member believes they both fell in love at first sight. Her left wrist is in a sling. She says she strained it playing the championship. Mortimer assumes she is Mary Somerset, champion of the Ladies' Open Golf Championship, and is thrilled to meet her. They spend more time together. When he is golfing, she vaguely suggests he give the ball a hard knock when he asks for advice, and he is delighted to have her help. She says yes when he asks if he can call her Mary. He proposes to her. She gladly accepts him, though she seems somewhat disquieted when he says he is excited to be marrying a first-class golfer.\n\nThey are quietly married a few weeks later. They spend their honeymoon in Italy and then go to Mortimer's little house near the golf course. When he asks her to play golf with him, she confesses that she deceived Mortimer. She is actually Mabel Somerset, a champion croquet player. Mary Somerset is her cousin. She did not clarify this to Mortimer because she was in love and wanted to marry him. Distraught, she disappears before Mortimer can talk to her and leaves a letter saying she wronged him and is going away somewhere. Mortimer still loves her and tries to find her by hiring private detectives and advertising in all the papers. Summer and autumn pass without Mortimer finding her. (The young man listening to the story objects that it is too depressing, but the Oldest Member assures him it will not end badly.) On Christmas Eve, Mabel returns at last. She explains that she left to make herself worthy of him and studied golf in Scotland under a famous golfer named Tammas McMickle. Her handicap is 24. Mortimer's handicap has risen to 24. He is delighted to have her back, and happy that they will be playing golf together.\n\n\nThe Oldest Member discusses annoying golfers who talk incessantly on the course. He tells the following story about George Mackintosh, a golfer who was very talkative before being cured.\n\nGeorge falls in love with Celia Tennant, but is too diffident to speak to her. He asks the Oldest Member for advice. The Oldest Member points out an advertisement in a magazine for a correspondence course on becoming a convincing talker. George decides to try out the course for a week or two and then ask for a higher salary at the law firm where he works. If this succeeds, he will continue the course. A few weeks later, George is now talkative, confident, and somewhat overbearing. He has convinced his boss to give him a raise and has also become engaged to Celia. George talks incessantly on the links, and the other players get annoyed and avoid him. Celia also becomes irritated by George's constant talking.\n\nThe Oldest Member invites Celia to play golf with him, and suggests she bring George along so they can reason with him. While the Oldest Member and Celia play golf, George talks a great deal about a variety of subjects but particularly criticizes Celia's playing. This exasperates Celia, though George does not notice. The Oldest Member, whose concentration on the game is affected by George's prattling, slices his drive into the woods on the right, and after playing another, he goes into the woods to find his ball. While searching, he hears Celia call out to him. She tells him she snapped and hit George with her niblick. He ended up on his back on the ground. Celia regrets hitting him, though he quickly recovers. She and the Oldest Member tell him what happened. He is back to normal and is amazed Celia stuck with him despite his bothersome chatting. They share an embrace. The Oldest Member concludes that it is possible but difficult to cure extremely chatty golfers.\n\nIn this story, the club is called the Marvis Bay Golf and Country Club in the \"Strand\" version. It is called the Manhooset Golf and Country Club and is located near New York in the \"Collier's\" version.\n\nThe Oldest Member watches a group of players struggle on the course. After one of them tries to blame his caddie for distracting him, The Oldest Member remarks that few men possess the proper golfing temperament, and is reminded of a story about Mitchell Holmes.\n\nMitchell is a young man employed by the Paterson Dyeing and Refining Company, of which the president is Alexander Paterson, an old friend of the Oldest Member. Mitchell is engaged to Millicent Boyd, but needs a larger salary to get married. One evening, Alexander Paterson visits the Oldest Member and asks him for advice. The treasurer of his company is retiring soon, and there are two men capable of holding the job, but he does not know which one is more trustworthy. The Oldest Member suggests that Alexander find out each man's true character by playing golf with him, without telling them it is a test. Whichever man behaves better on the links should be promoted to the position. Alexander thanks him for the idea. After he mentions the men are named Holmes and Dixon, the Oldest Member regrets having given advice before hearing the names. He is fond of Mitchell, though Mitchell is apt to lose his temper when playing golf, while Rupert Dixon is supercilious and unpleasant but suave on the golf course.\n\nThe Oldest Member tells Mitchell that Alexander Paterson will test him by playing golf with him. He pretends it was Alexander's idea. Millicent buys a self-improvement book about controlling emotions called \"Are You Your Own Master?\", which is simply a collection of quotations from Marcus Aurelius sold under a different name. Alexander first tests Rupert Dixon, who does not lose his temper and wins the match. When Mitchell plays with Alexander, the Oldest Member and Millicent also come to provide moral support. Alexander plays very slowly, which irritates Mitchell. Millicent reads quotations from her book to encourage Mitchell to stay calm, which helps somewhat, especially while Mitchell is winning. However, Mitchell becomes overconfident and loses his lead, which makes him nervous. He loses a ball in the rough and loses his temper, claiming that the Greens Committee add rough to profit from retrieving and sell lost balls. The Oldest Member tries to defend him and tells Alexander that his slow method of playing was a trifle upsetting to Mitchell. Millicent leaves to avoid making Mitchell nervous, so the Oldest Member takes up the book to reads out quotations, but Mitchell is distracted by his caddie eating an apple and loses his temper again. He concedes the match. To his surprise, Alexander offers him the position of treasurer, since he knows he can always beat Mitchell at golf just by playing slowly and making him lose his temper.\n\n\nAfter a young man complains about players who use rules to try to disqualify opponents, the Oldest Member says that rules must be followed and is reminded of a story. He notes that the story is similar at first to the events of \"A Woman is Only a Woman\", but it develops quite differently.\n\nRalph Bingham and Arthur Jukes (US: Rollo Bingham and Otis Jukes) are already unfriendly rivals before they meet Amanda Trivett, but once they do, they fall in love in her and despise each other. Ralph and Arthur are both skilled at golf to an equal degree, handsome, and arrogant. When neither of them attracts Amanda's attention, they believe it is because they are keeping each other from having a chance to woo her, so they agree to a contest at golf. The winner will have the chance to court Amanda without competition. Ralph wants the Oldest Member to be one of the judges and follow Jukes during the match with a rule book, while the other judge and a friend of the Oldest Member, Rupert Bailey, follows Ralph. The match will consist of a single long hole. They will start at dawn on the club's first tee, and hole out in the town in the doorway of the Majestic Hotel in Royal Square (US: Hotel Astor in Times Square). It is a distance of about sixteen miles, which will prevent either from winning just by being lucky. They will all have bicycles. The Oldest Member disapproves, thinking freak matches like this are travesties on the sacred game, but thinks it will be historic anyway and agrees.\n\nIn the beginning of the match, Ralph gets ahead by chipping his ball aboard a boat he moored on the lake and rowing it to the other side. Arthur protests, stating the boat is a hazard, but Ralph points out that there is nothing in the rules against moving a hazard. The Oldest Member dislikes both players, but sympathizes with Arthur. Arthur reaches the road after Ralph and tries to play straight while covering distance as the Oldest Member cheerfully watches. Later, they all take a break at a garage. Arthur hits his ball into the only working car and pays the driver five pounds (US: twenty dollars) for a ride to Royal Square, planning to open the car door once he gets there and chip the ball out. Ralph does not protest, because Arthur would forfeit the match by opening the car door, since it is against the rules to tamper with a hazard. The Oldest Member realizes this and warns Arthur. At Royal Square, people on the street watch Arthur try unsuccessfully to hit his ball out of the car. Ralph and Rupert arrive. Ralph's score is close to Arthur's since a dog grabbed his ball and took it back some distance. Rupert wants breakfast before they continue, and everyone agrees. Afterwards, they find the car gone. Ralph bought it and paid the driver to take it to Glasgow (Boston in the US version). Ralph claims Arthur is disqualified since he cannot reach his ball in five minutes, while Arthur claims that Ralph is disqualified because he (jokingly) asked a bystander for golfing advice. Amanda happens to come out of the hotel. They ask Amanda to decide who was disqualified first. Amanda is not sure but she offers to ask her fiancé, who is very good at golf. Ralph and Arthur are stunned and tell her it doesn't matter.\n\n\nThe Oldest Member says that golf is an uncertain game and it is never safe to bet on any player. This leads to him telling the following story of Vincent Jopp, the American multi-millionaire, who played golf for only one season.\n\nIn the story, the Oldest Member is a young man who has just come down from Cambridge. He secures the job of secretary to Vincent Jopp and goes with him to Chicago. The Oldest Member types Jopp's appointments in a ledger and notices that Jopp wrote \"Propose to Amelia\" under May 3rd. The Oldest Member is not surprised by this, since Jopp has divorced three times. What is more remarkable is that the extremely confident Jopp also wrote \"Marry Amelia\" under June 1st. However, on May 4th, Jopp says nothing about Amelia. Instead, he asks his secretary for information on golf, including who the best professional golfer is. The Oldest Member tells him Scottish golfer Sandy McHoots won both British and American Open events last year. Jopp tells him to have McHoots brought from Scotland to Chicago to teach Jopp golf. Jopp, as confident as ever, plans to win the Amateur Championship on September 12th and marry Amelia on the 13th. He also becomes a member of the Wissahickey Glen, a club to which the Oldest Member belongs.\n\nMcHoots teaches Jopp golf. Jopp commits his tips to memory and approaches the game scientifically, recognizing errors and avoiding them. He rapidly becomes a very skilled player. He wins smaller competitions and is considered to be the probable winner of the American Amateur Championship, held that year in Detroit. The Oldest Member accompanies his employer there as both secretary and caddie. Amelia Merridew meets the Oldest Member. She explains that Jopp asked her to marry him, but she does not want to, so she said she would marry him if he won this year's Amateur Championship, thinking it would be impossible. She asks the Oldest Member to shout at him while he is golfing to distract him, but he refuses, since he has a bet on Jopp to win. Later, he gets a telephone call from each of Jopp's former wives, who say they will be on the course tomorrow to see Jopp play the final. He mentions this to Jopp, who seems nervous for the first time. Jopp plays well until the three Mrs Jopps appear: Luella Mainprice Jopp, who talks baby-talk to her Pekingese dog, Agnes Parsons Jopp, who fusses about Jopp's health, and Jane Jukes Jopp, who makes fun of how Jopp looks wearing knickerbockers. They make Jopp anxious and he loses the match. The Oldest Member, who lost his wager on Jopp, concludes that there are no safe bets in golf.\n\n\nEunice Waters stops by the club with her baby. Eunice is married to Ramsden Waters, who is away seeing her young brother Wilberforce off on the train to school in Scotland. The Oldest Member tells the story of how Eunice and Ramsden came to be married.\n\nRamsden Waters is shy and plays golf by himself. One morning, a boy calls out at him while he is golfing and causes him to mis-hit a ball. The boy is Wilberforce, and he is accompanied by his older sister, the beautiful and haughty Eunice Bray. She says that Wilberforce enjoys watching golf, and for her sake, Ramsden invites Wilberforce to come round with him. He finds out from Wilberforce that Eunice is not engaged to be married. After playing golf, he returns Wilberforce to Eunice, who has been reading a novel, and she thanks him without looking up from her book. Ramsden, who looks like a chump according to the Oldest Member, has little hope of courting Eunice. He calls at her home, but his multiple handsome rivals take up Eunice's attention while he talks with her seaweed-collecting aunt. One day, Eunice takes up golf, mainly because her rival Kitty Manders won a small silver cup at a monthly handicap and keeps bringing it up in conversation. Eunice takes lessons and soon acquires some skill in the game. She is paired with Ramsden in the annual mixed foursomes. Ramsden looks on this as a sign and proposes to her. Eunice refuses and tells him to play well in the foursomes because she wants to win.\n\nAt the competition, their only real threat is a skilled golfer named Marcella Bingley, who is paired with the less impressive George Perkins. Like Eunice, Ramsden wants to win the competition and talks to her earnestly without any diffidence, telling her to play steadily and not try fancy shots. Eunice is surprised and annoyed by the change in Ramsden's manner. Throughout the match, Ramsden tells her how she should play. At first, she is offended and ignores him, but her feelings change when she realizes that he reminds her of the rugged, domineering heroes in the romance novels she reads. Eunice has wanted to meet such a man. She plays worse than Ramsden and is humbled. Ramsden makes a mistake and kicks Wilberforce after he laughs at him. Ramsden and Eunice lose the match, and Ramsden coldly strides off, again reminding Eunice of romance novels. That night, Ramsden is no longer affected by golf and reproaches himself for alienating Eunice. However, he gets a telephone call from her. She invites him to come see her to discuss marriage.\n\n\nIn the story's prologue, an author humbly approaches a regal editor and offers his historical story. The editor says the public does not want historical stories, and that the magazine needs stories with warm human interest and a strong love-motive. At the moment, the editor needs a golf story. The author says that his work is just what the editor is looking for, and presents the following story.\n\nKing Merolchazzar of Oom has heard good things about the Princess of the Outer Isles and hopes to court her. He sent her gifts and asked to meet her. She receives the gifts but simply says she will let him know later. He has not heard from her since then and is disappointed. Later, in his gardens, he notices a Scottish gardener hitting a rounded stone with a hoe. The King asks his Grand Vizier what the man is doing. The Vizier believes it is some sort of religious ceremony done to propitiate a deity named Gowf, who is not among Oom's sixty-seven deities. The King is fascinated by the religion of Gowf. He learns how to play golf from the gardener. Some members of the king's court arrange for minstrels to play for him to cheer him up after being ignored by the Princess, but they only annoy the King while he is trying to hit the ball. Word spreads that the King has become an adherent of a new religion. Merolchazzar now spends most of his time on the Linx, as the outdoor temple of the new god is called. The gardener is given riches and the title of Promoter of the King's Happiness, or The Pro for short. The Grand Vizier is loyal to the King and takes to Gowf right away, but the priesthood, especially the influential High Priest of Hec, resist the new religion.\n\nThe King's half-brother, Ascobaruch, wants the King's position for himself and plots against him with the High Priest. According to their plan, the High Priest will assassinate the King while Ascobaruch is away on a trip, and Ascobaruch will become the new monarch when he returns. The High Priest goes to the Linx, but before he can do anything, the King gives him a stick and tells him to play. A month later, Ascobaruch returns from his trip and finds that golf is now widespread. Plus, due to a law passed by the King, all his subjects speak with a Scottish accent, like the Pro. After seeing the King and Vizier playing a foursome against the Pro and the Highest Priest of Hec, Ascobaruch gives up and leaves. One day, the beautiful Princess of the Outer Isles visits the King. She did not send him a message before because she was busy, her subjects having recently converted to the religion of Gowf. The King says that the same thing has happened in Oom. They bond over their love of golf and walk hand in hand into the palace.\n\nUltimately, the editor accepts the story. He tells his majordomo to give the man a purse of gold and then throw him out.\n\nThe book has a long dedication beginning with: \"To the Immortal Memory of John Henrie and Pat Rogie\".

{"id": "1888937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888937", "title": "Whitewall tire", "text": "Whitewall tire\n\nWhitewall tires or white sidewall (WSW) tires are tires having a stripe or entire sidewall of white rubber. These tires were most commonly used from the early 1900s to around the mid 1970s.\n\nThe use of whitewall rubber for tire has been traced to a small tire company in Chicago called Vogue Tyre and Rubber Co that made them for their horse and chauffeur drawn carriages in 1914.\n\nEarly automobile tires were made of pure natural rubber with various chemicals mixed into the tread compounds to make them wear better. The best of these was zinc oxide, a pure white substance that increased traction and also made the entire tire white. However, the white rubber did not offer sufficient endurance, so carbon black was added to the rubber to greatly increase tread life. Using carbon black only in the tread produced tires with inner and outer sidewalls of white rubber. Later, entirely black tires became available, the still extant white sidewalls being covered with a somewhat thin, black colored layer of rubber. Should a black sidewall tire have been severely scuffed against a curb, the underlying white rubber would be revealed; it is in a similar manner that raised white letter (RWL) tires are made.\n\nThe status of whitewall tires versus blackwall tires was originally the reverse of what it later became, with fully black tires requiring a greater amount of carbon black and less effort to maintain a clean appearance these were considered the premium tire; since the black tires first became available they were commonly fitted to many luxury cars through the 1930s. During the late-1920s gleaming whitewalls contrasted against darker surroundings were considered a stylish, but high-maintenance feature. The popularity of whitewalls as an option increased during the 1930s. On April 6, 1934, Ford introduced whitewall tires as an $11.25 option on all its new cars. But automobile designs incorporating streamlining directed visual interest away from tire walls.\n\nThe availability of whitewall tires was limited in the U.S. during the supply shortages of raw materials during World War II and the Korean War.\n\nWide whitewall tires reached their height in popularity by the early-1950s. The 1957 production version of the Cadillac Eldorado Brougham was fitted with whitewalls that were reduced to a 1\" wide stripe floating on the tire sidewall with a black area between this stripe and the wheel rim. The whitewall stripe width began to diminish as an attempt to reduce the perceived height of the wheel/tire. During the decade, increasingly lower vehicle heights were in vogue. During the 1950s, Fender skirts also covered up white wall tires.\n\nWide whitewalls generally fell out of favor in the U.S. by the 1962 model year. They continued as an option on the Lincoln Continental for some time thereafter but most common were narrower 3/4\"-1\" stripe whitewalls. During the mid-1960s variations on the striped whitewall began to appear; a red/white stripe combination was offered on Thunderbirds and other high-end Fords, and triple white stripe variations were offered on Cadillacs, Lincolns, and Imperials. Whitewall tires were a popular option on new cars during the 1950s and 1960s, as well as in the replacement market. In some cases, having whitewall tires were a \"must have\" to get the right look on a car; and for those who could not afford the real deal, add-ons could be installed over the rim of the wheel that could leak if the pressure was too high.\n\nNew tires were wrapped in paper for shipping, to keep the white stripe clean, and for preventing the black of other tires from rubbing on the whitewall side. Maintaining a clean sidewall was an issue. Some motorists added aftermarket \"curb feelers\" that were attached at the bottom of the wheel opening lip to help reduce scraping the whitewall tire against curbs.\n\nBy 1968, wide whitewall tires were no longer available on the Chevrolet Corvette; replaced by F70x15 bias-ply nylon cord tires with thin stripes, either a narrow white or narrow red stripe.\n\nThe single-sided whitewall remained a desirable option through the 1970s, becoming a hallmark of \"traditional luxury\". Radial tires made by Vogue Tyre featured a narrow whitewall with a thin gold stripe line toward the edge of the tire. They were most often fitted to luxury cars.\n\nFull-fledged wide whitewalls had made a return within the modified car culture. The resurgence of traditional hot rods, customs, retro, lowriders and resto-cal cars have also contributed to the resurgence in whitewall tires.\n\nAlthough wide whitewalls are virtually nonexistent as a factory option on modern automobiles, they are still manufactured in original bias-ply or radial form by specialty outlets such as Coker Tire and Vogue Tyre. The last car available in the United Kingdom with whitewall tires was the Kia Pride. Some companies manufacture wide whitewall inserts - the so-called \"Portawall\" inserts are usually sold through Volkswagen Beetle restoration companies. Another modern incarnation has been tire decals, which can be applied to a normal tire to give the whitewall look.\n\nModern trends toward more minimal styling, and large wheels favoring very low-profile tires leave little room for a whitewall. The Lincoln Town Car continued to be offered with a factory whitewall option – a narrow white stripe – until its discontinuation in 2010. It is not currently offered as a factory option by any car manufacturer, but it is possible to order white walls for motorcycles (for example, the Indian Chief 2014).\n\nCars with whitewall tires: \n"}

It is similar to the emblem of the previous Uzbek SSR.

Prior to 1992, Uzbekistan had an emblem similar to all other Soviet Republics.\n\nThe emblem is in the form of a circle and mainly bears the national colors blue, white, and green, replacing the Soviet motto \"Workers of the world, unite!\" where the red ribbon previously stood.

Spacely's rival, Cogswell, has been stealing Spacely's business ideas - putting their jobs in jeopardy. Spacely wrongfully blames George - suspecting that he was spying for Cogswell. Spacely orders George to spy on Cogswell to clear his name to avoid getting fired. George finds out that Cogswell's robot computer, S.A.R.A., has been seducing the Spacely robot computer, R.U.D.I., into leaking Mr. Spacely's secrets. George tries to report this to Spacely, but R.U.D.I. sabotages his efforts.\n\nIn the Stone Age, Wilma and Betty are trying to convince Fred Flintstone to have their vacation in Honolurock (Honolulu), but Fred ignores their advances. Later, at work, Fred tells Barney Rubble that he plans to take the girls someplace better. He tells Barney that a poker tournament is being held at the Water Buffalo lodge and wants to go, but Mr. Slate shows up and tells them that due to their going on vacation, they must work the late shift because Turk Tarpit, Slate's business rival and nemesis, has been outproducing them. Fred and Barney later disobey Slate's orders and go to the poker tournament. However, after seeing that Slate is playing there too, they disguise themselves. Fred plays against Slate but loses. A spider exposes Barney - and ultimately Fred. Furious that they deceived and disobeyed him, Slate fires Fred and Barney.\n\nBack in the future, Elroy completes his time machine. The Jetsons decide to use it to take a trip to the 25th century to relax. Right before Elroy gets the machine working, his dog, Astro, accidentally sets the switch to \"Past.\"\n\nWith no job, the Flintstones and Rubbles are forced to settle for a camping holiday. As Fred and Barney set up the tent, the Jetsons arrive from the future. Fred and George eventually communicate, and the families become friends. Fred is amazed by George's futuristic gadgets and decides to use them to help Mr. Slate in a competition at the upcoming company picnic. Fred introduces George to Slate - claiming that George is a distant cousin. Slate is reluctant at first to trust George, but since rival businessman Turk Tarpit's cheating has set him back, Slate accepts their help in exchange for giving them their jobs back. George and Fred use future technology to help Slate win several games, but in the last event, Astro's and Dino's actions causes Tarpit to become the winner. In the end, Slate once again fires Fred and Barney.\n\nWhile Mr. Spacely continues to vent over his failing business, Henry Orbit and Rosie the Robot Maid assemble a \"time machine retriever\" to bring the Jetsons back. But when they turn it on, the time machine returns with the Flintstones instead. Upon seeing they really are cavemen, Spacely introduces them to the press.\n\nStuck in the past, George asks Mr. Slate for a job. Slate initially rejects, but when Tarpit offers George work, Slate immediately makes George his partner, and George soon becomes famous. Using their newfound fame and riches, the Jetsons buy multiple local businesses and are soon overwhelmed. Meanwhile, Mr. Spacely makes Fred the spokesman for his company, but R.U.D.I. leaks this information to S.A.R.A. When Spacely is introducing Fred to some important investors, Cogswell introduces Barney instead - leading to a rift in Fred's and Barney's friendship.

Mr. Spacely concocts a plan to use Fred's car as a model for futuristic replicas. Cogswell sends his robotic dog, Sentro, to steal this information since S.A.R.A. is no longer useful when she tells him that R.U.D.I. broke up with her and told her off. The two families manage to stop Sentro - destroying the evidence he had collected. Spacely's business of selling Stone Age style cars becomes successful, and he even agrees to sell one to Cogswell - but not without warning Cogswell that if he copies any part of it, Spacely will sue him and take over his business.

His best known work, \"As a Man Thinketh\", has been mass-produced since its publication in 1903. It has been a source of inspiration to motivational and self-help authors.\n\nBorn in Leicester, England, into a working-class family, Allen was the elder of two brothers. His mother could neither read nor write. His father, William, was a factory knitter. In 1879, following a downturn in the textile trade of central England, Allen's father travelled alone to America to find work and establish a new home for the family. Within two days of arriving his father was pronounced dead at New York City Hospital, believed to be a case of robbery and murder. At age fifteen, with the family now facing economic disaster, Allen was forced to leave school and find work.\n\nFor much of the 1890s, Allen worked as a private secretary and stationer in several British manufacturing firms. In 1893 Allen moved to London and later to South Wales, earning his living by journalism and reporting. In South Wales he met Lily Louisa Oram (Lily L. Allen) whom he then wed in 1895. In 1898 Allen found an occupation in which he could showcase his spiritual and social interests as a writer for the magazine The Herald of the Golden Age. At this time, Allen entered a creative period where he then published his first of many books, \"From Poverty to Power\" (1901). In 1902 Allen began to publish his own spiritual magazine, \"The Light of Reason\", later retitled \"The Epoch\".\n\nIn 1903, Allen published his third and most famous book \"As a Man Thinketh\". Loosely based on the Biblical passage of Proverbs 23:7, \"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he,\" the small work eventually became read around the world and brought Allen posthumous fame as one of the pioneering figures of modern inspirational thought. The book's minor audience allowed Allen to quit his secretarial work and pursue his writing and editing career. In 1903, the Allen family retired to the town of Ilfracombe where Allen would spend the rest of his life. Continuing to publish the Epoch, Allen produced more than one book per year until his death in 1912. There he wrote for nine years, producing 19 works.\n\nFollowing his death in 1912, his wife continued publishing the magazine under the name \"The Epoch\". Lily Allen summarised her husband's literary mission in the preface to one of his posthumously published manuscripts, \"Foundation Stones to Happiness and Success\" saying:\n\n\"He never wrote theories, or for the sake of writing; but he wrote when he had a message, and it became a message only when he had lived it out in his own life, and knew that it was good. Thus he wrote facts, which he had proven by practice.\"\n\n\n"}

They primarily licensed programs from independent producers, rather than producing their own content.\n\nIn spring 1954, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. created the ABC Films Syndication, Inc. (AFS), a subsidiary headed by George Shupert, which specialized in syndication and in-house program production. By , AFS formed a 50/50 joint venture production company, Rabco Productions, with Hal Roach, Jr..\n\nIn , AFS announced an expansion in production and sales staff for the year. Five new properties were acquired by the company and all received pilots, with two set for syndication if not placed nationally. Two were to be produced by John Gibbs and Meridian Pictures, \"Renfrew of the Mounted\" and \"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\", while Rabco's Bernard Fox was assigned with \"Forest Ranger\". The two pilots set for production were \"The Americano\" by Martin Gosch and filmed in Spain and \"The Force\" produced by Victor Stoloff about the plain clothed Canadian Mounties division. Two shows, \"Code 3\" and \"The Three Musketeers\" were already under production for syndication. One of AFS's earliest successes was \"Sheena, Queen of the Jungle\", produced largely in Mexico by Nassour Studios and starring Irish McCalla as the comic-book heroine. Even though only 26 episodes were filmed, the series ran for years in reruns on local stations, in kiddie-show time slots.\n\nIn 1959, ABC International created Worldvision Enterprises to syndicate programs for overseas markets. Henry G. Plitt, previously president of Paramount Gulf Theatres, became president of the company in February 1959, replacing Shupert after he left for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Kevin O’Sullivan later became president of the company.\n\nIn 1971, the FCC barred the participation of networks in the syndication of their own programs, though this rule was eliminated by 1993. Worldvision Enterprises was formed by five former ABC Films executives to purchase the network's syndication assets in 1973.\n\nTheir home video division released numerous Hanna-Barbera titles and Jack Nicklaus' \"Golf My Way\" instructional video series. They were also responsible for the television distribution of a majority of the Carolco Pictures feature film library (inherited from Orbis Communications, which was a division of Carolco before the studio went bankrupt).\n\nWorldvision has been owned by many companies over the years. The growth of its home video division was primarily under the ownership of Taft Broadcasting, which acquired the company in 1979. In October 1987, Taft's assets including Worldvision were acquired by Great American Communications. During the mid-1990s, Blockbuster Inc., operator of the now-defunct video store chain, briefly held a controlling interest in the company, and its logo appeared on programs alongside Worldvision's.\n\nTelevision producer Aaron Spelling, attempting to find an outlet to distribute his programs, attempted to buy Worldvision from Great American, but chief company shareholder Carl H. Lindner told Spelling that he was not interested in selling the company. Lindner did agree to sell Worldvision to Spelling Productions for 50% of Spelling, Inc., the combined company, in 1988. The merger was finalized on March 1, 1989.\n\nThe company put its \"Worldvision 3\" movie package on the market at NAPTE in January 1993. Worldvision 3 was the first since Spelling Entertainment's acquisition of the Carolco library. Some of the movies in the package were \"Chaplin\", \"Basic Instinct\", \"L.A. Story\", \"Rambling Rose\", \"\" and \"Universal Soldier\". \n\nIn August 1994, Worldvision's Spelling Premiere Network was launched. The network's initial years shows were \"Robin's Hoods\", \"Heaven Help Us\", and \"University Hospital\", Heaven's mid-season replacement.\n\nIn 1994, Worldvision's home video division was folded into Republic Pictures's Home Video division after Spelling Entertainment's purchase of Republic in the same year.\n\nWhen Spelling Entertainment Group merged with Viacom on May 26, 1999, Worldvision's operations were folded into Paramount Domestic Television. Today, the former Worldvision Enterprises productions are all owned by ViacomCBS thru CBS Television Distribution.\n\nIn December 2019, CBS Corporation and Viacom remerged into a single entity under the name ViacomCBS, which reunited the former Worldvision Enterprises assets.\n\nThe company's logo, as it appeared at the end of the programs it distributed, carried the following disclaimer: \"Not affiliated with World Vision International, a religious and charitable organization.\" This was because, in the mid-1970s, the charity sued the company for its use of the \"Worldvision\" name, which eventually led to trademark infringement. They eventually settled, with Worldvision allowed to continue using the name for the syndication company, provided that a disclaimer was included to distance itself from World Vision International, which was implemented starting in 1974.\n"}

Celestion Radio Company and Celestion Limited formed in 1927, and two years later the company moved across the Thames to Kingston. The company grew rapidly, but was hit by the depression. Wartime restrictions forced Celestion and the nearby British Rola Company to produce loudspeakers to the same specification; British Rola bought Celestion in 1947 and moved production to Thames Ditton a year later. The name of the company changed to \"Rola Celestion\"; with its products sold under the brand name \"Celestion\". (MPP, later a camera maker, was formed as a subsidiary during the war.)\n\nThe company continued making radio, television, and \"hi fi\" speakers in the postwar years. Rola Celestion was bought by Truvox, a public address system manufacturer, in 1949.\n\nIn 1968 the company started production in Ipswich, moving all production there by 1975. The company merged with a clothing company in 1970 and the result was named Celestion Industries, which in turn became Celestion International in 1979.\n\nIn 1992 the loudspeaker part of the business was sold to Kinergetics Holdings, which also bought KEF.\nToday Celestion International and KEF form GP Acoustics UK. In 2006 Celestion ceased to manufacture finished pro audio systems, and hi-fi/home theatre products, and now focuses on the design and manufacture of lead guitar, bass guitar, and professional audio sound reinforcement speakers.\n\nIn 1982, Celestion built the SL6, a compact hi-fi speaker with a metal dome tweeter made of copper and designed with the help of laser interferometry. They followed this model with the SL600, which used a rigid honeycomb alloy called Aerolam instead of wood for the speaker casing, a material previously used only in the aerospace industry. Both these speaker models, while well regarded, are known for a somewhat \"depressed\" sounding high-frequency range from the relatively heavy copper dome tweeter. Later versions used an aluminium dome—a lighter and more efficient driver that provided an output more balanced with the woofer. The aluminium-domed versions, in the standard cabinet (MDF and wood veneer) were designated as the SL6s, and then (with an improved crossover and woofer surround) the SL6si. Aluminium-domed models using the Aerolam cabinet were designated as the SL700 and the SL700SE with dual inputs. Another version of the copper-domed model, with both the Aerolam cabinet and improved crossover elements, was marketed as the SL600si, also with dual inputs.\n\nIn 1992, Celestion produced the final variation of this design, as the Ten Year \"Anniversary Edition\" Model 100, which featured a conventional, but highly refined MDF / wood veneer cabinet, dual inputs, updated mounted plates, an improved crossover, the improved woofer design, and a variation of the aluminium tweeter with an updated faceplate.\n\nThe company says that the Celestion Blue was the world's first dedicated guitar loudspeaker. The 1950s emergence of louder guitar amplifiers created a need for a rugged, reliable loudspeaker. Celestion responded by modifying their standard \"G12\" radio speaker. The tonal character, combined with valve amp circuits of the time, helped to define the electric guitar sound. It was rapidly adopted by pioneers of rock & roll and popular music throughout the late 50s and early 60s. The \n\nA number of companies use Celestion speakers, including Orange Music Electronic Company, Fender Musical Instrument Corporation, Vox, and Marshall Amps.\n\nIn June 2019, Celestion selected Sensey Electronics as its distribution partner in Mexico, to represent its entire range of pro audio and MI products.\n\nIn September 2019, Celestion announced the launch of the F12-X200 guitar loudspeaker, the first speaker designer specifically for use with profiling amps, modeling software, impulse responses and other technologies which are designed for emulating the tones from guitar amps and speaker cabinets.\n\n"}
{"id": "1889033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889033", "title": "Prophecy of Seventy Weeks", "text": "Prophecy of Seventy Weeks\n\nIn the Bible, the Prophecy of Seventy Weeks (chapter 9 of the Book of Daniel) is a prophecy given to Daniel by the angel Gabriel in response to Daniel's prayer for God to act on behalf of his people and city (i.e. Jerusalem). The angel informs him that seventy \"weeks\" have been decreed for them, and then gives a detailed but cryptic description of those weeks.\n\nThe prophecy has proved notoriously difficult for readers, despite it having been the subject of \"intense exegetical activity\" since the Second Temple period. For this reason scholars continue to follow James Alan Montgomery in referring to the history of this prophecy's interpretation as the \"dismal swamp\" of critical exegesis.\n\nDaniel reads in the \"books\" that the desolation of Jerusalem must last for seventy years according to the prophetic words of Jeremiah (verse 2), and prays for God to act on behalf of his people and city (verses 3–19). The angel Gabriel appears and tells Daniel that he has come to give wisdom and understanding, for at the beginning of Daniel's prayer a \"word\" went out and Gabriel has come to declare this revelation (verses 20–23):\n\nThe consensus among critical scholars is that chapters 1–6 of the Book of Daniel originated as a collection of folktales among the Jewish diaspora in the Persian/Hellenistic periods, to which the visionary chapters 7–12 were added during the persecution of the Jews under Antiochus IV in 167–163 BCE. The authors of the tales apparently took the name Daniel from a legendary hero mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel, and the author of the visions in turn adopted him from the tales. The point of departure is Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy as opposed to a visionary episode, but more than half the chapter is devoted to a rather lengthy prayer.\n\nModern critical scholars have sometimes argued that Daniel's prayer in verses 3–19 is secondary to chapter 9, as it contrasts sharply with the difficult Hebrew that is characteristic of Daniel. Still, it might be that the author(s) of the chapter incorporated (or adapted) a traditional prayer in the course of composition, in which case the prayer would not be a later addition. Proponents of the view that the prayer is secondary argue that (1) the context requires a prayer of illumination and not a communal confession of sin, and (2) the beginning and end of the prayer are marked by duplications in verses 3-4a and verses 20-21a that are most plausibly interpreted as redactional seams. However, these considerations have not proved decisive, and arguments in favor of the prayer's authenticity have also been advanced. In particular, the concluding passage in verses 20–27 contains several allusions to the language in the prayer, suggesting that it was included purposefully by the author(s) of the chapter, even if it was not originally composed by them.\n\nIt has also been argued that there is a \"pre-Maccabean core\" to the prophetic revelation delivered by Gabriel in verses 24–27, and that certain linguistic inconsistencies between the seventy weeks prophecy and other Danielic passages suggest that the second century BCE author(s)/redactor(s) of the Book of Daniel took over and modified a preexisting oracle that was already in circulation at the time of composition. These ideas have been further developed to suggest that the different redactional layers represented in this text reflect different eschatological perspectives, with the earliest one going back to a priest named Daniel who accompanied Ezra from Babylon to Jerusalem in the fifth century BCE and the latest one to an unnamed redactor who edited this prophecy in the second century BCE so that it would function (along with other parts of the Book of Daniel) as part of \"a prophetic manifesto for world domination.\" It is also argued that the prophecy exhibited a high degree of literary structure at an earlier stage of its development in such a way that the six infinitival clauses of verse 24 were chiastically linked to six divisions of verses 25–27 via an elaborate system of word counts, resulting in the following reconstruction of this earlier redactional stratum:\n\nThe seventy weeks prophecy is an \"ex eventu\" prophecy in periodized form whose \"Sitz im Leben\" is the Antiochene crisis in the second century BCE, with content analogous to the Enochic \"Apocalypse of Weeks\" as well as the \"Animal Apocalypse\". In this way, the prophecy puts the Antiochene crisis in perspective by locating it within an overview of history; the specificity of the prediction is significant for the psychological effect of the revelation, which has long been recognized as a distinctive characteristic of Daniel's prophecies (cf. \"Ant.\" 10.11.7 § 267). The prophecy is also an instance of Jewish apocalyptic literature, as it belongs to the genre of revelatory literature in which a revelation is mediated to a human recipient in Daniel by an otherworldly being in the angel Gabriel that envisages eschatological salvation. Within the macro-genre of Jewish apocalyptic literature, the prophecy further belongs to the subgenre known as the \"historical apocalypse,\" which is characterized by the use of \"ex eventu\" prophecy and the presence of an interpreting angel.\n\nThe lengthy prayer in verses 3–19 is strongly Deuteronomic in its theology—Daniel's people are punished for their own sin and appeal to God for mercy. However, such theological overtones conflict with other aspects of the Book of Daniel, in which the primary sin is that of a gentile king and the course of history is arranged in advance. Consequently, scholars have variously argued that the angel ignores Daniel's prayer and that the author(s) is making the point that \"the calamity is decreed and will end at the appointed time, quite apart from prayers,\" and/or that the prayer is not intended to influence God but is \"an act of piety in itself.\" As Collins observes, \"[t]he deliverance promised by the angel is in no sense a response to Daniel's prayer\" since \"[t]he word goes forth at the beginning of Daniel's supplication.\" In any case, the relationship between Daniel's prayer and the context in which it is placed, is a central issue in the contemporary scholarly interpretation of chapter 9.\n\nNebuchadnezzar II defeated Egypt at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BCE and established Babylon as the dominant regional power, with significant consequences for the southern kingdom of Judah. Following a revolt in 597 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar removed Judah's king, Jehoiachin; and after a second revolt in 586 BCE, he destroyed the city of Jerusalem along with the Temple of Solomon, carrying away much of the population to Babylon. Accordingly, the subsequent period from 586 BCE to 538 BCE is known as the Babylonian exile, which came to an end when Babylon was conquered by the Persian king Cyrus the Great, who allowed the Jewish exiles to return to Judah via his famous edict of restoration. The Persian period, in turn, came to an end in the first half of the fourth century BCE following the arrival of Alexander the Great, whose vast kingdom was divided upon his death among the Diadochi. The series of conflicts that ensued following Alexander's death in the wars that erupted among the Diadochi mark the beginning of the Hellenistic period in 323/2 BCE. Two of the rival kingdoms produced out of this conflict—the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt and the Seleucid dynasty in Syria—fought for control of Palestine during the Hellenistic period.\n\nAt the start of the second century BCE, the Seleucids had the upper hand in their struggle with the Ptolemaic kingdom for regional dominance, but the earlier conflicts had left them nearly bankrupt. The Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV attempted to recoup some of his kingdom's fortunes by selling the post of Jewish high priest to the highest bidder, and in 171/0 BCE the existing high priest (i.e. Onias III) was deposed and murdered. Palestine was subsequently divided between those who favored the Hellenistic culture of the Seleucids and those who remained loyal to the older Jewish traditions; however, for reasons that are still not understood, Antiochus IV banned key aspects of traditional Jewish religion in 168/7 BCE—including the twice-daily continual offering (cf. ; ; ).\n\nThe seventy weeks prophecy is internally dated to \"the first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus, by birth a Mede\" (verse 1), elsewhere referred to within the Book of Daniel as \"Darius the Mede\" (e.g. ); however, no such ruler is known to history independently of the Book of Daniel and the widespread consensus among critical scholars is that he is a literary fiction. Nevertheless, within the fictionalized biblical account, the first year of Darius the Mede corresponds to the first year after the Babylonian kingdom is overthrown, i.e., 538 BCE.\n\nChapter 9 can be distinguished from the other \"visionary\" chapters of the Book of Daniel by the fact that the point of departure for this chapter is another biblical text in Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy and not a visionary episode. The longstanding consensus among critical scholars has been that verses 24–27 is a paradigmatic example of inner-biblical interpretation, in which the latter text reinterprets Jeremiah's seventy years of exile as seventy weeks of years. On this view, Jeremiah's prophecy that after seventy years God would punish the Babylonian kingdom (cf. ) and once again pay special attention to his people in responding to their prayers and restoring them to the land (cf. -14) could not have been fulfilled by the disappointment that accompanied the return to the land in the Persian period, hence the necessity to extend the expiration date of the prophecy to the second century BCE. And just as various elements of Daniel's visionary episodes are interpreted for him in chapters 7–8, so also Jeremiah's prophecy is interpreted for him in a manner similar to the \"pesher\" exegesis evidenced at Qumran in chapter 9. However, this consensus has recently been challenged on the grounds that Daniel prays to God following the defeat of the Babylonian kingdom precisely because Jeremiah's seventy years of exile have been completed and God promised through the prophet that he would respond to such prayers at this time, in which case the seventy weeks prophecy is not a reinterpretation of Jeremiah's prophecy but a separate prophecy altogether. And these considerations have been further refined along redactional lines to suggest that the latter holds relative to an earlier \"pre-canonical\" stage in the text, but that the seventy weeks prophecy is, in fact, a reinterpretation of Jeremiah's prophecy relative to the final form of the text.\n\nThe seventy \"weeks\" of years are divided into three groups: a seven-week period spanning forty-nine years, a sixty-two-week period spanning 434 years, and a final period of one week spanning seven years. The first seven weeks begin with the departure of a \"word\" to rebuild Jerusalem and ends with the arrival of an \"anointed prince\" (verse 25a); this \"word\" has generally been taken to refer to Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy and dated to the fourth year of Jehoiakim (or the first year of Nebuchadnezzar) in 605/4 BCE, but Collins objects that \"[t]he word to rebuild Jerusalem could scarcely have gone forth before it was destroyed,\" and prefers the \"word\" that Gabriel came to give Daniel in verse 23; other candidates include the edict of Cyrus in 539/8 BCE, the decree of Artaxerxes I in 458/7 BCE, and the warrant given to Nehemiah in 445/4 BCE. Candidates for the \"prince\" in verse 25a include Cyrus (cf. ), Joshua the High Priest, Zerubbabel, Sheshbazzar, Ezra, Nehemiah, the angelic \"prince\" Michael (cf. b), and even the collective people of God in the Second Temple period.\n\nIn the subsequent period of sixty-two weeks the city is rebuilt (verse 25b) and an \"anointed one shall be cut off\" (verse 26a); this \"anointed one\" is generally considered to refer to the High Priest Onias III, whose murder outside Jerusalem in 171/0 BCE is recorded in 2 Maccabees 4:23–28. Most critical scholars see another reference to Onias III's murder in Daniel 11:22, though Ptolemy VI and the infant son of Seleucus IV have also been suggested. On the other hand, this raises the question of how 7 + 62 = 69 weeks of years (or 483 years) could have elapsed between the departure of the \"word\" in verse 25a, which cannot be earlier than 605/4 BCE, and the murder of Onias III in 171/170 BCE. Hence, some critical scholars follow Montgomery in thinking that there has been \"a chronological miscalculation on [the] part of the writer\" who has made \"wrong-headed arithmetical calculations,\" although others follow Goldingay's explanation that the seventy weeks are not literal chronology but the more inexact science of \"chronography\"; Collins opts for a middle-ground position in saying that \"the figure should be considered a round number rather than a miscalculation.\" Others who see the calculations as being at least approximately correct if the initial seven-week period of forty-nine years can overlap with the sixty-two-week period of 434 years, with the latter period spanning the time between Jeremiah's prophecy in 605/4 BCE and Onias III's murder in 171/0 BCE.\n\nThe \"prince who is to come\" in verse 26b is typically seen by critical scholars as a reference to Antiochus IV, though Jason and Menelaus have also been suggested. Hence, the \"troops of the prince\" are thought to be either the Seleucid troops that settled in Jerusalem (cf. Dan 11:31; 1 Macc 1:29–40) or the Jewish hellenizers. The reference to \"troops\" that will \"destroy the city and the sanctuary\" in verse 26b is somewhat problematic since neither Jerusalem nor the temple were actually destroyed, though the city was arguably rendered desolate and the temple defiled (cf. 1 Macc 1:46; 2 Macc 6:2), and Daniel's language of destruction \"seems excessive\".\n\nThe \"covenant\" in verse 27a most likely refers to the covenant between the Jewish hellenizers and Antiochus IV reported in 1 Maccabees 1:11, with the ban on regular worship for a period that lasted approximately three and a half years alluded to in the subsequent clause (cf. Dan 7:25; 8:14; 12:11). The \"abomination that desolates\" in verse 27b (cf. 1 Macc 1:54) is usually seen as a reference to either the pagan sacrifices that relaced the twice-daily Jewishoffering,(cf. Dan 11:31; 12:11; 2 Macc 6:5), or the pagan altar on which such offerings were made.\n\nThere is a longstanding tradition within Christianity of reading Daniel 9 as a messianic prophecy fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The various christological readings that have been proposed share a number of features in common: Either the \"anointed prince\" in verse 25a or the \"anointed one\" in verse 26a (or both) are understood to be references to Christ, who is also sometimes thought to be the \"most holy\" that is anointed in verse 24 (so the Peshitta and the Vulgate). Some of the early church fathers also saw another reference to Christ in the \"prince who is to come\" (verse 26b), but this figure is more often identified with either the Antichrist or one of the Roman officials that oversaw the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE (e.g. Titus or Vespasian). \n\nThe seven and sixty-two-week \"weeks\" are most frequently understood for the purpose of Christological interpretation as consecutive, making up a period of 69 weeks (483 years) beginning with the decree given to Ezra by Artaxerxes I in 458/7 BCE (the \"terminus a quo\") and terminating with the baptism of Jesus. The reference to an anointed one being \"cut off\" in verse 26a is identified with the crucifixion of Jesus and has traditionally been thought to mark the midpoint of the seventieth week, which is also when Jeremiah's new \"covenant\" is \"confirmed\" (verse 27a) and atonement for \"iniquity\" (verse 24) is made. The \"abomination that desolates\" is typically read in the context of the New Testament references made to this expression in the Olivet Discourse and understood as belonging to a complex eschatological tableaux described therein, which may or may not remain to be fulfilled.\n\nAnother influential way of reading the prophecy follows Africanus in identifying the warrant given to Nehemiah in 445/4 BCE as the \"terminus a quo\". 483 years from 445/4 BCE would extend somewhat beyond the lifetime of Christ to 39/40 CE, hence some Christological interpretations reduce the period to 476 years by viewing them as 360-day \"prophetic years\" (or \"Chaldee years\" ), so-called on the basis that various biblical passages—such as Revelation 12:6, 14 (cf. Dan 7:25; 12:7)—appear to reckon time in this way in certain prophetic contexts. The sixty-nine weeks of \"prophetic\" years are then considered to terminate with the death of Christ in 32/3 CE. The seventieth week is then separated from the sixty-ninth week by a long period of time known as the church age; hence, the seventieth week does not begin until the end of the church age, at which point the church will be removed from the earth in an event called the rapture. Finally, the future Antichrist is expected to oppress the Jewish people and bring upon the world a period of tribulation lasting three and a half years, constituting the second half of the delayed seventieth week. These readings were first popularized through the expository notes written by C. I. Scofield in his Scofield Reference Bible and continue to enjoy support.\n\n\n\n"}

The June Rule 4 draft, known as simply \"the draft\", \"amateur draft\", or \"first year player draft\", is a distinctly different process in which teams select high school and college players.\n\nPrior to its current incarnation, from 1959 until the creation of the Rule 4 draft in 1965, top first-year prospects of teams were exposed to the Rule 5 draft. This was in some ways an outgrowth of the Bonus rule that existed from 1946 to 1950 and from 1953 to 1957.\n\nAs in the amateur draft, the selection order of the teams is based on each team's win-loss record from the prior regular season, each round starting with the team with the worst record and proceeding in order to the team with the best record. Teams may choose not to select any player with their pick, passing to the next team in the order. Any player selected under Rule 5 is immediately added to his new team's 40-man roster; thus, teams who do not have an available roster spot may not participate in the Rule 5 draft. Players who are not currently on their team's 40-man roster are eligible to be selected in the Rule 5 draft, but only after a standard exemption period has elapsed. See \"Selection eligibility\" below.\n\nIf chosen in the Rule 5 draft, a player must be kept on the selecting team's 26-man (prior to the 2020 season, 25-man) major league roster for the entire season that follows the draft—he may not be optioned or designated to the minors. The selecting team may, at any time, waive the Rule 5 draftee. If a Rule 5 draftee clears waivers by not signing with a new MLB team, he must be offered back to the original team, effectively canceling the Rule 5 draft choice. Once a Rule 5 draftee spends an entire season on his new team's 26-man roster, his status reverts to normal and he may be optioned or designated for assignment.\n\nTo prevent the abuse of the Rule 5 draft, the rule also states that the draftee must be active for at least 90 days. This keeps teams from drafting players, then placing them on the injured list for the majority of the season. For example, if a Rule 5 draftee was only active for 67 days in his first season with his new club, he must be active for an additional 23 days in his second season to satisfy the Rule 5 requirements.\n\nAny player chosen in the Rule 5 draft may be traded to any team while under the Rule 5 restrictions, but the restrictions transfer to the new team. If the new team does not want to keep the player on its 26-man roster for the season, he must be offered back to the team of which he was a member when chosen in the draft.\n\nPlayers are eligible for selection in the Rule 5 draft if they are not on their major league organization's 40-man roster and:\n\n\n\nThese exemption periods (one year longer than those in effect previously) went into effect as part of a new Collective Bargaining Agreement in October 2006. The change took effect immediately, exempting many players from the 2006 Rule 5 draft even though they had been signed in some cases more than four years before the new agreement came into effect. Prior to the rule change, players were exempt from the first two or three Rule 5 drafts held after their signing (regardless of the year they were drafted), rather than from the first three or four Rule 5 drafts after their signing.\n\nThere can be exceptions to these rules, however. Players may also be eligible to be selected due to having a previous contract voided and then resigning with their original signing team within a year. Notable players selected due to this rule include Wei-Chung Wang and Elvis Luciano.\n\nTo prevent excessive turnover in the minor league levels, each draftee costs $100,000. If the draftee does not stay on the selecting team's 26-man (major league) roster all season, the player must be offered back to his original team at half-price ($50,000). Prior to the 2017-2021 CBA, each draftee cost $50,000 and therefore $25,000 to be reacquired by his original team. Organizations may also draft players from AA or lower to play for their AAA affiliates (for $12,000) and may draft players from A teams or lower to play for their AA affiliates (for $4,000).\n\nThe Rule 5 draft has opened opportunities for teams to take other teams' top prospects who may not be ready for the major leagues. A prominent example is Johan Santana, who was chosen in the 1999 Rule 5 draft by the Florida Marlins when the Houston Astros declined to put him on their 40-man roster, and then traded to the Minnesota Twins in a pre-arranged deal. The Twins kept Santana on their roster for the 2000 season, despite the pitcher's subpar performance that season (6.49 ERA). After the 2000 season, the Twins had the right to option Santana to their minor league system, but chose not to during the 2001 season. He was briefly optioned to Class AAA at the start of the 2002 season, then returned to the major leagues at the end of May and established himself as an above-average pitcher; he went on to win Cy Young Awards in 2004 and 2006. Santana had not played above Class A in minor league baseball before being chosen in the Rule 5 draft.\n\n"}

Its lyrics are filled with many historic and cultural references, such as to the \"digger\", Albert Namatjira and Ned Kelly, among others. Its popularity has allowed it to join the ranks of other patriotic songs considered as alternatives to the Australian national anthem, \"Advance Australia Fair\". It is commonly taught in primary schools.\n\nOver the years since the song's release, there have been calls for it to become Australia's national anthem, notably in 2011 by former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett.\n\n\"I Am Australian\" is popular at celebrations such as Australia Day and New Year's Day, as it celebrates the diversity of Australian society.\n\n\"I Am Australian\" is often sung by Australian fans at numerous sporting events. It was sung by The Seekers at the 1994 AFL Grand Final.\n\nIt was often played at citizenship ceremonies from 2008 until 2012 when the Copyright Tribunal ruled that this was an infringement and ordered the Federal Government to pay Bruce Woodley $149,743.34 in compensation.\n\nIt was one of the final numbers performed at the 2016 Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo hosted at Etihad Stadium in Melbourne. It was sung primarily by Australian military personnel with backing vocals and musical accompaniment by the combined acts of the Tattoo.\n\nSpectators seated in the public gallery of the Australian House of Representatives erupted into applause and sang part of \"I am Australian\" when Parliament voted on and legalised same sex marriage on 7 December 2017.\n\nIn 1996 the Salvation Army used the song in TV advertisements for its Red Shield Appeal.\n\nIn October 2003, in conjunction with the sponsorship of the 2003 Rugby World Cup, Australian telecommunications giant Telstra launched a new campaign centered on the song remixed and performed by Rai Thistlethwayte. The campaign was produced by advertising company Young and Rubicam.\n\nIn aid of the Farmhand Foundation's Drought Relief Appeal, Telstra released a CD of the Rai Thistlethwayte remix that sold for $6. A total of $100,000 was raised from the profits \"($4.05 per CD)\" generated from the sale of the CD. The actual published copy of the CD credits \"Performed by: Rai Thistlewayte & other artists\" and \"Music re-arranged by: Rai Thistlewayte\".\n\nIn 2008, Telstra used a different version of the song recorded by the Sydney band, Botanics, for advertising their mobile coverage of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.\n\nIn 2009 two additional verses were added to show remembrance during the official National Day of Mourning for the victims of the Black Saturday bushfires. Woodley performed the song along with his daughter Clare and Kinglake fire survivors Merelyn and David Carter during the memorial service at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne on 22 February.\n\n\"I Am Australian\" was released in 1997 by trio Judith Durham (of The Seekers), Russell Hitchcock (from Air Supply) and Yothu Yindi's Mandawuy Yunupingu. EMI Australia released the single and it reached number 17 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart.\n\n\"I Am Australian\" was covered in 2014 by Dami Im, Jessica Mauboy, Justice Crew, Nathaniel Willemse, Samantha Jade and Taylor Henderson, with John Foreman on piano. Sony Music Australia released their cover as a single on 24 January 2014, as part of Sydney's Australia Day celebrations.\n\nOn recording the song, the artists said: \n\nA live video is available for the Take 40! website of the artists singing the song on a floating stage in the middle of Sydney Harbour.\n"}

{"id": "1889058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889058", "title": "Weston Noble", "text": "Weston Noble\n\nWeston H. Noble (November 30, 1922 – December 21, 2016) was an American music educator and conductor.\n\nThe Ervin and Phyllis Johnson Professor of Music Emeritus at Luther College since 2005, he was best known for his 57-year tenure on the faculty as conductor of the Nordic Choir from 1948 to 2005 and the Luther College Concert Band from 1948 to 1973. He served as guest director for over 800 music festivals in all three media, choral, orchestral and wind, spanning four continents.\n\nFollowing retirement from Luther in 2005, he engaged in a series of guest professorships at sister Lutheran colleges in the Midwest: artist-in-residence at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where he taught in the music department and conducted the Carthage Choir; visiting professor and interim conductor of the Wartburg Choir at Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa; and guest conductor of the Augustana Choir at Augustana College in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\n\nWeston Henry Noble was born and raised on a farm located just west of Riceville, Iowa to parents of English ancestry. Later, he was confirmed in the Free Methodist Church and received his early education in a country one-room schoolhouse until the eighth grade, afterward attending the local Riceville High School. Like many young Iowans with an interest in music at that time, Noble played in the high school band, sang in the choir, and played clarinet solos at state music contest. He first demonstrated his talents when taking piano lessons at the urging of his paternal aunt, Ruby (Noble) Dunton, and came to master the clarinet, organ, and piano as well.\n\nGraduating from high school at the age of 16, his original intention was to enroll at The University of Iowa, then the largest and most prominent institution of higher learning in the state. Through the influence of his father, Merwin Henry Noble, Weston enrolled instead at nearby Luther College in Decorah in 1939. Majoring in history with studies in music (not yet a major at the college), he quickly drew the attention of the music faculty due to his demonstrated talents in conducting, which were sparked, according to Noble, by the last minute request of Schola Cantorum director Theodore Hoelty-Nickel to lead a rehearsal of the choir in his absence. In his second year, he began leading rehearsals for the ensemble. He completed his student teaching at the local Decorah High School.\n\nDue largely to the intense patriotism of World War II and anticipating eventual conscription, Noble volunteered for military service and was called to active duty in February 1943, in the spring semester of his senior year. Nevertheless, arrangements were made for him and others to accelerate their studies and complete their final semester prior to commencement. He graduated magna cum laude. Trained as a tank driver, he saw action in the Battle of the Bulge in 1944 and was part of the main Allied thrust into the heart of Nazi Germany in 1945. Noble \"liberated\" some items from Berlin during the initial stages of the Allied occupation which he mailed home. After arriving home and teaching high school for a year in Iowa, Noble's father sent him a letter notifying him that he had a large package to pick up. The package contained a marble bust of Beethoven possibly previously owned by Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. It was somehow acquired by an acquaintance of Noble who attended the Nuremberg Trials. Today the sculpture is being analyzed to find out who made it and when it was made.\n\nDischarged from military service, Noble returned to Iowa in 1946 and took a position as a high school teacher in Lu Verne, where he directed the school's music program and taught courses in the social sciences. After a two-year stint, he began graduate studies in music at the University of Michigan. In 1948, his alma mater, Luther College, sought him out to fill a one-year faculty appointment as interim director of the band and choir. His appointment was extended to two years, and then became more permanent beginning in 1950. During a highly distinguished 57-year career, Noble served as music director of the Luther College Concert Band from 1948–1973 and the Nordic Choir from 1948-2005.\n\nFollowing his retirement, he served a one-year appointment as visiting conductor-in-residence at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin during the 2007-08 academic year. During 2008-09, Mr. Noble conducted The Wartburg Choir and Ritterchor at a nearby sister institution, Wartburg College, in Waverly, Iowa.\n\nNoble was an internationally acclaimed conductor as well as a music educator. His distinguished career included conducting more than 900 music festivals throughout the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Russia, Asia, and South America. The venues included Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall in New York, the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., the Los Angeles Music Center, Chicago Orchestra Hall, the Ordway Theater in St. Paul, Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis, and the Bolshoi, Kremlin and Tchaikovsky Halls in Moscow. He is the only director to have led all-state choruses, bands and orchestras in all fifty states.\n\nIn 2006, Noble was guest director of a choir partly made up of Nordic Choir alumni. This choir had a two-week concert tour of Europe in which they held a residence at the Salzburg Festival. From that tour was formed the Weston Noble Alumni Choir, a 70-voice choir that meets on the campus of Luther College every summer for a week of rehearsals and a performance. The Alumni Choir returned to Europe in 2010 for a two-week concert tour and in the summer of 2012 completed a one-week tour of California.\n\nIn the spring of 2006, he conducted the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in a national radio broadcast. He also received the Distinguished Service Award from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, making him the only non-Mormon to ever receive this award. In June 2006, he was once again the guest conductor at Guam's 3rd Annual Pacific Summer Music Festival. Most recently he guest conducted the JMU ACDA Choral Fest.\n\nIn December 2010, at the age of 88 years, Noble traveled to South Korea for the first time, conducting a concert of Handel's \"Messiah\" for the Camarata Music Company. Noble died in December 2016 at the age of 94 of complications from a fall.\n\nNoble built the 72-voice Nordic Choir into one of the most elite a cappella college choirs in the United States. His Nordic Choir has performed throughout the United States and, indeed, much of the world. He served as guest conductor at more than 950 music festivals around the world.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1889074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889074", "title": "List of Xanth characters", "text": "List of Xanth characters\n\nThe following is a list of characters in the \"Xanth\" series by Piers Anthony.\n\nThe Magicians of Xanth are a subset of fictional characters from the Xanth series of fantasy genre novels by Piers Anthony (b. 1934). The Magicians are usually humans. They possess powerful magical abilities, and so are the only humans who are able to take the role of \"King of Human Xanth\". Magicians who are female may be called \"Sorceresses,\" but the may not become king. This article describes the Magicians of Xanth, who are listed alphabetically.\n\nAeolus was delivered in 949. He became the eighteenth King of Human Xanth in 971, succeeding Humfrey. His talent was the control the weather. When he died in 1042, he was succeeded by Trent.\n\nArnolde, a rare centaur magician, is introduced in \"Centaur Aisle\". Initially, his talent is described as the ability to generate an aisle of magic around his body when he is in Mundania. When Arnolde is ninety, his magic is discovered and he is banished from Centaur Isle by his fellow centaurs. Arnolde is well regarded by humans, however, because his magical ability enabled the rescue of King Trent and Queen Iris from a Mundanian prison. He is an acting-king during the reign of Trent.\n\nIn \"Night Mare\", when Arnolde is ninety-eight, he is for a short time, a centaur king. During his reign, he declares that Sorceresses are merely female Magicians, and therefore eligible to serve as Kings of Xanth. In \"Golem in the Gears\", Arnolde reveals that when he carries \"reverse wood\", he is able to create an aisle of non-magic in Xanth. The true nature of Arnolde's talent is revealed in \"Currant Events\".\n\nBink is the \"Magician of Magical Invulnerability\" and the main character in the first two novels of the Xanth series, \"A Spell for Chameleon\" and \"The Source of Magic\". He is the son of Roland of the High Council and Bianca. He serves as king pro-tem during Trent's reign.\n\nBink is banished for not possessing a magic talent when, in fact, he does possess magical ability. Bink's magic does not want to be known because, if it were, those of non-magical means would injure Bink and his family, with the magic being indirectly responsible. Hence, in order to keep itself hidden, Bink's magic works in quiet ways, by seeming coincidence, and very few people know of it. For example, it causes an invisible giant to walk by just as Bink was to reveal his magic whilst under a truth spell. Furthermore, Bink's magic protects him, making him seem an unusually lucky man.\n\nDawn's magical ability allows her to know anything about the animate. She is the daughter of Dolph and Electra. She and her twin, Eve, appear in \"Faun & Games\". In \"Well-Tempered Clavicle\", she marries Pick a Bone. Her children with him are a human boy named Piton and a skeleton girl named Data.\n\nDolph is the \"Magician of Metamorphosis\". He has the power to transform and shapeshift into anything. His parents are Dor and Irene. Dolph was engaged to Nada Naga but chose to marry Electra. His twin sorceress daughters are Dawn and Eve. He is a protagonist in \"Heaven Cent\" and \"Isle of View\".\n\nMagician Dor is the son of Bink and Chameleon. He served as king pro-tem during Trent's reign. Dor is able to make inanimate objects, such as rocks, clouds, water, and bones, speak. He is married to Irene. The stork delivered them two children, Princess Ivy and Prince Dolph and they have a third child with magical ability, Princess Ida. Dor appears in \"Castle Roogna\", \"Centaur Aisle\", \"Ogre, Ogre\", and \"Night Mare\".\n\nThrough her magic, Eve knows all about the inanimate. She is the daughter of Dolph and Electra. She and her twin sister, Dawn, appear in \"Faun & Games\" and in \"Jumper Cable\", where they fight over a boy.\n\nGrey is the \"Magician of Magic Nullification\". This means he can nullify magic near him and then restore it stronger than it was before. He is the son of Magician Murphy and Neo-Sorceress Vadne. He married Sorceress Ivy, who rescued him from Mundania in \"Man from Mundania\". He is the father of the triplet Sorceresses, Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm. On Ptero, a moon of Ida, when Grey is older, he is known as the royal consort because his wife, Ivy, is a future King of Xanth. Captain of Xanth's star-ship, the Beta, during a dream voyage to rescue centaur expedition Alpha in Board Stiff from Demoness Xornax.\n\nGrundy was a sarcastic doll-sized golem made out of string and clay. He was given the ability to speak to any living creature. He understands all languages from human to plants. He was created by magician Humfrey. Eventually he is turned into a real man by X(A/N) but remains his same height. \n\nIda is the \"Sorceress of the Idea\": within limits, any idea presented to her may come to be. Ida must first believe that the idea will eventuate and the idea must come to her from someone who is unaware of her magical ability. Ida is the twin sister of Princess Ivy, although this may have been the result of her own talent. In \"Knot Gneiss\", Ida weds Prince Hilarion. A small moon called Ptero orbits over her, holding every person in Xanth there ever was or might be. The Ida on Ptero has another moon (Pyramid) where the inhabitants use a barter system that results in givers gaining size and receivers losing size. This Ida has Torus, whose Ida has Cone, whose Ida has Dumbbell, and so on. This continues into infinity, with each moon having different shapes, inhabitants, and rules. Thus, Ida is the caretaker of every conceivable and inconceivable idea. The chain of moons extends to Mundania and cycles back to Ida herself. In the later books of the Xanth series, a visit to Ida is highly desired.\n\nIlene is the \"Sorceress of Making Illusions Real\". For instance, she is able to make an illusion of maturity an actuality. Ilene is the daughter of Iris and Trent (after their rejuvenation).\n\nThe beautiful, green haired Irene is the \"Sorceress of Plants\". She was able to create a massive arboreal defence about Castle Roogna. When she was King of Xanth, Arnold Centaur decreed her magical ability 'Magician level'. Irene is the daughter of Trent and Iris. Her husband is Dor and her children, raised under her stern eye, are Ivy, Ida, and Dolph. Irene succeeded her mother, Iris, as a female King of Xanth. Irene was a protagonist in \"Centaur Aisle\" and \"Dragon on a Pedestal\". She served as king pro-tem during the reign of Trent.\n\nIris is the \"Sorceress of Illusion\". She can create illusions in all of the five senses, including illusions of silence and invisibility, and hold them in place with minimal effort. Her illusion can exist a short way into the non-magical realm. Iris possesses a devious and keen intellect. She is a Queen of Xanth by her marriage to Trent. She is also the first contemporary female King of Xanth. Iris is the mother of Irene. She is a protagonist in \"A Spell for Chameleon\" and \"Night Mare\". Later in the series, she makes a rejuvenated appearance in \"Geis of the Gargoyle\".\n\nIvy is the \"Sorceress of enhancement\". She can enhance people and objects; for example, by improving their endurance and aim. Ivy is capable of enhancing any quality she desires, or even to make things as she unconsciously perceives them; for example, when she first met Humprey's son Hugo, who was described as mentally slow and had the talent to conjure rotten fruit, she enhanced his qualities while he was in her presence, making him more intelligent and giving him the ability to conjure ripe fruit, all because she perceived him as intelligent. Ivy is the daughter of Dor and Irene. She has blonde hair with a tinge of green (from her mother).Ivy's twin sister is Ida. Ivy is married to Magician Grey. Their children are the triplets, Sorceresses Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm. Ivy is a protagonist in \"Dragon on a Pedestal\", \"\", and \"Man from Mundania\".\n\nKadence is the \"Sorceress of Alignment\" who can make anything move in step, to a common beat. Her mother is Princess Rhythm and her father is Cyrus, the first cyborg in Xanth.\n\nThe \"Triplet Sorceresses\" are the children of Ivy and Grey. Melody has blonde hair with a tinge of green and blue eyes like her mother, Harmony has brown eyes and hair like her father, and Rhythm has red hair and green eyes like her cousin, Dawn. Their magical ability allows them to create or enable anything they envision while playing music. If two of the three play together, the power is squared and if all three play, it is cubed. Melody hums, Harmony plays the harmonica and Rhythm beats her drum.\n\nMurphy is the \"Magician who Makes Things Go Wrong.\" He unsuccessfully challenged for the monarchy and was exiled for a time, and returned to Xanth with a promise of allegiance. Murphy has a son, Grey, with Sorceress Vadne. Murphy first appeared in \"Castle Roogna\". He has served as king \"pro tem\" during Dor's reign.\n\nPaxti is a magician who creates enchanted paths that can prevent the passage of any creature. He appears in \"Cube Route\".\n\nRagna Roc is a powerful magician bird. He is able to make an illusion real or make reality an illusion, but he cannot repeat such a transformation: that is, he cannot reverse the \"real-ness\" of something he has already reversed.\n\nRempel is a centaur magician whose talent is to know the talents of others. He is introduced in \"Xone of Contention\".\n\nSea Hag is the \"Sorceress of Immortality\" and a member of the first human colony of Xanth. On her death, Sea Hag inhabits and possesses another male or female body. The character is introduced in \"Golem in the Gears\" and given further explanation in \"Question Quest\" and \"The Dastard\".\n\nSherlock is the \"Magician of Reversal\" who can reverse the nature or characteristics of any person or object. His wife is Clio and his adopted child is Ciriana. Sherlock is introduced in \"Demons Don't Dream\", in the company of his friend Dug Mundane, and returns in \"Currant Events\", where he discovers his magical ability.\n\nSurprise was the \"Sorceress of Talents\" who can use any magical ability, but only once. However, by using her imagination, she is able to endlessly reproduce any effect. Her parents were Grundy Golem and Rapunzel. Surprise was just that to her parents, as the stork delivered her when she was five. She was a central figure in \"Geis of the Gargoyle\" and \"Stork Naked\". She has a daughter by Umlaut. In \"The Dastard\", it is discovered that she can reuse talents she's used before, after a long time has passed but the Dastard \"unhappens\" this discovery.\n\nTallyho is the \"Magician of Talents\", who creates and assigns magical abilities to newly conceived babies. He lives in the Gourd. His predecessor was the Magician of Talents who assigned the talent of cursing to all the descendants of the original Curse Fiends. The character is introduced in \"Up In A Heaval\".\n\nTapis was the \"Sorceress of Tapestry\". She created enchanted tapestries, including one decorating Castle Roogna. Tapis was the wife of Merlin and the mother of Jonathan and Taplin, and took in Electra.\n\nVadne is the \"Sorceress of Topology\": she can change the shape of an object without altering its size, mass, or intrinsic properties. She married Murphy and they had a son is Grey. Dor decreed her ability to be Magician-level.\n\nThe Kings of Xanth are humans who possess a magical talent that is strong enough for them to be classified as a Magician, a pre-requisite for the role. This list is composed of the Kings of Xanth in order of their reign. This does not include the magicians that served as king pro-tem (Bink, Dor, Irene) during the reign of King Trent unless they had previously served formally. \n\nMerlin, the first King of Xanth and Magician of knowledge, reigned from 204. He married Tapis; their children are Jonathan and Taplin.\n\nRoogna, the second King of Xanth, reigned from 228 until 286. Roogna is able to \"adapt\" the magic of living things, changing it into a similar but distinct form of magic. He built the castle which was named for him and which became the home of the monarchy of Xanth in \"A Spell for Chameleon\". Roogna is married to Taplin, Merlin's daughter.\n\nRana, the \"Magician of Creation\", was the third king and the first female King of Xanth. She ruled from 286 to 325. She is the mother of Rune.\n\nReitas, the \"Magician of Problem Solving\", was the fourth King of Xanth, reigning from 325 to 350. Despite his title, he created problems.\n\nRune, the \"Magician of Evocation\", was the fifth King of Xanth . He ruled from 350 to 378. Rune's mother was Rana.\n\nJonathan, the sixth King of Xanth, the \"Magician of Zombies\" or \"Zombie master\", reigned from 378 to 478. He is able to re-animate the dead of Xanth. He himself was once a zombie. Jonathan is the son of King Merlin and Sorceress Tapis. He is married to Millie the Ghost; they have twin children, Hiatus and Lacuna.

His reign began in 623. While married to a curse fiend, he had a daughter, Threnody by a Demoness.\n\nYin-Yang, eleventh King of Xanth, is able to create invokable spells. Yin is his good self, who creates spells of good alignment, and Yang his evil self, who creates spells of evil. His first wife was Threnody. After her death, Yin-Yang remarried and had a son, Lord Bliss.\n\nFid, whose talent was alchemy, was the twelfth King of Xanth. According to \"Question Quest\", he is, at most, only half human.\n\nQuan, the \"Magician of Herbalism\", was the thirteenth King of Xanth. His uncle was Muerte A. Fid.\n\nElona, the \"Magician of Longevity\", was the fourteenth King and second female King of Xanth. Her reign began in 797.\n\nWarren, the fifteenth King of Xanth, was a ghost who could create ghosts. He was exorcised by the people of Xanth after forty-three years in power.\n\nEbnez became the sixteenth King of Xanth in 909. He is able to adapt magical inanimate items. Ebnez married Mnem and their daughters are the Muses. He adapted a stone to make an impenetrable magical field about Xanth, which was removed by order of King Trent.\n\nHumfrey, the seventeenth King of Xanth, is the \"Magician of Information\", also known as \"Good Magician Humfrey\". He is an elderly, withered, gnome-like man with five and a half wives. Humfrey is very curious and has a good memory. He is said to possess all knowledge, but his magical talent is actually the ability to find the answers to all questions. In \"Heaven Cent\" it is implied that Humfrey's magical talent may be no more than that of locating other magic that may be of use to him. His story of becoming a master of information is recounted in \"Question Quest\". Humfrey believes his magical abilities are not those of a Magician, and so he studies for a degree in magic at Demon University in order to validate his title of \"Magician\".\n\nHumfrey was a king pro-tem during Trent's reign. He lives in the Good Magician's Castle, the former Castle Zombie. It is an enchanted place that provides easy access for Humfrey, but any visitor must face three challenges posed by him. Visitors must prove their worthiness to approach Humphrey with their queries.\n\nHumfrey is the protagonist of \"Question Quest\" and is instrumental in every book of the series. He acknowledges characters in non-Xanth books by Piers Anthony, such as \"On a Pale Horse\". \n\nAeolus, the eighteenth King of Xanth, is known as the \"Magician of Storms\". His predecessor was Good Magician Humfrey who discovered his abilities when he was six. Aeolus became King of Xanth at twenty-two and ruled until his death at ninety-three in \"A Spell for Chameleon\". Four years into his reign, Aeolus made an edict that anyone born without a magic talent would be exiled from Xanth. In his later years, Aeolus fell into senility, a fact he never acknowledged.\n\nIn \"Question Quest\", Good Magician Humphrey has flashbacks that give details as to how Humphrey found Aeolus, how Aeolus became king and how he made his edict.\n\nLater in the series, in \"Xone of Contention\", Magician Grey and Robota, a golem, travel back in time to the events of \"A Spell for Chameleon\". They meet Aeolus and learn he is not the fool he appears: Aeolus keeps his soul in a \"soular cell\" that was created centuries before by Magician Yin/Yang. The cell prevents the aging and death of the person whose soul is held within. However, the cell cannot undo aging that occurred before the person's soul was stored. Aeolus' magic resides with his soul, which he removes from the cell only when he needs to use it. Aeolus claims he does not need his soul day to day, and that he feigns senility in order to avoid mundane tasks, but Grey realises that Aeolus' unconscionable behaviour is the result of his lack of soul. Aeolus' efforts to stave off death fail, and he succumbs shortly after Grey and Robota depart. He is succeeded by Magician Trent.\n\nMagician Trent has been a major character in the Xanth series since the very beginning. He is the nineteenth king of Xanth and is married to Sorceress Iris.\n\nTrent's power allows him to transform any living thing into any other living thing. Whatever form he renders becomes one's \"natural\" form. Any offspring sired or birthed while in a form will be in that form.\n\nIn his childhood, Trent was trained by Good Magician Humphrey. After trying to take the throne, he was exiled to Mundania for 20 years, then returned to Xanth and was crowned King after the passing of the Storm King. He later retired and moved to the North Village with Sorceress Iris.\n\nThe \"Magician of Transformation\", King Trent used to be referred to as the Evil Magician for attempting to take over the throne prior to \"A Spell for Chameleon\". For this offense he was exiled to Mundania. There he married, and he and his wife had a son, but he lost them both to illness. Later he was accidentally helped back into Xanth by Magician Bink and Chameleon. After the Storm King died, Trent was made king on the condition that he marry Sorceress Iris. He did so, but only out of convenience; it took him over twenty years to recover from the loss of his first wife and son. Eventually, though, Trent came to love Iris. He stepped down as king in the 6th Xanth novel, \"Night Mare\", after which Bink's son Magician Dor became the new King of Xanth, with Trent's daughter Sorceress Irene as his wife. \n\nTrent now lives in quiet retirement in North Village. He was instrumental in all of the first six Xanth books, but was featured as a main character in \"A Spell for Chameleon\" and \"Centaur Aisle\". Later in the series, he makes a rejuvenated appearance in \"Harpy Thyme\". He remains one of the few people to recognize Bink's extraordinary talent.\n\nA highly intelligent demon of Xanth who is writing a doctoral thesis on the supremacy of demons over other lifeforms entitled \"Fallibilities of Other Intelligent Life in Xanth\". He repaid a debt to the Good Magician Humfrey, incurred by seeking information from him on other lifeforms, by serving time in a small vial answering questions for people. After repaying the debt, he stayed in the vial to gain further information.\nBeauregard met Good Magician Humphrey in demon school, where they became friends and greeted each other with insults. In the book \"Air Apparent\", it is revealed that he works as a tour guide in hell, and has fallen in love with Angela Angel, when their toes accidentally brushed a love spring while they were arguing with each other. Angela later returns in \"Knot Gneiss\" trying to find substance so she and Beauregard can be together in Xanth.\n\nA form of coral kept in stasis in preservative fluids in the land of Xanth. Its goal was to prevent the awakening of the Demon X(A/N), but it failed. Many people are held, or have been held, in its preservative fluids for eventual release including (Neo-)Sorceress Vadne, Magician Murphy, and Harold Harpy. The Brain Coral was a main character in the book \"The Source of Magic\".\n\nThe wife of the Demon X(A/N) and mother of Nimbus. She lives in the Nameless Castle. Her talent is to form poison from water (more like the chlorine used to clean things with). Before she met Demon X(A/N), she was plain, mean, and stupid. She wished to be smart, nice, and beautiful, and Nimby (Demon X(A/N) in disguise) changed her. She had only one tear left in her eyes, half a tear in each, and if she was to cry that last tear, she would become blind. In the end she shed the tear when Nimby was set on fire by her horrible parents. Nimby and Chlorine have a son named Nimbus. She has a twin sister named Fluorine, who unfortunately is just as mean and nasty as Chlorine used to be.\n\nThe Demon whose extended presence created Xanth's magic. He is constantly at battle with Earth, Jupiter, Neptune, and other Demons who represent the planets in an astral game of gaining recognition. Earth is currently the most recognized one with Xanth coming dead last because nobody seems to believe in it. X(A/N) first appears in the second book, \"The Source of Magic\", and is the star of the 20th Xanth book, \"Yon Ill Wind\" (as Nimby, a horrendously ugly donkey-headed dragon), and the 23rd, \"Xone of Contention\". He currently enjoys living in the floating castle with his consort Chlorine and son Nimbus. He has also been known to travel in the form of Nimby.\n\nAlso called Cumulo-Fracto-Nimbus, this demon cloud roams the land of Xanth, blowing up storms to cause mischief. Later, he tamed Happy Bottom in the Region of Air and had a daughter, Fray Cloud (Fracto and Happy Bottom). He was introduced in \"Centaur Aisle\" and appeared in many subsequent books.\n\nThe Gap Dragon or Stanley Steamer is a dragon that lives in the Gap Chasm that runs the width of Xanth. Because the Gap Chasm had a forget spell put on it by Dor in \"Castle Roogna\", nobody could remember it and therefore couldn't remember the dragon, making anyone who entered the Chasm easy prey. In \"Dragon on a Pedestal\", he was de-aged at the fountain of youth, after which he was befriended by three-year-old Princess Ivy. Ivy renamed him Stanley Steamer because the Gap Dragon can only breathe steam, not fire. After an accident with Jordan The Barbarian, Stanley was sent far away. He was later found by Jordan The Barbarian, Threnody, Grundy The Golem, Rapunzel, and Snortimer at a Faun and Nymph lake retreat. The Gap Dragon still today protects the Gap Chasm from intruders, catching prey, and always being a faithful friend to Princess Ivy. He is married to Stella/Stacey Steamer (Princess Ivy named her Stacey but the Xanth lexicon put it down as Stella). They alternate guarding the Gap Chasm and watching their son Steven.\n\nFormerly called Tropical Storm Gladys, Happy Bottom was blown into Xanth from Mundania when the Demon X(A/N)th entered the land of Xanth, stirring out magic dust and causing madness. She was tamed by Fracto later. Their daughter is Fray Cloud.\n\nJenny is named after a fan of the Xanth series who corresponded with Piers Anthony after a severe car accident that left her partially paralyzed. Jenny, who is based on the elves of the ElfQuest series by Wendy and Richard Pini, comes from the world of Two Moons. Her constant companion is her cat Sammy, who can find anything but home. Her friends are Che Centaur and Gwendolyn Goblin. They are introduced in \"Isle of View\". Jenny marries the werewolf Prince Jeremy in \"Zombie Lover\". Sammy Cat, who is named for the Mundanian Jenny's pet cat, has his own adventure as a main character in \"Up in a Heaval\", meeting his own true love Claire Voyant Cat in the process.\n\nA man transformed into a tree by Trent for 76 years in the Xanth universe. He rejected offers to be transformed back into a man and seems to like being a tree during that time. His talent is Voice Projection, letting him speak from anywhere without the use of his vocal cords, and he retained this ability even as a tree. \n\nBy the time of the novel \"Zombie Lover\", he eventually felt a desire to have an adventure of his own. With his spirit temporarily anchored to Breanna of the Black Wave, he traveled around Xanth with her, and the pair ultimately fell in love. In the process, he and Breanna developed a newfound appreciation for the zombies of Xanth, and he agreed to become the new Zombie Master in place of Jonathan, who was seeking to retire. \n\nJustin was subsequently returned to human form and took youth elixir to restore him to the age of 18, spending the next three years with Breanna and marrying her when he was 21 again (following the events of \"Swell Foop\", during which time he bore the Ring of Idea), then assuming the duties of the Zombie Master full-time. He and Breanna subsequently became the parents of a child named Amber Dawn, who had been delivered by the time of \"Cube Route\".\n\nAn ogress born with the talent of a supersonic voice. Having her ogre characteristics diluted by having accidentally gotten a magic talent she isn't as ugly and stupid as a normal ogre. Because of this she wanted to be a main character since nothing bad happens to a main character. She traveled with Mela Merwoman and Ida in \"The Color of Her Panties\" in order to ask the Good Magician Humphrey. She marries Smithereen Ogre and has two children with him: Og and Not-Og\n\nSon and heir to Simurgh. He is being tutored by Che Centaur. He has dated Ilene, the second daughter of Trent and Iris. Appears in \"Roc and a Hard Place\" and stars in \"The Dastard\", \"Swell Foop\" and \"Air Apparent\".\n\nThe wisest of birds and keeper of the seeds of the tree of life. Based on the Simurgh of Persian myth. She is introduced in \"Dragon on a Pedestal\" as a leader of the winged animals of Xanth. It is said that she has already survived the destruction and recreation of the universe several times. She married Chex Centaur to Chieron Centaur, and commanded all winged monsters to protect their son Che. Her chick is Sim.\n\nSnortimer is the monster under Ivy's bed in the land of Xanth. He loves to grab at pretty young ankles. He will fade out of existence when Ivy gets too old to believe in bed monsters. He stayed with the fauns and nymphs in place of Stanley Steamer (the Gap Dragon).\n\nThe mate of Wilda Wiggle, Volney was a main character in \"Vale of the Vole\". Volney replaces his S's with V's in speech; however, to his ears, S's from others sound like hissing.\n\nDaughter of Fracto and Happy Bottom.\n\n"}

The game was endorsed by professional off-road racer Ivan Stewart. Virgin Games produced several home versions in 1990. In 1991, a home console version for the Nintendo Entertainment System was later released by Leland's Tradewest subsidiary, followed by versions for most major home formats including the Master System, Genesis, Super NES, Amiga, and DOS. A port for the Atari Jaguar was announced but never released. Some of the ports removed Ivan Stewart's name from the title due to licensing issues and are known simply as Super Off Road.\n\nIn the game, up to three players (four in the NES version through use of either the NES Satellite or NES Four Score) compete against each other or the computer in racing around several top-view indoor off-road truck tracks of increasing difficulty. There are eight different tracks (twelve in the SMS version and sixteen in the SNES version) and 99 races altogether on most versions (the SNES version loops through 64 races without ending). All races are raced more than once. First place results earn the player points to continue in the championship and money with which to upgrade their truck or buy more nitro. The goal is to reach the end of the season with the most money earned. Continues are available but whereas players can get extra money in the arcade version, in the home versions, the player's money is reset to zero. This is one of the first games where the player could upgrade his or her vehicle by earning points or money (although in Atari Games' \"Sprint\" series, one could upgrade their racer using wrenches), a system that is used in many racing games today. The Spectrum version of the game was voted number 47 in the \"Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time\". The game was ranked the 35th best game of all time by \"Amiga Power\". \"MegaTech\" gave the game a score of 83%\n\nIn the original arcade game, the red, blue, and yellow CPU trucks were 'driven' by \"Madman\" Sam Powell, \"Hurricane\" Earl Stratton, and \"Jammin'\" John Morgan, respectively. The names were taken from the development staff: Sam composed the music, and Earl and John were two of the software programmers. The \"Track Pack\" added \"Steamin'\" Steve High and \"Hot Rod\" John Rowe, representing graphics and project direction, respectively. By using these names, this meant that further licensing deals were not required.\n\nThe Super NES version was notable for prominently featuring the Toyota brand; the name and logo were displayed on various tracks, and pre-race music was inspired by the \"I love what you do for me Toyota\" jingle that was used by the company's marketing campaign at the time of the game's release. This version also lacked any licensing or reference to Ivan Stewart, replacing him instead with the late Mickey Thompson in the gray truck (primarily without approval from Danny Thompson). The NES version does have the Toyota label on its cartridge art, but otherwise the ad is not present.\n\nThe game was not originally developed or published by Williams, Midway, or Atari Games, but by the Leland Corporation (which was acquired by WMS Industries, the holding company of said developers, in 1994). Both the arcade version of the game and its \"Track Pack\" upgrade can be found in \"Midway Arcade Treasures 3\" for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. However, it does not have the \"Ironman\" Ivan Stewart license, and as such is known simply as \"Super Off Road\", with the white, computer-controlled car being \"driven\" by \"'Lightning' Kevin Lydy\" (in the original arcade cabinet, the white car is \"driven\" by Ivan Stewart), a real-life graphic designer on the original arcade game, continuing the previous tradition regarding the CPU drivers being named for its programmers.\n\n\"Super Off Road\" was also included in the 2012 compilation \"Midway Arcade Origins\" for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\nThe \"Track Pack\", released in 1989, was an add-on board for arcade units that contains eight brand new tracks: Shortcut, Cutoff Pass, Pig Bog, Rio Trio, Leapin' Lizards, Redoubt About, Boulder Hill, and Volcano Valley. It also gave the brand new ability for players to choose between either the regular truck or the dune buggy; both vehicles had different characteristics accordingly and added a new element to the game.\n\nSinclair User rated the arcade version an 8 out of 10 and recommended the game to anyone who enjoyed playing the \"Sprint\" games, calling \"Super Off Road\" \"Super Sprint with dirt\".\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the Lynx version a 3.75 out of 10, commenting that though \"Super Off Road\" was an excellent arcade game, the choppy animation and scrolling in the Lynx version make it almost unplayable.\n\n\"Super Off Road\" gained a number of sequels, the first was titled \"\". It was released for the SNES in 1993 and is based on the Baja 1000 race. The format was changed to a third-person camera instead of an overhead camera. In 1997, an arcade sequel, \"Off Road Challenge\", was released, which again adopted the third-person 3D driving view, and was ported to the Nintendo 64 in 1998.

{"id": "1889137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889137", "title": "Hampton Roads Conference", "text": "Hampton Roads Conference\n\nThe Hampton Roads Conference was a peace conference held between the United States and the Confederate States on February 3, 1865, aboard the steamboat \"River Queen\" in Hampton Roads, Virginia, to discuss terms to end the American Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State William H. Seward, representing the Union, met with three commissioners from the Confederacy: Vice President Alexander H. Stephens, Senator Robert M. T. Hunter, and Assistant Secretary of War John A. Campbell.\n\nThe representatives discussed a possible alliance against France, the possible terms of surrender, the question of whether slavery might persist after the war, and the question of whether the South would be compensated for property lost through emancipation. Lincoln and Seward reportedly offered some possibilities for compromise on the issue of slavery. The only concrete agreement reached was over prisoner-of-war exchanges.\n\nThe Confederate commissioners immediately returned to Richmond at the conclusion of the conference. Confederate President Jefferson Davis announced that the North would not compromise. Lincoln drafted an amnesty agreement based on terms discussed at the Conference, but met with opposition from his Cabinet. John Campbell continued to advocate for a peace agreement and met again with Lincoln after the fall of Richmond on April 2.\n\nIn 1864, pressure mounted for both sides to seek a peace settlement to end the long and devastating Civil War. Several people had sought to broker a North–South peace treaty in 1864. Francis Preston Blair, a personal friend of both Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis, had unsuccessfully encouraged Lincoln to make a diplomatic visit to Richmond. Blair had advocated to Lincoln that the war could be brought to a close by having the two opposing sections of the nation stand down in their conflict, and reunite on grounds of the Monroe Doctrine in attacking the French-installed Emperor Maximilian in Mexico. Lincoln asked Blair to wait until Savannah had been captured.\n\nDavis was pressed for options as the Confederacy faced collapse and defeat. Peace movements in the South had been active since the beginning of the war, and intensified in 1864.\n\nAlexander H. Stephens, Vice President of the Confederate States, had by 1863 become an active advocate for ending the war. Stephens had almost begun negotiations with Lincoln in July 1863, but his efforts were thwarted after Confederate defeat in the Battle of Gettysburg. By 1864, Stephens was an outright dissident against the power of Davis's CSA government, and was invited by General William T. Sherman to discuss independent peace negotiations between the State of Georgia and the federal Union.\n\nStephens addressed the Confederate States Senate as its nominal presiding officer in Richmond on January 6, 1865, urging peace talks with the North. Some Confederate legislators agreed with Stephens and began to agitate for negotiations.\n\nJohn Campbell, another of the peace commissioners, had also opposed secession. Campbell served earlier on the Supreme Court of the United States from 1853 to 1861, but began to consider resignation after Lincoln's first inaugural address in March 1861. He stayed on for the spring term of 1861 and supported the Corwin Amendment to protect slavery from federal intervention.\n\nHoping to prevent a war, Samuel Nelson enlisted Campbell to help broker negotiations over the status of Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor in South Carolina. On March 15, Campbell relayed to Martin Jenkins Crawford a supposed promise from Secretary of State Seward that the federal government would evacuate Fort Sumter within five days. As the Fort remained occupied on March 21, Confederate commissioners pushed Campbell to find out more; Seward reassured Campbell that evacuation would take place and Campbell reassured Crawford: on March 21, March 22, April 1, and hesitantly on April 7. Lincoln had already ordered the fort resupplied. By April 12th, diplomacy had evidently failed and the Bombardment of Fort Sumter began. Campbell resigned his position on the Supreme Court and went South. Fearing he would be persecuted as a Union sympathizer in his home state of Alabama, he moved instead to New Orleans.\n\nCampbell declined a number of positions in the CSA government, but accepted the post of Assistant Secretary of War in President Davis' cabinet in 1862. For the duration of the job, Campbell was criticized for trying to limit the scope of wartime conscription. By late 1864, he was pushing again for an end to the war. In an 1865 letter to Judge Benjamin R. Curtis, he described the disastrous state of the Confederacy and marveled: \"You would suppose there could be no difficulty in convincing men under such circumstances that peace was required. But when I look back upon the events of the winter, I find that I was incessantly employed in making these facts known and to no result.\"\n\nLincoln would clearly insist on full sovereignty of the Union. Slavery posed a more difficult problem. The Republican platform in 1864 had explicitly endorsed abolition; but pushing too hard on the slavery issue might offend mainstream politicians and voters. Within this precarious political situation, in July 1864 Lincoln issued a statement via Horace Greeley:\n\nLincoln confided to James W. Singleton that his primary concern was the Union. In Singleton's words: \"that he never has and never will present any other ultimatum—that he is misunderstood on the subject of slavery—that it shall not stand in the way of peace\". Lincoln's reassurance earned him Singleton's support in the 1864 election.\n\nSeward openly suggested in September 1864 that if the Confederate States relented on the question of independence, the question of slavery would fall \"to the arbitrament of courts of law, and to the councils of legislation\". (He did not mention the ongoing debate over what became the Thirteenth Amendment, and declined to clarify his position in written correspondence.) Seward invited the South to return to the \"common ark of our national security and happiness\" as \"brethren who have come back from their wanderings\".\n\nHaving won the election, Lincoln told Congress that reaching a peace agreement with Davis would be unlikely: \"He affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves. He cannot voluntarily reaccept the Union; we cannot voluntarily yield it.\" However, said Lincoln, the South could end the War by laying down arms:\n\nThey can, at any moment, have peace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the national authority under the Constitution. . . . If questions should remain, we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legislation, conference, courts, and votes, operating only in constitutional and lawful channels. . . . In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority on the part of the insurgents, as the only indispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the government, I retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery. I repeat the declaration made a year ago, that \"while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the Acts of Congress.\n\nBlair duly renewed his efforts in January 1865, and traveled to Richmond on January 11. He met with Davis and outlined a plan to end the war, based partly on a North–South alliance against the French presence in Mexico. Blair assured Davis that Lincoln had become more willing to negotiate.\n\nOn January 12, Davis wrote a letter inviting Lincoln to begin negotiations \"with a view to secure peace to the two countries\". Lincoln replied, via Blair, that he would discuss only \"securing peace to the people of one common country.\" Davis was upset by this response; Blair blamed the political climate in Washington.\n\nAt Blair's suggestion, Davis proposed a meeting between Generals Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant. Lincoln refused. Grant ultimately smoothed over the \"two countries\" dispute and convinced Lincoln to meet the Confederates at Fort Monroe. Davis appointed his three commissioners on January 28 and instructed them to explore all options short of renouncing independence. (Davis's precise understanding of what an \"independent\" Confederacy might be, in 1865, is not fully clear.)\n\nOf the three commissioners, Alexander Stephens and Robert Hunter wanted to focus more on the possibility of an alliance against France; Campbell focused more on a scenario for domestic peace. Campbell wrote in his letter to Curtis:\n\nHe duped Mr. Davis with the belief that President Lincoln regarded the condition of Mexico with more concern than the war; that he would be willing to make a suspension of hostilities under some sort of collusive contract, and to unite Southern and Northern troops on the Rio Grande for the invasion of Mexico, and that after matters were assured in Mexico affairs might be adjusted here. This was the business at Hampton Roads. I was incredulous, Mr. Hunter did not have faith. Mr. Stephens supposed Blair to be \"the mentor of the Administration and Republican party.\n\nThe Union Congress was shaken by the news of possible Confederate peace negotiations in late January, just days before a rescheduled Thirteenth Amendment vote. Some Congress members feared that adopting an emancipation amendment would signal hostility and undermine the talks. \n\nReassurance from Lincoln's secretary John Hay was not convincing to Ohio Democrat Sunset Cox who demanded that Ashley investigate the rumor of impending negotiations. Lincoln issued a memo denying the arrival of Confederates—in Washington.\n\nCox investigated further, decided that Lincoln was \"mistaken or ignorant\", and shocked a crowd of onlookers by voting 'nay' to the Amendment. When the Amendment passed anyway, two members of the \"Seward lobby\"—George O. Jones and William Bilbo—both telegraphed congratulations to Seward and commented on his upcoming meeting with the Confederate diplomats. Historians LaWanda Cox and John Cox (no relation to Sunset Cox) wrote: \"It is worthy of note that these messages of Jones and Bilbo implied a verbal commitment from the Secretary of State that passage of the Amendment would be coupled with a policy of peace and reconciliation which Southerners might accept with relief and Northern Democrats with enthusiasm.\"\nOn January 29, a Confederate Officer with a flag of truce interrupted the Siege of Petersburg to announce the passage of the three Confederate peace commissioners. Soldiers from both armies cheered. On February 1, Seward dropped off a copy of the new amendment in Annapolis, then departed with the \"River Queen\" for Fort Monroe.\n\nLincoln and Stephens had been political allies before the war and the meeting began on friendly terms. Stephens discussed the topic of a military alliance against France in Mexico, but Lincoln cut him off and asked directly about the question of sovereignty. Prodded by Campbell, Lincoln insisted that the South would have to disband its armies and submit to federal authority. Campbell wrote: \"We learned in five minutes that the assurances to Mr. Davis were a delusion, and that union was the condition of peace.\"\n\nOn the question of slavery, Lincoln reportedly told the Confederates that Northern opinion was divided on the question of how new laws would be enforced. Regarding the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln reportedly interpreted it as a war measure that would permanently affect only the 200,000 people who came under Army protection during the War—but noted that the Courts might feel differently.\n\nSeward reportedly showed the Confederates a copy of the newly adopted Thirteenth Amendment, referred to this document also as a war measure, and suggested that if they were to rejoin the Union they might be able to prevent its ratification. After further discussion, Lincoln suggested that the Southern states might \"avoid, as far as possible, the evils of immediate emancipation\" by ratifying the Amendment \"\"prospectively\", so as to take effect—say in five years.\" Seward and Lincoln denied that they were demanding \"unconditional surrender\"; Seward said that rejoining the Union, under the Constitution, could not \"properly be considered as unconditional submission to conquerors, or as having anything humiliating in it.\"\n\nLincoln also offered possible compensation for emancipation, perhaps naming the figure of $400,000,000 which he later proposed to Congress. Reportedly, Seward disagreed with Lincoln; Lincoln responded that the North had been complicit in the slave trade.\n\nThe Conference ended with agreement on prisoner-of-war exchange. Lincoln would release Stephens' nephew in exchange for a Northern official in Richmond—and would recommend that Grant establish a system for prisoner exchange.\n\nThere are no official records of the conference itself, so all reports originate from the subsequent commentary of involved parties. The two lengthy accounts of the Conference—written by Confederates Stephens and Campbell—concur on most of the details. These accounts, along with secondary records from the archives of Lincoln and Seward, suggest that Lincoln and Seward would have compromised on the issue of slavery.\n\nLincoln's personal communications, even from around the time of his \"To Whom it May Concern\" letter, indicate that he might have been willing to privately give ground on slavery. That Lincoln proposed a delayed ratification plan is mentioned by the \"Augusta Chronicle and Sentinel\" in June 1865—based on a report by Stephens from after the meeting. From a legal standpoint, Lincoln never believed that the federal government had the authority to ban slavery in the states—thus his constant emphasis on the status of the Emancipation Proclamation as a measure effective only during wartime. According to Paul Escott, Lincoln's moral opposition to slavery did not override his understanding of the Constitution; therefore, Lincoln may have believed that the rebel states would have a right to reject the Thirteenth Amendment if they rejoined the Union.\n\nSeward's biographers generally agree that the Secretary of State may have suggested an outright rejection of the Amendment. The Confederate delegates spread word of this suggestion privately, contradicting Jefferson Davis's public statements that the surrender terms had been unconscionable.\n\nSome historians dispute Stephens's interpretation of the Conference. Michael Vorenberg writes that Lincoln would have known that a constitutional amendment cannot be \"prospectively\" ratified, and therefore \"the story is suspicious at best.\" Vorenberg suggests that although Lincoln might have expressed his preference for \"gradual emancipation\", he would not have sought to portray this option as legally or politically possible. William C. Harris also doubts the 'prospective ratification' story, on the grounds that this offer is not mentioned by Campbell in his 1865 letter to Curtis. James McPherson suggests: \"It is probable that Stephens was reading his own viewpoint into Seward's remarks.\"\n\nAccording to David Herbert Donald, Lincoln and Seward may have offered olive branches to the Confederates based on their sense that the institution of slavery was doomed and would end regardless. Relenting on the slavery issue might thus have prevented unnecessary warfare. Seward biographer Walter Stahr supports this inevitability theory, confirming that Seward would have accepted delay in ratification in order to end the war. Ludwell H. Johnson theorizes that peace negotiations reflected Lincoln's efforts to consolidate political power by creating \"a new conservative coalition which would include Southerners\". Johnson argues that negotiations would have built support among Northern Democrats as well as nascent Southern governments.\n\nCongress debated a resolution asking Lincoln to provide a report on the Conference. Willard Salisbury introduced an amendment stipulating that Lincoln reveal the precise terms he had offered. Salisbury's amendment failed and the resolution passed. Lincoln released a set of documents which met with an exceptionally positive reaction from Congress.\n\nDavis portrayed the conference in harsh terms, saying that Lincoln had demanded unconditional surrender and that the Confederacy must continue to fight. Some historians argue that Davis entered the Conference in bad faith in order to generate publicity around Northern hostility. Charles Sanders contends that Davis did not retain enough control over the negotiations to ensure they would serve his purpose, writing: \"If Davis's motive, therefore, was to discredit the 'croakers,' he was running the enormous political risk that the negotiations might actually succeed.\" Sanders also argues that if Davis had intended to sabotage the Conference, he would not have considered such prominent representatives as Lee or Stephens. Stephens left Richmond and went home to Georgia on February 9.\n\nLincoln followed through on his promise to pursue compensation, requesting amnesty and $400,000,000 for the Southern states if they ended armed resistance and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment. Soon after returning to Washington, Lincoln wrote an amnesty resolution offering pardons and the return of confiscated property \"except slaves\". The resolution stipulated that the Confederacy would receive $200,000,000 if it ceased \"resistance to national authority\" before April 1, 1865, and $200,000,000 more for successful ratification of the Thirteenth amendment before July 1, 1865.\n\nThese terms were unpopular, particularly with Lincoln's (relatively Radical) cabinet, and no such resolution was adopted. The \"New York Herald\" reported that Seward had been seeking a peace agreement in order to bolster a new coalition of conservative Republicans and Democrats; \"that Secretary Seward seized upon the movement to secure whatever \"éclat\" there might be connected with it, in hopes that if peace was the result he would be able to ride upon the wave of joy of a grateful people, and thus become the standard bearer of the great conservative party in 1868.\" (Johnson's \"Presidential Reconstruction\" would achieve some of these goals by other means.)\n\nCampbell continued to push a peace settlement within the CSA, writing to John C. Breckinridge on March 5 that \"The South may succomb [\"sic.\"] but it is not necessary that she should be destroyed.\" Campbell was the only member of the Confederate government to stay in Richmond after it fell to the Union. He met twice with Lincoln to discuss the future of the South. On April 5, Lincoln delivered the following message in writing:\n\nAccording to Campbell, Lincoln said he would be willing to pardon most Confederates other than \"Jeff Davis\". Campbell pushed the peace terms advanced by Lincoln, but his letter to the CSA published on April 11 was undercut by Lee's Appomattox surrender on April 9.\n\nCampbell was subsequently arrested under suspicion of conspiring to assassinate Lincoln, when his initials were discovered on an incriminating document.\n\nThe film \"Lincoln\" (2012) includes a brief dramatization of the conference, focusing on the slavery aspect and the desire of the Confederates to block adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment if re-admitted to the Union. Neither Lincoln nor Seward suggests any compromise on slavery, and Lincoln describes slavery as \"done\" and the Thirteenth Amendment as certain to be ratified.\n\nThe conference also makes an appearance in Jeff Shaara's novel \"The Last Full Measure\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1889154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889154", "title": "Chinese marriage", "text": "Chinese marriage\n\nTraditional Chinese marriage (), as opposed to marriage in modern China, is a ceremonial ritual within Chinese societies that involve a union between spouses, sometimes established by pre-arrangement between families. Within Chinese culture, romantic love and monogamy was the norm for most citizens.\n\nIn more ancient writings for the word 婚姻, the former has the radical 昏 (pinyin: hūn, literally \" dusk, nightfall, twilight, dark\") beside the radical 女 (pinyin: nǚ, literally \"a female\"). This implies that the wedding ceremony is typically performed in the evening, which is deemed as a time of fortune. Similarly, 姻 (pinyin: yīn) has the same pronunciation as 因 (pinyin: yīn). According to Zhang Yi's (張揖) \"Guangya Shigu\" (廣雅•釋詁), a dictionary of ancient Chinese characters, 因 (pinyin: yīn) means \"friendliness\", \"love\" and \"harmony\", indicating the correct way of living for a married couple.\n\nIn Confucian thought, marriage is of grave significance to both families and society, as well as being important for the cultivation of virtue. Traditionally incest has been defined as marriage between people with the same surname. From the perspective of a Confucian family, marriage brings together families of different surnames and continues the family line of the paternal clan. This is generally why giving birth to a boy is preferred over a girl. Therefore, the benefits and demerits of any marriage are important to the entire family, not just the individual couples. Socially, the married couple is thought to be the basic unit of society. In Chinese history there have been many times when marriages have affected the country's political stability and international relations. During the Han Dynasty, the rulers of the powerful Xiongnu tribe demanded women from the imperial family. Many periods of Chinese history were dominated by the families of the wife or mother of the ruling emperor.\n\nIn modern Chinese thinking, people in \"primitive\" societies did not marry, but had sexual relationships with one another indiscriminately. Such people were thought to live like animals, and they did not have the precise concept of motherhood, fatherhood, sibling, husband and wife, and gender, not to mention match-making and marriage ceremony. Part of the Confucian \"civilizing mission\" was to define what it meant to be a Father or a Husband, and to teach people to respect the proper relationship between family members and regulate sexual behavior.\n\nThe story about the marriage of sister and brother Nüwa and Fu Xi told how they invented proper marriage procedures after marrying. At that time the world was unpopulated, so the siblings wanted to get married but, at the same time, they felt ashamed. So they went up to Kunlun Mountains and prayed to the heavens. They asked for permission for their marriage and said, \"if you allow us to marry, please make the mist surround us.\" The heavens gave permission to the couple, and promptly the peak was covered in mist. It is said that in order to hide her shyness, Nüwa covered her blushing face with a fan. Nowadays in some villages in China, the brides still follow the custom and use a fan to shield their faces.\n\nEndogamy among different classes in China were practiced, the upper class like the Shi class married among themselves, while commoners married among themselves also, avoiding marriage with slaves and other ordinary people. This practice was enforced under the law.\n\nIn a maternal marriage, a male would become a son-in-law who lived in the wife's home. This happened in the transformation of antithetic marriage into monogamy, which signified the decline of matriarchy and the growing dominance of patriarchy in ancient China.\n\nEven though Muslim women are forbidden to marry non-Muslims in Islamic law, from 1880-1949 it was frequently violated in Xinjiang since Chinese men married Muslim Turki (Uyghur) women, a reason suggested by foreigners that it was due to the women being poor, while the Turki women who married Chinese were labelled as whores by the Turki community, these marriages were illegitimate according to Islamic law but the women obtained benefits from marrying Chinese men since the Chinese defended them from Islamic authorities so the women were not subjected to the tax on prostitution and were able to save their income for themselves. Chinese men gave their Turki wives privileges which Turki men's wives did not have, since the wives of Chinese did not have to wear a veil and a Chinese man in Kashgar once beat a mullah who tried to force his Turki Kashgari wife to veil. The Turki women also benefited in that they were not subjected to any legal binding to their Chinese husbands so they could make their Chinese husbands provide them with as much their money as she wanted for her relatives and herself since otherwise the women could just leave, and the property of Chinese men was left to their Turki wives after they died. Turki women considered Turki men to be inferior husbands to Chinese and Hindus. Because they were viewed as \"impure\", Islamic cemeteries banned the Turki wives of Chinese men from being buried within them, the Turki women got around this problem by giving shrines donations and buying a grave in other towns. Besides Chinese men, other men such as Hindus, Armenians, Jews, Russians, and Badakhshanis intermarried with local Turki women. The local society accepted the Turki women and Chinese men's mixed offspring as their own people despite the marriages being in violation of Islamic law. Turki women also conducted temporary marriages with Chinese men such as Chinese soldiers temporarily stationed around them as soldiers for tours of duty, after which the Chinese men returned to their own cities, with the Chinese men selling their mixed daughters with the Turki women to his comrades, taking their sons with them if they could afford it but leaving them if they couldn't, and selling their temporary Turki wife to a comrade or leaving her behind.\n\nMarriages during this time included a number of mandatory steps, of which the most important of them was the presentation of betrothal gifts from the groom and his family to the bride and her family. The bride's family then countered with a dowry. Sometimes the bride's family would buy goods with the betrothal money. Using a betrothal gift for family financial needs rather than saving it for the bride was viewed as dishonorable because it appeared as though the bride has been sold. A marriage without a dowry or a betrothal gifts was also seen as dishonorable. The bride was seen as a concubine instead of a wife. Once all the goods were exchanged the bride was taken to the ancestral home of the groom. There she was expected to obey her husband and his living relatives. Women continued to belong to their husband's families even if they had passed. If the widow's birth family wanted her to marry again, they would often have to ransom her back from her deceased husband's family. If they had any children they stayed with his family.\n\nIn the Ming period, marriage was considered solemn and according to the law written in The Ming Code (Da Ming Lü), all commoners’ marriages must follow the rules written in Duke Wen's Family Rules (Wen Gong Jia Li). The rules stated that “in order to arrange a marriage, an agent must come and deliver messages between the two families.” A marriage broker had the license to play important roles by arranging marriages between two families. Sometimes both families were influential and wealthy and the matchmaker bonded the two families into powerful households. Studies have shown that, “In the Ming and Qing dynasties, a number of noble families emerged in Jiaxing of Zhejiang, where marriage is the most important way to expand their clan strength.” Hence, marriage brokers were crucial during the Ming era, which offered us an insight of the lives of the Ming commoners.\n\nInstead of using the more gender general term “mei ren” (媒人), texts more frequently referred to marriage brokers as “mei po” (媒婆). Since “Po” (婆) translates to “grannies”in English, we can see that elderly female characters dominated the “marriage market”. Indeed, in the novel The Golden Lotus (Jing Ping Mei), the four matchmakers Wang, Xue, Wen, Feng were all elderly female characters. In ancient China, people believed that marriages belong to the “Yin” side (the opposite is “Yang”), which corresponds to females. In order to maintain the balance between Yin and Yang, women should not interfere with the Yang side and men should not interfere with the Yin side. Since breaking the balance may lead to disorder and misfortune, men were rarely seen in marriage arrangements. Furthermore, unmarried girls were not in the occupation because they themselves knew little about marriage and were not credible in arranging marriages. As a result, almost all marriage brokers in the literary work were presented as elderly females.\n\nBeing a successful marriage broker required various special skills. Firstly, the broker must be very persuasive. The broker must persuade both sides of the marriage that the arrangement was impeccable, even though many times the arrangement was actually not perfect. In Feng Menglong's “Old Man Zhang Grows Melons and Marries Wennü” in the collection Stories Old and New (Gu Jin Xiao Shuo), he wrote about an eighty-year-old man who married an eighteen-year young girl. The marriage was arranged by two matchmakers, Zhang and Li. Given the age difference, the marriage seemed impossible, but the two brokers still managed to persuade the father of the girl to marry her to the old man. Feng Menglong described them as “Once they start to speak the match is successfully arranged, and when they open their mouths they only spoke about harmony.” The brokers gave powerful persuasions by avoiding about mentioning the differences between the couples they arranged. Which, only speak about the positive side. In addition to persuasion techniques, the brokers must possess great social skills. They needed to know a network of people so that when the time comes for marriage, they were able to seek the services of the brokers. Finally, when someone came to the broker, she must be able to pick out a matching suitors according to her knowledge of the local residents. Normally a perfect couple must have similar social status, economic status, and age. Sometimes they even need to travel to neighboring towns for a match, hence the verse “Traveling to the east household, traveling to the west household, their feet are always busy and their voices are always loud.” Furthermore, mediators are required to know some mathematics and simple characters in order to write the matrimonial contract. The contract included “the sum of the bride price, the identity and age of both partners, and the identity of the person who presided over the wedding ceremony, usually the parents or grandparents.” Without the knowledge of math and simple written characters, composing such a detailed contract would be impossible.\n\nThe matchmakers made a living not only by facilitating successful marriage arrangements, but also by delivering messages between the two families. When they visited the households to deliver messages, the hosts usually provided them food and drinks to enjoy, hence the verse “Asking for a cup of tea, asking for a cup of alcohol, their faces are 3.3 inches thick (they are really cheeky).” However, these “visiting payments” were tiny compared to the payment they receive for a successful marriage. The visiting payment was always measured by “wen” or cash. Whereas, the final payment was measured by “liang” or taels, and one wen was equivalent to a thousand taels. Therefore, the brokers would spend most of their time travelling back and forth between the two households to persuade them of the marriage. In addition, the matchmakers receive payments for introducing young girls to wealthy men. In Zhang Dai's diary The Dream Collection of Taoan (Taoan Meng Yi), he described a scene in which matchmakers brought young beautiful girls to the houses of wealthy customers to choose. Even if the customer was not satisfied he would reward the matchmaker several hundreds wen.\n\nAs marriage brokers, these grannies also possessed the “guilty knowledge” of secret affairs. In The Golden Lotus (Jing Ping Mei), the matchmaker Wang speculated that Ximen Qing was fond of the married woman Pan Jinlian, so she introduced Pan to Ximen, helped them to have an affair and hide the secret for them. According to the law married woman must be loyal to her husband, and anyone who discovered an affair of the woman should report her immediately. Although, the matchmakers were licensed to keep secrets about affairs because keeping privacy of their clients was their obligation. Even so, they were usually criticized for doing so. In The Golden Lotus Wang was blamed for egging ladies on having improper affairs.\n\nChinese marriage became a custom between 402 and 221 BC. Despite China's long history and many different geographical areas, there are essentially six rituals, generally known as the three letters and six etiquettes (三書六禮). Unfortunately for some traditional families, the wife's mother cannot go to her son-in-law's family until one year (according to the Chinese lunar calendar or Chinese Lunar New Year) after the wedding has elapsed. However, during this one year the daughter can go back at any time.\n\n\nSince the late 1990s, it has become popular to create an elaborate wedding album, often taken at a photography studio. The album usually consists of many pictures of the bride and groom taken at various locations with many different outfits. In Singapore, these outfits often include wedding outfits belonging to different cultures, including Arab and Japanese wedding outfits. In contrast to Western wedding pictures, the Chinese wedding album will not contain pictures of the actual ceremony and wedding itself.\n\nIn Mandarin Chinese, a \"mang nian\" \"盲年“, or 'blind year', when there are no first days of spring, such as in year 2010, a Year of the Tiger, is considered an ominous time to marry or start a business. In the preceding year, there were two first days of spring.\n\nIn recent years, Confucian wedding rituals have become popular among Chinese couples. In such ceremonies, which are a recent innovation with no historic antecedent, the bride and groom bow and pay respects to a large portrait of Confucius hanging in the banquet hall while wedding attendants and the couple themselves are dressed in traditional Chinese robes.\n\nBefore the bride and groom enter the nuptial chambers, they exchange nuptial cups and perform ceremonial bows as follows:\n\nIn traditional Chinese society, there are three major ways to dissolve a marriage.\n\nThe first one is no-fault divorce. According to the Tang Code, the legal code of the Tang Dynasty (618-907), a marriage may be dissolved due to personal incompatibility, provided that the husband writes a divorce note.\n\nThe second way (義绝) is through state-mandated annulment of marriage. This applies when one spouse commits a serious crime (variously defined, usually more broadly for the wife) against the other or his/her clan. If the couple does not take the initiative to divorce when arose the situation of (義绝), the state will intervene to force them to divorce. If one side refused to divorce, the law must investigate the criminal liability of the party with a one-year prison sentence. Once a divorce is adjudged, they must not be reunited.\n\nThe third way of Chinese divorce process is (和離). It is a way that both husband and wife can have the power to divorce. However, It requires both of their agreement. In Chinese Marriage, this way of divorce is to ensure both husband and wife have the equal power to protect themselves, such as their property. It also enhanced the concept of responsibility in Chinese marriage. Divorce is a responsibility to each other. So, the country or the government won't intervene the divorce most of the time.\n\nFinally, the husband may unilaterally declare a divorce. To be legally recognized, it must be based on one of the following seven reasons (七出):\n\n\nThere are, however, three clearly defined exceptions (三不去), under which unilateral divorce is forbidden despite the presence of any of the seven aforementioned grounds:\n\n\nThe above law about unilateral divorce was in force from Tang Dynasty up to its final abolition in the Republic of China's Civil Code (Part IV) Section 5, passed in 1930.\n\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, the country's new Marriage Law also explicitly provided for lawful divorces. Women were permitted to divorce their husbands and many did, sparking resistance from rural males especially. Kay Ann Johnson reported that tens of thousands of women in north central China were killed for seeking divorces or committed suicide when blocked from doing so.\n\nDuring the Mao era (1949–1976) divorce was rare, but in the reform era, it has become easier and more commonplace. A USC U.S.-China Institute article reports that the divorce rate in 2006 was about 1.4/1000 people, about twice what it was in 1990 and more than three times what it was in 1982. Still, the divorce rate in China is less than half what it is in the United States. One of the most important breakthroughs in the marriage institution were amendments added to the Marriage Law in 2001, which shortened the divorce-application procedure and added legitimate reasons for divorce, such as emphasizing the importance of faithfulness within a married couple, a response to rising failure of marriages due to unfaithful affairs during marriage that have come into public knowledge. With the rising divorce rates nowadays, public discussions and governmental organs often criticize the lack of effort in marriage maintenance which many couples express. This is evident, for example in the new 'divorce buffer zones' established in the marriage registration offices in certain provinces, which is a room where the couples wait, as a stage within the divorce application procedure, and are encouraged to talk things over and consider giving their marriage another chance. However, such phenomena don't contradict the increasing permissiveness of the systems and of married couples which lead to the constant growth in divorce rates in China.\n\nAmendments have also been made to Article 32 of the revised 2001 Marriage Law. Parties to a marriage can apply for Divorce under, and by showing, the following grounds:\n\n\nIn ancient China, women's social status was not as good as men. A woman could only obey and rely on her husband; if her husband was dead, she could remarry but would be seen as not decent. While a man could have though only one wife but many concubines and marry someone else as new wife if the wife passed away before him. The general dignitaries also had only one wife but many concubines.\n\nSororate marriage is a custom in which a man marries his wife's sister(s). Later it is expanded to include her cousins or females from the same clan. The Chinese name is 妹媵 (妹=younger sister, 媵=co-bride/concubinage). It can happen at the same time as he marries the first wife, at a later time while the wife is still alive, or after she dies. This practice occurred frequently among the nobility of the Zhou Dynasty (1045 BC – 256 BC), with cases occurring at later times.\n\nBeside the traditional desire for male children to carry on the family name, this allowance partially resolves a dilemma created by the emperor himself. He had recently banned all non-patrilineal forms of inheritance, while wanting to preserve the proper order in the Chinese kinship. Therefore, a couple without son cannot adopt one from within the extended family. They either have to adopt from outside (which was regarded by many as passing the family wealth to unrelated \"outsiders\"), or become heirless. The multiple inheritance marriages provided a way out when the husband's brother has a son.\n\nThe custom of \"ruzhui\" (入赘) applied when a relatively wealthy family had no male heirs, while a poorer family had multiple male children. Under these circumstances, a male from the poorer family, generally a younger sibling, will marry into the wealthier family in order to continue their family line. In a \"ruzhui\" (lit., 'the [man] becoming superfluous') marriage, the children will take on the surname of the wife.\n\nWomen in concubinage (妾) were treated as inferior, and expected to be subservient to the wife (if there was one). The women were not wedded in a whole formal ceremony, had less right in the relationship, and could be divorced arbitrarily. They generally came from lower social status or were bought as slaves. Women who had eloped may have also become concubines since a formal wedding requires her parents' participation.\n\nThe number of concubines was sometime regulated, which differs according to the men's rank. In ancient China, men of higher social status often supported several concubines, and Chinese emperors almost always had dozens of, even hundreds of royal concubines.\n\nDespite the limitations imposed on ancient Chinese concubines, history and literature have examples of concubines achieving great power and influence. For example, in one of the Four Great Classical Novels of China, \"The Dream of the Red Chamber\" (believed to be a semi-autobiographical account of author Cao Xueqin's own family life), three generations of the Jia family are supported by one favorite concubine of the emperor.\n\nImperial concubines, kept by emperors in the Forbidden City, were traditionally guarded by eunuchs to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the emperor. Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as Empress Dowager Cixi, was arguably one of the most successful concubines in China's history. Cixi first entered the court as a concubine to the Xianfeng Emperor and gave birth to an illegitimate male heir, who would become the Tongzhi Emperor. The emperor passed over many legitimate male heirs and named Cixi's son the crown prince. She would eventually become the \"de facto\" ruler of the Manchu Qing Dynasty in China for 47 years after her son's death.\n\nA somewhat different form of it is the so-called \"two primary wives\" (兩頭大). Traditionally, a married woman is expected to live with her husband's family. When the husband has to live away from his family, however, she has to stay with her in-laws and take care of them. A man who thus suffers chronic separation from his wife, such as a traveling merchant, may \"marry\" another woman where he lives and set up a separate household with her. Due to the geographical separation, the second woman often regards herself as a full wife for all practical matters, yet legally this marriage is not recognized, and she is treated as a concubine. In China specifically, in cases where the primary wife fails to have sons to preserve the male lineage, i.e. family name, a secondary wife is allowed by law via the sing-song girls concept.\n\nAlthough modern Chinese law explicitly prohibits polygamy, there has been a recent surge of polygamy in mainland China. Since the opening of China's borders in the 1970s, businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan started setting up \"secondary wives\" (二奶, er nai) in the Mainland. Since then the practice has spread to local affluent men. Someone considered as 二奶 would receive more privileges than another woman regarded as 小三 (xiao san), a term reserved for a mere mistress rather than a role more akin to second wife or concubine. Although this practice is condemned throughout society many men still have 二奶 and 小三, which can cause conflict and trauma, just as it would in western countries.\n\nSome juries in China consider married people who leave home to live with their lovers to have committed bigamy.\n\nHowever most law cases filed were before 2000, and the situation does not really differ from that in western countries. People will not get prosecuted for \"bigamy\" for out-of-marriage relationships as long as they do not register another marriage, but might be required to cede more possessions in divorce cases involving a former wife.\n\nPolyandry, the practice of one woman having multiple husbands, is traditionally considered by Han as immoral, prohibited by law, and uncommon in practice. However, historically there have been instances in which a man in poverty rents or pawns his wife temporarily. However amongst other Chinese ethnicities polyandry existed and exists, especially in mountainous areas.\n\nIn a subsistence economy, when available land could not support more than one family, dividing it between surviving sons would eventually lead to a situation in which none would have the resources to survive; in such a situation a family would together marry a wife, who would be the wife of all the brothers in the family. Polyandry in certain Tibetan autonomous areas in modern China remains legal. This however only applies to the ethnic minority Tibetans of the region and not to other ethnic groups.\n\n\n18.

Neilsen's son, Craig, assumed control of day-to-day operations upon the elder Neilsen's death in 1971. Craig H. Neilsen became sole owner in 1984.\n\nA November 1985 automobile accident left Craig H. Neilsen a quadriplegic, but he continued to lead the company and expanded it. Neilsen was named “Best Performing CEO” by the American Gaming Association in 2002, and was inducted into the organization’s “Hall of Fame” in 2005. Craig H. Neilsen remained chairman and CEO until his unexpected death on November 19, 2006.\n\nRay H. Neilsen succeeded his father, serving as co-chairman with John Boushy, who also was promoted from president to CEO at the time of Craig’s death. Boushy resigned in June 2008 and was succeeded by Gordon Kanofsky, who previously served as the company's executive vice president, and now holds the dual role of CEO and vice chairman. Ray H. was named chairman at the same time.\n\nIn August 2013, Pinnacle Entertainment bought Ameristar for $869 million plus $1.9 billion in assumed debt. The company had reportedly been \"on the sales block\" since Craig Neilsen's death.\n\nIn 1992 the company made its first investment outside of Jackpot by acquiring a Vicksburg, Mississippi, property known as Delta Pointe. This property was opened in 1994 as Ameristar Casino Vicksburg. The company subsequently constructed an adjoining hotel, and in 2008, completed a $100 million expansion of the facility. Ameristar opened the first of several riverboat casinos in Council Bluffs, Iowa, in 1996. In 1998, the company opened the Reserve Hotel Casino in Henderson, Nevada.\n\nThe company was renamed Ameristar Casinos, Inc. and went public in 1993, on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"ASCA.\" Company headquarters was moved from Twin Falls to Las Vegas in 1996.\n\nIn 2000, Ameristar purchased properties in Kansas City, Missouri, and St. Charles, Missouri, from Station Casinos, Inc., and in 2001, sold The Reserve Hotel and Casino to Station Casinos, which renamed it Fiesta Henderson.\n\nIn 2004, Ameristar acquired the Mountain High Casino in Black Hawk, Colorado. In 2006, the Ameristar brand debuted after an $80 million renovation and expansion project that included additional covered parking; and announced details of its planned 33-story hotel and spa. Ameristar officially opened its new Casino Resort Spa complex October 2009 to become the first destination resort casino in Colorado. The property's $230 million expansion included a 33-story luxury hotel and day spa, an enclosed rooftop swimming pool and of meeting and event space. The 33-story hotel featuring 536 rooms and 64 suites became the tallest structure between Salt Lake City, Utah and Denver.\n\nAmeristar also completed the acquisition of the Resorts East Chicago casino in East Chicago, Indiana from Resorts International Holdings in 2007. It was rebranded Ameristar Casino Hotel East Chicago in June 2008. An outdoor summer concert series promoted the rebranding, and featured Lionel Richie, Smokey Robinson and Reba McEntire.\n\nIn 2010, Ameristar announced plans to renovate all of Ameristar East Chicago's 280 superior guest rooms and 10 luxury suites; and to add 100 rooms and a fitness center to Ameristar Kansas City's existing luxury hotel. The addition will complement the property's existing 184 rooms and hotel lobby, which were extensively renovated in September 2006.\n\nIn Massachusetts, where casinos were legalized in November 2011, Ameristar applied for the one gaming license allotted to Western Massachusetts, proposing to build a $910-million hotel and casino. It acquired a 41-acre site in East Springfield, a former Westinghouse plant, for $16 million. In November 2012, however, Ameristar withdrew its proposal in the face of competing bids from MGM Resorts International and Penn National Gaming, saying that city officials were more likely to endorse a downtown casino.\n\nIn March 2012, Ameristar agreed to acquire Creative Casinos, developer of the proposed Mojito Pointe casino resort in Lake Charles, Louisiana, for $32.5 million. Ameristar planned to spend at least $500 million on the resort, and to open it in mid-2014.\n\nFollowing the death of Craig H. Neilsen, his estate endowed the foundation in his name. Ameristar regularly partners with the Craig H. Neilsen Foundation to support the rehabilitation of individuals suffering from spinal cord injuries and disease. Ray H. Neilsen serves as Chairman, and Co-Trustee with Kanofsky. In addition, Ameristar was one of the first companies to help fund research at the Nevada Cancer Institute by making a $500,000 donation in 2004.\n\nAmeristar also sponsors an active workplace giving campaign known as Ameristar Cares. In 2012, the company and its employees raised almost $7 million for charitable organizations.\n\nAlthough the current economic recession has hurt the financial performance of casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, Ameristar and other regional casino operators have fared better, as customers opt for gaming and entertainment destinations closer to home.\n\nAmeristar's properties in Kansas City and St. Charles, Missouri, and Black Hawk, Colorado, benefitted from casino-related regulatory reform approved by voters in 2008-09. In Missouri, voters repealed the state’s loss limit, which had capped players’ purchases of table game chips and slot machine credits at $500 every two hours. In Black Hawk, voters approved a measure that increased betting limits and operating hours, and added the games of craps and roulette.\n\nAmeristar’s properties at the time it was acquired were:\n\n"}

She first achieved notoriety in August 1964, when she attended the film premiere of \"London in the Raw\", wearing a topless dress.\n\nJones began her show-business career as a cabaret artist in late 1950s London. She performed first at the Windmill Theatre, and later in clubs in Mayfair and elsewhere in London. \n\nShe began recording songs and embarked on another career as a pop singer in the 1960s, her greatest success coming in 1966 with the novelty song \"Witches Brew\" which was her first single and peaked at number 46 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nSubsequent releases failed to have any impact in the UK charts, but were all collected together and released on the compilation album 'We're in Love with the World of Janie Jones' in 1997.\n\nAt the height of her fame as a singer, Jones appeared on various television programmes, including \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" and \"Mike and Bernie's Show\" .\n\nAfter being released from prison, she still made occasional appearances on the small screen including \"The Russell Harty Show\", where she sang two songs in 1977, the BBC's \"The Time of Your Life\" in 1984, where she appeared in a reconstruction of the Summer of 1964, and \"The James Whale Radio Show\", in an episode focusing on the theme of Scandal in 1990.\n\n\nThe cabaret singer was sentenced to seven years imprisonment (serving three years) in 1974 for her involvement in 'controlling prostitutes'.\n\nWhilst in jail, she met and befriended the Moors murderer Myra Hindley and made numerous television appearances insisting that Hindley was a reformed woman and should be considered for release. However Jones developed a deep hatred for Hindley in 1986 when Hindley finally confessed to her crimes. In 1993 she wrote an autobiography titled \"The Devil and Miss Jones: The Twisted Mind of Myra Hindley\".\n\nShe is the subject of a song by The Clash called \"Janie Jones\", which was released in 1977 on the band's eponymous debut album.

It is the seat of the Metropolitan Province of Louisville, which comprises the states of Kentucky and Tennessee. The cathedral church of the archdiocese is the Cathedral of the Assumption.\n\nThe Diocese began in 1808 when the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bardstown centered in Bardstown, Kentucky, which was then a thriving frontier settlement. It was established along with the dioceses of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia by Pope Pius VII, (1742–1823, served 1800–1823), out of the territory of the Diocese of Baltimore, the first Catholic diocese in the United States, which was first \"erected\" (established) in 1789 with the first bishop in the US, John Carroll, who was ordained/consecrated in Britain in 1790. Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the U.S. in April 2008 celebrated the 200th anniversary of the creation of these wider dioceses and the elevation of Baltimore to an archdiocese (known as \"The Premier See\"). When founded, the Bardstown Diocese included most of the new states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan—the western territories of America to the Mississippi River and the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.\n\nWhile Louisville is the oldest inland diocese in the United States, it is not the oldest west of the Appalachians. That distinction belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans founded under Spanish rule in 1793, and which territory as part of the Louisiana Purchase became a part of the US in 1803, and Louisiana admitted as a state in 1812.\n\nBenedict Joseph Flaget was the first Bishop of Bardstown. The historic Basilica of Saint Joseph Proto-Cathedral, the former cathedral of the Diocese of Bardstown, is now a parish church, and a national historic site.\n\nWhile the French may have had initial influence in the formation of the Roman Catholic community in the Louisville area, eventually immigrants from Germany comprised the bulk of the Archdiocese's communicant strength later in the mid-19th century, particularly in the city of Louisville. However, much of the Catholic population in areas southeast of Louisville is of English extraction, consisting of descendants of recusants who originally settled in Maryland in colonial times.\n\nIn 1841, the diocese was moved from Bardstown to Louisville, becoming the Diocese of Louisville. The Diocese of Louisville was elevated in 1937 to become the Archdiocese of Louisville, and the \"metropolitan\" (supervising) province for all the dioceses in Kentucky and Tennessee with an Archbishop of Louisville. There are currently three deaneries: Elizabethtown, Lebanon, and Bardstown.\n\nAs of 2018, the archdiocese contains approximately 200,000 Catholics in 66,000 households, served by one hundred twenty-two parishes and missions. One half of all Catholics in the Commonwealth reside within the bounds of the Archdiocese of Louisville, and seventy-nine percent of all Catholics in the archdiocese (forty percent of all Catholics in the Commonwealth) reside in the Louisville Metro area. There are fifty-nine Catholic elementary and high schools serving more than 23,400 students. The archdiocese is home to one hundred sixty-six diocesan priests, one hundred twelve permanent deacons, fifty-two religious institute priests, seventy-seven religious brothers, and nine hundred forty-four religious sisters. The archdiocese serves more than 220,000 persons in Catholic hospitals, health care centers, homes for the aged, and specialized homes. Services, mother-infant care program, senior social services, and rural ministries services.\n\nThe lists of bishops and their years of service:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Catholic secondary schools serve more than 6,300 students. Eight of the schools are located in Jefferson County and one in Nelson County. Four of the schools enroll only girls, three enroll only boys, and two are coeducational.\n\n\n\n\n\nForty Catholic parish, regional, and special elementary schools serve more than 15,500 students in seven counties of the Archdiocese of Louisville.\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Province of Louisville covers the states of Kentucky and Tennessee, and comprises the following dioceses:\n\nIn 2003, the Archdiocese of Louisville paid $25.7 million directly from its own assets to settle claims of sexual abuse by its clergy. Reports of abuse extended back to the 1940s, were alleged to have continued to 1997, and involved 34 priests, two religious brothers, and three lay people. In 2009, the Diocese of Covington paid 243 victims an average of $254,000 after they were victimized by 35 priests. The total settlement, $79 million, was the sixth largest in the US (as of 2017).\n\nIn 2019, Father Joseph Hemmerle, who was convicted in 2016 for molesting a ten-year-old boy while serving at the Camp Tall Trees summer camp in 1973, lost a bid for appeal. Hemmerle, who was also denied parole in 2017, is serving a seven-year prison sentence for this crime, which was recommended following his conviction. In 2017, he received an additional two years after pleading guilty to molesting another boy at Camp Tall Trees in 1977 and 1978.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1889185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889185", "title": "Worlds of Power", "text": "Worlds of Power\n\nThe Worlds of Power books are a series of novelizations of video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System released in the early 1990s by Scholastic. The series was created by Seth Godin and take creative liberties with their source material. They usually include game hints written upside down at the end of chapters (some also had a tear-out \"trading card\" in the middle with a tip in mirror writing on the back) and are written in a simplistic, easy-to-read style.\n\nBooks in the series consist of novelizations of \n\nJunior Edition Books\n\n\nThe producer of the series, Seth Godin, used the pen name \"F.X. Nine.\" Godin said one day that when he talked to his nephew he discovered that the boy did not read for pleasure. Instead the boy played NES games. Godin decided to create books that appealed to children who played video games. Godin, the head of a book packaging company, created the series idea, selected games to novelize, found writers for the books, and contacted the publisher for approval. Nintendo negotiated with Godin but negotiations failed. The other video game creators successfully negotiated and Scholastic Books approved the project. \"1up.com\" described Godin's role in publishing as \"similar to that of a movie producer in the film industry.\"\n\nThe video game companies did not assist Godin as they were too busy. Godin set the production schedule, selected the video games, and selected the authors. Then he set to create one 40-page \"bible\" for each game outlining the plot, characters, and level layouts to assist the authors' creation of the dialog and narratives. \"1up.com\" stated that assembling the bibles was \"quite a challenge.\" Godin and the authors played through the games without strategy guides in order to reverse-engineer the stories. All of the books were indexed by Godin's pen name; Godin said that he chose the pen name due to the way bookstores arrange books as children looking for books related Nintendo would see Godin's books indexed by the letters \"n-i-n.\" Godin said that his most serious frustration was playing video games for too long, as he would experience headaches. He added that the success of the \"Worlds of Power\" series outweighed the drawbacks; around one million copies of the books were sold. \"1up.com\" added that this was \"especially remarkable\" as the target audience, young boys, were not considered to be a large market for book series. Godin said \"We sold a million copies to kids that may not have read for fun before. That's a huge success (and) a home run!\"\n\nOne author, Peter Lerangis, used the pen name \"A.L. Singer\" and wrote the novelizations of \"\", \"Blaster Master\", \"Infiltrator\", and \"Ninja Gaiden\". Godin approached Lerangis when the project began and asked Lerangis to be a writer for the project. Lerangis, who admitted a lack of skill in playing video games, took the offer. Lerangis wrote each book in about four weeks. One of Lerangis's two favorite books, \"Ninja Gaiden\", was one of the most popular books in the \"Worlds of Power\" series. He liked writing the book since he \"was able to get into the character's head pretty quickly,\" especially while writing the beginning. Lerangis said that the book reveals Ryu's father to be alive at the end since he and Godin believed that the revised ending was consistent with the \"Worlds of Power\" character and as real-life fathers they felt reluctance to leave Ryu without a father. \"Bases Loaded II: Second Season \", Lerangis's other favorite title, is considered to be more obscure. Lerangis liked baseball and, since the game had no plot, he created an original light comedy storyline; Lerangis said that \"Bases Loaded\" was the most fun book to write. Lerangis described \"Blaster Master\" as the most difficult book to write; since the game does not have a strong middle plot, Lerangis fleshed the story connected the beginning and ending of the games.\n\nGodin said that he would have liked to novelize the game \"Myst\", a personal computer game, into a book. He said that \"I think that stories never go out of style. I think we need a series like this now more than ever & kids need to learn the habit of reading\" and that \"I think the lesson of each book was that there is a hero in everyone. You just have to set it free.\"\n\n\"The Worlds of Power\" series omitted violent elements in the video games. Video game covers were adapted into the book covers after weaponry was omitted. For instance in \"Ninja Gaiden\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> cover, the dagger that Ryu Hayabusa held in front of him is no longer visible. In \"Metal Gear\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> cover, Solid Snake no longer holds his gun; \"1up.com\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Scott Sharkey said that without the gun, Snake was \"making a vaguely masturbatory gesture.\" Within the texts, death and violence were not inflicted on humans and animals. In the \"Blaster Master\" book, the bosses appearing like mutated animals are holographic projections placed on formless blobs. In the \"Metal Gear\" book, Snake—described as a \"walking arsenal\"—uses his guns only to pistol whip enemies. In the \"Ninja Gaiden\" book, Ryu Hayabusa's father—seemingly killed in the prologue of the game and said to be dead in earlier book chapters—is revealed as alive by the end of the book. In the \"Infiltrator\" book, an agent scheduled to be \"voided\" either has his memory wiped clean, receives exiling, or receives a demotion. In \"Bionic Commando\", the protagonist's gun shoots \"stun bullets\" and the protagonist uses karate chops to disable enemies. Towards the end of that book, a clone of Adolf Hitler kills the enemy leader; the protagonist feels no sympathy since the leader was, as stated by \"1up.com\", \"an evil man being eliminated by an even more evil man.\" In addition, overtly magical and occult references were omitted from the \"Before Shadowgate\" book.\n\nGodin described the editing as \"stylistic in nature\" and that he intended to \"minimize the death\" in the adapted games. He added that Scholastic asked him to remove witchcraft several years before the release of \"Harry Potter\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> first book, \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" (\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" in the United Kingdom), which was published by Scholastic in the United States.\n\nThe PlayStation game \"\", a sequel to the original \"Blaster Master\", canonized some of the original elements from Peter Lerangis' novelization of \"Blaster Master\". Particularly the character Eve, who was not in the NES game, appeared in \"Blasting Again\". Lerangis stated that he felt \"honored\" for the privilege. This change was carried over to Blaster Master Zero in 2017.\n\n"}
{"id": "1889193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889193", "title": "Tutu (album)", "text": "Tutu (album)\n\nTutu is an album by American jazz trumpeter Miles Davis, released in 1986 by Warner Bros. Records. It was recorded primarily at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles and Clinton Recording in New York, except the song \"Backyard Ritual\", which was recorded at Le Gonks in West Hollywood. Davis received the 1986 Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist Grammy Award for his performance on the album.\n\nOriginally planned as a collaboration with pop singer/songwriter Prince, Davis ultimately worked with bassist/multi-instrumentalist Marcus Miller. Miller wrote and arranged all the songs, except \"Tomaas\" (co-written by Davis), \"Backyard Ritual\" (by keyboardist George Duke), and \"Perfect Way\" (by pop group Scritti Politti). The music is strongly inspired by mid-1980s R&B and funk, with heavy use of synthesizers, sequencers, Jason Miles, and drum machines.\n\nAs indicated in the notes accompanying the album, \"Tutu\" was produced by Tommy LiPuma and Marcus Miller, with the exception of \"Backyard Ritual\", which was co-produced by Duke and LiPuma.\n\nThe cover was designed by Eiko Ishioka and photographed by Irving Penn. Eiko Ishioka received the 1987 Grammy Award for Best Album Package for her work as the art director. The original vinyl album featured a colored inner sleeve printed with the album credits on one side and a photograph of Davis's left hand (with middle finger depressed) on the reverse.\n\n\"Tutu\" divided critics and listeners when it was released in 1986. Like Davis's pivotal 1970 album \"Bitches Brew\", Paul Tingen wrote, \"Tutu\" became one of the \"defining jazz albums\" of its decade and attracted a young, new audience while alienating many other jazz listeners because of its heavy reliance on the drum machine and synthesizers. A number of critics felt the music was ingratiatingly elegant, designed for casual listening, and largely a work by Miller. In \"The New York Times\" that year, Robert Palmer said it \"already sounds curiously dated\" and unambitious, featuring synthesizers that \"have glutinous textures so overly familiar from the mainstream of late-1970s pop jazz\" and electronic rhythms lacking the innovation of contemporary hip hop records.\n\nOthers believed the album gave a musical setting for Davis's improvisations to thrive in, comparable to his orchestral recordings with Gil Evans from the late 1950s and early 1960s. \"The Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau deemed it a marginal success but also Davis's \"best in a decade\". He contended that while Davis's 1970s fusion recordings for Columbia Records were purely improvised jazz-rock, \"Tutu\" sounded \"more like pop-funk \"Sketches of Spain\", with the starperson's trumpet glancing smartly off an up-to-date panoply of catchy little tunes, beats, and rhythm effects\". Jazz musician and writer Mike Zwerin was more enthusiastic, hailing it as \"the best jazz record of the decade\".\n\nIn a retrospective piece, Christgau later wrote that with \"shlock\" like \"Tutu\" and \"Amandla\", Davis was taking advantage of the fusion movement he helped develop while showing \"gratifying groove and class\". In J. D. Considine's opinion, the album's compositions and improvisations endured well with the passage of time, even though its electronically processed and enigmatic music turned off jazz purists. Writing for \"Something Else!\" in 2006, S. Victor Aaron said the best song from \"Tutu\" may have been Davis's own composition \"Tomaas\": \"With a reggae beat married to repetitive single note underpinned by some very nifty bass work by Miller, Miles and Miller (also on soprano sax) trade fours and eights in a rare opportunity for Miles to stretch out. Overall, though, the trumpet playing is subdued, probably more constrained by production than declining abilities. Rarely does the mute come off his horn.\" Reviewing the album for \"Jazzwise\" in 2011, Davis' biographer George Cole said, \"\"Tutu\" was a product of the 80s, a decade where music was often in danger of becoming subservient to technology. But while much of the music from this era is now long forgotten; \"Tutu\" continues to thrive; artists such as George Benson, Al Jarreau and Cassandra Wilson have recorded cover versions of the title track.\"\n\nBetween May and August 2010, Miller performed on the \"Tutu Revisited\" concert tour with a band comprising Christian Scott on trumpet with Alex Han on saxophone, Federico González Peña on keyboards and Louis Cato on drums. In an interview for \"JazzTimes\", Miller said, \"I'm finding that although the music mirrored the times in which it was created, there is so much in the music that still seems relevant today. Although we've replaced some of the super electro sounding elements, the melodies are still very cool. It feels like they have withstood the test of time. People seem to be feeling this music twenty years later.\"\n\nAll tracks composed by Marcus Miller except where indicated:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was written by J. Michael Straczynski and directed by Jesús Salvador Treviño.\n\nThe movie was originally shown on July 19, 1998 on the TNT cable network, during the run of season five (originally being shown between \"Movements of Fire and Shadow\" and \"The Fall of Centauri Prime\"). In addition to members of the regular cast of the \"Babylon 5\" TV series, it features the notable guest-stars Shari Belafonte (playing Dr. Elizabeth Trent) and William Sanderson (reprising the role of \"Deuce\" that he played in the episode \"Grail\").\n\nThe horror-based story, which ties into the Shadow/Vorlon plotline, centers on the return of an ancient and overwhelming alien force which had once attempted to destroy life in the Milky Way.\n\nAn enormous artifact is discovered in hyperspace and is towed to \"Babylon 5\" for investigation. The xenoarchaeology corporation Interplanetary Expeditions sends a representative, Dr. Elizabeth Trent, to take control of the artifact's examination.\n\nThe artifact begins to influence the dreams of many inhabitants of \"Babylon 5\", eventually controlling many of them during their waking hours as well. These thralls, led by Deuce, first demand that the excavation be accelerated, and then become increasingly violent towards the rest of the \"Babylon 5\" population. Dr. Trent conjectures that the artifact is a Jumpgate that takes one neither to normal space nor to hyperspace but to a \"third\" space (hence the movie's title). With the reluctant support of her colleague, they order the device to be turned on, without notifying Captain Sheridan.\n\nSheridan and Delenn visit Lyta Alexander, who, transmitting a \"race memory\", explains that the gate was built by the Vorlons a million years ago with a purpose that cannot be expressed in human terms except as an attempt to make contact with the gods. The Vorlons discovered that Thirdspace is a parallel universe inhabited by a violent, telepathic alien species even older and more powerful than the Vorlons that is bent on exterminating all life other than their own.\n\nLong ago, the Thirdspace aliens telepathically converted a small army of Vorlons to fight and die for them. The ensuing battle ended in a stalemate; the non-thrall Vorlons shut down the gate, but the remaining Vorlon thralls prevented the artifact's destruction by sending it into hyperspace where it was lost but preserved (in hopes that it might one day be reawakened). Lyta then telepathically informs Captain Sheridan how to deactivate the gate.\n\nWhen the device is finally reactivated, the Thirdspace aliens stream out from the portal in small fighters and begin a devastating assault on \"Babylon 5\", obliterating large cruisers with little effort. The Thirdspace fleet is highly advanced and the single-occupant fighters possess deflector shield technology, making them extremely hard to destroy. The violent behavior of the individuals under the artifact's control is intended to disrupt the station's defenses. The struggle is ended when Sheridan uses a thermonuclear device to destroy the artifact just as the first wave of Thirdspace heavy warships begins to emerge. Once the artifact is destroyed, the telepathic influence stops and the station returns to normal. Trent, shaken by the way in which the artifact affected her, turns over her final report and goes on an indefinite hiatus.\n\nSheridan and the others conceal the true nature of the artifact from those who ask questions and confidently assure themselves that the incident is unlikely to occur again. In private, Lyta broods with the knowledge that the artifact was only one of many mistakes the Vorlons have made.\n\nThe central theme of \"Thirdspace\" is hubris. The artifact was created because of the Vorlons' belief that they were equal in power to the gods, a reference to the biblical story of the Tower of Babel.\n\n\nEssentially a stand-alone episode, the film is set after the Shadow War (episode 406 \"Into the Fire\") and before war was declared with Earth (episode 414 \"Moments of Transition\"). The presence of both Dr. Franklin and Delenn, along with changes to Zack Allan's uniform, further place the events just after episode 409 \"Atonement\", to the extent that its continuity problems can actually be resolved.\n\nWhile a stand-alone story, it does include a scene in which Zack Allan finally reveals his feelings outright to Lyta Alexander, unaware that she is being telepathically dominated and not hearing a word he says. This sheds some new light on their somewhat uncomfortable friendship and his jealousy of her relationship with another telepath, Byron, that would occur in Season 5.\n\nIn the season 5 episode \"The Fall of Centauri Prime\", Delenn (while talking to Lennier about themselves drifting in hyperspace) appears to refer obliquely to the events of this film by pondering, \"Who knows what's out there; maybe we'll find a million-year-old jumpgate left over by the First Ones.\"\n\nThe fictional artifact was designed by science fiction and fantasy artist Wayne Barlowe after the script was written. In the novelization, the description of the artifact does not match what appears in the film. Most notably, the artifact in the novel formed into a jump gate that was larger than the station when it became operational. In the film, however, it rearranged itself and actually decreased in size.\n\n"}
{"id": "1889206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889206", "title": "Slug test", "text": "Slug test\n\nA slug test is a particular type of aquifer test where water is quickly added or removed from a groundwater well, and the change in hydraulic head is monitored through time, to determine the near-well aquifer characteristics. It is a method used by hydrogeologists and civil engineers to determine the transmissivity/hydraulic conductivity and storativity of the material the well is completed in.\n\nThe slug of water can either be added to or removed from the well — the only requirement is that it be done as quickly as possible (the interpretation typically assumes instantaneously), then the water level or pressure is monitored. Depending on the properties of the aquifer and the size of the slug, the water level may return to pre-test levels very quickly (thus complicating accurate collection of water level data). \n\nA slug can be added by either quickly adding a measured amount of water to the well or something which displaces a measured volume (e.g., a long heavy pipe with the ends capped off). An alternative object is a solid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) rod, with sufficient weight to sink into the groundwater. The objective here is to displace water, not merely be \"heavy\". A slug of water can be removed using a bailer or pump, but this is more difficult to do since it must be done very quickly and the equipment for removing the water (pump or bailer) will likely be in the way of getting water level measurements.\n\nA slug test is in contrast to standard aquifer tests, which typically involve pumping a well at a constant flowrate, and monitoring the response of the aquifer in nearby monitoring wells. Often slug tests are performed instead of a constant rate test, because:\n\n\nThe size of the slug required is determined by the aquifer properties, the size of the well and the amount of time which is available for the test. For very permeable aquifers, the pulse will dissipate very quickly. If the well has a large diameter, a large volume of water must be added to increase the level in the well a measurable amount.\n\nBecause the flow rate into or out of the well is not constant, as is the case in a typical aquifer test, the standard Theis solution does not work. \n\nMathematically, the Theis equation is the solution of the groundwater flow equation for a step increase in discharge rate at the pumping well; a slug test is instead an instantaneous pulse at the pumping well. This means that a superposition (or more precisely a convolution) of an infinite number of sequential slug tests through time would effectively be a \"standard\" Theis aquifer test.\n\nThere are several known solutions to the slug test problem; a common engineering approximation is the Hvorslev method, which approximates the more rigorous solution to transient aquifer flow with a simple decaying exponential function.\n\nThe aquifer parameters obtained from a slug test are typically less representative of the aquifer surrounding the well than an aquifer test which involves pumping in one well and monitoring in another. Complications arise from near-well effects (i.e., well skin and wellbore storage), which may make it difficult to get accurate results from slug test interpretation.\n\n"}

He is a member of the Dominica Labour Party and served for a time as Minister for National Security, Immigration, Labour and the Public Service.\n\nFollowing the demise of the Patrick John government (in which Savarin played an integral role), Savarin was made Chairman of the Committee for National Salvation (CNS). This body comprising members of the greater cross section of Dominican Society, was tasked with overseeing the transition to an interim government.\n\nSavarin contested the 1980 General Elections on a Dominica Freedom Party ticket losing to Mike Douglas in a four way race. Savarin polled 405 votes to Douglas's 531 votes.\n\nIn 1983, Savarin was appointed as Minister without Portfolio in the Prime Minister's Office with special responsibility for Trade, Industry and Tourism.\n\nIn 1986, Savarin was appointed Ambassador/Permanent Representative to the European Union. He also served as principal ambassadorial spokesman for African/Caribbean/Pacific States on bananas. That assignment ended in 1993, when he returned to Dominica to become General Manager of the National Development Corporation (NDC).\n\nWhen Dame Eugenia Charles decided to walk away from politics, Savarin contested the Leadership of the Dominica Freedom Party losing to Brian Alleyne. He however replaced Dame Eugenia as the party's flag bearer in the Roseau Central Constituency. Savarin emerged victorious at the polls with some 1013 votes to Norris Prevo's 759. When Brian Alleyne resigned as DFP Leader and Leader of the Opposition in 1996, Savarin again entered the leadership race. On 20 April 1996, Savarin received 86 out of 107 votes at the party's General Council. He served as Leader of the DFP until 2007 where mounting criticism of his leadership forced him to resign.\n\nDuring his first term as Roseau Central MP Savarin championed the cause of \"equal educational opportunities\" for children in the Roseau catchment area. He was again re-elected as MP for Roseau in the 2000 General elections this time by a much reduced margin. Savarin entered into a coalition arrangement with the Roosie Douglas-led Dominica Labour Party. He was appointed Minister for Tourism. After Douglas died some eight months later, Pierre Charles was appointed Prime Minister. He added the responsibilities of Enterprise Development and The Public Service to Savarin's portfolio.\n\nSavarin was one of the most vocal defenders of the Pierre Charles government, often acting for Charles when the later was overseas. He was also Chairman of the cabinet sub-committee on the economy. This placed him in the forefront of discussions and negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and other donor agencies. Savarin was also one of the main speakers at town hall style meetings of the government to inform the public on the serious difficulties facing the economy. In 2003 as acting Prime Minister Savarin announced the plans by a foreign company to build a billion dollar oil refinery in Castle Bruce Dominica. However attempts by the media to contact the company were unsuccessful and the plan did not proceed.\n\nFollowing the death of Pierre Charles on 6 January 2004, Savarin remained as Tourism Minister following the appointment of Roosevelt Skerrit as Prime Minister. The Freedom Party continued to decline and won no seats in the May 2005 General Elections. Savarin was however rewarded for his loyalty to the coalition and was named Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and Labour. In a 2008 Cabinet reshuffle Savarin was made Minister of Public Utilities, Ports and the Public Service.\n\nSavarin joined the Labour Party and was instrumental in the public campaign for the 2009 General Elections. He co-hosted a popular night time show alongside Attorney Anthony Astaphan and DLP stalwart Eddie Lambert. Savarin known for his platform oratory skills was also a key figure on the DLP political platform.\n\nHe served as General Secretary of the Civil Service Association (CSA) for nearly two decades and almost single-handedly organised public service employees into the most powerful trade union in Dominica. During the public service protest action over a 5% salary cut in 2003, Savarin was at the forefront in defending the government's action. This aggravated the PSU leadership, with General Secretary Thomas Letang threatening to revoke Savarin's lifetime membership in the Union.\n\nSavarin gained nationwide recognition for two CSA-led strikes: the 1973 public service strike over the transfer of radio personality Daniel \"Papa Dee\" Cauderion, and the September–October 1977 CSA general strike that virtually crippled the island. Savarin grew in stature and was the most notable trade union leader on the island. The CSA's orientation was middle class, not working class. Though its membership came from the formerly disenfranchised Dominican working class, which had gained socio-economic ascendancy through earlier Labour Party reform, most of the CSA leadership was now sympathetic to the Freedom Party. Indeed, the CSA and other local trade union now followed the pro business and neo-colonial philosophy of the US AFL-CIO which had pursued a fiercely anti-Leftwing policy in Latin America.\n\n\n"}

Its address is 9015 Sunset Boulevard.\n\nThe bottom level of the building is the restaurant, The Rainbow Bar and Grill. Upstairs is an exclusive club called \"Over the Rainbow\", which consists of a full bar, a dance floor, and a DJ booth. The restaurant is next to The Roxy Theatre and 1 OAK; formerly Gazzarri's, Billboard Live, and The Key Club.\n\nThe restaurant was founded in early 1972 by Elmer Valentine, Lou Adler, Mario Maglieri and others, opening on April 16, 1972, with a party for Elton John. At the time, the word \"rainbow\" signified peace and freedom. It quickly became known as a hangout for celebrities of all types. John Belushi ate his last meal (lentil soup) at table No. 16. For many years, the owner was Mario Maglieri.\n\nBefore becoming the Rainbow, the restaurant was the Villa Nova restaurant, which was originally owned by film director Vincente Minnelli, at the time married to Judy Garland. Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe met at the restaurant on a blind date in 1952.\n\nThe Rainbow became known as a hangout for rock musicians and their groupies. Notable regulars at the Rainbow in this period include Keith Moon, Alice Cooper, Micky Dolenz, Harry Nilsson, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and Neil Diamond. Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash were known to have occasionally visited the Rainbow. The group of musicians calling themselves the Hollywood Vampires made the Rainbow their home away from home in the mid-1970s. In the last two decades of his life, Motörhead frontman Lemmy was a daily fixture at the Rainbow whenever the band was not on tour, and often played a video poker machine at the end of the bar table.\n\nProducer Kim Fowley used to hang out at the Rainbow, especially in 1975, when he formed the all-girl group The Runaways. Actress and musician Cheryl Smith was given her pseudonym Rainbeaux Smith early in her career as a result of her frequenting the Rainbow; she briefly replaced Sandy West as drummer of The Runaways at the end of that band's existence.\n\nAs musical trends on the Strip changed towards heavy metal in the 1980s, the Rainbow followed suit. Members of Mötley Crüe, Poison, and Guns N' Roses frequented the bar. It was mentioned in a number of songs, such as \"Sunset and Babylon\" by W.A.S.P., \"Vampire\" by L.A. Guns and \"Peach Kelli Pop\" by Redd Kross, and featured in the videos of \"November Rain\", \"Estranged\" and \"Don't Cry\" by Guns N' Roses and also, although briefly, \"Rock Out\" by Motörhead.\n\nAnthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers noted in his book \"Scar Tissue\" that he often sat with his father, Blackie Dammett, at the club along with members of bands such as Led Zeppelin and Kiss. Often the waitresses and bartenders were groupies as well as those who frequented the establishment. In Pamela Des Barres' book \"Let's Spend the Night Together\", the author commented that as a barfly in the early 1980s she met a number of celebrities including Billy Idol.\n\nIn June 2016, the Rainbow started having live music every Wednesday night from 10pm until closing. Various musicians would host the live jam every week. Local acts, as well as different well known musicians would show up to perform random classic rock cover songs every week. During this time, there were many jam band gatherings being established on Sunset Boulevard around the area. Viper Room and The Whisky a Go Go also joined the Rainbow by allowing musicians to host jams on various week nights as well.\n\nOn January 18, 2017 the Rainbow was inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History for introducing the world to new Heavy Metal acts.\n\nLos Angeles songwriter Warren Zevon referenced the scene at the Rainbow in the last verse of his 1976 song \"Poor Poor Pitiful Me\".\n\nThe musical group Rainbow was named after this club.\n\nThe bar is featured in the Guns N' Roses videos for \"November Rain\" and in \"Estranged.\" \n\nThe Great White video for \"Angel song\" also features the bar. \n\nThe track \"Rainbow Bar & Grill\" from the Cheech & Chong album \"Let's Make a New Dope Deal\" takes place in the bar and restaurant.\n\nThe Rainbow is featured in the 2017 fantasy novel \"The Road To Roo Inn\" by Morat.\n\nFragrance company 19-69 released a perfume named after the Rainbow Bar in 2018.\n\nFeatured in the 2018 Netflix original film \"The Dirt\", the story behind Mötley Crüe.\n\nThe Jimmy Buffett song, \"You'll Never Work In This Bidness Again\" references the Rainbow in the line of the bridge, \"I parked cars at the Rainbow, I sold maps of the stars...\".\n\n\n"}

He was one of the thinkers who maintained that the nenbutsu ritual, which was said to induce a vision of Amida, was an important hermeneutic principle in the Buddhist doctrinal system. \n\nThe Buddhist master was one of the two leading disciple of Ryogen along with Kakuun. He studied both esoteric and esoteric teachings under this master, who was the 18th head of the Enryakuji Temple. \n\nGenshin was not a wandering evangelist as Kūya was, but was an elite cleric who espoused a doctrine of devotion to Amida Buddha which taught that because Japan was thought to have entered \"mappō\", the \"degenerate age\" of the \"latter law,\" the only hope for salvation lay in the reliance on the power of Amitabha. Other doctrines, he claimed, could not aid an individual because they depended on \"self-power\" (\"jiriki\"), which cannot prevail during the chaos of the degenerate age, when the power of another (\"tariki\") is necessary. In his approach to rebirth in the Pure Land, Genshin emphasized visual meditation practices, where later Pure Land sects favored verbal recitations such as the nembutsu. Genshin's doctrine is documented in his magnum opus, the , which in later copies of the text came complete with graphic depictions of the joy of the blessed and the suffering of those doomed to chaos.\n\nGenshin's influence in contemporary Japanese culture today is primarily due to his treatise, \"Ōjōyōshū\", particularly the graphic descriptions of the Buddhist hell realms (地獄 \"jigoku\"), which inspired a genre of horror and morality stories. The 1960 Japanese film \"Jigoku\" was influenced by Genshin's \"Ōjōyōshū\" among other works. In Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, he is considered the Sixth Patriarch.\n\nGenshin is credited as the founder of the \"Enshin\" school of Tendai Buddhism, and for espousing the \"original enlightenment\" teaching, or \"hongaku\" (本覚), where one is originally enlightened, but unaware of it. In all, Genshin left more than 30 works which continue to influence Pure Land thought today.\n\nThe image of Amida Nyorai in the main building of Yasaka-ji Temple in Shikoku is said to have been made by Genshin in the Heian Period.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1889233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889233", "title": "Non-constituency Member of Parliament", "text": "Non-constituency Member of Parliament\n\nA Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) is a member of a Singaporean opposition political party who, according to the Constitution and Parliamentary Elections Act, is declared to have been elected a Member of the Parliament of Singapore despite having lost in a general election by virtue of having been one of the best-performing losers. NCMPs enjoy most of the privileges of ordinary Members of Parliament.\n\nThe NCMP scheme was introduced in 1984, and was a significant modification of the traditional Westminster system of government. Since the ruling People's Action Party had won all parliamentary seats in the four general elections since independence, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew argued that the NCMP scheme would ensure that opposition voices would be heard in Parliament. According to him, this would be beneficial to Singapore as it would give the younger generation of Singaporeans a chance to see what an opposition can or cannot do. When the first constitutional amendment was made to initiate the NCMP scheme, between three and six NCMPs were allowed in Parliament. The Constitution was amended again in 2010 to allow for a maximum of nine NCMPs in Parliament.\n\nSince its inception, the scheme has been widely criticised. It has been considered undemocratic as it allows candidates who do not have the mandate of the people to air their views in Parliament. Furthermore, members of the opposition have criticized the scheme for creating an unequal playing field in a general election by enabling the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) to argue that the electorate need not vote for opposition candidates as there will already be some opposition representation in Parliament. Despite this critique, several opposition politicians have accepted NCMP seats, including Lee Siew-Choh, J. B. Jeyaretnam, Steve Chia and Sylvia Lim. NCMPs have raised notable points in Parliament with regards to various public policy issues such as criminal procedure, education, health and social welfare.\n\nThe 2011 general election brought three NCMPs into Parliament: Lina Loh (the wife of Chiam See Tong, the former MP for Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency) of the Singapore People's Party, and Gerald Giam and Yee Jenn Jong of the Workers' Party of Singapore. The general election of 2015 brought in three different NCMPs into Parliament: Dennis Tan, Leon Perera and Daniel Goh. A NCMP seat was offered to former MP for Punggol East, Lee Li Lian but she declined and the seat was eventually accepted by Associate Professor Daniel Goh.\n\nA Non-constituency Member of Parliament (\"NCMP\") is a candidate of an opposition political party who, despite having lost in a general election, is declared elected as a Member of the Parliament of Singapore (\"MP\") by virtue of provisions in the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act enabling the unsuccessful candidates who have performed the best to be accorded the status. The MP is so called because he or she does not represent any constituency (or electoral division) in Parliament.\n\nThe NCMP scheme was introduced on 22 August 1984 by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1984 and the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 1984. Under Article 39(1)(b) of the Constitution which was introduced by the constitutional amendment Act, the maximum number of NCMPs was set at six. However, the actual number that could be declared elected at any general election was fixed at three, less the total number of Opposition MPs elected to Parliament. The President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, could order that between four and six NCMPs be declared elected for the purpose of a particular general election. Such an order ceased to have effect at the next dissolution of Parliament. On 1 July 2010, the need for a presidential order to increase the number of NCMPs was removed. Instead, the maximum number of NCMPs in Parliament was increased from six to nine, and the actual number that would be declared elected following a general election would be nine less the number of opposition MPs elected to Parliament.\n\nNCMPs have been called the \"best losers\" of each general election. As NCMPs are declared elected from candidates who fail to win at general elections, they are subject to the same qualifying criteria as elected MPs:\n\n\nThe Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act provide for a minimum of nine opposition representatives in Parliament. After the polling results for a general election have been released, the opposition candidates receiving the highest percentage of votes in their electoral divisions but not elected into Parliament will be offered NCMP seats. However, this is subject to several conditions. There must be less than nine opposition members voted into Parliament, and the candidate must have garnered at least 15% of the total number of votes polled at the election in the electoral division he or she contested in. In addition, there can be no more than two NCMPs from one Group Representation Constituency (\"GRC\") and no more than one NCMP from an electoral division that is not a GRC.\n\nIf the number of opposition candidates elected is less than nine, losing opposition candidates who have the highest percentage of votes during the election will be declared elected as NCMPs to make up the minimum number of opposition MPs. Hence, the number of NCMP seats offered is nine minus the number of elected opposition MPs.\n\nIn the event that a group of candidates contesting in a GRC is offered an NCMP seat, the group must decide within seven days the person or persons to be declared elected as NCMPs and notify the returning officer. Once an NCMP has been declared elected, he or she must take an oath of allegiance to Singapore and to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore\". If this is not done at the first or second sitting of Parliament during its first session after the general election, Parliament may by resolution declare that the NCMP's seat has become vacant and that it will be filled by the next succeeding eligible candidate at the general elections, the candidates having priority based on the percentage of votes polled by them.\n\nOpposition members who qualify to become NCMPs are allowed to reject their seats in Parliament. During the 2011 general election, several opposition leaders stated that they would not want to accept NCMP seats. Among them was Low Thia Kiang, the Secretary-General of the Workers' Party of Singapore (\"WP\").\n\nLike MPs, NCMPs are allowed to engage in debate in Parliament and give their points of view. Since 1 April 2017, they will enjoy the same voting rights as MPs. Before that, they are allowed to vote on all issues with the exception of the following:\n\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced on 27 January 2016 that NCMPs would get equal voting rights as MPs and the exceptions will be removed. The minimum number of opposition MPs will also be increased from nine to twelve from the next election. This was passed by parliament on 9 November 2016, in the same constitutional amendment as that which introduced the hiatus-triggered reserved presidential election.\n\nDuring the Second Reading of the NCMP bill, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew presented to Parliament three main justifications for the NCMP scheme. First, he said that having a minimum number of opposition members in Parliament through the NCMP scheme would provide younger People's Action Party (\"PAP\") MPs with sparring partners to \"sharpen their debating skills\". Secondly, the presence of opposition members in Parliament would educate the younger generation of voters about the role of a constitutional opposition and the limits of what it can do. He said this was especially important because the younger generation who had not lived and witnessed the conflicts within Parliament in the 1950s and 1960s \"harbour[ed] myths about the role of an Opposition\" and \"had no idea how destructive an Opposition could be\". Thirdly, the presence of non-PAP MPs in Parliament would act as a check and balance against any governmental impropriety. According to Lee, \"some non-PAP MPs will ensure that every suspicion, every rumour of misconduct, will be reported to the non-PAP MPs\". The readiness of non-PAP members to bring forth any allegation of misfeasance, or corruption, or nepotism would \"dispel suspicions of cover-ups of alleged wrongdoings\".\n\nMore importantly, the NCMP scheme was introduced to \"ensure the representation in Parliament of a minimum number of Members from a political party or parties not forming the Government\". The PAP possessed \"unbroken hegemony\" in Parliament from 1968 until 1981 when J. B. Jeyaretnam won a seat in the Anson by-election. As a result of his sole opposition presence in the Parliament, he could not initiate a meaningful debate in Parliament, being unable to find another MP to second his motions. The fact that there was absolutely no opposition representation in Parliament in the four general elections before 1984 (as indicated in the table below) added to the impetus for the inception of the scheme.\n\nThe NCMP scheme has been the subject of criticism, both within the PAP and among opposition MPs and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs). During parliamentary debates in April 2010 on increasing the number of NCMPs from six to nine, several MPs expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of legitimacy and anti-democratic nature of the NCMP concept. For instance, PAP MP Alvin Yeo expressed doubts as to whether the NCMP scheme had served to raise the level of debate in Parliament, while NMP Calvin Cheng said:\n\nThe opposition has, from the introduction of the NCMP scheme, decried it as a \"sham\" and a \"toothless\" office. Opposition member J. B. Jeyaratnam questioned whether it was \"a trick or a ploy\" by the ruling party to maintain its dominance in Parliament. It has been argued that the system has placed the opposition at a disadvantage at general elections for a number of reasons. For one, there are restrictions on NCMPs as to what they can or cannot vote on in Parliament. Thus, it has been suggested that the presence of NCMPs in Parliament \"does not seem to extend beyond the decorative and the provision of debating foils for the younger PAP generation unexposed to the gladiatorial quality of parliamentary debate\". Moreover, the effectiveness of the NCMP scheme is limited by the perception that the NCMP is obliged to be adversarial by virtue of being party to the opposition. This is so even if privately the Member can apprehend the benefits of a Government proposal. Finally, the NCMP scheme has been criticized as a ploy to discourage voters from voting in opposition MPs because of the guarantee of at least a number of NCMP seats. This inhibits the natural growth of an elected opposition voice in Parliament as the electorate's motivation to vote in an opposition Member into Parliament is conceivably diluted by the assurance that a default mechanism exists for the \"best losers\".\n\nOpposition MP Low Thia Khiang has cited an NCMP's lack of \"muscle and real grassroot[s] grounding\" as a reason for his refusal to take up an NCMP seat. NCMPs do not represent any constituency and are thus denied of opportunities to expand their influence.\n\nDuring the 2010 debates, Sylvia Lim, then the sole NCMP in Parliament, commented that having NCMPs \"make[s] a bad situation better, but increasing NCMPs is not the solution towards a more robust political system\". She identified an NCMP's lack of any official capacity to represent the people or write letters on their behalf as a drawback of the scheme. Moreover, an NCMP has no physical base to organize activities or dialogues with the people. In her view, it would be better for politics in Singapore if the NCMP scheme was regarded merely as a \"stop-gap measure\" to deal with the lack of alternative voices in Parliament as a result of the ruling party's alleged abuse of the GRC system and gerrymandering.\n\nIn 2011 during a live television forum, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong refuted claims that NCMPs were not a \"real opposition\" by stating that the PAP had introduced and expanded the scheme \"because it acknowledged both the desire among Singaporeans for alternative voices and the need for an opposition to represent the diverse views in society\". He noted that NCMPs were free to debate issues in Parliament, and that the scheme provided opposition politicians with an opportunity to \"establish themselves and strengthen their positions in subsequent general elections\".\n\nIn the 1984 general election, the first held after the NCMP scheme was introduced, as the opposition MPs J. B. Jeyaretnam of the WP and Chiam See Tong of the Singapore Democratic Party were elected to Parliament, the single NCMP seat available was allocated to the WP's M. D. P. Nair. However, the WP decided that its defeated candidates should not take up NCMP seats. Jeyaretnam, the WP's Secretary-General, said that the \"real object\" behind the scheme was to persuade the electorate to return the PAP to all the seats in Parliament, which was \"the antithesis of what Parliament is\". The NCMP seat was then allocated to Tan Chee Kien of the Singapore United Front, but his party also decided to reject the seat. This was regarded as a \"resignation\", and the NCMP seat was thus not filled.\n\nThe first NCMP to take up a seat in Parliament, Dr. Lee Siew-Choh of the WP, did so following the 1988 general election at which Chiam See Tong was the only opposition MP elected. The WP's Lee and Francis Seow were declared elected as NCMPs on 16 December 1988. However, on 9 January 1989 the Speaker of Parliament Tan Soo Khoon announced that Seow had lost his seat with effect from 17 December 1988 under Article 45 of the Constitution after he was convicted and fined for tax evasion. In the general election that followed in 1991, a special provision was made for four instead of three NCMP seats, but none were offered because four opposition members were successful in their respective electoral divisions.\n\nIn the 1997 general election, it was back to the default three NCMP seats. After two opposition members were elected, one NCMP seat was offered to, and accepted by, J. B. Jeyaratnam. He was declared elected with effect from 14 January 1997. Subsequently, with effect from 23 July 2001, Jeyaretnam fell into bankruptcy due to an unpaid debt and thus lost his seat in Parliament. The general election that year saw one NCMP seat occupied by Steve Chia of the Singapore Democratic Alliance.\n\nIn the 2006 general election, Sylvia Lim, Chairman of the Workers' Party, garnered 43.9% of the votes in Aljunied GRC, making her the \"best loser\" of the election. She was subsequently declared elected as the next NCMP in Parliament on 12 May 2006.\n\nFollowing the increase in the number of NCMP seats in Parliament to nine in 2010, since the Workers' Party garnered six seats at the 2011 general election, three NCMP seats were offered. They were taken up by Lina Loh from the Singapore People's Party who contested in Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency (SMC), and Yee Jenn Jong and Gerald Giam of the Workers' Party who contested in Joo Chiat SMC and East Coast GRC respectively.\n\nNCMPs have raised and debated in Parliament a wide range of issues. What follows are some of the more notable issues mentioned.\n\nIn November 2002, NCMP Steve Chia supported a motion by the Minister for Education stating that \"this House ... (1) supports the new JC [junior college] curriculum which will better develop thinking, communication and other process skills and engage students in greater breadth of learning; and (2) endorses greater diversity and opening of new pathways in JC/Upper Secondary education to cater to the different strengths and interests of students.\" He suggested that there should be a focus on \"creative spontaneity\", expressing the view that the education system in 2002 was one that focused on churning out a production line of workers, managers and instruction takers. Given that Singapore had reached the standards of a First World economy, Singapore should focus on instilling an inquisitive spirit within students, to encourage students to ask questions. He placed most emphasis on the importance of ensuring that the focus of education should be character building, stating: \"It will be failure of our education system if we are to train our best and brightest with our best resources only to be told that they are going to be the quitters of our society; or that they lack the compassion for the weak and the down; or that they behave in a snobbish class of their own; or behave condescendingly to their peers and followers; or that the elites only care about their own self-interests.\"\n\nIn 2003, Chia mooted the idea that Singaporeans should be able to borrow from their own Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings to tide over periods of financial difficulty. His rationale was that if individuals could borrow from their own CPF accounts to buy depreciating property and money-losing stocks, there was no reason why they should not be allowed to do so to pay for bills. Dr. Ong Seh Hong, MP for Aljunied GRC, opposed the view, stating that it was important and for the good of Singapore that Singaporeans were independent individuals who could assume the risks and successes of their investments and be self-sufficient.\n\nWith the advent of the Integrated Resorts, which are casino-based vacation resorts, in 2005 Chia expressed concern in Parliament over whether the Government had systems and institutions in place to lessen their negative impact such as problem gambling and the spectre of people gambling away family assets.\n\nSylvia Lim was an NCMP from 2006 till Parliament was dissolved in 2011 for the general election held that year, at which she was elected as one of the MPs for Aljunied GRC. While she was an NCMP, Parliament debated the Human Organ Transplant (Amendment) Bill 2009 which would permit an organ donor to receive a reasonable amount of payment as a reimbursement for medical checks, insurance and other medical expenses, and loss of income. Lim spoke of her worry that the bill might lead to a backdoor organ trading and profiteering.\n\nIn 2010, Lim mooted the idea that the proportion of each Primary 1 cohort that would be seeking a university education should be increased beyond the 30% by 2015 that the Government was planning. She noted that in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2006 about 37% of each age cohort received a degree-level education, and that a sizeable number of Singaporean students who failed to gain entry into local universities had done well in reputable universities overseas. She also suggested giving concessionary fares to disabled individuals who make up 2% of the adult population under 60 years.\n\nLim expressed concerns about a proposed constitutional amendment introduced in April 2010 that would allow magistrates to hear what are called \"first mentions\" through video conferencing. A first mention is a hearing that must be held within 48 hours of a person's arrest. She felt it failed to adequately assure accused people that they were allowed to complain to magistrates about injuries they had sustained or acts of misfeasance against them by the authorities. In response, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng assured MPs that processes would be in place to ensure that accused people are treated fairly. For example, during a video conference, an accused person will be alone in a room with no police officer, and will be able to see what is happening in the entire courtroom. Secondly, the screen that will be used by the judge is large enough to enable him or her to clearly see whether the accused is under duress. Finally, accused people who have been mistreated can either complain to the police or to the judge when they are later present in court.\n\nThe following month, during parliamentary debates on major revisions to the Criminal Procedure Code, Lim suggested there was a need to improve pre-trial disclosure procedures and to ensure that victims of crimes received redress. Further, she expressed concerns over the leniency of community-based sentencing. The bill eventually incorporated several of her suggestions.\n\nIn 2011, Lim noted that the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all children have the opportunity to receive an education. However, she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for children with special needs were cumbersome. Furthermore, education for children with special needs was not subject to the same subsidies that students in mainstream schools had. She thus brought to the House's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "1889251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889251", "title": "Annie and Clarabel", "text": "Annie and Clarabel\n\nAnnie and Clarabel are 2 anthropomorphic passenger coaches from \"The Railway Series\" children's books by the Rev. W. Awdry and its television adaptation, \"Thomas (the Tank Engine) & Friends\". In the stories, they are Thomas the Tank Engine's passenger coaches.\n\nAnnie and Clarabel both have seating accommodation for carrying passengers; Clarabel also has a brake compartment for luggage and a guard. They have been described by the Rev. Awdry as being old and in need of new paint; however, Thomas loves them dearly and would never dream of being separated from them. The two coaches are nearly always seen coupled together, with Annie usually facing Thomas and Clarabel facing backwards. They are the first official female characters to appear in the series.\n\nIn \"The Adventure Begins\", when Thomas met Annie and Clarabel for the first time (before he got his branch line) he thought they were the express coaches. He apologised and introduced himself, leaving them both impressed. They were often pulled by James.\n\nNot only do they carry passengers for Thomas, but they also act as advisors and confidantes. On several occasions they have warned him about potential hazards, and Thomas invariably runs into trouble when he ignores their warnings. Annie and Clarabel are occasionally pulled by other engines when Thomas is busy (usually by Percy, Toby, Duck, Caitlin, Stanley, and Emily), but Thomas always worries for their safety and can sometimes be jealous.\n\nThe coaches first appeared in the 1946 book \"Thomas the Tank Engine\", in which they were awarded to Thomas along with his branch line. In this first, brief appearance, they were not named. In \"Tank Engine Thomas Again\" (1949), they were given names and their characters were greatly expanded upon.\n\nIn \"The Railway Series\", they are depicted as bogie coaches (i.e. each coach is supported on a pair of four-wheeled bogies or \"trucks\"). In the television series they are depicted as four-wheeled coaches – they are built on a rigid chassis, with fixed axles. In both series they appear in a plain orangey-brown colour, and in the television series they also have their names painted on their body sides. The color scheme is based on that of the former British LNER railway, which formed the basis for a number of Awdry's early characters; that railway's carriages were not painted in the normal manner of other railways, but had a teak-wood finish on the outside, which was plain varnished over, the resulting livery being known as \"varnished teak\". When steel carriages were introduced later, a paint scheme was devised by the LNER which closely resembled this colour scheme.\n\nThey first appeared in the first season of the television program Thomas (the Tank Engine) & Friends and have been in every season since. They had no speaking role from Season 10 until \"Season 12\". And since then, they again have speaking roles.\n\nIn a sense, Annie is the oldest character in the Railway Series. Wilbert Awdry was a model railway enthusiast long before he wrote the stories. In 1927, while still at school, he built a model coach. In 1948 he constructed models of Thomas and his coaches to run at a local village fair, and so used that 1927 coach as Annie. He built a new coach to represent Clarabel.\n\nUnlike most characters in \"The Railway Series\", Annie and Clarabel do not appear to be based upon any specific prototype. However, they are fairly typical of suburban coaches, such as might have been used for branch and secondary services. Christopher Awdry has suggested in a character profile that they may have been rebuilt from older, six-wheeled coaches by The Fat Controller. Unlike most of the engines, the history of Annie and Clarabel before their first appearance in the books has been kept very vague. Most merchandise of the coaches show Annie with a shocked expression on her face, while Clarabel is usually depicted smiling.\n\nThe characters designs on television bear a strong resemblance to coaches of the Metropolitan Railway, part of which is now part of the London Underground. Annie and Clarabel, along with Old Slow Coach, are the only coaches to have facial features, except for the Narrow Gauge Coaches in Season 4. Annie and Clarabel are also very similar to the old coaches in Season 1.\n\n\n"}

SexArt participated in both the 1993 Kern County, and Fresno County \"Battle Of The Bands\" contests, and won them both.<br>\nJonathan Davis left the band in early 1993. Following Davis's departure, Richard Morrill auditioned and became the new singer for SexArt.\nRichard Morrill previously sang for Bakersfield music group L.A.P.D.. (whom later became the band Korn, having Jonathan Davis as their new singer). The SexArt (band), along with Richard Morrill, relocated from Bakersfield, to Los Angeles, Ca. Where they changed the group name to SuperModel.\n\nFormed late 1993, SuperModel (previously named SexArt) joined with ex-singer L.A.P.D. member, Richard Morrill, and moved from Bakersfield Ca. to Los Angeles, Ca. After a year, on the later side of 1994, the band relocated to Huntington Beach Ca.. The band maintained a steady live performance all around Southern Ca. until they broke up in early 1996. SuperModel had seven songs. None of which were released, nor professionally recorded.\n\n\nAfter leaving SexArt, Jonathan Davis continued to build his music career while singing for the music group Korn. Today, as he remains the singer for Korn, Davis has managed to reach the highest levels of success. Following Metallica's footsteps, Korn has become one of the biggest metal groups of all time, as they have cleared more than 40 million sales worldwide. Davis and his band Korn are currently in line to be a future inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and remain active.\n\nIn 1996 the band \"SuperModel\" had dissolved. From that point Dennis Shinn had met up with Jay Gordon, and Jay Baumgardner to secure them on behalf RoadRunner Records, becoming the production team to produce the debut LP for the band Coal Chamber. From there, Dennis Shinn teamed up with Jay Gordon to start a new band. Dennis Shinn - (drums), Ryan Shuck - (guitar), and Jay Gordon - (bass and vocals), becoming the early stages of the music group Orgy. Later, Dennis Shinn departed from the group to focus on music production. Ryan Shuck remained in the band, and Orgy, were signed onto the Elementree label shortly after Shinn's departure. In 1998, Orgy released their debut album \"Candyass\", RIAA Certified Platinum, selling almost two million copies worldwide.\n\nRyan Shuck later departed from Orgy, to start Julien-K. Shuck also made one album with Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington, titled Dead By Sunrise. Julien-K remain active. In 2019, Ryan Shuck became the singer for Adema.\n\nAs \"SuperModel\" [band] dissolved in 1996, David DeRoo and Ray Solis returned to Bakersfield and created a new band, titled \"Juice\". Juice recorded a few demos and played shows extensively for a couple of years. The band dissolved in 1999 due to creative differences.\n\nFollowing the break-up of Juice, David DeRoo along with bandmate Tim Fluckey joined Mark Chavez (Jonathan Davis' half brother) to form Adema. The band garnished a stellar recording contract with Arista Records in 2001. Adema released their self-titled debut LP, peaking at number 27 on the \"Billboard\" Top 200. <br>\nAdema became RIAA certified Gold in the US and sold over 1 million copies worldwide. <br>\nAdema remain active.\n\nIn 1997, following drum duties and his early departure from Orgy, Dennis Shinn carried out his passion for artist development, and producing music. Over the years Shinn has helped develop numerous new music groups, rap artists, and singers, securing them with record labels. From 1999 thru 2010 Shinn also fronted a post-punk music group as the lead singer. Dennis Shinn remains a music producer under the name \"AKA MENACE\", and has signed 7 new artist's whom he is also producing. Among them is the hiphop singer Matt Craven\n\nDuring the years 1992–1993, the band SexArt had been gaining momentum, local buzz, crowd attendance, as well as local radio support. Around this time is also when the band members of Korn went to watch a show by SexArt, where they spotted Jonathan Davis singing. Davis was approached by the band members of Korn to depart from SexArt and join in a band with them. This was before their very last live performance. SexArt's last show they performed with Jonathan as their singer was \"Bakersfield's Battle of the Bands\". A few weeks later, the band all came together to do one last recording of three songs. Immediately following the last SexArt studio session, the band re-joined without Davis, in search of new singer.\n\nSexArt were never signed to a record label, although creating around fifteen songs. Six of the songs were recorded at the Rick Davis recording studio called \"Fat Tracks\". The others were recorded on boom box, and/or 4-track recorders. The only released song by SexArt was entitled \"Inside\", which featured Ty Elam from Videodrone taking on the vocal duties, as Jonathan Davis appears at the ending of the song. The song was released on the \"Cultivation '92\" compilation CD, from the label \"A Kick Produkt\". The band had 15 songs all together and had only semi-professionally recorded six songs over the course of three recording sessions from 1992, thru 1993. The recordings were produced inside the Rick Davis recording studio \"Fat Tracks\" - Bakersfield Ca. The songs chosen to be recorded; 1: Blind, 2: Follow Me, aka: Daddy, 3: I Wanna Know Why, 4: Give Up, 5: Waste My Time, and 6: Inside.\n\nThe songs \"Follow Me - (now titled Daddy), and Blind\", represented by Korn, were originally written by Dennis Shinn. Both songs had been re-produced, and featured on Korn's 1993 demo tape Neidermayer's Mind, as well as their debut album LP self-titled 1994 debut.\n\nAlthough not heavily publicized, it's very well known that Dennis Shinn had written the song Blind entirely, the music composition, lyrics, and melodies. And as a co-writer [lyrics, and melodies] on such songs as \"Alive, Daddy, and Predictable\". These are the 4 songs that made up Korn's 1993 demo tape \"Neidermayer's Mind\" which placed Korn into their record label recording contract. Korn's debut LP 1994 featured 3 of the 4 songs that Shinn helped create. The song \"Alive\" came a decade later landing on Korn's \"Take A Look In The Mirror\" album LP. As explained by Dennis Shinn, it was the band Korn and Jonathan Davis who had failed to credit the writers. Or in other words \"stole or lifted\" the material that Shinn had created. Because of this, Shinn was forced to hire legal counsel and was then able to fetch a small portion of his rightful credits once Korn surrendered from the lawsuit. \"Blind and Daddy\" are the two (2) songs Korn settled the civil suit with by giving Dennis Shinn credits. Ryan Shuck was also granted a portion of credit, even though the debut Korn LP hadn't featured any of his work. During SexArt, Shuck had added one musical piece to the pre-existing song by Shinn \"Blind\". The same music piece also appeared on Korn's 1993 demo tape. However, Shuck's minor contribution was removed once Korn had re-recorded \"Blind\" for their debut album LP in 1994.\n\nSexArt's \"BLIND\" went on to become Korn's most iconic song. Not only was it the song that secured Korn major label recording contracts, and becoming the very 1st single and music video to ever be released by Korn. The song appears on many products, films, video games, live concert and music festival DVDs.<br>\nCollectively selling more than 12 Million units WorldWide. Debut Korn LP selling 10 Million World Wide, 4 Million in the U.S. RIAA Certified 2X Platinum. <br>\nOnline Presence: \"Blind\" has cleared 90 MILLION Video views, and 120 MILLION Audio streams.

At present he works as a business consultant.\n\nGloystein was born in 1945 in Bremen, Germany. After leaving school he studied Business Management at the University of Hamburg achieving his PhD in 1977 with a thesis titled \"The promotion of industrial restructuring by funding instruments of the European Community\", which was later published as a book entitled \"Financing of industrial restructuring through the EC\".\n\nFrom 1971 to 1975 he worked as Scientific Lecturer at the HWWA-Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung in Hamburg. Following this he moved on to investment banking at the WestLB in Düsseldorf (1975-1981). Gloystein then went on to work at the Commerzbank AG where he remained until 1999. First he was in charge of finance planning in the central department for Coordination and Planning in Frankfurt. In 1986 he moved on to be Head of the Stuttgart Branch. In 1990 he became Deputy Member of the Board and one year later Member of the Board of the Commerzbank AG. In 1999 Gloystein moved on to become Member of the Board of the BHF-Bank and at the same time Member of the Executive Committee Europe of the ING Group, Amsterdam. He became Speaker of the Board (CEO) of the BHF-Bank in 2000 in charge of Controlling, Credit-Risk Management, Law, Auditing and Corporate Communication. Gloystein resigned from the BHF and ING in 2002 as a result of differing opinions on future business strategy in the German market.\n\nAt the end of the 90s Gloystein was Member of the Board of the European Banking Association and the German Member of the Maas-Commission, which was formed by the European Commission for the technical preparation of the European Monetary Union.\n\nIn August 2004 the CDU nominated him as successor to Harmut Perschau, who had to resign due to health problems, and on 8 September 2004 he was voted in as the Lord Mayor and Senator for Economics and Harbours, as well as Senator for Culture in Bremen.\n\nGloystein is married with two children.\n\nIn Bremen Wine Week, on 12 May 2005, he poured a magnum of sparkling wine over Udo Oelschlaeger, a homeless man who was standing near the podium from which Mr Gloystein was speaking. Gloystein was described as laughing in the face of the crowd's boos and hisses. Mr Oelschlaeger himself did not respond with violence and simply burst into tears, asking \"Who are you? Why are you doing this?\" Mr Gloystein was taken away by bodyguards, after attempting to offer Mr Oelschlager first his business card, followed successively by money from his pocket, his £150 Montblanc pen, a night in a luxury hotel and lastly a two-week holiday, as well as costs for washing his clothes. Mr Oelschlaeger declined these offers, responding \"I don't need your money. I'm not going to be bribed. You offended me and wanted to make me look like an idiot.\" Mr Gloystein said that the incident had been intended as a \"joke\", and that he had, in fact, intended to pour the wine into Oelschlaeger's mouth, but that he had turned away. Onlookers described this as not corresponding with what they saw.\n\nMr Gloystein apparently later met Mr Oelschlaeger again and they parted \"on friendly terms\". Police confirmed that Oelschlaeger was pressing charges against Gloystein for the incident. Mr Gloystein later resigned over the incident, following pressure from the media and opposition parties.\n\nGloystein has returned to business. He is a business consultant with focus on finance and cultural management, until 2008 in Bremen and since then in Düsseldorf. The consultancy business (M & A) was initially based on the function as Advisory Director of the Investment Bank Lincoln International, Frankfurt/Chicago, and from 2012 as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Deutsche Mergers & Acquitions AG, Düsseldorf.

This war nearly leads to the extermination of the human race, but it is mysteriously halted at the last moment by the Minbari leadership for reasons that remain secret for over a decade. This near-destruction of the human race leads to the Earth Alliance commissioning the Babylon space stations as a means of preventing further wars.\n\nIn 2278, Centauri Prime is in flames.

He tells them the story of the Earth–Minbari War that took place 35 years prior while he was ambassador to Earth.\n\nThe human race, feeling cocky following their defeat of the Dilgar, is rapidly expanding into space. Word reaches them of the mysterious Minbari race. Though they are warned by Londo to leave this race alone, they seek to research the species first-hand.\n\nThe Minbari Grey Council, led by Dukhat, have become concerned that the Shadows may have returned to Z'ha'dum in fulfillment of Valen's prophecy. They are taking a roundabout route to investigate when they encounter Earth ships, led by EAS \"Prometheus\", seeking to investigate the Minbari.\n\nThe Minbari ships turn toward \"Prometheus\" and engage their long-range sensors to gain more data on the unknown Earth ship. Unknown to the Minbari, the intense EMP field generated by their sensors disables \"Prometheus\" jump engine, preventing the Earth ship from retreating. As the Minbari ships draw closer, they open their gun ports – a sign of respect in their culture. The interference from the Minbari sensors also prevents \"Prometheus\" from determining whether or not the Minbari ships are charging their weapons. The captain of \"Prometheus\", with his jump engines disabled and the Minbari ships approaching with the apparent intent to attack, opens fire. The Minbari ships are heavily damaged, and Dukhat is killed. In retaliation, the Grey Council declares a holy war against humanity, and the Earth–Minbari War begins.\n\nThe war lasts three years and countless humans are killed, their forces overwhelmed by superior Minbari technology. Lieutenant Commander John Sheridan, first officer of EAS \"Lexington\", is part of a battlegroup engaging the Minbari. After a Minbari ambush, Sheridan's commanding officer is killed. He assumes command of the damaged ship and lays a trap for the enemy, seeding the local asteroids with nuclear mines. The Minbari flagship \"Black Star\" closes in to finish off the ship, but is itself destroyed by the mines. This is Earth's only real victory during the war, and the Minbari faction that feels the war has caused enough senseless bloodshed uses this as an opportunity to engage in peace talks with Earth. However, the Centauri intelligence division discovers that the humans are having a secret meeting on a neutral planet that is being brokered by the Narn. Fearing the meeting is intended to secure a shipment of advanced arms, the Centauri bomb the peace conference, with neither the humans nor Minbari suspecting their intervention. All hope for peace is lost, and humanity's losses at the hands of the Minbari continue.\n\nIn a last, desperate effort, the President of Earth orders all available ships to form a \"line\" around the planet in an attempt to delay the Minbari to give some humans time to flee in transports. During the battle, Satai Delenn, a member of the Grey Council, captures a human pilot, Jeffrey Sinclair, ostensibly to learn about Earth's defenses. The Grey Council is startled to discover that he possesses the soul of the revered Minbari religious leader Valen. After examining several other humans, the Grey Council concludes that Minbari souls have been reincarnated in whole or in part in humans.\n\nSince Minbari do not kill Minbari, they surrender to the defenseless Earth forces. Because of the damage this revelation could do to their own culture, they keep the reason for the surrender a secret.\n\nIn the wake of the war, Earth builds a space station that can serve as a kind of \"United Nations in space\", with the intent of preventing future wars. This is the Babylon Station, destroyed by terrorists during construction. Various fates befall later iterations of the station, until the completion of Babylon 5.\n\nAfter the children leave him, Londo views Delenn and Sheridan being held captive in the Centauri palace, as previously seen in \"War Without End\". Toasting them as his friends, Londo drinks massively to put his Keeper to sleep so that he can let them escape.\nIn the first-season episode \"And the Sky Full of Stars\", a member of the Minbari Grey Council tells Delenn that Sinclair must be killed if he remembers his missing 24 hours at the Battle of the Line. J. Michael Straczynski has stated that this is not a contradiction, as unlike Kosh and Ulkesh (AKA Kosh II), the Grey Council did not know of Sinclair's destiny to travel back in time and become Valen, rather believing that it was the other way around. They had concluded that rather than see Minbari society destroyed, as they were not prepared for the truth about Valen at the time, it would be necessary to kill Sinclair if he remembered.\n\n"}
{"id": "1889289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889289", "title": "Character displacement", "text": "Character displacement\n\nCharacter displacement is the phenomenon where differences among similar species whose distributions overlap geographically are accentuated in regions where the species co-occur, but are minimized or lost where the species' distributions do not overlap. This pattern results from evolutionary change driven by biological competition among species for a limited resource (e.g. food). The rationale for character displacement stems from the competitive exclusion principle, also called Gause's Law, which contends that to coexist in a stable environment two competing species must differ in their respective ecological niche; without differentiation, one species will eliminate or exclude the other through competition.\n\nCharacter displacement was first explicitly explained by William L. Brown Jr. and E. O. Wilson in 1956: \"Two closely related species have overlapping ranges. In the parts of the ranges where one species occurs alone, the populations of that species are similar to the other species and may even be very difficult to distinguish from it. In the area of overlap, where the two species occur together, the populations are more divergent and easily distinguished, i.e., they 'displace' one another in one or more characters. The characters involved can be morphological, ecological, behavioral, or physiological; they are assumed to be genetically based.\"\n\nBrown and Wilson used the term character displacement to refer to instances of both reproductive character displacement, or reinforcement of reproductive barriers, and ecological character displacement driven by competition. As the term character displacement is commonly used, it generally refers to morphological differences due to competition. Brown and Wilson viewed character displacement as a phenomenon involved in speciation, stating, \"we believe that it is a common aspect of geographical speciation, arising most often as a product of the genetic and ecological interaction of two (or more) newly evolved, cognate species [derived from the same immediate parental species] during their period of first contact.\" While character displacement is important in various scenarios of speciation, including adaptive radiations like the cichlid fish faunas in the rift lakes of East Africa, it also plays an important role in structuring communities. It also plays a role in speciation by reinforcement in such that allopatric populations overlapping in sympatry exhibit greater trait divergence. The results of numerous studies contribute evidence that character displacement often influences the evolution of resource acquisition among members of an ecological guild.\n\nCompetitive release, defined as the expansion of an ecological niche in the absence of a competitor, is essentially the mirror image of character displacement. It too was described by Brown and Wilson: \"Two closely related species are distinct where they occur together, but where one member of the pair occurs alone it converges toward the second, even to the extent of being nearly identical with it in some characters.\"\n\n\"Character displacement is the situation in which, when two species of animals overlap geographically, the differences between them are accentuated in the zone of sympatry and weakened or lost entirely in the parts of their ranges outside this zone\". While the term \"ecological character displacement\" first appeared in the scientific literature in 1956, the idea has earlier roots. For example, Joseph Grinnell, in the classic paper that set forth the concept of the ecological niche, stated, \"It is, of course, axiomatic that no two species regularly established in a single fauna have precisely the same niche requirements.\" The existence of character displacement is evidence that the two species do not completely overlap in their niche requirement.\n\nFollowing the dissemination of the concept, character displacement was viewed as an important force in structuring ecological communities, and biologists identified numerous examples. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the role of competition and character displacement in structuring communities was questioned and its importance greatly downgraded. Many found the early examples unconvincing and suggested it to be a rare phenomenon. Criticisms with earlier studies included the lack of rigor in statistical analyses and the use of poorly rationalized characters. Additionally, theory seemed to indicate that the conditions that allowed character displacement to occur were limited. This scrutiny helped motivate theoretical and methodological advances as well as the development of a more rigorous framework for testing character displacement.\n\nSix criteria have been developed to establish character displacement as the mechanism for differences between sympatric species. These include: (1) differences between sympatric taxa are greater than expected by chance; (2) differences in character states are related to differences in resource use; (3) resources are limiting, and interspecific competition for these resources is a function of character similarity; (4) resource distribution are the same in sympatry and allopatry such that differences in character states are not due to differences in resource availability; (5) differences must have evolved in situ; (6) differences must be genetically based. Rigorously testing these criteria necessitates a synthetic approach, combining areas of research like community ecology, functional morphology, adaptation, quantitative genetics and phylogenetic systematics, While satisfying all six criteria in a single study of character displacement is not often feasible, they provide the necessary context for researching character displacement.\n\nCharacter displacement has indicated to be a major factor in beak size among finches located in the Galápagos Islands and Hawaiian Islands.\n\nStudies have been performed in a wide variety of taxa—a few groups having disproportionately contributed to the understanding of character displacement: mammalian carnivores, Galapagos finches, anole lizards on islands, three-spined stickleback fish, and snails.\n\nIn the initial explication of character displacement, many of the examples set forth as potential evidence for character displacement were observations between multiple pairs of birds. These included rock nuthatches in Asia, Australian honeyeaters of the genus \"Myzantha\", Australian parrots, shearwaters in the Cape Verde Islands, flycatchers of the Bismarck Archipelago and notably, Darwin's finches in the Galapagos. David Lack found that when the two species \"Geospiza fortis\" and \"G. fuliginosa\" occurred on large islands together, they could be distinguished unequivocally by beak size. When either one occurred by itself on a smaller island, however, the beak size was intermediate in size relative to when the two co-occurred. Similarly, Peter and Rosemary Grant found that a \"Geospiza fortis\" island population diverged in beak size (due to high mortality) from competitor \"G. magnirostris\" in a year with low food supply, apparently due to increased competition for larger seeds that both species fed on. Most character displacement studies focus on morphological differences in feeding apparatus rather than on those relating to habitat use. However, comparisons of micro-habitat use and morphological adaptations of Western and Eastern Rock Nuthatches indicate that these two species show spatial niche segregation in addition to trophic niche segregation.\n\nIt is often assumed that closely related species are more likely to compete than are more distantly related species, and hence many researchers investigate character displacement among species in the same genus. While character displacement was originally discussed in the context of very closely related species, evidence suggests that even interactions among distantly related species can result in character displacement. Finches and bees in the Galapagos provide support for this. Two finch species (\"Geospiza fuliginosa\" and \"G. difficilis\") exploit more flower nectar on islands where the lager carpenter bee (\"Xylocopa darwini\") is absent than on islands with the bees. Individual finches that harvest nectar are smaller than members of the same species that do not.\n\nThe lizard genus \"Anolis\" on the islands in the Caribbean has also been the subject of numerous studies investigating the role of competition and character displacement in community structure. Lesser Antilles islands can only support \"Anolis\" species of different sizes, and the relative importance of character displacement versus size at colonization in determining invasion success has been explored and debated.\n\nThe Appalachian salamanders \"Plethodon hoffmani\" and \"P. cinereus\" display no morphological differences, eating habits, or resource use exploitation differences among allopatric populations; when the species occurs in sympatry; however, they exhibit morphological differentiation that is associated with segregation in prey size. Where these two species co-occur, \"P. hoffmani\" has a faster closing jaw required for larger prey, and \"P. cinereus\" has a slower, stronger jaw for smaller prey. Other studies have found \"Plethodon\" salamander species that demonstrate character displacement from aggressive behavioral interference rather than exploitation. That is, morphological character displacement between the two species is due to aggressive interaction between them rather than the exploitation of different food resources.\n\nOn Okinawa Island, the snail species \"Satsuma largillierti\" lives on the eastern half of the island, while \"Satsuma eucosmia\" lives on the western half. Both populations overlap in sympatry along the middle of the island, where the penis length of the species differs significantly wherer they meet in sympatry. The snails' penis lengths exhibit divergence, suggesting reproductive character displacement of this trait.\n\nThreespine sticklebacks (\"Gasterosteus\" spp.) in post-glacial lakes in western Canada have contributed significantly to recent research of character displacement. Both observations of natural populations and manipulative experiments show that when two recently evolved species occur in a single lake, two morphologies are selected for: a limnetic form that feeds in open water and a benthic form that feeds at the lake bottom. They differ in size, shape and the number and length of gill rakers, all of which is related to divergence in their diet. Hybrids between the two forms are selected against. When only one species inhabits a lake, that fish displays an intermediate morphology. Studies on other fish species have shown similar patterns of selection for benthic and limnetic morphologies, which can also lead to sympatric speciation.\n\nIntroduced species have also provided recent \"natural experiments\" to investigate how rapidly character displacement can affect evolutionary change. When American mink (\"Mustela vison\") were introduced in north-eastern Belarus, the native European mink (\"Mustela lutreola\") increased in size, and the introduced mink decreased in size. This displacement was observed within a ten-year study, demonstrating that competition can drive rapid evolutionary change.\n\n"}
{"id": "1889290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889290", "title": "Dragon Day", "text": "Dragon Day\n\nDragon Day is an annual event that occurs the Friday before spring break at Cornell University. The center of the event is the procession of a dragon, created by first-year architecture students at the Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning. The construction is funded by selling Dragon Day t-shirts.\n\nThe first event was in 1901. Believing that there should be a \"College of Architecture Day,\" student Willard Straight of the class of 1901 led a group of architecture students around campus carrying a model dragon. This was partly inspired by the legend of St. Patrick driving all the snakes and serpents from Ireland. Lincoln Hall, which housed the College of Architecture at the time, was decorated with orange and green banners, shamrocks, and themed decorations. In the 1950s, the event evolved into its current form, with an actual constructed dragon. It is unknown when the term \"Dragon Day\" was coined, but it likely came into use in the 1950s. Since then, the holiday has turned into a parade for the dragon. Although it is typically carried from beneath by architecture students, in 1964 and 1976 the dragon was mounted on a car and driven through the route. In 1985, the dragon fell over as it rounded Sibley Hall, and was not able to complete its route. In 2009, due to new New York State Department of Environmental Conservation regulations\n, the dragon was not burned at the end of the parade route; the dragon's \"nest\" was burned instead. Since the dragon can no longer be burned, various tactics have been employed to create a climactic spectacle. In 2012, first year architects squirted the dragon with paint. Notably, in 2013, the white dragon was colored with multicolored Holi powder throughout the parade and at the Arts Quad finale.\n\nDragon Day has been used as a form of political expression. At some point between its origin and 1920, the festivities were banned by Cornell's third president, Jacob Gould Schurman, because campus Catholics were offended by the theme. During the 1933-1934 school year, students constructed a large paper-mache beer stein to celebrate the repeal of Prohibition. In the 1950s, Dragon Day was cancelled in protest of Senator McCarthy's red scare. In 1968, the dragon was controversially painted entirely black in protest of the Vietnam War. In 1994, the possible cancellation of the \"Cornell in Rome\" architecture program prompted students to adopt a \"Fall of Rome\" theme.\n\nCampus pranks often surround Dragon Day. In 1966, a green pig was released into the Ivy Room, a dining hall, resulting in a massive food fight. In 1974, artist Oded Halahmy threatened to remove his outdoor sculptures from the campus after some were splattered with green paint and moved.The week before Dragon Day, the freshmen architects can be found running through campus lecture halls, barely clothed and painted green. That night they moon the windows of Uris Library's Cocktail Lounge. In 1990, the Department of Architecture severed all ties with the holiday due to the pranks, but began re-affiliating with it in 1993.\n\nSince the early 2000s, Nerd Walk has been an annual part of the event. The first-year students dress up and went through Cornell University libraries and engineering buildings (notably Duffield Hall) looking at books, attracting attention, and handing out quarter cards to advertise the Dragon Day event. \n\n Dragon Day signifies a rivalry between Cornell architecture students and those in the College of Engineering. During the second half of the 1980s, several incidents of violence between engineering and architecture students were associated with Dragon Day.\n\nBeginning in 1986, several attempts were made to channel engineers' frustrations into more creative outlets. In 1986, in the middle of the cold war, a group of civil engineering students prepared a mock ICBM which they carried in an effort to ram the dragon as it passed by the engineering quad. They were immediately stopped short by architects protecting their creation. In the spring of 1987, a larger group of engineering students came together to once again create an organized response to Dragon Day. In an effort to reduce chances of violence, the group chose to create a rather passive phoenix bird to hover over the engineering quad as the dragon passed by. Unfortunately, the helium filled giant metallized plastic balloon deflated by the time the dragon rolled around over two hours late.\n\nNot satisfied with this mediocre performance, the group founded the Phoenix Society and vowed to annually meet the dragon with an engineering avatar. Dropping the non-aggressive stance, the group unanimously voted to construct a knight on horseback in the spring of 1988. Two days before Dragon Day, architects managed to break into the engineers' workshop. Fortunately the leader of the architects persuaded his fellow students to leave the engineers' knight unharmed and the group only made off with the original Phoenix Society banner, a remnant of the original mylar phoenix balloon.\n\nThus the knight survived to confront the dragon, his horse rearing on his hind legs and his sword raised into the air. Following this first successful engineering confrontation with the dragon, a sporadic custom has developed, with varying themes: a Viking longboat in 1989, a cobra in 2001, a penguin in 2005.\n\nIn 1998 and 1999, an industrious engineer using 3/4\" bolt cutters managed to steal the steering wheel off of the car that the architects used for the frame of the dragon. The wheels were proudly displayed on the parapets of castles that the engineers constructed on the engineering quad to meet the dragon.\n\nThe holiday is still traditionally carried on by freshmen. The windows of Rand Hall, the former home of design studios of the Department of Architecture, are decorated in anticipation of the event.\n\nNot to be confused with the Engineer Knight of 1988, the Theatre, Film, and Dance Knight is a recent addition to Dragon Day, now created yearly by students from the Department of Performing and Media Arts with a budget of under $500, a build time of less than 48 hours, and a work team numbering between 5-20.\n\nThis tradition was begun partially as a student response to budget cuts handed down to the Department of Theatre, Film, and Dance by the College of Arts and Sciences and serves the dual purpose of establishing campus presence and proving departmental quality by submitting a float superior to its rivals. Chants during the event frequently make reference to the department overcoming these cuts.\n\nThe knight made its first appearance in the spring of 2011, when students from Cornell's Department of Theatre, Film, and Dance constructed a large knight-like figure brandishing a pole-arm and pulled it into Ho Plaza with the stated intention of \"slaying the dragon\". However, they were asked to kindly step to the side as the dragon passed through the square. The students complied, but then resorted to heckling the architects and chanting in protest of the budget cuts. The 2011 knight's final showing was a dramatic traversing of the Arts Quad, where the students alternated between chanting clever quips and singing \"We Shall Overcome\". \n\nIncarnations of the knight in past years have included a skeletal horseman atop a rearing horse in the spring of 2012, and the Black Knight from \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" in the spring of 2013, featuring a moving head controlled by a puppeteer and arm stumps that sprayed water at the surrounding crowd.\n\nThe knight serves as a student memorial to the Department of Theatre, Film, and Dance, which has since been renamed the Department of Performing and Media Arts.\n\n Starting in 2014, the physics community—motivated both by being left out of Dragon Day and also by the fact that like the architects and engineers, physicists are very capable of building things—has entered the fray of Dragon Day festivities. In 2014, a team of physicists—composed of mostly graduate students, but also some undergraduate students—constructed the first annual Physics Unicorn, modeled after Twilight Sparkle. The tradition was continued in 2015 with the creation of a silver unicorn army commanded by Tyrael—that is, a student dressed up as Tyrael.\n\nThe dragon 'float' is designed and constructed by the first-year architecture students. Construction takes place in Rand Hall shop and behind Rand Hall along University Ave. Over the years, the dragons have taken on various forms, sometimes incorporating moving elements, like wings, scales, and heads. Part of the dragon is mounted on a stripped car chassis, which is steered by a student. Dragon Day 2018 (Class of 2022) currently holds the record for the longest dragon, measuring approximately 140 feet.\n\n"}

This novel begins one year after the events of \"A Spell for Chameleon\", and describes the adventures of Bink after he has settled down with his pregnant wife, Chameleon. King Trent had appointed Bink the Official Researcher of Xanth at the end of the previous book, and given him the task to discover Xanth's source of magic. After many hazards, Bink and his companions succeed but Bink makes a moral choice that ends up destroying the magic of Xanth.\n\nAccording to Popular Science magazine, the book is the first time the word “de-extinction” was ever used. \n\nOn his way to Queen Iris's masquerade ball in honor of Trent's accession to the throne one year before, Bink is attacked by a floating sword, which he deflects using his talent of protection against magical harm. At the ball, he is attacked again by an unseen enemy. Finally, Bink confides in King Trent, who decides to remove Bink from harm's way by sending him out on a mission to find the source of magic of Xanth. To help him, King Trent sends Chester the Centaur and the soldier Crombie. Crombie is turned into a griffin by King Trent, whose magical talent is the ability to transform living things.\n\nFirst, the party heads to the Good Magician Humfrey's castle, to ask his advice about their quest. When they tell him they are attempting to discover Xanth's source of magic, Humfrey decides he wants to come as well. They come across Beauregard the Demon who tells them they should abandon their quest, as it could result in the destruction of all magic in Xanth. At this time they also find Grundy the Golem, whose talent is understanding any language. This is particularly useful because Crombie in griffin form can only speak in squawks, which Grundy is able to translate.\n\nOn their quest, they meet many obstacles, including a Siren, a Gorgon whose face turns men to stone, madness itself, a dragon, tangle trees, and an ogre. Bink narrowly escapes all enemies through a series of seemingly circumstantial events, due to his talent. Eventually they find the source of magic - a demon named X(A/N) imprisoned deep below the surface. Bink is faced with a moral dilemma, to let it be free and destroy all magic in Xanth and act against the Brain Coral, or to keep it against its will. He eventually lets the magic go by freeing the demon, but is convinced by Cherie Centaur to go back and look for the demon again, hoping to convince it to stay. After some negotiation, the demon agrees under the condition that the magic shield which separated Xanth from Mundania will protect him from foolish intruders.\n\nUpon Bink's return home, he discovers his son Dor possesses a magician caliber talent - he can talk to inanimate objects.\n\n"}

Since its creation during the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), the dish has been regarded as a Chinese delicacy known for its rich taste, and special manner of cooking. The dish's name is an allusion to the dish's ability to entice the vegetarian monks from their temples to partake in the meat-based dish. It is high in protein and calcium.\n\nConcerns over the sustainability and welfare of sharks have limited consumption and availability of the soup.\n\nThe soup or stew consists of many ingredients, especially animal products, and requires one to two full days to prepare. A typical recipe requires many ingredients including quail eggs, bamboo shoots, scallops, sea cucumber, abalone, shark fin, fish maw, chicken, Jinhua ham, pork tendon, ginseng, mushrooms, and taro. Some recipes require up to thirty main ingredients and twelve condiments. Use of shark fin, which is sometimes harvested by shark finning, and abalone, which is implicated in destructive fishing practices, are controversial for both environmental and ethical reasons.\n\nThere are many different stories about the origin of the dish. A common one is about a scholar traveling by foot during the Qing dynasty. While he traveled with his friends, the scholar preserved all his food for the journey in a clay jar used for holding wine. Whenever he had a meal, he warmed up the jar with the ingredients over an open fire. Once they arrived in Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province, the scholar started cooking the dish. The smells spread over to a nearby Buddhist monastery where monks were meditating. Although monks are not allowed to eat meat, one of the monks, tempted, jumped over the wall. A poet among the travelers said that even Buddha would jump the wall to eat the delicious dish.\n\nIn South Korea, the dish is known as \"Buldojang\" (불도장, the Korean reading of the same Chinese characters). It was first introduced in 1987 by Hu Deok-juk (), an ethnic Chinese chef from Taiwan at the Chinese restaurant Palsun (팔선), located in the Shilla Hotel in Seoul. The dish played an important role in changing the mainstream of Chinese cuisine consumed in South Korea from Sichuan cuisine to Cantonese cuisine. However, in 1989, the Jogye Order, the representative order of traditional Korean Buddhism, strongly opposed the selling of the dish because the name is considered a blasphemy to Buddhism. Although \"Buldojang\" temporarily disappeared, the dispute ignited the spreading of rumors among the public, and the dish consequently gained popularity. When President Moon Jae-in visited China, it was served at the state dinner.\n\nKai Mayfair in London was dubbed \"home of the world's most expensive soup\" when it unveiled its £108 version of Buddha Jumps Over the Wall in 2005. The dish includes shark's fin, Japanese flower mushroom, sea cucumber, dried scallops, chicken, Hunan ham, pork, and ginseng.\n\n"}

It was dissolved on 31 October 2011 as part of a wider Executive Reform, and was replaced by the Dirección Nacional de Inteligencia (DNI).\nDAS was tasked with providing security to state institutions and VIPs, providing judiciary police investigative services and serving as a counter-intelligence service to both external and internal threats. At DAS, citizens and foreigners living in Colombia could obtain their background records, a common requirement for a variety of transactions and services involving both state and private institutions. In addition, DAS was responsible for immigration control and the issuance of visas.\n\nPublic law 218 of 2000, at section 38, states that all employees of DAS were intelligence agents. DAS worked with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), an agency of the US government tasked with combating the trade of illegal narcotics.\n\nThe events that followed Jorge Eliécer Gaitán's assassination in 1948 provoked a violent riot in Bogotá, now known as the Bogotazo, which also started a further ten years of violence in all of Colombia known in Colombian history as La Violencia. These events also brought in a Military Government headed by General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. Within the policies implemented by this Government was the creation, by means of Presidential Decree 2872 of 1953, of an administrative department known as the Colombian Administrative Department of Intelligence Services, (SIC). This department was in charge of Internal and External Intelligence and was created with the purpose of having an agency within the framework of the State to handle matters of intelligence, security and Constitutional enforcement.\n\nPresident Alberto Lleras Camargo changed the course of the SIC when he issued the Decree 1717 of 18 July 1960, substituting the SIC with the \"Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad\" (DAS), or Administrative Department of Security.\n\nThe functions of the DAS were laid out by means of Decree 512 of 1989, passed during the administration of President Virgilio Barco Vargas. The DAS formally became the Security Organization of the State as an official, technical, professional and apolitical institution during the administration of President César Gaviria Trujillo, by means of Decree 2110 of 1992.\n\nDuring the administration of President Andrés Pastrana Arango and in compliance with the State Reform brought on by Law 489 of 1998, the Decrees 218 of 2000, and 1272 of 2000 modified the structure of the DAS, giving the DAS the same parameters, privileges and flexibility of a State Government Ministry.\n\nOn December 6, 1989, at 7:30 AM, the Medellín Cartel detonated a bus loaded with of explosives directly in front of the headquarters building in downtown Bogotá. The explosion left 49 dead, 600 wounded and hundreds of retail outlets completely destroyed. It is considered to be the second worst terrorist act in the history of Colombia after the bombing of Avianca Flight 203. It was also the second time the cartel attempted to kill DAS director Miguel Maza Márquez using an explosive device; the first attack on May 30, 1989, left four dead and 37 wounded.\n\nMembers of DAS have been previously accused of interacting with left-wing guerrillas, right-wing paramilitary, drug dealers and smugglers, among others.\n\nIn October 2005, the content of a tape arguably containing a conversation between Special Intelligence Group Director Enrique Ariza and other DAS members, apparently discussing plans to create an intelligence office with financing from illegal paramilitary groups, was published in the Colombian press. Unspecified sources accused Vice-Director José Miguel Narváez of allegedly leaking this tape as part of a setup in order to discredit DAS Director Jorge Noguera. Director Noguera resigned and Narváez was removed from command.\n\nSubsequently, was selected as the new DAS Director, together with the announcement of polygraph tests for DAS personnel and the creation of a commission tasked with proposing reforms and a restructuring of the DAS.\n\nBetween January and March 2006, new allegations came to light about DAS-paramilitary relations and former Director Noguera's potential involvement. President Uribe publicly asked Noguera to appear before the Attorney General's office, but Noguera refused alleging economic and security reasons. Noguera was then acting Consul in Milan, Italy. He later resigned, returned to the country and appeared before judicial authorities. On February 22, 2007 Noguera was arrested, accused of having ties to paramilitaries.\n\nOn June 11, 2008, the Colombian Supreme Court ordered the immediate release of Jorge Noguera. According to the José Alvear Restrepo Lawyers' Collective, Noguera was only released due to procedural defects; however the charges against him, conspiracy to commit a crime, misuse of authority through an arbitrary and unjust act, and improper use of classified or secret information, may still be prosecuted.\n\nOn October 24, 2008, the head of the DAS Maria del Pilar Hurtado stepped down from her post after allegations that the agency had conducted surveillance on Senator Gustavo Petro and other left-wing political opponents of President Álvaro Uribe Vélez.

A Conservative party politician, Abadía was the last president of the period known as the Conservative Hegemony, running unopposed and forming a one party Cabinet.\n\nAbadía, as a young lawyer, was a professor and MP. He was appointed as Minister of Education and Minister of Government by president Pedro Nel Ospina.\nIn 1926, Abadía runs for president as the sole candidate of the Colombian Conservative Party. The Colombian Liberal Party did not participate in this election. Thus, Abadía was elected president for the presidential term of 1926-1930. At the end of his term, a 20-year period of rule by the conservatives came to an end.\n\nAbadía, as president, had to face the difficult economic situation and world resection caused by the Great Depression. He was forced to apply the Law of 1922 by which the government was authorized to borrow money from foreign countries. His administration borrowed an enormous sum (70 million pesos) from the United States of America, mainly to promote publics works of infrastructure which greatly alleviated the unemployment situation. These borrowed funds were invested mainly in the construction of roadways, railways, waterways and sea ports.\n\nThe economy was in a severe depression and the unemployment was very high. This caused a widespread social and political unrest across the nation. The first signs of international communism appeared in the form of labor unions in 1928. The two major strikes, of tragic consequences, were the one in the banana growing region of the State of Magdalena against the United Fruit Company and the one in the State of Santander against the Tropical Oil Company. By 1929 the civil unrest had reached Bogotá, where the students of local Universities orchestrated street disturbances. The upraise and unrest was so violent, that Abadía had to impose Martial Law to control the situation of public order and try to restore peace and order in the country.\n\nDuring his administration, the Government was concerned with resolving longstanding territorial disputes with its Latin American neighbors. On 24 March 1928, the Abadía Administration under Manuel Esguerra, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Colombia to Managua, negotiated and signed the Esguerra-Bárcenas Treaty with José Bárcenas Meneses, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua, in which Nicaragua recognized the sovereignty of Colombia over the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina and by which Colombia ceded claims over the Mosquito Coast, both territories that belonged to Colombia \"uti possidetis juris\" following Independence from Spain. On 19 March 1928, Congress ratified the Salomón–Lozano Treaty signed on 24 March 1924 by Fabio Lozano Torrijos, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Colombia to Peru, and Alberto Salomón Osorio, the Minister of Foreign Relations of Peru, the treaty demarcated once and for all the border between Colombia and Peru, and put a temporary end to military activities between the two nations along the border. The last important border treaty during the Abadía Administration was signed on 15 November 1928 between Laureano García Ortiz, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Colombia to Brazil, and Otávio Mangabeira, Minister of External Relations of Brazil, the Mangabeira-García Ortiz Treaty was a response to Ecuadorian and Peruvian aspirations of gaining eastern access to Brazil by way of the Apaporis river, a tributary to the Caquetá/Japurá River, this treaty settled once and for all the Brazil–Colombia border.\n\nDuring his Administration, Abadía had to contend with the growing discontent of Colombian fruit workers in the Caribbean Region and the economical and political interests of the United States in the region. On November 1928, workers of the United Fruit Company in the Department of Magdalena mounted a strike protesting unfair labour practices and conditions imposed by the company to the workers and the community at large, the United States responded by threatening to mount a military invasion of some sort to bring to an end the strike. The Government responded by sending in the Military to quell the protests and arrest the labour workers accused of instigating the strike, what happened next is known as the Banana massacre where an undetermined number of people were killed by the Colombian Army; this event was recounted by Gabriel García Márquez in his novel \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\". This event marked the declined of the United Fruit Company influence in the region and created a large discontent among the population of the Caribbean Region towards the United States, the Liberal politician Jorge Eliécer Gaitán would mount a large campaign to investigate and bring into account the actions taken by the Abadía Administration in the handling of this event, his popularity rose in opposition to that of Abadía and the Conservative party, something that would bring about their decline soon after.\n\nBorn 5 July 1867 in \"Las Vegas de Los Padres\", his family's estate in Coello, Tolima, in the United States of Colombia, to Miguel Abadía C. and Arcelia Méndez.

{"id": "1889326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889326", "title": "Night Mare", "text": "Night Mare\n\nNight Mare is a fantasy novel by American writer Piers Anthony, the sixth book of the \"Xanth\" series . In the book, Xanth is under threat of a barbarian invasion from Mundania. Its only hope is the talents of the Magicians of Xanth and an exiled night mare, sent to the world of waking with the dire message: \"Beware the Horseman.\"\n\n\"Night Mare\" centres around Mare Imbrium, one of the night mares charged with delivering bad dreams to the people of Xanth. Imbri carries half a soul, her fee for carrying Chem Centaur out of the void in the previous book. She is unwilling to relinquish her soul, though the conscience that comes with it impedes her ability to deliver bad dreams. The Night Stallion, ruler of the gourd realm, makes Imbri the liaison to the day and night world and sends her to meet Trent, King of Xanth, with the ominous message, \"Beware the Horseman\".\n\nImbri leaves the gourd realm and journeys to the day world, at first flinching from the touch of sunlight but realizing it would not harm her, though it nullified her ability to turn invisible and intangible. She sets out for Castle Roogna, determined to deliver the Stallion's message to King Trent. Along the way she meets a white stallion (wearing a \"thin brass band about his left foreleg, at ankle height\"), which is rare in Xanth, because the offspring of most of the horses are half-breed animals like centaurs, created by the crossbreeding most commonly induced by love springs. The \"Day Horse\" as she refers to him, is scared by her attempt at contact via a brief daydream, and runs away.\n\nShe also meets an intelligent man wearing a brass bracelet, similar to that of the Day Horse, on his left arm. He asks her if she has seen the horse and says that he is wearing a bracelet like the one on his own arm. He convinces her to allow him to ride so they can track the Day Horse, but when she becomes confused by his verbal commands, she allows him to insert a bit into her mouth. Realizing she dislikes the bit, she asks him to remove it. When he refuses, she orders him off her, and to suborn her will to his, he uses spurs on her, and captures her.\n\nImbri asks the man who he is, and he says \"I am the Horseman\". He then corrals her at his camp and builds a large bonfire to shine light on her and prevent her from turning intangible during the night. As the Horseman and his henchmen sleep, the Day Horse approaches and courts her. She tells him of her plight and he affirms that he is terrified of the Horseman. The Day Horse, assists her anyway, and urinates on the fire, enabling her to escape.\n\nImbri escapes and makes her way to Castle Roogna. When she arrives, the castle is preparing for the wedding of Prince Dor and King Trent's daughter, Princess Irene. Upon becoming acquainted with Chameleon, the wife of Bink and mother of Prince Dor, she is led to find King Trent, only to discover that he has been ensorcelled, staring blankly into space.\n\nPrince Dor, next in line to the crown and newly wed to Princess Irene, assumes the throne. He informs Imbri and others that the Nextwave Invasion is occurring; an army of barbarians from the neighbouring, non-magical land of Mundania has just entered Xanth. King Dor orders Imbri and Chameleon to seek advice from the Good Magician Humphrey.\n\nImbri and Chameleon travel to Humphrey's castle and navigate through the standard three challenges, gaining access to the inside. Humphrey's wife, the fearsome Gorgon, leads the pair to the Magician. The old man casually repeats the Night Stallion's warning, \"Beware the Horseman\" and adds another cryptic instruction: \"Break the chain.\"\n\nAfter battling the Mundanes with King Trent's army from \"A Spell For Chameleon\", Dor had fallen to the same ensorcellement as King Trent, and is now catatonic. Since the law of Xanth requires that a Magician sit on the throne, the Zombie Master (Jonathon) becomes the new king. Jonathan's magic talent is to reanimate the deceased, and he rallies his zombies to form an army to fight the Punic invasion from Mundania.\n\nJonathan falls to the same bewitchment as Trent and Dor. Humphrey assumes the throne, and prepares himself for battle against the Punic horde and its leader Hasbinbad. He informs Imbri, much to the chagrin of the Gorgon, that he is not destined to be the saviour of Xanth, and that he expects to make a tragic mistake in battle.\n\nBefore departing to the battle, Humphrey identified his successor: Dor's father Bink, whom everybody assumed had no magic talent. Humphrey revealed to Queen Iris that Bink's talent was immunity from magical harm, and its nature had been hidden so his enemies would not revert to using non-magical means to harm him. It was hoped that Bink would be immune from the effects of the Horseman's spell. Imbri was sent north to the border of Mundania, where Bink and the centaur scholar Arnolde were travelling. Imbri brought news to Bink and Arnolde of the invasion, and informed Bink that he was slated to become King of Xanth upon Humphrey's demise. Bink agreed to accompany Imbri back to the castle and instructed Arnolde to follow, for Arnolde would be king after Bink fell.\n\nBink and Imbri travelled to the baobab tree and find Humphrey, taken by the power of the enemy. He has a bottle in his hand, and when Bink uncorks it, Humphrey's voice emits from it, with one word: \"Horseman\". Bink surmises that Humphrey's voice was identifying his assailant, and that they now knew who was ensorcelling the kings. Bink and Imbri prepare for battle alone, armed with Humphrey's numerous spells and potions. They set aside a box marked \"Pandora\". He and Imbri are victorious but are separated in the battle. When Imbri tracks down Bink, she finds that he has killed the Punic leader Hasbinbad, but has been taken with the Horseman's power nonetheless. Imbri returns to Castle Roogna to inform Arnolde the Centaur that he is now King of Xanth.\n\nArnolde begins laying plans for his successor, and he interprets Xanthian law to his advantage. The law states that the king must be a Magician but had no precedence on whether the king had to be human or what sex. Arnolde states that a Sorceress is simply a female Magician, and that the law does not prohibit a woman from becoming king. He selects Queen Iris to be his successor, and he proclaims her daughter Irene to be a full Sorceress, thus establishing who would be the seventh and eights kings after him. Arnolde then instructs Imbri to report to the Night Stallion with an update.\n\nKing Arnolde, realising that the previous king's condition is similar to that of a person trapped by the hypno gourd, sends Imbri through, to the Night Stallion's dimension, to see if the missing Kings are within. Upon arrival, Imbri is amazed to learn that all five of the bewitched kings are present in the gourd. They surmise that the Horseman's magic talent is to connect a person's line of sight to another object, and that he has used this ability to make them all see into a hypnogourd, trapping their souls inside.\n\nImbri brings this news to Castle Roogna, and eventually brings Princess Irene to the gourd to visit her new husband Dor, taken from her after their nuptials. Shortly after the pair return to Castle Roogna, Arnolde is taken by the Horseman, and Queen Iris becomes King Iris, the first female king.\n\nIris uses her talent of illusion to inflict massive casualties on the Punic horde, who are now marching on Castle Roogna under the command of the Horseman. She briefly forms an image of her own face in front of the Horseman to mock him, whereupon he simply uses his talent to enscroll her. Princess Irene becomes king of Xanth next, and she identifies Chameleon as the next king, stating that, although Chameleon does not have Magician-Caliber talent, she would be the best option for king because she is in her ugly, but extremely intelligent phase.\n\nThe Horseman expends nearly the rest of his forces in reaching Castle Roogna. Chameleon, realising that the Day Horse and the Horseman are one and the same, lures him into the castle, and once he is inside, Irene uses her talent of accelerated plant growth to wrap the castle in a tight cocoon of plants, trapping him inside. Enraged, he uses his magic to ensnare her, whereupon Chameleon becomes king of Xanth and informs him that he will fail. He takes Chameleon with his power, too, and Xanth is left without a king.\n\nImbri, having been previously named the Tenth King by Chameleon, because she is a creature of the Gourd, and can not enter the world via the peep hole, and therefore can not be forced into it, returns to castle Roogna.\n\nImbri enters Roogna at night, so she is able to slip by the plants, and confronts the Horseman. He is now sitting on the throne, having proclaimed himself the new king of Xanth. As Imbri approaches, he shifts into his alternate form, and Imbri is stricken; she is in season, and he is a male horse. She is unable to act under his dominating power, but when the barbarians break into the castle and call out for their leader, he shifts back to his human form to answer. Imbri attacks and kills him, but the nine catatonic kings do not revive.\n\nImbri realizes that the Horseman's magic talent was shape-shifting, and that the bands he wore around his wrists were magical bands that allowed him to perform his enscrollement. Devastated, and with nothing to lose, she destroys the box marked PANDORA, and is surrounded by a pink smoke, and feels suddenly hopeful. She removes the band but does not destroy it, because that might not accomplish the goal of releasing the kings. She decides to travel to the Void, an area in the Elemental region of Xanth, from which nothing can escape. She takes the band there and throws it in, but is trapped by the gravitational pull of the Void. Terrified, her physical body is destroyed by the Void.\n\nThe nine kings revive as the magical band is destroyed, and Imbri returns as a day mare, thanks to Humfrey, and is now charged with bringing pleasant daydreams instead of nightmares to the people of Xanth. King Trent and Queen Iris retire, leaving the throne to their new son-in-law, King Dor.\n\n"}
{"id": "1889327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889327", "title": "Ziva Kunda", "text": "Ziva Kunda\n\nZiva Kunda (June 13, 1955 – February 24, 2004) was a social psychologist well known for her work in social cognition and motivated reasoning as well as the textbook, \"Social Cognition: Making Sense of People\". She was born in Tel Aviv.\n\nKunda was born in Tel Aviv in 1955. Her parents were from Oudtshoorn, a small South African town. They immigrated from different parts of Europe to Oudtshoorn to find safety from the persecutions of Jews before and during World War II. In Kunda's autobiography, she shares her parents' background, their parents, and her early childhood. \n\nKunda obtained her PhD and MA in Psychology in 1985 at the University of Michigan, and her BA in Psychology at the University of Jerusalem in 1978. Directly after finishing her PhD, she became an Assistant Professor at Princeton University in the Psychology Department. In 1992, she moved to Waterloo, Ontario, where she was Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Waterloo. In 1997, she became a full Professor. Kunda's profile on the Social Psychology Network is actively maintained by social psychologist Scott Plous, in order to provide a resource for those interested in Kunda's work.\n\nIn 1999, Kunda authored the textbook \"Social Cognition: Making Sense of People\"; one of the books she is well known for. In this book, Kunda begins by painting a picture of the birth of social psychology and cognitive psychology. Before the prominence of these fields, psychology was dominated by behavioral psychology which focused on studying only observable human behavior; B. F. Skinner's \"black box\" framed any internal happenings of the human mind as an enigma that should not be explored. However, Kunda highlights in the book how, with the rise of the study of cognition in the 1950s and beyond due to the increase of technological research tools (fMRI, EEG, etc), cognitive scientists began to break down the barriers to understanding human cognition. Kunda covers many topics in the book, from stereotyping and emotional effects on cognition to judgements and behavior. She points out that the topic of social cognition, unique in that most humans have interacted with other humans and therefore have many personal experiences with this research field, collects many presumptions from \"lay people\" and psychologists alike. Kunda therefore emphasizes not only what the theories of social cognition are, but also how the theories and empirical findings were developed to highlight efficacy.\n\nKunda wrote as an overview of her research: One line of my work examines how stereotypes are activated, used, and modified. Under what circumstances, for example, will the stereotypes of an ethnic or an occupational group come to mind as one is interacting with a member of these groups? How will a person's behavior influence which of the stereotypes relevant to that person are on one's mind? Under what circumstances will relevant stereotypes influence one's evaluation of a person? Another line of my work examines how outstanding individuals influence people's self-views and motivation. When will a superstar give rise to inspiration and self-enhancement, and when to discouragement and self-deflation? This contextual understanding of how people stereotype added a new dimension to this body of work. Specifically, Kunda's work with Stephen Spencer looked at temporal aspects of stereotyping in their paper \"When Do Stereotypes Come to Mind and When Do They Color Judgment?\" They found that when someone is engaging with another individual in a stereotyped group, that person is not always thinking about the group's stereotype. When they do think about the stereotype, the stereotype does not always play a role in their judgements. Kunda also found that when stereotypes change, they usually do so incrementally or through causal reasoning.\n\nHer paper \"The Case for Motivated Reasoning\", published in \"Psychological Bulletin\" in 1990, posthumously received the Scientific Impact Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. In this paper, Kunda describes how, when reasoning, humans usually arrive at the conclusion they want to, but this is limited by whether or not they are able to provide justifications for this conclusion. She highlights the danger if, instead of taking this self-affirming bias into account, we perceive our own and others' reasoning as objective. Finally, she notes that truly objective reasoning is often needed to explore the full range of possible outcomes.\n\nIn 2004, Kunda died from cancer. She is survived by her husband Paul Thagard, a professor of philosophy at the University of Waterloo, and two sons.\n\n\n"}

Therefore you are free to imagine what you like.\"\n\nThe process of creating the album \"required tremendous patience and self-abnegation\", with Stevens noting that he \"amassed hours (months, years) of raw material\" until he \"was left with the most minute sample of something ... which might somehow, in some abstract way, resemble an ox, or a rooster, or a horse\". Like much of Stevens' music, \"Enjoy Your Rabbit\" had a religious component in its conception, with Stevens describing how he \"put together argumentative essays, stanzas of free verse poetry, persuasive dissertations and assertions ... to prove the existence of God based on the 12-year lunar calendar.\"\n\n\"Enjoy Your Rabbit\" received generally positive reviews. Michael Crumsho of \"Dusted\" described it as \"a great record\", noting Stevens' ability to \"produce melodies that are uplifting, catchy and memorable\" but critically remarking that it \"remains to be seen, however, if Sufjan will learn that the most elaborate path from Point A to B is not necessarily the best\". Jason Nickey of \"Pitchfork\" referred to \"Enjoy Your Rabbit\" positively as \"a fully realized piece of work\" and noted he is \"looking forward to seeing where [Stevens] goes from here\". Writing for AllMusic, Nickey also commented on how the album \"maps out a wide musical territory ... in the process, evoking a surprising array of moods\".\n\n\n"}

Its elevation is . As of the 2010 census it had a population of 1,080.\n\nA post office has been in operation at Alamo since 1905. The community was named in commemoration of the Battle of the Alamo. A large share of the first settlers were Mormons.\n\nAlamo lies in the Pahranagat Valley. Its economy is dependent primarily upon ranching. The closest attraction is the Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nBetween Alamo and the town of Rachel is the site of the Devonian Alamo Impact Breccia.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Alamo census-designated place has an area of , all of it land.\nAlamo attracts tourists and truckers traveling from Las Vegas to northern Nevada and Idaho. Attractions include the nearby warm springs, wildlife refuge, Extraterrestrial Highway and Area 51. Gas stations in Alamo cater to these tourists by offering alien memorabilia. There are two truck stops, the Alamo Sinclair, the Ash Springs Shell, that offer large diesel filling areas to attract passing truckers. There are also four motels in Alamo, the Alamo Inn, Sunset View Inn, Windmill Ridge, and A Cowboy's Dream.\n\n\nPublic education is provided by the Lincoln County School District, with offices in Panaca, Nevada. There are three schools in the valley.\nThere are three different religious denominations with churches in Alamo:\n\n\nAlamo has a police force, a volunteer fire department, phone and internet services, a medical clinic, and a public library. Nevada Bank and Trust offers financial services to residents. Alamo's first radio station, KQLN 91.3 FM, went on the air on November 17, 2010, but the station's license was cancelled at licensee's request, effective on July 2, 2013.\n\nAlamo, Nevada, with an average annual temperature of 56.7 Fahrenheit, has a cold-desert climate (Koppen BWk). Although it is technically a cold desert, the town lies in the middle of the climatic transition zone between the hotter, lower Mojave desert to the south, and the colder, higher Great Basin desert to the North. It exhibits characteristics of both deserts, such as scorching summers (July afternoon maxima average around 100 F), large diurnal temperature range year round, and snow at least once a year. December and January record highs are within 2 degrees of Las Vegas. Unlike Las Vegas, summer nights are comfortable, even cool, having the ability to dip below 60, even in thermal midsummer. This is due to a lack or urban heat island, location in a valley, dry air, and clear skies typical of a summer day.\n\nDecember and January are the coldest months, and are climatologically equivalent in terms of temperature records. Beginning in early March, the days begin to warm noticeably along with rapidly increasing day length. Nights remain cold to cool throughout spring. By late April, afternoon highs are warm and comfortable, perhaps a misleading prelude to the scorching hot summers. Because it is located in the Mojave desert, most annual precipitation occurs from the passage of fronts originating from the Pacific. These storms usually arrive by November, and taper off by April or May. The first hot days, with afternoon maxima over 90, typically occur by early May and maxima over 100 by early June. The annual temperature increases most rapidly during April and May. By June, the typical summer pattern dominates. Clear skies, blazing sunshine, and low humidity describe most days. Very hot days are tempered by the low humidity, and almost always the Heat Index is lower than the air temperature. July is the prototypical summer month, exhibiting long, hot days, clear skies, and rapidly plummeting temperatures after sunset. This summer pattern holds at least until late August. The pattern is, however, occasionally interrupted by rain and thunderstorms due to the yearly occurrence of the Arizona monsoon, which usually arrives by early July. The Arizona Monsoon is an annual shift in wind direction, pulling moisture into the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, even as far west as California's Central Valley, and as far north as Salt Lake City. High winds, lightning, flooding, and hail are potential hazards during the summer months. The Arizona Monsoon explains the secondary precipitation maximum.\n\nBy September, the climate system suffers a net energy loss due to the decreasing solar zenith angle, the nights become colder than the days heat up; the first signs of fall begin. Most noticeable is the nights transition from comfortable to cool or even cold (<50 F). Moisture associated with the Arizona monsoon usually ends by mid-September. October brings warm days, cool to cold nights, and shorter days. Temperatures climatologically drop the most in October, both temperature averages and extremes. By November, the days are still comfortable, yet cool, and Pacific storms begin to make their annual appearance. Late November into early December winter holds its grip until next February at least, when the cycle repeats itself. Unlike towns further north, such as Ely, winters are mild to cool, and sub-zero temperatures are almost unheard of. This is a testament to Alamo occupying the climatic transition zone between the Mojave and Great Basin Deserts.\n"}

B. Kerferd, a merchant (or Joseph Kerferd, a bookkeeper, and his wife Rachel, \"née\" Blundell) Kerferd was educated at the Collegiate Institute, Liverpool, with intentions of studying law; however circumstances led him to enter his father's business. Kerferd emigrated to Victoria in 1853 with plans to open a branch of the family business, but this did not eventuate. After trying his luck as a gold miner at Bendigo, he settled in Beechworth and became a brewer and wine merchant. He was mayor of Beechworth 1863-64 and three other occasions. In 1853 he married Ann Martindale, with whom he had ten children. Kerferd was admitted to the Melbourne bar in 1867 but did not practise as a lawyer.\n\nKerferd was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the Ovens in November 1864, and represented the area continuously until February 1886. \nHe began studying law in 1864 and was Minister for Mines and Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works in the government of James McCulloch 1868, and Solicitor-General 1872–1874, and Attorney-General in 1874 in the government of James Francis. When the Francis government was defeated in July 1874, Kerferd succeeded him at the head of a new conservative ministry.\n\nKerferd's Treasurer, James Service, was, like most colonial conservatives, a convinced free trader, and the government's 1875 budget proposed repealing the tariffs imposed by Charles Gavan Duffy's liberal government, and replacing the lost revenue with a land tax and a tax on beer and spirits. But this offended both the landowners and the business community, and Kerferd's government was defeated in August 1875.\n\nKerferd was again appointed as Attorney-General in later conservative governments (1875–1877, 1880 and 1883–86, in the Service government). In 1883 Kerferd was a Victorian representative to the federal convention. In 1886, he quit politics and on 1 January 1886 was appointed to the Supreme Court of Victoria. The appointment was not without controversy as several barristers had served longer in the legal profession, but Kerferd had eight years as attorney-general. There was general agreement that Kerferd filled his role as judge with great ability. Kerferd served as a judge until his death in 1889 while on a holiday at Sorrento, Victoria.\n\nKerferd Road in Albert Park is named after him.\nKerferd Road, later Avenue, in Sorrento is also named after him.\n\n\n"}

(play)\n\nJ.B. is a 1958 play written in free verse by American playwright and poet Archibald MacLeish and is a modern retelling of the story of the biblical figure Job – hence the title: J.B./Job. The play went through several incarnations before it was finally published. MacLeish began the work in 1953 as a one-act production but within three years had expanded it to a full three-act manuscript.\n\nThere are two versions of \"J.B.\" available: the original book, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and the script which MacLeish revised substantially for Broadway, published by Samuel French Inc.\n\nThe play opens in \"a corner inside an enormous circus tent\". Two vendors, Mr. Zuss (evoking the chief Greek god Zeus) and Nickles (i.e. \"Old Nick,\" a folk name for the Devil) begin the play-within-a-play by assuming the roles of God and Satan, respectively. They overhear J.B., a wealthy New York banker, describe his prosperity as a just reward for his faithfulness to God. Scorning him, Nickles wagers that J.B. will curse God if his life is ruined. Nickles and Zuss then watch as J.B.'s children are killed and his property is ruined and the former millionaire is left to the streets. J.B. is then visited by three Comforters: Bildad, Eliphaz and Zophar (representing History, Science, and Religion) who each offer a different explanation for his plight. J.B. declines to believe any of them, instead asking God himself to explain. Instead he encounters Zuss and Nickles. Nickles urges him to commit suicide in order to spite God; Zuss offers him his old life back if he will promise to obey God. J.B. rejects them both, and instead finds comfort in the person of his wife Sarah. The play ends with the two building a new life together.\n\nA first production was mounted by the Yale School of Drama at the Yale University Theater, New Haven, opening April 23, 1958. Brooks Atkinson wrote: \"Being in an expansive mood, Archibald MacLeish has written an epic of mankind. He calls it \"J. B.\" It was acted for the first time at the Yale University Theatre last evening.\" Directed by F. Curtis Canfield, the cast included James Shepherd as J.B.\n\nThe three-act version premiered on Broadway at the ANTA Playhouse on December 11, 1958 and closed on October 24, 1959 after 364 performances. Directed by Elia Kazan, the cast included Raymond Massey, Christopher Plummer, Nan Martin, Ivor Francis, Pat Hingle (J.B.), Clifton James, Judith Lowry, Candy Moore, James Olson, Ford Rainey, and Andreas Voutsinas. Brooks Atkinson wrote: \"For 'J. B.,' the title of Archibald MacLeish's new play at the ANTA Theatre, read 'Everyman.' Looking around at the wreckage and misery of the modern world, Mr. MacLeish has written a fresh and exalting morality that has great stature.\"\n\nAn Off-Broadway production by the Equity Library Theatre opened on March 17, 1962, at the Master Theatre, starring John Cazale.\n\nThe play was performed at the University of Nevada in Reno and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1963, in College Park Maryland at the University of Maryland in 1965,Hannibal-LaGrange College, Hannibal, MO in 1966, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, in 1971.\n\n\nThe ANTA Playhouse production won the 1959 Tony Awards for Best Play and Best Direction.\n\nThe play won the 1959 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The Pulitzer Prize committee wrote: \" 'Certainly no other play of this or many seasons has attempted to come to grips with so large and universal a theme and succeeded in stating it in terms more eloquent, moving, provocative' than J.B.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1889415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889415", "title": "Transplants (band)", "text": "Transplants (band)\n\nTransplants are an American punk rock/rap rock supergroup. They formed in 1999 when Tim Armstrong (of the bands Rancid and Operation Ivy) played his friend and roadie Rob Aston some beats he had made using Pro Tools and asked Aston if he would consider contributing lyrics. Initially, Armstrong played all the instruments himself, but as the project grew, he invited musician friends such as Matt Freeman (Rancid), Lars Frederiksen (Rancid), and Vic Ruggiero (The Slackers) to add to the sound. Before long, Armstrong and Aston decided to officially form a band, but to make things complete, they wanted a drummer, so Travis Barker from Blink-182 was asked to join in 2002.\n\nAfter the release of their first album, Transplants briefly disbanded in 2003, due to all members being involved in their own projects, including Rancid and Blink-182. Then in 2004, they reunited to record their second album (\"Haunted Cities\") before going on hiatus again until 2010 when the band started to record new material. This new material was released as \"In a Warzone\" in 2013.\n\nAfter two years of recording, Transplants released their debut album \"Transplants\" on Hellcat Records in October 2002. In the end, the album was recorded and mixed entirely in Armstrong's basement. Special guest vocalists included Eric Ozenne (The Nerve Agents), Davey Havok (AFI), Son Doobie (Funkdoobiest), Danny Diablo (Crown of Thornz, AKA Lord Ezec), Lars Frederiksen (Rancid) and Brody Dalle (The Distillers, ex-wife of Armstrong). Brody sings on the track \"Weigh on My Mind\", which Armstrong, at the time, described as \"their song.\"\n\nThe singles \"Diamonds and Guns\" and \"D.J. D.J.\" quickly became MTV favorites and earned the band critical and commercial success. \"Diamonds and Guns\" and its unmistakable piano hook played by co-producer Dave Carlock was featured in TV commercials for Garnier Fructis shampoo and Neutrogena, and both this and the song \"Tall Cans in the Air\" were featured on the soundtrack for the 2003 movie \"Bulletproof Monk\".\n\nBy 2003, the band had temporarily disbanded, while Barker worked on then-upcoming Blink-182 album, and Armstrong worked on Rancid's \"Indestructible.\"\n\nIn 2004, during an extensive Rancid hiatus, Armstrong decided to bring Transplants back together. The band's second album, titled \"Haunted Cities\", was released in June 2005, just four months after Barker's former band Blink-182 announced their hiatus.\n\nThe album's first single, \"Gangsters and Thugs\" was a hit and the band began touring on the 2005 Warped Tour. After the Warped Tour, Transplants started to plan a large North American tour with Pennywise and wanted to release a second single. The band shot and released another video for the single \"What I Can't Describe.\" The band released the Chopped and screwed version of \"\" on November 1, 2005.\n\nSoon after the cancellation of the tour, two band members announced several more side projects that they would be embarking on during Transplants break. Barker revealed that he would be starting a tour with DJ AM and also a new band with Aston and DJ Paul Wall which would become Expensive Taste. Aston revealed that he was working on a solo album.\n\nIn an interview with Aston and Paul Wall on January 16, 2006 about their project, Expensive Taste, Aston stated \"The Warped Tour had just ended and Transplants had just broken up\". This led to some confusion over whether the band had officially broken up, or not. Despite the statement made by Aston about how the band had \"broken up\", frontman Tim Armstrong contradicted this statement on a MySpace bulletin. He stated: \"In the upcoming years, I hope to make another Transplants album. I love recording with those guys\".\n\nFrom 2006 to 2009, Transplants had been \"on hold\", as all the members had continued working on their own projects. Armstrong was busy touring with Rancid promoting their new album, \"Let the Dominoes Fall\". He also released his solo album, \"A Poet's Life\", in 2007. Travis Barker worked on an album with a recently reformed Blink-182, who toured during the summer of 2009, and also formed a new band called Expensive Taste, along with Aston.\n\nIn January 2010, Barker announced on his Twitter account that Transplants were reunited and are in fact recording new material in 2010. The band announced that their new website will be posted in February 2011. It was also announced that the third album will be released on the band's original home at Hellcat Records.\n\nArmstrong and Aston appeared as guests on Barker's first solo album \"Give the Drummer Some\" along with former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash on a Latin rock influenced song called \"Saturday Night\". The band performed the song live on \"Conan\" March 7, 2011, with Mix Master Mike on turntables, Elvis Cortez on guitar and Kevin Bivona on bass. Slash did not take part in the performance.\n\nIn an interview with 29-95 in April 2011, Barker has revealed that material for the Transplants album has been written since August 2010, and that 16 songs were already written by Armstrong, Aston and Barker for the album. He has also said that he expects around 30 songs to be written, with the best 12 to 15 making the cut.\n\nOn November 13, 2011, an announcement was made from the band's official Facebook page that they will be finishing up their new album in December. On November 29, Armstrong revealed that the album is slated for a spring 2012 release date, which will be followed by a new Rancid album in that summer.\n\nOn December 16, 2011, Aston posted a photo on Facebook revealing Kevin \"Sweatshop\" Bivona as the newest member.\n\nAfter assorted announcements during 2012, the third album, titled \"In a Warzone\", was finally released June 25, 2013. The first single, \"In a Warzone\", came out April 2, 2013; a second single, \"Come Around\", was released the following week on April 9.\n\nOn February 28, 2014, it was revealed on the band's official Facebook page, that the band had begun writing and recording new material.\n\nOn April 28, 2015, Barker announced that Transplants are almost finished with the recording of several cover songs. He released a list with song titles including songs by bands like Circle Jerks, Unwritten Law, Cypress Hill, Minor Threat, Beastie Boys, House of Pain, and Sepultura. On January 19, 2017, Barker confirmed that Transplants will be releasing a covers album.\n\nOn June 6, 2017, the band posted \"Friday the 13th. October 2017.\" on their Facebook page, which leads to rumors this might be the date for the release of the announced record. On July 29, 2017, the band announced on their Facebook page that the new record will be released on October 13 2017. It will be an EP named \"Take Cover\". The announcement was repeated on September 22. On October 6, 2017, Transplants announced the track list for \"Take Cover\". The EP will consist of 7 songs.\n\nThe EP \"Take Cover\" was released as planned on the 13th October 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1889422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889422", "title": "French battleship Paris", "text": "French battleship Paris\n\nParis was the third ship of four s, the first dreadnoughts built for the French Navy. She was completed before World War I as part of the 1911 naval building programme. She spent the war in the Mediterranean, spending most of 1914 providing gunfire support for the Montenegrin Army until her sister ship was torpedoed by the submarine on 21 December. She spent the rest of the war providing cover for the Otranto Barrage that blockaded the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic Sea.\n\n\"Paris\" supported French and Spanish troops in 1925 during the Third Rif War before becoming a school ship in 1931. She was modernized in three separate refits between the wars even though she was not deemed to be a first-class battleship. She remained in that role until the Battle of France, which began on 10 May 1940, after which she was hastily rearmed. She supported Allied troops in the defence of Le Havre during June until she was damaged by a German bomb, but she took refuge later that month in England. As part of Operation Catapult, she was seized in Plymouth by British forces on 3 July. She was used as a depot ship and barracks ship there by the Royal and Polish Navies for the rest of the war. Returned to the French in July 1945 she was towed to Brest the following month and used as a depot ship until she was stricken on 21 December 1955.\n\nBy 1909 the French Navy was finally convinced of the superiority of the all-big-gun battleship like over the mixed-calibre designs like the which had preceded the \"Courbet\"s. The following year, the new Minister of the Navy, Augustin Boué de Lapeyrère, selected a design that was comparable to the foreign dreadnoughts then under construction to be built as part of the 1906 Naval Programme. The ships were long overall and had a beam of and a mean draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew numbered 1,115 men as a private ship and increased to 1,187 when serving as a flagship. The ships were powered by two licence-built Parsons steam turbine sets, each driving two propeller shafts. \"Paris\" had 24 Belleville boilers to provide steam for her turbines. These boilers were coal-burning with auxiliary oil sprayers and were designed to produce . The ships had a designed speed of . The \"Courbet\"-class ships carried enough coal and fuel oil to give them a range at a speed of .\n\nThe main battery of the \"Courbet\" class consisted of twelve \"Canon de mle 1906–1910\" guns mounted in six twin-gun turrets, with two pairs of superfiring turrets fore and aft of the superstructure, and a pair of wing turrets amidships. Their secondary armament was twenty-two \"Canon de mle 1910\" guns, which were mounted in casemates in the hull. Four \"Canon de mle 1902\" Hotchkiss guns were fitted, two on each broadside in the superstructure. They were also armed with four submerged torpedo tubes and could stow 10 mines below decks. The ships' waterline belt ranged in thickness from and was thickest amidships. The gun turrets were protected by 250 mm of armour and plates protected the casemates. The curved armoured deck was thick on the flat and on the outer slopes. The conning tower had thick face and sides.\n\nThe ship was ordered on 1 August 1911 and named after the French capital city. She was laid down on 10 November 1911 by Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée at its shipyard in La Seyne and launched on 28 September 1912. Due to the rising tensions in Europe in mid-1914, the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 1 August before she was formally completed on 14 August at a cost of F63,000,000. \"Paris\" was assigned to the 1st Division (\"1ère Division\") of the 2nd Battle Squadron (\"2ème Escadre de ligne\") of the 1st Naval Army (\"1ère Armée Navale\") on 1 August, but did not join her squadron until 5 September.\n\nAfter working up she was sent, along with her sisters, to the Mediterranean Sea. She spent most of the rest of 1914 providing gunfire support for the Montenegrin Army until hit \"Jean Bart\" on 21 December with a torpedo. This forced the battleships to fall back to either Malta or Bizerte to cover the Otranto Barrage. After the French occupied the neutral Greek island of Corfu in 1916 she moved forward to Corfu and Argostoli, but her activities were very limited as much of her crew was used to man anti-submarine ships. Before the end of the war she was fitted with seven Mle 1897 anti-aircraft (AA) guns in single mounts. These guns were adaptions of the famous French Mle 97 75-mm field gun.\n\n\"Paris\" was sent to Pula on 12 December 1918 to supervise the surrendered Austro-Hungarian fleet, where she remained until 25 March 1919. She provided cover for Greek troops during the Occupation of İzmir (Smyrna) from May 1919 before returning to Toulon on 30 June 1919. She collided with the destroyer \"Bouclier\" at Toulon on 27 June 1922; both ships suffered severe damage.\n\n\"Paris\" received the first of her upgrades at Brest between 25 October 1922 and 25 November 1923. This included replacing one set of boilers with oil-fired boilers, increasing the maximum elevation of the main armament from 12° to 23°, removal of her bow armour to make her less bow-heavy, the installation of a fire-control director, with a rangefinder, and the exchange of her Mle 1897 AA guns for Mle 1918 guns. After her return to service she supported an amphibious landing at Al Hoceima by Spanish troops during the summer of 1925 after the Rifs attacked French Morocco during the Third Rif War. She destroyed coastal defence batteries there despite taking light damage from six hits and remained there until October as the flagship of the French forces. She was refitted again from 16 August 1927 to 15 January 1929 at Toulon and her fire-control systems were comprehensively upgraded. A large cruiser-type fire-control director was added atop the foremast with a 4.57-m coincidence rangefinder and a stereo rangefinder. The rangefinder above the conning tower was replaced by a duplex unit carrying two 4.57-m rangefinders and another 4.57-m rangefinder was added in an armoured hood next to the main mast. Two directors for the secondary guns were added on the navigation bridge, each with a coincidence rangefinder. A rangefinder was added to the roof of 'B' turret, the second one from the bow. Three rangefinders were provided for her anti-aircraft guns, one on top of the duplex unit on the conning tower, one on 'B' turret and one in the aft superstructure. She resumed her role as flagship of the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron of the Mediterranean Squadron until 1 October 1931 when she became a training ship.\n\n\"Paris\" was overhauled again between 1 July 1934 and 21 May 1935. Her boilers were overhauled, her main guns replaced and her Mle 1918 AA guns were exchanged for more modern Mle 1922 guns. They had a maximum depression of 10° and a maximum elevation of 90°. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 8–18 rounds per minute and had a maximum effective ceiling of .\n\n\"Paris\" and \"Courbet\" formed a Fifth Squadron at the beginning of the war. They were transferred to the Atlantic to continue their training duties without interference. Both ships were ordered restored to operational status on 21 May 1940 by Amiral Mord and they were given six Hotchkiss twin machine gun mounts and two single 13.2-mm Browning machine guns at Cherbourg. \"Paris\" was ordered to Le Havre on 6 June to provide gunfire support on the Somme front and covered the evacuation of the town by the Allies, although the lack of spotting aircraft meant that she was not particularly effective in that role. Instead she helped to defend the harbour of Le Havre against German aircraft until she was hit by a bomb on 11 June. She sailed for Cherbourg that night for temporary repairs despite taking on of water per hour. She was transferred to Brest on 14 June and carried 2,800 men when that port was evacuated on 18 June.\n\nIn the wake of the Armistice, \"Paris\" was docked at Plymouth, England. On 3 July 1940, as part of Operation Catapult, British forces forcibly boarded her and she was used by the British as a depot ship and as a barracks ship by the Polish Navy for the rest of the war. On 21 August 1945, after the war had ended, \"Paris\" was towed to Brest where she continued in her role as a depot ship. She was sold for scrap on 21 December 1955 and broken up at La Seyne from June 1956.\n\n"}
{"id": "1889426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889426", "title": "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "text": "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\n\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang is a 2005 American black comedy crime film written and directed by Shane Black (in his directorial debut), and starring Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer, Michelle Monaghan, and Corbin Bernsen. The script is partially based on the Brett Halliday novel \"Bodies Are Where You Find Them\", and interprets the classic hardboiled literary genre in a tongue-in-cheek fashion. The film was produced by Joel Silver, with Susan Levin and Steve Richards as executive producers.\n\nShot in Los Angeles between February 24 and May 3, 2004, the film debuted at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival on May 14, 2005, and was released in the United States on October 21, 2005. It received positive reviews from critics, and grossed $15 million worldwide.\n\nAt a Los Angeles party, Harold \"Harry\" Lockhart recounts recent events. Fleeing a botched burglary in New York City, Harry's friend is shot, forcing Harry to evade police by ducking into an audition. Harry unintentionally impresses Dabney Shaw with an outburst of remorse Dabney mistakes for method acting; Dabney takes Harry to Los Angeles to screen test for the role of a private investigator. At a Hollywood party, Harry meets \"Gay\" Perry van Shrike, an openly gay private investigator, hired to give Harry on-the-job experience for his role. Party host Harlan Dexter is a retired actor who recently resolved a feud over his wife's inheritance with his long-lost daughter, Veronica. Harry also encounters his childhood crush Harmony Lane, but wakes up in bed with her hostile friend.\n\nDuring a stakeout at a Big Bear Lake cabin, Perry and Harry witness a car being dumped in the lake and are spotted by two thugs. Perry realizes there's someone in the trunk and shoots the lock in a rescue attempt, but accidentally hits the female corpse inside. They cannot report the body because it will appear Perry killed her.\n\nHarmony contacts Harry, explaining that her sister Jenna came to Los Angeles, used Harmony's credit cards, then supposedly killed herself. Believing Harry is a detective, Harmony asks him to investigate Jenna's death. After Harmony leaves, Harry discovers the lake corpse in his bathroom. Harry and Perry dump the corpse, later identified as Veronica Dexter by police. Harry discovers it was Harmony's credit card that was used to hire Perry to come to the lake, tying Jenna to their case. He goes to see Harmony, who accidentally slams the door on his finger, cutting it off.\n\nAt a party where Harmony is working, the thugs from the lake (Mr. Frying Pan and Mr. Fire) beat Harry and order him to cease the investigation. While taking Harry to the hospital, Harmony sees the thugs heading to Perry's latest stakeout. Realizing that Perry is heading into a trap, she leaves Harry in her car and runs off to warn Perry, with Frying Pan being killed by an armed food-cart operator. A pink-haired girl, affiliated with the thugs, steals Harmony's car and unwittingly drives an unconscious (on pain-killers) Harry to her house. Mr. Fire arrives and kills her; Harry recovers the gun and kills Mr. Fire.\n\nHarmony meets Harry at his hotel where she reveals she had told Jenna, years ago, that Harlan Dexter was her real father, to hopefully diminish the pain of their sexually abusive father. They end up in bed, but just before anything can happen, Harmony reveals she had once slept with Harry's best friend, and he throws her out.\n\nAfter Harmony disappears following a lead, Harry and Perry investigate a private mental hospital owned by Harlan. Perry realizes Veronica was incarcerated there by Harlan so an impostor could end the inheritance feud. Harry unintentionally kills a murderous orderly, but they are captured by Harlan, who reveals that he plans to cremate his daughter's corpse to remove any remaining evidence. Harry calls Harmony, who had not actually disappeared, but had simply gone to work. Harmony steals the van containing the corpse. Harry and Perry escape, but Harmony crashes the van. A shootout ensues, in which Perry and Harry are shot by the same bullet; Harry then manages to kill Dexter and his three thugs.\n\nWaking in a hospital, Harry finds that Perry survived and Harmony is fine. Perry reveals that Jenna did commit suicide. Jenna had located Harlan, believing him to be her real father. She accidentally witnessed him having sex with Veronica's impostor, Pink Hair Girl. Believing her new \"father\" was also incestuous, Jenna commissioned Perry to catch him in the act, then committed suicide.\n\nPerry travels back to Harmony's hometown and slaps around her father, who is now bed-ridden and helpless, belittling him for being a \"big tough guy\" when he abused the equally helpless Jenna.\n\nHarry finishes his narration by stating that he is wrapping up the movie, now works for Perry, and thanks the viewers for watching.\n\n\nFollowing the bad critical reception of \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\" and a rejection letter from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Shane Black decided he would attempt something out of the action genre. Following the example of James L. Brooks, Black attempted to make a romantic comedy, \"a quirky story of two kids in L.A.\". Brooks liked Black's first draft, but felt his later attempts were losing focus. Trying to salvage what he had liked, Brooks suggested Black to imagine Jack Nicholson from \"As Good as It Gets\" playing Nicholson's role from \"Chinatown\". This led Black to add action elements - \"I said, you know, 'Fuck it. I have to put a murder in it.'\" - and re-work the screenplay, adding the character of detective \"Gay\" Perry, who Black said was an attempt to break stereotypes, as he had never seen \"the gay guy who kicks down the door, shoots everyone, and bails your ass out before\". Old detective novels were a major influence, with Black saying he tried to re-invent the genre \"using realistic characters, in a modern setting, but with the spirit of the 1950s and 1960s\". The crime plot drew from Brett Halliday's \"Bodies Are Where You Find Them\", and Black homaged Raymond Chandler by splitting the film into chapters named after Chandler's books.\n\nThe script, then titled \"You'll Never Die in This Town Again\", was rejected by various studios before Joel Silver, who gave Black his first break producing \"Lethal Weapon\" and \"The Last Boy Scout\", decided to help him. The leading role of the now retitled \"L.A.P.I.\" had been considered for Benicio del Toro, Hugh Grant and Johnny Knoxville. Robert Downey, Jr. learned about the film from his then-girlfriend Susan Levin, who worked as Silver's assistant, and as he finished working with Silver in \"Gothika\", the producer and Black brought him in to audition. Downey was eventually cast as they liked his readings and knew he could fit into the small $15 million budget, as his career had been in a downfall following his time in prison. Levin also suggested to bring in Val Kilmer, who coincidentally had been long interested in making a comedy.\n\nBefore principal photography begun, the title became \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" because Black felt it was a \"blunt and austere title\" that described how the plot was \"half romantic comedy and half murder mystery\". To achieve a neo-noir look, Black screened 1960s films of the genre, such as \"Harper\" and \"Point Blank,\" to cinematographer Michael Barrett and production designer Aaron Osborne. Osborne in particular drew inspiration from the detective book covers by illustrator Robert McGuinness, who was also brought in to draw the covers for the fictional Johnny Gossamer novels that appear in the film. The Hollywood party that opens the film was filmed in Black's own Los Angeles mansion.\n\n\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" was screened out of competition at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. The film's premiere happened at the Chinese Theatre on October 17, as the opener of the Hollywood Film Festival. \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" was released on DVD June 13, 2006.\n\nThe film opened on October 21 in the United States, with a limited release. From its release until mid-November, the film's distribution increased every weekend due to its favorable critical reviews. It stayed in release in the United States until early January. The film earned a total of $4,243,756 in the United States. \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" grossed far more outside the United States, accounting for just over 70% of the film's worldwide gross, accumulating $11,541,392. The film ended up earning $15,785,148 worldwide, earning back its budget. Downey was disappointed at the low box office intake, but said \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" \"ended up being my calling card to \"Iron Man\"\", as his performance attracted director Jon Favreau. That film marked Downey's career resurrection, and Black would even be brought in to co-write and direct the sequel \"Iron Man 3\".\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 85%, based on 179 reviews, and an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Tongue-in-cheek satire blends well with entertaining action and spot-on performances in this dark, eclectic neo-noir homage.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score 72 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nMike Russell of \"The Oregonian\" observed that \"This is one of Downey's most enjoyable performances, and one of Kilmer's funniest. It's a relationship comedy wrapped in sharp talk and gunplay, a triumphant comeback for Black, and one of the year's best movies\". Jeff Otto, an IGN critic, wrote that, \"It takes a bunch of genres and twists them into a blender, a pop relic that still feels current ... one of the best times I've had at the movies this year.\" It was voted \"Overlooked Film of the Year\" by the 2005 Phoenix Film Critics Society on December 20, 2005.\n\nRoger Ebert's review of \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" was a mixed 3 out of 4 stars. He wrote that the film \"contains a lot of comedy and invention, but doesn't much benefit from its clever style. The characters and plot are so promising that maybe Black should have backed off and told the story deadpan, instead of mugging so shamelessly for laughs.\"\n\nThe soundtrack to \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" with music by John Ottman was released on October 18, 2005.\n\n"}

She is also well known for her 1980s work with freestyle music.\n\nStarr was born as Brenda Joy Kaplan to a Jewish American father, organist Harvey Kaplan (also known as Harvey Kaye of the 1960s band the Spiral Starecase) and a Puerto Rican Roman Catholic mother.\n\nIn the early 1980s, through a chance meeting with Harry Belafonte, Starr landed a role in his 1984 hip hop film, \"Beat Street;\" she appeared in it, as herself, as a singer at an open-microphone audition. Starr's appearance in the movie garnered attention, leading to a recording contract on Mirage Records, through Arthur Baker, who enlisted the help of two production teams (Lotti Golden and Richard Scher, and Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers) to complete Starr's debut album, \"I Want Your Love\". The lead single, \"Pickin' Up Pieces\", written by Arthur Baker and Lotti Golden, was a local club sensation and national hit, peaking at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Charts and on the Maxi Singles Chart. \"Pickin' Up Pieces\" also cracked the R&B Hip Hop Billboard Charts.\n\nStarr's eponymous sophomore LP, which she released in 1987 on the MCA Records label before it became part of the present-day Universal Music Group, included what is considered her signature song, the power ballad \"I Still Believe,\" which peaked at No. 13 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming Starr's first and only top 20 single on the Hot 100.

Starr's album also contained the club/dance smash \"What You See is What You Get.\" The album peaked at No. 58 on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart. Starr has had two top 40 hits on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100: \"I Still Believe\" (which peaked at #13) and \"What You See is What You Get\" (which peaked at No. 24 and at No. 6 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play.\n\nTwo of Starr's songs have been included on motion-picture soundtracks; \"Sweet Surrender\" was included in the soundtrack for the 1988 teen film \"License to Drive,\" starring Corey Haim, and \"Sata\" was on the soundtrack for the 1990 film \"Lambada.\" During the late 1980s, Mariah Carey sang background vocals for Starr, and Starr helped Carey secure a recording contract by giving a demo tape of hers to Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola at a party. After being dropped from Sony/Columbia Records for lackluster sales of her third album, \"By Heart,\" Starr worked odd jobs to support herself and her family.\n\nStarr learned Spanish to help rejuvenate her career, successfully reinventing herself as a salsa/tropical and Latin pop artist. After the release of her cover of \"Herida\" (from the Chilean singer Myriam Hernández), which peaked at No. 16 on the Latin Pop Airplay and at No. 1 on the Latin Tropical/Salsa Airplay chart, she continued her success with a string of popular albums and chart hits.\n\nBrenda was also a disc jockey at MIX 102.7, WNEW-FM, where she presented a request program titled \"Under the Stars\" from 9 pm to midnight on Sunday nights before the station changed formats. The lead single from her seventh album, \"Atrevete a Olvidarme,\" titled \"Tu Eres,\" earned her a nomination from the Billboard \"Latin Music Awards\" in 2006.\n\nStarr is married to Chris Petrone, and has a daughter, Gianna Isabella, who made it to the top 10 of \"American Idol\" in its 15th and final season in 2016.\n\n\n\n"}

Although welcomed by some, the message also has been cited as an example of poor usability in computer user interfaces.\n\nIn CP/M, attempting to read a floppy disk drive with the door open would hang until a disk was inserted and the disk drive door was closed (very early disk hardware did not send any kind of signal until a disk was spinning, and a timeout to detect the lack of signal required too much code on these tiny systems). Many users of CP/M became accustomed to this as a method of managing multiple disks, by opening the disk drive to stop a program from reading or writing a file until the correct disk could be inserted.\n\nA primary design consideration for PC DOS was that software written for CP/M be portable to DOS without changes. Even the first IBM PC had hardware that told the operating system that the disk drive door was open, but returning an error to software trying to read the disk would break the ability to manage disks this way without such changes. Still, it was desirable to improve the experience, in particular by giving the user a way to get out of the hang without having to find a disk to insert in the drive. The prompt was invented for this reason.\n\nA missing disk (or disk drive door opened) was defined by DOS as a \"critical error\" and would call the \"critical error handler\". The default \"critical error handler\" was part of COMMAND.COM and printed the \"Abort, Retry, ...\" prompt, then waited for user input. Other problems (in particular, a checksum error while reading data from a disk) were also defined as a \"critical error\", thus causing the prompt to appear for reasons other than a missing disk or opened disk drive. Users could press a key to indicate what they wanted to happen; available options included:\n\n\nA program could install its own \"critical error handler\" while running, and many of the more sophisticated programs (in particular full screen programs) did so in order to avoid the messages disturbing the display. Some programs faked the missing \"Fail\" response in DOS 2.0 by jumping back to the calling program, skipping the return stack in DOS. This was a risky hack as it relied on the stack layout and skipped cleanup operations in the operating system.\n\nThe error messages has been described as being an example of poor user interface design. For most users, if the message appeared, the only choice was to hit 'R'—which repeated the message—or hit another letter, which caused the program to crash and all work to be lost. One scholar described it this way:\n\nHard disks and larger removable media such as Zip drives made the need to manage multiple disks obsolete, and thus made the prompt useless. It was gradually replaced with code that acted like \"Fail\" immediately. DOS 3.3 COMMAND.COM provided the startup option codice_1 in order to force the default critical error handler to return \"Fail\" on all errors. Starting with version 4.0, the alternative command line processors 4DOS and NDOS supported codice_1 and the corresponding codice_3 directive in codice_4/codice_5 as well. The option was also supported by the COMMAND.COM of PTS-DOS 6.51 and S/DOS 1.0, as well as by DR-DOS 7.02 and higher. OpenDOS 7.01, COMMAND.COM provides a similar feature with codice_6 (described as \"do not install a critical error handler\") which is still supported in newer versions. Most other operating systems, such as Linux, always act like \"Fail\" in all cases.\n\nHumorous variations of Edgar Allen Poe's \"The Raven\" using \"Abort, Retry, Ignore?\" in place of \"nevermore\" were written in the 1980s and 1990s and were quite popular, distributed by bulletin board and email. The original and best known version has been credited to Cleveland poet Marcus Bales. It has been adapted numerous times, attributed to Anonymous, Lucy Blades, Rob Collins, and others.\n\nIn 1993, Neil Howe published \"13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?\", a sympathetic book about the culture of Generation X.\n\nIn 1996, White Town released an EP entitled \">Abort, Retry, Fail?_\".\n\n\"PC Magazine\" has used the term as the title of its column highlighting humorous computer-related errors.\n\n"}

{"id": "1889456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889456", "title": "Eresos", "text": "Eresos\n\nEresos (; ; ) and its twin beach village Skala Eresou are located in the southwest part of the Greek island of Lesbos. They are villages visited by considerable number of tourists. Eresos and the village Antissa constitute the municipality Eresos-Antissa.\n\nThe municipality of Eresos–Antissa contains five other villages: Messotopos, Vatoussa, Chidira, Sigri and Pterounda located in the west and most barren part of the island. Bare rocky hills, derived from ancient volcanic activity, dominate the area. Skala Eresou is a centre for international tourism and is a favorite spot of Greek families, young people as well as gay women. With its long beautiful beach with dark volcanic sand and its crystal-clear unpolluted water, Skala Eressou was awarded Blue Flag status by the Foundation for Environmental Education.\n\nStephanus of Byzantium, a lexicographer of the 6th century AD, claimed that the city was named after Eresos, a son of the mythical king of Lesbos, Macar. Archaeology suggests that the city of Eresos was founded in the 8th or 7th century BC. Information about Eresos before the Classical period is extremely scant. The lyric poet Sappho was born at Eresos c. 620 BCE and belonged to an important family who were socially prominent at Mytilene, the island's most important city. In addition, the oldest Greek inscription on the island, which dates to the 6th century BCE, has been found in the hills above Eresos, and is thought to have belonged to a temple. The remains of defensive towers and large enclosures thought to have had a religious purpose built in the decorative Lesbian polygonal style and located at the edges of Eresian territory suggests a certain degree of wealth and prosperity in the Archaic period.\n\nEresos, along with Antissa and Pyrrha, was one of the minor cities on Lesbos in the 5th century BCE. When Mytilene revolted from the Delian League in summer 428, Eresos supported Mytilene. The following year, it fell to the Athenian general Paches and, along with the other cities of the island except for Methymna, had an Athenian cleruchy imposed on it. In the latter part of the Peloponnesian War, Eresos went back and forth between Athenian and Spartan control on a number of occasions. In summer 412, Eresos revolted from Athens and joined the Spartan admiral Astyochus in making an unsuccessful attempt to seize Methymna. When Astyochus' attempt to take Lesbos failed, Eresos returned to Athenian control. The following year, exiles from Methymna again raised Eresos in revolt. The Athenian commanders, Thrasyllus at Methymna and Thrasybulus on Samos, both despatched forces to retake Eresos. This siege was called off when the Athenians realised they had been out-flanked by the Spartan admiral Mindarus. Following the Athenian victory at the Battle of Arginusae in 406, Eresos may have fallen under Athenian control as the rest of the island did. Whatever the case, in 405 the Spartan commander Lysander imposed garrisons and Spartan governors on the cities of Lesbos, which remained in place for the next two decades.\n\nSpartan control of Eresos ended in 389 when the Athenian commander Thrasybulus retook the city. In 377 Eresos is recorded as a member of the Second Athenian League. About 371, Theophrastus, remembered as the \"father of botany\", was born at Eresos; he spent hs entire career at Athens, where he succeeded Aristotle as head of the Peripatetic school. From 377 down to 332, the chronology of Eresian politics is difficult to establish with any certainty. Phaenias of Eresus was also a native of the town. Athens is thought to have lost control of Eresos following the Social War (357–355 BC), after which its power in the Aegean waned. It was perhaps at this point that the tyranny of Apollodorus and his brothers took power. This family and their descendants remained in power until 336, when Attalus and Parmenion campaigned in the region against the Persians at the behest of Philip II of Macedon. It is assumed that a democracy was set up at Eresos and the city enrolled in the League of Corinth. In 335, Memnon of Rhodes retook this region for the Persian Empire and re-installed the tyranny of Apollodorus and his brothers. In spring 334, Alexander the Great invaded Asia Minor, and it is assumed that the cities of Lesbos (including Eresos) went over to the Macedonian forces soon after his victory at the Battle of the Granicus in May 334; again, the tyrants will have been expelled and the Eresian democrats re-installed. In 333, the admiral Memnon of Rhodes again attacked the island of Lesbos: he seized all the cities except for Mytilene and installed a new pair of tyrants at Eresos, Eurysilaus and Agonippus. A long inscription later set up at Eresos c. 306-301 by the Eresian democrats claims (not without partisan intent) that the tyrants committed many crimes, including expelling the men from the city, holding their women hostage on the acropolis, and exacting large sums of money from the populace, as well as helping the Persians commit piracy against Greek shipping.\n\nIn 332, Alexander's admiral Hegelochus of Macedon retook Lesbos from the Persians once and for all and brought Eurysilaus and Agonippus to be tried before Alexander in Egypt, where he left their fate in the hands of the newly restored Eresian democracy. The same long inscription which records the alleged crimes of the tyrants also details their trial which ended in their execution. Biographical traditions of the philosophers Theophrastus and Phaenias of Eresos claims that they were involved in the overthrow of tyranny at Eresos. Efforts were made by the exiled relatives of Apollodorus and his brothers to return to Eresos in 324 and 319 and by the exiled relatives of Agonippus and Eurysilaus to return c. 306-301, but on all three occasions the Eresian democracy was successfully able to argue that they should not be obliged to take back their exiles.\n\nThe history of Eresos after the Classical period is only known from its inscriptions, as almost no mention is made of it in the literary sources which survive. In the last two decades of the 4th century BCE Eresos had been subject to Antigonus I Monophthalmus. After Antigonus' defeat at the Battle of Ipsus in 301, the region of north west Asia Minor and the adjacent islands went over to King Lysimachus until his death at the Battle of Corupedium in 281. In the following decades, the cities of Lesbos with the exception of Mytilene drifted into the Ptolemaic sphere of influence. Ptolemaic influence at Eresos in the second half of the 3rd century BCE is indicated by the creation of a religious festival in honour of the Ptolemaic royal family called the Ptolemaia at which gymnastic competitions were held.\n\nPolitical infighting at the Ptolemaic court following the accession of Ptolemy V Epiphanes in 205 and the campaigns of Antiochus III in the years following led to the disintegration of Ptolemaic influence in the north Aegean. The power vacuum was filled by Rhodes, which soon after agreed a treaty of alliance with Eresos and the other cities of Lesbos. In the first half of the 2nd century BCE, Eresos also drew closer to the other cities of Lesbos under the aegis of the Lesbian \"koinon\", a quasi-federal organisation which had existed on the island in various forms since the early 6th century BCE, but became more active in times when a common danger was perceived. This period of Eresian history also saw closer ties with Rome, at this time an emerging power in the Eastern Mediterranean. Two Romans are honoured in a list of \"proxenoi\" from Eresos dating to the last third of the 3rd century BCE, one of the earliest appearances of \"negotiatores\" in the Greek East. An inscription recording a letter sent to Eresos by a Roman magistrate and another document honouring the Romans as benefactors of the Greeks, both of which date to the 2nd century BCE, indicate that Eresos, much like the other cities on Lesbos, sought to forge closer ties with Rome. The complete destruction of neighbouring Antissa in 167 will have been a further encouragement to do so.\n\nIt is unclear what role Eresos played in the Mithridatic Wars against Rome (88-63 BCE) and whether, like Mytilene, it subsequently suffered for its anti-Roman stance following victory over Mithridates VI of Pontus. However, by the reign of Augustus the elites of Eresos had become fiercely pro-Roman. There were cults to the Emperor Augustus, his wife Livia, and his heirs Lucius and Gaius Caesar, and the people of Eresos further honoured Gaius Caesar and Claudius Nero, later the Emperor Tiberius, by electing them honorary \"prytanis\" in certain years, the most important magistracy at Eresos. Prominent Eresian aristocrats won Roman citizenship for their descendants by participating in the Imperial cult, dedicating altars and temples to the Imperial family, and arranging festivals in their honour. A fragmentary inscription indicates that Eresos successfully petitioned Augustus in 12 BCE on an unknown matter, while in c. 7-4 BCE Publius Quinctilius Varus, the Roman senator and friend of Augustus later defeated at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 CE, may have visited Eresos on his way to Syria and conferred Roman citizenship on one of the city's prominent families. In addition, numerous funerary epitaphs and other monuments indicate the existence of a permanently resident Roman population form the 1st century BCE onwards.\n\nThe only sport club based in Eresos is a football team whose name is AO Papanikolís (Greek: Αθλητικός Όμιλος Παπανικολής), founded in 1979 and currently playing in one of local football championships of Greece, lowest leagues of Greek football. Its name was taken in honor of admiral Dimitrios Papanikolis and its main colors are red and blue.\n\nEresos is the setting of Lawrence Durrell's \"Sappho: a Play in Verse\" (1950), set in the Archaic period; Durrell invents an episode in which an earthquake causes a large part of the city to be submerged beneath the sea.\n\nEresos makes a brief appearance in the novel \"Sure of You\", the sixth volume in the series \"Tales of the City\" by Armistead Maupin. In the chapter entitled \"The Third Whale\", Skala Eressou is described as a seaside town with concrete buildings and a beach of coarse grey sand. Some places in the town are described. These include the shop on the square where Mona found the key rings inscribed with the name \"Sappho\", the hotel called \"Sappho the Eressian\" where Mona stays in a spare, clean room with a single bed and a lone lamp, the big grey bluff at the end of the beach where more nude bathers were gathered, and the famous tents put up by the women who were part of Sappho's tribe.\n\n\n"}

Widely viewed as teen idols, the band headlined the Saturday nights of the Los Angeles Street Scene Festival in both 1985 and 1986, with audiences of 150,000 in attendance. They released four albums, \"Rock n' Roll Crazy\", \"Renegade II – On the Run\", \"Nuns on Wheels\" and \"Renegade Live\", with their major success coming in California, Mexico and Japan. Renegade played around the world and at music festivals with bands such as 38 Special, Foreigner, Journey and Night Ranger, and in the late 1980s were asked by Kenny Rogers to appear on the Texas-New Mexico Border with Lionel Richie and Lee Greenwood to support Rogers' Hands Across America effort. In 1990, the band was featured in a 98-minute television special aired on MTV internationally, entitled \"Renegade MTV Special\".\n\nRenegade reformed in 2000 and was honored in August 2001 at a David Hasselhoff-hosted event at the Conga Room in Los Angeles for record sales in excess of 30 million units worldwide.\n\nIn 1986 Cardenas held the world record for having the world's largest drumkit, which he demonstrated on the \"Guinness Hall of Fame Awards\" TV show hosted by David Frost.\n\nThe same year Cardenas released a solo album entitled \"Animal Instinct\".

It won a nomination for Best Music Video, Short Form at the 29th Annual Grammy Awards. Cardenas followed \"Runaway\" with the self-penned \"Hungry for Your Love\", which featured Phyllis Diller and Cardenas's pet tiger Bundi in the video, but the single did not match the success of \"Runaway\". The album \"Animal Instinct\" was reissued on March 6, 2012, featuring bonus tracks and the videos for the singles.\n\nThe re-release of \"Animal Instinct\" was due to precede the release of a new double album by Cardenas entitled \"Generations\" that was to include Cardenas's two sons Nick and Zach Cardenas and was planned for release later in 2012.

It is \"de facto\" independent from the rest of the country, and is governed by the United Wa State Party as a one-party socialist state. However, Wa State recognises Myanmar's sovereignty over all of its territory, and has, in return, been granted a high level of autonomy by the central government. Under the 2008 Constitution of Myanmar the area is designated as the Wa Self-Administered Division of Shan State. The administrative capital is Pangkham, formerly known as Panghsang. The name \"Wa\" is derived from the Wa ethnic group, who speak an Austroasiatic language.\n\nWa State is divided into northern and southern regions which are separated from one another, with the southern region bordering Thailand and consisting of 200,000 people. The total area of the region controlled by Wa State is . The political leaders of Wa State are mostly ethnic Wa people. The Wa State government emulates many political features of the government of the People's Republic of China, having a central committee and a central party known as the United Wa State Party. Whilst Wa State is highly autonomous from the control of the central government in Naypyidaw, their relationship is based on peaceful coexistence and Wa State recognises the sovereignty of the central government over all of Myanmar.\n\nThe working language of the Wa State government is Mandarin Chinese. Southwest Mandarin and Wa are widely spoken by the population, with the language of education being Standard Chinese. Television broadcasts within Wa State are broadcast in both Mandarin and Wa. Commodities within Wa State are brought over from China, and the renminbi is commonly used for exchanges. China Mobile has cellular coverage over some parts of Wa State.\n\nFor a long time, headman tribes were dispersed around the Wa mountainous area, with no unified governance. During the Qing dynasty, the region became separated from the tribal military control of the Dai people. British rule in Burma did not administer the Wa States and the border with China was left undefined.\n\nFrom the late 1940s, during the Chinese Civil War, remnants of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army retreated to territory within Burma as the communists took over mainland China. Within the mountain region Kuomintang forces of the held their position for two decades in preparation for a counterattack towards mainland China. Under pressure from the United Nations, the counterattack was cancelled and the army was recalled to northern Thailand and later back to Taiwan; however, some troops decided to remain within Burma. East of the Salween river, indigenous tribal guerrilla groups exercised control with the support of the Communist Party of Burma.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Communist Party of Burma lost its base of operations within central Burma, and with the assistance of the Chinese communists, expanded within the border regions in the northeast. Many intellectual youths from China joined the Communist Party of Burma, and these forces also absorbed many local guerrillas. The Burmese communists gained control over Pangkham, which became their base of operations.\n\nAt the end of the 1980s, the ethnic minorities of northeast Burma became politically separated from the Communist Party of Burma. On 17 April 1989, Bao Youxiang's armed forces announced their separation from the Communist Party of Burma, and formed the United Myanmar Ethnicities Party, which later became the United Wa State Party. On 18 May, the United Wa State Army signed a ceasefire agreement with the State Law and Order Restoration Council, which replaced Ne Win's military regime following the 8888 Uprising.\n\nTensions between the central government and Wa state were heightened in 2009. During this time, peace initiative proposals by Wa State were rejected by the Myanmar government. The government warned on 27 April 2010 that the WHP program could push Myanmar and Wa State into further conflict.\n\nWa State comprises seven districts (townships) of what the Myanmar government officially deems as the Shan State. Internally, Wa State administers 15 districts within its territory.\nWa State's southern exclave is not part of traditional Wa territory, but was granted in 1989 by the then-ruling Burmese military junta for the UWSA's cooperation in their efforts against drug warlord Khun Sa. These territories were originally inhabited by the Austroasiatic Tai Loi peoples, but now include significant Lahu and Shan communities.\n\nThe region is mainly mountainous, with deep valleys. The lowest points are approximately 600 metres above sea level, with the highest mountains over 3000 metres. Initially Wa State was heavily reliant on opium production. With Chinese assistance, there has been a move towards growing rubber and tea plantations. Wa State cultivates 220,000 acres of rubber. Due to the resettlement of residents from mountainous areas to fertile valleys, there is also cultivation of wet rice, corn and vegetables. Dozens died during the resettlement due to disease and road accidents. Wa State is economically dependent on China, which supports it financially and provides military and civilian advisors and weapons. It shares 82 miles (133 km) of frontier with China.\n\nThe United Wa State Army (UWSA) was previously the largest narcotics trafficking organization in Southeast Asia. The UWSA cultivated vast areas of land for the opium poppy, which was later refined to heroin. Methamphetamine trafficking was also important to the economy of Wa State. The money from the opium was primarily used for purchasing weapons.\n\nIn August 1990, government officials began drafting a plan to end drug production and trafficking in Wa State. According to an interview with Wa officials in 1994, Bao Youyi (Tax Kuad Rang; also known as Bao Youyu) became wanted by the Chinese police for his involvement in drug trafficking. As a result, Bao Youxiang and Zhao Nyi-Lai went to Cangyuan Va Autonomous County of China and signed the Cangyuan Agreement with local officials, which stated that, \"No drugs will go into the international society (from Wa State); no drugs will go into China (from Wa State); no drugs will go into Burmese government-controlled areas (from Wa State).\" However, the agreement did not mention whether or not Wa State could sell drugs to insurgent groups.\n\nIn 1997, the United Wa State Party officially proclaimed that Wa State would be drug-free by the end of 2005. With the help of the United Nations and the Chinese government, many opium farmers in Wa State shifted to the production of rubber and tea. However, some poppy farmers continued to cultivate the flower outside of Wa State.\n\nAlthough the Burmese government has begun taking measures to decrease the production of such drugs, it is an arduous task due to corruption at high levels in the government and a lack of infrastructure to carry out operations. In 2005, Wa State was declared by the UWSP a \"drug-free zone\" and the cultivation of opium was made illegal.\n\nA BBC presentation aired on 19 November 2016 showed the burning of methamphetamine, as well as a thriving trade in illegal animal parts.\n\n\n\n"}

Sometimes a sunshower is created when a single rain shower cloud passes overhead, and the Sun's angle keeps the sunlight from being obstructed by overhead clouds.\n\nSunshower conditions often lead to the appearance of a rainbow, if the sun is at a sufficiently low angle.

The resident engineer was M. Davidson who also acted as resident engineer on a number of Telford's other works. The foundation stone was laid on 17 June 1796 and it was completed in 1801. It has a cast iron trough within which the water is contained. The masonry walls hide the cast iron interior. The aqueduct followed Telford's innovative Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct on the Shrewsbury Canal, and was a forerunner of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, also on the Llangollen Canal. The aqueduct was briefly the tallest navigable one ever built, and it now is Grade II* listed in both England and Wales. It forms part of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct World Heritage Site.\n\nThe aqueduct consists of ten arches, each with a span of . The water level is above the ground and above the River Ceiriog.

Founded in about 1030 by Arabic-speaking Berbers, the Banu Ifran, it later became a haven for pirates in the 17th century as an independent republic before being incorporated into Alaouite Morocco.\n\nThe city's name is sometimes transliterated as Salli or Sallee. The National Route 6 connects it to Fez and Meknes in the east and the N1 to Kénitra in the north-east. It recorded a population of 890,403 in the 2014 Moroccan census.\n\nThe Phoenicians established a settlement called Sala, later the site of a Roman colony, Sala Colonia, on the south side of the Bou Regreg estuary. \n\nIt is sometimes confused with Salé, on the opposite north bank. Salé was founded in about 1030 by Arabic-speaking Berbers who apparently cultivated the legend that the name was derived from that of Salah, son of Ham, son of Noah.\n\nThe Banu Ifran Berber dynasty began construction of a mosque about the time the city was founded. The present-day Great Mosque of Salé was built during the 12th-century reign of the Almohad sultan Abu Yaqub Yusuf, although not completed until 1196. During the 17th century, Rabat was known as New Salé, or \"Salé la neuve\" (in French), as it expanded beyond the ancient city walls to include the Chellah, which had become a fortified royal necropolis under the rule of Abu Yaqub Yusuf's son, Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur.\n\nIn September 1260, Salé was raided and occupied by warriors sent in a fleet of ships by King Alfonso X of Castile. After the victory of the Marinid dynasty, the historic Bab el-Mrissa was constructed by the Sultan Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd Al-Haqq which remains as a landmark of the city.\n\nIn the 17th century, Salé became a haven for Barbary pirates, among them Moriscos turned corsair, who formed an independent Republic of Salé. Salé pirates (the well-known \"Salé Rovers\") roamed the seas, and cruised the shipping routes between Atlantic colonial ports and Europe, seizing ships from the Americas and Europe for goods and captives. They sold their crews and sometimes passengers into slavery in the Arabic world. Despite the legendary reputation of the Salé corsairs, their ships were based across the river in Rabat, called \"New Salé\" by the English.\n\nThe European powers took action to try to subdue the threat from the Barbary Coast. On 20 July 1629, the city of Salé was bombarded by French Admiral Isaac de Razilly with a fleet composed of the ships \"Licorne\", \"Saint-Louis\", \"Griffon\", \"Catherine\", \"Hambourg\", \"Sainte-Anne\", \"Saint-Jean\"; his forces destroyed three corsair ships.\n\nDuring the decades preceding the independence of Morocco, Salé was the stronghold of some \"national movement\" activists. The reading of the \"Latif\" (a politically charged prayer to God, read in mosques in loud unison) was launched in Salé and became popular in some cities of Morocco.\n\nIn 1851, Salé was bombarded in retaliation for piracy being practiced by Moroccan ships against European traders.\n\nA petition against the so-called \"Berber Dahir\" (a decree that allowed some Berber-speaking areas of Morocco to continue using Berber Law, as opposed to Sharia Law) was given to Sultan Mohamed V and the Resident General of France. The petition and the \"Latif\" prayer led to the withdrawal and adjustment of the so-called \"Berber Decree\" of May 1930. The activists who opposed the \"Berber Decree\" apparently feared that the explicit recognition of the Berber Customary Law (a very secular-minded Berber tradition) would threaten the position of Islam and its Sharia law system. Others believed that opposing the French-engineered \"Berber Decree\" was a means to turn the table against the French occupation of Morocco.\n\nThe widespread storm that was created by the \"Berber Dahir\" controversy created a somewhat popular Moroccan nationalist elite based in Salé and Fez; it had strong anti-Berber, anti-West, anti-secular, and pro Arab-Islamic inclinations. This period helped develop the political awareness and activism that would lead fourteen years later to the signing of the Manifest of Independence of Morocco on 11 January 1944 by many \"Slawi\" activists and leaders. Salé has been deemed to have been the stronghold of the Moroccan left for many decades, where many leaders have resided.\n\nSalé has played a rich and important part in Moroccan history. The first demonstrations for independence against the French, for example, began in Salé. Numerous government officials, decision makers, and royal advisers of Morocco have been from Salé. Salé people, the Slawis, have always had a \"tribal\" sense of belonging, a sense of pride that developed into a feeling of superiority towards the \"\"berranis\"\", i.e. Outsiders.\n\nThe prefecture is divided administratively into the following:\n\nSalé features a Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\") with warm to hot dry summers and mild damp winters. Located along the Atlantic Ocean, Salé has a mild, temperate climate, shifting from cool in winter to warm days in the summer months. The nights are always cool (or cold in winter, it can reach Sub sometimes), with daytime temperatures generally rising about +7/8 C° (+15/18 F°). The winter highs typically reach only in December–February. Summer daytime highs usually hover around , but may occasionally exceed , especially during heat waves. Summer nights are usually pleasant and cool, ranging between and and rarely exceeding . Rabat belongs to the sub-humid bioclimatic zone with an average annual precipitation of 560 mm.\n\nSalé's climate resembles the southwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula and the coast of SoCal.\n\nRecent developments, including the new bridge connecting to Rabat, the new Rabat-Salé tramway, marina and coastal development demonstrate government investment. Private development companies such as Emaar Properties are also investing in the area.\nHigh unemployment used to be a serious issue to the Salé area, with the numerous textile factories located in this area being the only real source of work, this is recently diversing into other areas such as international call centres, electronics and recently a new \"techno park\" was opened, which was modeled on the Casablanca techno centre success.\n\nWater supply and wastewater collection in Salé was irregular, with poorer and illegal housing units suffering the highest costs and most acute scarcities. Much of the city used to rely upon communal standpipes, which were often shut down, depriving some neighbourhoods of safe drinking water for indefinite periods of time. Nevertheless, Salé fared better than inland Moroccan locations, where water scarcity was even more acute. Improvements from the government, local businesses and the water distribution companies of \"Regie de distribution d'Eau & d'Electricite de Rabat-Salé\" (REDAL) have meant that this situation has improved drastically.\n\nIn December 2017, AS Salé became Africa's basketball club Champion. It was the first continental crown in the club's history.\n\nThe A.S.S. is the football club of the city, and the president is Abderrahmane Chokri.\n\nSalé's main airport is Rabat–Salé Airport , it's located in Salé also serving Rabat the capital city of Morocco\n\nSalé is served by two principal railway stations run by the national rail service, the ONCF. These stations are Salé-Tabriquet and Salé-City.\n\nSalé-Ville is the main inter-city station, from which trains run south to Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakech and El Jadida, north to Tanger, or east to Meknes, Fes, Taza and Oujda.\n\nThe Rabat-Salé tramway is a tram system which was put into service on May 23, 2011 in the Moroccan cities of Rabat and Salé. The network has two lines for a total length of and 31 stops. It is operated by Veolia Transdev with Alstom Citadis trams.\n\nThe film \"Black Hawk Down\" was partially filmed in Salé, in particular the wide angle aerial shots with helicopters flying down the coastline.\n\nThe character Robinson Crusoe, in Daniel Defoe's novel by the same name, spends time in captivity of the local pirates, the Salé Rovers, and at last sails off to liberty from the mouth of the Salé river.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1889558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889558", "title": "Nok culture", "text": "Nok culture\n\nThe Nok culture is an early Iron Age population whose material remains are named after the Ham village of Nok in Kaduna State of Nigeria, where their terracotta sculptures were first discovered in 1928. The Nok Culture appeared in northern Nigeria around 1500 BC and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 AD, having lasted approximately 2,000 years.\n\nIron use, in smelting and forging tools, appears in Nok culture by at least 550 BC and possibly a few centuries earlier. Data from historical linguistics suggest that iron smelting was independently discovered in the region by 1000 BC. Scientific field work began in 2005 to systematically investigate Nok archaeological sites, and to better understand Nok terracotta sculptures within their Iron Age archaeological context.\n\nBreunig and Rupp hypothesized, \"Their origin is unknown, but since the plants they used as crops (especially millet) are indigenous to the Sahel region, a northern homeland is more probable than any other.\" Breunig explains: \"The people of the Nok Culture must have come from somewhere else. So far, however, we have not found out what region, though we suspect the Sahel zone in West Africa.\"\n\nThe function of Nok terracotta sculptures is still unknown. For the most part, the terracotta is preserved in the form of scattered fragments. That is why Nok art is well known today only for the heads, both male and female, whose hairstyles are particularly detailed and refined. The statues are in fragments because the discoveries are usually made from alluvial mud, in terrain made by the erosion of water. The terracotta statues found there are hidden, rolled, polished, and broken. Rarely are works of great size conserved intact making them highly valued on the international art market.\n\nThe terracotta figures are hollow, coil built, nearly life sized human heads and bodies that are depicted with highly stylized features, abundant jewelry, and varied postures.\n\nLittle is known of the original function of the pieces, but theories include ancestor portrayal, grave markers, and charms to prevent crop failure, infertility, and illness. Also, based on the dome-shaped bases found on several figures, they could have been used as finials for the roofs of ancient structures.\n\nMargaret Young-Sanchez, Associate Curator of Art of the Americas, Africa, and Oceania in The Cleveland Museum of Art, explains that most Nok ceramics were shaped by hand from coarse-grained clay and subtractively sculpted in a manner that suggests an influence from wood carving. After some drying, the sculptures were covered with slip and burnished to produce a smooth, glossy surface. The figures are hollow, with several openings to facilitate thorough drying and firing. The firing process most likely resembled that used today in Nigeria, in which the pieces are covered with grass, twigs, and leaves and burned for several hours.\n\nAs a result of natural erosion and deposition, Nok terracottas were scattered at various depths throughout the Sahel grasslands, causing difficulty in the dating and classification of the mysterious artifacts. Luckily, two archaeological sites, Samun Dukiya and Taruga, were found containing Nok art that had remained unmoved. Radiocarbon and thermo-luminescence tests dated the sculptures to a range of dates between about 2,900 and 2,000 years ago, making them some of the oldest in Western Africa. Many further dates were retrieved in the course of new archaeological excavations, extending the beginnings of the Nok tradition even further back in time.\n\nBecause of the similarities between the two sites, archaeologist Graham Connah believes that \"Nok artwork represents a style that was adopted by a range of iron-using farming societies of varying cultures, rather than being the diagnostic feature of a particular human group as has often been claimed.\"\n\nThe first Nok terracotta was discovered in 1928 by Colonel Dent Young, a co-owner of a mining partnership, near the village of Nok in Kaduna State, Nigeria. The terracotta was accidentally unearthed at a level of 24 feet from an alluvial tin mine. Young presented the sculptures to the museum of the Department of Mines in Jos.\n\nFifteen years later, in 1943 near the village of Nok, in the center of Nigeria, a new series of clay figurines were discovered by accident while mining tin. A clerk in charge of the mine had found a head and had taken it back to his home for use as a scarecrow, a role that it filled (successfully) for a year in a yam field. This scarecrow was eventually noticed by Bernard Fagg who at the time was an administrative officer who had studied archaeology at the University of Cambridge. Fagg noticed that the head on the scarecrow looked similar to the sculpture that Young had found. He traveled to Jos where Young showed Fagg other recently uncovered terracotta figures. Eventually it became clear that the tin mining in Nok and Jema'a areas were revealing and destroying archaeological material.\n\nPreliminary excavations at the beginning of January 1961 began near a remote valley named Taruga near the village of Takushara. The trial excavations took place during a period of eight days. The finds included objects of wrought iron, a quantity of iron slag, fragments of tuyere, pottery, figurine fragments, red ocher, quartz hammer-stones, and small concentrations of charcoal. The most famous finds at the site were the pottery graters which were shallow, flat-bottomed dishes which were deeply scored inside with diced patterns to produce a sharp abrasive surface. These pottery graters were probably used for food preparation. In the preliminary excavation a proton magnetometer survey was used to try and locate furnaces. The survey revealed a total of 61 magnetic anomalies which were mostly located in a flat, central area which probably indicated the limits of actual occupation. Twenty of the anomalies revealed concentrations of slag and nine of them contained in situ structures of furnace walls and bases. The most common type of artefact found was domestic pottery which can be divided into two different types. One type are bowls or shallow basins without lips and the other are globular pots which have averted lips. Because of this preliminary excavation, the Nok Culture would start being regarded as belonging to the Iron Age.\n\nIn 1989, German scientists were working in northeastern Nigeria's Chad Basin as part of a cooperative project between the University of Maiduguri located in Borno State, Nigeria, and archaeologists of Goethe University Frankfurt. This project examined the beginnings of sedentary farming societies in the Chad Basin. Questions arose about whether there were other societies like those in the Chad Basin, and these questions led the team to investigate the Nok Culture. In the early steps of the Frankfurt Nok Project, researchers had difficulty finding sites to excavate. The team began collaborating with Umaru Yusuf Potiskum and they started finding distinct Nok culture sites, although most were looted. A few sites, however, were still intact, and artefacts found at these sites are described below.\n\nThe shapes of stone tools found at Nok sites change little throughout the entire span of the Nok Culture. What tends to strike researchers is a lack of cutting tools. Apart from stone axes, no tools with a cutting edge have been found. Projectile points made of either iron or stone are also absent from Nok sites.\n\nGrinding tools are very common at Nok sites. They are rarely preserved in one piece, but can still illustrate the different shapes and sizes of tools used throughout the Nok Culture. Grinding stones were made of quartzite, granitic, or metamorphic rock. At the site of Ungwar Kura, grinding stones seem to have been placed in a certain order, and at the site of Ido huge grinding slabs were arranged in an upright position with pots and stone beads next to them. This context is assumed to have been ritual in some way. Most of the grinders are merely hand-sized. Throughout Nok sites, there is an abundance of grinding slabs but there seems to be a low number of hand stones. It is possible that members of the Nok Culture used these grinders until they reached a certain state of wear, and then repurposed them as pestles.\n\nGround stone axes were another tool commonly used by the Nok. They were typically made from fine-grained volcanic rock (siliceous rock is also sometimes seen), and may have been used in food preparation. These ax blades tend to be smallish in size, the largest reaching 20 centimeters. Stone balls are found at almost every Nok site and are approximately palm-sized. They were probably used as hammerstones or for roughening the surface of a grinding stone. Not all of them are ball shaped, however, and many have chipping marks all over or at least in one place. These stone balls likely would have served as mobile grinding stones.\n\nStone rings have also been found at Nok Culture sites. They are normally found as fragments, but can be identified as rings because of their flat, oval or triangular cross-sections and their shapes. These stone rings are very rare and their purpose is unknown. Another rare find is stone beads, which are typically found as if strung on strings. Beads tend to be carefully made out of hard siliceous rock such as quartz, chalcedony, jasper, or carnelian. There are three different bead shapes: cylindrical, which is the most common shape, as well as rod and ring-shaped.\n\nPotsherds (pottery shards) are the most abundant archaeological artefacts at Nok sites. Since 2009, excavated pottery has been undergoing systematic analysis with a central aim to try and establish a chronology. Certain attributes of the pottery such as decoration, shape and size appear with an increasing frequency and then disappear, being replaced with different pottery attributes. This change can sometimes allow one to divide the progression into different intervals based on the different attributes. In total approximately 90,000 potsherds have been collected, of which 15,000 have been considered diagnostic, meaning that they are decorated, sherds from the rim or the bottom of the vessel, or they have handles or holes in them. The results of the pottery analysis can be delineated into three distinct time periods: Early, Middle, and Late.\n\nFrom approximately c. 1500–900 BC the pottery of the Early Nok Period are mostly small and not very well preserved. They seem to be richly decorated with various elaborate patterns directly below the vessels' rims and covering a large part of the ceramic body. The lines made on the pottery seem to be remarkably fine or curving lines. There tend to be many lines which are close together and some even have criss-crossing lines beneath the rim. Pottery frequently had everted and broad, thick rims.\n\nThe Middle Nok Period is approximately from c. 900–300 BC and in this time period there is a dramatic increase of sites, terracotta fragments and iron objects. Instead of the early period's decoration, which tended to cover most of the pot, instead there is a decorative band which is bordered by deep horizontal lines. This band appears on the pots' upper half or directly under the rim of the bowls. Some bands have a sharp ends as well as impressed zigzag lines or an incised wave or arc. Unlike the Early Nok period the Middle Nok ceramics tend to have more variety in the rim with everted rims, open bowls, bowls with inverted rims and incised line ornaments on the rims' lips.\n\nThe Late Nok period is from approximately c. 300–1 BC and has only a few known sites. There is little pottery available for analysis but from the pottery that was found there is a decrease in the strictness of the ornamental band. While bands are still used, they are more complexly decorated with additional patterning. There also tends to be a returning pattern of body decoration. The variety of rim sizes and types seem to be increasing even more than in the Middle Nok period.\n\nAt almost all Nok sites, there are charred plant remains consisting of firewood and plant material for cooking. Remains of pearl millet, one of Africa's oldest grain crops, are commonly found. Pearl millet is highly productive and resistant to adverse growing conditions, including drought. Cowpeas, valued for their high protein content, are also found at some sites. So far, pearl millet and cowpeas are the only crops known to have been cultivated by the Nok people. It is unclear whether they ate or farmed tubers of any kind. The numerous grinding stones found at Nok sites suggest that the grains were ground into flour and made into a type of porridge.\n\nHard pits from wild fruits have been found at many Nok sites. At some sites, fruit and seeds of other wild plants such as grasses and legumes were discovered. Overall there is not a huge selection of plant remains, but this could simply mean they were not preserved.\n\nThe Nok people probably used an agroforestry system, combining cultivated crops with useful trees on the same plot of land. These plots are ecologically sustainable and inter-cropping of trees and several cultivated plant species were common from the savannas to the rain forest, with the origins of the practice going back to the first millennium BC, right at the time of the Nok culture. Most West African trees are not domesticated but are part of the wild vegetation which is left after farmers clear their fields of their crops. Because they are left to grow they multiply naturally without needing to be planted. Trees can produce food, medicine and animal feed.\n\nBecause of the acidic soil, no animal bones from the Nok culture have been preserved, leaving no direct evidence of what species they might have domesticated (or hunted). The only evidence for animals during the Nok culture period is the depictions of animals as figurines or terracotta sculptures.\n\nSince the 1970s, Nok terracotta figures have been heavily looted. Even larger-scale looting commenced in the Nok cultural area in 1994, and by 1995 two main local traders emerged. Each of the main traders could employ approximately 1,000 diggers to unearth terracottas every day. Although the majority of the terracottas were fragmented, some were intact and sellable. Because of this, hundreds of Nok Culture sites have been illegally dug in search of these terracotta sculptures. Valuable information about the Nok Culture is lost when these objects are taken from out of the ground and removed from their archaeological contexts.\n\nIn 1979, Nigeria's National Commission of Museums and Monuments Decree established the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM), which is used to manage Nigeria's cultural heritage. NCMM Decree number 77 made it illegal for anyone other than authorized personnel to buy or sell antiquities within Nigeria or export an antiquity without a permit from the NCMM. Towards the end of the 1990s the federal government of Nigeria implemented the NCMM, which initiated a series of actions to work out strategies for combating the problems of looting and to map out a plan of action. The general consensus was that laws governing antiquities and penalties for offenders needed to be strictly enforced and that all archaeological sites should be monitored. The NCMM also recommended more aggressive public enlightenment campaigns as well as a series of sensitization programs across the nation. These programs are considered a success in terms of increased awareness by law enforcement agents, as well as the Nigerian customs authorities and Interpol. However, not all of the recommendations were implemented, because the Nigerian government did not have the resources to face the large scale of some of the challenges. For example, the government did not have the resources to place monitors at all archaeological sites, and terracotta figures still slip through Nigeria's borders.\n\nToday, the terracotta sculptures are very highly sought after on the international art market, and so artifacts continue to be dug up without documentation of the contexts in which they were buried. A lack of extensive archaeological study has also severely limited our understanding of the Nok cultures. A joint research project with Goethe University and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments conducted since 2005 showed that more than 90% of Nok Culture sites known in the research area have been illegally looted. Art historical studies carried out shows that over 1,000 Nok terracotta sculptures have been illegally excavated and smuggled into Europe, the USA, Japan, and elsewhere. In February 2013, Daily Trust reported that the Nigerian Ministry of Tourism, Culture, and National Orientation repossessed five Nok statuettes looted by a French thief in August 2010. The pieces had been seized by French customs agents and were repatriated following a Nigerian Government Directive. What further complicates the problem are the many workshops which fake Nok sculptures and then put them on the market as authentic.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1889563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889563", "title": "Hizbul Mujahideen", "text": "Hizbul Mujahideen\n\nHizb-ul-Mujahideen (, \"Ḥizb al-Mujāhidīn\", meaning \"Party of Holy Warriors\" or \"Party of \"Mujahideen\"\", abbreviated as HuM or HM) is a separatist militant group active in the region of Jammu and Kashmir that seeks for its integration with Pakistan. The group has been designated as a terrorist group by the European Union, India, and the United States. It remains a lawful organisation in Pakistan.\n\nFounded by Muhammad Ahsan Dar in September 1989, it is considered one of the most important players that evolved the narrative of the Kashmir conflict from nationalism to the religious lines of radical jihad. The outfit is said to be supported, since its inception, by the Pakistani Intelligence agency, ISI. Some authors view it as the military wing of Jamaat-e-Islami. Its headquarters are located at Muzaffarabad in Pakistan administered Kashmir and a liaison office is maintained at Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan.\n\nIn 1988, Muhammad Ahsan Dar, a Jamaat-e-Islami school teacher, chose to cross the Line of Control to Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Trained in Pakistan, he returned to Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir to establish a hard-line struggle against the Indian administration. He was joined by Mohammed Abdullah Bangroo, another Jamaat militant veteran, in the role of military advisor and in around April 1990, the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen was established.\n\nBy 1990, the organisation asserted a strength over 10,000 armed cadres, most of whom were trained across the border. Many were trained in Afghanistan, too. Heavily critical of all other actors who accepted independence as a third option in the Kashmir conflict, the group solely advocated for an outright integration of Kashmir with Pakistan. Paul Staniland notes that the organisation primarily mobilised through the Jamaat-e-Islami network but initially represented a minority politico-religious ideology of theirs'.\n\nThe organisation's first major strike is deemed to be the assassination of Maulvi Farooq, the then Mirwaiz of Kashmir and chairman of the All Jammu and Kashmir Awami Action Committee, a coalition of disparate political parties in Jammu and Kashmir, on 21 May 1990. 21 people were killed in the clashes that ensued. The group gradually sought for a greater control of the socio-economic sphere of Kashmir and in June 1990 asked farmers to abstain from exporting their produce through \"Hindu middlemen\" in order to severe the link between the \"local rich class\" and their counterparts in the Indian state.\n\nOn 27 October 1990, the organisation adopted a resolution supporting the merger of Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan.\n\nThe group grew and units were set up at the Jammu province by February 1991. Field intelligence units were also set up across different places. Cadre was extensively mobilised in the name of Islam The establishment of the Supreme Advisory Council followed by a student wing took place in spring 1991. The latter though became a separate organisation in its entirety, in June 1991, under the leadership of Nasir-ul-Islam, after it organised the kidnapping of a high-profile bureaucrat. After a 1991 merger with Tahreek-e-Jihad-e-Islami (TJI), which was backed by Jaamat, Hizb-ul-Mujahideen gained significant military might and its strength reached about 10,000 fighters.\n\nBy the end of March 1991, HuM demanded that the local government provides the list of all permanent residence certificates and that all non-residents leave the state within one month.\n\nThe first three years of the insurgency (1990–92) were dominated by the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF). Despite being supported by Pakistan, they under the renewed ideology of their new leaders shifted to a secular pro-independence stance and attracted huge support in the valley in their strategy to organize a mass-resistance, that would compel India to withdraw from Kashmir.\n\nBut, a lack of social fabric among the new mass-recruits, (who often did not share a common ideology) coupled with an urban-centric focus led to the gradual weakening of JKLF Indian counter-insurgency operations removed much of its leadership, wiping out its central control. Pakistan was also heavily incentivized by the popularization of Jihadi sentiments in the Kashmiri youth; and utilized the situation to gain control over Kashmir. By 1991, ISI had begun to cease providing of funds to JKLF, (which stood its ground for independence of the territory) and were instead advocating splinter factions to break off and form their own militant groups after receiving due training in their territory. Subsequently, Hizbul Mujahideen came to be favored by the ISI as a potentially valuable resource and finally, after JKLF rejected certain demands of nuancing their pro-independence stance; all of their erstwhile camps in Azad Kashmir were handed over to Hizbul. Jamaat also scoped the opportunity and choose to infiltrate Hizbul from within, by installing loyal members at key central positions. Numerous jihadi factions too departed from JKLF and were subsumed within Hizbul.\n\nSoon enough, arrests by Indian forces necessitated a re-organisation of the central command and in the reshuffle, Ahsan Dhar, a moderatist leader with an independent mind was asked to step down and Sayeed Salahudeen, a radical Jamaat loyalist, was appointed instead. Dar was soon expelled by Salahudeen loyalists in late 1991 and formed a splinter group-- \"Muslim Mujahideen\", which quickly fell apart after his arrest in 1993. An overall restructuring to enable a collective, hiearchical and institutionalized leadership along the lines of Jaamat soon followed which lend a much-needed organisational strength that lacked JKLF. Hizbul also managed to increase their penetration into the rural belt courtesy the utilization of Jaamat's socio-religious authority and homogeneity. An implementation of Sunni culture in the ground-roots helped their cause further.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Hizb-ul Mujahideen rigidly opposed JKLF, all throughout and had rejected JKLF's nationalist agenda in favor of an Islamist one. There were increasing clashes with one another and the differences reached their peak by 1991, as it publicly opposed JKLF's agreement to a solution of the dispute without the aid of UN resolutions. Military clashes between JKLF and Hizbul became increasingly commonplace after the first such incident in April, 1991 wherein a JKLF area commander was killed. It began to systematically target members of JKLF, killing them and intimidating others to defect. JKLF leaders had alleged HM militants to be informers for the Indian forces and Amanullah Khan even complained of his cadres in Pakistan being coerced to join the ranks of HM. Fuelled by resources from Pakistan State actors and Pakistan Jamaat; Hizbul also targeted other militant groups, killing hundreds while neutralising and disarming more than 7,000.\n\nHizbul also murdered several of the pro-independence intelligentsia with JKLF leanings. Some of these killings included Hriday Nath Wanchoo, a Kashmiri Pandit human rights advocate. Hizbul militant Ashiq Hussain Faktoo was convicted for his killing. Other prominent killings included Dr. Abdul Ahad Guru who was a cardiologist and JKLF ideologue, Mirwaiz Qazi Nisar and Mirwaiz Maulvi Farooq, Mohammed Maqbool Malik, Prof. Abdul Ahad Wani, Muhammad Sultan Bhat, Abdul Ghani Lone, and Abdul Majeed Dar.\n\nHizbul was instrumental in preventing the return of Kashmiri Pandits after their ethnic cleansing from the valley, Salahudeen spoke of them being Hindu agents whilst threatening to auction their properties. Many of operations of the outfit during 1994-95 were designed to polarise the masses along religious lines.\n\nBy 1994, many JKLF members had denounced militancy and some even joined state politics, which led to further splintering amongst JKLF and a complete yield of its military dominance to Hizbul which grew up to be the major force in Kashmir despite facing a much widespread and effective counter insurgency response from the Indian forces. This survival has been attributed to its widespread penetration across rural networks. By 1996, the arm-bearing factions of JKLF were entirely crushed and with other local insurgent factions having either disbanded or becoming defunct or having switched loyalties to the Indian cause; Hizbul was the sole militant group operating in the valley.\n\nAnalysts and academics though believe that Hizbul lacked popular support in the valley and that their aversion to pro-independence ideas and Sufi practices alienated many Kashmiris.\n\nBut roughly beginning the same time, Hizbul actually started to lose their popular influence in the valley. People from the fellow militant groups often aligned with the counter insurgency operations to avenge the Hizbul or protect themselves from the Hizbul, killing many Hizbul commanders in the process. They also imparted ground intelligence to the Indian forces; thus systematically degrading Hizbul's own networks. A simultaneous targeting of Jaamat's militants led to their revoking theirs open support for Hizbul, which destroyed the social fabric of Hizbul to a large extent. By the end of the 1990s; Hizbul was forced to go for a retreat. The Al-Badr faction split in 1998 due to a dislike of excessive interference by Jaamat.\n\nIn the following years, the group started to fragment as ISI pushed foreign extremists into Hizbul. Rivalries developed often leading to violence, and one such incident culminated in the killing of 21 people in a Pakistan administered Kashmir village in 1998. Several Hizbul members were increasingly displeased with ISI's manners of treating the Kashmiris and with more militants joining mainstream politics, they were pushed to the sidelines.\n\nStarting April 2000, there were alleged parleys between Abdul Majid Dar, the Kashmir commander and other top leaders of Hizbul with Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials in Delhi and other venues; that led to the build-up of a ceasefire offer. Offensive counter-insurgency operations against the group were also reduced. On 24 July 2000, Dar, along with four other Hizb commander (some Hizb commanders didn't agree with Dar) made an unconditional ceasefire declaration for a span of 3 months, from the outskirts of Srinagar and asserted it to be backed by the consent of the local populace, who were surveyed. Majeed Dar had also apparently visited Pakistan before the announcement for consultations with the HM Central Command. The ceasefire was welcomed and approved in India, near unanimously and was immediately ratified by the Pakistan-based commander Sayeed Salahudeen who until then was against any diplomatic resolution. The Pakistani government soon enough ordered its forward posts on the LOC, to abide by a no-shoot first policy.\n\nA unit-commander from Pak administered Kashmir in the Pir-Panjal area disagreed with the ceasefire and was expelled along with his faction; leading to a violent clash with the Pakistan Jaamat.\n\nOn the next day, Muttahida Jihad Council (MJC), a coalition of 16 radical Islamist organisations (that comprised Hizbul and was incidentally chaired by Salahudeen himself), severely criticised the ceasefire declaration. Hizbul was soon revoked of its council membership and Salahudeen lost his chair. Jamaat leaders too vociferously criticised the ceasefire declaration and alleged it to be an act of sabotage. LeT launched multiple attacks killing and injuring numerous civilians as a form of protest against the ceasefire declaration with an aim to derail it.\n\nWhilst two rounds of talks were smoothly held and a cricket match was played out between Indian armed forces and Hizbul, Salahuddin was allegedly forced by ISI to set out a deadline for tripartite talks of August 8. The Indian government did not agree to indulge with Pakistan and whilst Pakistani government initially maintained a neutral posture of abiding by the wishes of the Kashmiri populace, it later changed its stance and demanded a representation. Salahuddin then called off the talks on August 8 under flimsy pretexts; interpreting an address of Vajpayee to the Parliament as calling for a strict abidance of the Indian delegation to the Indian constitution. He also re-warned of more escalation and threatened to spill their activities over the rest of India; incidentally Hizbul's earlier stance was to wage war against the Indian occupation but not against India. The US State Department as well as the British Foreign Office blamed Hizbul for the failure of the process.\n\nThe ceasefire move, its immediate endorsement and subsequent withdrawal highlighted deep divisions between the more hawkish operatives in Pakistan administered Kashmir and those based in India. Dar was soon removed from his role of military commander and in May 2002, he was formally expelled from the Hizb along with a number of supporters and commanders whilst being.denounced as an agent of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). Dar and several other ex-leaders were assassinated by Hizbul between 2001 and 2003. By 2003, most key leaders of Hizbul were in Azad Kashmir and they were quite inactive in Kashmir; a fragmented Hizbul survived a total collapse but had metamorphosed into a vanguard group.\n\nYet, in 2004 it was still “regarded as one of the most influential groups involved in the conflict over Kashmir.” As of 2009, it was supposedly “the brand name of the Kashmir militancy because of being the largest and the most important in terms of its effectiveness in perpetrating violence across Kashmir.”\n\nOn 8 July 2016, Hizbul Mujahideen commander, Burhan Muzaffar Wani, along with 2 other insurgents were shot dead by Indian security forces. Widespread protests erupted in the Kashmir valley after Wani's death, causing unrest in the valley for nearly half a year. More than 96 people died while over 15,000 civilians and more than 4,000 security personnel were injured. The violence which erupted after his death was described as the worst unrest in the region since the 2010 Kashmir unrest, with Kashmir being placed under 53 consecutive days of curfews imposed by authorities.\n\nWani was succeeded by Sabzar Bhat, who had previously been a close aide of his. Indian security forces considered Bhat effective at using social media to recruit youth towards militancy. Indian security forces previously located him in Rathsuna, in March 2017, but he was able to evade them after a 15-hour gunfight that left one policeman dead.\n\nBhat was killed in May 2017 and subsequently buried in Pulwama. His death sparked clashes and a police-imposed curfew, during which a youth was killed in clashes with the Central Reserve Police Force. Internet and phone service across Kashmir was suspended in an attempt to calm the region.\n\nA previously-unknown militant group, Mujahideen Taliban-e-Kashmir, claimed it had provided information on Bhat to security forces. The claim remains unverified, though some analysts suggested it reflected a growing schism between various militant groups in Kashmir, with members of Hizbul Mujahideen concerned that Zakir Musa may have betrayed Bhat.\n\nRiyaz Naikoo, the Hizbul Mujahideen chief in Kashmir Valley, was killed by Indian security forces on 6 May 2020. He was categorized as A++ in the security force's list of Top Militant Commanders in the Valley. He was involved in killing of a number of policemen. Naikoo has also released many videos and audios threatening informers and local policemen to stay away from his operations. He is reported to have significant support from Over Ground Workers (OGWs). On 10 May 2020, Gazi Haider was appointed the new operations commander. Soon after, on 19 May 2020, Ashraf Sehrai's son, Junaid Sehrai, 29, a top Hizbul Mujaheddin commander, was killed in an encounter in Nawakadal, Srinagar on 19 May 2020.\n\n\n\n"}

Forms of subsidies include direct housing subsidies, non-profit housing, public housing, rent supplements, and some forms of co-operative and private sector housing. In the United States, subsidized housing is often called \"affordable housing.\"\n\nThere is scientific research suggesting that actions to facilitate people's access to housing contribute to lower poverty.\n\nSome co-operative housing may offer subsidized units, but its main mandate is not subsidization. Its operating mandate is to offer non profit housing, where the rents or housing charges as they are called, goes back into the maintenance of the building instead of the profit of a landlord. Co-operative housing is controlled by the members of the co-op, which is run by a board of directors. There is no outside landlord. In most cases, all residents of the co-op become members and are owners, and agree to follow certain by-laws. Some co-ops are subsidized housing because they receive government funding to support a rent-geared-to-income program for low-income residents. There are other co-ops that are market-rate and limited equity, these types of cooperatives do not receive government funding and are not subsidized housing. In addition to providing affordable housing, some co-ops serve the needs of specific communities, including seniors, artists, and persons with disabilities.\n\nExamples of co-operative housing include: College Houses, Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB), and Habitat '67, and regular rental housing be they regular looking apartments, townhouses or high end buildings such as those overlooking Central Park in New York City.\n\nHousing subsidies are a government's financial assistance to help provide housing.\n\nThe largest housing subsidy in the US is the home mortgage interest deduction, which allows homeowners with mortgages on first homes, second homes, and even boats with bathrooms to lower their taxes owed. The cost to the federal government of the mortgage interest deductions in 2018 was approximately $25 billion, down from $60 billion for 2017 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Some states also have the mortgage interest deduction provision. The majority of the home mortgage interest deduction goes to the top 5% income earners in the United States.\n\nSome housing subsidies are also provided to low income tenants in renting housing. These subsidies are often defined by whether the subsidy is given to the landlord and then criteria are set for the tenants they can lease to or whether the subsidy is given to the tenant, typically as a voucher, and they are allowed to find suitable private housing. The subsidy amount is typically based on the tenant's income, usually the difference between the rent and 30% of the tenant's gross income, but other formulas have been used.\n\nIn rare cases a financial institution or non-profit organization will provide mortgage loans at rates that are not profitable for the sake of a specific group. In Canada one such organization is Non-Profit Housing Subsidies Canada which provides subsidized mortgage loans to employees and volunteers of other non-profit organizations.\n\nNon-profit housing\n\nNon-profit housing is owned and managed by private non-profit groups such as churches, ethnocultural communities or by governments. Many units are provided by community development corporations (CDCs). They use private funding and government subsidies to support a rent-geared-towards-income program for low-income tenants.\n\nPublic housing is real property owned and managed by the government. Tenants must meet specific eligibility requirements.\n\nRent supplements are subsidies paid by the government to private landlords who accept low-income tenants. The supplements make up the difference between rental \"market price\" and the amount of rent paid by tenants, for example 30% of the tenants income. A notable example of a rent supplement in the United States is Section 8 of the Housing Act of 1937 ().\n\nAccording to a 2018 study, major cuts in rental subsidies for poor households in the United Kingdom led to lowered house prices.\n\n\n"}

His belief and practice of Gandhian principles resulted in him being also known as \"Thar Ka Gandhi\". His contribution towards the welfare of the farmers has earned him the title of \"Kisano Ka Messiah\". He was born in village Dhani-Panchera of district Churu in Rajasthan. His mother’s name was Bhuri Devi and wife was Jadav Devi.\n\nDaulatram Saran was educated at the government high school in Sardarshahar.

Hasland is located South of Spital, East of Birdholme and North of Grassmoor. Hasland is a ward of the Borough of Chesterfield. The ward population at the 2011 Census was 6,615. The A617 (Hasland By-Pass) links Hasland, along with Chesterfield, to the M1. Historically a village, with many local residents continuing to refer to it as a village, it expanded greatly during the 20th century and now merges with Chesterfield itself.\n\nThe expansion of Hasland has created a dense array of shops and services, including: a theatre, three schools, two churches, two medical centres and a couple of industrial estates.\n\nIn 1913, Alderman Eastwood (Mayor of Chesterfield, 1905–1908) donated the park to the public in memory of his late father. The Deputy Mayor, Ald. C.P. Markham, showed enormous gratitude in accepting the gift: \"Hasland is now set up for all time. It has got a very wide street and Ald. Eastwood has finished it off by giving one of the most handsome parks there will be in this part of the world\". The first condition on donating the park was that it should be called \"Hasland Park\", however Eastwood later accepted the council's decision to name the park \"Eastwood Park\".\n\nEastwood Park was closed for over 6 months in September 2012, as part of a major restoration project. Chesterfield Borough Council received £1.07m from the Heritage Lottery Fund and contributed a further £201,000. The original four-week closure was extended following complications in planning and construction work, partially due to flooding during early 2013. The restoration project includes improvements to the Hasland Village Hall and fountain, modernisation of play areas, a new sports pavilion and a new multi-use games area. The council also announced plans to rename the park to Eastwood Park, a Queen Elizabeth II Field, as part of the legacy of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.\nMansfield Road, towards the South-East of Hasland, is home to a row of convenience and specialist shops. These include: a Post Office, petrol station, sweet shop, fish bar, Co-op, greengrocer, florist, bookmakers, and a computer repair shop. Because of the diversity of shops on Mansfield Road, there is little demand for shops elsewhere in Hasland and you can walk to Chesterfield town centre in no time at all.\n\nMansfield Road is currently at the centre of controversy regarding a newly installed set of traffic lights. Following a serious incident in March 2013 and the effect on parking and many local businesses, Derbyshire County Council are to replace the traffic lights in favour of a mini roundabout.\nMany local residents have commented that the installation of traffic lights was completely useless, as the previous round-a-bout system was perfectly adequate.\n\nThe Methodist Church was founded in a cottage on Chapel Lane East in 1831 and moved to its present site (on Hampton Street) in 1901.\n\nSt Paul's Church, Hasland is an Anglican church, the parish church of Hasland, and was built in 1850 in the south of Hasland. Before this church was built, most people were baptised, married and buried at Church of St. Mary and All Saints (also an Anglican church) in Chesterfield town centre.\n\nThere are three schools in Hasland, providing education for pupils aged 4–16. There is no sixth form in Hasland, however students normally continue their education at the nearby Chesterfield College or a local sixth form.\n\nHasland Infant School is situated on Eyre Street East and opened in 1904. The Infant School has recently added an extra block of buildings, and is now bigger, with a newer nursery part of the school. Hasland Junior School is situated on The Green, and Hasland Hall Community School (the secondary school) is on Broomfield Avenue.\n\nHasland Junior School is a medium-sized school, catering for about 400 pupils. Before the opening of the new building in September 2007, the school occupied a large split site separated by a busy road, and there was a great deal of movement between the two sites. The new site is now located on the same side of the road as Hasland Hall Community School. The foundation stone of the original school was laid in 1864.\n\nHasland Hall Community School is situated on Broomfield Avenue. It currently caters for around 880 students. The building of 5 new classrooms has recently been completed. These opened in September 2006, and are currently the languages block for the school.\n\nHasland has a thriving Scout group consisting of a Beaver Colony, a Cub Pack, a Scout Troop, two Rainbow Units, three Brownie Packs and two Guide Groups. 1st Hasland meet weekly at the Youth Centre (near Hasland Hall). The Scouts, Cubs and Guides participate in the Annual Remembrance Service, held in Eastwood Park and the St. Georges Day parade in the town centre. In addition to the popular annual Christmas Fayre in Eastwood Park, the Scout Group has also hosted a Summer Fayre in 2010, raising around £1,000 for the group.\n\nNotable residents Hasland include:\n\n\n"}

It improves on the Hartree–Fock method by adding electron correlation effects by means of Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory (RS-PT), usually to second (MP2), third (MP3) or fourth (MP4) order. Its main idea was published as early as 1934 by Christian Møller and Milton S. Plesset.\n\nThe MP perturbation theory is a special case of RS perturbation theory. In RS theory one considers an unperturbed Hamiltonian operator formula_1, to which a small (often external) perturbation formula_2 is added:\n\nHere, \"λ\" is an arbitrary real parameter that controls the size of the perturbation. In MP theory the zeroth-order wave function is an exact eigenfunction of the Fock operator, which thus serves as the unperturbed operator. The perturbation is the correlation potential.\nIn RS-PT the perturbed wave function and perturbed energy are expressed as a power series in λ:\n\nSubstitution of these series into the time-independent Schrödinger equation gives a new equation as formula_6:\n\nEquating the factors of formula_8 in this equation gives a \"k\"th-order perturbation equation, where . See perturbation theory for more details.\n\nThe MP-energy corrections are obtained from Rayleigh–Schrödinger (RS) perturbation theory with the unperturbed Hamiltonian defined as the \"shifted\" Fock operator,\n\nand the perturbation defined as the \"correlation potential\",\n\nwhere the normalized Slater determinant Φ is the lowest eigenstate of the Fock operator:\n\nHere \"N\" is the number of electrons in the molecule under consideration (a factor of 2 in the energy arises from the fact that each orbital is occupied by a pair of electrons with opposite spin), formula_12 is the usual electronic Hamiltonian, formula_13 is the one-electron Fock operator, and \"ε\" is the orbital energy belonging to the doubly occupied spatial orbital \"φ\".\n\nSince the Slater determinant Φ is an eigenstate of formula_14, it follows readily that\n\ni.e. the zeroth-order energy is the expectation value of formula_12 with respect to Φ, the Hartree-Fock energy. Similarly, it can be seen that \"in this formulation\" the MP1 energy\n\nHence, the first meaningful correction appears at MP2 energy.\n\nIn order to obtain the MP2 formula for a closed-shell molecule, the second order RS-PT formula is written in a basis of doubly excited Slater determinants. (Singly excited Slater determinants do not contribute because of the Brillouin theorem). After application of the Slater–Condon rules for the simplification of \"N\"-electron matrix elements with Slater determinants in bra and ket and integrating out spin, it becomes\n\nwhere \"𝜑\" and \"𝜑\" are canonical occupied orbitals and \"𝜑\" and \"𝜑\" are virtual (or unoccupied) orbitals. The quantities \"ε\", \"ε\", \"ε\", and \"ε\" are the corresponding orbital energies. Clearly, through second-order in the correlation potential, the total electronic energy is given by the Hartree–Fock energy plus second-order MP correction: . The solution of the zeroth-order MP equation (which by definition is the Hartree–Fock equation) gives the Hartree–Fock energy. The first non-vanishing perturbation correction beyond the Hartree–Fock treatment is the second-order energy.\n\nEquivalent expressions are obtained by a slightly different partitioning of the Hamiltonian, which results in a different division of energy terms over zeroth- and first-order contributions, while for second- and higher-order energy corrections the two partitionings give identical results. The formulation is commonly used by chemists, who are now large users of these methods. This difference is due to the fact, well known in Hartree–Fock theory, that\n\n(The Hartree–Fock energy is \"not\" equal to the sum of occupied-orbital energies). In the alternative partitioning, one defines\n\nClearly, in this partitioning,\n\nObviously, with this alternative formulation, the Møller–Plesset theorem does not hold in the literal sense that \"E\" ≠ 0. The solution of the zeroth-order MP equation is the sum of orbital energies. The zeroth plus first-order correction yields the Hartree–Fock energy. As with the original formulation, the first non-vanishing perturbation correction beyond the Hartree–Fock treatment is the second-order energy. To reiterate, the second- and higher-order corrections are the same in both formulations.\n\nSecond (MP2), third (MP3), and fourth (MP4) order Møller–Plesset calculations are standard levels used in calculating small systems and are implemented in many computational chemistry codes. Higher level MP calculations, generally only MP5, are possible in some codes. However, they are rarely used because of their cost.\n\nSystematic studies of MP perturbation theory have shown that it is not necessarily a convergent theory at high orders. Convergence can be slow, rapid, oscillatory, regular, highly erratic or simply non-existent, depending on the precise chemical system or basis set.\nThe density matrix for the first-order and higher MP2 wavefunction is of the\ntype known as \"response density\", which differs from the\nmore usual \"expectation value density\". The eigenvalues of\nthe response density matrix (which are the occupation numbers of the MP2 natural orbitals) can therefore be greater than 2 or negative. Unphysical numbers are a sign of a divergent perturbation expansion.\n\nAdditionally, various important molecular properties calculated at MP3 and MP4 level are no better than their MP2 counterparts, even for small molecules.\n\nFor open shell molecules, MPn-theory can directly be applied only to unrestricted Hartree–Fock reference functions (since UHF states are not in general eigenvectors of the Fock operator). However, the resulting energies often suffer from severe spin contamination, leading to large errors. A possible better alternative is to use one of the MP2-like methods based on restricted open-shell Hartree–Fock (ROHF). Unfortunately, there are many ROHF based MP2-like methods because of arbitrariness in the ROHF wavefunction(for example HCPT, ROMP, RMP (also called ROHF-MBPT2), OPT1 and OPT2, ZAPT, IOPT, etc.). Some of the ROHF based MP2-like theories suffer from spin-contamination in their perturbed density and energies beyond second-order.\n\nThese methods, Hartree–Fock, unrestricted Hartree–Fock and restricted Hartree–Fock use a single determinant wave function. Multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) methods use several determinants and can be used for the unperturbed operator, although not uniquely, so many methods, such as complete active space perturbation theory (CASPT2), and Multi-Configuration Quasi-Degenerate Perturbation\nTheory (MCQDPT), have been developed. Unfortunately, MCSCF based methods are not without perturbation series divergences.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1889615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889615", "title": "Battle of Brisbane", "text": "Battle of Brisbane\n\nThe Battle of Brisbane was a riot between United States military personnel on one side and Australian servicemen and civilians on the other, in Brisbane, Queensland's capital city, on 26 and 27 November 1942, during which time the two nations were allies. By the time the violence had been quelled, one Australian soldier was dead and hundreds of Australians and U.S. servicemen had been injured. News reports of these incidents were suppressed overseas, with the causes of the riot not made evident in the few newspaper reports of the event that were published within Australia.\n\nFrom 1942 until 1945 during the Pacific War, up to one million U.S. military personnel, which included around 100,000 African-Americans, were stationed at various locations throughout eastern Australia. These forces included personnel awaiting deployment to combat operations elsewhere in the Pacific, troops resting, convalescing, and/or refitting from previous combat operations, or military personnel manning Allied military bases and installations in Australia. Many U.S. personnel were stationed in and around Brisbane, which was the headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area. Many buildings and facilities around Brisbane were given over to the U.S. military's use. Brisbane found it difficult to cope, starting in December 1941, as their population of roughly 330,000 increased by 80,000 during the peak period. The city was fortified, schools were closed, brownouts enforced, crime increased, and many families sold up and moved inland.\n\nAt the height of the Pacific war, Australian Prime Minister John Curtin raised the roles of American journalists to spread enthusiasm from the U.S. for his country's defence. This showed a new side to how leaders of allied nations could expand American press interaction and influence the White House during the war. \"As a former journalist, Curtin extended his candid press talks and the fledgling Australian radio and newsreel media to involve U.S. reporters in his campaign for an escalated offensive from America’s Southwest Pacific headquarters in Brisbane, Australia,\" says Coatney, who wrote about the subject in his journal. Curtin still lost American press support he needed in order to prevent some of Australia's troops from fighting in the Battle of Burma.\n\nAlthough the military personnel from Australia and the United States usually enjoyed a cooperative and convivial relationship, there were tensions between the two forces that sometimes resulted in violence. Many factors reportedly contributed to these tensions, including the fact that U.S. forces received better rations than Australian soldiers, shops and hotels regularly gave preferential treatment to Americans, and the American custom of \"caressing girls in public\" was seen as offensive to the Australian morals of the day. Lack of amenities for the Australians in the city also played a part. The Americans had PXs offering merchandise, food, alcohol, cigarettes, hams, turkeys, ice cream, chocolates, and nylon stockings at low prices, all items that were either forbidden, heavily rationed, or highly priced to Australians. Australian servicemen were not allowed into these establishments, while Australian canteens on the other hand provided meals, soft drinks, tea, and sandwiches but not alcohol, cigarettes, and other luxuries. Hotels were only allowed to serve alcohol twice a day for one hour at a time of their choosing, leading to large numbers of Australian servicemen on the streets rushing from one hotel to the next and then drinking as quickly as possible before it closed.\n\nU.S. military pay was considerably higher than that of the Australian military and U.S. military uniforms were seen as more appealing than those of the Australians.. The U.S. Army provided silk stockings and candy to American troops which they handed out to Australian women, as well as U.S. Army rations, in a time where Australians were on a poor diet due to rationing of food to civilians. This resulted in U.S. servicemen not only enjoying success in their pursuit of the few available women but also led to many Americans marrying Australian women, facts greatly resented by the Australians. In mid-1942, a reporter walking along Queen Street counted 152 local women in company with 112 uniformed Americans, while only 31 women accompanied 60 Australian soldiers. That it was thought necessary for the media to report this situation indicates the effect of the American presence. (About 12,000 Australian women married American soldiers by the end of the war.) \"They're overpaid, oversexed, and over here\" was a common phrase used by Australians around this time and is still an anecdote recognised by some in modern generations.\n\nAnother concern was the way the Australian military was viewed by America's high command. Douglas MacArthur had already expressed a low opinion of Australian troops, who were then fighting along the Kokoda Track. Though Australia was bearing the brunt of the land war in New Guinea by itself, MacArthur would report back to the United States on \"American victories\", while Australian victories were communicated to the United States as \"American and Allied victories\". Americans' general ignorance of Australia, and American perceptions that Australians lacked a certain \"get-up-and-go\", also soured relations.\n\nLikewise Australians also looked down upon the fighting qualities of Americans; most considered the Americans an inferior fighting force who seemed all glitz and brashness. Even MacArthur was upset and humiliated by reports that during an earlier attack against the perimeter's eastern flank at Buna, American soldiers had dropped their weapons and run from the Japanese. This feeling towards the Americans would be furthered during the Battle of Buna, where Australian troops bore the brunt of the fighting due to American \"inactivity\", and Sanananda, the final victory. Buna, the fourth major Allied victory in New Guinea, was presented not only as the first major victory but an American one. Sanananda, an Australian victory, was presented as merely a mopping-up operation. The Americans would not acknowledge that Australians won the critical battles of Milne Bay, Kokoda and Gona, were largely responsible for the victory at Buna, and were \"overwhelmingly\" responsible for victory at Sanananda. Australians often regarded the U.S. soldiers as boasting how they, and they alone, saved Australia.\n\nAnother factor in 'the war' was the difference between the troops and the provost corps or military police. The military police were forced to do the duty no one else wanted because they were seen as misfits. This caused the Aussie Digger to have little to no respect for them. A rule was stated that the military police had to be unarmed. In Brisbane, the military police were Americans, had the right to be armed, and were seen as arrogant.\n\nWhile race was not a direct causative factor in this instance, it has been cited as a cause of tension between Australians and Americans and as a contributing factor. This tension arose from the treatment and segregation of the African-American soldiers by the U.S. military. Racial issues and segregation also played a substantial role in conflict between locals and Americans in both New Zealand and Britain. While Baker reports that in civilian life white Australians treated Aborigines in largely the same way as white Americans treated blacks, Hall reports that institutional discrimination was \"paternalistic\", varying significantly from state-to-state. Despite official policy ostensibly barring the enlistment of indigenous Australians, in practice, a more flexible approach was adopted that saw many indigenous Australians enlist. Segregation was not practised in the main and Indigenous Australians received equal pay, were promoted on merit and were generally accepted and treated as equals.\n\nTroops of the U.S. 208th Coast Artillery rioted for 10 nights in March 1942, fighting against African-Americans from the 394th Quartermaster Battalion. This was attributed to white American resentment towards African-American access to dance halls and for associating with \"white girls on the streets of Brisbane\". As a result, U.S. military authorities segregated African-Americans, restricting them to the south side of the Brisbane River. However, trouble continued with a major race riot at Wacol, knife fights in South Brisbane and American military police assaulting or killing black troops simply for crossing the Brisbane River. This further incited the Australians, whose culture towards military police was notably different.\n\nAccording to authorities, up to 20 brawls a night were occurring between Australian and American servicemen. In the weeks leading up to the Battle of Brisbane there were several major incidents, including a gun battle between an American soldier and Australian troops near Inkerman which left one Australian and the American dead, an Australian soldier was shot by an American MP in Townsville, an American serviceman and three Australian soldiers in Brisbane's Centenary Place were involved in a confrontation which left one Australian dead, an American soldier was arrested for stabbing three servicemen and a Brisbane woman near the Central railway station, and twenty Australians fought American submariners and members of the USN Shore Patrol, mauling them badly. On the morning of the battle, an Australian soldier was batoned by an American MP in Albert Street.\n\n According to Australian historian Barry Ralph, on 26 November an intoxicated Private James R. Stein of the U.S. 404th Signal Company left the hotel where he had been drinking when it closed at 6:50 p.m. and began walking to the Post Exchange (PX) on the corner of Creek and Adelaide Street some 50m further down the road. He had stopped to talk with three Australians when Private Anthony E. O'Sullivan of the U.S. 814th Military Police Company (MP) approached and asked Stein for his leave pass. While Stein was looking for it, the MP became impatient and asked him to hurry up before grabbing his pass and arresting him. At this the Australians began swearing at the MP and telling him to leave Stein alone. American MPs were not well regarded by Australians because the Australians thought they were arrogant and used batons at the least provocation. When O'Sullivan raised his baton as if to strike one of the Australians, they attacked him. More MPs arrived, blowing whistles, while nearby Australian servicemen and several civilians rushed to help their countrymen. Outnumbered, the MPs retreated to the PX, carrying the injured O'Sullivan. Stein went with them. In the meantime, a crowd of up to 100 Australian servicemen and civilians had gathered and began to besiege the PX, throwing bottles and rocks and breaking windows. Police Inspector Charles Price arrived but could do nothing as the crowd continued to grow, with the American Red Cross Club diagonally opposite the PX also coming under siege.\nSporadic fights broke out throughout the city. The Tivoli Theatre was closed, with servicemen ordered back to their barracks and ships, while soldiers with fixed bayonets escorted women in the city from the area. By 8 p.m. up to 5,000 people were involved in the disturbance. Several Australian MPs removed their armbands and joined in. Corporal Duncan Caporn commandeered a small truck driven by an Australian officer and three soldiers. The truck contained four Owen sub-machine guns, several boxes of ammunition and some hand grenades. The local Brisbane Fire Brigade arrived but simply looked on and did not use their hoses. The American authorities were later to criticise them for not doing so.\n\nThe 738th MP Battalion in the PX started to arm the MPs with shotguns to protect the building and they moved to the front. People in the crowd took umbrage at this demonstration of force and attempted to relieve Private Norbert Grant of C Company of his weapon. He jabbed one Australian with his gun before Gunner Edward S. Webster, a driver with the 2/2nd Australian Anti-Tank Regiment grabbed the barrel, while another soldier grabbed him around the neck. During the scuffle, the gun was discharged three times. The first shot hit Webster in the chest, killing him instantly. The following two shots hit Private Kenneth Henkel in the cheek and forearm, Private Ian Tieman in the chest, Private Frank Corrie in the thigh, Sapper De Vosso in the thigh and Lance Corporal Richard Ledson was wounded in the left thigh and left hand and also received a compound fracture of the left ankle. Ledson was later discharged due to his injuries. Two civilians were also hit, Joseph Hanlon was wounded in the leg and 18-year-old Walter Maidment was also wounded.\n\nIn the confusion, Grant managed to run back towards the PX, hitting an Australian over the head with his shotgun, breaking the butt of his weapon while doing so. An American soldier, Private Joseph Hoffman, received a fractured skull in the scuffle. By 10 pm the crowd had dispersed, leaving the ground floor of the American PX destroyed. A war correspondent, John Hinde, was on a hotel balcony overlooking the scene and later stated \"The most furious battle I ever saw during the war was that night in Brisbane. It was like a civil war.\"\n\nOn the following night, a crowd of 500 to 600 Australian servicemen gathered outside the Red Cross building. The PX building was under heavy security and heavily armed American MPs were located on the first floor of the Red Cross. NCOs went through the crowd and confiscated several hand grenades. In Queen Street, a group of soldiers armed with MP batons ran into 20 U.S. MPs who formed a line and drew their handguns. An Australian officer intervened and persuaded the American commander to take his men away from the area. The crowd then moved to the corner of Queen and Edward Streets outside MacArthur's headquarters in the AMP Building and began shouting abuse towards the building. The intersection was filled with rings of Australians beating up GIs and more than 20 were injured. U.S. Army Sergeant Bill Bentson, who was present on both nights, recalled how he was amazed to see \"Americans flying up in the air.\"\n\nAustralian writer Margaret Scott who, along with her American husband, had been assaulted in Edward Street during the riot, has stated that several U.S. servicemen were beaten to death and one shot in the fighting but there are no official records supporting this claim.\n\nOn the first night one Australian serviceman was killed, eight people suffered gunshot wounds and several hundred people were injured. The second night, eight U.S. MPs, one serviceman and four American officers were hospitalised with countless others injured. The units involved in the riots were relocated out of Brisbane, the MPs' strength was increased, the Australian canteen was closed and the American PX was relocated.\n\nPvt. Grant was later court-martialled by the U.S. military authorities for manslaughter in relation to the death of Webster, but was acquitted on the grounds of self-defence. Five Australians were convicted of assault as a result of the events described above, and one was jailed for six months.\n\nThe Chief Censor's Office in Brisbane ordered that \"No cabling or broadcasting of details of tonight's Brisbane servicemen's riot. Background for censors only: one Australian killed, six wounded.\" The Brisbane \"Courier Mail\" did publish a heavily censored article the next day about the incident. Although the article mentioned the death and injuries it did not give any idea of nationalities involved or any specific details. It is believed that the incident was never reported by U.S. media and American servicemen in Brisbane had their mail censored to remove any mention. As a result of the secrecy many rumours and exaggerated stories circulated in Brisbane over the following weeks including one saying that 15 Australian servicemen had been shot by Americans with machine guns with the bodies being piled on the Post Office steps.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Brisbane, resentment towards American troops led to several smaller riots in Townsville, Rockhampton and Mount Isa. Similar riots in other states also followed: Melbourne on 1 December 1942, Bondi on 6 February 1943, Perth in January 1944 and Fremantle in April 1944.\n\n"}

Until the BBC changed its archiving policy in 1978, thousands of hours of programming, in all genres, were deleted. Other affected BBC series include \"Dad's Army\", \"Z-Cars\", \"The Wednesday Play\", \"Till Death Us Do Part\", \"Steptoe and Son\" and \"Not Only... But Also\". ITV regional franchises also deleted many programmes, including early videotaped episodes of \"The Avengers\".\n\n\"Doctor Who\" is unusual, however, in that each of its 97 missing episodes survives in audio form, recorded off-air by fans at home. Most episodes are also represented by production stills, tele-snaps, or short video clips. Furthermore, after careful restoration, all 1970s episodes are available in full colour, which is not always the case for other series.\n\nEfforts to locate missing episodes continue, both by the BBC and by fans of the series. Recovered episodes have been extensively restored for release on VHS and DVD; surviving soundtracks have been released on cassette and CD. Many missing episodes have had their visuals reconstructed, either through specially commissioned animation or use of surviving footage and photographs.\nBetween approximately 1967 and 1978, large quantities of videotape and film stored in the BBC's Engineering department and film libraries, respectively, were wiped or destroyed to make way for newer programmes. This happened for several reasons, primarily the belief that there was no practical value to its retention.\n\nThe actors' union Equity had actively fought against the introduction of TV recording since the 1950s, when it first became a practical proposition. Before workable television recording was developed, if a broadcaster wished to repeat a programme (usually a one-off play), he had to re-hire the actors to perform it again, live, for additional fees. Equity's concern was that if broadcasters kept recordings of the original performances, they would be able to re-broadcast them indefinitely, which would reduce the amount of new production and threaten the livelihoods of its members. Although Equity could not prevent recording altogether, it added standard clauses to its members' contracts that stipulated that recordings could only be repeated a limited number of times within a specific timeframe, and deliberately set the fees for further use so high that broadcasters would consider it unjustifiable to spend so much money repeating an old programme rather than making a new one. Consequently, recordings whose repeat rights had expired were considered to be of no further domestic use to the broadcasters.\nMost \"Doctor Who\" episodes were made on two-inch videotape for initial broadcast and then telerecorded onto 16 mm film by BBC Enterprises for further commercial exploitation. Enterprises used 16 mm for overseas sales as it was considerably cheaper to buy and easier to transport than videotape. It also circumvented the problem of different countries' incompatible video standards, as film was a universal medium whereas videotape was not. The BBC had no central archive at the time; the Film Library kept programmes that had been made on film, while the Engineering Department was responsible for storing videotapes. BBC Enterprises only kept copies of programmes that they deemed commercially exploitable. They had little dedicated storage space, and tended to place piles of film canisters wherever they could find space for them at their Villiers House property.\n\nThe Engineering Department had no mandate to archive the programme videotapes they held, although typically they would not be wiped or junked until the relevant production department or BBC Enterprises indicated that they had no further use for the tapes. The first \"Doctor Who\" master videotapes to be wiped were those for the serial \"The Highlanders\", which were erased on 9 March 1967, a mere two months after Episode 4's original transmission. Further erasing of \"Doctor Who\" master videotapes by the Engineering Department continued into the 1970s. Eventually, every master videotape of the programme's first 253 episodes (1963–69) was destroyed or wiped. The final 1960s master tapes to be erased were those for the 1968 serial \"Fury from the Deep\", in late 1974.\n\nDespite the destruction of these masters, BBC Enterprises held an almost complete archive (bar a single episode of \"The Daleks' Master Plan\" which was never telerecorded) of the series in the form of their 16 mm film telerecording copies until approximately 1972. From around 1972 to 1978, BBC Enterprises also disposed of much of their older material, including many episodes of \"Doctor Who.\"\n\nEnterprises' episodes were usually junked because their rights agreements with the actors and writers to sell the programmes abroad had expired. With many broadcasters around the world now switching to colour transmission, it was not deemed worthwhile extending agreements to sell the older black-and-white material.\n\nThe BBC Film Library, meanwhile, had no responsibility for storing programmes that had not originated on film, and there were conflicting views between the Film Library and BBC Enterprises over which party held the responsibility for archiving programmes. As each body believed it the other's responsibility to archive the material, each thought nothing of destroying its own copies as necessary. This lack of communication contributed to the erasure of much of the Corporation's film archive of older black-and-white programming. While thousands of other programmes have been destroyed in this way around the world, the missing \"Doctor Who\" episodes are probably the best-known example of how the lack of a consistent programme archiving policy risks permanent loss.\n\nFollowing the purges and subsequent recoveries, gaps in the \"Doctor Who\" archive are spread unevenly through its first 11 seasons. Major losses mostly affect First and Second Doctor serials; although two stories are missing just one episode each (\"The Tenth Planet\", Episode 4 and \"The Web of Fear\" Episode 3), other stories are lost altogether. Patrick Troughton's era as the Second Doctor is particularly affected; of the 14 stories comprising his first two seasons, only \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\" and \"The Enemy of the World\" are complete, and these only exist due to telerecordings later returned from Hong Kong and Nigeria, respectively.\n\nAll stories starring Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor are complete, though many episodes no longer survive on their original videotapes and were only available from black-and-white overseas prints upon recovery; these episodes have subsequently been restored to colour using a variety of methods. In order of original transmissions, the very last \"Doctor Who\" master videotapes to be wiped were the first episodes of the 1974 serials \"Invasion of the Dinosaurs\" and \"Death to the Daleks\". The latter was recovered from overseas, initially from a tape in the NTSC format, and later in the original PAL format on a tape returned from Dubai.\n\nFor four years, Episode 1 of \"Invasion of the Dinosaurs\" was the only Pertwee episode to be entirely missing from the archives, until a black-and-white 16 mm copy was returned to the BBC in June 1983. The story was released on DVD with a partially recolourised version of Episode 1, alongside a higher-quality monochrome transfer of the episode, in \"The UNIT Files\" box set. With the exception of the final shot of episode three of \"The Deadly Assassin\" (1976), archival holdings from \"Death to the Daleks\" Episode 2 onwards are complete on the original broadcast videotapes.\n\nUnrelated to the regular archive purges, the final shot of \"The Deadly Assassin\" Episode 3 (1976) has been excised from the master copy. The shot was removed after its initial UK transmission, following complaints from Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association. Subsequent repeats and commercial releases have restored the shot from off-air video copies.\n\nInternally, the wiping policy officially came to an end in 1978, when the means to further exploit programmes by taking advantage of the new market for home videocassette recordings started to become apparent. The prevailing view had also begun to shift toward the attitude that archive programmes should, in any case, be preserved for posterity and historical and cultural reasons.\n\nThe BBC Film Library was turned into a combined Film & Videotape Library for the preservation of both media. The Film Library at the time held only 47 episodes of 1960s \"Doctor Who\"; they had once held 53, but six episodes had either been junked or gone missing. Junkings at BBC Enterprises, however, continued until the intervention of Ian Levine, a record producer and fan of the programme. Following the transfer of episodes still held by Enterprises, there were 152 episodes of \"Doctor Who\" no longer held by the BBC, although subsequent efforts have reduced that number to 97.\n\nAmong the most sought-after single lost episode is Episode 4 of the final William Hartnell serial, \"The Tenth Planet\", which ends with the First Doctor's regeneration into the Second. The only portion of the episode still in existence, bar a few poor-quality silent 8mm clips, is the final 27 seconds, comprising the regeneration itself and a few seconds leading up to it. The sequence had been shown in a 1973 episode of \"Blue Peter\" and was retained in that show's archive.\n\nEven after the end of the purge, other archive issues persist. Serials from Seasons 22–26 were shown in Germany, with soundtracks dubbed into German language; some of these episodes no longer exist in German television archives.\n\nOn 20 April 2006, it was announced on \"Blue Peter\" that a life-sized Dalek would be given to anyone who found and returned one of the missing episodes.\n\nIn January 2007, ITV began a campaign called \"Raiders of the Lost Archive\" and although the campaign was run by ITV, they were also looking to find \"Doctor Who\" episodes and other BBC shows. One episode of the Raiders of the Lost Archive show aired in January 2007 and a further two episodes in July 2009.\n\nIn December 2012, the \"Radio Times\" listings magazine announced it was launching the hunt for more \"Doctor Who\" episodes, to tie-in with the show's 50th anniversary. The \"Radio Times\" issued its own list of missing episodes. The magazine has also set up an email address specifically for \"Doctor Who\" missing episodes that the public can use to contact it if they have any information.\n\nCompared with other BBC series broadcast in the 1960s, \"Doctor Who\" is well-represented in surviving episodes. Of the 253 episodes broadcast during the 1960s, 156 still exist – mainly due to copies produced for overseas sales. For example, Seasons 1 and 2, the most widely sold abroad of the 1960s era, are missing only nine and two episodes, respectively. By contrast, the less well-sold Season 4 has no complete serials, while Season 5 has only two complete serials (\"The Tomb of the Cybermen\" and \"The Enemy of the World\"). \"Doctor Who\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> popularity and high profile have also helped to ensure the return of episodes which, for other less well-remembered programmes, might never have occurred.\n\nOf all ongoing BBC series from the 1960s, only \"Steptoe and Son\" has a better survival record, with all episodes existing in some form. \"Doctor Who\" is also comparatively rare amongst contemporaries in that all of its 1970s episodes exist as masters or telerecordings, while other series such as \"Z-Cars\" and \"Dixon of Dock Green\" are missing episodes from as late as 1975.\n\n, 97 episodes were unaccounted for. The missing episodes span 26 serials, including 10 full serials. Most of the gaps are from seasons 3, 4, and 5, which currently lack a total of 79 episodes across 21 (out of 26) serials. By contrast, seasons 1, 2, and 6 are missing just 18 episodes, across 5 (out of 26) serials. Of these missing stories, all but three – \"Marco Polo\", \"Mission to the Unknown\", and \"The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve\" – have surviving clips. All episodes also have full surviving audio tracks.\n\n, many of these missing serials have been officially \"completed\" by using animation, and then subsequently released commercially by BBC Worldwide.\n\nWhile the Patrick Troughton era is missing more episodes (53 as compared to 44 for William Hartnell), there are more Hartnell stories completely missing (6 as compared to 4). Serials highlighted in are missing all episodes. Serials highlighted in are missing more than half of their episodes. All others listed are missing at least one, but no more than half, of their episodes.\n\nSerials that are over 50% complete (e.g., \"The Reign of Terror\", \"The Tenth Planet\") have been issued as standalone releases, with the missing episodes bridged using animation, visual reconstructions, or narration to the camera. Surviving episodes which form 50% or less of a complete story – referred to as \"orphaned\" episodes – have been released by the BBC in compilations (e.g., \"Lost in Time\"), or as extras on releases of complete serials. A few four-episode serials of which 50% remain (e.g., \"The Underwater Menace\", \"The Moonbase\") have also been issued as standalone releases.\n\n\"Planet of Giants\" is another odd example, having originally been recorded as four episodes, directed by Mervyn Pinfield and Douglas Camfield. To create a faster-paced climax, Episodes 3 and 4 were combined and reduced to form a single episode. The serial's 2012 DVD release features a reconstruction of the original episodes, directed by Ian Levine. The production rebuilds the deleted scenes using CGI, footage from elsewhere in the serial, and re-recorded dialogue from Carole Ann Ford, William Russell, and actors impersonating the rest of the cast.\nWhen the BBC's complete holdings (both the BBC Film & Videotape Library and the BBC Enterprises) were first audited in 1978, the following episodes were absent from their collective archives, but have subsequently been returned to the Corporation through various methods. The 16 stories have all episodes existing as a result. Except where indicated, all episodes were returned as 16 mm telerecording negatives or prints:\nIn the years since the BBC archive was first audited in 1978, a number of episodes then absent have been returned from various sources.\n\nWhen the BBC audited its Film Library in 1977, only 47 episodes were found to exist. These Film Library copies were a random sampling of viewing prints for various episodes, along with seven of the nine episodes that had originally been telerecorded onto film for editing and/or transmission, rather than recorded to videotape. These film-originated masters were stored in the Film Library, rather than in the Engineering Department with the videotapes. The presence of the viewing prints is less easily explained.\n\nThe Film Library's remit covers material originated on film, not on videotape – yet two of the film-originated episodes of \"Doctor Who\" (\"The Power of the Daleks\" Episode 6 and \"The Wheel in Space\" Episode 5) were junked by the Film Library, while it held such unexplained material as 16 mm copies of \"The Tenth Planet\" Episodes 1–3, presumably viewing prints which were mistakenly returned to them at some point instead of BBC Enterprises. Most surprisingly of all, they also retained a 16 mm telerecording copy of the original untransmitted pilot, presumably a viewing print made in 1963 and subsequently lodged at the Library.\n\nThe Film Library also held high-quality original film sequences made for insertion into videotaped episodes. Some of these, such as those from Episodes 1–2 of \"The Daleks' Master Plan\", survive to this day. Other junked sequences were mistakenly entered into a film library computer system, leading to an impression that they had existed for some years afterward, and inaccurate speculation that the BBC was still destroying clips well into the early 1980s.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the Film and Videotape Library, an audit of the Engineering Department found 60 of the 128 Third Doctor episodes starring Jon Pertwee, which in addition to the Film Library's copies of the film-originated \"Spearhead from Space\", brought that Doctor's episode count up to 64 out of 128.\n\nIn 1978, Ian Levine located another 65 episodes from the show's first six seasons (plus 14 previously existing episodes), at the BBC Enterprises film vault at Villiers House in London. The episodes comprise 17 full serials, mostly from seasons 1 and 2. According to Levine, the prints of \"The Daleks\" were flagged to be junked that very day.\n\nLevine alerted the new Film and Videotape Library's archive selector, Sue Malden, who paid her own visit to Villiers House and found every remaining Jon Pertwee episode (albeit as a 16 mm black-and-white telerecording), except for two from his final season: \"Death to the Daleks\" and \"Invasion of the Dinosaurs\", Episodes 1.\n\nIn August 1988, 10 years after Levine's and Malden's visits, Episodes 1 and 4–6 of the six-part story \"The Ice Warriors\" were discovered in a cupboard at Villiers House when the Corporation was in the process of moving out of the building.\n\nShortly after the junking process was halted and the BBC established its Film and Videotape Library for the purpose of storage and preservation, archive selector Sue Malden began to audit what material remained in the BBC's stores. When investigations revealed large gaps in the collection, Malden turned her inquiries to the National Film and Television Archive – which promptly returned three full Second Doctor serials – \"The Dominators\", \"The Krotons\", and \"The War Games\", adding seven more episodes and completing two of those serials. These all were standard 16 mm film telerecordings with the exception of \"The Dominators\" Episode 3, which was a 35 mm print.\n\nEpisodes 4 and 5 of \"The Dominators\" originated from a foreign broadcaster, and had been slightly edited; the missing footage was restored later, through a mix of censor clips and more complete prints held by private collectors.\n\nAn appeal to broadcasters in other countries who had shown the programme (notably Canada and African nations such as Nigeria) produced \"lost\" episodes from the archives of their television companies. \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\", for example, was recovered in this manner from Rediffusion Television in Hong Kong in 1992. Of the 50 episodes recovered since the original BBC audit of its holdings, 24 have been returned from overseas broadcasters:\nNote that on occasion some broadcasters purchased \"Doctor Who\" telerecordings (usually 16 mm) but subsequently cancelled the order.\n\nNigerian television has been a particularly fruitful source for episode recovery; a total of 15 out of the 50 episodes recovered since 1978 have been reclaimed from Nigeria, leading to the completion of three full serials (\"The Time Meddler\", \"The War Machines\", and \"The Enemy of the World\").\n\nIn October 1984, copies of \"A Land of Fear\", \"Guests of Madame Guillotine\", and \"A Change of Identity\", along with another copy of \"Prisoners of Conciergerie\" (which was already found in 1982), were found in Cyprus. They were duly returned early in 1985 and the recovery was formally announced in July of that year. Cyprus did not screen\" The Reign of Terror\" (broadcasts ended with the showing of episode 6 of \"The Sensorites\" on 25 November 1966). As a result of these episode recoveries only two episodes (parts 4 and 5, \"The Tyrant of France\" and \"A Bargain of Necessity\") remain missing; although copies of these episodes had also been held in Cyprus, they were probably destroyed in the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus. For the 2013 DVD release, episodes 4 and 5 were animated by Planet 55 Studios and Big Finish Productions.\n\n\"The Tomb of the Cybermen\" was prepared for release in early 1992 on cassette as part of the \"Missing Stories\" collection, with narration by Jon Pertwee. Then in late 1991, telerecordings of all four episodes were returned to the BBC from the Hong Kong-based Rediffusion company. In May 1992, the serial was released on VHS with a special introduction from director Morris Barry.\n\nBetween 1991 and 2013, the serial was believed to be the only complete story from Season 5 (and the only complete serial to feature Deborah Watling) before the complete run of \"The Enemy of the World\" was returned from Nigeria in 2013.\n\nFollowing months of rumours, in October 2013 a BBC press conference announced the return of 11 episodes (including two previously existing) from a television relay station in the city of Jos, Nigeria. In the course of his work abroad, Philip Morris of Television International Enterprises Archives had discovered episodes 1–6 of \"The Enemy of the World\" and episodes 1–6 of \"The Web of Fear\" and returned 11 of these to the BBC. Episode 3 of \"The Web Of Fear\" had been part of the find, but by the end of protracted negotiations for the return of the film cans, the episode had disappeared from the cache, with the presumption that it was sold to a private collector.\nThe return of the nine missing episodes was the single largest recovery of \"Doctor Who\" episodes in 25 years, resulting in only the second full serial from Troughton's first two seasons to be restored to the BBC.\n\nBoth serials were promptly released on iTunes, with DVD releases following over the next few months. On both the iTunes and the DVD release, episode 3 of \"The Web of Fear\" was represented by a tele-snap reconstruction, edited by John Kelly.\n\nSeveral episodes have been returned by private film collectors, who at some point acquired 16 mm film prints intended for sale to foreign broadcasters.\n\nRoger Stevens was working for the BBC as a film editor in the 1980s, and one morning, as he was travelling to work by train, he bumped into a BBC co-worker and they began to talk about \"Doctor Who\" episodes. The BBC projectionist mentioned that he had nine episodes of \"Doctor Who\" that Stevens could buy for £25. In the summer of 1981, Stevens bought \"The Space Museum\" episode 1, \"The Abominable Snowmen\" episode 2, \"The Moonbase\" episode 4, \"Invasion of the Dinosaurs\" episode 1, and three episodes of \"Carnival of Monsters\". Stevens then contacted Ian Levine to find out what was missing from the BBC archive; Levine confirmed that \"The Abominable Snowmen\" episode 2 and \"Invasion of the Dinosaurs\" episode 1 were currently missing.\n\nStevens gave these prints to Levine, who returned \"The Abominable Snowmen\" to the BBC in February 1982, although he held back \"Invasion of the Dinosaurs\" from the BBC for a while. This was later returned to the BBC by Levine in June 1983, who then made a copy and returned the original to Levine.\n\n\"The Reign of Terror\" was recovered by Bruce Campbell when he attended a film fair in the 1980s and began chatting to a stall holder who informed him that one of his regular customers had in their possession \"The Reign of Terror\" episode 6. Campbell got in contact with the customer, bought the missing episode for £50, and then, in May 1982, donated it to the BBC through Ian Levine.\n\nIn 1984 \"Doctor Who Magazine\" (issue #87) ran a story about a rumour of a missing \"Doctor Who\" episode that was in Portsmouth; this led to episode 3 of \"The Wheel in Space\" being loaned to the BBC in April 1984 by David Stead to allow for a copy to be made. It was released on VHS in 1992, with poor results. Later, the print was borrowed again, and a new copy made, using D3 videotape. Stead recollects that he had purchased the episode for £15.\n\nIn 1982, novice film collector Gordon Hendry purchased 16 mm copies of \"The Faceless Ones\", episode 3, and \"The Evil of the Daleks\", episode 2, from a film fair in Buckingham. At that time Hendry was unaware of the episodes' value (only one episode of \"The Faceless Ones\" and none of \"The Evil of the Daleks\" were known to exist).\n\nIn 1985, a cinema owner in Brighton persuaded Hendry to lend him the films, so as to screen the episodes for profit while the Panopticon VI convention was being held in the town. Saied Marham, an associate of Hendry's, visited Panopticon to generate interest in the showing, only to be dismissed as a hoaxster, and the screening did not go ahead. So Marham kept the films to himself.\n\nAfter the event, Paul Vanezis spent 15 months attempting to retrieve the episodes from Marham. Eventually, in 1987, after Vanezis got the episodes back from Marham, a charity fundraising convention called Tellycon aired \"The Faceless Ones\", episode 3, in tribute to the recently deceased Patrick Troughton.\n\nIn the following weeks, Vanezis and Ian Levine negotiated the return of both episodes to the BBC archive.\n\nAlthough the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation received copies of \"The Crusade\", it never broadcast the story due to a prohibitive rating from the censor board. After rejecting the serial, NZBC never returned its film prints to the BBC or actively destroyed them.\n\nIn 1998 collector Bruce Grenville purchased a 16 mm copy of \"The Crusade\" episode 1 from a stall at a New Zealand film fair, containing various material previously rescued from a rubbish tip. Through a series of chance meetings, the episode eventually was returned to the BBC in January 1999.\n\nIn 1975, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation returned all eight broadcast prints of \"Galaxy 4\" and \"The Underwater Menace\" to the BBC to be disposed of. In the mid-1980s, former ITV engineer Terry Burnett purchased episode 3 of \"Galaxy 4\" and episode 2 of \"The Underwater Menace\" from another collector, unaware of their value (the only extant episode of the former serial, and one of just two from the latter). In December 2011, after a chance encounter with Doctor Who Restoration Team member Ralph Montagu, Burnett returned the episodes to the BBC.\n\n\"The Daleks' Master Plan\" was never sold abroad; only Australia requested viewing copies (excepting Episode 7, \"The Feast of Steven\"), and eventually declined to purchase the serial.\n\nThree out of the serial's 12 episodes have been recovered. 16 mm copies of episodes 5 and 10 were returned to the BBC in 1983. Episode 2 was returned in 2004 by former BBC engineer Francis Watson. He had come across the film in the 1970s, while clearing a projector testing room at the BBC's Ealing Studios. Instead of disposing of the film as instructed, he brought it home – eventually to return it to the BBC when he realised the value of the material.\n\nOf the 50 recovered episodes, several are missing short segments – due either to overseas censorship or to damage to the surviving film print. The following table shows all affected episodes, and the total duration of missing material.\nOf the 97 missing episodes, 36 are represented by short \"orphan\" clips, recovered from various sources. These clips span 17 of the 26 serials affected by missing episodes, seven of which are otherwise completely missing. The only serials lacking any footage whatsoever are \"Marco Polo\", \"Mission to the Unknown\", and \"The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve\". The following table shows all recovered excerpts, together with pertinent episodes, format of the clips, and the source of recovery. Otherwise-missing serials are in red.\n\nSome overseas viewing prints were physically edited for content by local censor boards, before transmission for reasons such as excessive violence, fright-inducing material, and, in some cases, the conservative personal views of the censors. Additionally, episodes might occasionally receive minor edits for timing reasons as well, in order to fill their allocated broadcast slot along with advertising. Hence, episodes recovered from these sources (Australia, New Zealand) are missing these segments.\n\nLater discoveries turned up a large number of excised clips, held by interested parties as proof of the edits. In October 1996, Australian \"Doctor Who\" fans Damian Shanahan and Ellen Parry discovered a collection in the records of the National Archives of Australia, provided as evidence by the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board (now the Classification Board). These clips include: \"The War Machines\", episodes 2–4; \"The Smugglers\", episodes 1, 3–4; \"The Highlanders\", episode 1; \"The Underwater Menace\", episodes 1, 4; \"The Macra Terror\", episodes 2–3; \"Fury From The Deep\", episodes 2, 4–5; and \"The Wheel In Space\", episode 4.\n\nThe clips from \"The Underwater Menace\", episode 2 were later found to precisely match the edits to the print discovered in late 2011, suggesting that the recovered episode was exactly the same print that had been censored decades before.\n\nIn an interview for the fanzine \"The Disused Yeti\", Shanahan stated that although he and Parry had found paper records relating to the censoring of early to mid William Hartnell stories, the excised portions for all stories from \"An Unearthly Child\" to \"The Gunfighters\" had been destroyed some time before Shanahan and Parry's investigation.\n\nIn 2002, New Zealand fan Graham Howard uncovered excised clips from episodes 2, 4 & 5 of \"The Web of Fear\" and episode 5 of \"The Wheel in Space\".\n\nA fan in Australia has returned small excerpts of off-screen footage, recorded from repeat showings using an 8mm cine film camera. The missing episodes covered include \"The Reign of Terror\", episode 4; \"Galaxy 4\", episode 1; \"The Myth Makers\", episodes 1–2, 4; \"The Savages\", episodes 3–4; \"The Tenth Planet\", episode 4; \"The Power Of The Daleks\", episodes 1–2; \"The Macra Terror\", episode 3; and \"The Faceless Ones\", episode 2.\n\nDue to the show's habit of repeating cliffhanger footage, sometimes missing episode material can be found in surviving neighbour episodes. Episode 2 of \"The Daleks\" uses a prefilmed reprise from the original recording of Episode 1, which later had to be remounted; the original version of Episode 1 is presumed to have been destroyed.\n\nA brief clip from Episode 4 of \"The Crusade\" exists at the very start of \"The Space Museum\". Episode 1 of the latter serial begins with the characters in period costume, briefly frozen in place. An off-camera cough heard on both soundtracks shows that the clip was a filmed insert from the previous (and currently missing) episode.\n\nIn its lead-in to an upcoming repeat, \"The Wheel in Space\" episode 6 contains a short three-frame clip from \"The Evil of the Daleks\" episode 1, alongside a reprise from the existing episode 2 of that serial.\n\nOther episodes contain straight excerpts from earlier serials, such as episode 10 of \"The War Games\", which employs model shots from the first episodes of \"Fury from the Deep\", \"The Web of Fear\" and \"The Wheel in Space\".\n\nClips from some missing episodes also survive due to their use in other surviving programmes. For example, excerpts from Episode 4 of \"The Daleks' Master Plan\" were used in a 1973 edition of \"Blue Peter\", and scenes from \"The Power of the Daleks\" in an Australian programme called \"Perspective: C for Computer\".\n\nIn 2005, two further short clips from \"The Power of the Daleks\" – along with a higher-quality version of one of the extant scenes – were discovered in a 1966 episode of the BBC science series \"Tomorrow's World\". The clips, lasting less than 10 seconds each and on film (as opposed to film recordings), came to light when the \"Tomorrow's World\" segment was broadcast as part of the edition of 11 September 2005 of the clip-based nostalgia show \"Sunday Past Times\" on BBC Two. After being alerted to the footage, Paul Vanezis of the Doctor Who Restoration Team tracked down the uncut version of the clip.\n\nThe 1977 documentary \"Whose Doctor Who\" indirectly led to a lengthy excerpt from \"Four Hundred Dawns\", episode 1 of the 1965 serial \"Galaxy 4\". The film's producers used an excerpt from a viewing print of the episode, which they further cut down in the editing. Rather than discard the unused portion, the film's advisor Jan Vincent-Rudzki asked to keep the film trims. Later in the 1990s, Vincent-Rudzki returned the clip to the archives. At a total of 5m 53s, this clip is the longest piece of surviving footage from an otherwise missing episode, accounting for a quarter of the total running time.\n\nApart from actual episode footage, rare behind-the-scenes material also was discovered for \"The Smugglers\", \"The Evil of the Daleks\", \"The Abominable Snowmen\", and \"Fury from the Deep\". Also from the latter serial exists some raw footage from the filming of Episode 6, featuring some alternative camera angles from what was eventually broadcast.\n\nAlthough numerous episodes are still missing, full-length audio soundtracks for all missing episodes are held by the BBC. These come from off-air recordings made by fans, often made by use of a microphone attached to a tape recorder placed close to the television set. While the quality of these off-air recordings varies greatly, multiple fan recordings exist for every episode.\n\nIn November 1991, Jon Pertwee recorded link narration for a planned spring 1992 cassette release of the then-missing serial \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\". However, all four episodes of \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\" were found in Hong Kong in December 1991, and returned to the BBC archive in January 1992. With the serial no longer being lost, the cassette release of the soundtrack was then delayed for a year until mid-1993, and then released due to contractual obligations. In 1992, Colin Baker recorded link narration for a cassette release of \"The Macra Terror\", while Tom Baker recorded link narration for a cassette release of \"The Evil of the Daleks\". The two coffee bar scenes from Episode 1 of \"The Evil of the Daleks\" had to be removed due to songs by The Seekers and The Beatles playing in the background. The following year in the summer of 1993, Tom Baker did first person link narration (as the Fourth Doctor recalling earlier adventures) for the cassette releases of \"The Power of the Daleks\" and \"Fury from the Deep\", a style which he also did when narrating the never-recorded bits on the 1992 VHS release of \"Shada\". This first person style of link narration was in complete contrast to his previous narration on \"The Evil of the Daleks\" cassette release, which had been done in the third person as Tom Baker.\n\nBeginning in 1999, the BBC started releasing all the serials with missing episodes on CD audiobook, with linking narration provided by former actors on the serials, such as William Russell, Peter Purves, Frazer Hines, Anneke Wills, Wendy Padbury and Carole Ann Ford, although Colin Baker's 1992 cassette link narration was reused for the 2000 CD release of \"The Macra Terror\", which left much more to the listener's imagination compared to all other CD releases of \"Doctor Who\" TV soundtrack audiobooks from 1999 to 2012. In 2012, \"The Macra Terror\" was re-released as part of the \"Collections 4\" boxset, and included new more detailed linking narration by Anneke Wills. By February 2006, the soundtracks for all of the missing episodes had been released, albeit with a copyright-uncleared music replacement of \"Paperback Writer\" by The Beatles with Hold Tight by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich in the second coffee bar scene during Episode 1 of \"The Evil of the Daleks\". On the CDs, there are also some slight pauses and slightly rejigged sequences for reasons of clarity, and with overdubbed linking narration.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2009, BBC Audiobooks released many wholly existing stories on CD audiobook, such as \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\" and \"The Ark\". These releases ceased in 2009 with \"The Ambassadors of Death\" due to declining sales, before four serials from Tom Baker's era were released in late 2012 under BBC Audiobooks' successor, AudioGo. To date, there have been no more releases of a new \"Doctor Who\" TV soundtrack on CD audiobook since \"City of Death\" in December 2012.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2013, BBC Audiobooks collected the individual narrated soundtracks in a series of five CD box sets, entitled \"Doctor Who: The Lost TV Episodes\". For the sets, some serials (such as \"The Evil of the Daleks\") were re-released with improved audio restoration. In addition to the soundtracks, the sets include special features such as the \"Archive on 4\" documentary, \"Doctor Who – The Lost Episodes\" and high-quality scans of the original camera/rehearsal scripts in PDF format.\n\nFor the first 11 seasons of \"Doctor Who\", often the surviving materials are in a very different format or condition from their original broadcast masters. Surviving 1960s material is recorded on film stock of varying quality, while early 1970s material is available in a patchwork of professional and consumer formats. To present the material in a form approximating its original broadcast masters requires extensive technical work, and a certain amount of invention.\n\nIn its original form, the videotape used to record \"Doctor Who\" captures images at 50 interlaced fields per second, resulting in a smooth, \"live\" feel to motion. To transfer the episodes to film, the film camera is timed to combine two video fields in each frame, converting 50 fields to 25 frames per second; on playback, the omission of in-between images results in a choppier \"film\" style motion. To recreate the original \"live\" video feel, early telerecorded episodes are processed through a digital tool known as VidFIRE, which approximates the missing motion between film frames.\n\nIn addition to the telerecorded material, some early 1970s material survives only, or in colour only, on NTSC videotapes produced for North American transmission (e.g., TV Ontario and CKVU in Vancouver). NTSC runs at a different frame rate from PAL video, and has a different number of scan lines. The conversion process used in the 1970s was primitive by modern standards, resulting in a noticeable amount of picture and motion loss. Converting the NTSC tapes back to PAL (\"Double Conversion\") introduces more artefacts, creating a blurry picture and juddering motion. To rectify the problem, in 2005 a new Reverse Standards Conversion process, which attempts to unpick the original video conversion, was introduced for the DVD release of \"The Claws of Axos\".\n\nSeveral early 1970s colour serials, starring Jon Pertwee, were retained only as black-and-white film prints. In addition to the motion issue shared by all telerecorded episodes, for years the loss of colour presented a major challenge for restoration.\n\nSome of the telerecorded Pertwee episodes also survive on NTSC colour videotapes, recorded over-air on consumer hardware. In the early 1990s, an early form of the Doctor Who Restoration Team attempted to pair the low-resolution colour signal from these sources with the high-resolution black-and-white signal from the black-and-white film recordings. In this way, several Jon Pertwee stories were returned to a rough form of colour: \"Doctor Who and the Silurians\", \"Terror of the Autons\", and \"The Dæmons\". Off-air NTSC colour tapes were also recovered for all of \"The Ambassadors of Death\", but were considered of too poor a quality to permit more than a partial restoration.\n\nIn 2007, BBC archive specialist James Insell established the Colour Recovery Working Group, an online project to find new ways of restoring black-and-white telerecordings to colour. In 2008, Reverse Standards Conversion inventor Richard Russell developed a technique involving the use of chroma dots embedded in the black-and-white signal to recreate the missing color. This technique was initially used as part of the recolouring process on episode 3 of \"Planet of the Daleks\"; the chroma dot process was used alongside a computer-based colourisation process to match together the differing qualities of colour recovery. The process was then used on an entire episode of \"Dad's Army\", showing that it was possible to use it on entire recordings.\n\nSubsequently, chroma dots were used to restore the colour to Episodes 2–4, 6, and 7 of \"The Ambassadors of Death\" and episodes 2–6 of \"The Mind of Evil\". Episode 1 of \"Invasion of the Dinosaurs\" presented a unique challenge, in that the chroma dots only contained red and green colour filter information, requiring that the blue filter to be added manually. Given the rough result, the DVD includes both the reconstructed colour and the black-and-white version.\n\nEpisode 1 of \"The Mind of Evil\" contains no colour information. In principle, BBC engineers were supposed to filter out the chroma dots upon telerecording, to create a cleaner picture. In most cases they failed to do so properly, allowing the colour recovery process to work. For this one episode, the filter had been correctly applied – so there was no colour to recover. To complete the serial for DVD, the episode was manually colourised by Stuart Humphryes and Peter Crocker – thereby returning the final Pertwee episode to its original colour presentation.\n\nIn addition to short video clips and audio soundtracks, for many episodes off-screen photographs − known as \"tele-snaps\" − exist, taken by photographer John Cura. From the 1940s to the 1960s, Cura was hired by various interested parties to document the transmission of many popular TV programmes, including \"Doctor Who\". Typically the photographs were used for promotion, or as keepsakes for cast and crew in the days before home video recorders. In many cases, they form the only remaining visual record of missing television programmes.\n\nSince the late 1990s, fan groups such as Loose Cannon Productions have reconstructed the missing episodes, using original camera scripts to match Cura's tele-snaps and other visual material to the surviving audio tracks. Although technically infringing copyright, these \"recons\" have generally been tolerated by the BBC, provided that they are not sold for profit.\n\n\"Official\" high-quality recons have also been used on commercial releases, including cut-down reconstructions – \"The Ice Warriors\" VHS (a 12-minute \"highlights\" reconstruction bridging the missing Episodes 2 and 3); and \"Marco Polo\" (a 30-minute reconstruction on \"The Beginning\" DVD box set) – and full-length presentations, including \"The Tenth Planet\" VHS (containing a full reconstruction of the missing Episode 4); \"Galaxy 4\" (a reconstruction of the three missing episodes to accompany the recently recovered episode 3, \"Air Lock,\" presented on \"The Aztecs\" Special Edition DVD); and \"The Web of Fear\" digital and DVD releases (containing a reconstruction of Episode 3, alongside the rest of the newly rediscovered serial).\n\nIn June 2005, BBC Audio released a reconstruction of \"The Power of the Daleks\" as part of their \"MP3 CD\" line. When played on a home PC, the disc contained the same audio content as the previous audio CD release, synchronised with a Macromedia Flash slideshow of tele-snaps and publicity photographs. For technical reasons, the surviving clips could not be included. Due to poor sales, future planned releases in this format were abandoned.\n\nIn several cases, producers of the \"Doctor Who\" DVD range have commissioned original black-and-white animation, synced to the programme's original audio tracks. Early commissions served to \"complete\" serials with only one or two missing episodes, allowing the full serials to be sold as a commercial product. Later, BBC Worldwide and BBC America commissioned a full animation of \"The Power of the Daleks\" for broadcast and commercial release.\n\nThe first such effort, Cosgrove Hall's animation of \"The Invasion\" episodes 1 and 4, was released to DVD alongside the surviving episodes in November 2006. The animation had been paid for by an earlier surplus in the \"Doctor Who\" website budget, allowing it to be used in the DVD release as a test for the concept, at no extra cost. Despite the DVD's success, the sales were not high enough to offset the animation cost for any future collaboration.\nEventually other animation studios were commissioned to continue the reconstruction. In June 2011, 2 Entertain announced that the missing episodes 4 and 5 of \"The Reign of Terror\" would be animated by Planet 55 Studios, using the \"Thetamation\" process. The serial was released on DVD in January 2013. Planet 55 would later go on to animate Episode 4 of \"The Tenth Planet\" (November 2013), and episodes 1 and 3 of \"The Moonbase\" (January 2014).\n\nIn August 2013, BBC Worldwide announced that episodes 2 and 3 of \"The Ice Warriors\" would be animated by Qurios Entertainment for a DVD release later that month.\n\nIn December 2013, 2 Entertain commissioning editor Dan Hall mentioned that Planet 55 had again been commissioned to complete \"The Underwater Menace\", for what he hoped would be an early 2014 release. However, in September 2015 \"Doctor Who\" Magazine confirmed that the much-delayed DVD, now scheduled for 26 October, was instead to contain tele-snap reconstructions of the missing episodes 1 and 4.\n\nIn September 2016 it was announced that the completely missing serial \"The Power of the Daleks\" would be animated and released via the BBC Store on 5 November 2016, the 50th anniversary of the serial's first broadcast, before it was released on DVD (21 November) and Blu-ray (6 February 2017). This is the first wholly missing serial to be completely reconstructed using animation.\n\nIn 2008, after future collaboration with Cosgrove Hall had been rejected due to expense, 2 Entertain was approached by David Busch of US animation studio Titmouse, Inc., who offered to do the work more cheaply as a result of the favourable exchange rate between the UK and the US, and put together a test trailer of scenes animated from various missing serials, including \"The Power of the Daleks\", \"The Moonbase\", \"The Macra Terror\", \"The Web of Fear\", and \"Fury from the Deep\". While 2 Entertain decided not to commission anything from Titmouse, the trailer was eventually seen by Ian Levine, who offered to try and raise the money for a full episode reconstruction to serve as a prototype. The episode chosen was \"Mission to the Unknown\", as it was a self-contained episode featuring the Daleks with a limited number of characters and sets, thus keeping the budget down. Although completed, the animated version of \"Mission to the Unknown\" has never been officially released, although it has been posted on various video streaming sites.\n\nWith the advent of ever-more-powerful home computers and more specialist programs for them, many fans are also working on unofficial animations of the missing episodes, and this is widespread with many clips being shown online.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2012, five audio box sets were released by BBC Audiobooks. The sets collected the full, unaltered soundtracks to the \"Doctor Who\" stories which did not exist in video form up to that point. A small number of the episodes included linked narration, and all of the five sets contained exclusive interviews with former cast members. The first collection was released on 5 August 2010 and the fifth was released on 1 August 2012. BBC Audiobooks–which later became AudioGo–went into administration in 2013 and ceased production officially in 2014.\nIn some cases missing episodes are bridged by narration to the camera – often by a surviving actor from the serial, occasionally in-character. For their VHS releases, \"The Reign of Terror\" and \"The Crusade\" were presented by actors Carole Ann Ford and William Russell – while Episodes 1 and 4 of \"The Invasion\" were bridged by Nicholas Courtney.\n\nIn 2012 a reimagined version of \"The Power of the Daleks\", written by, directed by, and starring Nick Scovell, was released on YouTube in three parts before it was shown complete at the \"Power:Reimagined\" convention in September 2012.\n\nIn addition the BBC has invested in the reconstruction of episodes using animation and the recreation of parts of various serials, including the completely missing \"Marco Polo\", in the docudrama \"An Adventure in Space and Time\" produced for the 50th anniversary in 2013.\n\nIn 2019 the BBC released a recreation of \"Mission to the Unknown\", which was produced by a team of students, graduates and staff of the University of Central Lancashire.\n\nBetween 1973 and 1994, each missing \"Doctor Who\" serial was novelised and published by Target Books.\n\nRichard Molesworth's \"Wiped! Doctor Who's Missing Episodes\" (Telos Publishing, 2010) explores in detail the paper trail and recovery efforts surrounding the hunt for missing episodes. A revised edition was published in March 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is the recipient of two Filmfare awards. She is known for her work in the films \"Do Badan\", \"Saathi\", \"Mera Naam Joker\", \"Siddhartha\",\"Karz\" and \"Udeekaan\" (Punjabi film).She also acted in a Bengali movie named Aranyer Dinratri directed by legendary Satyajit Ray.She is also known for her celebrity talk show, \"Rendezvous with Simi Garewal.\"\n\nGarewal was born in Ludhiana, Punjab, India. Her father, Brigadier J. S. Garewal served in the Indian Army. Simi is a cousin of Pamela Chopra, wife of film-maker Yash Chopra. Simi's mother Darshi and Pamela's father Mohinder Singh were siblings. Simi grew up in England and studied at Newland House School with her sister Amrita.\n\nAfter spending much of her childhood in England, Garewal returned to India while a teenager. Her facility with the English language induced the makers of the English-language film \"Tarzan Goes to India\" to offer her a role. A 15-year-old, Garewal made her debut alongside Feroz Khan in this film in 1962. Her performance was good enough for her to fetch many more film offers. During the 1960s and '70s, she was in several notable Indian films, working with leading directors such as Mehboob Khan's \"Son of India\", Raj Kapoor in \"Mera Naam Joker\" (1970), Satyajit Ray in \"Aranyer Din Ratri\" (\"Days and Nights in the Forest\"), Mrinal Sen in \"Padatik\" (\"The Guerilla Fighter\") and Raj Khosla in \"Do Badan.\" She starred opposite Shashi Kapoor in Columbia Pictures' \"Siddhartha\", an English-language movie based on the novel by Hermann Hesse. Garewal did a nude scene in this film which caused some controversy in India and was only released for exhibition after complying with cuts ordered by the Indian Censor board.\n. Later, in the mid-1970s, she made an appearance in the popular film \"Kabhi Kabhie\" (1976), made by her brother in-law Yash Chopra, and had a starring role in \"Chalte Chalte\" (1976). Another notable role she played was as a vamp in \"Karz\" (1980). She starred in the BBC docu-drama \"Maharajas\" (1987), based on the book by Charles Allen.\n\nIn the early 1980s, her attention turned to writing and direction. She formed her own production company, Siga Arts International. She hosted, produced and directed a TV series for Doordarshan called \"It's a Woman's World\" (1983). She also made a documentary for Channel 4 in the UK called \"Living Legend Raj Kapoor\" (1984). This was followed by a three-part documentary on Rajiv Gandhi titled \"India's Rajiv.\" She wrote and directed a Hindi feature film \"Rukhsat\" and produced television commercials, for which she won the first prize from the 1988 Pater's Award in Australia.\n\nGarewal anchored the talk show \"Rendezvous with Simi Garewal\".\n\nShe usually wears her signature white clothes on TV shows and at award ceremonies, and is popularly known as \"The Lady in White\". Garewal recently appeared on \"Say Shava Shava 2008\" as a host and judge. After the Mumbai terrorist attacks of November 2008, Simi Garewal aroused controversy by publicly calling for the Indian government to \"carpet-bomb\" the training camps in Pakistan.\n\nShe returned to television with her new talk show \"India's Most Desirable\" on Star Plus which would interview only eligible singles, Bollywood actors, business and media icons, and Indian cricketers about their \"ideal and desirable beaus\".\n\nSimi Garewal has her own website which she uses to interact with her fans: www.simigarewal.com. The site has her voice reading the text. She also has her own channel on YouTube where all her shows and documentaries are uploaded. The channel has received over 40 million views.\n\nGarewal had her first serious relationship at the age of 17, with then Maharaja of Jamnagar, who was also her neighbor in England.\n\nGarewal was later in a relationship and going steady with Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi but he broke up with her after he met Sharmila Tagore. \n\nGarewal was married to Ravi Mohan of Chunnamal family from old Delhi but her marriage was short and she is now divorced.\n\n\n\n"}

The album marked a period of significant change for the group as the band abandoned their psychedelic-oriented music for a more melodic, smooth rock/blues sound. Perhaps not coincidentally, it was also their first solid commercial success due to the strong radio-play of the title track. The title track took 19 days to record. The album reached No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and has been certified Platinum in the United States. It reached No. 1 on the Cash Box Albums Charts on January 8, 1974.\n\nThe artwork of the album is also considered amongst the greatest; for example \"Rolling Stone\" would later rank it as one of the \"Top 100 Album Covers Of All Time\".\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic rated \"The Joker\" three out of five stars, calling it \"all bright and fun, occasionally truly silly\". He also stated that it \"isn't mind-expanding\", but concluded by saying that it \"nevertheless maintains its good-time vibe so well that it's hard not to smile along...provided you're on the same wavelength as Miller, of course.\"\n\nFour tracks from the album were released as singles: \"The Joker\" (1973), \"Your Cash Ain't Nothin' but Trash\", (1974), \"Shu Ba Da Du Ma Ma Ma Ma\" (1974), and \"Evil\" (1975).\n\n\nAdditional personnel\n"}

The church is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin of Ta' Pinu. The basilica is located in open countryside which allows visitors to enjoy beautiful views of the area and is of great national importance to Gozitans everywhere.\n\nThe origins of the Shrine of Our Lady of ta' Pinu are unknown. It was first recorded in the archives of the Curia in Gozo, when the Bishop Domenico Cubelles paid a visit to the chapel. This noted that the chapel had just been rebuilt and that it belonged to the noble family of \"The Gentile\". \n\nIn 1575 the apostolic visitor Pietro Duzina was delegated by Pope Gregory XIII to visit the Maltese Islands. In his pastoral visit to the church, he found that it was in a very bad state. He ordered the church to be closed and demolished and its duties passed to the parish church, now the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Gozo. When demolition began the workman broke his arm while striking the first blow. This was taken as an omen that the chapel should not be demolished. The church was the only chapel on the island to survive Duzina's decree ordering the demolition of other similar chapels.\n\nPinu Gauci became the procurator of the church in 1598 and its name was changed from \"Of the Gentile\" to \"Ta` Pinu\", meaning \"Of Philip\". In 1611 Gauci offered money for its restoration. It was rebuilt, with a stone altar erected and investments for liturgical services provided. Gauci also commissioned the painting of the Assumption of Our Lady for the main altar. This was done in 1619 by Amadeo Perugino.\n\nIn 1883, Karmni Grima was walking past the now run down church and heard a voice asking her to recite three Hail Marys'. Over the following years miracles were attributed to the grace of Our Lady of The Assumption to whom the church was dedicated. Francis Portelli also heard the voice coming from the painting. Francis Merċieċa also known as Frenċ tal-Għarb was a devout of Our Lady of ta' Pinu and healed a lot of people in her name. \n\nThe works for the new church began on 30 May 1922 on the initiative of the church's rector Monsignor Ġużepp Portelli and was consecrated on 31 August 1932. It was built in a neo-romantic style. Inside the church there are 6 mosaics, 76 coloured windows and many ex-voto. The bell tower is 61 metres high.\n\nPope John Paul II celebrated mass on the parvise of the shrine during his visit to the island of Gozo on 26 May 1990. On 18 April 2010, when visiting Malta, Pope Benedict XVI donated and placed a Golden Rose in front of the devotional image of Our Lady Of Ta' Pinu which was brought over from Gozo to Malta for this special occasion. The Pope invited everybody to \"Pray to Her Under the Title Queen of the Family\"\n\nThe church building is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.\n\n\n"}

He played all or part of ten seasons in Major League Baseball from 1998 to 2007 for the New York Mets, Florida Marlins, Colorado Rockies, Washington Nationals, Houston Astros and St. Louis Cardinals. He is both the nephew and stepson of former New York Mets outfielder Mookie Wilson. (Mookie married Preston's mother after his brother fathered Preston.)\n\nAt age 17, Wilson was drafted by the Mets out of Bamberg-Ehrhardt High School in the first round of the 1992 amateur draft. The \"Baseball America\" 1992 High School Player of the Year, Wilson was ranked among the top 100 prospects in baseball by the magazine four times between 1993 and 1998. He is known to be an aggressive hitter, according to scouts and media sources, based on his propensity to swing at the first pitch and his high strikeout rates.\n\nAfter spending five seasons below Triple A and a season in 1998 in the Australian Baseball League with the Hunter Eagles, Wilson finally reached the majors in May 1998. Just two weeks after joining the Mets, he was traded to the Florida Marlins with two other minor leaguers for Mike Piazza. He returned to the minor leagues for most of the season.\n\nIn 1999, Wilson was the Marlins' regular center fielder. Wilson led the team in home runs and runs batted in as a rookie, and he finished second in the NL Rookie of the Year balloting to Cincinnati Reds reliever Scott Williamson. \n\nThe following season, Wilson joined the 30–30 club, slugging 31 home runs and stealing 36 bases. He added 121 RBIs, good for eighth in the National League. In 2000 he led the major leagues in power-speed number (33.3). Wilson also lived up to his reputation as a free swinger, nearly setting a new record for most strikeouts in a season. His total of 187 fell two shy of Bobby Bonds' record at the time. \n\nWilson hit 23 home runs in each of the following two seasons, though his overall production dipped, partially due to missed games.\n\nAfter the 2002 season, Wilson was involved in a six-player deal which sent him and three other players to the Colorado Rockies for Juan Pierre and Mike Hampton. Wilson rebounded in 2003, leading the National League with 141 runs batted in. He belted 36 home runs, and was named to his first All-Star team.\n\nBothered by a knee injury in 2004, Wilson was limited to 58 games.\n\nWilson was acquired by the Washington Nationals in July 2005 for pitcher Zach Day and outfielder J. J. Davis. He led the team in homers and RBIs during the second half of the season, finishing with 25 and 90 respectively.\n\nIn the 2005 offseason, Wilson signed a one-year deal worth $4 million with the Houston Astros, with a team option of three additional years at $24 million and a buyout of $500,000. Previously a center fielder, Wilson shifted to left since Willy Taveras, the previous season's Rookie of the Year runner-up, was already occupying the position.\nOn April 17, 2006, Wilson set an Astros record by striking out five times in a single game. This tied the MLB record. Despite early struggles, Wilson was batting .284 with 46 RBIs at the 2006 All-Star Break, with the potential for another 100+ RBI season. However, his power numbers were well below his previous years.\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals signed Wilson on August 18, 2006. The Cardinals took another chance on a discarded veteran since veteran center fielder Jim Edmonds was out with post concussion syndrome. Wilson was designated for assignment by Houston on Saturday, August 12, before ultimately being given his release. He joined his new team six days later and was immediately inserted into the starting lineup. Wilson batted sixth and played right field, with Juan Encarnación moving to center field. He made an instant impact for the Redbirds, hitting a home run in an 11–3 rout of the Chicago Cubs on the 18th. The Cardinals went on to become World Champions, giving Wilson a World Series ring, as his stepfather Mookie had in 1986.\n\nThe Cardinals re-signed Wilson for 2007, but he suffered a knee injury in early May and missed the rest of the 2007 season. After the end of the 2007 season Wilson was released. Wilson generated little interest during spring training 2008, leaving him a free agent.\n\nOn February 14, 2009 Wilson announced his retirement from Major League Baseball. \"My body just couldn't take it anymore\", said Wilson.\n\nOn March 21, 2009, Preston was signed by the Long Island Ducks. He played under another former New York Mets player in Gary Carter, who was the manager of the Ducks. Wilson played in 48 games for the Ducks, hitting .304 with 7 home runs, 37 RBI, a .344 on-base percentage, and a .474 slugging percentage. He did not return to the Ducks for the 2010 season, and was considering a comeback to the major leagues, but never played professionally again.\n\nWilson spent several years as an analyst for Fox Sports Florida's coverage of the Miami Marlins alongside former Marlins players Jeff Conine and Carl Pavano. In 2016, Wilson, along with Eduardo Perez and Al Leiter, served as an analyst with play-by-play man Rich Waltz. This analyst rotation come about after the Marlins fired longtime analyst Tommy Hutton after the 2015 season. Also in 2016, when his Marlins schedule did not conflict, Wilson served as an analyst for MLB Network. Additionally, Wilson hosted \"Marlins Clubhouse\", a magazine-style TV show for Fox Sports Florida. \n\nStarting in the 2018 season, Wilson worked for the AT&T Sports Network covering the Houston Astros as a field reporter.\n\n"}

Sonipat town is the district headquarters. It is a part of National Capital Region. It is bordered by Delhi, Panipat, Rohtak, Jind, Jhajjar and Baghpat (Uttar Pradesh).\n\nThe district borders Delhi union territory in south, Panipat District in the north, Jind District in the north-west, Uttar Pradesh state in the east with the Yamuna River acting as a border and Rohtak District in the west.\n\nThe district is named after its administrative headquarters, Sonipat. Sonipat was earlier known as \"Sonprastha\", which later became \"Swarnprastha\" (Golden City), which is derived from two Sanskrit words, \"Svarna\" (Gold) and \"Prastha\" (Place). Over a period of time, the classical name Swarnprastha's pronunciation degraded into \"Svarnpat\", and then to its current form, \"Sonipat\". The earliest reference of this city comes in the epic Mahabharata, and at that time, it was one of the five villages demanded by the Pandavas in lieu of the kingdom of Hastinapur.\n\nThis district was carved out of the erstwhile Rohtak district on 22 December 1972.\n\nBroadly speaking, the entire district is a part of the Punjab plain, but the area is not level in some parts. Over most of the district, the soil is fine loam of rich colour. However, some areas have sandy soil and others Kallar. The plain has a gradual slope to the south and east. The district may be roughly divided into three regions: The Khadar, the upland plain and the sandy region.\n\nAlong the River Yamuna which is a narrow flood plain ranging from 2 to 4 miles in width and is formed by the river along its course. The Khader plain is 20 to 30 ft. lower adjoining upland plain. The soil is fine clay loam left by the receding floods of the Yamuna. Farmers in the Khadar area cultivate rice and sugar cane. Recently, the farmers have started planting Banana, Pappaya and other fruits trees in this area.\n\nIt consists of Sonipat tehsil lying to the west of the Khadar, and is the most extensive of the three regions: The Upland Plain is covered with old alluvium, which if properly irrigated, is highly productive. There is extensive Farming of crops, oil seeds, horticultural plants, vegetables and flowers in this region. The ridges in Gohana tehsil represent the northern most extension of the Aravallis.\n\nA much smaller part of the district is covered with soil consisting of sand or sandy loam. Parts of this region have high PH values leading Kallor land.\n\nThe district comprises three sub-divisions: Ganaur, Sonipat, and Gohana.\n\nThey are further divided in four tehsils: Ganaur, Sonipat, Kharkhoda and Gohana. The tehsils of Kharkhoda and Sonipat fall under jurisdiction of Sonipat sub division, while tehsils of Ganaur and Gohana fall under the jurisdiction of their respective sub divisions. These are further divided into seven blocks: Ganaur, Sonipat, Rai, Kharkhoda, Gohana, Kathura and Mundlana. \n\nThe district comprises 343 villages, out of which 15 are un-inhabited.\n\nThere are six Vidhan Sabha constituencies in this district, namely, Ganaur, Rai, Kharkhauda, Sonipat, Gohana and Baroda. All of these are part of Sonipat Lok Sabha constituency. The other three Vidhan Sabha constituencies which are part of Sonipat Lok Sabha constituency, namely, Julana, Safidon and Jind are in Jind District\n\nThe district comprises a lone municipal corporation Sonipat and 3 municipal committees: Ganaur, Gohana and Kharkhoda.\nThe following villages are under the Sonipat district.\n\nThe district is one of the major education hubs in India. Apart from a number of schools and colleges, the district is home to many universities. Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram University of Science and Technology in Murthal was founded in 1987, Bhagat Phool Singh Mahila Vishwavidyalaya in Sonipat was founded in 2006 and O. P. Jindal Global University near Rathdhana was founded in 2009. Recently in 2012, National Institute of Food Technology Entrepreneurship and Management, NIFTEM, a world class institute was founded in Kundli which falls near Delhi border, SRM Institute of Science and Technology Delhi NCR Sonepat in Rajiv Gandhi Education City, Sonipat near Delhi was founded in 2013.\n\nSonipat Junction Railway Station is located on the Northern Railways' Ambala-Panipat-Delhi rail route. It lies on one of the most busiest railway line in North India that is Delhi - Chandigarh.. A number of passengers and express trains daily passes through it like Shatabadi Express, Shaan-e-Punjab, Malwa Express, Muri Express, Saryu Yamuna Express, Himalayan Queen, Sachkhand Express, Paschim Express, Kalka Mail, Jammu Mail, Unchahar Express, Amritsar Express, Jhelum Express, Tata Jat Express, Jan Shatabi, Shahid Express etc.\nIn total, 64+ trains available from Sonipat daily. National Highway 1 and National Highway 71A, NH 334B, NH 44, Western Peripheral Expressway and Eastern Peripheral Expressway pass through this district. Government of India plans to make first Bus Port in the pattern of Airport in Sonipat.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census Sonipat district has a population of 1,450,001, roughly equal to the nation of Gabon or the US state of Hawaii. This gives it a ranking of 338th in India (out of a total of 640). \nThe district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 15.71%.

The Sandur hoard of silver coins, dating to the end of the 11th century, attests to the long history of the village. In January 2020 the population stood at 532.\n\nThe Municipality of Sandur consists of the village of Sandur only. It is the most populous place on the \"Sand Island\", and is situated on a peninsula between the lakes of Gróthúsvatn in the northwest and Sandsvatn in the northeast, facing the inlets of Grótvík and Sandsvágur in the south.\n\nSandur is an old site of the thing where every year the local Várting was held. Excavations here have unearthed a stave church from the 11th century, where today there is a typical Faroese wooden church with grass roof. In 1988 the modern church suffered a devastating fire in which all of the church's silver melted. The fire turned out to be arson. In the following year the church was restored, just in time for its 150th anniversary.\nIn 1863 while extending the churchyard a treasure of silver was found consisting of 98 coins from the 11th century, half of them of German origin. Furthermore in 1989 archaeologists discovered a pagan burial ground from the times of Viking occupation. The burial included the well-preserved skeleton of a woman from the Faroe Islands in a grave 150 cm long. The grave also included three beads of amber, a blue glass bead, and a knife.\n\nIn the open-air museum of the Danish national museum close to Copenhagen one can see a water-mill which originally, in the 18th century, was installed in Sandur. The local museum Sands Bygdasavn is open in summer. It displays objects of everyday life belonging to the ancestors of the local inhabitants.\n\nSandur can be reached from Tórshavn via the ferry ports Gamlarætt and Skopun. From there along the lake Sandsvatn on Road 30 to Sandur. All villages on the island can be reached by bus from Sandur. They are therefore suitable for day trips. Due to the topography of the island walking-tours are suitable for casual strolling and cyclists. Popular trips are to Søltuvík on the west coast, Skarvanes in the south (with slightly more demanding hiking) and Húsavík on the east coast.\n\nThe small passenger only ferry MV \"Sildberin\" departs Sandur for Skúvoy, an island to the south. Particularly interesting is the tour in the Faroese rowboat \"Hvíthamar\" from Sandur to the bird rocks on the west coast or to Skúvoy. Boatbuilder Jóan Petur Clementsen himself is rowing.\n\nThe campsite \"á Munkinum\" is one of the camping sites on Sandoy. The other two camping sites are in Húsavík and Dalur. In addition Sandsvatn and Gróthúsvatn are attractive places for fishing. The Hotel Ísansgarður has been reconstructed. The tourist information in Sandur provides up-to-date information on private accommodation and holiday homes.\n\nThe Art Museum of Sandur is open from May to October every day except for Monday from 14:00-16:00. In wintertime it is open Sundays from 14:00-16:00. The museum and the art works in it were a present from Sofus Olsen. It was built in 2005 and handed over to the municipality of Sandur in December 2005, on Mr Olsen's 92nd birthday.\n\nSandur is best known for its football club, B71 Sandoy, which has enjoyed modest success in both the Faroe Islands Premier League and UEFA.\n\n\n"}

It is the only airport serving Darwin.\n\nThe airport is located in Darwin's northern suburbs, from Darwin city centre, in the suburb of Eaton. It shares runways with the Royal Australian Air Force's RAAF Base Darwin.\n\nDarwin Airport has an international terminal, a domestic terminal and a cargo terminal. Both of the passenger terminals have a number of shops and cafeterias.\n\nIn 2011 the airport served 26,036 flights and 1,743,734 passengers.\n\nIn 1919, when the England to Australia air race was announced, Parap Airfield was established in the suburb of Parap to act as the Australian terminal. It operated as two airports, a civilian airport and a military field.\n\nIt frequently took hits from Japanese bombing through the Second World War, and was used by the Allies to project air power into the Pacific. The airport hosted Spitfires, Hudson Bombers, Kittyhawks, C-47s, B-24 Liberators, B-17 Fortresses and PBY Catalinas.\n\nIn 1945 the Department of Aviation made the existing Darwin military airfield available for civil aviation purposes. As a result, the civilian airport at Parap was closed down and airport operations combined with the military airport.\n\nOn 20 April 1954, Soviet spy Evdokia Petrova defected at Darwin Airport while she was being escorted out of Australia by KGB airports.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1974 Darwin Airport acted as the primary domestic and international airport for the Northern Territory and an important stop for airlines flying between Australia and Asia and onwards to Europe. UTA, BOAC, Alitalia and Air India were some airlines that had scheduled services to Darwin. However the introduction of longer range aircraft in the 1970s meant that many airlines did not need to stop over in Darwin, and chose to cease services.\n\nCyclone Tracy hit Darwin in 1974 and flattened the city. The airport was used to ferry 25,628 people out of Darwin. Darwin Airport was extensively used to assist UN operations in East Timor from 1999, and to support medical evacuations following the 2002 Bali bombings.\n\nThe new passenger terminal, with four aerobridges, was opened in December 1991.\n\nOn 8 November 2007 it was announced that it had reached agreements for a $100 million home and lifestyle centre in Darwin Airports Business Park, which will be developed by retail developer Ticor Developments. The centre sits on eight hectares of airport land at the major intersection of Bagot Road and McMillans Road and was due for completion by the end of 2009.\n\nIn 2008 the Australian Infrastructure Fund (AIX), which holds 28.2% of Northern Territory Airports, announced that the airport would undergo a $60 million expansion to cater for growing passenger numbers. Among other improvements it would provide a 65 percent increase in terminal floor space.\n\nIn April 2009 Garuda Indonesia suspended the Denpasar service from Darwin after nearly 30 years of service, citing \"economic reasons\". The move had been protested by the Northern Territory government. The suspension left Darwin Airport without any non-Australian carriers flying there until late 2010 when Indonesia AirAsia started services from Bali to Darwin, but flights ended in January 2018.\n\n2012 and 2013 saw a major boost for Darwin Airport when foreign carriers Silk Air, Indonesia AirAsia, Philippine Airlines and Malaysia Airlines started direct flights to Singapore, Bali, Manila and Kuala Lumpur respectively. However, the increased competition from these carriers forced Jetstar to abandon its base in Darwin Airport and focus its aircraft elsewhere.\n\nOn 9 May 2015, a new expanded terminal was officially opened. The expansion, costing $85 million, increased the floor area from 16,000 to 27,000 square metres and is expected to double the capacity of the airport at peak periods. It offers expanded arrivals and departures area, four new domestic and two new international boarding gates, additional security screening areas, a larger check-in area and a new multi-use baggage reclaim area for both domestic and international arrivals. The extended terminal also features Qantas and Virgin Australia airline lounges as well as Duty Free and other retail areas.\n\nIn March 2020, Qantas briefly operated non-stop flights between Darwin and London Heathrow. Qantas flights QF1 and QF2, which normally operated between Sydney and London via Singapore, were rerouted due to air travel restrictions imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Operated by an Airbus A380, passengers remained on-board during refueling in Darwin due to the Northern Territory's border restrictions which were also imposed in response to the pandemic, before onward journey to either London or Sydney.\n\nDarwin Airport has scheduled flights to destinations in the Northern Territory, around Australia and in Southeast Asia. Only one terminal is used for both domestic and international services. The terminal has several food outlets and shops, with duty-free shopping for international travellers.\n\nDuring 2008–09 financial year a total of 1,538,938 passengers passed through Darwin International Airport which consisted of 188,530 international passengers and 1,350,408 domestic passengers.\n\nDuring the 2009–10 financial year there was a total of 1,569,007 passengers which consisted of 207,825 international passengers and 1,361,182 domestic passengers, up 2.0%.\n\nDuring the 2010–11 financial year there was a total of 1,679,899 passengers.\n\nThe head office of Airnorth is on the airport property.\n\nDarwin airport electricity needs are partially met by two photovoltaic solar arrays. Stage 1 covers six hectares near the eastern end of the main runway and generates up to 4.0MW of electricity, opened on 5 August 2016. At the time of construction it was described as the largest airside photovoltaic system in the world. Stage 2 provides a further 1.5 MW opened in December 2016 near the general aviation apron on the western side of the airport.\n\nAustralian low-cost carrier, Jetstar Airways, had expressed a keen interest in developing Darwin Airport as a hub for its trips to Asia. With the close proximity to Southeast Asia, Jetstar anticipated that it would be able to make flights using smaller aircraft, such as the Airbus A320 to fly anywhere within 4 to 5 hours from Darwin. Jetstar did eventually use Darwin as a base, with flights to Singapore, Bali, and Tokyo via Manila but was forced to cut back on them in May 2013. Flights to Bali were retained while flights to Singapore would now operate by Jetstar Asia with Singapore-based aircraft.\nNew low-cost carrier Tiger Airways had also expressed interest in making Darwin Airport its second hub; however, Tiger terminated its flights from Singapore to Darwin in October 2008, and for quite some time only operated domestic flights to Melbourne, however these flights have also now been terminated. Tiger started flights from Brisbane to Darwin after starting its Brisbane base.\n\nIn December 2010 the Federal Government approved the Darwin Airport Master Plan, a 20-year blueprint of how the airport will be affected by and manage issues such as aviation growth and the rise of Darwin Airport as an international transit point between Europe, Asia and Australia.\n\n\n\n"}

It has been running for about a decade. This show was inspired by the 1997 British film \"Full Monty\".\n\n\"Sólo Para Mujeres\" came after the success of its predecessor, \"Sólo Para Hombres\" (\"For Men Only\"), a play that starred Lorena Herrera, among others, and which came about after Herrera's participation in the famous telenovela, \"Dos Mujeres, un Camino\". \"Sólo Para Hombres\" featured Herrera and other famous Mexican actresses dancing on stage with scant outfits. \"Sólo Para Mujeres\" followed the same lines: muscular actors would dance, for an audience that consists mainly of women, wearing underwear only or suggestive clothing.\n\nAlthough Televisa is not directly connected with the play, many of the actors on \"Sólo Para Mujeres\" have had previous experience acting in soap operas for the largest Mexican television network. Among those are Alexis Ayala, Jorge Salinas, Sergio Sendel, Alfonso de Nigris and the play's producer, Sergio Mayer. Former Menudo Johnny Lozada also participated at the play for a number of years.\n\nThe play was not expected to be as successful as \"Sólo Para Hombres\" was: Mexico, as with most of Latin America, still has a society with relatively machista views, and so the first expectations for \"Sólo Para Mujeres\" were that it would last, at most, a couple of years. The play managed, however, to outlast \"Sólo Para Hombres\".\n\nSolo Para Mujeres The Movie is upcoming Philippine Musical family romantic, comedy, drama, directed by Theodore Boborol.

Among some publicly expressed doubts are the fact that the street had not been closed before the filming of the video, and also that the members of \"Sólo Para Mujeres\" were not provided with protective helmets before getting on their motorcycles. Also, driving motorcycles on the street where the tragedy happened is prohibited by the law.\n\nMembers of the play declared that it was not of their knowledge that driving motorcycles was prohibited on the particular street where the tragedy happened, because they had passed there on their bikes before and no one had admonished them for it. On the other hand, the man who drove the car into the motorcycles was released on bond until the case is seen at a Mexican court. Mayer demonstrated great displeasure when given the news that that man was not in jail anymore.\n\nThis show is currently touring the US with presentations in Atlanta, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Arizona and Miami.\n\n"}
{"id": "1889705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889705", "title": "Agacher Strip War", "text": "Agacher Strip War\n\nThe Agacher Strip War was a war fought by Burkina Faso and Mali over a long strip of land located in the northern Burkina Faso province of Oudalan. The area, thought to contain considerable amounts of natural gas and mineral resources, was the center of a long-term border dispute between the two countries that erupted into an armed conflict on two occasions (in 1974 and 1985).\n\nBoth Mali and Burkina Faso thought that the Agacher Strip contained substantial natural resources and hoped that these resources would help improve their dire economic situations.\n\nSome observers believe that the dispute may have been deliberately provoked to divert attention from domestic problems brought on by the return of military rule in Burkina Faso (then Upper Volta) and the growing unpopularity of Moussa Traoré's military regime in Mali.\n\nThe dispute between the two countries first erupted into an armed conflict on November 25, 1974. The conflict involved only a few border skirmishes with exchanges of small arms-fire in late November and mid-December 1974. Notably, there was a lack of military operations and significant fighting; casualties on both sides were minimal.\n\nAs tensions escalated, mediation efforts by President Gnassingbé Eyadéma of Togo and President Seyni Kountché of Niger to resolve the conflict proved unsuccessful. Sporadic clashes continued into early 1975 with numerous reprisals against Malians in Upper Volta, prompting the Organization of African Unity to create a commission to mediate the crisis. The organization recommended that a neutral technical commission be created to demarcate the boundary. Both countries accepted this proposal at a meeting held on June 18, 1975, in Lomé, Togo.\n\nBeginning in 1977, Upper Volta and Mali engaged in political mediation through the \"Non-Aggression and Defense Aid Agreement\" (ANAD), a regional West African group.\n\nIn 1983, military captain Thomas Sankara seized power in Burkina Faso in a coup and was tasked with resolving the country's many problems, including the Agacher Strip dispute. Negotiations between Sankara, Malian President Traoré, and the countries' top diplomats were strained. Additionally, under Sankara's rule, Burkina Faso expelled Drissa Keita, a Malian diplomat, further deteriorating bilateral relations. Some Burkina Faso newspapers accused Mali of preparing an invasion; Mali rejected the accusations and accused Burkina Faso of escalating tensions.\n\nBy 1985, both countries experienced several years of drought. Rainfall finally arrived in late 1985 but washed out the roads, hindering the distribution of food and medical supplies to the Agacher region. During this period, the Burkina Faso government organized a nationwide census. The census agents visited Fula camps in Mali, which sparked outrage from the Malian government, who saw it as a violation of their sovereignty. Reports about Burkina Faso ground troops present in the Agacher Strip also upset Mali because, although Burkina Faso believed they had sovereignty over the area, no formal deal had been made up to that point. Traoré publicly denounced the act and campaigned for African leaders to pressure Sankara. However, the Burkina Faso soldiers did not leave the area, escalating tensions further.\n\nOn December 25, 1985, the Malian military launched several ground attacks against Burkina Faso border posts and police stations. The Burkina Faso army responded by mobilizing soldiers in the region and launching counterattacks. However, the Malian army, which was better prepared and organized, conducted many successful assaults that captured several of the villages and outposts. The Libyan government attempted to negotiate a ceasefire on December 26, but negotiations failed. The war culminated in an airstrike by the Malian Air Force on a marketplace in Ouahigouya, in which a number of civilians were killed. A second ceasefire instigated by the governments of Nigeria and Libya on December 29 also failed. The countries agreed to a third ANAD-sponsored truce on December 30, finally ending what became known as the \"Christmas War.\" Estimates of the total number of casualties from the war range from 59 to 300 people.\n\nIn mid-January 1986, at a \"Non-Aggression and Defense Aid Agreement\" summit in Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast, presidents Moussa Traoré of Mali and Thomas Sankara of Burkina Faso agreed to withdraw their troops to pre-war positions. Prisoners of War were exchanged in February and full diplomatic relations were restored in June. Despite this, the dispute remained unresolved. The case was taken to the International Court of Justice.\n\nIn the ICJ's judgement delivered on December 22, 1986, the court split the of disputed territory almost equally. Mali received the western portion and Burkina Faso the eastern. President Traoré called the settlement \"very satisfying\" and a victory for the \"brother peoples\" of Mali and Burkina Faso.\n"}

{"id": "1889718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889718", "title": "Dudley Square station", "text": "Dudley Square station\n\nDudley Square (variously known as Dudley Station, Dudley Street Terminal, or simply Dudley) is a ground-level bus station located in Nubian Square (formerly Dudley Square) in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It is a transfer point between 18 Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) bus routes, including two Silver Line bus rapid transit lines and 16 local MBTA Bus routes. Like all MBTA bus stops, Dudley is fully accessible. The station will be renamed Nubian Square station in 2020, following the 2019 renaming of the square.\n\nDudley was originally opened in 1901 as a BERy Main Line Elevated station. The last segment of the original Main Line Elevated, the Washington Street Elevated (including Dudley station), closed in 1987; six years later, Dudley was converted into its modern configuration. Silver Line service began in 2002.\n\nDudley is a contributing property in the Dudley Station Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\n\nThe Boston Elevated Railway opened its Main Line Elevated on June 10, 1901. The line ran from Sullivan Square on the Charlestown Elevated, through the Tremont Street subway, and on the Washington Street Elevated to a southern terminal located at Dudley Square. Along with the rest of the Washington Street Elevated, Dudley Street Terminal was designed by Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr.. It featured a Beaux Arts-style waiting area, clad in copper with an internal arched structure.\n\nLike many BERy stations, Dudley Street Terminal was designed for efficient transfers between streetcars and subway trains. Many streetcar routes that had operated to downtown (some into the Tremont Street subway) were curtailed to Dudley, where two elevated loops offered cross-platform transfers to Main Line trains, using platforms on both sides of the northbound track. Other streetcars - largely on crosstown routes that did not terminate at Dudley - stopped at street-level platforms underneath the elevated station.\n\nThe Washington Street Elevated was extended south to Forest Hills on November 22, 1909. The loop allowing trains to return downtown from Dudley was kept (as some trains were short-turned at Dudley), and a new southbound platform was added. In 1910, the elevated streetcar loops were expanded and roofed to handle larger-than-expected crowds. Dudley quickly became overcrowded; in 1917, a streetcar transfer area was built at Egleston to the south and some streetcar routes diverted there.\n\nAs streetcar routes were bustituted during the 1940s and 1950s, the streetcar platforms were modified for use by buses and trackless trolleys. The east loop was completely rebuilt over a six-month period for trolleybus operations, reopening on December 25, 1948. The Main Line Elevated was renamed the Orange Line in 1967.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1987, the Southwest Corridor was rebuilt, with 2 Orange Line and 3 commuter rail tracks in a trench replacing a 4-track embankment. Trains last ran on the Elevated on April 30, 1987, and the relocated Orange Line opened on May 4, 1987.\n\nEven without the Elevated, Dudley Square remained a major bus transfer location. After several years, the former Elevated station was converted into a new bus station. The station building was lowered to the ground and rolled to the south. The original station building covers north–south oriented bus platforms A, B, and C; new shelters in a similar style were built for east–west platforms D, E, and F. When completed in late 1993, the new Dudley Square bus station served over 10,000 daily passengers, with over 100 buses per hour stopping at peak times.\n\nWhen the Washington Street Elevated was removed, the MBTA originally promised to run light rail service over its former route. After 15 years of debate and changing plans, the Washington Street section of the Silver Line bus rapid transit system opened on July 20, 2002. It ran between Dudley and Downtown Crossing, replacing the 49 bus (albeit with increased frequency and other rapid-transit-like features). On October 13, 2009, this service was re-designated the SL5; a new SL4 service was added between Dudley and South Station, sharing most of the route of the SL4.\n\nDudley Square was also a proposed stop on the MBTA's planned Urban Ring Project. The Urban Ring was to be a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Line designed to connect the current MBTA Lines to reduce strain on the downtown stations. The project is currently shelved due to financial difficulties and questions about spending priorities.\n\nThe closing of the Washington Street Elevated in 1987, which also closed the Dudley Square elevated station, prompted a 2012 review; the \"Roxbury-Dorchester-Mattapan Transit Needs Study\", recommended for some form of proposed replacement rail service to access southern Metro Boston neighborhoods—one option being studied within this review would re-use the Tremont Street subway's now-unused southern Pleasant Street tunnel coming from the Green Line's Boylston station to eventually run a light rail line to, and likely beyond Dudley Square to the south. The new light rail service proposed in the 2012 review, to replace the rapid transit access the Elevated previously provided, could go from Dudley Square as far south as the Red Line's Mattapan station, with a northern turnaround terminus at Government Center.\n\nWith the December 2019 renaming of Dudley Square to Nubian Square, community leaders stated they would seek to have the station renamed. In February 2020, the MBTA agreed to rename the station to Nubian Square.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1889729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889729", "title": "Disneyland, Inc.", "text": "Disneyland, Inc.\n\nDisneyland, Inc. (DLI) was a corporation formed to finance, build and run Disneyland park in Anaheim, California.\n\nDisneyland, Inc. was incorporated in the State of California in 1951 by Walt Disney. A companion company owned only by Walt Disney originally called Walt Disney, Incorporated then WED Enterprises (WED) was set up in 1952 supposedly only for television production, but was used to design Disneylandia and its attractions. As the board of directors of Walt Disney Productions (WDP) was questionable in its support for the project. In March 1953, WDP board of directors agreed to Walt Disney's personal services contract and WED's contracts for designing and building Disneyland park attractions for cost plus overhead with three board directors resigning.\n\nThe Stanford Research Institute was hired in April 1953 to determine the best park location and an amusement parks and public attractions analysis for US$32,000 while WED started designing Disneylandia with Bill Martin signing on to do so. By July, Disney directed the institute to look at 100+ acre Southern California location. Also that month, one of the Disney brothers had an initial meeting with American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres's Leonard H. Goldenson about Disneyland financing for Disney Production film inventory.\n\nRoy met in August 1953 with the Stanford Research Institute over the Disneylandia location survey's 10 possible location settling on an area along the Santa Ana Freeway in Anaheim. Soon, a 160-acre grove of orange trees, the Ball Road subdivision, was purchased for US$879 thousand. An additional 270 acres were purchased for the site by a real estate agent, followed by a separate purchase of 244 more acres.\n\nThe first park diagram plan was completed by Marvin Davis on August 8, 1953 with Walt adding the triangular space bounding the park for the railroad. On September 25, Davis finished his second version design with the hub layout. On the following day Walt and Herb Ryman started a 42-hour period in which they drew a 43x70 inch detailed aerial view. During the year, Key Disney staff members toured major American amusement parks to find out what does not work.\n\nWith the WED concept designs and prospectus for Disneyland, Roy Disney in September 1953 met with TV networks CBS and NBC in a deal for Disney-produced TV show and Disneyland investment. Both showed interest in the TV shows but not for the Disneyland investment. Roy then approached American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres's Goldenson, who had pursued Disney for programming before, who agreed to the Disneyland, Inc. investment as the risk to make ABC a major network. Just a week after Disney set a record for receiving 4 Oscars on March 29, 1954, the ABC-Paramount board approved the Disney deal. Despite some WDP board resistance, WDP board approve the agreement which was signed on April 2.\n\nAmerican Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres (AB-PT) agreed to invest $500,000 in Disneyland, Inc. taking a 34.49 percent and guaranteeing $4.5 million in bank loan plus a weekly TV programming for ABC from Walt Disney Productions. Joining AB-PT as Disneyland investors were Walt Disney Productions, Western Publishing and Walt Disney. The other shares were 34.48% by Walt Disney Productions (US$500,000 investment), 13.8% by Western Printing and Lithography Co (US$200,000 investment), 16.55% by Walt Disney (US$250,000 investment). Walt Disney Productions had the option to repurchase the Walt Disney, WED and Western Publishing shares (31%) by May 1, 1959 for $562,500. WED held ownership of the Disneyland Railroad.\n\nDisneylandia was announced that in April 1954 by Walt to be opened in July 1955. While some time in 1954, Walt at the urging of ABC TV, the park's name was changed from Disneylandia to Disneyland.\n\nWith a need for a hotel nearby and no funding available for Disney to build it, Walt Disney approached Hilton and Sheraton Hotels about building such a hotel. Both turned down Disney as they had no idea where Anaheim was. Disney began approach prospective investors for the Disneyland Hotel in 1954 which included Jack Wrather who agreed. Wrather-Alvarez Hotels, Inc. was expected to have the hotel opened in .\n\nAB-PT's subsidiary, UPT Concessions, Inc. was enlisted to operate Tomorrowland's Space Bar (original name Stratosnak) and various other concession stands in Disneyland. On , the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway was one of many companies that sponsored attractions in the park with its 5-year sponsorship of all Disneyland trains and stations at the park's opening agreed.\n\nRear Admiral Joseph W. Fowler was hired in April 1954 as senior vice president for engineering and construction to oversee building Disneyland. Work began on the site in July with the removal of the first orange tree. A 1955 strike by the Orange County plumbers and asphalt workers puts the Disneyland building schedule in jeopardy.\n\nOn July 17, 1955 at 2 PM, the Disneyland park with Five themed \"lands\" containing eighteen attractions opened. 15 thousand guests were invited to the opening event, but it is believed that 28 to 33 thousand came to the park. The total construction cost came to $17 million.\n\nBy 1955, WDP had advanced DLI $2.4 million. WDI also took out its AB-PT guaranteed bank loan for $4.4 million in installment payments with the final payment in April 1962. The loan is secured by Disneyland real and certain personal properties, leasehold and the TV programming contract revenue which if Disneyland defaults AB-PT may purchase the loan. On , Disney Production exercised its options to purchase all but AB-PT's common stock outstanding. This allowed WDP to consolidate DLI into its 1957 annual accounting statements adding four months worth of net profits, $511K.\n\nBy 1958, Walt Disney Productions reported a profit of $2.9 million, primarily attributable to its by then 65% interest in Disneyland, Inc. Additionally, Walt Disney Productions stock (which moved the year prior to the New York Stock Exchange) had grown to around $60 per share thanks to the growing realization by the financial markets of the profitability of the park.\n\nOn , the WED owned Disneyland-Alweg Monorail System is installed in Tomorrowland.\n\nIn June 1960, Walt Disney Productions completed the purchase of AB-PT's share of the company for nearly $7.5 million and its TV contract, and the theme park became a fully owned part of Walt Disney Productions. April 25, 1961 Walt Disney Productions and Disneyland, Inc. was able to pay off all existing loans.\n\nFinally, in 1982, the Disney family sold the naming rights and rail-based attractions, owned then by Retlaw Enterprise (formerly WED), to the Disney film studio for 818,461 shares of Disney stock then worth $42.6 million to the Disney family. Then, Disneyland Inc. was acquired by Walt Disney World Company in 1990s.\n\nThe investment contract for Disneyland with American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres included programming for ABC TV, which paid $5 million per year during 7-year contract and is the largest TV package deal in history.\n\n"}
{"id": "1889736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889736", "title": "Sebastián Piñera", "text": "Sebastián Piñera\n\nMiguel Juan Sebastián Piñera Echenique (; born 1 December 1949) is the sitting President of Chile since 2018, having previously served from 2010 to 2014.\n\nThe son of a Christian democratic politician and diplomat, he studied business engineering at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and economics at the Harvard University. He had an estimated net worth of 2.8 billion dollars in 2019 according to \"Forbes\", making him one of the richest people in Chile.\n\nA member of the centre-right National Renewal party, he served as a senator for the East Santiago district from 1990 to 1998, running for the presidency in the 2005 election, which he lost to Michelle Bachelet, and again, successfully, in 2010. As a result, he became the first right-wing president to be democratically elected since 1958, and the first to hold the office since the departure of Augusto Pinochet in 1990.\n\nPiñera is the sixth child of the marriage between José Piñera Carvallo and Magdalena Echenique Rozas. Among his ancestors on his maternal side is his mother's great-great-grandmother, Luisa Pinto Garmendia, the sister of President Aníbal Pinto Garmendia and daughter of President Francisco Antonio Pinto and Luisa Garmendia Alurralde, who was a descendant of the penultimate Inca emperor, Huayna Capac. He is a nephew of the oldest living Roman Catholic bishop in the world, Bernardino Piñera.\n\nPiñera's family moved to Belgium one year after his birth and later to New York City, where his father was the Chilean ambassador to the United Nations. Piñera returned to Chile in 1955 and enrolled in the Colegio del Verbo Divino (\"Divine Word College\"), from which he graduated in 1967.\nPiñera then matriculated at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, from which he graduated in 1971 with an undergraduate degree in commercial engineering. Upon graduation, he was awarded the Raúl Iver Oxley Prize, which is given to the best overall student of each class.\nPiñera continued on to Harvard University on a partial Fulbright Program for postgraduate studies in economics. During his time at Harvard, Piñera and a classmate coauthored an article, \"The Old South's Stake in the Inter-Regional Movement of Slaves\", for the \"Journal of Economic History\". After three years at Harvard, Piñera graduated with both an M.A. and Ph.D. in Economics.\n\nPiñera was an economics lecturer from 1971 until 1988 at the University of Chile, the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, and Adolfo Ibáñez University. In 1971, he was in charge of Economic Political Theory in the School of Economics at the University of Chile and in 1972, at the Valparaiso Business School.\n\nIn 1989, with Cecilia Morel, Danica Radic, and Paula Délano, Piñera created the Enterprising Women Foundation (\"Fundación Mujer Emprende\"), originally called The House of Youth (\"La Casa de la Juventud\"). The foundation aims to assist in the development of young women of lower income.\n\nIn 1973, Piñera created the foundation \"Fundación Futuro\", of which he is president and whose directors are Cristián Boza D., María Teresa Chadwick P., Hugo Montes B., Cecilia Morel M., Renato Poblete S.J., and Fabio Valdés C. The head director of the foundation is Magdalena Piñera. The foundation's mission is to help in Chile's development of justice, freedom and democracy. The foundation was renamed \"Fundación Cultura y Sociedad\" after Piñera was elected president.\n\nUnder the \"Fundación Cultura y Sociedad\" (formerly \"Fundación Futuro\"), the \"Grupo Tantauco\" has the mission of environmentalism, and is administered by Juan Carlos Urquidi. It was created to support the proposals Piñera plans to institute during his presidency. In 2005, Piñera created Tantauco Park (Spanish: \"Parque Tantauco\"), a 1,180 km2 (456 sq mi) private natural reserve he bought and owns on the south end of Chiloé Island, in order to protect 118,000 hectares of the region's unique ecosystem. His foundation runs the park, which is open to the public and is an ecotourist location.\n\nIn fact, Piñera bought the 118,000 hectares in Chiloé through an offshore company in Panama. He has faced pressure to cede eight hectares to 16 indigenous families whose presence pre-dates Piñera's purchase and who have spent years negotiating to obtain title to their familial lands.\n\nAn additional project, \"Grupo Tantauco: Derechos Humanos\", was proposed in hopes of beginning a reconciliation between the Chilean people who suffered human rights violations during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship.\n\nPiñera was general manager of the Banco de Talca. In 1982, a warrant was issued for his arrest on charges of violating banking law. Piñera spent 24 days in hiding while his lawyers appealed the order. A writ of habeas corpus, first rejected by the Appeals Court but then approved by the Supreme Court, acquitted Piñera.\n\nPiñera once owned 90% of Chilevisión (a terrestrial television channel broadcasting nationwide). He also owned 27% of LAN Airlines (LAN); 13% of Colo-Colo, a football (soccer) club; and other minor stock positions in companies such as Quiñenco, Enersis, and Soquimich.\n\nIn July 2007, Piñera was fined approximately US$680,000 by Chile's securities regulator (SVS) for not withdrawing a purchase order after receiving privileged information (an infraction similar to insider trading) of LAN Airlines stock in mid-2006. Later that month, he resigned from the boards of LAN and Quintec.\n\nTo avoid a conflict of interest he sold Chilevisión for $160 million in 2010 to Time Warner. He also sold his shares of LAN in several rounds between February and March 2010, as well as his stake in Colo-Colo.\n\nPiñera has built an estimated fortune of $US2.8 billion , according to \"Forbes\" magazine. His wealth is greatly due to his involvement in introducing credit cards to Chile in the late 1970s and his subsequent investments, mainly in LAN Airlines stock. Piñera acquired shares of the formerly state-owned company from Scandinavian Airlines in 1994, as part of a joint venture with the Cueto family.\n\nIn 1988 as Pinochet had lost the referendum and Chile was returning to democracy Piñera offered his support for the Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle in his pre-candidacy for president.\n\nIn 1998, Piñera opposed the arrest and detention of Augusto Pinochet, in London, initiated by Baltasar Garzón, arguing that it was an attack on the sovereignty and dignity of Chile.\n\nOn 14 May 2005, in a surprise move Piñera announced his candidacy for the 2005 presidential election (RN was supposed to support UDI's Lavín.) He has described his political philosophy as Christian humanism.\n\nPiñera ran for President of Chile in the 2009–2010 election. Since August 2009, he led in opinion polls, competing with Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, Marco Enríquez-Ominami and Jorge Arrate; all of whom are left-of-center candidates. In 13 December 2009 election, Piñera placed first in the results with 44.05% of the votes, while Frei placed second with 29.6% of the votes. Neither candidate received more than half of the total votes; therefore, according to the Constitution, Chileans returned to the polls for a final run-off election on Sunday, 17 January 2010.\n\nThat evening, the third and final preliminary results were announced by the Deputy Interior Ministry. These showing accounted for 99.77% of the total ballot boxes. Of the votes, Piñera received 51.61% and Frei received 48.39%.\nPiñera invested an estimated 13.6 million USD in his presidential campaign, which included items such as a campaign anthem and \"Thank You\" banners. Piñera's banners and billboards have carried statements throughout the country such as \"Delinquents, your party is over,\" and \"Small businesses, Big opportunities\". Piñera's campaign released a featuring a male gay couple, something never seen before in a presidential campaign run in Chile. Amongst his promises were increasing education rates and improving international relations with the neighboring country of Perú.\n\nPiñera's victory meant a shift towards the right, breaking two-decades of center-left political leadership and becoming the first elected right-wing leader in 52 years.\n\nOn 28 January, Piñera suspended his membership in National Renewal, becoming unofficially an independent. RN's bylaws require successful presidential candidates from the party to renounce their association in order to govern the country fairly, foremost with the interest of the people, not with the interest of a political party or particular political philosophy.\n\nPiñera became the first billionaire to be sworn into the Chilean Presidency. He offered to sell his shares in major corporations before being sworn in on 11 March 2010, in order to avoid conflicts of interest. Piñera has placed US$400 million in blind trusts.\n\nThe Monday following Piñera's election, expectations of sale from his largest holdings created a surge in trade of Axxion and LAN shares, causing three brief suspensions (19–20, 22 January 2010) in the Santiago Stock Exchange in order to ease trade. Axxion shares more than tripled before falling 39% on Friday, 22 January. Bachelet's Finance Minister Andrés Velasco urged Piñera to get the sale \"sorted out quickly.\" The value of Piñera's interest in Axxion was estimated at 700 million dollars USD, of his 1.2 billion dollar USD fortune at the beginning of that week.\n\nOn 5 February, Piñera confirmed plans to sell his 26.3% stake in LAN airlines at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting for his main holding company, Axxion. Under the pact, Axxion shareholders have agreed to fix the price of the sale, estimated at US$1.5 billion. The Cueto family, who at that point held 25.5% of LAN through their holding company \"Costa Verde Aeronáutica\", had the first option to purchase the stake. On 18 February, Axxion posted a statement on their website confirming the sale of a 21.18% stake in LAN Airlines to the Cueto family for US$1.23 billion. Announcement regarding the sale of the remaining shares was pending until March 2010, when the whole package left Piñera's hands.\nPiñera sold his 9.7% stake in the upscale private hospital \"Clinica Las Condes\" at a price of 25,113 CLP per share (US$48.00) through his holding company Bancard on Tuesday, 16 February. The total sale of the 792,000 shares grossed US$37.85 million and was purchased by the brokerage firm \"Celfin\". The proceeds from the sale will go to paying off Bancard debt.\n\nPiñera announced on February he had the intention to transfer 100% of his stake in Chilevisión to a non-for-profit organization called \"Fundación Cultura y Sociedad\" (formerly \"Fundación Futuro\"), of which he is owner. The foundation's board will include some of the station's current executives. Under that proposal, Piñera maintains the right to remove and replace the foundation's president at any given time. Cristián Patricio Larroulet Vignau, current Minister of the Secretariat of the Presidency of Chile, stated that Piñera was honoring his promise of removing himself from private corporations, as Chilevision will become the property of a non-profit organization. MP Cristián Monckeberg (RN), stated there is no law obligating Piñera to do otherwise and thus this decision is legally legitimate.\"\". The option above finally did not take place, Piñera decided to sell the TV station, and after a failed attempt in May 2010 with the Linzor Capital investment fund, the President announced it sold Chilevisión to Time Warner, in late August 2010.\n\nPiñera said he won't sell his 12.5% stake in \"Blanco y Negro\", company that owns the nation's popular soccer team Colo-Colo. He has stated, \"We want big things and not only achieve local victories. The idea is to return the Copa Libertadores to Chile. That is our great goal.\" Although he will remain part owner, he will take no administrative duties or role while President.\n\nPiñera announced what he calls his \"cabinet of unity\" on Tuesday, 9 February 2010, at 18:00 hours (local time), in Chile's National Historical Museum. The list of names was presented the previous day to the leader of the National Renewal Party, Carlos Larraín, and the leader of the Independent Democratic Union, Juan Antonio Coloma. The cabinet is made up of 16 men and 6 women, with an average age of 49. Amongst Piñera's nominees is Jaime Ravinet, who is defense minister of the current president's cabinet and a former member of the Christian Democratic Party, from which he resigned upon accepting Piñera's cabinet offer. Also a nominee is Cristián Larroulet, who was an economic planning adviser under Pinochet.\n\nDuring his first official meeting with his Council of Ministers on Wednesday, 10 February, Piñera issued a formal memorandum calling upon all members to renounce their positions in all private companies by 28 February in order to avoid conflicts of interest. The memorandum also said that in regards to national heritage, secretaries of state whose affiliation with companies having direct receipt of fiscal monies must either remove themselves from those associations or honor the restrictions of their competitors. Ten of his 22 ministers have involvement in companies with significant financial means.\n\nOn 17 December 2017, Sebastián Piñera was elected president of Chile for a second term. He received 36% of the votes, the highest percentages among all 8 candidates in the 2017 elections. In the second round, Piñera faced Alejandro Guillier, a television news anchor who represented Bachelet's New Majority (Nueva Mayoría) coalition. Piñera won the elections with 54% of the votes.\n\nPiñera was sworn in as the 34th President of the Republic of Chile on 11 March 2010, in a ceremony held in a plenary session of the National Congress in Valparaíso. In the same ceremony, Piñera's Cabinet ministers were sworn in. The ceremony was also marked by a 6.9 M earthquake and subsequent aftershocks that upset the invitees. Shortly after, the National Congress building was evacuated due to a tsunami alert that proved to be false a couple of hours later. On 12 October 2010, Piñera rallied his countrymen in the rescue of 33 trapped miners, all of whom were rescued after 70 days following a mining accident. \"Chile will never be the same\", he said to the miners' foreman, Luis Urzúa, as he (the last of the miners to emerge from the cavern) greeted Piñera, in a broadcast carried live across the globe. Despite much goodwill in Chile following this, many Chileans are still waiting on Piñera to rectify anti-terrorism laws in Chile which effectively mean the indigenous Mapuche people can be dealt with as \"terrorists\". This matter has led to hunger strikes which started before the mining disaster, and are set to continue afterwards.\n\nIn January 2011 he faced the protest in Magallanes Region in response to a proposed increase in the price of natural gas there by 16.8%. The protests left more than two thousand cars isolated while trying to cross from the Argentine province of Tierra del Fuego to the province of Santa Cruz through Chilean territory. Another 1,500 tourists were left without movement in Torres del Paine National Park after routes to Puerto Natales and El Calafate were cut. In consequence, on 14 January, Minister Secretary General of Government Ena von Baer announced changes in Sebastián Piñera's government cabinet, including the resignation of Ricardo Raineri as Energy Minister. Laurence Golborne became Mining and Energy Minister, on 16 January.\n\nIn March 2011, President Piñera led a state visit to Spain to boost relations between the two countries. While in Spain, President and Mrs Piñera, with Prince Felipe and Princess Letizia, opened the exhibition ”Don Qui. El Quijote de Matta”, at the Cervantes Institute of Madrid.\n\nAmidst the severe 2011 Chilean student protests Piñera shuffled his cabinet and removed Joaquín Lavín from the post of minister of education. With respect to the protest, Piñera has defended for-profit activity in education and proposed to legalize it, rejecting the students' demands for the public ownership of educational establishments. During August 2011, Piñera's public approval declined precipitously amidst continuous protests, to the extent that some polls indicated that he was the least popular Chilean leader since Augusto Pinochet. His approval ratings dropped to as low as 22% according to a CERC survey. As such, Piñera's chances of passing sought reforms were seen as remote.\n\nAs president, Piñera expressed support for the Argentine claim on the Falkland Islands, referring to \"the unrenounceable rights of Argentina on the islands\".\n\nIn March 2012, Piñera visited Vietnam with the intention of increasing cooperation between the two countries in general and with Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's most populous and largest economic hub, in particular. HCM City also called for a Chilean sister city while receiving Piñera on 23 March. The visit included the signing of a bilateral trade agreement and several cooperation pacts in education, tourism, culture and finance.\n\nEarly in 2012 physicist Frank Duarte sharply criticized Piñera's performance in the handling of the Chilean–Peruvian maritime dispute at The Hague, deemed as favoring commercial interests over the interest of the Chilean people, and called for Chile's withdrawal from The Hague. Following the adverse ruling against Chile in 2014, several political figures in Chile, from a variety of political parties, also called for Chile's withdrawal from The Hague that would, in addition, imply a withdrawal from the Pact of Bogota.\n\nIn December 2011 during a state visit to Mexico a joke made by Piñera where he compared women with politicians caused uproar in Chile, sparking criticism from his own minister Carolina Schmidt who said of the joke that it was \"hurting to many women\". In the joke Piñera said that \"when a lady says \"no\" it means maybe, when she says maybe it means yes and when she says yes she is not a lady.\" The Chilean Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence called the joke \"misogynic\" and \"a shame for the whole country\". Previously on a state visit to Peru in 2011 Piñera received criticism for his informal style after he revealed to Peruvian president-elect Ollanta Humala that he was a descendant of the Inca Huayna Capac. Senator Jorge Pizarro criticized Piñera's comment to Ollanta Humala, calling for more careful and respectful attitudes.\n\nOn 17 December, Piñera won the second round of the Chilean General election, defeating the left wing candidate Alejandro Guillier to become President-Elect. Piñera took office for a second time on 11 March 2018, succeeding the outgoing Michelle Bachelet.\n\nEnvironmental NGOs accuse the government of yielding to pressure from the mining lobby in an attempt to thwart any draft legislation. In 2018, Sebastián Piñera buried an initiative to ban industrial activities near glaciers. In 2019, a draft law from the ranks of the opposition caused tensions. It is supposed to convert glaciers and their surrounding environment \"into protected areas, prohibiting any intervention except scientific and that can benefit sustainable tourism\". At least 44 mining projects are likely to be completed between 2019 and 2028.\n\nIn May 2018, his government adopted \"The Women's Agenda\" in response to massive feminist demonstrations, which combined a conservative vision (in which women were mostly reduced to the role of mothers) and economic neoliberalism.\n\nIn January 2018, Piñera unveiled his cabinet to harsh criticism: his interior minister, Andrés Chadwick, was a vocal supporter of Pinochet dictatorship, which had previously appointed him president of the Catholic University Students Federation. In 2012 Chadwick expressed \"deep repentance\" for this support after discovering \"over the years\" serious human rights violations committed by the dictatorship, while defending the regime on other grounds.\n\nChadwick and justice minister Hernán Larraín were also \"supporters and defenders of the secretive German enclave Colonia Dignidad, which was established by the fugitive Nazi officer and paedophile Paul Schäfer in the early 60s\". Colonia Dignidad was used by Pinochet security officials to torture and murder opponents of the regime.\n\nOther appointees with ties to the Pinochet includes mining minister Baldo Prokurica, a governor under the Pinochet dictatorship.\n\nIn response to the widespread protests that broke out across Chile in October 2019, Piñera declared a state of emergency on 18 October, authorizing the deployment of Chilean Army forces across the main regions to enforce order and prevent the destruction of public property, and invoked before the courts the \"Ley de Seguridad del Estado\" (\"State Security Law\") against dozens of detainees. As a result, Piñera has been heavily criticized, decreasing his approval to only 9% according to a poll by Active Research. On 12 December 2019 the National Congress rejected a motion to impeach him for failure to protect human rights in relation to the protests.\n\nPiñera has often publicly been associated with bad luck. The BBC has listed a series of situations of \"bad luck\" concerning Piñera's presidency: the 2010 Maule earthquake followed by another quake during Piñera's inauguration ceremony, the mining accident of 2010, the 2010 Santiago prison fire, the 2011 Puyehue-Cordón Caulle eruption and the 2012 wildfires.\n\nJosé Mujica, president of Uruguay, stated Piñera's low approval rates might be caused by a lack of \"glamour\".\n\nIn April 2012 \"The Economist\" described Piñera as being considered an \"inept politician\" by both the opposition and supporters. The Chilean government responded by stating that \"The Economist's\" comment was disrespectful. His lapses, errors and inconveniences have been labelled \"piñericosas\" in Chile.\n\nIn June 2013, after visiting President Obama in the White House, he said, \"I'm going to sit at the President of the United States' desk,\" breaking the White House's political protocols. Alfredo Moreno Charme, Minister of Foreign Affairs, said \"How many other presidents have done the same?\" and Obama responded, \"This is the only one,\" causing laughter between those there. Piñera then justified his abrupt actions by stating his daughter was born in the United States.\n\nDuring the 2019–20 Chilean protests Piñera made himself known for the use of a bellicose language. When Piñera addressed the nation on the evening of 20 October during the height of the unrest he remarked that the country was \"at war with a powerful and relentless enemy\" and announced that the state of emergency would be extended across much of the country. Some opposition politicians described his rhetoric as \"irresponsible\", while a Latin America editor for BBC News Online expressed concern about the impact his words would have on the protesters and on the chances for meaningful dialogue. Hours shortly after the President's speech, chief of national defense Javier Iturriaga del Campo spoke against this declaration, asserting that he was \"content\" and \"not at war with anyone\".\n\nHowever the use of bellicose rhetoric can be traced back to at least 2018 when Piñera begun his second government. He has referred to a variety of subjects like drug trafficking, terrorism and organised crime as a \"powerful and relentless enemies\". Besides this Piñera has made frequent use of words like \"battle\", \"conquest\", \"defeat\" and \"combat\" in his verbal communication. According to economist Carlos Tromben who studied the political discourse of Piñera, the aim of this rhetoric is to rally the nation behind what is perceived as a common interest, but the success of this has been variable. Tromben also view the bellicose rhetoric as a defensive communicational strategy aimed to gain time for a \"counterattack\".\n\nPiñera married Cecilia Morel in 1973. They were neighbours in the Avenida Américo Vespucio, Santiago. They have four children, born in 1975, 1978, 1982 and 1984. All of them have university degrees. Piñera is also a member of Washington D.C.-based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue.\n\n\nActor Bob Gunton portrays Piñera in the 2015 film \"The 33\", directed by Patricia Riggen.\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 15, 2005. Originally supposed to air April 10, the episode was dropped from the week's schedule due to the death of Pope John Paul II, since this episode revolved around Catholicism. This episode is also the 350th episode in production order (in broadcast order, \"Future-Drama\" is the 350th episode).\n\nSpringfield Elementary School is holding its medieval festival. All the students are given roles: Lisa is queen, Martin is king, and Bart is the cooper. Bart is mad about his role and is treated terribly by everyone, especially Lisa. Against his will, Groundskeeper Willie is chosen to play the village idiot, and seeking revenge for his cruel treatment, Willie unleashes a pie with hundreds of rats inside. Bart is blamed for this prank and is expelled from school. After looking through other schools, Marge decides to enroll Bart in St. Jerome's Catholic School. There, Bart's hip, rebel attitude is frowned upon.\n\nWhile holding out two dictionaries as a punishment, Bart meets Father Sean (voiced by Liam Neeson), who converted to Catholicism after he was beaten by his father and St. Peter told him to repent. He is sympathetic to Bart and gives him a comic book about the saints, and he is drawn into it. At home, Marge becomes concerned over Bart's interest in the Catholic Church, mainly due to the Catholic ban on birth control. Lisa incorrectly calls Latin 'the language of Plutarch' (who actually wrote in Greek). Homer goes to the school to confront Father Sean, but reconsiders after having a pancake dinner and playing Bingo. After an expansive confession session, and discovering that becoming a Catholic involves more than just bashing Unitarians, Homer decides to convert to Catholicism as well to be absolved of his sins. With Bart and Homer both considering joining the Church, Marge (worried she might be alone in Protestant Heaven while Bart and Homer are in Catholic Heaven and Lisa possibly in nirvana) seeks help from Rev. Lovejoy and Ned Flanders, who agree to get them back. While they are learning about First Communion, Marge, Lovejoy and Ned capture Bart.\n\nOn the road, Marge, Ned and Lovejoy try to bring Bart back to the \"one true faith\": The Western Branch of American Reform Presbylutheranism. Back at the house, Lisa agrees with Homer and Bart's desire to join a new faith. Even after getting laughed at for being Buddhist by Fr. Sean, she says that Marge is taking Bart to a Protestant Youth Festival. Homer and Fr. Sean then leave in hot pursuit. At the Festival, Marge fails to bribe Bart with the Christian rock of Quiet Riot (Pious Riot after their conversion). However, he agrees after he plays some paintball. Homer and Fr. Sean arrive with a motorcycle, shoot Marge's hair with some paintball bullets and engage in a Mexican standoff with Ned and Lovejoy. Bart says it is stupid that all the different forms of Christianity are feuding, explaining that the few stupid things they disagree on are nothing compared to the many stupid things they agree on. The two groups agree to both fight monogamist gays and stem cells and to take Bart's idea to heart. The episode then jumps 1,000 years into the future, when Bart is believed to be the last Prophet of God. In this age, mankind is waging war over whether Bart's teachings were about love and tolerance, or understanding and peace (and whether he was betrayed by his minion Milhouse and ripped apart by snowmobiles until he died). Unable to come to an agreement, one side cries Bart's catchphrase \"Eat my shorts\", the other cries \"Cowabunga\" and both sides engage in a bloody battle.\n\n\nRobert Canning, Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brain Zormski of IGN called this episode the best episode of the sixteenth season. They thought of it as a great episode that dealt with the sensitive topic of religious tolerance, stating that \"with a daring story, we can't help but remember when \"The Simpsons\" was an edgy hip show that would frequently shed a light on cultural complexes\". They thought it would be ideal if there were more episodes like this one.\n\n\"L'Osservatore Romano\", the daily broadsheet of the Vatican, praised the episode for taking up issues such as Christian faith and religion.\n\nMatt Warburton was nominated for a at the 58th Writers Guild of America Awards for his script to this episode.\n\n"}

The Belanglo State Forest is located south of Berrima in the Southern Highlands, three kilometres west of the Hume Highway between Sydney and Canberra. The forest is owned by the New South Wales Government and contains some of the earliest pine plantings in the state. The first radiata pines were planted in this area in 1919. The public has free access to the forest; it features two to four wheel drive tracks, creek crossings, and forest camping. It is popular among recreational trail bike riders.\n\nIn 1992 and 1993, seven skeletons were found in the forest, in what was described by media as the backpacker murders and was considered to be the work of a serial killer. Eventually, Ivan Milat, an Australian of Croatian descent was convicted of the murders in 1996 and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nOn 22 November 2010, three teenagers (including one related to Milat) were arrested on suspicion of connection with the discovery of a murdered male in the forest, following a tip-off. David Auchterlonie was celebrating his 17th birthday on 20 November; Mathew Milat, 17, and Cohen Klein, 18 had planned for over a week to lure Auchterlonie to his death. A third person, Chase Day, 18 whose charges were later withdrawn by the DPP went to police midday 21 November to report the murder.\n\nOn 29 August 2010, trail bike riders discovered a human skeleton in the forest.

The design goal of fish is to give the user a rich set of powerful features in a way that is easy to discover, remember, and use. fish is considered an \"exotic shell\", in that its syntax derives from neither the Bourne shell (ksh, Bash, zsh) nor the C shell (csh, tcsh). Also unlike previous shells, which disable certain features by default to save system resources, fish enables all features by default.\n\nfish has \"search as you type\" automatic suggestions based on history and current directory.\nThis is essentially like Bash's history search, but because it is always on instead of being a separate mode, the user gets continuous feedback while writing the command line, and can select suggestions with the arrow keys, or as in Bash, press for a tab completion instead. Tab-completion is feature-rich, expanding file paths (with wildcards and brace expansion), variables, and many command specific completions. Command-specific completions, including options with descriptions, can to some extent be generated from the commands' manpages.\n\nFish has few syntactic rules, preferring features as commands rather than syntax. This makes features discoverable in terms of commands with options and help texts. Functions can also carry a human readable description. A special \"help\" command gives access to all the fish documentation in the user's web browser.\n\nThe syntax resembles a POSIX compatible shell (such as Bash), but deviates in important ways where the creators believe the POSIX shell was badly designed.\n> set foo bar\n> echo $foo\nbar\n> set wd (pwd)\n> echo $wd\n\n> set A 3 5 7 9 12\n> set B $A[1 2]\n> echo $B\n3 5\n> echo $A[(seq 3)]\n3 5 7\n> set --erase A[$B]\n> echo $A\n3 5 9\n\n> for i in *.jpg\n> for i in *.jpg; convert $i (basename $i .jpg).png; end\n\n> while read line\nSome language constructs, like pipelines, functions and loops, have been implemented using so called subshells in other shell languages. Subshells are simply child programs that run a few commands for the shell and then exit. Unfortunately, this implementation detail typically has the side effect that any state changes made in the subshell, such as variable assignments, do not propagate to the main shell, which may surprise the user. Fish never forks off so-called subshells; all builtins are always fully functional.\n\n> cat *.txt | read line\nThis Bash example does not do what it looks like: because the loop body is a subshell, the update to codice_1 is not persistent.\n\nfound=\"\ncat /etc/fstab | while read dev mnt rest; do\ndone\nWorkaround:\n\nfound=\"\nwhile read dev mnt rest; do\ndone < /etc/fstab\nFish does not need a workaround:\n\nset found \"\ncat /etc/fstab | while read dev mnt rest\nend\nError messages in fish are designed to actually tell the user what went wrong and what can be done about it.\n\n> foo=bar\nfish: Unknown command “foo=bar”. Did you mean “set VARIABLE VALUE”?\nFor information on setting variable values, see the help section on\nthe set command by typing “help set”.\n\n> echo ${foo}bar\nfish: Did you mean {$VARIABLE}?

The Fiji Times Limited board is chaired by Kirit Patel (as of 2010), and includes Rajesh Patel, a resident director appointed in 2010 and Jinesh Patel, the marketing manager for the Motibhai Group of Companies. \n\nThe former publisher Evan Hannah was forcibly removed from Fiji in 2008 as he was accused by the interim government of meddling in Fijian politics. This was prior to the sale by News Corp to the Motibhai Group of Companies.\n\nAn online edition is published, featuring local news, sport and weather.\n\nThe Rabuka administration censored the \"Fiji Times\" for a while following the first military coup of 14 May 1987. In protest, the newspaper published an edition with large blank spaces, where articles censored by the military would have been placed.\n\nThe \"Fiji Times\" announced on 5 December 2006, in the wake of the overthrow of the civilian government by the military, that it was suspending publication rather than bow to government censorship. Military officers had visited the premises that evening to prohibit the publication of any \"propaganda\" in support of the deposed government of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. The online edition would be continuing publication as normal, however. Just before midday on 6 December, the military granted permission for the \"Times\" to resume publication without censorship.\n\nThe \"Times\" reported on 9 December that two members of the public had been detained and questioned by the Military over letters they had written to the \"Times\" editor during the week, and were given a \"verbal warning.\"\n\nNonetheless, from December 2006 to April 2009, the \"Times\" was able to publish continuously articles critical of the interim government. The latter voiced its displeasure, but did not impose censorship. Following the 2009 Fijian constitutional crisis, however, all Fiji's media were censored, including the \"Fiji Times\". Censors are present in the paper's newsrooms. The newspaper's chief editor Netani Rika told Radio New Zealand International that \"his journalists continue to cover every story in detail as if they were working in a democratic country without restrictions. And he says they challenge the censors by putting every possible news item before them.\" The website of the \"Fiji Times\" has also been censored since April 2009.\n\nThe Fiji Labour Party was once highly critical of the \"Fiji Times\", accusing it of political bias.

It is now also a 98 acre (39.8 hectare) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. It runs in an almost straight line from Woodditton south of Newmarket to Reach north-west of Newmarket. It is also a Special Area of Conservation and a Scheduled Monument.\nDevil's Dyke is over long and is the largest of a series of ancient Cambridgeshire dykes. In some places the bank measures high and across. Its highest point is at Gallows Hill where it measures from the bottom of the ditch to the top of the earth wall.\n\nSince the 19th century a railway line and roads have been cut through the dyke, including the combined A14 and A11 roads, and a branch line of the Ipswich to Ely rail line. \n\nFrom Reach, the dyke crosses farmland, before running along the edge of the July Course at Newmarket Racecourse and then through the woods of a private estate near the village of Woodditton. The Rowley Mile course is unusual in that it can have races which start in one county, Cambridgeshire, and finish in another, Suffolk. It crosses the Devil's Dyke where it has been previously levelled.\n\nDevil's Dyke is the largest of several earthworks in south Cambridgeshire that were either boundary markers or designed to control movement along the trackways of Ashwell Street and the Icknield Way. When it was created, it completely blocked a narrow land corridor between the southern edge of a region of water-logged marsh (now known as The Fens) in the north-west and dense woodlands in the south, so making circumvention difficult and forming an effective defensive barrier for the lands to the east. The dyke may have served as a way of controlling trade and movement in and out of the area. Findings such as the small quantity of silt in the ditch fills suggest that the dyke fell into disuse soon after it was built. \n\nThe other Cambridgeshire dykes include Fleam Dyke, Brent Ditch and Bran Ditch. Black Ditches, Cavenham is a fifth earthwork guarding the Icknield Way which is in Suffolk, to the north west of Bury St Edmunds.\n\nThe name Devil's Ditch or Dyke is a post-medieval one. In medieval times it was simply called the \"dic\" meaing the ditch or \"le Micheldyche\" or \"magnum fossatum\" which both mean great ditch\".\"\n\nThe earthwork has been described by various different commentators since Anglo-Saxon times. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" may refer to the Devil's Dyke in its annal for 905, when Edward the Elder is recorded as fighting and defeating the Danes of East Anglia, after first laying waste to the countryside: 'and he laid waste their land between the Dyke and the Ouse as far northward as the Fens'—' \"and oferhergade call hera land betwuh dicun and Wusan. call oþ da fennas norð\"' . Abbo of Fleury, writing in the late 10th century, described East Anglia as \"fortified in the front with a bank or rampier like unto a huge wall, and with a trench or ditch below in the ground\". The mediaeval \"Flores Historiarum\", referred to \" \"...duo fossata sancti Eadmundi...\" \" – the two fortifications of St Edmund – when describing the battle between Edward and his adversaries.\n\nThere have been a number of excavations and investigations of the dyke in modern times, including excavations in 1923 and 1991. In 1991, little was found when a small part of the dyke (measuring ) was excavated prior to the construction of a new aqueduct. The results of a 1988 resistivity survey of the point where Street Way cuts through the dyke were inconclusive. The Dyke is thought most likely to be Anglo-Saxon as there would have been no strategic reason to build it in the Roman period, and the most likely context is the period of warfare between Mercia and East Anglia in the sixth and seventh centuries, when the East Anglians might have thrown it up as a line of defence.\n\nThe site has extensive chalk grassland with diverse species, and areas of woodland and chalk scrub. There are unusual plants such as purple milk-vetch, bastard toadflax and pasque flowers.\n\n\n"}

She was a Country Liberal Party member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from September 2001 to September 2010, representing the Alice Springs-based electorate of Araluen. She was the Shadow Attorney-General, and Shadow Minister for Justice, Health, Family and Community Services, Business and Industry, Women's Policy, Territory Development, the AustralAsia Railway, Police, Fire and Emergency Services, Central Australia and Defence Support. Until 29 January 2008 she was also the Opposition Leader.\n\nCarney announced her resignation from parliament on 19 August 2010, effective 3 September. She cited health reasons as the primary cause of her resignation.\n\nCarney was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and studied at Bendigo High School before commencing a law degree at the University of Melbourne. She graduated in 1989, and moved to Alice Springs the following year in order to do her articles. In 1990, she was admitted to legal practice, and worked as a solicitor for the next seven years. In 1997, she opened her own local practice, which she operated until deciding to contest pre-selection for the Legislative Assembly seat of Araluen at the 2001 election. Jodeen Carney is openly gay, and has been in a same-sex relationship for over twenty years.\n\nCarney's bid for the pre-selection gained some media attention, as she was a reasonably high-profile candidate, but she was ultimately overlooked by the Alice Springs branch. However, John Elferink, a sitting MP who had lost his preselection, complained to the party's Central Council, making claims of branch-stacking. The fallout from the letter was immense—on 25 November 2000, in what was dubbed by the local media as \"The Night of the Long Knives\", all the preselections of the Alice Springs branch were overturned, and the Central Council instead dictated who would run as a CLP candidate. Elferink was reinstated, Carney gained preselection for Araluen, and sitting MP and Minister Loraine Braham was axed to make way for Peter Harvey, who had previously been chosen over Carney in Araluen. While the controversial and largely unprecedented decision from head office would almost ensure her a seat in parliament, it earned her many enemies in the local branch of the party.\n\nWhile Araluen had been a reasonably safe seat for the Country Liberal Party, Carney faced a significant challenge from the Labor Party candidate and two well-known independents. The CLP's vote dropped 27 percentage points from the 1997 election—contested by her long-running predecessor, Eric Poole—although she eventually achieved victory by 134 votes.\n\nAs a new opposition MLA, Carney immediately took on responsibility for several portfolios, including tourism, correctional services and communications. While she often acted as a conservative voice in the assembly on many issues, advocating a particularly hard line on issues of law and order (including mandatory sentencing) and drug policy, this was not always the case, as she also clashed with her own party on several issues—most notably in 2003, when she crossed the floor to vote with the ALP in supporting legislation decreasing the age of consent for gay males.\n\nIn mid-2003, Deputy Opposition Leader Mike Reed resigned, and Carney was widely tipped as the favourite to succeed him. However, in a surprise result—widely put down to both her poor relationship with the influential Alice Springs branch and her support, against their wishes, for Denis Burke's leadership, she was defeated by Dr. Richard Lim. However, she soon changed sides and decided to support Terry Mills after Burke refused to allow a conscience vote on the age of consent legislation. She was subsequently promoted, being made Shadow Attorney-General and Shadow Minister for Justice, and then again in late 2004, being made Shadow Minister for Health.\n\nCarney faced her first re-election bid at the 2005 election. While commentators were generally divided on whether she would hold her seat, as it was the CLP's most marginal, almost no one expected the final result. On election day, there were massive and unprecedented swings to the Labor Party in every seat in the Territory—except Araluen. While Burke, who had not long before regained the leadership, lost his seat of Brennan, which was the safest CLP seat in the Territory, Carney easily held her seat with a swing in her favour in the vicinity of 5%. Araluen was the only seat that saw a swing to the CLP.\n\nBurke had already announced that he would stand down as leader if he lost the election. The loss of his own seat made this promise moot, and speculation turned to who would replace him. Mills unlikely to take up the leadership again after having resigned as leader not long before on the grounds that he had been ineffective, and potential aspirants John Elferink and Sue Carter had also been swept out in the Labor landslide. Carney emerged as the leading candidate to lead what remained of the CLP, and was elected as Burke's replacement with Mills as her deputy.\n\nThough she had not been Opposition Leader for long, Carney oversaw a change in Country Liberal Party policy, shifting it notably to the left—such as attacking the government's law and order policies from a humanitarian, rather than hardline perspective—a position more traditionally aligned with the current government. She adopted a somewhat more congenial attitude towards Chief Minister Clare Martin than her predecessor and tended to be more subtle in her means of attacking Martin.\n\nOn 29 January 2008, Mills asked Carney if she was willing to swap posts with him, with Mills becoming leader and Carney becoming deputy leader. Carney refused, instead calling a leadership spill. The vote was tied at two votes apiece. Under CLP rules, Carney could have theoretically remained leader. However, Carney announced that a tie was not a vote of confidence and resigned, echoing Prime Minister John Gorton's move in 1971. This left Mills to take the leadership unopposed on a second vote.\n\nCarney announced her resignation from parliament on 19 August 2010, effective 3 September. She cited health reasons as the primary cause of her resignation. The CLP's refusal to disendorse Leo Abbott, who had been charged with domestic violence, as their candidate for the Federal seat of Lingiari was also a reason for her resigning, Robyn Lambley, a former deputy mayor of Alice Springs, was elected in her place in a by-election.\n\nTerry Mills went on to become Chief Minister by winning the 2012 election.\nCarney is the earliest CLP leader who did not head a Northern Territory government.\n\nCarney resigned from the CLP in June 2015, citing dissatisfaction with Chief Minister Adam Giles.\n"}

Early that day, , which was engaged on an excursion of the Australian coast, sailed into the area and anchored in Shoal Bay near Hope Inlet. John Lort Stokes, William Forsyth and several other crew members left \"Beagle\" on a longboat for an excursion and passed around Lee Point, in the vicinity of which, there appeared to be a major opening. Stokes was later to record.\n\n\"The sea breeze setting in early, we did not reach it till after dark, when we landed for observations at a cliffy projection near the eastern entrance point: this we found to be composed of a kind of clay, mixed with calcareous matter. We had some difficulty in landing, and then in scrambling up the cliffs by the light of a lantern. If any of the watchful natives happened at the time to be on the look out, they must have stood in astonishment at beholding such strange persons, who at such a time of night, with no ostensible object were visiting their shores\".\n\nThe term 'Night Cliff' was thus applied to the locality, and it subsequently appeared in this form on Surveyor-General George W. Goyder's original plan of 1869. Goyder also mentioned the locality a couple of times in the diary he kept as leader of the Northern Territory Survey Expedition. Despite these well established facts, many people have insisted that the name was derived from a misspelling of the name of John George Knight, one of the best known government officials in Darwin for nearly two decades prior to his death in 1892. It was known that Knight enjoyed visiting the Nightcliff environs and it is believed that he spent long periods of contemplation on the cliff tops. As late as 1952, a former resident who had lived in Darwin between 1876 and 1926 wrote to the Northern Territory News insisting that the area was known during that period as \"\"Knightscliff\"\". It is evident that many Territorians have preferred this variant form of name in deference to one of the most highly distinguished local public figures of the late nineteenth century. However, records show that Knight did not arrive in Darwin until 1873, several years after the publication of Goyder's map.\n\nThe Nightcliff foreshore was the site of Royal Australian Air Force camps with spotlights and large guns used to defend Darwin from bombing during the Second World War. During 1941, a naval outpost including a large concrete artillery outpost bunker was established on the headland. Various other defence facilities were constructed inland as large numbers of military personnel moved into the area. The 2/14 Field Regiment A.I.F. (Australian Infantry Force) was given the task of planning and constructing a hutted camp which became known as \"\"Night Cliff's Camp\"\". After the war, increasing pressure for suburban development caused the Nomenclature Committee of the N.T. to officially name the area on 29 October 1948. The conjoint version of the name, \"\"Nightcliff\"\" was adopted.\n\nToday, a long footpath along the foreshore of Nightcliff is used for walking and cycling, particularly in the evenings after work. Along the footpath there is Nightcliff Jetty, Nightcliff Beach and Nightcliff Swimming Pool.\n\nOn Sundays, the Nightcliff Markets occur from 6am to 2pm. The stalls at the markets are mainly food and drinks but there is also craft and massage stalls. A live music band usually plays music on the stage in the middle of the markets.\n\nThe Nightcliff area is generally associated with its sister suburb, Rapid Creek, and the adjacent northern suburbs of Millner and Coconut Grove. Nightcliff has arguably become one of Darwin's most popular suburbs, as it is mostly situated directly on the coastal fringe. A lot of development has been completed on the coastal road, Casuarina Drive.\n\nSeveral well-known and long-established sports clubs are associated with the Nightcliff regional area, including the Nightcliff Football Club and the Nightcliff Baseball Club.\n\nClose to the foreshore is Nightcliff Primary School, one of Darwin's oldest schools. Nightcliff Middle School provides education for student in years 7 to Year 9.\n\nThe eponymous cliffs of Nightcliff are being actively eroded and around or more of cliff loss has been recorded in the 2014–2016 period. Areas of Nightcliff have been shored up using concrete boulders to form a sea wall.\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 6, 2000. In the episode, the Simpson family rescues a diving horse named Duncan from the abuse of his owner and keeps him as a pet. When the cost of keeping Duncan rises, Homer and Bart train him to be a racehorse. Duncan wins several races and, as a result, Homer is threatened with death by a group of jockeys. Meanwhile, Lisa is upset over her school unfairly losing the musical band competition at a state fair and writes a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton in protest.\n\nThe episode features several guest appearances; horse race caller Trevor Denman stars as himself, commentating the races in the episode, and voice artist Jim Cummings provides the animal sounds made by Duncan. Randy Bachman and Fred Turner appear as themselves as their rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive performs at the state fair. \"Saddlesore Galactica\" was written by Tim Long and directed by Lance Kramer. A number of meta-references are included in the episode, such as the character Comic Book Guy telling the Simpsons that they have owned a horse before in the episode \"Lisa's Pony\".\n\nAround 9.6 million American homes tuned in to watch the episode during its original airing. In 2008, it was released on DVD, along with the rest of the episodes of the eleventh season. \n\n\"Saddlesore Galactica\" is despised by many television critics and fans according to Long. It has been described by About.com's Nancy Basile as one of the season's worst episodes, by Marco Ursi of \"Maclean's\" as the worst episode of the series, and has frequently been cited by fans as an example of the show jumping the shark. Criticism has been directed at its outlandish plot, which, among other things, features elf-like jockeys who lure Homer into their secret lair where they threaten him to stop Duncan from winning.\n\nLisa and the other members of Springfield Elementary's school band enter a music competition together at a state fair, performing James Brown's \"Living in America\". However, they lose to the Ogdenville Elementary band, which performs John Philip Sousa's \"Stars and Stripes Forever\" and uses red, white, and blue glowsticks to form a flag. Lisa accuses Ogdenville of cheating as the use of visual aids is against the rules of the competition. She later writes a letter to President Clinton, complaining about the situation. At the fair, Homer and Bart see a horse named Duncan that can dive into pools. The Simpsons take Duncan home after his sleazy owner is accused of animal cruelty and flees. However, they find themselves spending $500 a week for Duncan's upkeep.\n\nHomer and Bart try to think of a way that Duncan can make money to help offset the costs of keeping him. Bart discovers that Duncan is a fast runner and suggests that he should be a racehorse. Homer enters Duncan at the Springfield Downs race track, with Bart as the jockey. However, a frightened Duncan loses his first race as he refuses to leave the stall until all other horses have finished. Homer and Bart find a strategy for Duncan to win by turning him into a frightening horse named \"Furious D\", complete with dyed hair and one of Lisa's bracelets for a nose ring. He intimidates the other horses and wins several races. Homer is soon invited by the losing jockeys to have a beer in their lounge, which turns out to be a secret lair. The jockeys reveal themselves to be crazy, arrogant elf-based creatures and threaten to eat Homer's brain unless he makes Duncan lose the upcoming Springfield Derby. Though frightened at first, Homer changes his mind due to his loyalty to his son and his horse as well as his own pride, vowing to deal with those \"murderous trolls\".\n\nDuncan wins the Derby, sending the jockeys into a rage, and they begin chasing after Homer and Bart with swords. However, Marge and Lisa spray the jockeys with water to subdue them, and Homer stuffs them all into a garbage bag and leaves them at the curb to be hauled away with the garbage. Homer and Bart prepare to retire Duncan from racing so he can become a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house and presents Lisa with a plaque, overruling the state fair judges and declaring Springfield Elementary as the winner of the music competition.\n\n\"Saddlesore Galactica\" was written by Tim Long and directed by Lance Kramer as part of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\" (1999–2000). The title is a reference to the science fiction television series \"Battlestar Galactica\". The idea of Duncan originally being a diving horse was inspired by an actual diving horse that used to jump into a pool at Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey at the beginning of the 20th century; a postcard showing this horse was used as a reference by the animators for the scenes featuring the diving. When the animation process began, Kramer drew instructions to his animators on how horses move when they run and how their ankles work. He has said that because Duncan was a large part of the story, \"we wanted him to have somewhat of a personality. So when everybody knew how to draw the horse and we got that out of the way, they could animate the horse acting.\" Voice artist Jim Cummings provided the animal sounds made by Duncan in the episode.\n\nAmerican horse race caller Trevor Denman guest starred in the episode as himself, commentating on Duncan's races over the public-address system. Randy Bachman and Fred Turner, known for their rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive, made an appearance in the episode as themselves. They perform on stage at the state fair during the beginning of the episode. When Bachman and Turner tell the audience that they are going to play some songs from their new album, Homer immediately yells out demands for them to play their old song \"Takin' Care of Business\". The band starts the song and Homer then yells, \"Get to the 'workin overtime' part!\" The band obliges, skipping straight to the chorus. Bachman had left the band when \"Saddlesore Galactica\" was recorded and because of tension between him and Turner, the two recorded their lines separately on different occasions. Long has said that the \"Simpsons\" staff members \"were thrilled to have [them] on the show\" and that the pair \"could not have been nicer.\"\n\nThe episode is heavily self-referential and contains a number of meta-references. When the Simpsons take Duncan home from the fair, Comic Book Guy points out to the Simpsons that they have already taken in a horse as a pet (as seen in \"Lisa's Pony\"), and that \"the expense forced Homer to work at the Kwik-E-Mart, with hilarious consequences.\" In another scene later in the episode, when Lisa points out to Marge that Marge is showing signs of gambling problems, Comic Book Guy shows up again wearing a T-shirt that says \"Worst Episode Ever\" and tells Lisa: \"Hey, I'm watching you!\" This refers to the fact that Marge's gambling problems have already been explored in the episode \"$pringfield\".\n\nJonathan Gray analyzed the self-referentiality in \"The Simpsons\" in his 2006 book \"Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality\", writing that \"Sitcoms constantly 'reset' themselves, living in [...] an 'existential circle' in which nothing really changes, and every episode starts more or less where the last one started; and \"The Simpsons\" frequently plays with this sitcom clock, and with the amnesia of sitcom memory. The family members often forget important events in their 'history' [...]\". Gray noted that in \"Saddlesore Galactica\", \"the action continues as normal, as sitcom memory (or lack thereof) is pointed out but comically not acted upon. Thus, where David Grote [author of \"The End of Comedy: The Sit-Com and the Comedic Tradition\"] (1983: 67) notes that sitcom episodes 'live in a kind of time-warp without any reference to the other episodes,' producing a situation whereby everything 'remains inviolate and undisturbed, no matter what transitory events may occur' (1983: 59), \"The Simpsons\" comically reflects upon this.\"\n\nThe episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 6, 2000. It was viewed in approximately 9.6 million households that night. With a Nielsen rating of 9.5, \"Saddlesore Galactica\" finished 29th in the ratings for the week of January 31–February 6, 2000. It was the second highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week, following an episode of \"Malcolm in the Middle\". On October 7, 2008, \"Saddlesore Galactica\" was released on DVD as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season\". Staff members Tim Long, Lance Kramer, Mike Scully, Matt Groening, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, and Tom Martin participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set.\n\nAccording to Long, \"Saddlesore Galactica\" is considered by many critics and fans as one of the worst episodes in the history of the show, particularly for the scenes featuring the jockey elves. \n\nIn 2007, \"Maclean's\" writer Marco Ursi named it his least favorite episode of \"The Simpsons\", elaborating: \"This is the one where the Simpsons get a horse – again – and the plot devolves into something involving the secret land of the jockeys. Making meta-references to the fact you’ve just made your 'worst episode ever' doesn’t make it any funnier.\" \n\nNancy Basile of About.com listed the episode as one of the worst episodes of the season—one of the episodes that made her \"cringe because they included blatant gimmicks and outlandish plots\".\n\nDespite its criticisms, \"Saddlesore Galactica\" received some positive reviews. While reviewing the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\", DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode, writing: \"I remember that 'Saddlesore' was much despised when it first aired, though I can’t recall if I joined that chorus as well. Maybe the many iffy episodes since early 2000 have made it look better, but I think that 'Saddlesore' offers a decent number of laughs. It goes off onto some dopey tangents and displays an unnerving tendency toward self-awareness, but it provides reasonable entertainment.\" \n\nDVD Talk's Ian Jane described the cameo appearance by Bachman and Turner as \"fun\".\n\n"}

In total he wrote sixteen monologues for Stanley Holloway, whilst Holloway himself wrote only five.\n\nEdgar's Great grandfather was James Henry Marriott. His parents were Jane (also known as Jenny) \"née\" Taylor, born in London in 1856, and Richard Horatio Marriott Edgar (1847–1894), only son of Alice Marriott (1824–1900), proprietress of the Marriott family theatre troupe. Richard was born in Manchester, Lancashire, near Christmas 1847 as Richard Horatio Marriott; both his two sisters, Adeline Marriott (b. 1853) and Grace Marriott (b. 1858) were also born in Lancashire. Later all three children chose to take the surname of their mother's husband, Robert Edgar, whom she married in 1856.\n\nRichard and Jane married in March 1875, with Richard being unaware that he had fathered an illegitimate namesake son, Richard Horatio Edgar Wallace, with widowed actress Mrs Mary Jane \"Polly\" Richards, after a brief sexual encounter. Polly, having invented an obligation in London to hide her pregnancy, gave birth in secret on 1 April 1875, almost a month after Richard and Jenny married. This son became the famous journalist, novelist, playwright and screenplay writer Edgar Wallace.\n\nRichard and Jenny Taylor's children were Alice Marriott Edgar (b. 1876, London), twins Richard and Jennifer Marriott Edgar (b. 1878, London), after whose births the family moved to Scotland, where George was born, then returning to London, where Joseph Marriott Edgar was born in 1884 and Adeline Alice Edgar in 1886.\n\nGeorge Marriott Edgar was a performer, poet and writer. He began his career as a scene-painter, but from 1907 until his death, he was known to the public as a comedian who played pantomime dames. During the First World War he served with the Royal Sussex Regiment and the Mechanical Transport, and afterwards he toured Australia, New Zealand and South Africa with his Dame act. In 1929, he joined the cast of \"The Co-Optimists\" and worked with Stanley Holloway. At the start of the 1930s they went to Hollywood, where Edgar – who had dropped his first name for the professional appellation Marriott Edgar – met his half-brother Edgar Wallace.\n\nHolloway was already enjoying some success with the monologue format, with such classics as \"Sam, Pick Oop Tha' Musket\". Edgar asked him if he had heard a story about a couple who had taken their son to the zoo, only to see the lad eaten by a lion. Holloway had indeed heard the story, and shortly afterwards Edgar supplied him with a script. \"The Lion and Albert\" became one of Holloway's most popular pieces, one of many he recorded beginning in 1930. The lion of the poem is named \"Wallace\", which was the name of the first African lion to be bred in Britain, living from 1812 until 1838, and his name became a popular one for lions. Edgar gave the poem the title \"The Lion and Albert\", but some later performances and re-publications used the form \"Albert and the Lion\". A pub on Blackpool Promenade also uses the latter form.\n\nThe monologues were designed to be spoken rhythmically with piano accompaniment, which in many cases was also composed by Edgar. The texts were published by Francis, Day & Hunter during the 1930s in three collections. All were illustrated by John Hassall, many of whose lively images also became classics. Edgar's compositions were\n\n\"The Lion and Albert\" and \"The Return of Albert\" have been translated into German under the titles \"Der Löwe und Albert\" and \"Albert kommt wieder, na klar!\" respectively. \"The Lion and Albert\" has been performed as a two-part song of eighteen verses to an Irish folk tune by Kathy Hampson's Free Elastic Band.\n\nIn 1991, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a series of eight programs entitled \"Marriott's Monologues\", with a different monologist in each program performing Marriott's monologues with piano accompaniment and discussing the monologues. The monologists included Dame Thora Hird, Betty Driver, Les Dawson, Roy Hudd, Kenneth Waller, Peter Goodwright, Bernie Clifton and Roy Castle.\n\nEdgar worked for Gainsborough Pictures between 1936 and 1944, as a scriptwriter for a number of British films (mostly comedies) such as:\nEdgar married Mildred Williams in Brentford in 1904. They had a son, Hindle (1905–1985), who was an actor. Edgar died in Battle, East Sussex, on 5 May 1951.\n\n"}

It was originally a traveling theater ensemble with many members, most notably Ulf Dageby, Anders Melander, Totta Näslund, Nikke Ström, Hans Mosesson and Pale Olofsson.\n\nInitially formed as a free theater group in Lund in 1968, Nationalteatern moved to Gothenburg and started to put heavy emphasis on the musical part of the plays. The leader of the group in the early days was Anders Melander, who also played most of the instruments on the group's debut album, \"Ta det som ett löfte...ta det inte som ett hot\" (Take it as a promise...don’t take it as a threat). On the second album, \"Livet är en fest\" (Life is a party), Ulf Dageby was allowed more creative room, and he later evolved into the group's driving force. The album was a more straightforward rock album than the previous one, a formula that proved very successful.\n\nIn 1977, many members of Nationalteatern played a significant part in The Tent Project. The next year saw the release of \"Barn av vår tid\" (Children of our time) – the first album featuring Totta Näslund – and still later \"Rövarkungens ö\" (The Island of the Bandit King). After 1980, the group moved away from the theatrical work and concentrated on music, calling themselves a \"rock orchestra\". The group dissolved soon afterward, but the new millennium has seen several reunions of Nationalteatern, touring all over Sweden, even after Totta Näslund died in 2005. No new songs or albums have yet been recorded.\n\nIn 2002 a tribute album, \"Nationalsånger - Hymner från Vågen och EPAs torg\", was released, featuring several of Sweden's most famous musicians (such as Backyard Babies, The Hellacopters, The Soundtrack of Our Lives, Lisa Miskovsky, and The Ark) performing Nationalteatern songs.\n\nTheir music, which was composed to the plays the group wrote and performed at youth community centers in Sweden, was written in a youth-in-trouble-theme, often containing an anti-drug message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1889974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889974", "title": "Proto-Greek language", "text": "Proto-Greek language\n\nThe Proto-Greek language (also known as Proto-Hellenic) is an Indo-European language. It is assumed to be the last common ancestor of all known varieties of Greek, including Mycenaean Greek, the subsequent ancient Greek dialects (i.e., Attic, Ionic, Aeolic, Doric, Ancient Macedonian and Arcadocypriot) and, ultimately, Koine, Byzantine and Modern Greek. The unity of Proto-Greek would have ended as Hellenic migrants, who spoke the predecessor of the Mycenaean language, entered the Greek peninsula sometime in the Bronze Age.\n\nProto-Greek was originally a dialect of the Proto-Indo-European language. In the late Neolithic, speakers of this dialect, which would become Proto-Greek, migrated from their homeland northeast of the Black Sea to the Balkans and into the Greek peninsula. The evolution of Proto-Greek could be considered within the context of an early Paleo-Balkan sprachbund that makes it difficult to delineate exact boundaries between individual languages. The characteristically Greek representation of word-initial laryngeals by prothetic vowels is shared, for one, by the Armenian language, which also seems to share some other phonological and morphological peculiarities of Greek; this has led some linguists to propose a hypothetically closer relationship between Greek and Armenian, although evidence remains scant.\n\nProto-Greek is mostly placed in the Early Helladic period (late 4th millennium BC; circa 3200 BC) towards the end of the Neolithic in Southern Europe. Ivo Hajnal dates the beginning of the differentiation of Proto-Greek into the Greek dialects to a point not significantly earlier than 1700 BC, however.\n\nProto-Greek is reconstructed with the following phonemes:\n\n\nThe primary sound changes separating Proto-Greek from the Proto-Indo-European language include:\n\nLoss of prevocalic \"*s\" was not completed entirely, evidenced by \"sȳ́s\" ~ \"hȳ́s\" 'pig' (from PIE *suh₁-), \"dasýs\" 'dense' and \"dásos\" 'dense growth, forest'; *\"som\" 'with' is another example, contaminated with PIE \"*ḱom\" (Latin \"cum\"; preserved in Greek \"kaí\", \"katá\", \"koinós\") to Mycenaean \"ku-su\" /ksun/, Homeric / Old Attic \"ksýn\", later \"sýn\". Furthermore, \"sélas\" 'light in the sky, as in the aurora' and \"selḗnē/selā́nā\" 'moon' may be more examples of the same if it derived from PIE \"*swel-\" 'to burn' (possibly related to \"hḗlios\" 'sun', Ionic \"hēélios\" < \"*sāwélios\").\n\nDissimilation of aspirates (so-called Grassmann's law) caused an initial aspirated sound to lose its aspiration when a following aspirated consonant occurred in the same word. It was a relatively late change in Proto-Greek history and must have occurred independently of the similar dissimilation of aspirates (also known as Grassmann's law) in Indo-Iranian, although it may represent a common areal feature:\n\nGreek is unique in reflecting the three different laryngeals with distinct vowels. Most Indo-European languages can be traced back to a dialectal variety of late Proto-Indo-European (PIE) in which all three laryngeals had merged (after colouring adjacent short vowels), but Greek clearly cannot. For that reason, Greek is extremely important in reconstructing PIE forms.\n\nGreek shows distinct reflexes of the laryngeals in various positions:\n\n\n\nAll of the cases may stem from an early insertion of next to a laryngeal not adjacent to a vowel in the Indo-European dialect ancestral to Greek (subsequently coloured to , , by the particular laryngeal in question) prior to the general merger of laryngeals:\n\nA laryngeal adjacent to a vowel develops along the same lines as other Indo-European languages:\n\nProto-Greek underwent palatalization of consonants before \"*y\". This occurred in two separate stages. The first stage affected only dental consonants, while the second stage affected all consonants.\n\nThe first palatalization turned dentals + \"*y\" into alveolar affricates:\n\nAlongside these changes, the inherited clusters \"*ts\", \"*ds\" and \"*tʰs\" all merged into \"*ts\".\n\nIn the second palatalization, all consonants were affected. It took place following the resolution of syllabic laryngeals and sonorants. The following table, based on American linguist Andrew Sihler, shows the developments.\n\nIn post-Proto-Greek times, the resulting palatal consonants and clusters were resolved in varying ways. Most notably, \"*ň\" and \"*ř\" were resolved into plain sonorants plus a palatal on-glide, which eventually turned the preceding vowel into a diphthong.\n\nIn the time between the first and second palatalizations, new clusters \"*tsy\" and \"*dzy\" were formed by restoring a lost \"*y\" after the newly formed \"*ts\" and \"*dz\". This occurred only in morphologically transparent formations, by analogy with similar formations where \"*y\" was preceded by other consonants. In formations that were morphologically opaque and not understood as such by speakers of the time, this restoration did not take place and \"*ts\" and \"*dz\" remained. Hence, depending on the type of formation, the Pre-Greek sequences \"*ty\", \"*tʰy\" and \"*dy\" have different outcomes in the later languages. In particular, medial \"*ty\" becomes Attic \"s\" in opaque formations, but \"tt\" in transparent formations.\n\nThe outcome of PG medial \"*ts\" in Homeric Greek is \"s\" after a long vowel, and vacillation between \"s\" and \"ss\" after a short vowel: \"tátēsi\" dat. pl. \"rug\" < \"tátēt-\", \"possí(n)/posí(n)\" dat. pl. \"foot\" < \"pod-\". This was useful for the composer of the Iliad and Odyssey, since \"possí\" with double \"ss\" scans as long-short, while \"posí\" with single \"s\" scans as short-short. Thus the writer could use each form in different positions in a line.\n\nExamples of initial \"*ts\":\n\nExamples of medial \"*ts\" (morphologically opaque forms, first palatalization only):\n\nExamples of medial \"*ťť\" (morphologically transparent forms, first and second palatalization):\n\nSound changes between Proto-Greek and all early dialects, including Mycenaean Greek, include:\n\nThe following changes are apparently post-Mycenaean:\n\nNote that and , when following a vowel and not preceding a vowel, combined early on with the vowel to form a diphthong and so were not lost.\n\nLoss of and after a consonant was often accompanied by compensatory lengthening of a preceding vowel.\n\nThe development of labiovelars varies from dialect to dialect:\n\nThe results of vowel contraction were complex from dialect to dialect. Such contractions occur in the inflection of a number of different noun and verb classes and are among the most difficult aspects of Ancient Greek grammar. They were particularly important in the large class of \"contracted verbs\", denominative verbs formed from nouns and adjectives ending in a vowel. (In fact, the reflex of contracted verbs in Modern Greek, the set of verbs derived from Ancient Greek contracted verbs, represents one of the two main classes of verbs in that language.)\n\nAs Mycenaean Greek shows, the PIE dative (suffix \"-i\"), instrumental (suffix \"-phi\") and locative (suffix \"-si\") cases are still distinct and are not yet syncretized into other cases.\n\nNominative plural \"-oi\", \"-ai\" replaces late PIE \"-ōs\", \"-ās\".\n\nThe superlative in \"-tatos\" becomes productive.\n\nThe peculiar oblique stem \"gunaik-\" \"women\", attested from the Thebes tablets is probably Proto-Greek. It appears, at least as \"gunai-\" in Armenian as well.\n\nThe pronouns \"hoûtos\", \"ekeînos\" and \"autós\" are created. The use of \"ho, hā, to\" as articles is post-Mycenaean.\n\nProto-Greek inherited the augment, a prefix \"e-\", to verbal forms expressing past tense. That feature is shared only with Indo-Iranian and Phrygian (and to some extent, Armenian), lending some support to a \"Graeco-Aryan\" or \"Inner PIE\" proto-dialect. However, the augment down to the time of Homer remained optional and was probably little more than a free sentence particle, meaning \"previously\" in the proto-language, which may easily have been lost by most other branches.

By 2500 BC, Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian had separated, moving westward and eastward from the Pontic Steppe, respectively.\n\nIf Graeco-Aryan is a valid group, Grassmann's law may have a common origin in Greek and Sanskrit. However, Grassmann's law in Greek postdates certain sound changes that happened only in Greek and not Sanskrit, which suggests that it could not have been inherited directly from a common Graeco-Aryan stage. Rather, it is more likely that an areal feature spread across a then-contiguous Graeco-Aryan–speaking area. That would have occurred after early stages of Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian had developed into separate dialects but before they ceased to be in geographic contact.\n\nEvidence for the existence of a Graeco-Aryan subclade was given by Wolfram Euler's 1979 examination on shared features in Greek and Sanskrit nominal inflection. Graeco-Aryan is invoked in particular in studies of comparative mythology such as Martin Litchfield West (1999) and Calvert Watkins (2001).\n\nA widely rejected hypothesis has placed Greek in a Graeco-Armenian subclade of Indo-European, though some researchers have integrated both attempts by including also Armenian in a putative \"Graeco-Armeno-Aryan\" language family, further divided between Proto-Greek (possibly united with Phrygian) and thus arriving at an \"Armeno-Aryan\" subclade, the putative ancestor of Armenian and Indo-Iranian.\n\nGraeco-Aryan has comparatively wide support among Indo-Europeanists who support the Armenian hypothesis, which asserts that the homeland of the Indo-European language family was in the Armenian Highlands.\n"}

In the episode, she is killed in an accident while watching an auto race, devastating Ned Flanders and prompting Homer to find a new woman for his grieving friend. After a series of unsuccessful dates, Ned begins to question his faith in God. However, his faith is restored after hearing the female lead singer of a Christian rock band, played by guest star Shawn Colvin, sing in church. The episode's title is a parody of the song title \"Alone Again (Naturally)\" by Gilbert O'Sullivan.\n\nThe episode was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Jim Reardon. Maude was voiced by Marcia Mitzman Gaven after regular voice actor Maggie Roswell had left the show over a pay dispute, and the producers decided to kill off the character to open up for new storylines. The episode was viewed in 10.8 million households during its original broadcast on February 13, 2000, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.\n\nA commercial for \"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\" that aired before the episode was broadcast was criticized by many viewers because it appeared the episode would be parodying an incident at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte, North Carolina that left three spectators dead. Then-Fox affiliate WCCB in Charlotte, North Carolina refused to show the commercial, but after viewing the episode they came to the conclusion that it was not making fun of the incident. \n\nReviews of \"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\" from television critics have been mixed.\n\nOn a trip to the bird sanctuary, the Simpson family discovers that an oval racing track built around the sanctuary is opening that day, to Lisa's dismay. The family watches the stock car race from the stand and sees Ned Flanders and his family, who claims to enjoy the high levels of safety the drivers use. Later, a squad of cheerleaders fires free T-shirts from air cannons into the crowd, and Homer rudely demands one. Irritated, Maude leaves to buy hot dogs. Homer draws a bullseye on his stomach using a bottle of ketchup, and the cheerleaders send a full salvo of T-shirts in Homer's direction, but he bends down at the last second to pick up a bobby pin on the ground. Maude returns at that exact moment, gets hit by the T-shirts and falls over the edge of the bleachers on the parking lot. The impact of the fall kills her.\n\nEveryone offers their condolences to a devastated Ned, and Bart reluctantly plays a Christian video game with Rod and Todd. Homer accompanies Ned back home after the funeral and talks with him later that night when Ned is unable to sleep due to his loneliness and concern over having to raise his sons alone. Feeling bad for his part in Maude's death, Homer secretly makes a videotape of Ned to show to single women across Springfield in order to help him get on with his life. Ned gets to date several women thanks to the tape, including Lindsey Naegle and Edna Krabappel, but none of them are successful.\n\nOn a Saturday night, Ned prays to God, but becomes angry when he feels he is not getting any response. The next morning, Ned is still angry and tells his sons he will not be going to church, scaring them. Guilt-ridden, he later rushes to church and upon entering, sees a Christian rock band, Kovenant, performing. He is attracted to the singer, Rachel Jordan, who sings about not losing faith in God because He is always there for people. Inspired by the song, Ned later assists Rachel in loading some equipment onto her truck and confides in her of his loss, with which she sympathizes. He and Rachel become acquainted, but she has to leave for the next stop on the band's tour, promising to come back and meet up with him afterward.\n\n\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\" was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Jim Reardon as part of the eleventh season of the show (1999–2000). When the writing staff conceived the idea for the speedway parts, they were thinking that it would be a great opportunity for them to get several NASCAR drivers to make guest appearances in the episode. However, according to Scully, they could not get a single one because \"they were all concerned about the way we were portraying NASCAR\". Speedway racing is depicted in a negative light in the episode, with an overemphasis on crashes.\n\nThe episode features the death of the character Maude Flanders, who had previously been voiced by cast member Maggie Roswell. This kill-off was the result of Roswell leaving \"The Simpsons\" in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with the Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs the show. Since 1994, she had been flying between her Denver home and Los Angeles twice a week to record episodes of \"The Simpsons\". She eventually grew tired of this, and the price of plane tickets was constantly increasing. As a result, she asked Fox for a pay raise from $2,000 per episode to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit.\n\nVoice actress Marcia Mitzman Gaven was hired to fill in for Roswell's characters, including Maude in this episode and the earlier episodes of the eleventh season, although the producers decided to kill her off to open up new storylines for the show. Executive producer Mike Scully said it \"was a chance for one of our regular characters [Ned Flanders] to face a challenge and grow in a new direction. The idea came up quickly, we all latched on to it, and it just felt right. We didn't want to kill a character for the sake of killing. We wanted it to have consequences for surviving characters to deal with in future episodes.\" Roswell returned to \"The Simpsons\" in 2002 after reaching a deal with Fox to record her lines from her home in Denver. Since returning, she has voiced Maude in flashbacks and as a ghost. When asked by \"The Denver Post\" on how she thought Ned was doing without Maude, she replied: \"OK. But Maude was such a vulnerable character. Maude and Lisa and Marge were the only vulnerable characters, really, everybody else has an edge. So they [the staff] discovered that arc was lost, and now there are a lot of flashbacks with Maude.\"\n\nScully has noted that \"there was a lot of discussion about making sure we [the staff] did deal with some of the emotional ramifications of death [in the episode] and not just make it all joke, joke, joke. But at the same time, we're a comedy, they're animated, they're not real.\" In one of the first scripts for the episode there was a scene in which Rod and Todd discuss their mother's death. However, according to Maxtone-Graham, the writing staff decided to cut it because \"it just never played anything but sad.\" He added that the writers \"really wanted to address how [the children] would feel\" but they \"could never pull it off without it just being sad.\" Scully has commented that it was a \"very sweet scene\" but it was too difficult to \"get out of it comedically to the next scene.\"\nAmerican musician Shawn Colvin guest starred in the episode as Rachel Jordan, a character that she would later return to voice in the episode \"I'm Goin' to Praiseland\" (2001) from season twelve. In that episode, she stays at the Flanders' house with Ned, and leaves briefly after he attempted to mold her in the image of his deceased wife. At the end of the episode, however, she returns and has a date with him. Colvin told the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" that being raised in Carbondale, Illinois meant she did not have to do much research for the guest appearance: \"It's just very isolated [in Carbondale]. There was church music and that was about it. [...] I didn't have to dig too deep for the role. I suppose the whole 'Simpsons' thing is kind of like a hick town.\" Colvin has shown a segment of her guest role on \"The Simpsons\" during some of her concerts, including one at Cape Cod Melody Tent in 2007. She has also performed the song that she sings in \"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\" in concert. The \"Wisconsin State Journal\" reported that during her 2001 concert at Barrymore Theatre, the \"loudest audience response came after she sang a ditty that she performed as a character on \"The Simpsons\".\" The song, called \"He's the Man\", later appeared on the 2007 soundtrack album \"\".\n\nThe episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 13, 2000. It tied \"Dateline NBC\" for the 17th place (compared the season average of 37) in the ratings for the week of February 7–13, 2000, with a Nielsen rating of 10.7. The episode was the highest-rated show on Fox that week, and was viewed in approximately 10.8 million households.\n\nScully has admitted that another reason for killing off Maude was to increase ratings for \"The Simpsons\" during the February sweeps. To bring in even more viewers for the broadcast, the \"Simpsons\" producers chose not to reveal beforehand who the character that would be killed off was to create speculation. Fox also decided not to send out screener tapes to television critics to keep it a secret. However, according to an article in the \"Contra Costa Times\" that was published on the day the episode aired, \"all the advance rumors suggest that Ned Flanders' wife, Maude, should watch her back.\" The revelation of the episode's title, \"Alone Again, Natura-Diddly\", was one of the reasons that the media and many people suspected Maude. As \"The Post-Standard\"s William LaRue writes, \"diddly\" is the \"familiar greeting of Maude's husband, Ned Flanders.\" Roswell's announced departure strengthened this suspicion.\n\nThe episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. \n\nGregory Hardy of the \"Orlando Sentinel\" placed it at number eleven on his list of the show's fifteen best episodes that target the world of sports. \n\nWriting for IGN, Robert Canning gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating, commenting that he thought the three acts felt disconnected. He wrote: \"First Maude dies, then Ned dates and now Ned questions his faith. To me, these three storylines would have been better served had they been the focus of their own individual episodes.\" Canning added that he felt \"the episode made a poor choice by rushing through the mourning period and moving right into Ned dating,\" but that \"the dating stuff, while, again, feeling hurried, was quite funny, especially Ned's date with Edna Krabappel.\"\n\nDVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode in a negative way, writing that it was \"a harsh and cynical move [to kill off Maude because of Roswell's departure], though I could forgive the decision if it produced a more satisfying episode. Perhaps the writers made this one super-sincere to counteract the inherent cynicism behind its origins, but the show just seems sappy and lame.\" \n\n\"Winnipeg Free Press\" columnist Randall King wrote in his review of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\" that there is \"something undeniably funny about having Maude Flanders die by a barrage of T-shirts fired by air cannons at a speedway. But the episode Alone Again Natura-Diddily was proof that the dependably brilliant series could – and did – go seriously wrong when it turned 11. Killing off Maude was a sin [...]\".\n\nBefore \"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\" was broadcast, a promotional commercial aired on television that featured, among other things, the announcement that \"one of Springfield's most beloved will die\" and a snippet of a scene from the episode with the character Lenny, sitting in the speedway spectator stand, being hit by a car tire, giving the impression that he would be the one who would die. Many viewers of the commercial, including Speedway Motorsports, Inc. owned Lowe's Motor Speedway president and public address announcer Jerry Gappens, expressed their concern as it appeared the episode was parodying an actual incident that happened during a speedway race at Lowe's Motor Speedway in May 1999, in Charlotte, North Carolina, when flying debris in a crash killed three spectators. Gappens said that doing a parody of that was \"a real insensitive thing to do, pretty irresponsible. Obviously what might appear funny in L.A. or New York isn't funny here in Charlotte.\" Lowe's Motor Speedway announced to WSOC-TV's \"Channel 9 Eyewitness News\" on February 7, 2000 that they were thinking of placing a complaint to the Fox Broadcasting Company. WCCB, the then-Fox affiliate in Charlotte, refused to continue showing the commercial for the episode. As a result, Fox distributed a new commercial to the affiliate on February 9 that did not contain the scene with Lenny.\n\nAntonia Coffman, a spokeswoman for \"The Simpsons\", told \"The Charlotte Observer\" that \"the Lowe's incident didn't inspire the scene\" and that the episode was not meant to offend anyone. After WCCB had gotten the opportunity to actually see the episode they decided that they would air it, realizing that the original commercial was misleading and that they did not think the episode was making fun of the incident. In the episode, the viewers can see that Lenny tries to get the attention of the cheerleaders by raising his hand so that they aim a T-shirt with the cannon at him. However, he is hit by a car tire instead. Unlike what the commercial implied, Lenny is not killed and is soon back in his seat. WCCB told the Associated Press that their interpretation of the scene was that someone threw the tire to Lenny because he was raising his hand, and that the tire did not actually come from a car crash on the track. Despite this, the affiliate announced that they would start the broadcast of the episode with a message warning viewers of the scene anyway.\n\n"}

Both were already established as painters at the time of their marriage. Their second-born son Merric Boyd married Doris Gough and had five artistic children, Lucy de Guzman Boyd, Arthur Boyd, Guy Boyd, David Boyd, and Mary Elizabeth Boyd.\n\nIn 1948 David Boyd married Hermia Lloyd-Jones, the daughter of graphic artist Herman and Erica Lloyd-Jones. Following the tradition of their family, their three daughters Amanda, Lucinda, and Cassandra are artists.\n\nBoyd entered the Melba Memorial Conservatorium of Music in Melbourne at seventeen, but was conscripted to the army after one year. Upon his return, he studied art at the National Gallery School on an ex-serviceman's grant.\n\nIn 1946, he worked with his brother Guy at the Martin Boyd Pottery in Sydney. He also established a pottery studio in London in the early 1950s and continued working mainly in pottery through to the mid-1960s. In 1956, Boyd and his wife became widely known as leading Australian potters. They introduced new glazing techniques and potter's wheel use in shaping sculptural figures.\n\nBoyd's painting career began in 1957 with a series of symbolic paintings on Australian explorers that aroused much controversy at the time, focusing as they did on the tragic history of the Aboriginal Tasmanians. In 1958 he exhibited a series of paintings based on the histological episodes in the explorations of Burke and wills and Bass and Flinders. He joined the Antipodeans Group in the 1950s. \nBoyd discovered a technique in 1966 that he named Sfumato, after da Vinci's usage of the word to describe graduations of smoky tones in painting. Boyd's method achieved this effect through a new technique involving candle flame.\n\nBoyd and his family moved to Rome in 1961, and later moved to London. They also spent several years creating art in Spain and the south of France before returning permanently to Australia in 1975.\n\nDavid Boyd was artist-in-residence at the School of Law, Macquarie University, Sydney from 1993–1996.\n\nIn a September 2004 art review, Alex McDonald of \"State of the Arts\" magazine stated that David Boyd's work was 'ahead of his time in addressing the mistreatment of Indigenous people in Australia, but commented that an 'explanation for his frosty reception from Australian critics and dealers may have something to do with his choice of subject matter'. McDonald explained that the controversy may have stemmed from the fact that the 'legal system, race relations and religion' are 'not exactly popular issues' and were not 'up for debate in the late 1950s'.\n\n\n\n"}

Its west end starts in Ontonagon and runs east to Baraga, some apart. The highway crosses streams and rivers in forest lands and provides access to a casino. The east end is located by the Keweenaw Bay of Lake Superior in the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community.\n\nThere have been two highways in the state to carry the designation. The first was located in the southeastern Lower Peninsula. The current version of M-38 was created from a section of M-35 in the 1960s. This section was orphaned from the rest of M-35 when the highway was cancelled through the Huron Mountains.\n\nM-38 begins at a four-way intersection in Ontonagon. US Highway 45 (US 45) runs north–south through this intersection while M-64 runs west and M-38 runs east on Steel Street. This intersection is both the eastern terminus of M-64 and the western terminus of M-38. From here, M-38 forms a segment of the Lake Superior Circle Tour along Ontonagon–Greenland Road to a junction with M-26 near Greenland. The roadway runs through forest land and crosses several small streams while traveling southeasterly. Outside of Greenland, M-38 curves to the north around town after intersecting Plank Road. On the east side of town, M-26 and M-38 meet and join in a concurrency after Ontonagon–Greenland Road meets Plank Road a second time. The two highways run together for just over a mile to the unincorporated community of Lake Mine. There, M-38 turns south through the community while M-26 turns off to the northeast.\nThe highway crosses a set of railroad tracks before turning east. At Post Office Road, M-38 meets a road named Old M-35 Road, a vestige of a highway straightening project during the time the highway was M-35. M-38 crosses the West Branch of the Firesteel River in hilly terrain through this area. The highway continues east and provides access to the Courtney Lake National Forest Campground west of the Houghton County line. East of Federal Forest Highway 16 (FFH-16) near Nisula, M-38 crosses the West Branch of the Otter River. It is along this section of roadway in Houghton County that the lowest annual average daily traffic (AADT) counts were measured by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 2007. An average of 680 vehicles traveled on the roadway, according to MDOT surveys. Of those vehicles, only 40 trucks on average were included in the traffic counts. East of Nisula, the roadway runs parallel to Mill Creek. Mill Creek flows into the West Branch of the Sturgeon River near the Baraga County line.\n\nEast of the county line is the crossing over the Sturgeon River south of Pelkie, home of the Baraga County Fairgrounds. The trunkline crosses more hilly terrain while veering to the northeast. Continuing to the east, M-38 had its highest traffic usage in 2007. The AADT for the Baraga County segment of the highway was measured at 3,000 vehicles a day. The roadway continues east through Baraga County and runs downhill approaching Baraga and the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, home of the first Native American casino in the United States. After passing through downtown Baraga on Michigan Avenue, M-38 ends at an intersection with US 41; on the western shore of Keweenaw Bay.\n\nThe first version of M-38 was designated in 1919 in the Lower Peninsula. It was located on Junction Road from M-10 (later US 10/US 23) southeast of Bridgeport to Frankenmuth, and then ran east to M-19 in the Peck area in 1919. The highway was transferred to county jurisdiction in late 1961 when Interstate 75 (I-75) was completed in the area.\n\nIn January 1969, the Michigan Department of State Highways redesignated the western section of M-35 as M-38. M-35 was originally planned to start in Menominee and run north to Big Bay, turn west through the Huron Mountains in northern Marquette County and run west from Baraga to Ontonagon. The Huron Mountains portion of M-35 was never built due to opposition from Henry Ford and the Huron Mountain Club. This left M-35 discontinuous. It was later routed along US 41 from Negaunee to Baraga, connecting the two sections until the western section was given the M-38 designation.\n\nThe original routing of M-38 in the Upper Peninsula ran from M-26 at Greenland to Baraga. US 45 was rerouted in 1971 along M-26 from Rockland to Greenland and Ontonagon–Greenland Road between those two towns. M-26 was shortened to end at the new US 45 in Greenland. This change to US 45 was reversed in 1973. M-26 was re-extended to Rockland, and M-38 was extended along M-26 to Ontonagon–Greenland Road to meet US 45 in Ontonagon.\n\nOn October 11, 2006, the western terminus of M-38 was relocated about south to end at a junction with US 45 and the newly realigned M-64.\n\n"}
{"id": "1890023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890023", "title": "Video game packaging", "text": "Video game packaging\n\nVideo game packaging refers to the physical storage of the contents of a PC or console game, both for safekeeping and shop display. In the past, a number of materials and packaging designs were used, mostly paperboard or plastic. Today, most console and PC games are shipped in (CD) jewel cases or (DVD) keep cases, with little differences between them.\n\nAside from the actual game, many items may be included inside, such as an instruction booklet, teasers of upcoming games, subscription offers to magazines, other advertisements, or any hardware that may be needed for any extra features of the game.\n\nEarly machines such as the Commodore 64 were tape-based, and hence had their games distributed on ordinary cassettes. When more advanced machines moved to floppy disks, the cassette boxes stayed in use for a while (e.g. \"Treasure Island Dizzy\" for the Amiga came on a floppy disk in a cassette box).\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, computer games became significantly more complex, and the market for them expanded enormously. Possibly in an effort to occupy more shelf space than their rivals, and attract attention with their cover art, games began to be sold in large cardboard boxes. There was no standard size, but most were around 20 cm x 15 cm x 5 cm (around 8in x 6in x 2in). The greatly increasing box sizes may have been justified in some cases. Games such as flight simulators came with extremely large, thick manuals. Others came with elaborate copy-protection systems such as Zool's circular code wheel, or even a hardware dongle (although these were generally more common on expensive non-game software).\n\nVariations on the \"big box\" format include a box within a sleeve, such as \"Unreal\", and a box with a fold-out front cover, such as \"Black & White\".\n\nGames re-released as budget games usually came in much smaller boxes—a common format for Amiga budget games was a thin square box roughly 13 cm x 13 cm x 2 cm (roughly 5in x 5in x 1in). It was during this time that covermounting of cassettes and floppy discs became common.\n\nAs PC games migrated to CDs in jewel cases, the large format box remained, though to reduce printing costs, manuals came on the CD as well as with the CD (inside the front cover), as did many of the copy-protection techniques in the form of SafeDisc and SecuROM. Despite the CD jewel case format having been around since the invention of the music CD, very few full-price PC games were released in a jewel case only. A thicker variation with space for a thick manual was, however, used for most PlayStation and Dreamcast games.\n\nAround 2000, PC game packaging in Europe began to converge with that of PS2 (and later, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube) console games, in the keep case format in which to this day the vast majority of games are sold. These boxes are sometimes known as Amaray cases, after a popular manufacturer of them. In the U.S., most PC games continue to ship in plastic DVD cases or cardboard boxes, though the size of such boxes has been standardized to a small form factor. Special packages such as a \"Collector's Edition\" frequently still ship with oversized boxes, or those with a different material, such as a \"Steelbook\".\n\nIn the U.S., the IEMA played a major role in improving, from a retailer's perspective, the way most PC games are packaged. In 2000, many retailers were becoming disenchanted with the salability of PC games as compared with their more profitable console game counterparts as products. Oversized software boxes were blamed for a lack of productivity per square foot (the profitability of a particular item sold at retail based upon its foot print). The IEMA worked with leading game publishers in creating the now-standard IEMA-sized box, essentially a double-thick DVD-sized plastic or cardboard box, which effectively increased the profitability per square foot by over 33% and appeased merchants and developers alike. \"\" was one of the first PC games in the U.S. to come packaged in this new standardized box.\n\nIn creating the new box size the IEMA found itself in the unlikely position of platform guardian (where each console platform had a first-party publisher to oversee standardization matters, PC games by their very nature did not). As such, the industry pressured the organization to develop a platform identification mark which would unify the display and focus the customer's brand perception. Again the IEMA worked with publishers to create a new standard \"PC\" icon, and would provide its use on a royalty-free basis to the industry.\n\nIn 2004, \"Half-Life 2\" was made available for download over the Internet, via Steam. A physical boxed copy was also sold, though it also required activation over the Internet. Valve hoped this method of distribution would take off, as it delivers a greater percentage of the sale price to the game developer than boxed copies. Valve's belief was not unfounded, as Steam became the most common method of PC game distribution by late 2009: even earlier, internet distribution surpassed its physical counterpart, and as of mid-2011 is unchallenged. Many, if not most games by most publishers for the PC, not only Valve, are released as \"Steam\" electronic copies which regularly outsell physical copies. In addition, Steam's DRM remains one of the most secure available, but is very non-intrusive compared to schemes like SecuROM, which, in installing kernel-mode drivers (often somewhat inaccurately referred to as \"rootkits\"), are often incompatible with certain hardware configurations and many pieces of third-party security software (such as software firewalls and anti-virus applications), a problem that does not plague Steam. Steam also allows consumers to back up their copy of \"Half-Life 2\" as well as other games that are downloadable through Steam onto CDs or DVDs. To complement this feature many fans have created box coverings for jewel cases that can be downloaded and printed, giving birth to a wide variety of game packaging styles and designs.\n\nJava games for cellphones are distributed almost exclusively via the internet. It is possible that the proliferation of home broadband will lead to electronic distribution for all games in the future, leaving physical packaging a niche market, though game developers cite the unsolved problem of digital rights management as the main barrier to this.\n\nThe earliest consoles had game \"cartridges\"; the Intellivision cartridge packaging featured a box color-coded to the \"network\" or category of the game (one of several themes, such as \"action\", \"sports\", etc.). The front cover opened up, book style; on the inner front cover, a slot retained the paper manual – a simple booklet, as well as the poly controller overlays. In the main confines of the box, a plastic tray was recessed into which the cartridge fit snugly. When other companies began to produce cartridges for Mattel's system, other types of boxes began to appear, such as Imagic's simple cardboard box, which opened from the top to reveal simple cardboard retainers for the cartridge and rules booklet.\n\nUnlike PC games, console manufacturers charge a license fee to anyone developing for their machine, and exert a certain amount of influence in the style of packaging. Nintendo, for example, maintained almost completely standardized boxes for SNES games. PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and Xbox game boxes also conform to the keep case form factor.\n\nAll cases of PAL region games for PlayStation and Dreamcast are thicker than standard North American and Japanese CD-cases. This is due to thicker manuals that often include many European languages. An exception to this were Australian-market PlayStation games later in the console's life, which were released in standard-sized jewel cases with the manual in English only.\n\nGames for handheld systems are usually packaged in smaller boxes, to match the portable nature of the machine. The Game Boy Advance's cardboard boxes are a little smaller than SNES/N64 packaging, and games for the Nintendo DS and PSP both come in smaller, CD-like cases.\n\nWhile DVD-like boxes are common in the current generation of gaming, the original cardboard packaging used for past cartridge-based games is scarce, as they were often discarded by the original owner of the game. As such, many cartridge-based games bought in second hand markets often are missing their original boxes, and the boxes themselves are now viewed as collector items.\n\nPlayStation 3 games are packaged into Blu-ray keep cases. With some generations, standardised colours have been used for the edging.\n\nThe term box art (also called a game cover or cover art) can refer to the artwork on the front of PC or console game packaging. Box art is usually flashy and bombastic, in the vein of movie posters, and serves a similar purpose. Additionally, screenshots on the back of the box often mix in-game sequences with pre-rendered sections. Historically, art featured on the box has been in excess of what the computer or console was technically capable of displaying. Veteran San Francisco box art illustrator Marc Ericksen, who produced nearly 100 illustrations for video games from 1982 to 2003, including games like Tengen's Tetris, Capcom's Mega Man 2, Atari 7800's Galaga, Data East's Bad Dudes, and SNK's Guerrilla War contends that there was very little in the screen graphics to sell the games. The sales arms needed illustrations to introduce a visual construct to acquaint young gamers to the gameplay concepts. The graphics were exciting when in motion, but offered very little to engage a prospective purchaser's attention when \n\nstatic. Illustrators were less frequently required beyond the year 2000, when screen graphics reached parity with illustrations and could be utilized as cover art.\n\nBox art may misleadingly depict gameplay. Weekly Reader Software in 1983 advertised \"Old Ironsides\" with the slogan \"What you see is what you get!\", promising that \"Unlike other programs, where the pictures on the packaging and in the advertising bear no resemblance to the screen images, this program delivers precisely what's promised ... Better than arcade-quality graphics and sound!\". Cinemaware advertised \"Defender of the Crown\" in 1987 with screenshots that the company described as being an \"Actual Atari ST screen!\", \"Actual Apple IIGS screen!\", \"Actual Macintosh screen!\", and \"Actual Commodore 64 screen!\". Deceptions continued, however; \"Computer Gaming World\" in 1994 stated that \"Careful consumers have learned to spot screen shots on a box that are probably just animation sequences, not really a play shot\".\n\nOn the cover, many things are listed, such as the name and logo of the game, what platform the game is for, the rating (ESRB for North America, PEGI for Europe and CERO for Japan), logo of the publisher and/or developer, and quotes from magazines or websites.\n\nAs part of the marketing effort to build hype, box art is usually released a few months before the actual game.\n\nMany people find particular box art strange, or poor, such as \"Phalanx\" and \"Mega Man.\" Often this is the result of art used for a localized version of an import title. Many early releases, especially Nintendo, replaced Japanese art with original US artwork, such as the \"Dragon Warrior\" and the \"Final Fantasy\" series. Recent import titles have made it a habit to retain the original cover art.\n\nThe boxes of Nintendo games (NES, Game Boy, Nintendo 64, Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo DS, Wii, Nintendo 3DS and Wii U) from PAL territories all have a small coloured triangle on their spines, but in each territory it's a different colour (to show the region that copy of the game came from). \nSome common ones are: Green = UK, Pink = Spain, Red = France, Light Blue = Italy, Dark Blue = Germany, Brown = Australia.\nThere are 49 different colours. As well as geographic region it also has to do with the language of the box art and booklets; though PAL region Nintendo games are made in Germany, the triangles show the region that the game is shipped to.\n\nAn instruction manual, a booklet that instructs the player on how to play the game, is usually included as part of a video game package. Manuals can be large, such as the \"Civilization II\" manual which runs hundreds of pages, or small, such as the single sheet of double-sided A5 paper included with \"Half-Life 2\".\n\nPAL region versions of games may include thick manuals with many languages. For example, the European manual of \"\" for PlayStation includes six languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Dutch.\n\nComputer games typically have larger manuals because some genres native to personal computers such as simulators or strategy games require a more in-depth explanation of the interface and game mechanics. Furthermore, instruction manuals for personal computer games tend to include installation instructions to assist a user in installing the game, but those instructions could also appear in a separate piece of paper or in a different leaflet. As some of these manuals are so large as to be cumbersome when searching for a specific section, some games include a quick reference card (usually a list of keyboard commands) on a separate sheet of paper or in the back cover of the manual.\n\nA common use for printed manuals until the CD-ROM became the main medium for games was to use it as a copy protection device: some games required the player to find the \"\"word x in the y paragraph of the z page\"\" or to input a code found in the borders of a certain page. These mechanisms were highly unpopular, as they only affected legitimate purchasers; pirates would simply use a crack or have the codes printed on a single sheet to bypass the mechanism. While this practice has fallen out of use in recent years, CD-keys serve a similar purpose and are occasionally printed somewhere in or on the manual.\n\nOther manuals go much farther than being simple guides: some games based on historical or well-developed fictional stories often include extensive information about the settings, like the WWI combat simulator \"Flying Corps\", where every campaign was thoroughly described with historical information. In some genres, this led to the aforementioned large manuals traditional with computer games.\n\nThe trend in recent years is towards smaller manuals – sometimes just a single instruction sheet – for a number of reasons. Console games are no longer sold in large cardboard boxes; instead, since the early 2000s, DVD cases have been used (as today's major consoles use DVD-sized optical discs), which leave no room for a large manual. Printing is also expensive, and game publishers can save money by including a PDF of the manual on the disc (for PC games). Notably, most video games produced during and after the fourth generation include in-game instructions via tutorials and other such methods, meaning printed manuals are often overlooked.\nHowever, this trend is unpopular among many video game collectors because it may decrease the perceived value of game, as manuals are sometimes considered works of art themselves as an essential part of the game's packaging. Some consider reading manuals an enjoyable experience. Also, reading manuals on a computer monitor or other display device may be considered more \"awkward\" as opposed to printed paper.\n\nAs opposed to most console games which have printed manuals, games for the Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Vita and Wii U store manuals in digital form on the Nintendo 3DS game card, PlayStation Vita game card and Wii U optical disc respectively.\n\nWhile their use in PC games post-2000 is scarce, console games and older PC games are expected to have them. Games acquired in second-hand markets often miss the manuals, much like missing their original boxes, after being kept, lost or discarded by their previous owners. As occasionally the manuals are part of the game experience, owners of games missing manuals try to find replacements in other second-hand stores or with other players or collectors. Alternatively, sites like Replacementdocs provide a large repository of fan-made and official PDF manuals to download. Those range from simple page scans (which is impractical in longer manuals, due to larger file size and the inability to search text) to OCR-scanned and carefully assembled manuals to remain as close to the original manuals as possible.\n\nMMORPGs in particular continue to be packaged with a comprehensive and high-quality manual. \"World of Warcraft\" and \"Guild Wars\" include instruction manuals that are 150 to 200 pages; they explain everything from in-game lore to detailed overviews of the different character classes. In general, MMORPGs have a larger variety of features in which the player can focus on while playing than normal games and often take much longer to semi-complete (usually defined as reaching the highest-possible character level: due to the nature of MMORPG games, with constant content additions, etc., requiring many hours of weekly play in order to stay competitive in-game, it is impossible to ever \"complete\", \"finish\" or \"beat\" one in the traditional sense one can complete a game like \"Final Fantasy X\" or \"\"). The detailed instruction booklets that accompany the games help answer any questions that players may have in order to make public relations and technical support easier once the game is released. These manuals also invite potential players to explore an aspect of the game that was previously unknown to them. More than any other genre, the community and longevity of an MMO are important to the developers because they often charge a monthly fee for playing the game.\n\n"}
{"id": "1890029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890029", "title": "Rhinoceros hornbill", "text": "Rhinoceros hornbill\n\nThe rhinoceros hornbill (\"Buceros rhinoceros\") is a large species of forest hornbill (Bucerotidae). In captivity it can live for up to 35 years. It is found in lowland and montane, tropical and subtropical climates and in mountain rain forests up to 1,400 metres in Borneo, Sumatra, Java, the Malay Peninsula, Singapore, and southern Thailand.\n\nThe rhinoceros hornbill is the state bird of the Malaysian state of Sarawak and the country's National Bird. Some Dayak people, especially the Ibanic groups, believe it to be the chief of worldly birds or the supreme worldly bird, and its statue is used to welcome the god of the augural birds, Sengalang Burong, to the feasts and celebrations of humankind. Contrary to some misunderstandings, the rhinoceros hornbill does not represent their war god, who is represented in this world by the brahminy kite. It is featured on the reverse of the 5 Malaysian ringgit bill.\n\nThe rhinoceros hornbill is a large arboreal hornbill, long. The weight varies by sex, with males weighing around and the females . The plumage is predominately black, with white legs and vent and a white tail with a black band. The huge bill and casque are orange and red, the colour coming from preen oil rubbed on from the preen gland above the tail. The eyes of the male are red with black rims, and white with red rims in the female.\n\nThe diet of the rhinoceros hornbill is dominated by fruit, but it will take any insect, small reptile, rodent, and smaller birds that it can catch.\n\nThe courtship and bonding of these birds are critical, as the female must trust the male to provide her with everything when she is incubating and raising chicks. These hornbills make their nests inside tree trunks, and the female stays inside with the eggs and then with the chicks, while the male brings them food. After the eggs are laid, the male collects mud, and the pair pack that mud, along with food and feces, to wall up the entrance to the tree cavity. They leave a very small hole, just large enough for the male to feed the female, and later the chicks, and for the female to defecate through the hole. Once the chicks are fully feathered and old enough to leave the nest, the parents chip away the dry mud to let the chicks out.\n\nThe rhinoceros hornbill faces a number of threats, including loss of its rainforest habitat, as well as hunting for its meat, and its skull and feathers. Habitat destruction has led to the loss of the large trees the species requires for breeding, which in turn makes it easier for poachers to find the rhinoceros hornbill. It is frequently shot at by poachers due to confusion with the highly sought-after helmeted hornbill. Due to this, the species was uplisted to vulnerable from near threatened on the IUCN Red List in 2018.\n\n"}
{"id": "1890036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890036", "title": "Vehicle registration plates of Croatia", "text": "Vehicle registration plates of Croatia\n\nThe standard license plates in Croatia consist of a two-letter city code which is separated by the Coat of Arms of Croatia from three or four numbers and one or two letters.\n\nThe standard regular plate consists of three or four randomly assigned numbers, one or two randomly assigned letters, and the first two letters indicate the city, separated by the Croatian Coat of Arms, while the numbers and the last letters are separated by a dash (example; ZG 000-A, ZG 000-AA, ZG 0000-A or ZG 0000-AA). Since Croatia entered the European Union in 2013, there have been proposals to permanently change the design scheme (consisting of new letter font and ideas to replace the Coat of Arms with four red squares). However, in July 2016, it was determined to keep the original design and add the blue EU-issued sticker (as standard with EU member states). The design of Croatian license plates comes from old Yugoslavian license plates from the 1980s, and it remained the same (with a notable difference of switching the red star, Yugoslavian national symbol, with the Coat of Arms).\n\nThere is also a possibility of having a customized plate for a fee. One type of customized plate looks exactly like the standard ones, with the exception that the combination of numbers and letters is personally chosen by the vehicle's owner. The other kind of customized plates can consist of a word with from four to seven letters or a combination of the word with four or five letters and one or two numbers. However, these plates are still quite rare in Croatia, mostly because they can only be used for five years after the first registration and they also require a fee of 2,000 kuna (cca 270 euros).\n\nThere are also some special plates. While the numbers and letters on standard license plates are colored black, plates for foreign citizens permanently living in Croatia, international organizations and temporary registered vehicles have green numbers and letters. On the plates used on bigger trucks and other vehicles that can be oversized for some of the smaller roads, the numbers and letters are red.\n\nThe police vehicles are equipped with the plates consisting of six numbers divided in two groups and separated by the Coat of Arms of Croatia, blue numbers. The first group of numbers denote the police department to which the vehicle belongs. While the background on all of these plates is colored white, on those used on military vehicles it is yellow. However, the system of dividing numbers and letters is the same as on the standard plates, but instead of a city code there are letters HV for \"Hrvatska vojska\" (Croatian military). At the same time, specialized military vehicles have the letters VP for \"vojna policija\" or MP for \"military police\" (military police) as the final two letters.\nPlates for diplomatic representatives (embassies, consulates) are blue with yellow numbers and letters. The first three number denote the country, followed by letter A, C, or M, then serial number of the vehicle.\n\nAs opposed to all above mentioned plates that are made of metal, the dealer's test plates are stickers that are attached to the plate holder. These plates consist of a city code separated by the coat of arms from five numbers divided in two groups and they can be used for a limited number of days.\n\nStarting from 2008 onwards, special plates with an additional two letters (PP or PV) were introduced, PP stands for \"prijenosne pločice\" (transferable plates) and PV stands for \"povijesno vozilo\" (historical vehicle) in a form CC-PV-NNN(N).\n\nAlso from 2008 onwards, export plates are introduced, with RH standing for Republika Hrvatska, and a green background with yellow numbers and letters. Croatia's Ministry of Internal Affairs proposed new licence plates with the EU stars.\n\nNational Defense plates had letters NZ and numbers. These plates had been discontinued long after the Independent State of Croatia (1941–45) ceased exist.\n"}
{"id": "1890041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890041", "title": "Haile Melekot", "text": "Haile Melekot\n\nHaile Malakot (1824 – 9 November 1855) was \"Negus\" of Shewa, a historical region of Ethiopia, from 12 October 1847 until his death. He was the older son of \"Negus\" Sahle Selassie and his wife Woizero Bezabish Wolde. Haile Melekot was half-brother to Darge Sahle Selassie.\n\nHis first wife was Woizero Ejigayehu (whom he married in 1844 and divorced in 1845); their one child, baptised Sahle Mariam, was renamed Menelik by Negus Sahle Selassie. Her background is disputed; some believe she was of Oromo origin, others insist that she was among the ladies who were brought from the Imperial court at Gondar to Ankober to instruct the royal women of Shewa on court etiquette so that the Shewan branch of the dynasty could adopt the same court practices as the elder Gondar branch. In May 1845 he married his second wife, Woizero Tideneqialesh, who was a former wife of a court official.\n\nHaile Melekot was known as Lij Besha Warad before he became king. It was well known that Sahle Selassie favored his younger son, Seyfe Sahle Selassie, and it was widely rumored that he would make his younger son his heir. However, he publicly announced that Haile Melekot would inherit the kingdom, had Seyfe swear to abide by this decision, and although mortally ill shortly before his death travelled to Debre Berhan where he asked his vassal Oromo lords to remain loyal to Haile Melekot.\n\nNonetheless, in Mordechai Abir's words, Sahle Selassie's death \"was a signal for a blood bath which surpassed anything that ever occurred in the annals of Showa.\" The Abichu Oromo rose in open revolt, attempting to recover control of the district of Tegulet and came close to capturing the capital of Ankober. Only the loyalty of some of the other Oromo chiefs and the Shewan supply of firearms saved the capital. Haile Melekot afterwards managed to persuade the meet with him at Angolalla, where he persuaded them to end their revolt. By the beginning of 1848, he was firmly in control of his kingdom, and even organized a campaign against the Arsi Oromo, who had been raiding the south-western parts of Shewa for years.\n\nHarold Marcus notes that \"little is known or remembered of the reign of Sahle Selassie's son, except for its end.\" While he is likely correct in stating that this lack of information \"leads one to believe that his reign was undistinguished\", one brief letter of Haile Melekot survives, undated but written in the spring of 1849 and addressed to \"Victoria, Queen of the Ferangi\" – i.e. the Europeans. According to Sven Rubenson, it was delivered by an Ethiopian pilgrim to the British consul at Cairo, who was on his way to Jerusalem; the pilgrim also informed the consul that a gift consisting of 26 elephant tusks and 31 rhinoceros horns were en route to the British at Aden. Although it was agreed that the pilgrim would stop on his return travel to pick up the British response, he was never seen again.\n\nIn this letter, Haile Melekot refers to the friendship between the United Kingdom and Shewa, asks why they did not send a servant on his father's death to bring condolences and for 1,500 Thalers, with a verbal message by the courier asking for skilled workmen. Misunderstanding the intent of this letter (and not for the last time the British government misunderstood Ethiopian customs), Lord Palmerston responded on 4 July 1849 that Shewa lay too far away to send any workmen \"and, moreover, the workmen in her dominions are at present much employed.\" With this letter a chest containing 300 sovereigns was sent; this gift was returned with a second letter containing the accusation that the coins were not made of gold but brass, and concluding, \"Even if our friendship is gone, let there not be enmity between us.\"\n\nRubenson interprets this communication as evidence of Shewan \"aloofness and suspicion\" of European attention.He notes that the letter was sent not under the royal name of Haile Melekot, but as \"Basad Wirad\", the name he used before his coronation, and was most familiar to the Europeans visiting Shewa in his father's time knew him. The ruler, or at least his secretary, was unclear which country Victoria was queen over. As for the return of the coins, Rubenson believes \"it is more likely that the King was prevented from accepting the gift by the same anti-European forces that had compelled Krapf and Harris to give up Shewa. Whatever the reason, the incident shows how difficult it was to create confidence and establish anythiing resembling ordinary diplomatic relations.\"\n\nInevitably, Haile Melekot's semi-independent kingdom (the Emperor of Ethiopia in Gondar was still nominally the liege lord of the King of Shewa) came to the attention of Tewodros II, a regional lord of Gonder, who successfully concluding the process of defeating the remaining local rulers (princes) of Ethiopia and reuniting Ethiopia. Haile Melekot allied himself with the Oromo in the province Wollo, which lay between him and Tewodros, but as Abir notes, he \"was not made of the same stuff his father was, and could not provide the same inspiring leadership which had made Showa strong in the past.\" The Shewan army failed to provide any effective help to the Oromo leaders in Wollo, and with an army of 50,000 men, Tewodros crushed his divided opposition. After a pause for the rainy season, Tewodros then entered northern Shewa in 1855.\n\nBy this point Haile Melekot was discouraged and gravely sick. His brother Seyfe, dissatisfied with his indecision, led the army south from Wollo to Menz then to Tegulet, abandoning Haile Melekot. The local governors were no match for the Emperor, and either were defeated or (like the governor of Efrata) went over to Tewodros' side. Rebellious Oromo burned Angolalla. The Negus of Shewa was horrified to learn that his mother Bezabish and his grandmother Zenebework (respectively widow and mother of the late Sahle Selassie) had crossed to the camp of Tewodros II and paid him homage in exchange for a guarantee that their personal lands would not be touched. A despondent Haile Melekot made a few skirmishes against Tewodros' forces, then destroyed his food stores and his capital of Ankober to keep it out of Tewodros' hands. He died of his illness in the town of Atakelt, and was hastily buried at Debre Gage in Tara.\n\nA handful of Shewan nobles fought on, until a final battle in Bulga, where they were defeated by a detachment of Tewodros' troops under Ras Ingida. Accepting that further resistance was not possible, they delivered Menelik, the son and heir of Haile Melekot, to Tewodros. Emperor Tewodros appointed Haile Melekot's brother Haile Mikael governor, and the independence of Shewa came to an end.\n\nIn an interesting postscript, Tewodros II is said to have disbelieved that Haile Melekot was really dead and demanded that his body be disinterred. When he saw the body of the dead king, the Emperor is said to have wept for him, saying it was a shame that illness should deny a brave man such as the King of Shewa, the honor of falling in battle. He ordered that Haile Melekot be re-buried with all the pomp and ceremony due to a king.\n\n"}
{"id": "1890042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890042", "title": "Five Ws", "text": "Five Ws\n\nThe Five Ws (sometimes referred to as Five Ws and How, 5W1H, or Six Ws) are questions whose answers are considered basic in information gathering or problem solving. They are often mentioned in journalism (\"cf.\" news style), research and police investigations. According to the principle of the Five Ws, a report can only be considered complete if it answers these questions starting with an interrogative word:\n\nSome authors add a sixth question, \"how\", to the list.\n\nEach question should have a factual answer—facts necessary to include for a report to be considered complete. Importantly, none of these questions can be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom (excluding Scotland), the Five Ws are used in Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 lessons (ages 7–14).\n\nThe Five Ws and How were long attributed to Hermagoras of Temnos. But in 2010, Michael C. Sloan established Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics as the source of the elements of circumstance or \"Septem Circumstantiae\". Thomas Aquinas had much earlier acknowledged Aristotle as the originator of the elements of circumstances, providing a detailed commentary on Aristotle's system in his \"Treatise on human acts\" and specifically in part one of two Q7 \"Of the Circumstances of Human Acts\". Thomas Aquinas examines the concept of Aristotle's voluntary and involuntary action in his \"Summa Theologiae\" as well as a further set of questions about the elements of circumstance. Primarily he asks \"Whether a circumstance is an accident of a human act\" (Article 1), \"Whether Theologians should take note of the circumstances of human acts?\" (Article 2), \"Whether the circumstances are properly set forth (in Aristotle's) third book of Ethics\" (Article 3) and \"Whether the most important circumstances are 'Why' and 'In What the act consists'?\" (Article 4).\n\nFor in acts we must take note of \"who\" did it, by what aids or instruments he did it (\"with\"), \"what\" he did, \"where\" he did it, \"why\" he did it, \"how\" and \"when\" he did it.\n\nFor Aristotle, the elements are used in order to distinguish voluntary or involuntary action.\n\nBecause Aristotle employs this schema as a primordial crucible for defining the difference between voluntary and involuntary agents (a topic of incalculable importance in the works of Aristotle), the benefits of locating this schema within Aristotle, and ultimately providing clarification of the passage, \"may prove helpful to a number of disciplines\" (Sloan 2010, 236).\n\nThese elements of circumstances are used by Aristotle as a framework to describe and evaluate moral action in terms of What was/should be done, Who did it, How it was done, Where it happened, and most importantly for what reason (Why), and so on for all the other elements. He outlines them as follows in the Ethics as translated by Sloan.\n\nTherefore it is not a pointless endeavor to divide these circumstances by kind and number; (1) the \"Who\", (2) the \"What\", (3) around what place (\"Where\") or (4) in which time something happens (\"When\"), and sometimes (5) with what, such as an instrument (\"With\"), (6) for the sake of what (\"Why\"), such as saving a life, and (7) the (\"How\"), such as gently or violently…And it seems that the most important circumstances are those just listed, including the \"Why\".\n\nFor Aristotle (in Sloan), ignorance of any of these elements can imply involuntary action.\n\nThus, with ignorance as a possibility concerning all these things, that is, \"the circumstances of the act\", the one who acts in ignorance of any of them seems to act involuntarily, and especially regarding the most important ones. And it seems that the most important circumstances are those just listed, including the \"Why\"\n\nIn the Politics, Aristotle illustrates why the elements are important in terms of human (moral) action.\n\nI mean, for instance (a particular circumstance or movement or action), How could we advise the Athenians whether they should go to war or not, if we did not know their strength (\"How much\"), whether it was naval or military or both (\"What kind\"), and how great it is (\"How many\"), what their revenues amount to (\"With\"), Who their friends and enemies are (\"Who\"), what wars, too they have waged (\"What\"), and with what success; and so on.\n\nEssentially, these elements of circumstances provide a theoretical framework that can be used to particularize, explain or predict \"any\" given set of circumstances of action. Hermagoras went so far as to claim that \"all\" hypotheses are derived from these seven circumstances.\n\nIn other words, no hypothetical question, or question involving particular persons and actions, can arise without reference to these circumstances, and no demonstration of such a question can be made without using them.\n\nIn any particular act or situation, one needs to interrogate these questions in order to determine the actual circumstances of the action.\n\nIt is necessary for students of virtue to differentiate between the Voluntary and Involuntary; such a distinction should even prove useful to the lawmaker for assigning honors and punishments.\n\nThis aspect is encapsulated by Aristotle in Rhetoric as \"forensic speech\" and is used to determine \"\"The characters and circumstances which lead men to commit wrong, or make them the victims of wrong\"\" in order to accuse or defend. It is this application of the elements of circumstances that was emphasised by latter rhetoricians.\n\nEven though the classical origin of these questions as situated in ethics had long been lost, they have been a standard way of formulating or analyzing rhetorical questions since antiquity. The rhetor Hermagoras of Temnos, as quoted in pseudo-Augustine's \"De Rhetorica\", applied Aristotle's \"elements of circumstances\" (μόρια περιστάσεως) as the loci of an issue:\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas also refers to the elements as used by Cicero in De Inventione (Chap. 24 DD1, 104) as:\"Quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando.\"Similarly, Quintilian discussed \"loci argumentorum\", but did not put them in the form of questions.\n\nVictorinus explained Cicero's application of the elements of circumstances by putting them into correspondence with Hermagoras's questions:\nJulius Victor also lists circumstances as questions.\n\nBoethius \"made the seven circumstances fundamental to the arts of prosecution and defense\":\n\nThe question form was taken up again in the 12th century by Thierry de Chartres and John of Salisbury.\n\nTo administer suitable penance to sinners, the 21st canon of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) enjoined confessors to investigate both sins and the circumstances of the sins. The question form was popular for guiding confessors, and it appeared in several different forms:\n\nThe method of questions was also used for the systematic exegesis of a text.\n\nIn the 16th century, Thomas Wilson wrote in English verse:\nIn the United States in the 19th century, Prof. William Cleaver Wilkinson popularized the \"Three Ws\" – What? Why? What of it? – as a method of Bible study in the 1880s, although he did not claim originality. This would also became the \"Five Ws\", but the application was rather different from that in journalism:\n\n\"What? Why? What of it?\" is a plan of study of alliterative methods for the teacher emphasized by Professor W.C. Wilkinson not as original with himself but as of venerable authority. \"It is, in fact,\" he says, \"an almost immemorial orator's analysis. First the facts, next the proof of the facts, then the consequences of the facts. This analysis has often been expanded into one known as \"The Five Ws\": \"When? Where? Who? What? Why?\" Hereby attention is called, in the study of any lesson: to the date of its incidents; to their place or locality; to the person speaking or spoken to, or to the persons introduced, in the narrative; to the incidents or statements of the text; and, finally, to the applications and uses of the lesson teachings.\n\nThe \"Five Ws\" (and one H) were memorialized by Rudyard Kipling in his \"Just So Stories\" (1902), in which a poem, accompanying the tale of \"The Elephant's Child\", opens with:\n\nBy 1917, the \"Five Ws\" were being taught in high-school journalism classes, and by 1940, the tendency of journalists to address all of the \"Five Ws\" within the lead paragraph of an article was being characterized as old-fashioned and fallacious:\n\nStarting in the 2000s, the Five Ws were sometimes misattributed to Kipling, especially in the management and quality literature, and contrasted with the Five whys.\n\nIn each of English and Latin, most of the interrogative words begin with the same sound, \"wh\" in English, \"qu\" in Latin. This is not a coincidence, as they are cognates derived from the Proto-Indo-European root \"ko-\", reflected in Proto-Germanic as \"χa-\" or \"kha-\" and in Latin as \"qu-\".\n\n"}

Released on September 15, 1971, it was the first album on David Geffen's Asylum label. Backing musicians include John Beck and Jim Pons from the Leaves. While the majority of the album was produced by Henry Lewy, Graham Nash handled the duties for the single \"Jesus Was a Cross Maker\", with his production designed to aim for radio airplay.\n\nIn 2017 Intervention Records reissued Judee Sill on 180-gram double 45RPM vinyl. The reissue earned a score of 10 for sound quality from noted vinyl critic Michael Fremer.\n\nSill had played piano since her childhood, and honed her skills at reform school in the early 1960s where she was sent for forging checks. After a drugs bust, Sill spent time in jail where she kicked her heroin addiction and made a promise to pursue a songwriting career.\n\nThe songs that appear on \"Judee Sill\" were mostly composed in 1969–71. In 1969, Sill was hired by the Turtles to write songs for $35 a week for their publishing company, Blimp Music. The earliest of these are \"Lady-O,\" which was recorded by the band, \"Crayon Angels,\" \"My Man on Love,\" \"Lopin' Along Thru the Cosmos,\" \"Enchanted Sky Machines,\" and \"Abracadabra.\"\n\nThe latest additions to the album were \"The Archetypal Man,\" \"Ridge Rider,\" and the single \"Jesus was a Cross Maker.\" Originally, two other new songs, \"The Pearl\" and \"The Phoenix,\" were slated for inclusion, but were removed from the track list to make room for \"Jesus was a Cross Maker.\" They were re-recorded and appeared on Sill's second album, \"Heart Food\", in 1973.\n\nMusically, the songs are delivered in an acoustic style on guitar and, for \"Jesus was a Cross Maker\" and \"Enchanted Sky Machines,\" piano. The songs, after work by Sill and Lewy, feature elements of pop, folk, country, and gospel, but also strong classical influences. Two of Sill's biggest influences were Bach and Ray Charles. Lyrically, Sill's songs follow a theme of finding redemption.\n\nSill began touring as an opening act in late 1970, a year before the release of \"Judee Sill\". Her first major tour was with Crosby & Nash, and she also opened for Cat Stevens, Gordon Lightfoot and Tom Paxton. A full opening-act performance, recorded on October 3, 1971, in Boston in support of Crosby & Nash, appears on the Rhino reissue of \"Judee Sill\". The set was recorded two days after the release of the \"Jesus was a Cross Maker\" single.\n\nSill did not enjoy working as a support act. She told \"NME\" in April 1972: \"At the start it was hell. As I walked on stage I used to think, \"Oh God I'd rather die than do this. I'd rather stick a knife in my heart than go out and say, \"Nice to be here!\" Unfortunately, sometimes I've played with rock groups which is - urrrrrgh - terrible, ridiculous in fact. If somebody is ready to hear rock and roll they're ready to have a certain part of their mind or body stimulated. It's asking too much of anybody to suddenly switch round and have another part of them stimulated by something else.\" \n\nAll tracks arranged and composed by Judee Sill.\n\n\n\nCass Elliot covered \"Jesus Was A Crossmaker\" on her eponymous fourth studio album in 1972.\n\nWarren Zevon covered \"Jesus Was A Crossmaker\" on his 1995 album \"Mutineer\".\n\n\"Jesus Was A Crossmaker\" was also covered by the Hollies. A version by Rachael Yamagata was featured in the opening credits of the Cameron Crowe film \"Elizabethtown\".\n\nJackie Leven wrote and recorded a tribute to Sill in 2006 entitled \"The Silver In Her Crucifix\" on his recent album \"Oh What A Blow That Phantom Dealt Me\".\n\nRobin Pecknold, lead singer of Fleet Foxes, often performs \"Crayon Angels\" during the band's live shows.\n\nIn 2007 Canadian singer Lori Cullen covered the song \"Lopin' Along Thu The Cosmos\" on her CD \"Buttercup Bugle\".\n"}
{"id": "1890050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890050", "title": "Sloop period", "text": "Sloop period\n\nThe Sloop Period is a period in Faroese history, where the Faroese society transformed from a feudal society to a semi-industrial society. The period spans from the 1880s to the beginning of World War II.\n\nThe name of the period comes from the fact, that a lot of Faroese persons bought used sloops, mainly smacks, from the UK, and this gave an uprise in fishery on the islands. A smack is called \"slupp\" in Faroese, from the English word sloop. The Faroe Islands got their first fishing fleet. These fishing vessels were fishing from spring to autumn mainly in the waters around Iceland. Faroese women got an opportunity to earn money for the first time, when they went to work in the fish industry on land, the fish which the sloops brought to land. The sloops were fishing cod, which was dried and salted, also known as \"klippfisk\" because they were often dried by lying on bare rocks.\n\nThere are still two smacks from the Sloop period in the Faroe Islands, which are still sailing, but nowadays mainly for pleasure trips. The smack \"Johanna\" TG 326 from Vágur, was built in Rye, East Sussex in 1884, sold to Grimsby in October 1894 and to Jákup Dahl in Vágur on Suðuroy in December 1894. It was in active fishery until 1972. In 1981 it was in very bad shape and sold for 1 DKK to the local fond named after the smack \"Johanna\" TG 326. They collected money in order to restore the vessel and they managed to get it back into its original shape. In Tórhavn they have maintained the smack \"Westward Ho\" TN 54, which was built in Grimsby in 1884 and sold to T.F. Thomsen in Tvøroyri in Suðuroy in 1894. The name was \"Westward Ho\" from the beginning in England until 1895. From 1895-1908 it was named \"Viking\", and since 1908 it has been called \"Westward Ho\". Since the smack came to the Faroe Islands it has been fishing in the waters near Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Jan Mayen, Bear Island (Norway), Rockall.\n"}
{"id": "1890052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890052", "title": "Orthonychidae", "text": "Orthonychidae\n\nThe logrunners (Orthonyx) are a clade of birds which comprises three species of passerine birds endemic to Australia and New Guinea. Some authorities consider the Australian family Cinclosomatidae to be part of the Orthonychidae. The three species use their stiffened tails to brace themselves when feeding.\n\nThe Australian logrunner, \"Orthonyx temminckii\", is from northeastern New South Wales and southeast Queensland, where it is very local in its distribution, and strictly terrestrial in its habits. The wings are barred with white, and the chin, throat and breast are in the male pure white, but of a bright reddish-orange in the female. The remiges are very short, rounded and much incurved, showing a bird of weak flight. The rectrices are very broad, the shafts stiff, and towards the tip divested of barbs. The population which is found locally in New Guinea is now generally considered a separate species, the Papuan logrunner, \"Orthonyx novaeguineae\".\n\nThe chowchilla, \"Orthonyx spaldingii\", from north-east Queensland, is much larger than either species of logrunner, and has a jet-black plumage, the throat being white in the male and orange-rufous in the female.\n\nThe fossil record does not much help to determine the affiliations of the Orthonychidae. Three prehistoric species are known to science. The very large \"Orthonyx hypsilophus\" from Fossil Cave and an undescribed species found in Pyramids Cave which was a bit smaller than the Australian logrunner are probably of Late Pleistocene age. \"Orthonyx kaldowinyeri\" is known from Middle or Late Miocene deposits of Riversleigh; it is the oldest and smallest species known to date (Boles, 1993).\n\nLogrunners are semi-terrestrial birds of weak flight. They are strictly carnivorous, with insects and larvae being their chief food, whilst the larger chowchilla will also eat small lizards. They find their food by digging in the soil, using their spiny tails as a support in the wet forest.\n\nLogrunners have a somewhat unusual social structure. They are basically monogamous, but male offspring are often retained on the natal territory for more than a year after fledging. Despite this, only the female ever feeds the young; the much larger males stay primarily for the purpose of territorial defence and protecting the female from predation. Similar patterns of retention of young without alloparental care also occur in the speckled warbler, the corvid genus \"Perisoreus\" and the bustard genus \"Eupodotis\".\n\nLike the lyrebirds, logrunners typically breed in the southern winter from June to September, though this is often extended depending on weather conditions by a month or more. Both the chowchilla and the Papuan logrunner lay only one egg, whilst the Australian logrunner typically lays two though a few reports exist of clutches of one or even three. The eggs are very unusual in their tubular shape, and are pure white in colour, whilst the incubation period is among the longest for any songbird. The young generally become independent of the female in two to two and a half weeks, which is an exceptionally short time for an insectivorous altricial Australian bird, where parental dependence of forty to sixty days post-fledging is typical. This is probably why, unlike in birds of drier habitats in Australia, alloparental care is superfluous for rearing young and may actually increase the risk of predation. The nests are domed and constructed entirely of sticks, and are located on the ground below a tree. They have special coverings to prevent the extremely heavy downpours typical of the eastern Australian coast from damaging the egg(s).\n\nMales are described as performing dancing antics like those of the lyrebirds.\n\nIn accordance with their nonseasonal, warm rainforest habitat, logrunners can be very long-lived. The chowchilla, the sole species with any banding data, has an average lifespan of around five years and has been known to live for seventeen.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1890057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890057", "title": "Liberty Broadcasting System", "text": "Liberty Broadcasting System\n\nThe Liberty Broadcasting System was a U.S. radio network of the late 1940s and early 1950s founded by Gordon McLendon, which mainly broadcast live recreations of Major League Baseball games, by following the action via Western Union ticker reports. The sound effects were very realistic, and many listeners were not aware the broadcasters were not announcing the action live. At that time some major league teams and almost all minor league baseball clubs used recreations of their road games as an economy measure.\n\nFounded in 1948, the network was mainly in Texas and the southwest but did have 9 affiliates in Oregon, an outlet in Los Angeles, Seattle, and as of Sept. 29, 1950, WHAV in Haverhill, Massachusetts. At one time, it had about 500 radio stations on the line, being second in size only to the Mutual Broadcasting System.\n\nIt carried various types of programs (for instance, late night band remotes were another feature carried by Liberty) but McLendon, known as the \"Old Scotchman\", and his daily ball game recreations off the Western Union ticker provided the big money maker. The recreations used himself and future sportscasting stars such as Lindsey Nelson and Jerry Doggett.\n\nIt was a live, not recreated, game that provided McLendon and Liberty with their greatest career moment. The Scotchman himself was behind the Liberty mic at the Polo Grounds in New York for the October 3, 1951 finale of the three-game National League play-off series between the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers).\n\nRadio was still the more popular nationwide medium then. With Russ Hodges' famous radio call limited to the Giants' network, McLendon's call is how most Americans heard the NL clincher, including Giant Bobby Thomson's ninth-inning three-run homer into the left-field stands to win it for New York. Excerpts of the McLendon broadcast were highlighted in the 2001 HBO documentary \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\".\n\nAccording to \"Time\" magazine articles of the era, McLendon only paid Major League Baseball $1,000.00 per year for the rights to broadcast the games, but in 1951, the leagues raised the price to $250,000.00 per year, and prohibited broadcasts in any city which had a minor league franchise and in the northeastern and midwestern United States.\n\n\nSports were the lifeblood of the Liberty Broadcasting System. Restrictions on Major League Baseball broadcasts in minor league franchise areas, as well as bans on National Football League broadcasts within a 75-mile range of league cities, were the one-two blow which ended the network. Since the baseball games were a major draw for both listeners and affiliates, the blackout was a disaster for the fledgling company, which had only posted modest profits during its first few years of operation. More than 100 stations left the network, and, faced with mounting debts, on May 16, 1952, the network ceased broadcasting.\n\nLiberty also broadcast NBA games from roughly, the 1950-51 through 1951-52 seasons.\n\n\nIn the mid-2000s, a Spokane, Washington-based broadcaster, the Mutual Broadcasting System (not related to the former network), began using the Mutual and Liberty names on its two stations, KTRW AM 970 Spokane; and KTAC FM 93.9 Ephrata, Washington. These stations have no connections with the original network, but present adult standards, nostalgia, and some Christian programming, using these names as part of the nostalgia-style branding.\n\n"}

Released as the record's lead single in the United States on September 21, 1995, it was written by Gwen Stefani and Tom Dumont, and produced by Matthew Wilder. It has also made an appearance on their 2003 greatest hits album, \"The Singles 1992–2003\". Lyrically, \"Just a Girl\" is a new wave song written about Stefani's perspective of life as a woman and her struggles with having strict parents. \"Just a Girl\" was the first song Stefani wrote without the assistance of her brother Eric.\n\n\"Just a Girl\" received positive reviews from music critics, who commended the feminist lyrics and Stefani's vocals. The single is typically regarded as being the breakthrough that popularized No Doubt. \"Just a Girl\" became No Doubt's first charting single in the United States, peaking at number 23 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and entering the Alternative Songs, Hot Rock Songs, and Mainstream Top 40 component charts. It also reached the top ten in several other countries, including Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Mark Kohr and features Stefani singing in a clean and organized restroom while the male members play their instruments in a dirty and unkept one. Separated by a wall, the men eventually climb over into the ladies' restroom and begin dancing. Stefani's attire in the music video for \"Just a Girl\" was a popular talking point for critics. No Doubt, and Stefani individually, has performed the song in a number of live appearances, including at the group's first concert series Tragic Kingdom World Tour (1995–1997), during the middle portion of the 2002 Rock Steady Tour, and as part of the encore during the 2016 This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour. Stefani named her 2018–2020 concert residency in Las Vegas after the single. It has also been covered and sampled in other works by several musicians.\n\nIn 1992, No Doubt released their eponymous debut album with Interscope Records, which was commercially unsuccessful and caused their record label to cancel funding for further albums and projects. In response, the band independently recorded \"The Beacon Street Collection\" (1995). Impressed by the album, Interscope agreed to resume funding for a third album, which became \"Tragic Kingdom\" (1995). \"Just a Girl\" was written by Gwen Stefani and Tom Dumont, with production handled by Matthew Wilder. Unlike previous songs written by the band, \"Just a Girl\" was not co-written by Gwen's brother Eric Stefani, who left No Doubt due to creative differences in early 1995. In response to reviewers criticizing No Doubt for changing their sound and selling out during this time, Dumont said:\n\nWell, there is a reason that the sound of our music has changed and it's not because we've sold out, easy for me to say. Eric [...] used to write most of our songs. [This] was Gwen's first time really writing all the lyrics herself so to me, it went the opposite from selling out. We have done something that is even more personal. In the past, Eric was writing songs about his life and having Gwen sing them. Now we have Gwen singing and writing about her own experiences. It makes it more natural. She's a singer, she should sing about herself or sing what she wants to sing. I think that is the main reason why our musical style has changed.\nThe first song written for \"Tragic Kingdom\", \"Just a Girl\" was penned by Stefani after her father reprimanded her for driving from her bandmate Tony Kanal's house late at night. Commenting on her first experience with writing a song by herself, she explained: \"I just wanted to write a song to express how I was feeling in that moment and I never in my wildest dreams thought that anyone would hear it. I remember coming up with every single line [and] I have a really bad memory but I really, really remember that moment and feeling I could really relate to myself and this song … I felt like it really echoed exactly how I felt.\" \"Just a Girl\" was the first song mixed with newcomer David J. Holman, founder of Trauma Records. Following this, Holman co-signed No Doubt to his label and began working on more songs to be featured on \"Tragic Kingdom\".\n\nThe song was first released in the United States on September 21, 1995. It was distributed on 7\" records, cassettes, and CDs. The B-side pairing for the American release was album track \"Different People\", which was written by Eric Stefani, Gwen Stefani, and Tony Kanal. A two-part CD single series released in the United Kingdom includes \"The Beacon Street Collection\" track \"Open the Gate\", \"Tragic Kingdom\" tracks \"Different People\", \"End It on This\" and \"Hey You\", and a cover of the Beatles' song \"Ob-La-Di-Ob-La-Da\" (1968). On March 24, 1997, \"Just a Girl\" was re-released in Europe as a CD maxi single and features the album and live versions of \"Just a Girl\", in addition to live versions of \"Don't Speak\" and \"Hey You\". An enhanced CD released in the United States includes the official music video to \"Just a Girl\".\n\nMusically, \"Just a Girl\" is a new wave song with sarcastic lyrics. It was described by Stephen Thomas Erlewine as a \"pseudo-new wave\" track. In addition, the song takes influence from pop and ska music, implying a \"spacey\" sound to the listener. Susan Christian Goulding from \"Orange Coast\" compared Stefani's vocals to both Cyndi Lauper and cartoon character Minnie Mouse; she also described \"Just a Girl\" as the \"flip-side\" of Lauper's 1983 single \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\". Stefani sings in a \"smoky alto\" vocal range with dramatic \"pouts and simpering\" in order to exemplify her irritation with sexism in the music industry. The title of the song itself serves as a \"sarcastic rebuke to the helpless-female cliche\". Josh Tyrangiel from \"Time\" felt Stefani sang with a \"hyperactive ball of energy\" in \"Just a Girl\".\n\nAccording to Musicnotes.com, \"Just a Girl\" is set in common time and has a fast tempo of 184 beats per minute. The key of the song is in D major, with Stefani's vocal range spanning nearly an octave and a half, from B to E in scientific pitch notation. The song progresses in the chord progressions of Bm–A–D–A in the verses and Bm–A–G–A in the chorus. According to the liner notes for No Doubt's 2003 greatest hits album, \"The Singles 1992–2003\", the opening riff that Dumont uses for \"Just a Girl\" was taken from an earlier demo created by Eric Stefani.\n\nLyrically, the song is written from the perspective of a girl who is frustrated with her parents. Inspiration for the songwriting came to Stefani when driving home from Kanal's house: \"I can remember thinking, 'Wow, I'm in the car right now, I'm driving home, it's like one in the morning and if something did happen to me, I'm vulnerable because I'm a girl.' And you start to think, 'Wow, maybe people actually look at me different because I am a female'.\" Other themes of \"Just a Girl\" display Stefani's exasperation over stereotypical female portrayals; Stefani sings: \"Don't you think I know exactly where I stand? / This world is forcing me to hold your hand\". She gathered examples from her sister and female friends of how being \"just a girl\" is patronizing. Through \"sustained sarcasm\", she sings: \"I'm just a girl in the world / That's all that you'll let me be / I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite / So don't let me have any rights\".\n\nCritiques of \"Just a Girl\" during its release era were positive. Mike Boehm wrote in the \"Los Angeles Times\" that Stefani's lyrics of \"irony and indirection\" make the serious subject matter of \"Just a Girl\" more appealing to the listener. In addition to several other tracks from \"Tragic Kingdom\", Nick Levine from Noisey praised \"Just a Girl\" for having a chorus \"that will bounce round your brain for days\".\n\nContemporary critics described \"Just a Girl\" as No Doubt's breakthrough single. It was also considered a major contribution to the success of \"Tragic Kingdom\". Kenneth Partridge from \"Billboard\" recognized \"Just a Girl\" as the song that made No Doubt popular and secured Stefani's role in the music industry as the opposite of \"some delicate flower who needs protecting or tolerates special treatment\". Mic's Tom Barnes found that \"Just a Girl\" helped popularize the ska genre and called it part of a \"potentially serious music movement\". Ilana Kaplan from \"Observer\" wrote that \"it was 'Just a Girl' that really set things into motion for No Doubt\"; she continued:\n\nThe song was featured in '90s cult hits \"Clueless\" and \"Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion\"—movies that served as power-players for unlikely female heroes. Stefani's aim at a male-centric world ended up being one of the most prominent feminist anthems of the '90s—it's a song that stands out now as the music industry's misogynistic outlook continues on.Stefani's sarcasm for a lack of equality made \"Just a Girl\" one of the catchiest feminist anthems of the '90s.\n\nIn honor of the 20th anniversary of \"Tragic Kingdom\", a group of critics from \"The A.V. Club\" reanalyzed the album. Marah Eakin noted that \"Just a Girl\" was able to \"age [...] surprisingly well\". Although Alex McCown disliked Stefani's pouty vocals on the track, Annie Zaleski thought her \"exaggerated pouts and simpering\" were intentional and dealt with the song's subject matter.\n\n\"Just a Girl\" was commercially successful, becoming No Doubt's first entry on a record chart in the United States and reaching the top ten in several countries. In the United States, \"Just a Girl\" debuted at number 84 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on the issue dated December 16, 1995 as that week's fourth-highest debut. On the issue dated May 4, 1996, the song reached a peak of number 23 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, during its 21st consecutive week on the chart. It spent a total of 29 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and served as No Doubt's highest-charting effort until 2002's \"Hey Baby\" peaked at number five. \"Just a Girl\" was ranked number 68 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100's 1996 year-end list. The single also received heavy airplay rotation on alternative and mainstream pop radio stations. On \"Billboard\"s Alternative Songs chart, \"Just a Girl\" peaked at number ten, becoming their first of five entries within the top ten. It also reached number 24 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart.\n\n\"Just a Girl\" did not enter the \"RPM\" singles chart in Canada, but reached the Top Rock/Alternative Tracks chart, where it debuted at number 28 and reached a peak of number 25 the following week. In Australia, the song peaked at number three on the ARIA Singles Chart, becoming No Doubt's first of six top ten entries. It was present within the top ten of the chart for 11 consecutive weeks. On the 1996 year-end chart in Australia, \"Just a Girl\" was ranked as the 22nd most-successful song of the year. The single also received a Platinum certification that same year for physical single shipments of 70,000 copies. In New Zealand, \"Just a Girl\" peaked at number nine and was 1996's 25th best-selling single.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Just a Girl\" debuted at number 38 on the issue dated October 26, 1996. It dropped to number 61 the following week and departed from the chart the week afterwards. \"Just a Girl\" gave No Doubt their first top 40 entry in the United Kingdom. Following a wave of CD singles for the re-release of \"Just a Girl\" in 1997, the single entered the singles chart as a separate, new entry at number three on the issue dated July 5, 1997. It became No Doubt's second top ten single, following \"Don't Speak\" which topped the charts in the February of the same year. According to the Official Charts Company, \"Just a Girl\" was No Doubt's second-best selling single with 150,000 copies sold since \"Don't Speak\" sold 830,000 copies in 1997. As of March 2016, the single has sold 222,000 copies in the United Kingdom, remaining No Doubt's second-biggest and Gwen Stefani's fifth-biggest selling single combined. The song entered \"Billboard\"s European Hot 100 Singles chart, where it reached a peak at number 77 in November 1996. \"Just a Girl\" also reached the top ten in Ireland and Norway.\n\nAn accompanying music video for \"Just a Girl\" was produced and acts as No Doubt's second video overall. Unlike the video for 1992's \"Trapped in a Box\" which was funded completely at the expense of No Doubt, the video for \"Just a Girl\" received funding from Interscope Records and was directed by Mark Kohr. However, the project remained low in budget in comparison to other music videos from the time. The opening scene to \"Just a Girl\" was filmed in the driveway of Stefani's grandparents' house. Like in the lyrics of \"Just a Girl\", the music video features female stereotypes and serves as a \"commentary on society\". Dumont and Kanal both stated that it represents equality between the sexes.\n\nThe video opens with No Doubt loading instruments into the trunk of a car. Stefani stands in front of a nearby wrecked sedan and starts singing \"Just a Girl\", shortly before sitting in the backseat of the other car with Dumont and Kanal. The group travels to Los Angeles and arrives at two public restrooms – one for males and one for females. Stefani enters the latter one carrying a boombox while the men enter the former carrying various musical equipment. The ladies' room is clean, brightly decorated and well-furnished with flowers, fruit and two female assistants; the men's room is dark, dirty and bare-walled. The male band members set up and play their instruments in their restroom while Stefani sings in the ladies' restroom. Various men and women enter their respective bathrooms; the men use the urinals and the women check their make-up, before dancing with the band. Eventually, the men take to lifting each other through the ceiling tiles in order to get into the other bathroom. The video ends showing everyone dancing together in the same restroom.\n\nStefani's choice of clothing and makeup in the video was discussed by critics, who pointed out her choices to display her midriff and wear a bindi on her forehead. MTV's Gil Kaufman wrote \"from her platinum blonde hair, forehead bindi, ruby red lips and crop tops to the push-ups she bangs out at the end, the video was the world's first glimpse at what would become Stefani's iconic look and stage persona\". The video was largely successful and was frequently shown on various music-related television networks, including MTV. In 2004, the video was featured on No Doubt's compilation \"The Videos 1992–2003\".\n\nIn 1995, No Doubt played the first-ever Warped Tour and performed \"Just a Girl\" to begin the promotion of \"Tragic Kingdom\". They opened a concert at the Virgin Megastore in Los Angeles with the song in October 1995. Immediately before this performance of \"Just a Girl\", Stefani promised her mother that she would not curse while singing; however, Stefani did and as a consequence, her mother refused to speak to her for a week. In January 1996, No Doubt performed \"Just a Girl\" on the American TV show \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", marking their first appearance on late night television. Later that year on March 28, they sang \"Just a Girl\" on \"Late Show with David Letterman\". After the performance, the band was delighted to learn that David Letterman had been seen \"tapping his foot\" against the ground as they performed.\n\n\"Just a Girl\" was performed as the seventh song during their 1995–97 Tragic Kingdom World Tour. According to \"Rolling Stone\"s Chris Heath, the \"greatest moment\" on the concert appears during this performance: during the refrain of the song, Stefani asked the men in the crowd to sing along; after they sing \"I'm just a girl\" to her amusement, she then asks for the females in the audience to join her. Stefani questions: \"What about all the sweet, cute, little girls? Sweet, little, tiny, sweet girls. You want to sing?\" before screaming \"Fuck you, I'm a girl!\". The performance of the song at the July 1, 1997 show in Anaheim, at The Arrowhead Pond, was recorded and released in No Doubt's first live album, \"Live in the Tragic Kingdom\" (1997). For the 2002 Rock Steady Tour, \"Just a Girl\" was performed during the concert's middle segment, following singing \"Simple Kind of Life\" and preceding \"Hey Baby\". Stefani engaged the audience with questions like \"Wanna know something?\" and then answered in the form of a song lyric: \"I'm just a girl because that's all that you'll let me be!\" \"The New York Times\"s Kelefa Sanneh found this as Stefani either \"addressing her fans [and] joking about the demands of stardom\" or \"addressing a lover [and] lodging a bitter complaint about a relationship gone awry\". The performance of \"Just a Girl\" at the November 22–23 and 29, 2002 shows in Long Beach at the Long Beach Convention and Entertainment Center was recorded and featured on the group's second live album, \"Rock Steady Live\" (2003).\n\nThe song was performed as the opening song of No Doubt and Blink-182's Summer Tour 2004. The tour occurred specifically at amphitheaters around the United States. Prior to the performance of \"Just a Girl\", Queen's \"We Will Rock You\" was played over the PA system to welcome No Doubt. Stefani then joined the crowd from the stage wearing oversized green, plaid pants and a brown sweatshirt that emphasized her midriff. During the second iHeartRadio Music Festival in 2012, American singer Pink joined No Doubt on stage for a duetted version of \"Just a Girl\". The staff at \"Entertainment Tonight\" was impressed by the performance, calling it a \"rad moment\".\n\nFor Stefani's solo This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour of 2016, \"Just a Girl\" was performed as part of the concert's encore, alongside performances of \"Truth\" (2016) and \"The Sweet Escape\" (2006). Stefani changed outfits, prior to returning to the stage, and wore a white corset that displaying the words \"Blond Rebel\" for the performance. In April 2018, Stefani announced a concert residency titled Just a Girl that would occur at the Planet Hollywood Resort Las Vegas. During the show, the singer performs a number including \"Just a Girl\" during the concert's encore. Stefani wears a \"sparkly cowgirl getup\" which serves as a nod to her boyfriend Blake Shelton.\n\nAmerican country duo Bomshel included a cover of \"Just a Girl\" on their 2009 debut album \"Fight like a Girl\". JC Chasez's girl band Girl Radical recorded a cover of \"Just a Girl\" in 2013, which served as their official debut single. They filmed a corresponding music video for the song which was released on August 15, 2013. On a 2017 episode of \"MTV Unplugged\", Japanese singer-songwriter Kaela Kimura covered \"Just a Girl\" live as the seventh song of her 14-track set list.\n\nIn 2018, Pink sampled \"Just a Girl\" and Nirvana's 1991 single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" during performances of her singles \"Just like a Pill\" (2002) and \"Who Knew\" (2006) for her 2018–19 Beautiful Trauma World Tour. During Pink's appearance in Los Angeles at the Staples Center, Stefani joined the singer for a surprise duet to the fans. \"Just a Girl\" has also been included on the scores to \"Clueless\" (1995) and \"Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion\" (1997). The song also appears in the film \"Captain Marvel\" (2019).\n\nAustralia/UK CD single\n\nEurope CD maxi-single\n\nEurope CD single\n\nFrance CD single\n\nNetherlands CD single\n\nUK 7\" jukebox single\n\nUK cassette single\nUK CD single (Part 1)\n\nUK CD single (Part 2)\n\nUS cassette single\n\nUS enhanced CD single\n\nUS promotional cassette single\n\nUS promotional CD single\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Tragic Kingdom\".\n\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom (BPI)\n\n"}

He started ice hockey with the Oyster Bay Gulls and was part of a team that won NY State Championships in 1978, 1980, and 1982, Pee Wee National Championships in 1980, and Jr B National Championship in 1985. Weisbrod was drafted by the Minnesota North Stars round 4, #73 overall in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft and then was acquired and signed by San Jose in 1991. Because of injury, Weisbrod took the year off hockey in 1991–1992, only to play 16 games with the Kansas City Blades of the IHL before being forced to retire, also due to injury. Weisbrod retired as a player in 1993 following surgery for significant damage to his shoulder.\n\nWeisbrod was General Manager and Director of Operations for the Albany River Rats, winning the Calder Cup in 1993 and 1995. Weisbrod was then named President and Chief Operating Officer of RDV Sports (Orlando Magic & Solar Bears) in 2000. He also served as General Manager of the IHL’s Orlando Solar Bears where he guided the team to a Turner Cup Championship in 2001. Weisbrod was promoted to General Manager of the Orlando Magic of the National Basketball Association in 2004. He remained in that position until 2005.\n\nWhen the IHL disbanded, the Solar Bears owner promoted him into the Magic organization in an administrative position. However, he was soon promoted to General Manager of the Magic after the team fired John Gabriel following a disappointing 21–61 season in 2003–2004.\n\nHe helped influence the firing of Doc Rivers, and appointed Johnny Davis head coach of the Magic. However, with 18 games left in the 2004–2005 season, Weisbrod also fired Davis and named assistant coach Chris Jent the interim head coach.\n\nWeisbrod was also responsible for the blockbuster trade of disgruntled superstar Tracy McGrady. In a 7-player deal which sent McGrady, Juwan Howard, Tyronn Lue, and Reece Gaines to the Houston Rockets, the Magic received erratic point guard Steve Francis, Cuttino Mobley, and Kelvin Cato. Weisbrod received written death threats from fans on different occasions following this transaction. That megatrade was only the beginning of the dismantling of the 2003–2004 team; Weisbrod only retained three of the players for the 2004–2005 season.\n\nWeisbrod also acquired swingman Hedo Türkoğlu, center Tony Battie (traded from Cleveland for Drew Gooden, defensive player Doug Christie (traded from the Sacramento Kings for Mobley), and drafted Dwight Howard with the number one pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. In addition, Weisbrod also acquired Jameer Nelson in that draft, trading a future first round pick to the Denver Nuggets in return for Nelson, who was the 20th pick.\n\nOn May 23, 2005, Weisbrod resigned from his position of General Manager and Chief Operating Officer of the Orlando Magic, citing an opportunity to return to an executive position in the National Hockey League.\n\nOn July 14, 2005, the Dallas Stars of the NHL announced that Weisbrod had joined the team as a scout for the New England region.\n\nAfter a season with the Stars, Weisbrod joined the scouting staff of the Boston Bruins on September 14, 2006 as a pro scout based out of Tampa, Florida. After two seasons scouting the professional leagues, Weisbrod became the Bruins' Director of Collegiate Scouting.\n\nOn June 27, 2011, Weisbrod was named the Assistant General Manager of Player Personnel of the Calgary Flames after winning a Stanley Cup ring with the Bruins. On December 12, 2013, he was relieved of his duties.\n\nOn July 7, 2014, Weisbrod was named vice president of player personnel for the Canucks. On August 4, 2015, he was promoted to assistant general manager. As Assistant General Manager, he works closely with Jim Benning on player personnel decisions, providing strategic direction to the professional and amateur scouting departments and supporting day-to-day team operations.\n"}

It has been incorporated in chemical weapons since the early months of World War I. Some commentators say the first use was in August 1914, when the French attacked German soldiers with tear gas grenades, but the agent used in that incident was more likely to be ethyl bromoacetate, which the French had tested before the war. \n\nThe first extensive use of xylyl bromide was the firing by German forces of 18,000 \"T-shells\" at Russian positions in the Battle of Bolimów in January 1915. The shells were modified 15 cm (6 inch) artillery shells containing an explosive charge and c. 3 kg (7 lb) xylyl bromide. The attack was a complete failure because the winter weather was too cold to permit an effective aerosol, and the agent was either blown back towards the German lines, fell harmlessly to the ground, or was insufficiently concentrated to cause damage. A similar attack at Nieuwpoort in March 1915 was also unsuccessful. Nevertheless, because of its ease of manufacture xylyl bromide was widely used in World War I, in particular as a component of the Germans' Weisskreuz (white cross) mixture.\n\nThree isomers, collectively referred to by CAS registry number , are:\n\n\nIn the absence of clarification, the name \"xylyl bromide\" may refer to any one of these isomers or a mixture of all three.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1890088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890088", "title": "Frederick Foswell", "text": "Frederick Foswell\n\nFrederick Foswell, also known as the Big Man and Patch, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nFrederick Foswell first appeared, as the Big Man, in \"The Amazing Spider-Man #10\" (March 1964), and was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.\n\nThe character subsequently appeared in \"The Amazing Spider-Man Annual\" #1 (1964), \"Amazing Spider-Man\" #23-27 (April–August 1965), #29-34 (October 1965-March 1966), #37 (June 1966), \"Amazing Spider-Man Annual\" #3 (1966), \"Amazing Spider-Man\" #42-47 (November 1966-April 1967), #49-52 (June–September 1967). The Big Man also made appearances in \"Marvel Team-Up\" #40 (December 1975) and \"Marvels\" #2 (February 1994). The character died in \"Amazing Spider-Man\" #52 (September 1967).\n\nThe Big Man received an entry in the \"Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition\" #16, and in \"The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man\" #1 (2005).\n\nFrederick Foswell was born in Queens, New York. He worked as a reporter at the Daily Bugle for evidently quite a number of years, though the sliding timescale puts some of the hints of this into question: in the Night Raven story in \"Marvel Super-Heroes\" (UK) #394 (February 1983), Foswell is referred to as a friend of Scoop Daly and as having attended Scoop Daly's funeral. A man named Fredrick was shown working for the Bugle in \"Sgt. Fury\" #110.\n\nFoswell begins leading a double life as the Big Man, head of New York's crime and the boss of the notorious Enforcers. Frail and diminutive in stature, Foswell conceals his identity by wearing a mask, oversized coat, and giant platform boots whenever he appears as the Big Man. Although he has a considerable run of success as a crime boss, a confrontation with Spider-Man ends with his Enforcers being apprehended, and shortly afterwards the police deduce his identity and arrest him.\n\nAfter Foswell serves his sentence, his Daily Bugle boss J. Jonah Jameson rehires him, an act of trust which immediately earns Foswell's gratitude. When another masked crime lord called the Crime Master arises, working in collusion with the Green Goblin, Foswell again begins wearing a mask - an eyepatched face that he uses as the alter ego Patch. Acting as a stool-pigeon, he tips off the police to planned crimes while getting scoops.\n\nHoping to learn how his co-worker Peter Parker (Spider-Man's alter ego) always gets great photos of Spider-Man, Foswell follows him, and witnesses a (faked) conversation between Parker and Spider-Man indicating they've been conspiring to ensure that Parker is always present when Spider-Man goes into action. Parker and Foswell occasionally work together, with Peter tipping off Foswell as Spider-Man before a major bust and then taking pictures to go with Foswell's stories.\n\nFollowing a crime war, the Kingpin takes over New York's underworld. Foswell, his ego smarting at seeing another man in his place, tries to reinstate himself as the Big Man, but the Kingpin outwits him, instead forcibly enlisting him as a lieutenant. When Kingpin kidnaps Jameson because of his editorials on the new crime wave, Spider-Man tries to rescue him, but is beaten by Kingpin. Kingpin tries to drown both Jameson and Spider-Man, but Spider-Man uses his webbing to create an air bubble that keeps them both alive. The attempted murder of Jameson turns Foswell against Kingpin, who, sensing this, tries to kill him. However, Spider-Man enters and stops him. While Kingpin and Spider-Man battle, Foswell runs into the basement of the Kingpin's building to try to help Jameson. When he finds Jameson, Foswell protects him from the thugs trying to kill him, and takes a bullet meant for him. The Kingpin escapes, and Foswell dies from the bullet wound. Jameson memorializes him as a hero in the \"Daily Bugle\".\n\nFrederick Foswell was revealed to have a daughter named Janice. Adopting the Big Man mantle, Janice teams up with a new Crime Master, the Sandman, and the Enforcers to seek revenge on Spider-Man, battling him, the Human Torch and the Sons of the Tiger. However, when Janice and Crime Master get into an argument about who is in charge, Janice is shot by her erstwhile partner, who is subsequently revealed to be Nick Lewis Jr., the son of the original Crime Master and - ironically - her fiancé. Many years later, his younger prodigy - Frederick Jr. - would also attempt to avenge his father and sister's death on Spider-Man, only to be defeated by him and Jameson, who felt remorse for his own role in leading Frederick Jr. to his revenge road.\n\nDuring the \"\" storyline, Frederick Foswell's Big Man alias is cloned by Miles Warren's company New U Technologies.\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel version of Frederick Foswell's name is seen on a \"Daily Bugle\" byline in a published story on Spider-Man's death.\n\n\nA viral marketing for \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" shows a Daily Bugle article mentioning the growing rumors of a ‘Big Man’ who is trying to consolidate organized crime in Manhattan. The article is written by Foswell, himself. In a later article, Foswell revealed that 'The Big Man' is in a gang war with the Russian mob, which Aleksei Sytsevich is notably a part of. In yet another article, this time posted by Ned Leeds, Foswell's identity is reported to now be exposed and that Foswell has been arrested for his crimes as 'The Big Man'.

For seven years he attended the Victorian Artists' Society evening life drawing class three nights a week.\n\nTucker's main inspirations include post-impressionists, expressionists and social realists, as well as personal experience. Tucker's work was strongly influenced by the realistic reflections of two important émigré artists, Josl Bergner and Danila Vassilieff, who arrived in Melbourne in the late 1930s about the same time that Tucker began to explore images of the Great Depression. Tucker also met Sunday and John Reed, members of the Contemporary Art Society, which was set up in 1938 by George Bell, in opposition to the government Australian Academy of Art, which was believed to promote conservative art and not the modernists.\n\nTucker's first significant works were produced during his involvement in the army. In 1940, Tucker was called up for army service and spent most of his time working in Heidelberg Military Hospital drawing patients suffering from wounds and mental illnesses as a result of war. He produced three important works at this stage, \"Man at Table\", a pen and ink illustration of a man whose nose had been sliced off by a shell fragment, \"The Waste Land\", an image of death sitting on a stool watching and waiting, and \"Floating Figures\", of two figures floating down a hall, a third with a demented smile. All of these images illustrated the horror and madness of war, but in a style reflecting his social realists surrealistic and expressionistic style.\n\nIn 1942, Tucker was discharged from the war and returned to Melbourne. An impression of Australian soldiers, clutching young women was the catalyst for his series of works known as the \"Images of Modern Evil\", Victory Girls, depicting Melbourne nightlife. Tucker also took to photography, both of his own paintings, and to record the ideas and scenes he used to compose them, and inadvertently created a document of his time.\n\nTucker associated with John and Sunday Reed, who saw connections between Tucker's work and other artists, angry at the social situation. This so-called \"Angry Decade\" of the 1940s, saw artists Tucker become associated with the Angry Penguins, a group of modernist artists including Joy Hester, Sidney Nolan, John Perceval, Arthur Boyd and Noel Counihan. The Reeds' property at Heide was a major outlet for the expression of avant-garde ideas. The modernists and social realists shared the same concerns. These artists wrote for the publication \"Angry Penguins\", published by Max Harris. Tucker's original influences, Bergner and Vassilieff, were part of this group.\n\nIn early 1947, Tucker traveled to Japan with the Australian army as an art correspondent. He produced a monochrome pen drawing called \"Hiroshima\"; it contains no figures, just the aftermath of the atomic bomb blast, with tents and shelters littering the landscape. In 1954 he met Sidney Nolan in Rome, when he produced \"Apocalyptic Horse\" and began painting Australia from memory. He was exhibited in the Venice Biennale in 1956 and then spent two years in London painting the Thames Series.\n\nHe then moved to New York in 1958 and his subjects switched from the city to outback Australia. Where some works of Sidney Nolan and Russell Drysdale had reached international level, Tucker rejected them as being nationalistic. He depicted the landscape as being a harsh, barren and sterile wasteland. He distorted stereotypes and icons of the Australian bush, including convicts, Burke and Wills and the Kelly Gang. He was influenced by the sheer barrenness and hopelessness that the outback conveyed, and added these icons as pawns to the outback's deadly game.\n\nIn 1959, Tucker won the Australian Women's Weekly Prize, which enabled him to spend two years in New York producing the Manhattan Series and Antipodean Heads.\nIn 1960 he was awarded the Kurt Geiger Award by MOMA Australia which he used to return to Australia and mount his first Australian solo exhibition. He subsequently settled in Victoria and in 1964 he married his second wife Barbara Bilcock.\n\nIn 1990 the National Gallery of Australia held a retrospective of his work.\n\nIn 1941, Tucker married fellow artist Joy Hester, and they had a son, Sweeney. It emerged many years later that Tucker was not the boy's biological father—it was probably Australian jazz drummer Billy Hyde, with whom Hester had had a brief affair. His marriage broke down in 1947 and Tucker travelled to Japan and Europe, leading a bohemian life, painting, exhibiting and taking odd jobs. When Hester was later diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, she gave Sweeney into the care of the Reeds, who adopted him. Joy Hester died in 1960, and Sweeney committed suicide in 1979.\n\nIn his later years in the 1980s, and especially after the deaths of John and Sunday Reed, Tucker took on the task of recording the history of the artists circle he had known:\n\nThe result was the series of portraits known as \"Faces I Have Met\". \n\nTucker's work is represented in all of the Australian State galleries as well as the National Gallery of Australia, the Guggenheim Museum and MOMA in New York.\n\nTucker married Barbara Bilcock in 1963. It was the second marriage for both. Tucker died in 1999. Barbara Tucker controls the Tucker estate.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a market town in the valley of the Derry River, a tributary of the River Slaney.\n\nIt is located on the R747 road which links the west Wicklow town of Baltinglass with Arklow on the east coast. The village is situated near the southern point of the Wicklow Way which winds through the Wicklow Mountains. The River Derry runs through the village. In the census of 2011, the population was recorded at 970, with 1537 people in the Tinahely electoral division as a whole.\n\nThe town of Tinahely is part of the civil parish of Kilcommon in the ancient barony of Ballinacor South. Most of the village dates from the early part of the 19th century as it was rebuilt by Lord Fitzwilliam after it was burnt during the 1798 rebellion. The Fiztwilliam family lived in nearby Coolattin House. The Coollattin estate once comprised , had 20,000 tenants and occupied almost a quarter of County Wicklow.\n\nTinahely's parish church, St. Kevin's church, lies 2 km to the east of the village in the townland of Kilaveny overlooking the valley of the Derry stream. The church was erected in 1843 when it replaced another structure located in the adjacent townland of Whitefield which had been burned down on November 11, 1798 by Yeomen soldiers in reprisal for local activity during the 1798 Rebellion. The Whitefield church was replaced by a temporary wooden structure until the erection of St. Kevin's church. The original structure had been erected during the Penal Laws in 1700 and was cruciform in style with two transepts and a nave. Nothing now remains of the original church except for the cemetery that was attached to it. No burials have taken place in the cemetery since the mid 1900s. In the Jubilee Year 2000, parishioners erected a carved commemorative limestone marker on the site of the original church, in the present Whitefield Cemetery, setting out the above history.\n\nThe Courthouse Arts Centre, Dwyer Square, formerly the civil courthouse building hosts musical performances, artist exhibitions, plays and film screenings. The building was restored by a committee of local people with help from FÁS. The local public library, also in Dwyer Square, was formerly the town's market house. There is also a community center located on grounds of original national school on School Road.\n\nChurches in the area include St. Kevin's Church, Kilavaney (Roman Catholic), St. Peter & St. Paul Church, Crossbridge (a Roman Catholic sub-parish of Kilaveney), and Kilcommon Church, Parish of Crosspatrick and Carnew Group (Church of Ireland).\n\nThere is a walking route along the line of a former railway which leads from Tinahely to Tomnafinnoge Oak Wood in the nearby town of Shillelagh. Three circular waymarked trails were also opened in 2010, and Tinahely is close to the Wicklow Way, one of Ireland's most popular long-distance trails.\n\nThe Tinahely Agricultural Show takes place annually on the first Monday of August (a bank holiday in the Republic of Ireland). This one-day show is held at Fairwood Park and has been running for over 70 years.\n\nTinahely GAA club was established in 1886. The club plays in St Kevin's Park which opened in May 1978. The club colours are red and white. In 1984 the club became the first club from Wicklow to reach the final of the Leinster Senior Club Football Championship but was beaten by St Vincents GAA.\n\nThe local Triathlon club run a Duathlon every year on the Sunday of the May Bank Holiday.\n\nTinahely railway station opened on 22 May 1865, closed for passenger and goods traffic on 24 April 1944 and finally closed altogether on 20 April 1945.\n\nThe Wicklow Way bus service serves Tinahely on a daily basis (must be booked in advance) and links with Dublin trains at Rathdrum railway station. Bus Éireann route 132 (Rosslare Europort - Dublin serves Tinahely on Thursdays once in each direction linking to Baltinglass, Tallaght, Carnew and Wexford.\n\n\n\n"}

The \"Reporter\" became a daily newspaper in 1905, and merged with the \"Orlando Evening Star\" in 1906. Another Orlando paper, the \"South Florida Sentinel\", started publishing as a morning daily in 1913. Then known as the \"Morning Sentinel\", it bought the \"Reporter-Star\" in 1931, when Martin Andersen came to Orlando to manage both papers. Andersen eventually bought both papers outright in 1945, selling them to the Tribune Company of Chicago in 1965.\n\nIn 1973, the two publications merged into the daily Sentinel Star.

During the course of her career, she wrote over 325 scripts. She was the first writer to win two Academy Awards. Marion began her film career working for filmmaker Lois Weber. She wrote numerous silent film scenarios for actress Mary Pickford, before transitioning to writing sound films.\n\nMarion was born Marion Benson Owens in San Francisco, California, to Len D. Owens and Minnie Benson. She had an older sister, Maude, and a younger brother, Len. Her parents divorced when she was 10, and she lived with her mother. She dropped out of school at age 12, after having been caught drawing a cartoon strip of her teacher. She then transferred to a school in San Mateo and then to the Mark Hopkins Art Institute in San Francisco when she was 16 years old. Marion attended this school from 1904 until the school was destroyed by the fire that followed in the wake of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.\n\nWhile in San Francisco, Marion worked as a photographer's assistant to Arnold Genthe and experimented with photographic layouts and color film. Later she worked for Western Pacific Railroads as a commercial artist, then as a reporter for the \"San Francisco Examiner\". After moving to Los Angeles, Marion worked as a poster artist for the Morosco Theater as well as an advertising firm doing commercial layouts.\n\nIn the summer of 1914 she was hired as a writing assistant, an actress and general assistant by Lois Weber Productions, a film company owned and operated by pioneer female film director Lois Weber. She could have been an actor, but preferred work behind the camera.\n\nWhen Lois Weber went to work for Universal, she offered to bring Marion with her. Marion decided not to take Weber up on the offer. Soon after, close friend Mary Pickford offered Marion a job at Famous Players-Lasky. Marion accepted, and began working on scenarios for films like \"Fanchon the Cricket\", \"Little Pal\", and \"Rags.\" Marion was then cast alongside Pickford in \"A Girl of Yesterday\". At the same time, she worked on an original scenario for Pickford to star in, \"The Foundling.\" Marion sold the script to Adolph Zukor for $125. The film was shot in New York, and \"Moving Picture World\" gave it a positive pre-release review. But the film negative was destroyed in a laboratory fire before prints could be made.\n\nMarion, having traveled from Los Angeles to New York for \"The Foundling\"'s premiere, applied for work as a writer at World Films and was hired for an unpaid two-week trial. For her first project, she decided to try recutting existing films that had been shelved as unreleasable. Marion wrote a new prologue and epilogue for a film starring Alice Brady, daughter of World Films boss William Brady. The new portions turned the film from a laughable melodrama into a comedy. The revised film sold for distribution for $9,000, and Brady gave Marion a $200/week contract for her writing services.\nSoon Marion became head of the writing department at World Films, where she was credited with writing 50 films. She left in 1917 when, following the success of \"The Poor Little Rich Girl,\" Famous Players-Lasky signed her to a $50,000 a year contract as Mary Pickford's official scenarioist. Marion was reported at this time to be \"one of the highest paid script writers in the business.\" Her first project under the contract was an adaptation of \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\".\n\nMarion worked as a journalist and served overseas as a combat correspondent during World War I. She documented women's contribution to the war effort on the front lines, and was the first woman to cross the Rhine after the armistice. \n\nUpon Marion's return from Europe in 1919, William Randolph Hearst offered her $2,000 a week to write scenarios for his Cosmopolitan Productions. Marion shared a house with fellow screenwriter Anita Loos on Long Island.\n\nWhile at Cosmopolitan, Marion wrote an adaptation of Fannie Hurst's \"Humoresque\". Her success in adapting the novel and her friendship with Hurst contributed to her decision to adapt another Hurst story, \"Superman,\" for her directorial debut. The resulting film, \"Just Around the Corner\", was a best-seller for the studio. Marion directed one more film, \"The Love Light\", starring Mary Pickford. \n\nShe won the Academy Award for Writing in 1931 for the film \"The Big House\", she received the Academy Award for Best Story for \"The Champ\" in 1932, both featuring Wallace Beery, and co-wrote \"Min and Bill\" starring her friend Marie Dressler and Beery in 1930. She was credited with writing 300 scripts and over 130 produced films.\n\nOn October 23, 1915, Marion participated in a parade of more than thirty thousand supporters of women's suffrage in New York City. \n\nAfter her success in Hollywood, Marion often visited Aetna Springs Resort in Aetna Springs, California, using it as a personal retreat and often bringing several film-industry colleagues with her on vacations. The resort, in fact, was directly connected to her own family's history, for Marion's father had built the resort in the 1870s. Marion was married four times, first to Wesley de Lappe and then to Robert Pike, both prior to changing her name. In 1919, she wed Fred Thomson, who co-starred with Mary Pickford in \"The Love Light\" in 1921. She was such close friends with Mary Pickford that they honeymooned together when Mary married Douglas Fairbanks and Frances married Fred. After Thomson's unexpected death from a leg wound in 1928, she married director George W. Hill in 1930, but that marriage ended in divorce in 1933. She had two sons—Frederick C. Thomson and Richard Thomson (adopted). Frederick earned a PhD in English at Yale, taught there and later joined the faculty of the University of North Carolina. He became an editor of the writings of George Eliot, publishing editions of \"Felix Holt, the Radical\" in 1980 and later.\n\nFor many years she was under contract to MGM Studios. Independently wealthy, she left Hollywood in 1946 to devote more time to writing stage plays and novels.\n\nFrances Marion published a memoir \"Off With Their Heads: A Serio-Comic Tale of Hollywood\" in 1972. Marion died the following year of a ruptured aneurysm in Los Angeles.\n\n\n"}

He is also noted for stints in his boyhood club Trabzonspor, which plays their current games in a stadium named after him. His playing career there saw the club win all 6 of their Süper Lig titles.\n\nGüneş began his amateur career at Erdoğdu Gençlik as a goalkeeper. Shortly after he was recruited for the Trabzonspor development team, and began playing for the senior team soon after. He played for Trabzonspor for twelve years between 1975 and 1987. During this period he won six league championships. In the 1978–79 season he set the Süper Lig clean sheet record by not conceding a single goal for 1,110 minutes. He was part of the \"Trabzonpor Efsanesi\" (literally \"The Legend of Trabzonspor\", a name given by the Turkish press) along with other local players such as Turgay Semercioğlu, Necmi Perekli, and Ali Kemal Denizci.

It is the home of the Belleville Senators of the American Hockey League (AHL). Built in 1978, it was then known as the Quinte Sports Centre and eventually Yardmen Arena. It is part of a larger recreational complex with several ice rinks, a pool and other facilities.\n\nThe arena's name is in honour of a small group of railroaders known as \"The Belleville Yardmen\" who raised more than to contribute to its construction. The arena was built with an international sized ice surface of 200 ft. length by 100 ft. width. It was the largest ice surface in the Ontario Hockey League. This has since been converted to a standard NHL-sized rink. The arena is one of four ice rinks in the Quinte Sports & Wellness Centre complex.\n\nYardmen Arena has two balconies, on opposite sides of the ice. It was the only arena in the Ontario Hockey League to have a second level of seating until Budweiser Gardens was built in London, Ontario in 2002.\n\nThe arena was opened in 1978. The Belleville Bulls started as a Junior Tier II team in the OHA. On February 2, 1981, the OHL granted an expansion franchise to the city of Belleville and the ownership group of Dr. Robert L. Vaughan & Bob Dolan, and the Bulls joined the OHL. The team played in the arena until 2015, when it was sold and moved to Hamilton. The Yardmen Arena has hosted the OHL All-Star Game twice, in 1983 and 2006.\n\nYardmen Arena hosted an NHL pre-season game between the Washington Capitals and Winnipeg Jets on September 14, 2013 as part of the Kraft Hockeyville festivities. Nearby Stirling-Rawdon won the Kraft Hockeyville contest in 2012, but the original game scheduled between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Columbus Blue Jackets was cancelled due to the 2012-13 NHL lockout.\n\nDuring the 2015–16 hockey season, Yardmen Arena hosted three Federal Hockey League games, with the intent of the league exploring the location for a team. If Belleville had been given a franchise, their nearest opponent would have been the Watertown Wolves across the US/Canada border, about 100 miles away in Watertown, New York. The games all had the Berlin River Drivers as the home team against and the Port Huron Prowlers on December 12, the Danbury Titans on January 2, and the Dayton Demolition on February 13.\n\nIn summer 2016, it was reported that the Ottawa Senators were considering moving their American Hockey League affiliate, then known as the Binghamton Senators, to Yardmen Arena for the 2017–18 AHL season. Upgrades would have to be made to accommodate an AHL franchise including repairing the boards, the floor refrigeration system, and increasing the arena's capacity. The transfer was confirmed in September 2016, after Belleville City Council approved a $20.5 million upgrade to the arena. The upgrades included an increase in capacity, a new NHL-sized rink, new home team dressing room, new refrigeration system, new score clock, new washrooms and a new public entrance and in effect lead to a rebuilding of the arena. The Belleville Senators agreed to a lease for eight years. The team played their first month of the 2017–18 AHL season on the road and opened their inaugural season at the Yardmen Arena on November 1, 2017, to a sold out crowd.\n\nOn September 19, 2018, the Senators sold the naming rights of the arena and it became officially known as CAA Arena for the 2018–19 season.

{"id": "1890144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890144", "title": "Beriev Be-200", "text": "Beriev Be-200\n\nThe Beriev Be-200 \"Altair\" () is a multipurpose amphibious aircraft designed and built by the Beriev Aircraft Company. Marketed as being designed for fire fighting, search and rescue, maritime patrol, cargo, and passenger transportation, it has a capacity of 12,000 litres (3,170 US gallons) of water, or up to 72 passengers.\n\nThe name \"Altair\" was chosen after a competition amongst Beriev and Irkut staff in 2002/2003, as a reference to the name of the alpha star in the Eagle constellation and because: \"Al\" is the first part of the name of the Beriev A-40 \"Albatross\" amphibious aircraft, whose layout was the development basis for the creation of the Be-200; \"ta\" stands for Taganrog; and \"ir\" stands for Irkutsk.\n\nThe Be-200 was designed by the Beriev Aviation Company, with the Russian Irkutsk Aircraft Production Association (now part of the Irkut Corporation). Beriev are responsible for development, design and documentation; systems-, static-, flight- and fatigue-testing of prototypes; certification and support of the production models. Irkut's duties comprise production preparation; manufacture of tooling; production of four prototypes and production aircraft; and spare parts manufacture. Both companies now fall under the umbrella of the state-owned United Aircraft Corporation.\n\nInitiated in 1989 under the design leadership of Alexander Yavkin, Russian government approval for a purpose-designed water bomber was granted on 8 December 1990. Details of the project were announced, and a model displayed at the 1991 Paris Air Show.\n\nBeriev developed unique fire-fighting equipment for the Be-200, allowing it to scoop water while skimming the water surface at 90-95% of takeoff speed. This system was developed using a specially modified Be-12P, coded '12 Yellow'. After installation of the fire-fighting system, the aircraft was registered RA-00046 and given the designation Be-12P-200. This modified Be-12 was used to develop both the fire-fighting system and methods of operation.\n\nThe Be-200's first flight from land was scheduled for 1997, but was eventually achieved by the first prototype aircraft on 24 September 1998. The aircraft was then transferred from Irkutsk to Taganrog after 26.5 flying hours, and the first take off from water was conducted on 10 September 1999 in Taganrog. The second Be-200 flew on August 27, 2002. This aircraft was built as a Be-200ES, being fitted to the specifications of the launch customer, EMERCOM, the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations.\n\nIn 2001, as part of a marketing program, the Be-200 was displayed at two large exhibitions in the Pacific Ocean region; the International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition LIMA'01 in Malaysia and the Korean Aerospace and Defence Exhibition KADE'01 in South Korea.\n\nIn 2002, the Be-200 participated in international aviation exhibitions, successfully demonstrating its capabilities to potential customers in France and Greece with 15 demonstration flights made from land, eight from water. A total of over 7,600 km was flown across Europe.\n\nIrkut and EADS signed a memorandum of understanding in May 2002 to jointly carry out a market study and to define the conditions and costs of international certification and the logistics of setting up a worldwide after-sales service. The study was completed in July 2003, revealing a potential market for up to 320 aircraft over 20 years. The two companies, with Rolls-Royce Deutschland, planned to obtain Western certification during 2008/9 and offer a Rolls-Royce BR715 powered aircraft for Western markets. This version was to be given the designation Be-200RR. The original Be-200 prototype (RF-21511) was earmarked to be converted into the Be-200RR prototype. However, little progress toward a Rolls-Royce version has been made since a joint study concluded in 2004 that because the intended BR715 engine would require extensive redevelopment due to weight and salt-water corrosion issues, break-even would require sales of too many aircraft.\n\nThe first production aircraft, a Be-200ES flew on 17 June 2003. It was delivered to EMERCOM on 31 July 2003. Seven aircraft have been ordered by EMERCOM, five have been delivered. The fifth airframe was used for the European certification process which was expected to be completed in 2008. EASA eventually certified the Be200ES-E on 7 September 2010. The remaining two were scheduled for delivery by the end of 2008. EMERCOM has an option to buy a further 8 Be-200s, with a decision expected during the latter part of 2008.\n\nIn 2010, production of the Be-200 was decided to switch to the \"Centre of competence for amphibian aircraft and flying boats\" in Taganrog. An assembly line was set up using tooling and equipment received from Irkut's main manufacturing site in Irkutsk, Siberia. This will allow the Irkut Corporation to concentrate on other more lucrative projects. Production of the Be-200 will remain under the umbrella of the United Aircraft Corporation. First Taganrog-built aircraft was delivered in early 2017.\n\nIn April 2018, Safran and UEC Saturn agreed to re-engine the BE-200 with the PowerJet SaM146 from the Sukhoi Superjet instead of the Progress D-436. The hope is that the more-modern SaM146 engine, which has passed international certification and complies with prospective ICAO requirements, will allow the aircraft to be more fully introduced to the European and American markets.\n\nThe Be-200 is a high-wing T-tail monoplane. The hull is of single step design with a high length-to-beam ratio, which contributes to stability and controllability in water. The Be-200 airframe is constructed of aluminium alloys with corrosion-protection treatments. Selective use is made of titanium, composites and other corrosion-free materials. The wings are fitted with underwing stabiliser floats. The hydraulically operated retractable landing gear units all retract rearward, and each unit is twin-wheeled. A water rudder provides steering when in the water. It can operate from either a 1,800 m long runway or an area of open water not less than 2,300 m long and 2.5 m deep, with waves of up to 1.3 m high.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by two, over fuselage, pylon-mounted Progress D-436TP engines. The D-436TP is a specific \"maritime\" corrosion-resistant version of the D-436 three shaft turbofan engine, designed especially for the Be-200 amphibian, by Ivchenko Progress ZMKB and manufactured by Motor Sich in Ukraine. These are mounted above the wingroot pods on the landing gear fairings to prevent water spraying into the engines during take-off and landing.\n\nThe Digital Flight Control (Fly-by-wire) cockpit is fitted with modern navigation systems such as satellite navigation (GPS), FMS, autopilot and weather radar. The ARIA 200-M all-weather integrated avionics system, developed by Honeywell with the Moscow Research Institute of Aircraft Equipment, uses six 152 x 203 mm (6 x 8 in) LCDs to display information to the two-man crew.\n\nThe multirole Be-200 can be configured as an amphibious water drop fire-fighting aircraft, a freighter, or as a passenger aircraft—the pressurised and air conditioned cabin allowing transportation of up to 72 passengers. The Be-200 can also be equipped for special missions. When configured as an air ambulance, the aircraft can carry up to 30 stretcher patients and seven seated patients or medical crew. In the search and rescue role, the aircraft can be equipped with searchlights and sensors, an inflatable boat, thermal and optical surveillance systems, and medical equipment. The search and rescue variant can accommodate up to 45 people. The aircraft is also capable of being configured for anti-submarine warfare duties.\n\nThe Be-200 in amphibious water drop fire-fighter configuration suppresses fires by dropping water contained in eight ferric aluminium alloy water tanks, located under the cabin floor in the centre fuselage section. Four retractable water scoops, two forward and two aft of the fuselage step, can be used to scoop a total of 12 tonnes of water in 14 seconds. Alternatively, the tanks can be filled from a hydrant or a water cistern on the ground. The water tanks can be removed quickly for carrying cargo. Water can be dropped in a single salvo, or in up to eight consecutive drops. The aircraft also carries six auxiliary tanks for fire-retarding chemical agents, with a total capacity of 1.2 m³. The aircraft can empty its water tanks over the site of a fire in 0.8 to 1.0 seconds when flying above the minimum drop speed of 220 km/h (135 mph, 120 kn)\n\nThe first documented operational use of the Be-200 was from 20 August till 30 September 2004. For this period a Be-200ES was operated from Sardinia (Italy) by SOREM, the official operator of fire-fighting equipment of Italian Civil Defense Department (Protezione Civile). The aircraft, flown by joint Russian-Italian flight crew performed more than 100 flights with about 90 hours flown. During seven hours of operational flights, the aircraft participated in the extinguishing of four forest fires and dropped 324 tons of water.\n\nThe partnership was renewed in 2005, with Be-200ES (Reg. RF-21512) based at Sardinia between July and September. The aircraft flew 150 hours covering 63 missions, including ferry flights, and 435 scoops and drops of water, the total mass of which exceeded 3,175 tonnes (3,500 tons).\n\nIn 2006 RF-21512 was leased by the Portuguese Fire Fighting Services (SNBPC – Serviço Nacional de Bombeiros e Protecção Civil) for evaluation during the forest fire season. On 6 July 2006, the Russian crew of the Be-200 leased by Portugal were carrying out a water pick-up from the Aguieira dam near Santa Comba Dão, when on climbing away they clipped treetops and at least one of the Progress D-436TP engines suffered ingestion damage and had to be shut down. The aircraft recovered safely to land at Monte Real air force base, from which it had been operating. After repairs, the aircraft completed the season in Portugal. In total, 42 flights were performed during operations in Portugal, with a total flying time of 119 hours. The aircraft performed 301 water scooping operations and dropped 2,167 tonnes (2,389 tons) of water on fires.\n\nIn October 2006, two Be-200ES (RF-32765 and RF-32768) were leased to Indonesia by EMERCOM, fighting fires for 45 days. This reportedly cost Indonesia around US$5.2 million. These operations prompted press reports that the Indonesian government had agreed to purchase two Be-200s, each with a projected price of US$40 million. Beriev, however has not confirmed these reports.\n\nSuch was the success of the first campaign that two Be-200ES were again leased by Portugal from July 10 to September 30, 2007. During this period 58 fire-fighting flights were conducted with a total flying time of over 167 hours. 2,322 tonnes (2,560 tons) of water was dropped. Beriev claims that representatives of the newly formed Portuguese government enterprise EMA (Empresa de Meios Aéreos) have expressed their interest in a long-term cooperation with Beriev and the Be-200 in Portugal.\n\nTwo Be-200ES also operated in Greece, RF-32768 fighting the 2007 forest fires for the whole season and RF-21512 from August 30 to September 13.\n\nIn April 2008, Azerbaijan became the first foreign customer for the Be-200, purchasing one Be-200ES from Russia. The aircraft (reg. FHN-10201 ex RF-32769) is operated by the Azerbaijan Ministry of Emergency Situations and can be operated as a fire-fighting, cargo and 43-seater passenger aircraft.\n\nIn July/August 2010 it was used in Russia during the wildfires that spread across the country.\n\nIn early December 2010, two Be-200ES aircraft were used to fight the 2010 Mount Carmel forest fire near Haifa, Israel.\n\nIn Serbia one Be-200 belonging to Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations is stationed in summer on Niš Constantine the Great Airport. Aircraft has already operational history in 2012 and 2013.\n\nA Be-200 was dispatched by Russia in January 2015 to assist in search and recovery operations following the loss of Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 in the Java Sea. On October 20, 2015, two Be-200s were used by the Indonesian government to fight a forest fire in Sumatra.\n\nIn August 2016 two Be-200 aircraft were sent to Portugal after being asked for help in extinguishing forest fires. Four days later it was reported that thanks to the work of the Russian Emergencies Ministry Be-200 pilots, the fire was prevented from spreading in the direction of two settlements: Castro Laboreiro with a population of 1,000 people, and Viaden de Baixo, where 15 farms were saved from fire, and Peneda-Gerês National Park.\n\nChina bought two, with an option for two more, of the Be-200 aircraft during the Zhuhai Airshow in 2016. The contract was signed in June 2017.\n\nA firm called International Emergency Services (“IES”), housed at the Santa Maria Public Airport in California, US has been trying for some years to bring the BE-200 to the United States in its fire-fighting role. An organisation called the USA Firefighting Air Corps (“USAFAC”) said in September 2014 that it had signed a collaboration agreement with IES to develop a U.S.-built BE-200 in Colorado; however, while the USAFAC website maintains a BE-200 photo, no further information is provided on the status of the project. There was also discussion at a Santa Maria Public Airport District meeting in October 2016 of IES, Seaplane Global Air Services (“SGAS”) and Airbus partnering to build the aircraft at the Santa Maria airport. Meanwhile, in September 2018, SGAS ordered from the manufacturer four Be-200ES aircraft with an option for six more. The first two aircraft will be equipped with D-436TP engines, the eight others with the SaM146 engines. According to some reports, SGAS has plans to wet- and dry-lease the water-bombers in partnership with IES, offering services in several countries, including the US, European nations, and Australia.\n\n\n\n"}
