A city proper is not limited to a city; it can describe the complete area of any locality that fits the definition. The United Nations defines the term as \"the single political jurisdiction which contains the historical city centre.\"\n\nCity proper is one of the three basic concepts used to define urban areas and populations. The other two are urban agglomeration, and the metropolitan area. In some countries, city limits that act as the demarcation for the city proper are drawn very wide, in some very narrow. This can be cause for recurring controversy.\n\nIn its strict sense, city proper is used as a technical term in demography, the statistical study of human populations. Under the title \"World Urbanization Prospects\", the United Nations issues every two years estimates and projections of the urban and rural populations of all countries of the world. The book defines the population of a city proper as \"the population living within the administrative boundaries of a city.\" The book continues to say that \"city proper as defined by administrative boundaries may not include suburban areas where an important proportion of the population working or studying in the city lives.\" \n\nIn demography, city proper is one of the three basic concepts used to define urban areas and populations. The other two are urban agglomeration, and the metropolitan area. In addition, there are Census Statistical Areas and permutations thereof.\n\nA United Nations University working paper titled \"Urban Settlement\" reviews the most commonly used data sources, and highlights the difficulties inherent in defining and measuring the size of urban versus rural populations. It says: \"The city proper is determined by legal and administrative criteria, and typically comprises only those geographical areas that are part of a legally defined, and often historically-established administrative unit. However, many urban areas have grown far beyond the limits of the city proper, necessitating other measures. An urban agglomeration is the de facto population contained within the contours of a contiguous territory inhabited at urban density levels without regard to administrative boundaries’. Urban agglomerations are thus determined by density: the agglomeration ends where the density of settlement drops below some critical threshold. A still more comprehensive concept is the metropolitan area.\"\n\nIn short, there is no \"right\" manner to define a city or municipality; city proper is just one manner.\n\nThe term is a combination of \"city\" in the sense of \"an incorporated administrative district\", and \"proper\" in the sense of \"strictly limited to a specified thing, place, or idea\" or \"strictly accurate\". In encyclopedias, the term \"city proper\" is often used as an example to illustrate the meaning of the word \"proper\" in the sense of \"tightly defined\".\n\nEspecially when translated from the English or back, \"city proper\" sometimes takes on different meanings in different parts of the world. Some languages have no equivalent.\n\nThe United Nations Demographic Yearbook is compiled using questionnaires dispatched annually to more than 230 national statistical offices. These questionnaires ask for the country-specific definition of urban areas, rural areas and city proper. In its glossary, the Yearbook defines \"city proper\" as \"a locality defined according to legal/political boundaries and an administratively recognized urban status that is usually characterized by some form of local government\". In its data however, the United Nations Demographic Yearbook affords the individual countries considerable leeway over the definition of \"city proper\". The table titled \"Population of capital cities and cities of 100 000 or more inhabitants\" provides several country-specific definitions for \"city proper\" that diverge from the provided definition:\nThese definitions are those given for the purpose of the United Nations Demographic Yearbook. One should not assume that these necessarily are the prevailing definitions in their respective countries.\n\nIn some countries, city limits that act as the demarcation for the city proper are drawn very wide, or very narrow. This can be cause for recurring controversy.\n\n\"List of cities by surface area\" lists little known cities that are larger than many countries. By area, the city of Altamira, Brazil (population 84,000) is bigger than Greece. The City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder (population 32,000) covers more area than Hungary, Portugal, Austria, or Ireland. While these examples cause limited debate, cities in China are a source of continuing disagreement.\n\nThe Chinese city of Hulunbuir in Inner Mongolia is recognized as the largest city in the world by area. According to the \"Urban Settlement\" working paper, \"in 1986, to cope with growing administrative demands at the local level, China essentially reclassified counties as cities in order to allow local city governments to control the surrounding areas\". The authors state that \"the Chinese city of Chongqing is another case in point. Even though the municipal district of Chongqing has a total population of more than 30 million inhabitants, fewer than 6 million actually live in Chongqing city proper. Depending on which classification is used, Chongqing is sometimes listed as the world's largest city and, in other cases, does not even appear in the top rung of urban population rankings\". (Note the context of \"city proper\".)\n\nYunyan Yang describes the problems one is faced with when interpreting population data of Chinese cities proper, using the example of Wuhan. \"Misconceptions and Complexities in the Study of China's Cities: Definitions, Statistics, and Implications\", an article that appeared in the Journal of Eurasian Geography and Economics, illustrates and clarifies factors leading to misunderstanding and misconceptions regarding the number of inhabitants of China's major cities. (In their paper, the authors use \"city proper\" in the context of \"city districts\", and not as the larger administrative area.)\n\nOn the other side of the extreme is Metropolitan Lagos. This city has a population of nearly 8 million according to the latest census, which is debated. Official data by the Lagos State estimate the population of Metropolitan Lagos at more than 14 million. However, there is no Metropolitan Government. The Municipality of Lagos was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several Local Government Areas. As a result, the most populous city in Africa, and one of the most populous and fastest growing cities in the world can be missing from lists of cities proper. A similar situation exists in Australia, where large cities are divided into much smaller Local Government Areas. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2116064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116064", "title": "Disk magazine", "text": "Disk magazine\n\nA disk magazine, colloquially known as a diskmag or diskzine, is a magazine that is distributed in electronic form to be read using computers. These had some popularity in the 1980s and 1990s as periodicals distributed on floppy disk, hence their name. The rise of the Internet in the late 1990s caused them to be superseded almost entirely by online publications, which are sometimes still called \"diskmags\" despite the lack of physical disks.\n\nA unique and defining characteristic about a diskmag in contrast to a typical ASCII \"zine\" or \"t-file\" (or even \"g-file\") is that a diskmag usually comes housed as an executable program file that will only run on a specific hardware platform. A diskmag tends to have an aesthetically appealing and custom graphical user interface (or even interfaces), background music and other features that take advantage of the hardware platform the diskmag was coded for. Diskmags have been written for many platforms, ranging from the C64 on up to the IBM PC and have even been created for video game consoles, like scenedicate for the Dreamcast.\n\nEarly home and hobby users of personal computers in the late 1970s and early 1980s sometimes typed in programs, usually in the BASIC language, which were published in the computer magazines of the time. This was a lot of work, and prone to error, so the idea of publishing a magazine directly on a computer-readable medium so that the programs could be run directly without typing came independently to several people.\n\nSome ideas of putting bar codes into paper magazines, which could be read into a computer with the appropriate peripheral, were floated at the time, but never caught on. Since the common data storage medium of the earliest home computers was the audio cassette, the first magazine published on a physical computer medium was actually a cassette magazine rather than a disk magazine; \"CLOAD\" magazine, for the Radio Shack TRS-80 computer, began publication in 1978, named after the command to load a program from cassette on that computer system.\n\n\"CLOAD\" was not the first electronic periodical, however, because various ARPANET digests had been published as text files sent around the network since the early 1970s. These, however, were pure ASCII text and hence were not diskmags by the current definition. Also, at the time, few people outside of academic institutions had access to this forerunner of the Internet.\n\nIn September, 1981, the first issue of \"Softdisk\" was published for Apple II computers; coming out monthly on a 5¼\" diskette, this was the first floppy-disk-based periodical. This was the first publication of a company also known as Softdisk which would later bring out similar publications for the Commodore 64, IBM PC, and Apple Macintosh. Of these magazines, the one for the Commodore 64, called \"Loadstar\", continued publishing until issue 249 in 2007 - making it the longest running disk software magazine in history. Other publishers produced a variety of competing publications, including \"Diskazine\", \"Window\", \"I.B.Magazette\", \"UPTIME\", and \"PC Life\". The Atari ST, in 1986, saw the first disk magazine in the shape of \"ST News\". This was an English-language on-disk magazine from the Netherlands. Some publishers of paper magazines published disk companions, either polybagged with the magazines (in the form of so-called covermounts) or available as separate subscriptions.\n\nIn the early 1990s, id Software founders John Carmack and John Romero had some of their earliest works published on disk magazines while working for Softdisk. A short-lived game subscription called \"Gamer's Edge\" published side-scrolling and 3D games written by the team that would later create \"Commander Keen\" and \"Doom\".\n\nBy the mid-1990s, CD-ROMs were taking over from floppy disks as the major data storage and transfer medium. Some of the existing disk magazines switched to this format while others, such as Digital Culture Stream, were founded as CD-based magazines from the start. The higher capacity of this format, along with the faster speed of newer computers, allowed disk magazines to provide more of a multimedia experience, including music and animation. Such things as movie trailers and music samples could now be provided, allowing a disk magazine to target fans of the entertainment industry rather than the computer hobbyists of the earlier times.\n\nMany disk magazines of the 1990s and later are connected with the demoscene, including \"Grapevine\", for the Amiga computer. Demoscene diskmags have been known to cross over into the closely neighboring underground computer art scene and warez scenes as well. Some of the more commonly well known English diskmags include: \"Hugi\", \"Imphobia\", \"Pain\", \"Scenial\", \"Daskmig\" (IBM PC), \"Jurassic Pack\", \"RAW\", \"Upstream\", \"ROM\", \"Seenpoint\", \"Generation\" (Amiga), \"Undercover Magascene\", \"Chaos Control Digizine\", \"Maggie\", \"DBA Diskmagazine\", \"Alive\" and \"ST News\" (Atari ST).\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Internet became popular among the general public, which had the effect of killing the market for disk-based publications because people could now access the same sorts of material through the net. As a result, disk-based periodicals became uncommon, as publishers of electronic magazines preferred to use the Web or e-mail as their distribution medium.\n\nDemoscene magazines based on executable program files are still commonly called diskmags, although they are seldom distributed on physical disks any more. Bulletin board systems and the Internet took over as major distribution channels for these magazines already in the 1990s.\n\nThe occasional CD- or DVD-based multimedia magazine has come out since 2000, though more often as a promotional gimmick than a self-sustaining publication. More effort has lately gone into creating and promoting Web sites, ezines, blogs, and e-mail lists than physical-medium-based publications. Some publications that are termed \"diskmags\" are today distributed through the internet (FTP, WWW, IRC, etc.). The former entertainment disk magazine \"Launch\" transformed into the online video site \"LAUNCHcast\", owned by Yahoo!. \"Blender\" also began life as a CD-ROM diskmag with US-wide\ndistribution. It later transitioned to print. However, with the popularity of tablet computers and portable e-book readers, some print publications are transitioning to electronic form, and other all-electronic publications are starting up.\n\nThe longest-lasting disk magazine is, surprisingly enough, for the long-obsolete Commodore 64 computer; \"Loadstar\", originally published by Softdisk starting in 1984, and later an independent company, has continued publishing well into the 2000s for a \"cult following\" of Commodore buffs.\n\nDisk magazines differed in the sorts of material they emphasised. Several distinct sorts of things could be published in an electronic periodical, and different ones might have all or most of their content in one or another of these categories:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2116072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116072", "title": "Mordechai ben Hillel", "text": "Mordechai ben Hillel\n\nMordechai ben Hillel HaKohen (c. 1250–1298), also known as The Mordechai, was a 13th-century German rabbi and posek. His chief legal commentary on the Talmud, referred to as \"The Mordechai\", is one of the sources of the \"Shulchan Aruch\". He was killed in the Rintfleisch massacres in 1298.\n\nLittle is known of Mordechai's early life. He belonged to one of the most prominent families of scholars in Germany: his grandfather Hillel, on his mother's side, was a grandson of Eliezer ben Joel ha-Levi, who was in turn a grandson of Eliezer ben Nathan. Mordechai was also a relative of Rabbi Asher ben Jehiel. He was married to Zelda, with whom he had five children.\n\nHis principal teacher was Meir ben Baruch of Rothenburg; he was also taught by Perez ben Elijah of Corbeil, Ephraim ben Nathan, Abraham ben Baruch (Meir of Rothenburg's brother), and Dan Ashkenazi. In addition to his knowledge of Talmud and Halakha, the Mordechai was also an expert on Hebrew grammar.\n\nAbout 1291 the family moved to Goslar. But his right of residence there was disputed by a certain Moses Tako (not the famous Moses Taku); although the suit was decided in Mordechai's favor, it was conducted with such bitterness that Mordechai left Goslar and settled at Nuremberg. For the next seven years, he operated a Yeshiva there which attracted students from all over Europe. The Mordechai was murdered, along with his wife and children, in the Rintfleisch Massacres; \"see Nuremberg: Middle Ages\".\n\nMordechai is a prominent legal (Halachic) work, which acquired wide authority, and was one of the sources of the \"Shulchan Aruch\" of Joseph Caro; it has also been printed as an appendix to the Talmud, since the Soncino edition of 1482. The work is written as a compilation of existing halakhic material, and also provides conclusions and results of long discussions in other works. It thus serves both a source of analysis, as well a source of decided law. Mordechai's knowledge of halakhic literature was extensive. He quotes the works, and written or verbal responsa, of about 350 authorities; in fact, \"Mordechai\" is now the only source for many Ashkenazi authors. He frequently quotes his teacher, Meir ben Baruch, and much of the \"Mordechai\" is written in support of the Tosafists, the last of whom were Mordechai's teachers.\n\nThe Ashkenazi authorities, as well as those in Italy, were great admirers of Mordechai, and assiduously studied the \"Mordechai\" and recognized its authority as a source of Halakha. Moses Isserles lectured on the \"Mordechai\" in his yeshivah, and many of his responsa are devoted to questions regarding difficult passages of the book. Its status was such, that the \"Mordechai\" is one of the sources of the \"Shulchan Aruch\" of Joseph Caro. In Italy and Poland, where the \"Mordechai\" was especially studied, a whole \"Mordechai\" literature came into existence.\n\nThe \"Mordechai\", although linked textually with the \"Halakhot\" of Rabbi Isaac Alfasi, is, in fact, an independent work. The connection with Alfasi is an external one: single sentences, sometimes even single words, of the \"Halakhot\" serve as \"catchwords\" introducing the relevant material found in the Jerusalem Talmud, the tosafot, as well as other codices and compendiums. The \"Mordechai\" is published in two forms: glosses to Alfasi's \"Halakhot\" in various manuscripts, and also as an appendix to the \"Halakhot\" - the standard form in today's editions of the Talmud.\n\nAs early critics pointed out, the \"Mordechai\" was not issued in its final form by the Mordechai. He collected the material, but the work was in fact arranged and published by his pupils, partly during his lifetime and partly after his death. Thus within two generations after Mordechai's death there were two entirely different versions of his work, respectively designated as the \"Rhenish\" and the \"Austrian\" versions. These two versions are also respectively known as the \"Short Mordechai\" (מרדכי הקצר \"Mordekhai haKetzar\") and \"Long Mordechai\" (מרדכי הארוך \"Mordekhai ha'Arokh\"), due to their varying length. These are not merely two different copies of the \"Mordechai\", but are in fact two materially different compendiums. It is thought that the Austrian \"Mordechai\", as found in the manuscripts, is the original form of the work. The version published in the Talmud is the Rhenish with glosses from the Austrian Mordechai, by Rabbi Samuel ben Aaron of Schlettstallt.\n\nMordechai was the author of Responsa - however, these have not been preserved but are quoted in other works and responsa; see: History of Responsa: Twelfth century.\n\nHe authored several selichot.\n\n"}

She is a former American professional women's basketball player in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) and a basketball television analyst for ESPN and the Washington Wizards. Lawson primarily played as a shooting guard. She won a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China. Lawson retired from the WNBA in 2015 to focus on her broadcasting career.\n\nLawson attended Sidwell Friends School her freshman year, then went to West Springfield High School, where she played on the girls' basketball and soccer teams. Lawson was named a WBCA All-American. She participated in the 1999 WBCA High School All-America Game, where she scored twenty points, and earned MVP honors.\n\nLawson attended the University of Tennessee (UT) and played for the Lady Vols basketball team, coached by Pat Summitt. She enrolled in UT's College of Business, and graduated in 2003 with a degree in Finance. Lawson received the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award from the Women's Basketball Coaches Association as the best senior player under 5 ft 8 in (1.7 m). In 2018, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam named Lawson to the Board of Trustees of the University of Tennessee, the governing body of the UT system.\n\nSource\n\nOn April 24, 2003, Lawson was selected as the fifth overall pick by the Detroit Shock in the first round of the 2003 WNBA draft. But five days later, the Shock traded Lawson to the Sacramento Monarchs in exchange for Kedra Holland-Corn and a 2004 second-round draft pick. Two years later, Lawson would be a key member of the Monarchs 2005 championship team.\n\nIn recent years, Lawson has been involved in sports broadcasting during the WNBA off-season, doing commentaries for men's and women's college basketball games and Sacramento Kings games. Lawson was a free agent when the Sacramento Monarchs folded prior to the 2010 WNBA season, but later signed a three-year contract with the Connecticut Sun. On March 12, 2014, Lawson was traded to the Washington Mystics for Alex Bentley, who was originally traded to Washington through the Atlanta Dream.\n\nLawson was selected to be a member of the United States national team team at the 2001 World University Games held in Beijing, China. After winning the opening game easily, the USA team faced Canada and lost a close game 68–67. Needing a win to remain in medal contention, Lawson scored 25 points to help the USA team defeat Japan, and earn a spot in the quarterfinals. The USA team fell behind by 12 points against undefeated Russia, but came back to win the game by eleven points. The next game was against the unbeaten host team China, and the USA team won 89–78. The USA team won their next two games to set up the gold medal game; a rematch against the host team. China would stay close early, but the USA team prevailed and won the gold medal with a score of 87–67. Lawson was the third leading scorer on the team with 12.0 points per game and led the team in assists and steal with 16 assists and 12 steals over the course of the event.\n\nOn July 10, 2008, Lawson was selected to represent the United States with the USA women's national basketball team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. She helped the United States capture the gold medal, and led the team in points (15) during the gold medal game against Australia, going a perfect 5-5 from the field and 4-4 from the free throw line.\n\nLawson was invited to the USA Basketball Women's National Team training camp in the fall of 2009. The team selected to play for the 2010 FIBA World Championship and the 2012 Olympics is usually chosen from these participants. At the conclusion of the training camp, the team will travel to Ekaterinburg, Russia, where they compete in the 2009 UMMC Ekaterinburg International Invitational.\n\nLawson was one of 21 finalists for the U.S. Women’s Olympic Basketball Team Roster. The 20 professional women's basketball players, plus one collegiate player (Brittney Griner), were selected by the USA Basketball Women’s National Team Player Selection Committee to compete for the final roster to represent the US at the 2012 Olympics in London, United Kingdom. However, Lawson did not make the final roster.\n\nLawson began her broadcasting career while still playing in the WNBA. She served as a studio analyst for the Sacramento Kings, and worked her way up to working in a variety of NBA and WNBA broadcast roles for ESPN. On January 12, 2007, she was the first woman to work as a nationwide broadcast analyst for an NBA game, when the New Orleans Hornets took on the Washington Wizards.\n\nIn 2017, Lawson was named the primary television game analyst for the Washington Wizards, replacing longtime analyst Phil Chenier as full-time host. She is one of the first primary female TV analysts for an NBA team, joining Sarah Kustok of the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nOn June 27, 2019, it was announced that Kara Lawson would be joining the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA) as an assistant coach.\n\nLawson is married to Damien Barling, whom she met while working in Sacramento soon after the Monarchs' WNBA championship win.

He also held the office of Hereditary Keeper of Raglan Castle and was President of the British Horse Society.\n\nDavid Somerset was the second son of Captain Henry Robert Somers FitzRoy de Vere Somerset (1898—1965), by his marriage in 1922 to Bettine Violet Malcolm, a daughter of Major C. E. Malcolm. He was educated at Eton College. His father was the grandson of Lord Henry Somerset, second son of the 8th Duke of Beaufort and the temperance activist Lady Isabella Somers-Cocks.\n\nHe and his family were descended in the male line from Edward III of England; the first Somerset was a legitimised son of Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, whose grandfather was a legitimized son of John of Gaunt. By the time he succeeded as Duke he was therefore considered the senior representative of the House of Plantagenet, through a legitimised line. Somerset's father was the heir presumptive to the Dukedom of Beaufort and the large estates attached to it.\n\nBy the time he was about twelve, it was becoming clear that his father's third cousin Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort, was unlikely to have a son, unless his childless wife Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort, died and he remarried, and that Somerset's father and elder brother were almost the heirs apparent. And then the outlook changed in April 1945, when his elder brother John Alexander Somerset was killed in action in the Allied invasion of Germany. As a result, at the age of seventeen Somerset himself became the likely heir.\n\nDavid Somerset, as he then was, was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards on 6 September 1946 as a second lieutenant. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 January 1949.\n\nAfter his years in the British Army, Somerset took up residence in Gloucestershire, hunted with the Beaufort Hunt, and following his father's death in 1965 it was increasingly certain that he or one of his sons would be the next Duke of Beaufort. He finally succeeded to the family titles and estates in 1984.\n\nAs Duke of Beaufort, he was a major landowner and figure in the world of fox hunting, and he became well known for a raffish reputation and also for frequent conflicts with hunt saboteurs. He held the office of Hereditary Keeper of Raglan Castle, was President of the British Horse Society between 1988 and 1990, and was chairman of Marlborough Fine Art. He ranked 581st in the \"Sunday Times\" Rich List 2008, with an estimated wealth of £135m in land and 52,000 acres. The Duke was nominated to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nHe had a seat in the House of Lords, where he sat as a Conservative from 1984 to 1999. He was one of those who lost their seats as a result of New Labour's reforms in the House of Lords Act 1999.\n\nThe Duke was criticised in January 2009 when a Swansea councillor, Ioan Richard, discovered by a Freedom of Information Act request that he had been paid £281,431 for a 70 ft bridge to be built over the River Tawe near Swansea. The Dukes of Beaufort had owned the river bed for some 400 years, so when the local council had wanted to build a bridge linking a shopping centre to the Liberty Stadium, home of Swansea City football club and the Ospreys rugby team, it had to pay the Duke for the right to cross his river bed. Ioan Richard stated that he was \"furious that public money had to be used to pay one of Britain's richest estates. For centuries Swansea folk have paid rents to the Duke of Beaufort and we don't owe this powerful and wealthy family anything.\" A spokesman for the duke's estate at Badminton House responded: \"We do not want to comment about a private transaction.\"\n\nBeaufort died on 16 August 2017 at Badminton House, Gloucestershire, at the age of 89.\n\nHe married, firstly, Lady Caroline Jane Thynne (28 August 1928 – 22 April 1995), daughter of the 6th Marquess of Bath, on 5 July 1950. The marriage took place at St Peter's Church, Eaton Square, in the presence of the King and Queen and members of the royal family.\n\nThe Duchess of Beaufort presided over the restoration of Badminton House and its grounds. She received an honorary degree (LLD) from Bristol University for her charitable work.\n\nThey had four children:\n\nThe Duke married, secondly, Miranda Elisabeth Morley (born 1947), on 2 June 2000. She is a daughter of Brigadier General Michael Frederick Morley.\n\nThe Duke's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son.\n\n\n"}

It premièred in Antwerp in 2001 in Dutch, and was translated into French and premièred a year later in Charleroi as \"Tintin – Le Temple du Soleil\".\n\nNote: This refers to the musical itself, not the books, and therefore use the Dutch names – English equivalents are given.\n\nAn expedition of seven scientists, the Sanders-Hardiman expedition, discovers the tomb of the Incan mummy Rascar Capac and provokes the anger of the Sun God. A curse descends upon them. Meanwhile, Kuifje (Tintin) and Bobbie (Snowy) arrive on the train at Molensloot (Marlinspike), and Kuifje talks to another traveller about the recent return of the expedition from Peru. He says that all will end badly, desecrating the burial chambers of the Incas like Tutankhamen's – five members of the expedition have already been mysteriously struck down.\n\nKuifje and Bobbie go to Kasteel Molensloot (Marlinspike Hall) where Kapitein Haddock (Captain Haddock) lives, and they meet Nestor the butler. He says that Haddock is currently horse-riding, but he shortly returns minus the horse. Haddock introduces their old friend Trifonius Zonnebloem (Professor Calculus), and then tries to show Kuifje a magic trick to turn water into whisky, which fails. Angry at not being able to do it, he takes Kuifje to the music hall to see Bruno the magician perform the trick.\n\nThat evening at the music hall, Kuifje and Haddock watch a performance by the opera singer Bianca Castafiore, which Bobbie turns into an impromptu duet. Haddock storms out from the show because of Castafiore's singing. Ragdalam the fakir and Yamilah the clairvoyant perform after Castafiore; after a few novelty predictions, Ragdalam asks Yamilah to tell him about a woman in the audience, Mevrouw Heining (Mrs Clarkson). She says that her husband is a photographer, and that he has been struck down by the curse of Rascar Capac. Mevrouw Heining leaves the show with her daughter, Fleur, when she receives a message that her husband is indeed ill. The magician's act is on, and Haddock stumbles onto the stage with a stage prop of a cow's head on his, after having got lost backstage trying to find his way out.\n\nKuifje, Haddock, and Zonnebloem go to the home of Professor Hippòlytus Bergamot (Professor Hercules Tarragon) to protect him, as he and Zonnebloem were students together. The detectives Janssen and Jansen (Thomson and Thompson) have also been sent to protect Bergamot. Bergamot reveals the mummy of Rascar Capac, and Kuifje reads the prophecy that the expedition found in his tomb. A storm comes, a ball of lightning comes down the chimney, destroys the mummy, and Bergamot realises that the prophecy is true. He is then struck down by the curse like the others.\n\nAt the hospital, Fleur and her mother sit by the bed of Heining. Kuifje arrives following Bergamot's attack, and Fleur asks him to help her 'papa'. Kuifje says he will, and leaves the hospital, whilst Fleur reassures her mother that everything will be alright because Kuifje will help them. In the garden, Zonnebloem mysteriously disappears following his donning the bracelet.\n\nLater at Molensloot, Haddock is depressed because of Zonnebloem's disappearance. Castafiore, her accompanist Igor Wagner, and her maid Irma arrive; Castafiore announcing she will be staying for a period. Haddock and Kuifje manage to escape and head to the docks, where they discover that Zonnebloem has been spotted on the ship \"Pachacamac\" and is going to Peru. They catch a flying boat to Peru, and as it flies into the distance, the curtain closes on Act One.\n\nIn Peru, Kuife and Haddock ask whether anyone has seen Zonnebloem, but are met with \"No sé\" (\"I don't know\") from everyone. Kuifje and Bobbie intervene to stop two men bullying a child. The child, Zorrino, reveals that he is an orphan living on the streets. Kuifje cheers him up by making him a little boat out of newspaper. Zorrino reveals that he knows where Zonnebloem is – he has been taken to the Zonnetempel (the Temple of the Sun). Zorrino leads them on a trek to the temple, with many perils against them. Bobbie is taken by a condor, and Kuifje climbs to the top of a cliff to look for him. He is attacked by the condor and, hanging onto its legs, is carried to the ground where he discovers Bobbie.\n\nMeanwhile, the Janssens have found Zonnebloem's pendulum and attempt to use it to locate him. They mistake the indications given by the pendulum, and travel to the North Pole and meet an Eskimo, to the Far East, and to Scotland. Eventually they realise that the pendulum is pointing to Peru, where Kuifje and Haddock are, and head off in pursuit.\n\nKuifje, Haddock and Zorrino reach a waterfall. Zorrino and Haddock cross without incident, but as Kuifje crosses, with Bobbie in his rucksack, the rope snaps and they fall through the waterfall. He survives the fall and Haddock and Zorrino join him on the other side of the waterfall, in a cavern. At the same time, an Incan ceremony is taking place. Suddenly, Kuifje, Bobbie, Haddock and Zorrino crash through a hidden door in the wall.\n\nThey are blindfolded, and the Grote Inca (the Great Inca) declares that their punishment for profaning the temple is to die at the stake, but grants them one last wish : they are allowed to choose the day and hour of their deaths. Zorrino is separated from the others, visits them in their cell, and unfolds the little boat that Kuifje had made him. Kuifje reads the newspaper and finds their salvation. He tells the Incan guard that they wish to die in eighteen days' time. When the day comes, they are bound to the stake on the funeral pyre whilst a ceremony takes place. The Janssens arrive, having finally found Zonnebloem; they are also tied up. As they are about to be sacrificed, Kuifje \"commands\" the Sun; everything goes dark as the Moon moves in front of the Sun's face. Kuifje reveals to a startled Haddock that he read about the solar eclipse in the newspaper!\n\nThe Grote Inca begs Kuifje to make the Sun show its light again, and he does so. The Inca sets them free, as they have the favour of the Sun. Kuifje asks for the curse of Rascar Capac to be lifted, and in Europe the expedition members awake, to the delight of Mevrouw Heining and Fleur, who thank Kuifje. Back in Peru, the Grote Inca adopts Zorrino, and as everyone comes together, the cast takes their bows. The curtain falls.\n\n\nThe show boasts an impressive orchestral score composed by Dirk Brossé with lyrics by Seth Gaaikema and performed by Het Nationaal Orkest Van België (the National Orchestra of Belgium). There are around twenty different songs in the show, and a few reprises. The two main themes that run throughout the show are Haddock's (first heard when he performs the trick with the whisky, later heard in full at the docks) and \"De Zon\", or Kuifje's theme, sung first after his leaving the hospital and as a finale.\n\nTwo CDs were released for the actual show – the first, a single of \"De Zon\" released on 9 April 2001 featured the actors playing Kuifje and Haddock, and a children's choir plus an instrumental version of the song. It also contained interactive features and some desktop wallpapers.\n\nThe second CD (released on 2 October 2001) was a full cast album for the show, containing 18 studio-recorded songs sung by the original cast. Most songs were present in their full versions as heard in the show, in the correct chronological order.\n\nHowever, four songs were omitted completely – one, \"Wandelen in de zon met Zonnebloem\" takes place in the garden of Bergamot's villa; two others are sung by Castafiore and are heard at Molensloot in the first act \"De Milanese Nachtegaal\", and in her dressing room in the second act \"Het leven is als een Opera\". The last one is Bruno's song \"Niets in mouw\" that lasts about 30 seconds in the show. None of the reprises were recorded for the cast album.\n\nA third CD released in 2002 contained a thirteen-minute orchestral suite based on some of the songs appearing in the show. The music was performed by the JWF Military Orchestra, conducted by Jørgen Jensen. It is listed in the Audio Releases section below.\n\nA fourth CD was recorded in 2007 during a try-out in Kursaal Oostende. This recording has 19 tracks and is different than the second CD. 2 Radio tracks were added (Kuifje en Bobbie / De zon) so the total tracks on this CD is 21.\n\nThe show features an incredible array of special effects and imaginative staging, including :\n\n\n\n\nThe show itself is two hours and ten minutes long, excluding the interval. It was professionally filmed for Dutch television and broadcast in its edited form on Canal+, in widescreen. It featured additional digital effects, such as bats flying during the descent into the tomb. The edits removed some of the delays inevitable with a live show, and a couple of sequences such as Zonnebloem and Bergamot's waltz (but still appeared on the CD), which in the live show was necessary as a 'stage wait'.\n\nIt has never seen a repeat broadcast or a commercial release, although personal recordings circulate amongst fans.\n\nIn 2007 the musical came to stage again this time with Jelle Cleymans as 'Kuifje'. First in 'Het nieuwe Luxor' Rotterdam, The Netherlands from May 22 until June 17, and then from July 8 until August 19 in Oostende, Belgium. Then finally it returned to Antwerp, where it was performed from October 18 until its final, November 1.\n\nThe show was adapted as a French performance that premièred at Charleroi in 2002 as Tintin – Le Temple du Soleil – Le Spectacle Musical. It was also scheduled to be performed in Paris at the Hippodrome d'Auteuil on 8 November 2003, but was cancelled due to production difficulties.\n\nReleased in a cardboard sleeve with accompanying leaflet advertising booking for the show. The CD features interactive content such as lyrics and desktop wallpapers.\n\nPackaged in a jewel case with 24-page booklet containing full lyrics and cast photographs.\n\nThe second track is an orchestral suite composed of excerpts from the songs on the cast album, namely \"Rascar Capac, Als het kampvuur brandt, De professorenwals, Vriendschap tot het eind der tijden, De brandstapel\" & \"De Zon (finale)\". The suite's running time is 13:31.\n\nRadio tracks\n\nPackaged in a jewel case with 24-page booklet containing full lyrics and cast photographs.\nTracks 1–19 were recorded live on May 12, 2007, in Kursaal Oostende.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1548 by Pope Paul III, it was the world's first Jesuit college and today it is considered one of the oldest universities in Italy.\n\nIt is organized in 12 departments offering more than 80 Graduate and Undergraduate Degrees, over 20 Master's Degrees and 13 PhD Programmes. Among them, 7 are English-taught. The University counts more than 23.000 students distributed in the 4 campus facilities spread across the city.\n\nOver the centuries the University of Messina has been a centre of attraction for esteemed scholars and historical figures, such as Giovanni Pascoli, Marcello Malpighi, Gaetano Salvemini and Vittorio Emanuele Orlando.\n\nThe university comprises 12 departments:\n\n\nThe University occupies four main sites in Messina:\n\nThe Central Administration Buildings and the Faculties of Economics, Political Science, Law and Education are located in the centre of Messina in the historical site of the University or \"Polo Centrale\".\n\nThe Faculty of Medicine is held in the main hospital of the city \"Policlinico G. Martino\", situated in the southern area of Messina.\n\nThe Faculties of Sciences and Engineering are located inside \"Polo Papardo\", overlooking the famous Strait of Messina.\n\nThe Faculties of Veterinary Medicine, Pharmacy and Humanities are established in the \"Polo Annunziata\" facility, which is also the Sport Centre of the University.\n\nThe \"Studiorum Universitas\" was formally established by Pope Paul III in November 1548, although the city of the Strait boasts an ancient cultural tradition as well as a teaching tradition connected to a Law school in the late 13th century and a well-known Ancient Languages school in the 15th century.\n\nHowever, the regular working activity of the Athenaeum was paralysed by disputes with the Jesuits, in order to prevent them from monopolizing the Universities of the whole island.\n\nThe University began its activities only in 1596. It was the beginning of a short but intense existence which ended in 1678, when the Athenaeum was closed as a result of the anti-Spanish insurrection. During these years the University of Messina represented a strong political and cultural influence. It reached high levels, featuring top professors including Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, Pietro Castelli, Giovan Battista Cortesi, Carlo Fracassati, Giacomo Gallo, Mario Giurba, Marcello Malpighi and Francesco Maurolico.\n\nThe Athenaeum was refinanced in 1838 by King Ferdinando II, but it was closed again in 1847 because of an Anti-Bourbon Revolt and reopened only 2 years later.\n\nAfter these years the University included numerous prominent lecturers such as Pietro Bonfante, Leonardo Coviello, Vittorio Martinetti, Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, Giovanni Pascoli and Gaetano Salvemini.\n\nIn 1908 an earthquake destroyed the city of Messina. Fourteen lecturers died under the ruins, while the majority of libraries and scientific facilities were destroyed. The University reopened in October 1909 starting with the Faculty of Law.\n\nDuring the years 1914-1915, the Faculty of Sciences, Pharmacy and Medicine reopened among outstanding difficulties.\n\nBetween 1919 and 1920 all the courses of the Faculty of Medicine were carried out thanks to the local institutions, which approved the establishment of a consortium managing the Civil Hospital where clinics had a temporary location.\n\nIn the same year, the University of Messina proved the recovery of its dynamism by regaining the title of Athenaeum of the Strait.\n\nYear by year, the Athenaeum strengthened its buildings and was playing a major role in cultural events of the country, overcoming also the difficult period of reconstruction after World War II, thanks to the Rectors Gaetano Martino and Salvatore Pugliatti.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2116117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116117", "title": "Heaton Moor", "text": "Heaton Moor\n\nHeaton Moor is a suburb of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. It is one of the Four Heatons and borders Heaton Chapel, Heaton Norris and Heaton Mersey. Heaton Moor has Victorian housing, built between 1852 and 1892 along tree-lined streets which follow the field patterns of a former agricultural economy.\n\nHeaton Moor is in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, mainly within the Heatons North ward. It was originally in the township of Heaton Norris, in the Salford hundred of Lancashire. Following the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act it was administered by Heaton Norris Local Board as part of the Stockport Poor Law Union. In 1913, Heaton Moor, as part of Heaton Norris, was absorbed into the County Borough of Stockport.\n\nThe land in Heaton Moor is predominantly flat with no rivers or streams. The soil is black and fertile as expected from land that was previously peat moor. Heaton Moor has little public open space with the exception of Heaton Moor Park and Thornfield Park, but because of its tree-lined roads and the building line set well back from the street, it gives the impression of having more space, and a Victorian business class style.\n\nToday the conservation area roads including Clifton Road and Mauldeth Road make up what is locally known as \"Millionaire's Row\".\n\nBefore the opening of the railway, Heaton Moor was agricultural land in Heaton Norris. The land supported pigs, cattle and cereal. Heaton Norris was part of the Manchester barony of the Grelley family, but between 1162 and 1180 it belonged to William le Norreys.\nIn the early 13th century, Heaton Norris was a sub manor of Manchester, it encompassed all of the Four Heatons. In 1322, there were 32 dwellings suggesting a population of 150, the ten freeholders of the escheated manor had the right to graze on common pasture and to cut wood. Evidence of this pre-railway existence can be seen from the name Shaw Farm, Shaw Fold farm, and the road pattern Heaton Moor Road, Shaw Road, Shaw Fold Lane, Pin Fold, Green Lane. Parsonage Road and Cranbourne Avenue follow the lines of ancient tracks.\n\nThe opening of Heaton Chapel railway station marked a turning point in development of the area. Land was acquired, and streets were planned. The houses and new buildings along Heaton Moor Road were of a grandiose scale with generous gardens. They are set back from the road, and have imposing stone gate posts. The new residential roads such as Broomfield Road, Derby Road, and Peel Moat Road which were built when agricultural land was acquired, have the same characteristics. The building and infilling continued into the Edwardian era. There were a wide range of sporting facilities, such as crown green bowling, tennis and golf. A substantial terrace of shops was built on Heaton Moor Road, with glass and cast iron awnings. Intellectual life was provided for when the Reform Club was built in 1886 by Alfred Darbyshire.\n\nThe Savoy Cinema opened 1923, built in the Baroque style in red brick with white terracota dressings. When in 2006 the cinema announced its closure due to low audiences, there was uproar amongst locals. It was announced it could be replaced by a Varsity bar. A Save Our Savoy campaign was launched. Plans for the bar were rejected. It has new owners, has been refurbished and reopened in 2015.\n\nA second hub was built around the former council offices in Thornfield Road, in the area known as Moor Top. The main thoroughfare is now home to wine bars, boutiques, florists and upmarket restaurants.\n\nMauldeth Hall is a large Greek Revival villa, built in 1832-60, for Joseph Chessborough Dyer; extended in 1880-82 by Charles Heathcote so that it could become a \"hospital for incurables\". After it became derelict in the late 20th century the hall was converted to offices; most of the park and gardens of the hall have been taken over by Heaton Moor Golf Club. On Mauldeth Road is a classical lodge (probably also by Heathcote). It has been a Grade II listed building since 1975.\n\nThe original owner was obliged to sell the hall in the early 1840s and it was acquired by Edmund Wright (1781-1852) as his residence. It was then named Leegate Hall but Wright renamed it Heaton Hall; since there was also a Heaton Hall at Prestwich he renamed it again as Mauldeth Hall. On the death of Edmund Wright in 1852 the hall was acquired by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners as the residence of the first Bishop of Manchester. The bishop was James Prince Lee, bishop since 1848, who lived in the hall until his death in 1869. In 1915 the Hospital for Incurables at Mauldeth Hall and Walmersley House had accommodation for 125 inpatients.\n\nAfter its restoration in the 1990's, the hall became the residence of the Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Manchester.\n\nTithe Barn Primary School, rated Outstanding by Ofsted, is located just over the border in Heaton Mersey. Heaton Moor is home to Charnwood Nursery, which provides inclusive education for children with and without Special Educational Needs, and is also rated Outstanding. The Heaton Secondary Special School is available for students with disabilities. The Heaton Moor campus of Stockport College was on Buckingham Road. This is now demolished and is being converted into new homes.\n\nThe district had for many years a boys' boarding school called Heaton Moor College. Boys mainly from the Middle East stayed in the main school building, a large detached Victorian villa house, on Heaton Moor Road. Its large rear garden harboured other classroom buildings as well as a playground. It was at its height in the early to mid 1950s. In 1953 there were 202 pupils and a teaching staff of 12. A block of flats now stands on the site. \n\n\nThe Manchester and Birmingham Railway Company built the line from Manchester to Crewe, the Manchester to Heaton Norris section opened in 1840. Heaton Chapel Station opened in 1852. Heaton Moor is built along Heaton Moor Road, a road leading from Reddish to Didsbury.\nVarious bus routes run through Heaton Moor including the 197 from Stockport to Manchester, the 25 from Stockport to Trafford Centre, and the 42A from Reddish to Manchester Piccadilly, along with various education buses. There is no designated taxi rank within Heaton Moor.\n\nHeaton Moor is affluent, and in the Victorian era had an equal residential status to Alderley Edge and Bowdon. Today, this moneyed reputation continues as the SK4 postcode is typically characterised by high disposable incomes. The estimated household weekly income for Heaton Moor in 2001 was significantly above the average for Greater Manchester.\n\nThe Heaton Moor Rugby Club has been representing the area in the Rugby fraternity for over 100 years. After a number of years of decline from near top level status pre league structures, a steady improvement in form in recent years has led to a re-emergence of the club in the local leagues. It has some of the best facilities in the region due to a unique sporting set up featuring Rugby, Cricket, Lacrosse and Tennis facilities in a multimillion-pound development.\n\nThe lacrosse team has been part of Heaton Moor since 1879, with Heaton Mersey Lacrosse club, going under the name Heaton Mersey, but playing in Heaton Moor on Green Lane at the Heatons Sports Club. \n\nWest Heaton Bowling, Tennis and Squash Club was established in 1873 and provides six all weather tennis courts (six floodlit), two squash courts and a bowling green.\n\nHeaton Moor Golf Club was founded in 1892 and is an 18-hole undulating parkland course.\n\nStuart Flinders from BBC North West Tonight is resident.\n\nDominic Monaghan, who played Merry in the film trilogy of \"The Lord of the Rings\" and Charlie Pace the television actor in Lost was born in Germany but raised here. The Stone Roses bass guitarist Gary Mounfield (Mani) lives here.\n\nManchester-born musician Norman Beaker, the ninth British blues artist to be inducted as Legend in the Blues Hall of Fame, has been a denizen of Heaton Moor since 1985.\n\nHeaton Moor was the birthplace of cricketer Charles Marriott\n\nTennis siblings Liam Broady and Naomi Broady and \nbasketball player John Amaechi are Heaton Moor residents.\n\nKate Richardson-Walsh, captain of Great Britain's 2016 gold medal winning hockey team, grew up in Heaton Moor, where she attended Tithe Barn School and Priestnall School.\n\nRonald Gow, dramatist, was born here.\n\nThe novelist, broadcaster and working Labour peer, Baroness Bakewell.\n\nThe crime author Val McDermid and TV screenwriter Danny Brocklehurst (Shameless, Sorted, Clocking Off) and children's author Philip Caveney live (or have recently lived) here. Children's author Jo Welch grew up in Heaton Moor and set her first book, \"The Einstein Code\", in the area.\n\nThe Guardian journalist and feminist Mary Stott and her husband lived here after moving from Leicester.\n\nCecil Kimber, the founder of MG Car Company lived in Heaton Moor, and was a pupil of Stockport Grammar School. \n\n\n"}

The pharaoh ant, whose origins are unknown, has now been introduced to virtually every area of the world, including Europe, the Americas, Australasia and Southeast Asia. It is a major pest in the United States, Australia, and Europe. \n\nThis species is polygynous, meaning each colony contains many queens, leading to unique caste interactions and colony dynamics. This also allows the colony to fragment into bud colonies quickly.\n\nPharaoh ants are a tropical species, but they thrive in buildings almost anywhere, even in temperate regions provided central heating is present.\n\nPharaoh workers are about 1.5 to 2 millimeters long, a little more than 1/16-inch. They are light yellow to reddish brown in color with a darker abdomen. Pharaoh ant workers have a non-functional stinger used to generate pheromones. The petiole (narrow waist between the thorax and abdomen) has two nodes and the thorax has no spines. Pharaoh ant eyesight is poor and they possess on average 32 ommatidia. The antennal segments end in a distinct club with three progressively longer segments. \n\nMales are about 3mm long, black, winged (but do not fly). Queens are dark red and 3.6–5mm long. They initially have wings that are lost soon after mating, but do not fly.\n\nThe pharaoh ant queen can lay hundreds of eggs in her lifetime. Most lay 10 to 12 eggs per batch in the early days of egg production and only four to seven eggs per batch later. At 27 °C (80 °F) and 80 percent relative humidity, eggs hatch in five to seven days. The larval period is 18 to 19 days, pre-pupal period three days and pupal period nine days. About four more days are required to produce sexual female and male forms. From egg to sexual maturity, it takes the pharaoh ant about 38 to 45 days, depending on temperature and relative humidity. They breed continuously throughout the year in heated buildings and mating occurs in the nest. Mature colonies contain several queens, winged males, workers, eggs, larvae, pre-pupae and pupae.\n\nEach colony produces sexually reproductive individuals roughly twice a year. However, colonies raised in a laboratory can be manipulated to produce sexuals at any time of year. Colonies proliferate by \"budding\" (also called \"satelliting\" or \"fractionating\"), where a subset of the colony including queens, workers and brood (eggs, larvae and pupae) leave the main colony for an alternative nest site.\n\nPharaoh ant colonies appear to prefer familiar nests to novel nests while budding. This suggests the ability for colonies to remember certain qualities of their living space. However, if the novel (unfamiliar) nest is of superior quality, the colony may initially move toward the familiar, but will eventually select the unfamiliar. The colony assumes the familiar nest is preferable, unless they sense better qualities in the novel nest. This decision-making process seeks to minimize the time the colony is without a nest while optimizing the nest the colony finally chooses.\nThe number of available budding locations has a large effect on colony fragmentation. A large number of bud nests results in small colony fragments, indicating that the colony has the ability to control size and caste ratios. However, a minimum group size of 469 individuals appears preferred by the species. Amount of fragmentation does not have an effect on food distribution. After budding, nest units do not compete for resources, but rather act cooperatively. This is evolutionarily explained by the high amount of genetic relatedness among these nest units. In addition, major disturbances to the central nest cause the colony to abandon it and flee to a bud nest. Thus, nest units may exchange individuals after budding occurs, further explaining their cooperative behavior.\n\nIn Australia, \"Monomorium\" species is particularly successful. This fact is particularly curious because of the presence of a very aggressive ant family, \"Iridomyrmex\", which is quite proficient at interference competition. \"Iridomyrmex\" ants are able to quickly seek out food sources and prevent other ant species from reaching them. However, unlike other ant species, \"Monomorium\" species, despite their unaggressive nature and small size, are able to thrive even in areas where \"Iridomyrmex\" dominates. This success can be attributed to their efficient foraging strategy, and their novel use of venom alkaloids, repellant chemical signals. With these two behaviors, \"Monomorium\" species can rapidly monopolize and defend food sources.\n\nPharaoh ants utilize 3 types of pheromones. One is a long-lasting attractive chemical that is used to build a trail network. It remains detectable even if the ants do not use the trail for several days. Pharaoh ants cease activity at night and begin each day of work at around 8 am, yet parts of the trail network are identical each day. The second pheromone is also attractive, but will decay to imperceptible amounts in a matter of minutes without reapplication. This pheromone is useful in marking food sources, as these are unpredictable and the colony must be able to respond to environmental changes quickly. Individuals will not waste their time on an unprofitable trail route. The third pheromone is a repellant. Pharaoh ants were the first species found to use a negative trail pheromone. If an individual finds an unprofitable area with little food or significant danger, it will release this repellant pheromone, which will warn others and cause them to look elsewhere. While positive pheromones indicating lucrative foraging sites are very common in social insects, the pharaoh ant's negative pheromone is highly unusual. Like the food source marker, the negative pheromone is volatile, decaying roughly two hours after being emitted. It may even be insecticidal in some cases. It is so powerful that an individual can detect it from away. Pharaoh ants utilize this pheromone near forks in the trail network, and an ant that detects it will begin to walk in a zigzag manner.\n\nBoth the attractive and repellent pheromones are utilized in the decision-making an ant must make while foraging. The repellent pheromone is especially useful in the repositioning of trails after a new food source has been introduced. It also helps prevent ants from concentrating on an undesirable trail. Thus, the repellant pheromone makes the pharaoh ant a particularly efficient forager. Despite their extreme importance, there is an adaptive value to using pheromones sparingly, as it streamlines communication during important decision-making situations, such as a nest migration.\n\nPharaoh ants use a positive feedback system of foraging. Each morning, scouts will search for food. When one finds it, it will instantly return to the nest. This causes several ants to follow the successful scout's trail back to the food source. Soon, a large group will be upon the food. Scouts are thought to use both chemical and visual cues to remain aware of the nest location and find their way. If the colony is exploring a new region, they employ a land rush tactic, in which a large number of foragers randomly search, constantly releasing pheromones.\n\nEven though \"M. pharaonis\" is most often thought an indoor pest, foraging has been found to be more prevalent outside. Even inside colonies were found to forage close to windows, indicating a propensity for outdoor environment.<ref name=\"Indoor/Outdoor\"></ref>\n\nEven though scouts search independently, they use a distinct trail system that remains somewhat constant from day to day. The system consists of one to four trunk routes. Every scout uses one of these trunks in the beginning and end of its food search. In this way, the trunks get continuous chemical reinforcement and do not change much. Each trunk divides into many branch routes. These will change based on food availability.\n\nThe organization of foraging trails is strongly affected by the health of the colony and the availability of food. Food deprivation induces a higher amount of foraging ant traffic, compared to a non-deprived population. If a food source is presented to the food deprived colony, this traffic was further increased, an indication of the pharaoh ant's recruitment tactic. If food is not present, a colony will extend its trails to a wider radius around the nest. Logically, number of trails and forager traffic is largest near a food source.\n\nWhile pheromones explain the pharaoh ant's foraging ability, each forager's capability to find its way back to the nest requires a different explanation. In fact, the pharaoh ant relies on geometry to show it the way home. Each fork in the trail system spreads at an angle between 50 and 60 degrees. When returning to the nest, a forager that encounters a fork will almost always take the path that deviates less from its current direction. In other words, it will never choose an acute angle that would drastically change its direction. Using this algorithm, each forager is able to find its way back to the nest. If the fork angle is experimentally increased to an angle between 60 and 120 degrees, \"M. pharaonis\" foragers were significantly less able to find their nest. This method of decision-making reduces the wasted energy that would result from traveling in the wrong direction and contributes to the pharaoh ant's efficiency in foraging.\n\nUpon scouts’ return with food, the queens will attempt to beg for their share. Depending on food availability and each individual's condition, a scout may refuse the queen's entreaties and even run away from her. The decision of an individual to give up food to the queen may be beneficial in situations of plentiful food, as a healthy queen can reproduce and propagate the colony's genes. However, when food is highly scarce, an individual's own survival can outweigh this potential benefit. She will therefore refuse to give up food.\n\nA queen may also feed on secretions from larvae. This creates a positive feedback loop in which more larvae will provide more food to queens who can in turn produce more larvae.\n\nIf a large amount of larvae results in a surplus of secretions, pharaoh ants will store the excess in the gasters of a unique caste, the replete workers. Members of this group have enormous gasters and can regurgitate their stored food when needed. In this way, the colony has a cushion against food shortages.\n\nPharaoh ants have a sophisticated strategy for food preference. They implement two related behaviors. The first is known as satiation. The workers will at first show a strong preference for a particular food type. However, if this food is offered alone, with no other options, for several weeks, workers will afterward show a distinct preference for a different type of food. In this way, the ants become satiated on a certain food group and will change their decision. The second behavior is called alternation. If given the continuous choice between food groups, pharaoh ants will tend to alternate between carbohydrate-rich foods and protein-rich foods. These satiation and alternation behaviors are evolutionarily adaptive. The decision to vary the type of food consumed ensures that the colony maintains a balanced diet.\n\n\"Monomorium pharaonis\", similar to other invasive ants, is polygynous, meaning its colonies contain many queens (up to 200). It is hypothesized that polygyny leads to lower levels of nestmate recognition in comparison to monogynous species due to the expected higher levels of genetic diversity. Because these colonies lack nestmate recognition, there is no hostility between neighbouring colonies, which is known as unicoloniality.\n\nMany invasive ants display unicoloniality. The adaptive value of this nonaggression among colonies has to do with avoiding unnecessary injury and allowing proper resource allocation, ensuring success for all the colonies. Low nestmate recognition, caused in part by polygyny, also has a biochemical basis in \"M. pharaonis\". Cuticular hydrocarbons are compounds, often found on antennae, that allow for communication in many social insects. In ant species, these compounds play an especially key role in nestmate recognition. Differences in cuticular hydrocarbons are detected by other ant species, who respond accordingly. However, all pharaoh ant colonies have the same hydrocarbons on their antennae. This leads to ineffective nestmate recognition, and nonaggression between colonies.\nPharaoh ant colonies contain many queens. The ratio of queens to workers is variable and dependent on the size of the colony. An individual colony normally contains 1,000–2,500 workers, but often a high density of nests gives the impression of massive colonies. In a small colony, there will be more queens relative to workers. In addition, individuals will be larger than those in a more populous colony. This ratio is controlled by the workers in the colony. Larvae that will produce workers have characteristic hairs all over them, while larvae that will produce sexual males or females are bare. It is thought that workers can use these distinguishing features to identify larvae. Workers may cannibalize larvae in order to ensure a favorable caste ratio. This decision to cannibalize is largely determined by the present caste ratio. If plenty of fertile queens are present, for example, the workers may eat sexual larvae. The caste ratios are controlled in an attempt to maximize the growth of the colony. For example, in a small colony, the ratio of queens to workers is increased. This in turn increases the potential for reproduction, allowing colony growth. Conversely, in a large colony, the high worker to queen ratio maximizes the foraging capacity of the nest, helping sustain the population size.\n\nThe Pharaoh ant is a polygynous species that has a relatively low worker to queen ratio of around 12.86. This allows the pharaoh ants to be able to exert social control over the size of the colony and the size of each caste. In the average nest, there are around 170 ± 8 queens every nest, which comprises around 5.2% of the total population, whereas there are around 2185 ± 49 workers, which make up around 66.6% of the population. This low worker to queen ratio is usually associated with swift changes in the nest and may be why pharaoh ants form many new nest buds quickly. To branch out and form a new bud nest, pharaoh ants need a minimum of 469 ± 28 individuals, which explains how they proliferate so quickly.\n\nMating for pharaoh ants occurs within the nests with males that are usually not from the colony which ensures genetic diversity. The queen can typically produce eggs in batches of 10 to 12 at once, but can lay up to 400 eggs every time she mates. The eggs that are produced take up to 42 days to mature from an egg to an adult. Each queen within the nest lives between 4 and 12 months.\n\nDuring copulation, sperm is transferred from male to female inside a spermatophore. There are several theories regarding the adaptive value of using a spermatophore. It contains certain chemicals that may inhibit the female's sex drive. Alternatively, it may physically plug the female's gonophore. In either explanation, the spermatophore prevents the female from reproducing with another male. In essence, the use of a spermatophore is evolutionarily favorable because it increases the probability of the male's genetic code being transferred to subsequent generations by lessening potential competition from other males.\n\nPharaoh ant copulation, like that of many social insects, is harmful to the female. The penis valve contains sharp teeth, which latch onto a thick, soft cuticular layer in the female. This method of copulation too has an evolutionary basis. The teeth ensure sex lasts long enough for sufficient sperm transfer. Also, the pain caused to the female may, in some ways, lessen her desire to mate again.\n\nWhen the queen ant first moves to a new nest, she will rear the first group of workers. Once a worker threshold has been reached, resources will then be invested into new males and queens. When a new nest is formed, queens are not a necessity; workers can raise new queens after finding a suitable nest site.\n\nIn pharaoh ant colonies new males and queen ants can be produced when the existing fertile queen is removed. When queens are absent, the workers in the nest can do two things: either rear existing sexual larvae or transport sexual larvae from other bud nests or from the main nest to its own nest. However, when there are fertile queens still within the nest, the worker ants will cannibalize the sexual larvae and will either reject or consume sexual larvae from other nests. On the other hand, the worker ants will always accept and nurture worker larvae from other nests. Furthermore, according to Schmidt et al., polygamous species such as pharaoh ants will have higher resource allocations towards the female caste instead of the worker caste to ensure rapid growth of new budding colonies.\n\nWhen social ants encounter ants from another colony, behavior can be either aggressive or non-aggressive. Aggressive behavior is very commonly seen; the attacking worker usually bites the opponent at the petiole. In non-aggressive behavior, antennation occurs when the two ants meet. In the case of \"Monomorium pharaonis\", behavior is almost always non-aggressive even when the ants are from different colonies and of different castes. Very few cases exist where aggressive behavior is seen in these ants.\n\nAfter foraging, pharaoh ants will wash themselves when a worker enters the cell. Pharaoh ants will also wash after a long feed. It has been proposed that washing has a hygienic value, keeping the nest area clean, staving off disease and disorder. Right before workers leave to forage, they also may wash themselves. However, in this instance the behavior is extremely violent, often causing the ants to fall over. It is thought that here, the washing behavior has no hygienic value and instead may be a displacement activity, a sign that the ants are deliberating whether or not to exit the nest.\n\nBudding is a major factor underlying the invasiveness of pharaoh ants. A single seed colony can populate a large office block, almost to the exclusion of all other insect pests, in less than six months. Elimination and control are difficult because multiple colonies can consolidate into smaller colonies during extermination programs only to repopulate later.\n\nPharaoh ants have become a serious pest in almost every type of building. They can feed on a wide variety of foods including grease, sugary foods, and dead insects. They can also gnaw holes in silk, rayon and rubber goods. Nests can be very small, making detection even more difficult. They are usually found in wall voids, under floors, or in various types of furniture. In homes, they are often found foraging in bathrooms or near food.\n\nIt is recommended not to attempt extermination using insecticidal sprays and dusts because they will cause the pharaoh ants to scatter and colonies to split, although non-repellent residual insecticides have been reported to be effective.\n\nThe recommended method to eliminate pharaoh ants is by the use of baits attractive to the species. Modern baits use insect growth regulators (IGRs) as the active substance; the ants are attracted to the bait by its food content, and take it back to the nest. Over a period of weeks the IGR prevents the production of worker ants and sterilizes the queen. Renewing the baits once or twice may be necessary.\n\nPharaoh and other ants have also been exterminated with baits of 1% boric acid and sugar water.\n\n\n"}

It is currently based on Kew, and also includes Balwyn, Canterbury, Deepdene, Hawthorn, Mont Albert and Mont Albert North; and parts of Camberwell, Glen Iris, Hawthorn East and Surrey Hills.\n\nSince the 2010 election, Josh Frydenberg, Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party since 2018, has been the member for the Division, following the retirement of Petro Georgiou.\n\nThe Division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first Federal election.\n\nKooyong has been held by the Liberal Party of Australia and its predecessors for its entire existence. It is one of two original electorates in Victoria to have never been won by the Australian Labor Party, the other being Gippsland. For decades, it has been one of the safest Coalition seats in metropolitan Australia. For example, even during Labor's landslide victory in 1943, Menzies still won comfortably with 62.5 percent of the two-party vote.\n\nThe seat's best-known member was Sir Robert Menzies, the longest-serving Prime Minister of Australia. From 1922 to 1994, it was held by only three members, all of whom went on to lead the non-Labor forces in Parliament — former Opposition Leader and future Chief Justice John Latham, Menzies, and former Opposition Leader Andrew Peacock.\n\nPeacock's successor, high-profile Liberal backbencher Petro Georgiou, saw off a challenge from Josh Frydenberg for Liberal Party preselection in April 2006. On 22 November 2008, Georgiou announced his retirement at the next federal election. Frydenberg won preselection as the Liberal Party's candidate for the seat for the 2010 election, and won despite a small swing against him.\n\nIn 2019, high-profile Greens candidate Julian Burnside received the highest two-party preferred vote against the Liberals or their predecessors in 90 years, at 44.3%. The Liberals had anticipated a strong contest and doubled their campaign funding to Kooyong earlier in the year, raising their initial cost of $500,000 to $1 million in campaigning. Frydenberg retained the seat, despite suffering a significant negative swing of 8.81% and the Liberal Party receiving its lowest first preference vote in the electorate in 76 years. It was also only the second time in 76 years that the major non-Labor party didn't win the seat outright on the first count. The swing was actually large enough to drop the Liberal margin in a \"traditional\" two-party contest with Labor to 6.8 percent, the closest margin between the parties in decades.\nThe Division is named after the suburb of Kooyong, on which it was originally based. However, the suburb of Kooyong has not been in its namesake electorate for some time, being instead in neighbouring Higgins. Nonetheless, the seat has retained the name of Kooyong, primarily because the Australian Electoral Commission's guidelines on electoral redistributions require it to preserve the names of original electorates where possible.\n\n"}

The leaves are long and broad, pinnate, with 11-15 leaflets. The flowers are bicoloured red and yellow, long, produced in racemes long. The fruit is a cylindrical pod long and diameter, the interior divided by a spongy substance into one to five cells, each of which contains a large chestnut-like seed.\n\nThe 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia' records the common names of \"Castanospermum australe\" as \"Moreton Bay Chestnut\" and \"Bean tree\" and notes that it was called \"Irtalie\" by Aboriginal people of the Richmond and Clarence Rivers (New South Wales) and \"Bogum\" by \"others of Northern New South Wales\". Other names that have been used by Aboriginal peoples are: baway, yiwurra, junggurraa, mirrayn, ganyjuu, and binyjaalga.\n\nIn 1981, castanospermine was isolated from the seeds. Members of this genus accumulate iminosugars in their leaves.\n\nDue to its importance as a food, the blackbean tree was a seasonal gathering point for Aboriginal peoples, and this acted as a catalyst for ceremonies. Songlines featuring the black bean seeds have been collected. The bark fibre has been used for fish and animal traps, nets and baskets, and the empty seed pods have been used as toy boats. Additionally, the tree has been used as a seasonal signal for when to hunt jungle fowl.\n\nThe seeds are poisonous, and can cause vomiting and diarrhoea, but become edible when carefully prepared by roasting, cutting up into small pieces, leaching with running water for several days, and pounding into flour and roasting it as a damper. The seeds have been prepared and eaten for at least 2,500 years. The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia' notes and describes this use of the beans. As of 2012, the food was not used in modern bush tucker, and there was no nutritional information available on the seeds.\n\nThe trees are popular as potted plants in Asia, Europe and America. In addition, they have been used as shade trees in landscaping for parks.\n\nThe wood was used by Aboriginal people for spear throwers. The timber, which somewhat resembles walnut, is soft, fine-grained, and takes a good polish, and the wood has a durability rating above-ground of over 40 years longevity.\n\nDue to its significance as a food for Aboriginal people, blackbean trees were spread by hand into mountain areas on the east coast of Australia. All the trees in New South Wales are descended from a single seed. The plant naturally spreads by water. It has been introduced to India, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, South Africa and the United States of America.\n\n"}

It was created by Lieutenant Jock Lewes, one of the original members of L Detachment SAS in 1941. The SAS needed a combined incendiary and explosive device light enough to be carried by a small group of commandos yet powerful enough to destroy and set fire to aircraft on an enemy airfield. Weighing approximately , the Lewes bomb could be carried in quantity by an individual.\n\nThe only available bomb at the time was too cumbersome to be carried by a paratrooper. Lewes experimented with various types of incendiary and explosive materials, using trial and error. The final design used a pound of plastic explosive, mixed with a quarter pound of thermite and a small amount of diesel oil and steel filings. Inside the mass was inserted a two-ounce dry guncotton booster, plus a detonator attached to a thirty seconds fuse. Alternatively, Lewes bombs could be triggered by pencil detonators or booby-trap firing devices such as pressure release switches.\nIt is not clear what was used as a container for the explosive, though it was probably a small canvas bag of some sort. In use, the device was placed inside the cockpit or on the wing of an aircraft in order to ignite the aviation fuel stored within.\n\nA disadvantage of the Lewes bomb was that the detonators could be unreliable; several raids failed when their pencil-detonators were rendered unusable by heavy rain. The timing of the detonators could also be affected by the desert heat; after a raid in December 1941 one party reported the 30 minute time pencils had detonated in just 18 minutes due to the warmth of the night.\n\nIn the hands of the SAS the Lewes bomb was an effective weapon against parked aircraft; following an attack in December 1941, an assessment was carried out by a group of Italian engineers on some unexploded bombs found on aircraft at their airfield. After repairing the fuses, they placed the bombs \"with school-boy enthusiasm\" on some old aircraft, exactly as they had been found. The result, they reported, was that \"in every case the firing of the charge, besides causing considerable damage due to the explosion, set the fuel alight... causing complete destruction of the vehicle\". However they also noted that the fires did not \"seem to have been due to any particular qualities of the explosive, but to the accurate placing of the charges in proximity to the fuel tanks\" \n\n"}
{"id": "2116227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116227", "title": "Wolfstone", "text": "Wolfstone\n\nWolfstone are a Scottish musical group founded in 1989, who play Celtic rock. Their repertoire consists of both original songs and traditional folk pieces. To date, they have released seven studio albums, the latest, \"Terra Firma\", in 2007. The band record on their own label, Once Bitten Records. The group are named after the \"Wolfstone\", a Pictish stone originally sited at Ardross, Easter Ross, close to where the band initially recorded.\n\nThe roots of Wolfstone go back to when fiddler Duncan Chisholm met guitarist Stuart Eaglesham at a pub session. An idea becoming realised, Stuart's brother and keyboard player, Struan Eaglesham, was offered a place in the line-up, as was piper Allan Wilson from Bonar Bridge. Roger Niven from the Black Isle played guitar, but was soon replaced by Andy Murray. In 1989, Wolfstone performed their opening show at the first Highland Traditional Music Festival in Dingwall, supplemented by sequenced bass and drums. Following this, the band ran the usual Highlands and Islands village dance hall circuit, gaining live experience. It was clear that this was a worthwhile venture, the gigs earning them more than their day jobs. During this period, Wolfstone recorded two albums - \"Wolfstone\" and \"Wolfstone II\" respectively - on Rowan Records, utilising sequencing machines over a standard rhythm section. These albums were produced by David Foster, who also contributed vocals to some of the tracks. However, he parted ways with Wolfstone in 1990 over disagreement on the band's direction. Also in 1990, Orcadian Ivan Drever joined the band on vocals, guitars, and songwriting duties. Soon, Wolfstone were offered a recording contract with Iona Records in Glasgow, and in 1991, began work on \"Unleashed\", allowing them to guest drummer John Henderson and bassist Neil Hay for a decidedly more authentic sound. Mid-process, they were offered a support slot at Runrig's major Loch Lomond Midsummer event, alongside such acts as Capercaillie and Hothouse Flowers. This exposure brought the band larger gigs and shows, playing to new audiences. Ultimately, \"Unleashed\" was a success, achieving silver status in the UK.\n\n1992 saw Wolfstone enter the studio once again to record their follow-up album, \"The Chase\". By this time, piper Allan Wilson had left the band, and his position was filled for several years by a string of different session musicians, including Dougie Pincock, Gordon Duncan and Martyn Bennett. \"The Chase\" proved a great success, achieving gold status. The band were once again made busy touring, with the addition of TV appearances, for example the 1993 edition of Children in Need. An EP entitled \"Burning Horizons\" was released in 1993, consolidating bassist Wayne Mackenzie and drummer Mop Youngson as full-time members. In 1994, Wolfstone signed to Green Linnet Records, which consequently saw the release of \"Year of the Dog\". With the backing of a major label, the band was now able to reach a truly international audience, touring Europe, America and even reaching countries such as Kazakhstan. About this time, the Celtic Records label reissued the band's early albums, \"Wolfstone\" and \"Wolfstone II\". There is no clear reason as to why this was undertaken. With the albums' inclusion of a synthesised rhythm section, their quality is vastly inferior to that of a standard recording. Duncan Chisholm says: \"We disown those two albums. The band we are in does not reflect what was going on then; a different line up with different ideas and objectives; anyone buying those two albums is not buying a Wolfstone recording. We would never promote them and we certainly wouldn't sell them to anyone.\" Despite this, the first of these albums received a positive reception from Allmusic. In late 1994, the position of piper was finally consolidated when Stevie Saint joined the band full-time. He has remained in the line-up ever since. In 1996, Wolfstone released their fourth album, \"The Half Tail\". As with previous albums, it met with success, though some critics felt it lacked the band's usual drive.\n\nMop Youngson left the band in late 1996 owing to exhaustion derived from constant touring. He was replaced by session drummer Ronny Watson. Keyboard player Struan Eaglesham also left the band at this time. He was replaced by Andy Thorburn. Wolfstone continued to tour in 1997–1998 following the release of their \"Half Tail\" album. In 1997, a best-of compilation album, assembled by the band's former label Iona Records, was released in partnership with Green Linnet. However, to fulfill part of the recording contract with Green Linnet Records, Ivan Drever undertook a side project involving a few band members, entitled \"This Strange Place\". Green Linnet deliberately marketed this as a Wolfstone album, perhaps to achieve greater sales. As such, the band's popularity waned, as fans were led to believe that the album's largely mellow sound was Wolfstone's new direction. Drever's departure in late 1998 again struck at the band's popularity, as many felt he had been their stylistic backbone. Technically, Wolfstone were disbanded towards the end of 1998, but the band were obliged to return to the studio to fulfill their recording contract. Joined by Andy Simmers on keys, and Tony Soave on drums, they recorded in the winter of 1998/1999, producing \"Seven\". Wolfstone regard this 'comeback album' a success, having been pleased with the final outcome. They toured for the majority of 2000, but were struck by tragedy at the death of Andy Simmers. The band made the decision to continue, and also set up their own label, namely Once Bitten Records. On this, the band released their first and so far only live album \"Not Enough Shouting\".\n\nIn 2002, Wolfstone returned to the fold to record another album, which had an altogether rockier feel. This was \"Almost an Island\". Sometime after this, the band experienced a brief hiatus to allow members to relax from the strains of touring. Alyn Cosker, session drummer on the album, joined the band full-time, whilst long-time bassist Wayne Mackenzie left the group. In 2003, Ross Hamilton joined Wolfstone on various guitar duties, but eventually began to share vocals with Stuart Eaglesham. 2004 saw the band reach America once again, playing at a variety of festivals. The intervening years saw Dundonian Colin Cunningham join the band on bass guitar. In early 2007, Wolfstone released \"Terra Firma\" with a launch party at the Ironworks venue in Inverness, with Ross Hamilton assuming full vocal duties on the album. However, he departed just a few months after this. This meant that by the time Wolfstone supported Runrig at their 'Beat the Drum' concert at Drumnadrochit on the banks of Loch Ness, Stuart Eaglesham had returned to lead vocals. Later that year, Davie Dunsmuir joined the band as lead guitarist. In 2010, the band celebrated their 21st anniversary at the Festival Theatre in Pitlochry. 2011 saw further touring across Europe, and an overhaul of the official website. Stuart Eaglesham released a video interview in July, which stated that Wolfstone were in the studio recording new tracks. The band hoped to release an EP or full album late 2011 or early 2012, eventually an EP was released in March 2012 containing two tracks.\n\nWolfstone perform pieces from the traditional folk and Celtic repertoire permeated with rock and roll sensibilities. This was perhaps most obvious on the early \"Wolfstone\" and \"Wolfstone II\" albums which featured prominent walking bass-lines. As well as this, the band is also a source of both original tunes and songs. Previous material stemmed, though not exclusively, from collaborations between Ivan Drever and Duncan Chisholm, as well as Drever's own compositions. Only more recently have Duncan Chisholm and Stuart Eaglesham written songs together. Wolfstone's songs vary greatly in subject matter. They explore emigration and displacement (\"Burning Horizons\", \"Braes of Sutherland\"), social injustice (\"Close It Down\", \"Brave Foot Soldiers\") and conflict (\"White Gown\", \"Brave Boys\"), amongst other things. They have also recorded several traditional songs which happen to work well in a rock setting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was Tudor who christened Boston \"The Athens of America\" in an 1819 letter. His brother Frederic Tudor founded the Tudor Ice Company and became Boston's \"Ice King\", shipping ice to the tropics from many local sources of fresh water including Walden Pond, Fresh Pond, and Spy Pond in Arlington, Massachusetts.\n\nTudor was the oldest child of William Tudor and Delia Jarvis Tudor. He graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard College in 1796. Tudor's travels to Europe polished his civility, and it is said that he held George III's interest in conversation long enough to bring complaints from the lord in waiting, who had others to present. Tudor wrote home to his mother from Paris in 1799, at age 20, that he was sending:\n\nOne of his visitors in 1782, the young Marquis de Chastellux, has left a record; he was delighted to find that Mrs. Tudor had arranged a program of French songs, to be sung by a young nephew of the admiral to the accompaniment of his harp. \"I thought myself in heaven, or which is the same thing, I thought myself returned to my country.\"\n\nTudor was a member of the Massachusetts Historical Society and served as United States Consul in Peru from March 27, 1824 until May 15, 1827, and as Chargé d'Affaires at Rio de Janeiro from his appointment on June 26, 1827 until his death by fever there on March 9, 1830. His tomb was rediscovered by Charles Lyon Chandler in 1944.\n\nTudor was indirectly involved in the first railroad in the United States, created to carry granite for the construction of the Bunker Hill Monument. George Ticknor, a well-known lawyer and antiquarian, first suggested the memorial and an interested group of men met for breakfast at the home of Colonel Thomas Handasyd Perkins. Among them were Tudor, Daniel Webster, Professor George Ticknor, Doctor John C. Warren, William Sullivan, and George Blake. On May 10, 1823, the first public meeting was called. Work proceeded somewhat slowly, but on January 4, 1826, citizens petitioned the Massachusetts legislature to build a Railroad, which was then completed in short order and became operational on October 9, 1826 as the first railroad in the United States.\n\nTudor was co-founder and first editor of the famous \"North American Review\", and cofounder of the \"Monthly Anthology\", founded by Phineas Adams and then published from 1803-1811 as the vehicle of the Anthology Club whose members included Tudor, George Ticknor, Dr. Bigelow and Rev. J. S. J. Gardiner, Alexander H. Everett, and Rev. Messrs. Buckminster, Thacher, and the Rev. William Emerson (father of Ralph Waldo Emerson).\n\nHis chief literary works were the \"Miscellanies\" (1821), a collection of essays written for the \"Monthly Anthology\" and the \"North American Review\", on subjects ranging from the \"Secret Causes of the American and French Revolutions\" to human misery, purring cats, and cranberry sauce; \"The Life of James Otis of Massachusetts\" (1823), generally considered Tudor's best work; and \"Gebel Teir\" (1829), an anonymous satire on international politics in which a council of birds, representing the United States, Spain, England, France, and the Elysian Fields, gathers to discuss politics.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2116282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116282", "title": "Kopi tiam", "text": "Kopi tiam\n\nA kopitiam or kopi tiam is a traditional coffee shop mostly found in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Southern Thailand patronised for meals and beverages. The word \"kopi\" is an Indonesian and Malay term for \"coffee\" and \"tiam\" is the Hokkien/Hakka term for \"shop\" (). Menus typically feature simple offerings: a variety of foods based on egg, toast, and kaya, plus coffee, tea, and Milo.\n\nIn Malaysia, as in Singapore, kopitiams are found almost everywhere. However, there are a few differences. In Malaysia:\n\nRecently a new breed of \"modern\" kopitiams have sprung up. The popularity of the old-fashioned outlets along with society's obsession with nostalgia and increasing affluence has led to the revival of these pseudo-kopitiams. The new kopitiams are fast-food outlets which are reminiscent of the old kopitiams in terms of decor, but are usually built in a more modern, hygienic setting such as a shopping mall rather than in the traditional shophouse, catering mainly for young adults.\n\nTo offer the true kopitiam experience, modern kopitiams mostly offer authentic local coffee brews, charcoal grilled toast served with butter and kaya (a local version of jam made from coconut milk and eggs) and soft-boiled eggs. Some have extended menus where local breakfast, lunch and dinner meals are served. To tap into the sizeable Muslim market, these kopitiams usually serve food that is halal (permissible for consumption by Muslims) unlike the traditional shophouse kopitiams.\n\nToday there are no less than 100 brand names of modern kopitiams operating in various parts of Malaysia.\n\nKopitiams in Ipoh oldtown district serve Ipoh white coffee. The coffee beans are roasted with palm-oil margarine and with less sugar, resulting in a brew that is lighter in colour than normal coffee beans that uses sugar – hence the name 'white coffee'.\n\"Kopi tiam\"s in Singapore are commonly found in almost all residential areas as well as some industrial and business districts in the country, numbering about 2,000 in total. Although most are an aggregate of small stalls or shops, some may be more reminiscent of food courts, although each stall has similar appearance and the same style of signage.\nIn a typical kopi tiam, the drinks stall is usually run by the owner who sells coffee, tea, soft drinks, and other beverages as well as breakfast items like kaya toast, soft-boiled eggs and snacks. The other stalls are leased by the owner to independent stallholders who prepare a variety of food dishes, often featuring the cuisine of Singapore. Traditional dishes from different ethnicities are usually available at kopitiams so that people from different ethnic backgrounds and having different dietary habits could dine in a common place and even at a common table.\n\n\"Kopitiam\" is also the name of a food court chain in Singapore.\n\nSome of the popular kopi tiams in Singapore include Kim San Leng, Killiney & Tong Ah Eating House or Ya Kun Kaya Toast\n\nSome of the more common foods that can be seen in kopi tiams, besides the ever-popular eggs and toast, consist of char kway tiao (fried flat rice noodles (hor fun), sometimes cooked with eggs and cockles), Hokkien mee (yellow wheat noodles served with various seafood as well as egg) and, possibly the most common, nasi lemak, or coconut rice (a Malay dish of coconut-flavoured rice, served with sambal chilli paste, egg, and fried anchovies).\nAt kopi tiams (), coffee and tea are usually ordered using a specific vernacular featuring terms from different languages. Kopi (coffee) was created when Singapore started its development and had to cater to the needs of the European population - specifically their love for coffee. \"Kopi\" (coffee) and \"teh\" (tea) can be tailored to suit the drinker's taste by using the following suffixes when ordering:\n\nThese are typically chained together to customize a drink order: a \"kopi si kosong\" will result in a coffee with evaporated milk and no sugar.\n\n\"Coffee shop talk\" is a phrase used to describe gossip because it is often a familiar sight at kopi tiams where a group of workers or senior citizens would linger over cups of coffee and exchange news and comments on various topics including national politics, office politics, TV dramas, sports and food.\n\n\n\nThese terms may be used in different configurations to suit one's liking.\n\n"}
{"id": "2116290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116290", "title": "Hirwaun", "text": "Hirwaun\n\nHirwaun (Welsh \"Long Meadow\") is a village and community at the north end of the Cynon Valley in the County Borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, South Wales. It is NW of the town of Aberdare, and comes under the Aberdare post town. At the 2001 census, Hirwaun had a population of 4,851. increasing at the 2011 census to 4,990. The village is on the Heads of the Valleys Road and at the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons National Park.\n\nHirwaun has an industrial background centred around the Hirwaun Ironworks. After the ironworks closed, coal mining continued, and was a major employer until the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe Crawshay family were powerful, almost all-powerful in the production of steel, and the Hirwaun Ironworks had produced cannons used on HMS Victory. The family owned a large portion of Hirwaun and even used their own currency, the \"Hirwaun Guinea\", to pay employees, a form of truck system which stopped employees travelling to Cardiff or spending their money outside the controlled economy of the village.\n\nFollowing the miners' strike, the only deep coal mine left in Wales was Tower Colliery, which closed down, was bought by its workers and reopened.\n\nAnthony Bacon started iron production at Cyfarthfa in 1765. His business partner, Francis Homfray, ran the works during the Napoleonic Wars. The finished product was transported to the port of Cardiff by mules and pack-horses. The works later passed through a succession of owners before being purchased in 1819 by William Crawshay of Cyfarthfa. Crawshay expanded the works, leading to a population influx into the locality. By 1830, nearly 900 men were employed at the Hirwaun works, and in the same year the first railway steam engine seen in the locality began to operate from the works. The ironworks remained in family hands until its closure in 1859. The ironworks' blast furnaces required coke, which spurred an increase in local coal mining.\n\nHirwaun had its own seat on Glamorgan County Council from 1889. The first member elected was Sir William Thomas Lewis, later Lord Merthyr. Hirwaun was also part of the Aberdare Urban District Council area.\n\nSaint Lleurwg's parish church is in the centre of the village, in the ecclesiastical parish of Hirwaun. It was opened by Alfred Ollivant, Bishop of Llandaff in July 1858. The sister church in the parish, in Penywaun, is dedicated to Saint Winefred.\n\nThere were a number of nonconformist chapels in Hirwaun village, most dating from its early days as an industrial settlement when large numbers of people arrived from rural Wales. The chapels included Ramoth (Baptist), Nebo (Congregationalist) and Soar (Wesleyan Methodist).\n\nDuring the 1904-05 Religious Revival, Evan Roberts, the main instigator of the movement, visited the village.\n\nUnlike most South Wales Coalfield villages, Hirwaun has an array of different architectural housing styles, often cheek-by-jowl in small blocks. This is due to developments to satisfy different needs at different times, with much gentrification in the last few decades. So Hirwaun has a discontinuous, hotch-potch feel to it that marks it out as unusual in the South Wales Valleys.\n\nHirwaun made local news in May 2004 when its two 1960s-built tower blocks were demolished by dynamite detonation. Their demise marked the end of a major landmark in the Cynon Valley and was symptomatic of a broader failure in the design of British public housing.\n\nCurrently the patch of green land known as Hirwaun Common is being strip mined again. This was first done in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThe village was originally served by Hirwaun railway station on the Vale of Neath Railway, which arrived in 1851. At Gwelli Junction north of the station, the mainline from to met the Vale of Neath Railway branch to and the Aberdare Railway. South of the station were the goods yard and sidings which served the various industries in the area, including Hirwaun Ironworks, Tower Colliery, two brickworks, and Penderyn quarry tramway.\n\nWith the Beeching Axe in 1963, the lines south to Neath and north to Merthyr and the former Aberdare Railway were all closed. Hirwaun station was demolished. The line north to Aberdare on the Merthyr Line to was only kept open for coal traffic to Tower Colliery, which moved its coal washery and loading facility onto the site of the former station goods yard.\n\nAfter the second closure of Tower in early 2008, in November 2009 the Welsh Assembly Government (WAG) asked Network Rail to conduct a feasibility study on reopening the line to Hirwaun for passenger services. After clearing the line of vegetation, Network Rail submitted its report to WAG. Currently, no decision has been made as to whether the line from Hirwaun to Aberdare will reopen.

The facility is the main venue of downtown Youngstown's DeYor Performing Arts Center. The complex also includes the Adler Art Academy, Beecher Flad Pavilion, and Ford Family Recital Hall. Originally built in 1931 as the Warner Theatre, the former movie palace was renovated and reopened as Powers Auditorium in 1969.\n\nThe main tenant of Powers Auditorium is the Youngstown Symphony, which performs from October through May. The facility also hosts other musical acts, touring Broadway productions, and locally produced theater (primarily from Ballet Western Reserve and Easy Street Productions, two Youngstown-based theater companies).\n\nDesigned by the prominent theater architects Rapp and Rapp, Powers opened as the Warner Theatre on May 14, 1931, part of the massive chain of theaters operated by the Warner Brothers film company. The structure was built as a memorial to the late Sam Warner, who along with his brothers, resided in Youngstown before embarking on a career in film production. The Warner Theatre operated until 1968, when it was scheduled to be demolished to make way for a parking lot. A public outcry prompted the Edward W. Powers family to donate $250,000 to preserve the structure. The theater was preserved and renovated in 1969. Many items in the theater were auctioned off, and the auditorium underwent extensive acoustical renovation in order to make it a suitable concert hall. In September of that year, the building was re-christened as Powers Auditorium with a performance by the Youngstown Symphony.\n\nPowers Auditorium can hold a capacity crowd of 2,303. An impressive remnant of the golden age of cinema, the former movie theater is included on the National Register of Historic Places. In recent years, the structure's Art Deco facade was restored to its original appearance. Meanwhile, the building continues to be expanded.\n\nIn 2000, a new East Wing was completed, giving the Symphony a music library and administrative office, as well as an elevator and equipment that brought Powers up to standard in handicap accessibility. Recently completed is the Beecher Flad Pavilion, which comprises the Ford Recital Hall, a 600-seat auditorium for orchestra, brass, and choral performances; new kitchen facilities; new dressing rooms; expanded loading docks; and soundproofing so that Powers and the new auditorium can be used simultaneously.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2116304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116304", "title": "Gross fixed capital formation", "text": "Gross fixed capital formation\n\nGross fixed capital formation (GFCF) is a macroeconomic concept used in official national accounts such as the United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA), National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) and the European System of Accounts (ESA). The concept dates back to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) studies of Simon Kuznets of capital formation in the 1930s, and standard measures for it were adopted in the 1950s. Statistically it measures the value of acquisitions of new or existing fixed assets by the business sector, governments and \"pure\" households (excluding their unincorporated enterprises) \"less\" disposals of fixed assets. GFCF is a component of the expenditure on gross domestic product (GDP), and thus shows something about how much of the new value added in the economy is invested rather than consumed.\n\nGFCF is called \"gross\" because the measure does not make any adjustments to deduct the consumption of fixed capital (depreciation of fixed assets) from the investment figures. For the analysis of the development of the productive capital stock, it is important to measure the value of the acquisitions less disposals of fixed assets beyond replacement for obsolescence of existing assets due to normal wear and tear. \"\"Net fixed investment\"\" includes the depreciation of existing assets from the figures for new fixed investment, and is called \"net fixed capital formation\".\n\nGFCF is \"not\" a measure of \"total\" investment, because only the value of net additions to fixed assets is measured, and all kinds of \"financial\" assets are excluded, as well as stocks of inventories and other operating costs (the latter included in intermediate consumption). If, for example, one examines a company balance sheet, it is easy to see that fixed assets are only one component of the total annual capital outlay.\n\nThe most important exclusion from GFCF is \"land sales and purchases\". The original reason, leaving aside complex valuation problems involved in estimating the value of land in a standard way, was that if a piece of land is sold, the total amount of land already in existence, is not regarded as being increased thereby; all that happens is that the \"ownership\" of the same land changes. Therefore, only the value of land improvement is included in the GFCF measure as a net addition to wealth. In special cases, such as land reclamation from the sea, a river or a lake (e.g. a polder), new land can indeed be created and sold where it did not exist before, adding to fixed assets. The GFCF measure always applies to the resident enterprises of a national territory, and thus if e.g. oil exploration occurs in the open seas, the associated new fixed investment is allocated to the national territory in which the relevant enterprises are resident. \nData is usually provided by statistical agencies annually and quarterly, but only within a certain time-lag. Fluctuations in this indicator are often considered to show something about future business activity, business confidence and the pattern of economic growth. In times of economic uncertainty or recession, typically business investment in fixed assets will be reduced, since it ties up additional capital for a longer interval of time, with a risk that it will not pay itself off (and fixed assets may therefore also be scrapped faster). Conversely, in times of robust economic growth, fixed investment will increase across the board, because the observed market expansion makes it likely that such investment will be profitable in the future. This is the cross value end of the year of an country.\n\nDetailed standard definitions of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) are provided by the United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA) and the IMF Balance of Payments system. The definitions used by the US Bureau for Economic Analysis for the National Income & Product Accounts (NIPA's) and in the European System of Accounts (ESA) are very similar.\n\nGFCF is a flow value. It is measured by the total value of a producer's acquisitions, less disposals of fixed assets during the accounting period plus certain additions to the value of non-produced assets (such as subsoil assets or major improvements in the quantity, quality or productivity of land) realised by the productive activity of institutional units. In this way GFCF is a measure of \"gross net investment\" (acquisitions less disposals) in fixed capital assets by enterprises, government and households within the domestic economy, during an accounting period such as a quarter or a year:\n\nIt is worth noting that fixed assets in national accounts have a broader coverage than fixed assets in business accounts. Fixed assets are produced assets that are used repeatedly or continuously in production processes for more than one year. The stock of produced fixed assets consists of tangible assets (\"e.g. residential and non-residential building, roads, bridges, airports, railway, machinery, transport equipment, office equipment, vineyards and orchards, breeding livestock, dairy livestock, draught animals, sheep and other animals reared for their wool\"). The European System of Accounts (ESA95) explicitly includes produced intangible assets (e.g. mineral exploration, computer software, copyright protected entertainment, literary and artistics originals) within the definition of fixed assets.\n\nThe range of fixed assets included in statistical measurement is defined by the purpose in using them. A vehicle for example is a fixed asset, but vehicles are included in GFCF only if they are actually used in work activities, i.e. if they fall within the scope of \"production\". A car for personal use only is not normally included. The boundaries are not always easy to define however, since vehicles may be used both for personal purposes and for work purposes; a conventional rule is usually applied in that case.\n\nNon-produced assets (\"e.g. land except the value of land improvements, subsoil assets, mineral reserves, natural resources such as water, primary forests\") are excluded from the official measure of GFCF. Also ordinary repair work, purchases of durable household equipment (\"e.g. private cars and furniture\") and animals reared for their meat are not part of GFCF.\n\nIn the 1993 version of the UNSNA (2003 SNA) the acquisition of armaments is not recorded as GFCF but as final consumption expenditure and intermediate consumption. The definition of fixed assets was reviewed with the update of the SNA that led to the System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA). Expenditure on weapons that meet the general definition of assets have been reclassified as GFCF.\n\nIt is sometimes difficult to draw an exact statistical boundary between GFCF and intermediate consumption, insofar as the expenditure concerns alterations to fixed assets owned. In some cases, this expenditure can refer to new fixed investment, in others only to operating costs relating to the maintenance or repair of fixed assets. Some countries include the insurance of fixed assets as part of GFCF.\n\nAn important change in the GFCF boundary in the 2008 SNA relates to the treatment of expenditure on research and development (R&D). R&D which is measured by the value of expenditures on creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, and the use of this stock to devise new applications, it is argued, should be recognized as part of GFCF. This means that R&D expenditure is recorded as the production of an asset instead of intermediate consumption, which has the effect of increasing GDP. This output measure focuses on the direct effect of R&D only; external benefits of R&D are not considered in this output measurement. Also, the 2008 SNA still explicitly excludes human capital as assets.\n\nWhile it is not possible to measure the value of the total fixed capital stock very accurately, it is possible to obtain a fairly reliable measure of the trend in \"net additions to the stock of fixed capital\", since the purchase prices of investment goods are recorded. Usually statistics departments provide quarterly and annual data on GFCF. The GFCF of \"pure\" households is often considered as an indicator of households' confidence in the future since it consists of their investments in dwellings. However, the GFCF figure for dwellings refers only to the value of the net additions of the housing stock and housing improvements.\n\nOften detailed breakdowns are available on request for GFCF,\n\n\nGFCF time series data is often used to analyse the trends in investment activity over time, deflating or reflating the series using a price index. But it is also used to obtain alternative measures of the fixed capital stock. This stock could be measured at surveyed \"book value\", but the problem there is that the book values are often a mixture of valuations such as historic cost, current replacement cost, current sale value and scrap value. That is, there is no uniform valuation.\n\nUsing the alternative of the so-called \"perpetual inventory method\", one begins with a benchmark asset figure and then cumulates GFCF year by year (or quarter by quarter), while deducting depreciation according to some method, all data being adjusted for price inflation using a capital expenditure price index. Sometimes statisticians calculate \"average service lives\" for assets as a basis for valuation and depreciation estimates.\n\nEconometricians acknowledge that the value of fixed assets is almost impossible to measure accurately, because of the difficulty of obtaining a standard valuation for all assets. By implication, it is also almost impossible to obtain a reliable measure of the aggregate rate of profit on physical capital invested, i.e. the rate of return. Arguably though, the data do provide an \"indicator\" of the trend over time; using mathematical models one can estimate that the true rate is most likely to lie within certain quantitative limits.\n\nIn recent times, Eurostat publishes the \"business investment rate\" (also called the \"gross investment rate of non-financial corporations\") in its quarterly sector accounts for the EU27. This ratio is defined as gross fixed capital formation divided by gross value added, in other words the share of GFCF in gross product. It provides an indication of how much of the total factor income is reinvested in new fixed assets. Normally that ratio is about 20–23% of gross value-added. However, calling it the \"business investment rate\" or the \"gross investment rate\" is somewhat deceptive, since this indicator refers only to \"fixed\" investment, and more specifically, the \"net\" fixed investment (fixed assets bought, less disposals of fixed assets). The actual total funds which are spent by enterprises on investments, in gross terms, are much larger, both because enterprises invest in far more than fixed assets only (they also buy intermediate goods and services, and some financial assets), and because the total money they spend on buying fixed assets is larger than the same sum netted of asset disposals. The main reason why this Eurostat indicator is published is that it shows something about the longer-term expectations of enterprises. If business confidence is low, enterprises are less likely to tie up new earnings in additional fixed assets, which are usually held for a number of years. If, on the other hand, business confidence is buoyant, it is more likely that enterprises will spend more of their current earnings on longer-term investments in fixed assets. In turn, the rate at which enterprises invest earnings in longer-term assets is an indicator of business expansion – if the rate declines, then this typically lowers the rate of cumulative business expansion. For example, in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the ratio dropped to slightly below 20% in Q1 2010 from a high of 23% in Q2 2008. Although this 3% drop in the ratio may not seem so large, in reality it signifies a very large amount of money that was no longer spent. The reason is that the total gross investment and gross value-added for the European Union amount to trillions of euro's, while the total gross value-added also fell significantly in 2008-2010.\n\nDifferences in the investment rates between countries very often mirror different levels of economic development and catching-up processes. This may be illustrated for the example of the member states of the European Union. Since the beginning of the millennium the average \"ratio of GFCF to GDP\" fluctuates around 20% in the European Union of 27 member states as a whole (EU-27). For some member states which accessed the Union in 2004 and later (mostly countries in central and eastern Europe where the level of GDP is still comparably low), the ratio rose to more than 25% in some years. When the consumption of fixed capital is deducted from the figures the resulting \"ratio of net fixed capital formation to net domestic product\" is around 8% for the average of the EU-27; again substantially higher ratios of more than 15% can be observed for some of the new EU member states such as Spain. Higher investment rates in poorer countries will lead to more equivalent living condition across Europe in the long-term through accelerated economic growth and an improved equipment of the labour force with modern infrastructure and technology. The detailed data on which these observations were made can be downloaded from Eurostat's website.\n\nInfrastructure spending is considered government investment because it will usually save money in the long run, and thereby reduce the net present value of government liabilities. Spending on physical infrastructure in the U.S. returns an average of about $1.92 for each $1.00 spent on nonresidential construction because it is almost always less expensive to maintain than repair or replace once it has become unusable. Similarly, public subsidy of college tuition will increase the net present value of income tax receipts because college educated taxpayers earn much more than those without college education. Likewise, government spending on social infrastructure, such as preventative health care, can save several hundreds of billions of dollars per year in the U.S., because for example cancer patients are more likely to be diagnosed at Stage I where curative treatment is typically a few outpatient visits, instead of at Stage III or later in an emergency room where treatment can involve years of hospitalization and is often terminal.\n\nThe fixed assets purchased may nowadays include substantial used assets traded on second-hand markets, the quantitatively most significant items being road vehicles, planes, and industrial machinery. Worldwide, this growing trade is worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and countries in Eastern Europe and Latin America, Russia, China, India and Morocco use large quantities of second-hand machinery. Often it is bought from Europe, North America and Japan, where fixed assets are on average scrapped more quickly.\n\nFixed assets disposed of may be sold for continued use by another producer, abandoned by the owner, sold as scrap, or recycled in part or as a whole. But occasionally a complete industrial plant is purchased, dismantled and reassembled somewhere else. Because GFCF conceptually includes many transactions in used fixed assets by resident firms, which are valued lower than new assets, this creates problems for the estimation and valuation of the gross capital stock.\n\nIf enterprise A sells a used asset to enterprise B, the valuation errors caused by the way that A and B each report this transaction will cancel out only if an overstatement of A’s reported GFCF is exactly matched by the understatement in B’s reported GFCF. But if assets migrate from one industry to another, or are imported and exported, or (in the case of means of transport) switch between different uses, the errors will persist. It may appear as though the total fixed capital stock has grown, even although the “net addition to fixed assets” refers only to the change in ownership of an already existing asset.\n\nStatistical treatment of the trade in second-hand fixed assets varies among different countries. Increasingly an attempt is made in many countries to identify the trade in second-hand assets separately if it occurs on a quantitatively significant scale (for example, vehicles). In principle, if a fixed asset is bought during the year by one organization, and then resold to another organization during the same year, it should not be counted as investment twice over in that year; otherwise the true growth of the fixed capital stock would be overestimated. Hence statistical agencies traditionally often measured only the acquisition of \"newly produced\" fixed assets, or else tried to measure the net purchases of used assets. In general, also, the expenditure on Gross Domestic Product of which GFCF is a component should definitionally include only newly produced fixed assets, not second-hand assets. GDP is supposed to measure the net new output, the new value added to the existing stock of wealth. But given a growing domestic and international trade in second-hand equipment, GFCF may understate the true level of gross fixed investment activity and overstate the real additions to the capital stock, insofar as fixed assets produced at a previous time and resold later are also invested in, without this showing up in the accounts.\n\nIn the 1993 UNSNA standards (and earlier), offensive weaponry and their means of delivery were excluded from capital formation, regardless of the length of their service life. Conceptually, the UNSNA accounts regarded military assets as providing \"defence services\" only at the point of their acquisition. Arms expenditure regarded as intermediate consumption could, according to this accounting treatment, only refer to sales or exports in a different accounting period.\n\nIf weapons were sold during the same year or a quarter, this necessitated \"counter-intuitive\" entries in the accounts for government (a capital addition is cited as a capital deduction, and vice versa). The 2008 UNSNA revision therefore recommends that all military expenditure that meets general UNSNA criteria for capital formation (investment in goods which are used in production for more than one year) will be treated as capital formation. Weapons systems and military inventories will be separately distinguished within fixed capital formation and inventories .\n\nThis approach somewhat increases the measure of \"total\" GFCF and by implication the total GDP of arms-producing countries, because expenditures and sales of weaponry are very large, especially in the United States and Europe. According to the Swedish research institute SIPRI, global military expenditure by governments in 2008 is estimated to have totaled $1,464 billion, or approximately 2.4% of the value of world GDP in 2008, but arms expenditure is only one component of this expenditure. In 2007, the combined arms sales of the \"SIPRI Top 100 arms-producing companies\" reached $347 billion. According to SIPRI, forty-four US companies accounted for 61 per cent of the Top 100’s arms sales in 2007, while 32 West European companies accounted for 31 per cent of the sales. Russia, Japan, Israel and India accounted for most of the rest. Including US arms sales in US GDP would raise the measure by up to 1.8%.\n\nThe main original reasons for largely excluding military weaponry expenditures from total asset, investment and gross product measures were that military weaponry is used to destroy people and property, which is not value-adding production (although rebuilding destroyed assets can stimulate the economy), and/or that the relevant figures were a military secret. However, since military capital expenditures consume a large amount of tax money, and because it is difficult to hide expenditures on weaponry, it is nowadays argued that it is appropriate that those expenditures should be publicly accounted for.\n\n"}

He also held political office, from June 10, 1642 to November 23, 1642 as the Viceroy of New Spain. He lost a high-profile struggle with the Jesuits in New Spain, resulting in a recall to Spain, to the minor Diocese of Osma in Old Castile. Although a case was opened for his beatification shortly after he died in 1659, he was not designated \"Blessed\" until 2011.\n\nBorn in Navarre, Spain, Don Juan Palafox y Mendoza was the natural son (\"a child of transgression\") of Jaime de Palafox, the Marquis of Ariaza, of the Aragonese nobility. His mother became a Carmelite nun. He was taken in by a family of millers who gave him the name \"Juan\" and raised him for ten years, after which his father recognized him, and had him educated at Alcalá and Salamanca.\n\nIn 1626 he was a deputy of the nobility in the Cortes de Monzón, and later a prosecutor at the Council of War and a member of the Council of the Indies, the chief administrative body for administration of the overseas territories of the Spanish Empire.\n\nPalafox was ordained in 1629, and became the chaplain of Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress, the sister of King Philip IV of Spain. He accompanied her on her various trips around Europe.\n\nIn 1639 Philip IV nominated him, and Pope Urban VIII appointed him, as Bishop of Puebla de los Ángeles in viceroyal Mexico. Puebla de los Ángeles was the second largest city in the Viceroyalty of New Spain (viceroyal México) then, and is the present day City of Puebla. He was consecrated at Madrid on December 27, 1639.\n\nAs bishop, Palafox arrived in Veracruz on June 24, 1640. He was in the company of the new Viceroy of New Spain, Diego López Pacheco, 7th Duke of Escalona, whom he had gotten to know during the voyage. That same ship brought an Irishman, William Lamport, known in New Spain as Don Guillén de Lombardo y Guzmán, who played a role in political turmoil during the 1640s. Palafox was also named \"Visitador\" (royal inspector, representative of the king), to investigate the two previous viceroys. He served as Bishop of Puebla from 1640 to 1655, and as interim archbishop of Mexico from 1642 to 1643.\n\nHe was embroiled in a major controversy with the Jesuits over ecclesiastical jurisdiction that eventually cost him his post as Bishop of Puebla de los Ángeles. The Spanish crown was moving to displace mendicant orders from their populous and lucrative \"doctrinas\" in central Mexico, and replace them with parishes staffed by secular (diocesan) clergy with benefices rather than mendicants. He was largely successful in doing so in Puebla.\n\nHe then targeted the Jesuits as another entity that did not respect ecclesiastical jurisdiction by paying tithes, essentially a 10% tax on agricultural production, to the Church hierarchy. In the 1640s when he took on the Jesuits, Palafox pointed out that the Jesuit order was a hugely wealthy landowner in New Spain. Jesuits claimed that the income from their haciendas went exclusively toward support of their educational institutions (\"colegios\") and their missionary work on the colonial frontiers. On principle, Palafox asserted that it was the spiritual duty of all to pay the tithe, which the Jesuits steadfastly refused to do. The tithe transferred wealth from the countryside's landed estates to cities and towns, supporting the cathedral chapter, parish priests, and charitable institutions.\n\nObviously, as a powerful bishop, Palafox would have been interested in increasing the revenue from Jesuit tithes, but also in asserting episcopal authority over that order. In 1647, the diocese of Puebla ordered all Jesuits to produce licenses from the diocese to preach and hear confession, something that was required under canon law and empowered bishops. The Jesuits asserted they needed no such licenses, that they could exercise such powers without special permission of a bishop. Palafox wrote that if this were true, that the bishop had no power in his own diocese and he would be separated from his own flock by \"an alien authority\".\n\nThe Jesuits found an ally against Palafox in the new viceroy, García Sarmiento de Sotomayor, 2nd Count of Salvatierra. Salvatierra sought to arrest Palafox. In 1647, rather than be arrested, which might have produced an uprising in Puebla against the viceroy's abuse of authority, Palafox fled to the mountains outside the city. The move was calculated to show the crown that the situation in New Spain was grave, that the viceroy and the Jesuits were challenging the rightful place of episcopal authority. In that he failed and was ultimately humiliated by being recalled to Spain.\n\nPalafox laid formal complaints against the Jesuits at Rome. The pope, however, refused to approve his censures, and all he could obtain was a brief from Pope Innocent X (on May 14, 1648), commanding the Jesuits to respect the episcopal jurisdiction. On May 20, 1655, Palafox and the Jesuits signed an accord, but disagreements continued. In the same year the Jesuits succeeded in securing his transfer to the little see of Osma in Old Castile. Although Palafox's ecclesiastical career went into eclipse, his writings against the Jesuits were subsequently published in France and in the eighteenth century, his writings were used to strengthen the case for regalist authority resulting in the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain and Spanish territories in 1767.\n\nSome of Palafox’s influential anti-Jesuit writings deals with the Chinese Rites controversy. Palafox had jurisdiction as a bishop on certain Asian missions, but - according to Costa Rican scholar Ricardo Martínez Esquivel - the main reason he declared the Jesuit’s tolerance for traditional ancestor worship practices among Chinese converts to Christianity as heretic was “his personal conflict” with the Jesuits.\n\nPalafox founded the Biblioteca Palafoxiana, the first public library in the Americas, on September 5, 1646, stocking it with five thousand books of science and philosophy. He also founded the Dominican Convent of Santa Inés, the Colleges of San Pedro and San Pablo, and the girls school Purísima Concepción. He amended the by-laws of the seminary of San Juan, and worked diligently on completing the cathedral, which was dedicated April 18, 1649.\n\nAs bishop, Palafox y Mendoza distinguished himself by his efforts to protect the Native Americans, forbidding any methods of conversion other than persuasion. Despite being well disposed toward the indigenous, he showed no interest in their history, which others of that era used to bolster notions of a long and distinguished history that predated the Spanish conquest, nor did he attribute anything spiritually special about the New World.\n\nWhile bishop, Palafox was the principal consecrator of Francisco Diego Díaz de Quintanilla y de Hevía y Valdés (1640), Bishop of Durango; Fernando Montero Espinosa (1640), Bishop of Nueva Segovia; Diego de Guevara y Estrada (1642), Archbishop of Santo Domingo; Marcos de Torres y Rueda (1645), Bishop of Yucatán; Juan de Mañozca y Zamora (1645), Archbishop of México; and Diego López de la Vega (1650), Bishop of Badajoz.\nPalafox was an enthusiastic patron of the arts, and it was during his tenure in Puebla that the city became the musical center of New Spain. Composers such as Juan Gutierrez de Padilla, \"maestro di capilla\" of the cathedral under Palafox and the most famous seventeenth century composer in Mexico, brought the latest European music styles to the New World. Palafox also strongly believed in education in general.\n\nAs visitador general, Bishop Palafox had powers to inspect practices in the viceroyalty, but the viceroy himself was protected from the inspector-general's inquiries, thus undermining his ability to pursue effective reform. Palafox's general mission was \"to increase efficiency in government, strengthen royal authority, maximize the extraction of resources, and improve the administration of the viceroyalty\", especially toward increasing the revenues for the crown. Blocked from effective reform, Palafox broke with Viceroy Diego López Pacheco Cabrera y Bobadilla in 1642, a cousin of João of the House of Braganza, accusing the viceroy of being in league with Portugal. Portugal was then in revolt against Spain and successfully achieve independence, with Braganza becoming João I, its king. One scholar has characterized the suspicion of the viceroy's conspiring with rebels as being based on \"slender evidence\". Bishop Palafox claimed to have orders from the Crown, although he did not show them. He arrived secretly in the capital, and in the middle of the night of June 9/10, he met with the Audiencia (high court) and laid out his suspicions. He then ordered that the viceregal palace be surrounded by guards. The following morning Viceroy López Pacheco was informed that he was under arrest and that the bishop had been named archbishop of Mexico and viceroy of New Spain. His possessions were confiscated and he was held for some time before being allowed to return to Spain. In Spain he was acquitted of the charges against him.\n\nDuring his brief term as viceroy, Palafox established the laws governing the University, the Audiencia, and the legal profession. Palafox considered a key duty of the viceroy was to serve as president of the Audiencia, the high court, the seat of justice. Palafox wrote that the viceroy as president of the Audiencia should prudently treat the judges (\"oidores\") with the greatest respect, but also \"preserve the authority and superiority of the head\" i.e., the president/viceroy. Two members of the Audiencia rejected his reforms, and he suspended them from office. Palafox also raised twelve companies of militia to protect the colony against the spread of revolution from Portugal and Catalonia, which was in revolt against the Spanish monarchy. He destroyed the pagan religious statues of the Indians that had been kept in the capital as trophies of the Spanish conquest.\n\nHe was succeeded as viceroy by García Sarmiento de Sotomayor, 2nd Count of Salvatierra on November 23, 1642, but continued to hold the post of visitador. Having a bishop serve as viceroy was not the usual pattern of appointment, but the extraordinary circumstances that prompted to crown to precipitously remove the previous viceroy meant that Palafox was a useful, if temporary, replacement until the crown appointed his successor. The high tension between the new viceroy, Salvatierra, and bishop and visitador general Palafox was not unprecedented however. In 1624 the viceroy the marquis of Gelves had ordered the expulsion of the archbishop from the viceroyalty, in clear terms the civil authority challenging the ecclesiastical. That earlier conflict had resulted in a huge riot in the main plaza of Mexico City and the ouster of the viceroy himself. The conflict between Salvatierra and Palafox, who was then acting as visitador, flared over what might seem a trivial matter, whether or not the viceroy could sit on a cushion when seated with the Audiencia. Palafox said no, since it distinguished the viceroy from the high court judges. However, the practice had been standard with earlier viceroys. Where the performance of power and its prerogatives was important not as minor traditions but as the theater of power, such a conflict was seated in deeper issues.\n\nFollowing the example of an earlier Spanish ecclesiastic in Mexico, Juan González de Mendoza, Juan de Palafox y Mendoza authored a book on China. His \"Historia de la conquista de la China por el Tartaro\" (\"History of the Conquest of China by the Tartars\") reported on the conquest of the Ming China by the Manchus, based on reports that reached Mexico by the way of the Philippines. \nThe work was first published in Spanish in Paris in 1670; a French translation appeared the same year. An English translation, whose full title was \"The History of the Conquest of China by the Tartars together with an Account of Several Remarkable things, Concerning the Religion, Manners, and Customs of Both Nation's, but especially the Latter\", appeared in London in 1676. Palafox's work, based on hearsay, was generally less informed than \"De bello tartarico\", an eyewitness account by the Chinese-speaking Jesuit Martino Martini.\n\nHis writings were published in 15 volumes in Madrid in 1762.\n\nRecently a bi-lingual edition of his observations on Mexican Indians has been published under the title \"Virtues of the Indian/Virtudes del Indio\".\n\nIn 1694 Charles II of Spain petitioned for his canonization; the decree allowing the introduction of the cause of beatification was approved by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726, and in 1758, under Pope Benedict XIV, the procedure for the approval of Palafox's writings was initiated. The process was continued under the Pontificates of Clement XIII and Clement XIV.\n\nHowever, though the process passed through the preliminary stages, securing for Palafox the title of Servant of God, the cause was in effect blocked under Pope Pius VI through the intervention of the Jesuits. A vote by the Congregation then responsible for the cause was taken on 28 February 1777 and twenty-six out of forty one prelates favored the continuation of Palafox's cause of beatification with the proclamation of a decree of heroic virtue; the decree was then submitted to Pope Pius VI for approbation; Pius VI, however, decided to suspend the final decision.\n\nThe cause thus was suspended in 1777 and remained so until 2003, when it was restored under Pope John Paul II; the question of the heroic virtue was returned to the consideration of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. On 17 January 2009 Pope Benedict XVI approved the decree of the said Congregation recognizing Palafox's heroic virtue, thus granting him the title of Venerable. On 8 January 2010 the Congregation of the Causes of Saints accepted a miracle attributed to Palafox's intercession. The decree recognizing the miracle was promulgated by Pope Benedict XVI on 27 March 2010. The cause for his beatification was supported by the Diocese of Osma-Soria in Spain, where he spent the last years of his life and ecclesiastical career, following his unsuccessful struggle with the Jesuits in his Diocese of Puebla in New Spain (Mexico).\n\nAs the long process for holy recognition of Palafox by Vatican, stretching from the late seventeenth century to the early twenty-first, it is clear that there were authorities opposed to his cause. The cause for his beatification likely found favor with John Paul II and his successor Benedict XVI. Both popes strongly advocated for the episcopal authority of the Catholic Church against secular authority, the position that Palafox advocated when he served in Mexico. Popes have considerable authority to delay or fast track causes for beatification and canonization. While Pope John Paul II often announced beatifications during papal visits, a wildly popular move local holy people are so honored, Benedict XVI discontinued the practice of going to the announcing beatifications in person in the home locale. The ceremony for the beatification of Palafox was overseen by the Papal Legate, Cardinal Angelo Amato, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.\n\nJuan de Palafox was finally proclaimed Blessed on 5 June 2011. The rite of beatification was presided over by Cardinal Angelo Amato, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints, by mandate of Pope Benedict XVI. Palafox's feast day is October 6.\n\n\n"}

Established in 1968, Killara High School is one of the highest performing comprehensive non-selective public schools in the state. The success of the school in the Higher School Certificate (HSC) and its reputation as a school with an extensive program of curriculum enrichment make the school highly desirable. Activities such as music, art, dance, drama, debating, sport and strong participation in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme are included in the co-curricular program. Enrolment rose 21% from 2002 to a population of 1400 students in 2009. It now has 1580 students (2016). Currently, accepted catchment areas include Roseville, West Lindfield, Lindfield, East Lindfield, West Killara, Killara, East Killara, West Gordon and East Gordon.\n\nKillara High began construction in 1968 and was completed in 1970. The school facilitated the growing demands of the community in the newly created East Killara. Most of the students who went to Killara in the first years were the eldest in their family, as those with older siblings went to their school, rather than the newly built Killara.\n\nIn the 1980s, Killara High purchased a house occupying a corner of the school area, which later became the language centre, commonly referred to as \"The House\". The House has since been demolished making way for a new block of classrooms.\n\nThe name: \"Killara, an Aboriginal word meaning permanent\"\n\nThe castle: A permanent place, shelter and reassurance, a means of maintaining that which is worthy of preservation, a storehouse of knowledge\n\nThe key: It is a symbol of progression, which opens doors of learning. It is also an emblem of growth and development into adulthood\n\nThe escutcheon: Provide protection, a pivoted keyhole cover\n\nThe motto: , symbolises preservation of the best of the past and continued development into the future\n\nDr Mark Carter, a local boy and former student of the school, was the principal from 2002 until 2013. He won the state school regional principal of the year award in 2005.\nAs a child, he attended Gordon East PS. In September 2013 he was promoted to Director, Public Schools with the Department of Education.\nDeputy Principal Judith Paszek served as Acting Principal until April 2014.\n\nIn Term 2 2014 Jane Dennett was appointed as the new principal. She was previously a teacher in the HSIE Faculty at Killara, but had more recently served as Deputy Principal at Pennant Hills High School.\n\nKillara High School is set on 3.8 hectares of prime bushland, half the area allocated to a typical high school in the region. The school comprises six blocks, (A, B, C, D, E and G) with the school canteen located in C block, and the library in E block. Each block contains around the same number of classrooms (12 to 18) as found at other North Shore public high schools. The school's \"Lion Library\" is named after North Sydney Technical High School's library. When NSTHS closed in 1969, the contents of their library formed the beginning of the new KHS collection. Other facilities include the \"Kerrabee Centre\", which comprises a large hall capable of seating more than 1000 people and a 250-seat performance theatre with state-of-the-art sound and lighting, a small oval named Jubilee Oval which is now occupied by four new portable classrooms, four multi-purpose courts, a large quadrangle, and a small residential building called \"The House\", which has since been demolished to build a new block. Koola Oval across the road is often used for sport and PE classes, and it can be used by students during some lunch breaks.\n\nCapital works since 2003 have resulted in the installation of security fencing, and five COLAs (Covered Outdoor Learning Areas) built around the school, grounds enhancements, upgrades to science laboratories, classrooms and the construction of studios above the canteen. With enrolment rising at the school, the number of demountable classrooms increased from four to eighteen, with an extra two demountable bathroom blocks also put in. Following a period of intensive work by the school and its Parents & Citizens Association, money was allocated in the 2012 NSW Budget to construct a new building at the school. G block opened in 2014, containing specialist technology and art rooms, and a number of general learning spaces. This has reduced the number of demountable classrooms to six.\n\nThe school has consistently ranked among the highest performers in the NSW Higher School Certificate. In 2015 14 Killara High School students were placed on the All Rounders List for achieving the top band (Band 6) in ten or more units of study. 32% of the cohort received an ATAR above 90. Killara High remains one of the highest performing public comprehensive high schools in the \"Sydney Morning Herald's\" ranking list. In 2015, Killara was ranked 55th in the HSC ranking list in NSW. In 2014 the school had been ranked 64th.\nKillara High was the best-performing public comprehensive top non-selective government school in the state for years 20002007, 20092011, and 20132015 by HSC performance.\n\nTeaching at Killara High School is divided amongst 10 curriculum departments, each teaching a variety of related Board of Studies endorsed subjects. The departments are:\n\n\nStudents in Years 7 and 8 at Killara High participate in an integrated sport program coordinated and taught by PDHPE staff, and compete in a number of Sport Gala Days with other schools.\n\nSenior students from Years 9 to 11 also participate in sport throughout the year. These years participate in the Ku-ring-gai Zone Secondary School Sports against other schools. This is known as grade sport, or students may choose a recreational sport. These events are held on Thursday afternoons\n\nThe School also holds various carnivals during the year this includes:\n\nStudents may also compete in the Combined High Schools (CHS) competition in various sports throughout the year\n\nThe school is a participant in the Australian Government \"MindMatters\" program, which focuses on wellbeing and mental health.\n\nKillara High School offers many opportunities for students to engage in leadership within the school. There are currently seven leadership groups in the school, with more than 115 students engaged in improving the school and providing opportunities for the students. These include:\n\n\nMany Killara High School Students in various Years participate in the Rotary Youth Exchange Australia, sending them to many parts of the world.\n\n\nAs a large school, Killara High has a wide range of specialist executive staff. There are three Deputy Principals, who are supported by three Stage Head Teachers, who each look after a Stage or two academic years. There is also a Head Teacher Wellbeing, Head Teacher Administration, and Head Teacher Secondary Studies.\n\nThe school has a Careers Adviser and two teacher-librarians.\n\nKillara High School is structured on a Home Group system, where each student is allocated to a Home Group teacher, who remains with them as they progress through to Year 12. The Home Groups were introduced as a way to ensure that every student had an ongoing connection with a teacher. Year 12 students have access to a staff mentor, chosen by themselves.\n\nKillara High School has an active Parents and Citizens Association that contributes to the life of the school and the opportunities that are offered to students. Meetings are scheduled for 7.00 pm on the third Wednesday of every month, except where this clashes with vacations or school activities.\n\nA Drama Ensemble meets after school and performs a production for an audience.\n\nEach year either a musical or a MADD (Music, Dance, Drama) Festival is produced. In 2014 \"High School Musical\" was produced and MADD will be a feature of Term 2 2016.\n\nKillara High School’s various dance groups have performed at the Sydney North Dance Festival, State Dance Festival, Schools Spectacular, MacDonald Performing Arts Challenge, Rock Eisteddfod and at the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the Pacific School Games and Olympic Games.\n\n\nThere are four houses at Killara High School. These houses are named after Aboriginal words, since the area in which the school sits in Ku-ring-gai is steeped in Aboriginal tradition. The houses are:\n\nThere is also an honours system at Killara High School where students collect honour points from participating in extracurricular activities and completing excellent work in class.\n\nThe more points you earn the higher in the system you go, the ranks are as follows in ascending order:\nEach year Year 12 students are farewelled at a formal dinner with their families, called \"Ekuba\". Traditionally, the Year 12 video, made by students, is a highlight of this evening.\n\nAn annual award ceremony is held to acknowledge the sporting and academic achievements of the students at the school.\n\nEnrolment at Killara High School has, since 2002, increased 21 percent making it one of the three largest government schools in the State. Local enrolment in Year 7 now comprises 87 per cent of the cohort—up from 58 per cent in 2003—in an area with a number of excellent selective and private schools.\n\nThe school has an enrolment policy which involves an area-inclusive zone. Suburbs in the inclusive zone include Killara, East Killara, West Killara, Lindfield, East Lindfield, Gordon, West Gordon, East Gordon, and parts of Roseville and West Lindfield. A detailed map of the local enrolment area and street names can be found on the school website.\n\nParents are also entitled to apply for enrolment of their children at Killara High School if they reside outside the designated local enrolment area but due to the high enrolment numbers, non-local enrolment is difficult as the school is currently at full capacity. The NSW Board of Jewish Education runs Hebrew classes at the school and the school accepts students out of the local enrolment area who have studied Hebrew prior to coming to the school.\n\nKillara High School belongs to the Killara Schools Partnership (KSP) and the North Shore 5 (NS5).\n\nThe KSP consists of KHS and its partner primary schools - Beaumont Road, Gordon East, Killara, Lindfield, Lindfield East and Roseville Public Schools. There is a very strong relationship between the schools, with many students participating in curriculum enrichment activities (STEM, HSIE, public speaking and debating, creative writing, technological studies, sport and creative and performing arts) within the network. Staff involvement in the Quality Teaching Rounds program is also a feature of the KSP. In 2015 a shared school development day was held at KHS, called \"Killara Connect.\" This teach meet-style event brought staff from all seven schools together to share programs.\n\nThe NS5 unites KHS with Chatswood, Ku-ring-gai, St Ives and Turramurra High Schools. A key feature of this network is the Collaboration and Innovation Program, which sees staff combine to develop new programs to enhance student learning. Annual combined school development days are held in the NS5.\n\nIn 2015 KHS became part of the City Country Alliance, which focuses on intercultural understanding. The school has had a strong link with Menindee Central School for a number of years, with regular student visits between both schools. Many students report that visiting Menindee is one of their most important experiences of their secondary school years.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2116315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116315", "title": "Division of Hunter", "text": "Division of Hunter\n\nThe Division of Hunter is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. The division was named after Captain John Hunter, the second Governor of New South Wales. It covers rural, regional and suburban areas centred on the Hunter Region, including the towns of Singleton, Muswellbrook and Cessnock. It also extends into parts of Greater Newcastle, covering suburbs such as Cameron Park, Edgeworth, Toronto and Morisset.\n\nThe current member since the 1996 federal election, is Joel Fitzgibbon, a member of the Australian Labor Party.\n\nThe seat has been in Labor hands since 1910, and for most of that time has been reasonably safe for that party. The Hunter Region has been one of the few areas outside of capital cities where Labor has consistently done well. Among its notable members have been first Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, former Labor Leaders Matthew Charlton and Dr H.V. Evatt, and Joel Fitzgibbon, who was a minister in the first and second Rudd governments.\n\nThe seat has been held by two father-son combinations. Rowley James held the seat from 1928 to 1958 before giving it up for Evatt, who was in danger of losing his Sydney-area seat of Barton and wanted a friendlier seat in which to run. Evatt was succeeded after one term by Rowley James' son, Bert, who held it until 1980. Eric Fitzgibbon won the seat in 1984, handing it to his son and current member, Joel, in 1996.\n\nHunter had become somewhat marginal in the 1980s when much of its territory was shifted to the newly created Charlton. Since 1990, Labor has never tallied less than 53 percent of the two-party-preferred vote. Labor's worst two-party-preferred vote was 2.4% in 1984 and best result when challenged by an opposing center-right candidate was 80.6% in 1961.\n\nLabor's worst first-preference vote was in 2019, when the current member won only 37.5% of the primary vote; the previous 100-year worst being 44.5% in 2013, again by the incumbent member. Labor's best primary vote was a thumping 76.9% in 1946. As of 2019, the Division of Hunter is considered a marginal seat.\n\nIn 2015 the Australian Electoral Commission announced plans to abolish the federation seat of Hunter. Due to changing populations, overall, New South Wales was to lose a seat while Western Australia was to gain an extra seat. Electors in the north of Hunter were to join New England. The roughly 40 percent remainder were to become part of Paterson, with the Liberal margin calculated to be notionally reduced from 9.8 percent to just 0.5 percent as a result. Since the Commission's guidelines require it to preserve the names of original electorates where possible, the commission proposed renaming Charlton to Hunter.\n\nThe final plan, however, saw Charlton abolished, with Hunter pushed slightly eastward to absorb much of Charlton's former territory. While most of the new Hunter's voters come from the old Charlton, as previously mentioned, Commission guidelines required the name of Hunter to be retained. The Labor incumbent for Charlton, Pat Conroy, brokered a factional deal to contest neighbouring Shortland in order to allow Fitzgibbon to continue to represent Hunter.\n\n"}

{"id": "2116323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116323", "title": "Dum Diversas", "text": "Dum Diversas\n\nDum Diversas (English: \"Until different\") is a papal bull issued on 18 June 1452 by Pope Nicholas V. It authorized Afonso V of Portugal to conquer Saracens and pagans and consign them to \"perpetual servitude\". Pope Calixtus III reiterated the bull in 1456 with \"Inter Caetera\" (not to be confused with Alexander VI's), renewed by Pope Sixtus IV in 1481 and Pope Leo X in 1514 with \"Precelse denotionis\". The concept of the consignment of exclusive spheres of influence to certain nation states was extended to the Americas in 1493 by Pope Alexander VI with \"Inter caetera\".\n\nBy the summer of 1452 Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II had completed the Rumelihisarı fortress on the western or European side of the Bosphorus. Located several miles north of Constantinople, it commanded the narrowest part of the Bosporus. Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI wrote to Pope Nicholas for help. Issued less than a year before the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the bull may have been intended to begin another crusade against the Ottoman Empire. Nicholas V's nephew, Loukas Notaras, was Megas Doux of the Byzantine Empire. It was not until Alfonso V of Portugal responded to a Papal call for aid against the Turks that Pope Nicholas V agreed to support the Portuguese claims regarding territory in Africa. Although some troops arrived from the mercantile city-states in the north of Italy, Pope Nicholas did not have the influence the Byzantines thought that he had over the Western kings and princes. France and England were both weakened by the Hundred Years' War, and Spain was still engaged in conflict with Islamic strongholds in Iberia. Any western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength.\n\nIn mid-15th-century Portugal, the ideals of chivalric honour and crusading were seen as the path for ambition and success. During the reign of Afonso V, the Portuguese nobility enjoyed great influence and prestige, and for several decades, the house of Bragança was the wealthiest and most influential force in the kingdom. In 1415, the wisdom and the justice of an attack on Morocco had to be seriously weighed, but during the reign of Afonso V and for the century afterward, \"such enterprises were accepted as self-justifying crusades for religion, chivalry, and honor\".\n\nThe raids and attacks of the Reconquista created captives on both sides, who were either ransomed or sold as slaves. The Portuguese crown extended that to North Africa. After the attack on Ceuta, the king sought papal recognition of it as a crusade. Similarly, after the 1441 attack on Mauretania, the crown again sought after the fact, papal acknowledgement that it was part of a just conflict. Such a determination would then indicate that those captured could legitimately be sold as slaves.\n\nTo confirm the Portuguese trade rights, King Afonso V appealed to Pope Nicholas V for support, seeking the moral authority of the Church for his monopoly. The bull of 1452 was addressed to Afonso V and conceded Portugal's right to attack, conquer and subjugate Saracens and pagans.\nWilhelm Grewe finds \"Dum Diversas\" essentially \"geographically unlimited\" in its application, perhaps the most important papal act relating to Portuguese colonisation. Although undefined, Richard Raiswell finds that it clearly refers to the recently discovered lands along the coast of West Africa. Portuguese ventures were intended to compete with the Muslim trans-Sahara caravans, which held a monopoly on West African gold and ivory.\n\nPope Calixtus III reiterated the main points of \"Dum Diversas\" in his bull four years later, \"Inter Caetera\". Once again the Pope was attempting to raise support for a campaign against the advance of the Turks. Nuncios had been dispatched to all the countries of Europe to beseech the princes to join once more in an effort to check the danger of a Turkish invasion. However, the princes of Europe were slow in responding to the call of the pope, largely due to their own national rivalries. On 29 June 1456, Callixtus ordered the church bells to be rung at noon (see noon bell) as a call to prayer for the welfare of those defending Belgrade. Forces led by Janos Hunyady, Captain-General of Hungary, met the Turks and defeated them at Belgrade on 22 July 1456.\n\nOn March 13, 1456, Callixtus issued the papal bull \"Inter Caetera\" (not to be confused with \"Inter Caetera\" of 1493). This bull reaffirmed the earlier bulls \"Dum Diversas\" and \"Romanus Pontifex\", which recognized Portugal's rights to territories it had discovered along the West African coast, and the reduction of the infidels and non-Christians territories to perpetual vassals of the Christian monarch. \n\nKing Afonso had requested that ecclesiastical jurisdiction over lands located in the vicinity of the southern shore of Guinea be vested with the Order of Christ, the successor organization to the Knights Templars in Portugal. (His uncle, Infante Henry, was the Grand Master.) The conquest of these lands \"... which the said infante withdrew with mailed hands from the hand of the Saracen...\", had been funded by the resources of the Order.\n\nSome historians view these bulls together as extending the theological legacy of Pope Urban II's Crusades to justify European colonization and expansionism, accommodating \"both the marketplace and the yearnings of the Christian soul.\" A combination of pragmatism, fear of the Turks, and lobbying by vested interests meant that the crusade was associated with discovery well into the sixteenth century. The proclamations' long-term implications were, of course, not realized at the time.\n\nIn 1537 pope Paul III condemned \"unjust\" enslavement of non-Christians in Sublimus Dei. In 1686 the Holy Office limited the bull by decreeing that Africans enslaved by unjust wars should be freed.\n\n\"Dum Diversas\", along with other bulls such as \"Romanus Pontifex\" (1455), \"Ineffabilis et summi\" (1497), \"Dudum pro parte\" (1516), and \"Aequum reputamus\" (1534) document the Portuguese \"ius patronatus\". Pope Alexander VI, a native of Valencia, issued a series of bulls limiting Portuguese power in favor of that of Spain, most notably \"Dudum siquidem\" (1493).\n\n\n"}

He is one of the founding members of the Hawaii Regional Cuisine movement.\n\nRoy Yamaguchi is the chef and founder of a collection of restaurants including 30 Roy's Restaurants in the United States and Guam, the Tavern by Roy Yamaguchi and Eating House 1849. He is revered for his culinary skills and is known as the innovator of Hawaiian inspired cuisine, an eclectic blend of California-French-Japanese cooking traditions created with fresh ingredients from the Islands. He was honored with the James Beard \"Best Pacific Northwest Chef\" Award in 1993. Yamaguchi has earned honors including California Chef of the Year (California Restaurant Writers Association), Gault-Millau Top 40 (Forbes FYI), Top 50 Cuisines in America (Conde Nast Traveler), Fine Dining Hall of Fame (Nation's Restaurant News) and the John Heckathorn Dining Excellence Award (Honolulu Magazine).\n\nYamaguchi was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan. His Hawaiian roots are tied to his paternal grandfather who owned a tavern in Wailuku, Maui in the 1940s. He attributes his appreciation for food to his Hawaii-born father and his Okinawa-born mother. Upon graduating from high school, Yamaguchi enrolled in the Culinary Institute of America (CIA) in New York where he received his formal culinary training. After graduating in 1976, he accepted positions at some of the most prestigious California restaurants at the time, L'Escoffier, L'Ermitage, Le Serene, Michael's, and Le Gourmet in the Sheraton Plaza La Reina. In 1984, Yamaguchi opened his first restaurant, 385 North, in Hollywood. In 1988, he moved to Honolulu to open the first Roy's Restaurant. Since that time, he has opened 29 restaurants in the United States, as well as others in Japan, Guam, and Hong Kong. He also teamed with Outback Steakhouse to open a Eurasian-themed restaurant in Florida.\n\nYamaguchi is also known as a television personality, hosting six seasons of the PBS series \"Hawaii Cooks with Roy Yamaguchi\". He was featured on the Food Network's \"My Country, My Kitchen\", taking him back to his roots in Japan. Yamaguchi also competed as one of twelve of the nation's most notable chefs on the first season of Bravo Channel's \"Top Chef Masters\", and also appeared as Iron Chef Asian, in the first American incarnation of \"Iron Chef USA\".\n\nIn 2004, he launched a \"Roy Yamaguchi\" brand of cookware that sold on the Home Shopping Network.

He has published four cookbooks: \"Pacific Bounty\", \"Roy's Feasts from Hawaii\", \"Hawaii Cooks: Flavors from Roy's Pacific Rim Kitchen\", and \"Roy's Fish and Seafood\".\n\nIn addition to the acclaim his restaurants have received, Yamaguchi's personal influence and community involvement have placed him among the most influential chefs in the nation. In 1996, he gave the commencement speech to graduating class of the CIA, and in 2009, was elected to their Board of Trustees. In 2011, Yamaguchi was nominated by the late U.S. Senator Daniel K. Inouye and was appointed to the board of the Corporation for Travel Promotion, now known as Brand USA. He is one of eleven board members for Brand USA, and has used his culinary and travel experience to help develop policies and strategies to promote the U.S. as a travel destination.

The movie, shot mostly in New York City, was released shortly after the end of World War II. \"The House on 92nd Street\" was made with the full cooperation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), whose director, J. Edgar Hoover, appears during the introductory montage. Also, the FBI agents shown in Washington, D.C. were played by actual agents. The film's semidocumentary style inspired other films, including \"The Naked City\" and \"Boomerang\".\n\nIn 1939, American standout university student Bill Dietrich is approached by Nazi recruiters because of his German heritage. He feigns interest, then notifies the FBI. Agent George Briggs encourages Dietrich to play along. Thus, Dietrich travels to Hamburg, Germany, where he undergoes six months of intensive training in espionage. The Germans then send him back to the United States to set up a radio station on Long Island to relay secret information on shipping arrivals, departures, destinations, and cargo. Dietrich is also to act as paymaster to the spies already there and who meet regularly at a house on East 92nd Street in New York City. He is told that only a certain \"Mr. Christopher\" has the authority to alter the details of his assignment.\n\nDietrich passes along his microfilmed credentials as a Nazi agent to the FBI. Agents decide to alter his authorized status so that instead of being forbidden to contact most of the agents, he is authorized to meet all of them. The 92nd Street residence is actually a multi-storied building with a dress shop, serving as a front for German agents, on the first floor. His contact is dress designer Elsa Gebhardt. She reacts suspiciously to Dietrich's high degree of authority. She requests confirmation from Germany, but communication is slow. Thus, she has no choice but to allow Dietrich full access to her spy ring. When questioned, Dietrich's other legitimate contact, veteran espionage agent Colonel Hammersohn, denies knowing \"Mr. Christopher's\" identity.\n\nIn a separate development, a German spy is killed in a traffic accident; the FBI finds a secret message among his possessions stating that a \"Mr. Christopher\" will concentrate on Process 97. Briggs is alarmed because he is aware that Process 97 is America's most closely guarded secret—the atomic bomb project. And when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the United States enters the war. Most of the spies Dietrich has identified are immediately picked up, but the FBI purposely overlooks Gebhardt's ring and intend to do so until \"Mr. Christopher's\" identity is established.\n\nWhile Gebhardt instructs Dietrich to transmit a key portion of Process 97 immediately to Germany, he notices a cigarette butt in non-smoker Gebhardt's otherwise empty ashtray. He surreptitiously secures the butt and sends it to the FBI, where agents trace the clue to Luise Vadja, and from her to her supposed boyfriend, Charles Ogden Roper, a scientist working on Process 97. Roper is picked up and questioned. He breaks while under interrogation and confesses to have hidden the last part of Process 97 in a copy of Spencer's \"First Principles\" at a bookstore from where a person believed to be \"Mr. Christopher\" had been filmed by agents. Briggs then orders the immediate arrest of Gebhardt's ring.\n\nIn the meantime, Gebhardt finally receives a reply from Germany, confirming her suspicions of not only Dietrich's limited authority but of his true loyalties. She injects him with scopolamine in an attempt to obtain information, but her building is surrounded by government agents. Gebhardt orders her underlings to hold them off while she disguises as a man—the elusive \"Mr. Christopher\"—and tries to sneak out with the final vital papers on Process 97 that she has just retrieved from the bookstore. Unable to climb down the fire escape, she returns, only to be accidentally shot by one of her own men. The rest are captured, and Dietrich is rescued.\n\n\n\"The House on 92nd Street\" is the first film noir produced by Louis De Rochemont, credited as a pioneer of the semidocumentary style police thriller.\n\nTCM's host, Robert Osborne, said that the film is based on the real life case of William G. Sebold. He also said that they used real FBI agents and with real footage taken by the FBI. Sebold was involved in bringing down the Duquesne Spy Ring in 1941, the largest convicted espionage case in the history of the United States. On January 2, 1942, 33 Nazi spies, including the ring leader Fritz Joubert Duquesne (also known as \"The man who killed Kitchener\"), were sentenced to more than 300 years in prison. One German spymaster later commented that the ring’s roundup delivered ‘the death blow’ to their espionage efforts in the United States. J. Edgar Hoover called his concerted FBI swoop on Duquesne's ring the greatest spy roundup in U.S. history.\n\nLloyd Nolan would reprise his role as Inspector Briggs in the sequel, \"The Street with No Name\" (1948). In that film, Briggs and the FBI agents would take on organized crime.\nThe actual house used in the filming of the movie stood at 53 E 93rd street. It is no longer there - it is now a pathway leading to premises behind the original house.\n\nThomas M. Pryor, film critic for \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"\"The House on Ninety-second Street\" barely skims the surface of our counterespionage operations, but it reveals sufficient of the FBI's modus operandi to be intriguing on that score alone.\"\n\nAlthough praised when released in 1945, the film, when released on DVD in 2005, received mostly mixed reviews. Christopher Null, writing for Filmcritic.com, writes, \"Today, it comes across as a bit goody-goody, pandering to the FBI, pedantic, and not noirish at all.\"\n\nWins\n\n\"The House on 92nd Street\" was presented on \"Stars in the Air\" May 3, 1952. The 30-minute adaptation starred Humphrey Bogart and Keefe Brasselle.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2116375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116375", "title": "Three Sisters (Pittsburgh)", "text": "Three Sisters (Pittsburgh)\n\nThe Three Sisters are three very similar self-anchored suspension bridges spanning the Allegheny River in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at 6th, 7th, and 9th streets, generally running north/south. The bridges have been given formal names to honor important Pittsburgh residents:\n\n\nDesigned by the Allegheny County Department of Public Works, they were all built in a four-year period, from 1924 to 1928, by the American Bridge Company, replacing earlier bridges of various designs at the same sites. Their construction was mandated by the War Department, citing navigable river clearance concerns. They are constructed of steel, and use steel eyebars in lieu of cables.\n\nThe Three Sisters are historically significant because they are the only trio of nearly identical bridges, as well as the first self-anchored suspension spans, built in the United States. They are among the only surviving examples of large eyebar chain suspension bridges in America, and furthermore, unusual for their self-anchoring designs. The bridges’ design was viewed as a creative response to the political, commercial, and aesthetic concerns of Pittsburgh in the 1920s.\n\nThe bridges were designed under the auspices of the Allegheny County Department of Public Works, by T. J. Wilkerson, consulting engineer; Vernon R. Covell, chief engineer; A. D. Nutter, design engineer; and Stanley L. Roush, architect. The American Bridge Company built the superstructure; while the Foundation Company built the substructure.\nAll three bridges are owned by Allegheny County.\n\nFrom 1926 through 1931, four suspension bridges were constructed across the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers. The fourth bridge (not covered in this article) is a wire cable bridge carrying South Tenth Street across the Monongahela.\n\nThe \"Three Sisters Bridges\" represent an adaptive engineering design response to political and technical concerns. County engineers successfully overcame challenges presented by federally mandated clearances, aesthetic and financial considerations raised by local agencies, and the lack of adequate anchorage points along the river banks. They were the first self-anchored suspension bridges built in the United States. The design’s solid plate deck-stiffening girder provided compressive support while lowering visual barriers between Pittsburgh and the historically distinct North side (formerly Allegheny City), annexed in 1907 in a contentious fight.\n\nThe American Bridge Company, the builder and steel supplier for these three bridges, was headquartered nearby, as was the Foundation Company which had the pier/abutment masonry contract. Local election campaigns during the period highlighted the intent to use local suppliers and labor.\n\nA suspension bridge works by hanging a roadway from cables or chains under tension. Though a few unstiffened suspension bridges exist, a longitudinal stiffening truss or girder is usually added to prevent excessive movement of the deck. The cables pass over towers and are anchored at both ends. Conventional suspension bridges use massive concrete or rock anchorages to resist the cable’s tension. In self-anchored suspension bridges, however, the cables are fastened to both ends of the longitudinal girders. These girders are therefore compression struts in addition to stiffening the roadway.\n\nBecause each of Pittsburgh's Three Sisters appears to be a self-contained unit not dependent on the river banks for anchorage, a debate ensued among engineers whether these structures were cantilevers rather than suspension bridges. Current wisdom holds them to be the latter. Each bridge was built in halves toward the center, with temporary diagonal struts placed between chain and deck to provide shear resistance. These struts temporarily turned each incomplete half into a trussed cantilever arm. The struts 'freed themselves' when the tension on them was removed by jacking each halve and connecting them together to form a suspension bridge.\n\nA driving force for the three bridges all being constructed at once was that the predecessor bridges were all out of compliance with War Department standards for minimum width and clearance over channels for bridges crossing navigable waters such as the Ohio, the Allegheny, and the Monongahela.\n\nThe previous bridges were all owned by private companies established to build bridges and pay them off through toll collection. The bridges were quite profitable, with several of the companies in the area paying 15% dividends yearly to stock holders, even with tolls at 1 cent per man and free for women. \n\nSome controversy ensued over whether public entities could take bridges or bridge rights of way away from private companies if the companies had already retired their construction loans.\n\nAt some point, the public supported a \"free bridges\" movement that supported government buying out the bridge companies and abolishing tolls. Between that and the War department ruling that government-owned bridges would not need to be corrected as quickly, the bridge companies were willing to sell and did so before 1910. The County (rather than City or State) bought the companies out at fair market value.\n\nThus the county had to deal with the problem of non compliance when the war department raised it again at the end of the 1910s. Through the teens and early 20s bond issues were floated before the voters to finance replacement but repeatedly failed, in part because voters of the time saw public works as a source of corruption, especially at the county level.\n\nIn 1924, voters finally approved a $29.2 million bond issue at the county level to improve bridges and municipal structures. Several proposals were made for lift bridges of various sorts, including a scheme to raise an existing bridge on mechanical jacks, but the War Department did not approve, insisting on a failure proof means of clearance. The Seventh Street Bridge was razed in 1924, and the War Department forced the razing of the 9th as well, despite the inconvenience to the city.\n\nAfter much design work, two truss bridges at 6th and 9th and a cantilever bridge at 7th were approved, and submitted to the Metropolitan Art Commission, a forgotten body that had approval rights for any bridge over $25,000 in the City of Pittsburgh. Expecting a rubber stamp, contracts were let, but to everyone's shock the commission vetoed the designs as unaesthetic, preferring suspension bridges. But shoreline clearances were tight and two of the older suspension bridges had experienced problems with insecure anchorages. It is not clear who suggested a self-anchoring suspension bridge design, as the only precedent known at that time was a 1915 bridge over the Rhine at Cologne the Deutzer Hängebrücke.\n\nHowever, by 1922 one of the better known advisors on cantilever and suspension bridge structures noted the peculiar strengths represented in the Cologne bridge’s design. David B. Steinman’s running dispute with J. A. L. Waddell about the relative costs of suspension and cantilever bridges continued a debate with roots in the Quebec Bridge collapse. The 1907 construction disaster, accompanied by the 1916 accident during a second attempt, heightened a growing preference for suspension bridges. In light of the popular and engineering support for suspension structures, Steinman’s first edition of \"A Practical Treatise on Suspension Bridges\" fed a growing demand for technical information about components such as eye-bars and stiffening systems. Steinman’s reputation and the fact that his book was reviewed in the engineering press make it likely that Allegheny County’s engineers could have examined the first edition of this book.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a moribund language with only about 10-20 native speakers left. It was spoken mainly along the Ume River in the south of present-day Arjeplog, in Sorsele and in Arvidsjaur.\n\nThe best-known variety of Ume Sami is that of one Lars Sjulsson (born 1871) from Setsele, close to Malå, whose idiolect was documented by W. Schlachter in a 1958 dictionary and subsequent work. Dialect variation exists within the Ume Sami area, however. A main division is between more (north)western dialects such as those of Maskaure, Tärna and Ullisjaure (typically agreeing with Southern Sami), versus more (south)eastern dialects such as those of Malå, Malmesjaure and Mausjaure (typically agreeing with Pite Sami).\n\nAn and are allophones of and . When a sound occurs before a plosive or an affricate sound, they are then realized as preaspirated sounds. If an sound occurs before a sound, it is realized as a palatal lateral sound.

A schwa sound may exist as an allophone of various vowel sounds.\n\nUntil 2010, Ume Sámi did not have an official written standard, although it was the first Sámi language to be written extensively (because a private christian school for Sámi children started in Lycksele 1632, where Ume Sámi was spoken). The New Testament was published in Ume Sámi in 1755 and the first Bible in Sámi was also published in Ume Sámi, in 1811.\n\nThe current official orthography is maintained by the Working Group for Ume Sámi, whose most recent recommendation was published in 2016.\n\nShortcomings:\n\nUnlike its southern neighbor Southern Sámi, Ume Sámi has consonant gradation. However, gradation is more limited than it is in the more northern Sami languages, because it does not occur in the case of short vowels followed by a consonant that can gradate to quantity 1 (that is, Proto-Samic single consonants or geminates). In these cases, only quantity 3 appears. Consonant clusters can gradate regardless of the preceding vowel.\n\nThe verbs in Ume Sámi have three persons, first, second and third. There are three grammatical numbers: singular, dual and plural.\n\nUme Sámi has two grammatical moods: indicative and imperative\n\nUme Sámi, like Finnish, the other Sámi languages, and Estonian, has a negative verb.

It became evident that a better way to program the machine was needed, and quickly. Waiting for the completion of \"Connection Machine Lisp\" (CM Lisp), an implementation of the very high-level programming language Lisp with parallel computing extensions) was not an option. CM Lisp had been proposed by Danny Hillis, and development was expected to continue for several more years.\n\nA *Lisp interpreter was initially developed. It became apparent quickly that a *Lisp compiler, translating *Lisp into Lisp and PARIS, would be needed to attain the gigaFLOPS speed that was attainable in theory by a Connection Machine. The *Lisp compiler was written by Jeff Mincy and was first released in 1986. An application achieving more than two gigaFLOPS, a helicopter wake simulator, was developed by Alan Egolf, then an employee of United Technologies, and J. P. Massar, a Thinking Machines employee, in 1987.\n\nA *Lisp Simulator, an emulator meant to run *Lisp code on standard, non-parallel machines, was developed at the same time by J. P. Massar. This simulator still exists, and was ported to American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Common Lisp (CL) in 2001. An older version written in the original CL, exists in the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) artificial intelligence (AI) repository.\n\nLater versions of *Lisp, involving significant upgrades to its functions and performance, were worked on by Cliff Lasser, Jeff Mincy, and J. P. Massar through 1989. *Lisp was implemented on the Thinking Machines CM5 circa 1990–1991 by J. P. Massar and Mario Bourgoin.\n\nStarLisp was written on Common Lisp (CL), and thus had the full power of CL behind it. To use a Connection Machine, one needed a host or \"front-end\". To use *Lisp, that front-end had to run CL. Symbolics' machines using Genera and Sun Microsystems workstations running Lucid Inc.'s Lucid Common Lisp were both used to operate *Lisp.\n\nStarLisp operated on \"P\"arallel \"Var\"iable\"s\" (PVARS). These represented Connection Machine memory, and were essentially vectors: one element per CM processor (or virtual processor).\n\nStarLisp consisted of standard operations on PVARS, like vector addition and multiplication, along with communication primitives that essentially reordered the elements of a PVAR using the CM's communication hardware to optimally route the data.\n"}

It is more a drama than a comedy, although it combines aspects of both. It was directed by Charles Sturridge and featured an ensemble cast of American, Australian, British, and French actors and actresses. The title evokes the Rupert Brooke poem \"The Soldier\".\n\nThe film was driven into production by Alec Guinness who used his influence with the BBC to make it and with the various famous actors to appear in it. Writer Roy Clarke won much acclaim for \"A Foreign Field\".\n\nCyril (McKern) and Waldo (Randolph), who are British and American, respectively, have both returned to France in search of the same woman (Moreau) with whom they each had a rendezvous in 1944 (unknown to the other). Cyril is accompanied by fellow veteran Amos (Guinness), while Waldo has his petty daughter Beverly (Chaplin) and her henpecked husband (Herrmann) in tow. Amos is childlike and carries an empty jam jar as if it is a favored toy. The two groups encounter one another, and after some conflict find common ground in old sorrows. Along the way they meet the recently widowed Lisa (Bacall), who has come in search of her brother's grave.\n\nEventually it is revealed that Amos saved Cyril's life during the battle of Normandy in 1944 but sustained a severe head-wound in the process. The wound has left Amos permanently brain-damaged and Cyril has been his carer ever since. Cyril also confides in the others that Amos does not have long left to live and this will be the last chance for the two men to come to Normandy to pay their respects to their close friend Briggs who was killed in action. Waldo has come to France for a similar reason, to visit the grave of a close buddy who was killed on D-Day. The trip helps put Beverly's problems into perspective and gives a new lease of life to her marriage. And it is revealed that Lisa's brother was in fact a German soldier but instead of showing hostility, the veterans instead pay their respects at his grave, in tribute to the bravery of the German forces who took part in the battle. The frame is completed via Amos' jam jar with the final image of the jar holding a handful of wildflowers and placed in front of Briggs' gravestone on Omaha Beach.\n\n\nThe film was shot entirely around the department of Calvados, in France.\n\nA Foreign Field was released on DVD in 2018 by Simply Media.\n"}

It is widely termed as the Probation Period of an employee. This status allows a supervisor or other company manager to evaluate closely the progress and skills of the newly hired worker, determine appropriate assignments, and monitor other aspects of the employee such as honesty, reliability, and interactions with co-workers, supervisors or customers.\n\nA probationary period varies widely depending on the business, but can last anywhere from 30 days to several years. In cases of several years, probationary levels may change as time goes on. If the new employee shows promise and does well during the probationary time, they are usually removed from probationary status, and may be given a raise or promotion as well (in addition to other privileges, as defined by the business). Probation is usually defined in a company's employee handbook, which is given to workers when they first begin a job.\n\nThe probationary period also allows an employer to terminate an employee who is not doing well at their job or is otherwise deemed not suitable for a particular position or any position. Whether or not this empowers employers to abuse their employees by, without warning, terminating their contract before the probation period has ended is open for debate. To avoid problems arising from the termination of a new employee, many companies are waiving the probationary period entirely, and instead conducting multiple interviews of the candidate, under a variety of conditions – before making the decision to hire. \n\nThe placement of an employee on probationary status is usually at the discretion of their manager.\n"}

It typically has three types of content:\nThe employee handbook is almost always a part of a company's onboarding or induction process for new staff. A written employee handbook gives clear advice to employees and creates a culture where issues are dealt with fairly and consistently.\n\nWhile it often varies from business to business, specific areas that an employee handbook may address include:\n\nRevisions to an employee handbook vary from company to company. At many larger companies, a revised handbook comes out annually or at other regular intervals. It is recommended that handbooks be updated regularly as laws and regulations change.\n\nNew employees are often required to sign an acknowledgement form stating they have received, read and understand the information within the employee handbook and accept its terms.\n\nAcknowledgement forms typically have additional content:\nFailure of an employee to sign the acknowledgement form within a timely manner may prevent them from being hired or may result in termination.\n\nIn 2009, Netflix publicly released a presentation entitled Netflix Culture: Freedom & Responsibility that described their movement away from a company culture based on command and control and towards one centered around freedom and responsibility. The presentation went viral and as of March 2018 had over 17 million views.\n\nBecause the presentation also discusses other common company policies, it is often referred to as Netflix's employee handbook. It has been very influential, with many companies copying their \"unlimited\" vacation policy and their simple \"Act in Netflix’s best interests\" expenses policy.\n\nAlongside the Valve Handbook for New Employees and the Zappos Culture Book, the presentation has influenced many companies to create culture-first employee handbooks that highlight their company culture instead of or before policies that would be found in a traditional employee handbook. Even the policies are rewritten in a much different way than tradition would dictate, or include informal summaries or introductions in plain language.\n\nFederal and state laws and the growing number of cases of employee-related litigation against management strongly suggests that a written statement of company policy is a business necessity for firms of any size.\n\nFor example, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reported that in 2005, companies paid out more than $378 million in discrimination non-litigated settlements. In 2014, the EEOC received a total of 88,778 discrimination charges filed against private businesses.\n\nOther examples of litigation against a company stemming from employee actions are the release of a customer's private information and, of course, the actions of one employee against another; sexual harassment being one type of offensive employee conduct.\n\nThat said, some legal counsels recommend very small companies (less than 10 or 15 employees) to not have a handbook at all because most very small companies find it difficult to dedicate time or resources to maintaining an up-to-date employee handbook. It may be less risky for very small companies to not have documented policies at all rather than having misleading, out-of-date, or incomplete policies. However, others have maintained that there are benefits to small organizations, such as some NGOs, to maintain a quality policy manual for staff.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of any employee handbook is that the handbook is kept current as laws change. If a company chooses to publish its handbook in multiple languages, each version should be updated concurrently.\n\nEmployee handbooks are of a great necessity when it comes to running a business, they help employers manage their business without any complications and conflicts of interest, they also help employees gain an understanding of what is expected of them while being employed.\n\nEmployee handbooks should be reviewed by an attorney for consistency and compliance with current federal and state or provincial laws. As an example, many US states have specific laws that go above and beyond federal laws. Because of this, a New Mexico employee handbook should not be used in California. In the US, California is the state with the highest number of regulations that go above and beyond federal law. Companies operating there usually have special content for California employees. Other states that will typically require special content are New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, Connecticut, Washington DC, and Texas.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the employee handbook may also form part of an employee's terms and conditions of employment. If five or more people are employed, it is a requirement of the Health and Safety at Work Act to have a written statement of the company's health and safety policy.\n\n"}
{"id": "2116412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116412", "title": "Christian Schad", "text": "Christian Schad\n\nChristian Schad (August 21, 1894February 25, 1982) was a German painter and photographer. He was associated with Dada and the New Objectivity movement. Considered as a group, Schad's portraits form an extraordinary record of life in Vienna and Berlin in the years following World War I.\n\nSchad was born in Miesbach, Upper Bavaria, to a prosperous lawyer who supported him for nearly half his life. He studied at the art academy in Munich in 1913. A pacifist, he fled to Switzerland in 1915 to avoid service in World War I, settling first in Zurich and then in Geneva. Both cities were centers of the Dada movement, and Schad became a Dadaist. In Zurich, he met Dadaists like Hans Arp and Hugo Ball, and also Walter Serner, with whom he launched \"Sirius\", a literary review. He was witness of the foundation of the famous Cabaret Voltaire. Beginning in 1918, while living in Geneva, Schad created his own version of the \"Photogram\" (which later was named \"Schadographs\" by Tristan Tzara) where a contour picture is developed on chloride printing-out paper. From 1920 to 1925, he spent some years in Rome and Naples. Having married Marcella Arcangeli, the daughter of a Roman professor, he settled in Naples where he attended painting and drawing courses at the art academy. In 1927 the family emigrated to Vienna. His paintings of this period are closely associated with the New Objectivity movement. In the late twenties, he returned to Berlin and settled there.\n\nSchad's art was not condemned by the Nazis in the same way that the work of Otto Dix, George Grosz, Max Beckmann, and many other artists of the New Objectivity movement was; this may have been because his work appeared superficially more conventional. He became interested in Eastern philosophy around 1930, and his artistic production declined precipitously. After the crash of the New York stock market in 1929, Schad could no longer rely on his father's financial support, and he largely stopped painting in the early 1930s In 1937, unknown to him, the Museum of Modern Art showed three Schadographs, given by Tristan Tzara, in a show about Dada and Surrealism. The same year, the Nazis included Schad in the \"Great German Art\" exhibition, their \"antidote\" to the \"Degenerate Art\"show.\n\nSchad lived in obscurity in Germany through the war and after it. After the destruction of his studio in 1943 Schad moved to Aschaffenburg. The city commissioned him to copy Matthias Grünewald's Virgin and Child (Stuppach, parish church), a project on which he worked until 1947. When his Berlin studio was destroyed in aerial bombing, his future wife Bettina saved the artworks in a spectacular action and brought them to him to Aschaffenburg. An initially provisional arrangement turned into a stay of four decades. Schad continued to paint in the 1950s in the Magic Realist style and would return in the 1960s to experiments with photograms. Schad's reputation did not begin to recover until the 1960s, when a couple of shows in Europe dovetailed with the rise of Photorealism.\n\nSchad died in Stuttgart on February 25, 1982.\n\nSchad's works of 1915–1916 show the influence of Cubism and Futurism. During his stay in Italy he developed a smooth, realistic style that recalls the clarity he admired in the paintings of Raphael. Upon returning to Berlin in 1927 he painted some of the most significant works of the New Objectivity. They are characterized by \"an artistic perception so sharp that it seems to cut beneath the skin\", according to Wieland Schmied, who calls Schad the \"prototypical possessor of the 'cool gaze' which distinguishes this movement from earlier forms of realism\".\n\nIn 1918 Schad began experimenting with cameraless photographic images inspired by Cubism. This process had been first used, in the years 1834 and 1835, by William Henry Fox Talbot who made cameraless images, that is, prints made by placing objects onto photosensitive paper and then exposing the paper to sunlight. By 1919 Schad was creating photograms from random arrangements of discarded objects he had collected such as torn tickets, receipts and rags. He is probably the first to do so strictly as an art form, preceding Man Ray and László Moholy-Nagy by at least a year or two. Photograms created from these arrangements were published in 1920 in the magazine \"Dadaphone\" by Tristan Tzara, who called them 'Schadographs'.\n\nSchad's works are now part of the collections of, among others, the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Tate, London; and the Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin. The first retrospective dedicated to him in the United States was held at the Neue Galerie, New York, in 2003. In 2002 Bettina Schad founded the Christian Schad Foundation in Aschaffenburg. The holdings consist of over 3,200 works, which will be exhibited in a changing selection and in a breadth that is unique worldwide. The Christian Schad Museum in Aschaffenburg will open in 2018.\n\n\n\n"}

The church is known for its YouVersion ministry, which publishes the Bible App.\n\nIn January 1996, Life.Church was founded as Life Covenant Church in Oklahoma City with 40 congregants meeting together in a two-car garage. From 1996 to 1999 the church membership grew rapidly. During this time, Life.Church built its first facility (now known as the \"Oklahoma City Campus\"). \n\nIn 2001, MetroChurch, a 25-year-old, nondenominational church in nearby Edmond, Oklahoma merged with Life.Church, effectively making it a multi-site church. With this merger, they changed their name, combining Life Covenant Church with MetroChurch to arrive at the name \"LifeChurch\", a nod to both previous churches. Their staffs were combined under the leadership of Craig Groeschel as lead pastor. Groeschel said he would be calling on MetroChurch members to help them grow in God. Life Church has had tremendous success in reaching people, but MetroChurch is a proven developer of faith, he said. During these early years of the merger, Craig Groeschel traveled back and forth between the two campuses to deliver his sermons live to the congregations. For a while, this meant he gave five sermons each Sunday, as there were multiple services at both locations. \nFollowing the success of the multi-site services, the church launched campuses in Tulsa and Stillwater, Oklahoma in 2003, with these new campuses incorporating satellite video teaching into their services.\n\nLife.Church opened an additional campus in Oklahoma City, the South Oklahoma City Campus, in Spring 2005. In February 2006, Life.Church introduced a campus in Fort Worth, Texas, its first location outside Oklahoma. In April 2006, the church established its \"Internet Campus\" which broadcasts weekly, interactive worship services live over the internet. \n\nOn Easter Sunday, 2007, Life.Church began broadcasting from their new campus in the online game Second Life. Also in 2007, Life.Church opened campuses in northwest Oklahoma City; Wellington, Florida; and Albany, New York.\n\nIn 2012, the church had more than 26,000 members. \n\nIn 2015, the church had 15 campuses in different American states. \n\nIn 2019, it had 34 campus locations as well as their online church. They also make available past sermons for churches to use as materials in their sermons and bible studies.\n\nIn 2016, Life.Church launched its Life.Church Open Network to provide other churches with resources of digital content and platforms for free.

It comprises the eastern part of Furzedown ward in the London Borough of Wandsworth, formerly in the historic parish of Streatham. It is bounded by Tooting Bec Common to the north, Thrale Road and West Road to the west, and the London to Brighton railway to the east.\n\nThe area takes its name from a Georgian country mansion built by the brewer Ralph Thrale. Streatham Park later passed to Ralph's son Henry Thrale, who with his wife Hester Thrale entertained many of the leading literary and artistic characters of the day, most notably the lexicographer Samuel Johnson, who was fond of a summer house in the grounds.\n\nFormer residents and guests of Streatham Park, or \"Streathamites\", include many notable 18th-century people: Samuel Johnson, David Garrick, Arthur Murphy, Joshua Reynolds, William Seward, James Boswell, Oliver Goldsmith, Giuseppe Marc'Antonio Baretti, Edmund Burke, Edwin Sandys, William Henry Lyttelton, Sir Robert Chambers, Charles Burney and Frances Burney, along with James and Hester Thrale. The dining room contained 12 portraits of Henry's guests painted by Reynolds. These pictures were wittily labelled by Frances Burney as the Streatham Worthies.\n\nStreatham Park was later leased to the Prime Minister Lord Shelburne, and was the venue of the negotiated peace with France in 1783. The Streatham Park mansion was demolished in 1863 and the estate and adjacent fields were laid out for suburban development.\n\nAlthough much of the area was destroyed by bombing in World War II and redeveloped by the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth as council housing in the 1950s, both the avenues of trees of the Georgian estate and much of the Victorian era tree planting survive, and the area is now a conservation area.\n\nThe remaining pre-war buildings include Dixcote (8 North Drive), a rare urban example of a house by the Arts and Crafts architect Charles Voysey.

The town was estimated to have a population of around 255,000 in 2014.\n\n\nThe town began as a military outpost established near a small Shan village with two dozen households on the Lashio-Mandalay trail between Nawnghkio and Mandalay. In 1897, a permanent military post was established in the town and later, because of its climate, it became a hill station and the summer capital of British Burma. The establishment in Burma (civil, commercial and military) would move to Maymyo during the hot season to escape from the high heat and humidity of Rangoon. During British rule and through the 1970s, Maymyo had a large Anglo-Burmese population, but this steadily declined. During the Japanese occupation, as many Anglos were concentrated in and around Maymyo, the Japanese incarcerated many of them for fear of their loyalty to the British very close to Maymyo. Today, Maymyo still has one of the larger populations of Anglo-Burmese in the country. The British named the location Maymyo, literally 'May's Town' in Burmese, after Colonel May, a veteran of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and commander of the Bengal Regiment temporarily stationed in the town in 1887. The military government of Burma renamed the town Pyin U Lwin.\n\nThe area is also the site of the decisive battle of Maymyo where the Burmese royal army under Maha Thiha Thura defeated the Chinese Army in the third invasion during the Sino-Burmese War of 1765–1769.\n\nThe town has approximately 10,000 Indian and 8,000 Gurkha inhabitants who settled in Maymyo during British rule. Today, Pyin Oo Lwin has a thriving Eurasian community, consisting mostly of Anglo-Burmese and Anglo-Indians. There is also a diverse mix of Chinese, Chin, Kachin, Karen, Shan, Bamars (Burmeses) and communities.\n\nMaymyo was an important educational centre during colonial times, with the GEHSs (Government English High Schools), such as St. Mary's, St. Michael's, St. Albert's, St. Joseph's Convent, and Colgate, all based in the town. British settlers and colonial administrators sent their children to be educated here, both European and Anglo-Burmese children. The town was also the location of the various schools of military education open to all ethnicities.\n\nIt is today home to the Defence Services Academy (DSA) and the Defence Services Technological Academy (DSTA). There is a large military presence in the town.\nNowadays private schools such as Soe San, Sar Pan Eain, Genius and others are thriving. The Mandalay Region Private Schools Association is the country's most dynamic and forward looking group in this sector.\nIn the map of HQ Fourteenth Army on March, 1945, there was the Govt Anglo Vernacular school, which is beside the police station. It is near the railway station. You can see the map at the Royal Park View hotel in Pyin Oo Lwin at present(2020).\n\nSweater knitting, flower and vegetable gardens, strawberry and pineapple orchards, coffee plantations and cow rearing are the main local businesses. There has been an influx of Chinese immigrants (especially from Yunnan) in recent years. The city is a resort town for visitors from Myanmar's major cities during the summertime and a popular stop for foreign tourists during the winter season.\n\nEstablished in 1915, the National Botanical Gardens and the adjacent Pyin Oo Lwin Nursery are attractions of Pyin Oo Lwin. A orchid garden is planned for 2007.\n\nToday, Pyin Oo Lwin is noted for four centres of national economic importance. It is the centre of sericulture (silkworm rearing). The Sericulture Research Centre, near the National Kandawgyi Botanical Gardens, has three distinct roles: the intensive planting and harvesting of mulberry trees (leaves for the silk worms, bark for handmade paper), the rearing of silkworms, and the reeling of the silk from the cocoons. It has a large research centre for indigenous medicinal plants. It has one of the country's few pharmaceutical production facilities.\n\nPyin Oo Lwin is the centre of the country's flower and vegetable production. The most important flowers grown intensively are chrysanthemum, aster and gladiolus, which are exported to every corner of Myanmar throughout the year. Lastly, Pyin Oo Lwin is the centre of Myanmar's rapidly growing coffee industry. A number of factories in the town process coffee beans for country-wide distribution, with a growing amount now exported.\n\n\n"}

It is the state's third-largest city and is the municipal seat of the municipality of the same name. \nIt is part of the Tehuantepec District in the west of the Istmo Region.\nThe city had a 2005 census population of 71,314, while its municipality, with an area of had a population of 76,219, the state's fourth-largest municipality in population.\n\nThe port was developed in the late 19th century due to its location at the southern terminus of the Ferrocarril Transístmico, which carried freight across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. \nSalina Cruz is situated near the mouth of the Río Tehuantepec, on the open coast of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Gulf of Tehuantepec, and has no natural harbour. There was only a small Native village before Salina Cruz was chosen as the Pacific terminus of the Tehuantepec National Railway, whereupon a modern town was laid out and built on adjacent higher ground and an artificial harbour was built by the Mexican government to accommodate the expected traffic. \nThe new port was opened to traffic in 1907 and in 1909 its population was largely composed of labourers. The harbour was formed by the construction of two breakwaters, the western and the eastern long, which curve toward each other at their outer extremities and leave an entrance wide. The enclosed space is divided into an outer and inner harbour by a double line of quays wide enough to carry six great warehouses with electric cranes on both sides and a number of railway tracks. Connected with the new port works was one of the then-largest dry docks in the world long and wide, with a depth of on its sill at low water. The works were planned to handle an immense volume of transcontinental freight, and before they were finished four steamship lines had arranged regular calls at Salina Cruz.\n\nAs municipal seat, Salina Cruz has governing jurisdiction over the following communities:\n\nAgua Blanca, Boca del Río, Colonia el Bosque, Colonia el Mirador, Colonia Estibadores, Colonia Granadillo, Colonia la Brecha, Colonia Miramar, Colonia Santita, Colonia Vista Hermosa, El Ciruelo, El Puentecito, Ensenada de la Ventosa, La Brecha (Rancho Moisés Aquino), La Hacienda (Palo Grande), Las Escolleras, Palo Grande, Playa Azul, Playa Brasil (Brasilito), Salinas del Marqués, San Antonio Monterrey, and San José del Palmar\n\nSalina Cruz experiences a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: \"Aw\"). This is because from November to March the precipitation is much smaller, mainly concentrated in summer similar to Asian monsoons, although it is not categorized as such. The seasons of the year can not be well demarcated, generally better defined by the rainy season in the central months of the year. Although precipitation is 1122.3 mm on average, it is usually concentrated in the summer, with August averaging 330.7 mm and February at only 1.6 mm. It is not uncommon for temperatures to rise from 35 °C at some times of the year even in its coastal location. The winter is unknown and at times there is just something like the end of fall to early spring, the lower averages are above 21 °C, moreover no temperature below 10 °C has been recorded as in the Gulf of Mexico. High temperatures are present for much of the year. The hours of sunshine are always well above 200 hours a month, totaling 2670.6 in annual average, which shows a pleasant beach climate.\n\nSalina Cruz features as the focus for the novel \"Last Stop Salina Cruz\" (2007) by British novelist David Lalé. The novel tells the story of a young man following in the footpaths of modernist legend Arthur Cravan across France, Spain, USA, Mexico and finally Salina Cruz.\n\n\n\n"}

It is also used by sculptors.\n\nBefore the 1940s, body solder was often used to repair large imperfections prior to painting. In both new cars and vehicle repair shops. Solder repairs were conducted using a flame and wooden paddles covered in tallow or motor oil, which prevented the half-molten lead from sticking. After the war, automotive panels became thinner and larger, with a greater susceptibility to warping, making hot solder unsuitable. The earliest 'plastic solder' can be traced to around 1940, a do-it-yourself solution to panel beating. \n\nThis gave the consumer the ability to attempt reasonably priced and long lasting repairs. These early fillers were epoxy-based and one part, drying by out gassing. Originally the plastic fillers performed badly compared to solder, but later improvements addressed this. \n\nBondo, a two-part (resin with hardener added) mix of talc and plastic, was introduced in 1955.

{"id": "2116515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116515", "title": "Bade Fateh Ali Khan", "text": "Bade Fateh Ali Khan\n\nUstad Bade Fateh Ali Khan (), \n(1935 – 4 January 2017) was amongst the foremost Khyal vocalists in Pakistan, and a leading exponent of the Patiala Gharana (stylistic lineage). He was the younger of the singing duo Amanat Ali and Fateh Ali, who enjoyed immense prestige and success in Pakistan as well as India, until the sudden and unexpected death of Amanat Ali Khan in 1974 (1922–1974).\n\nFateh Ali was born in the village Shamchaurasi, Hoshiarpur in British India in 1935. Along with his elder brother Amanat Ali, he was trained by their father, Akhtar Hussain Khan, a distinguished vocalist in the patronage of the princely state of Patiala in colonial British India. Their grandfather, Ali Baksh Jarnail, also served the same court. The Patiala Gharana was founded in the mid to the late 19th century by his great-grandfather \"Mian Kallu\" who had received classical music training from the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar’s court musician Mir Qutub Bakhsh Tanrus Khan of Delhi gharana of classical musicians.\n\nThey had a glorious debut in 1945 at Lahore, sponsored by the influential connoisseur, Pandit Jeevanlal Mattoo. Their breakthrough came at the All-Bengal Music Conference in Calcutta in 1949, when Amanat Ali was 27, and Fateh Ali was 14, after which they never looked back. \n\nAmanat Ali – Fateh Ali became celebrities while still in their teens in undivided British India, and achieved their highest official recognition, when the President of Pakistan conferred on them the Pride of Performance Medal in 1969. The \"Bade\" (elder) prefix got attached to Fateh Ali's name, after younger Pakistani musicians with similar names, started making waves with an entirely different genre of music.\n\nLife changed dramatically for the budding stars when India was partitioned in 1947, and the family opted to migrate to Pakistan. Overcoming destitution in their new home, the duo swung back, while still in their teens, to earn their rightful place amongst the foremost vocalists of the subcontinent. Fateh Ali was dealt a devastating blow with the demise of his brother Amanat Ali in 1974. Fateh Ali is reported to have suffered a deep depression for over a year and a half, following which he joined Radio Pakistan as a supervisor.\n\nThe two brothers as a duo had neatly divided their singing by specialisation. Amanat Ali Khan had a gifted voice and he embellished his singing in broad sweeps by 'lagao', and blossoming out in the upper register while Fateh Ali engaged in intricacies of the countless 'behlawas' and complex taans, in a much lower and gravelly voice, respectively drawing inspiration from two elders of their gharana, Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Ustad Ashiq Ali Khan.\n\nFateh Ali was urged to restart his performing career, but would break into tears when first beginning to sing. Bade Fateh Ali Khan eventually overcame this emotional block, and started singing as a duo with his younger brother Hamid Ali Khan, as well his nephews, Asad Amanat Ali Khan (1952–2007) or Amjad Amanat Ali Khan who are both sons of his late brother Amanat Ali Khan. The absence of Amanat Ali made Fateh Ali redevelop and re-align his singing style. He had to fill the void left by Amanat Ali in the middle of his career, which was not an easy thing to do. The void was only partly filled by Amjad Amanat Ali Khan and Asad Amanat Ali Khan, as these two have occupied a relatively junior role in comparison with the almost equal footing that Amanat Ali and Fateh Ali fulfilled as a duo.\n\nThough trained also in the medieval Dhrupad genre, the uncle-nephew duo restricts its repertoire to the modern mainstream genre, Khayal, and the romanticist genres, Thumris, Dadra, and Ghazal. The pair had, since their alliance, performed widely in Europe, North America, the Middle East, and South Asia, and released several recordings. One highly unusual CD released in 1992 on the ECM label is entitled \"Ragas and Sagas\", which is a collaboration with Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek. Fateh Ali has performed all over the world and has many students internationally. One of his favourite students was Deeyah from Norway. She is originally half Afghan and half Pakistani. She was born in Norway. And now she is in UK and have become an Emmy Award winner film maker.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the Patiala style of Khayal vocalism has been represented by two streams of the gharana. One stream, gave the music world the Amanat Ali Khan and Bade Fateh Ali Khan duo. The other stream, through its training of Patiala-Kasur gharana vocalists, produced Bade Ghulam Ali Khan (1903–1968), his brother Barkat Ali Khan (1907–1963), and the former's son, Munawar Ali Khan (1933–1989). With the stylistic distinctiveness and continuity of Khayal gharanas having fallen prey to socio-cultural changes on both sides of the India-Pakistan border, Bade Fateh Ali Khan is the last of the thoroughbred Patiala Gharana vocalists.\n\nOn Bade Fateh Ali Khan's death, his younger brother Hamid Ali Khan called him like a father figure for his family and also his teacher who taught him everything he knows about classical music.\n\nHis disciple, Ahmad Wali of Afghanistan, had shown such talent at a young age that Ustad bestowed upon Ahmad Wali his own name thus calling him \"Ahmad Wali Fateh Ali Khan\". Ahmad Wali Fateh Ali Khan was born in 1987 and was first taught by his father and other masters (teachers) in the Patiala Gharana made famous by Ustad Mohammad Hussain Sarahang and now Wali Fateh Ali Khan is a popular vocalist in Afghanistan. The famous nohakhawan \"Haider Rizvi Alhussaini\" was also a student of the great Bade Fateh Ali Khan. In 2016, he teaches classical music classes at Pakistan National Council of Arts (PNCA) in Islamabad as he has gotten older.\n\nUstad Fateh Ali Khan's signature vocal style has influenced many singers around the world, including classical vocal prodigy, Shyam Panchmatia, about whom the Ustad said, \"we are fortunate that such young talent exists around the world; the future of our music is safe in their hands.\" Shyam's exposition of Raag Megh from the Patiala Gharana has been featured on the BBC after being performed internationally.\n\nOther notable students include Ustad Amanat Ali Khan's son, Shafqat Amanat Ali, who has brought attention to several compositions penned by Ustad Fateh Ali Khan and his brother by arranging the background score in a popular style.\n\nBade Fateh Ali Khan suffered lung disease in the last week of December 2016. He was admitted to a hospital and died at the age of 82 on 4 January 2017.\n\nIn March 2017, a \"Musical Tribute Event\" to honor him was held at Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi.\n\nOn his death, a major Pakistani English language newspaper commented, \"Ustad Fateh Ali Khan, a distinguished classical singer and one of the most celebrated vocalists belonging to the Patiala Gharana of classical music, died in Islamabad on Wednesday.

Known as Boston's \"Ice King\", he was the founder of the Tudor Ice Company and a pioneer of the international ice trade in the early 19th century. He made a fortune shipping ice cut from New England ponds to ports in the Caribbean, Europe, and as far away as India and Hong Kong.\n\nTudor was the third son of William Tudor, a wealthy Boston lawyer, and Delia Jarvis Tudor. Although his older brother William Tudor (1779–1830) would become one of Boston's leading literary figures, Tudor spurned the chance to be educated at Harvard and from the age of 13 occupied himself with business. After a visit to the Caribbean, he decided he could make a fortune exporting ice from the ponds of Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1806 (age 23), Tudor bought his first brig, \"Favorite\", to carry ice cut from his father's farm in Saugus from Charlestown to Martinique. It left dock on February 10, 1806, to the following report in the Boston Gazette: \"No joke. A vessel has cleared at the Custom House for Martinique with a cargo of ice. We hope this will not prove a slippery speculation.\"<ref name=\"bbc18/2/2015\">This is the chilling story of men who changed the planet forever - by dropping the temperature.</ref> While he secured a cargo of ice, a vessel in which to ship it, and formulated his plan of attack, he sent his brother William and his cousin, James Savage, ahead to obtain a monopoly from the various governments of the islands. \"We wish you to procure from the gov' of Cuba a grant exclusive in which we offer you either to take a conces' of half or procure the privilege for us & we engage to pay you one thousand dollars with reasonable charges, in obtaining it you, however, to determine which you will do & write to that effect as early as possible.\" Although a considerable amount of the ice melted during the three-week journey south, he did manage to sell much of what remained on board for a loss of $4500 overall. However, in the subsequent year, Tudor had severe financial losses when three shipments to Havana in the brig \"Trident\" also resulted in a loss.\n\nA few factors were in Tudor's favor. Hiring ships was cheap because many left Boston empty to collect cargo later in the West Indies. Ice was free, only the labor of cutting it needed payment. Sawdust was also free as a waste product of the lumber industry, and insulated ice effectively.\nTudor had his first profits in 1810 when his gross sales amounted to about $7400, then increasing to just short of $9000; but of that, he only received $1000 due to the \"villainous conduct\" of his agent. At this point, his personal debts far outweighed his income and he spent parts of 1812 and 1813 in debtor's prison. By 1815, however, he had managed to borrow $2100, both to buy ice and to pay for a new ice-house in Havana. It was a double-shelled structure, twenty-five feet square on its outside dimension, nineteen feet square on the interior, and sixteen feet high, holding some 150 tons of ice. \"Pursued by sheriffs to the very wharf,\" in Boston, Tudor set sail for Havana on November 1, 1815.\n\nBy 1816, Tudor was shipping ice from Massachusetts to Cuba with ever-increasing efficiency and decided to try his hand at importing Cuban fruit to New York. In August of that year, he borrowed $3000 (at 40% interest) for a shipload of limes, oranges, bananas, and pears, preserving it with 15 tons of ice and 3 tons of hay. The experiment ended in disaster as virtually all the fruit rotted during the month-long voyage, leaving Tudor with several thousand dollars' worth of new debt. Still, he pressed on, opening up new markets in three southern U.S. cities (Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and New Orleans, Louisiana).\n\nTudor spent the next few years experimenting with various kinds of insulation. Ice was packed aboard ship with wood shavings, sawdust, or rice chaff on its outside surfaces to insulate it against heat. The blocks were also stacked together like well-fitted masonry. He constructed icehouses throughout the tropics and created a demand there for cold refreshments.\n\nBy 1825, Tudor was doing well with ice sales, but the difficulty of hand-cutting large blocks limited his company's growth. However, one supplier, Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth, harnessed horses to a metal blade to cut ice. Wyeth's ice plow made mass production a reality and allowed Tudor to more than triple his production.\n\nIn 1833, fellow Boston-based merchant Samuel Austin proposed a partnership for selling ice to India, then some and four months away from Massachusetts. On May 12, 1833 the brig \"Tuscany\" sailed from Boston for Calcutta, its hold filled with 180 tons of ice cut during the winter. When it approached the Ganges in September 1833, many believed the delivery was an elaborate joke, but the ship still had 100 tons of ice upon arrival. Over the next 20 years, Calcutta would become Tudor's most lucrative destination, yielding an estimated $220,000 in profits. Tudor had three ice houses built in India for storage, in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras. When Tudor's India business collapsed as a result of the invention of making ice by the stream process, the icehouse in Madras was sold, and remodeled to become the Vivekanandar Illam.\n\nIn the early 1830s, Tudor had also begun to speculate in coffee futures with his ice business as collateral. Initially, coffee prices did rise and Tudor made millions of dollars, but in 1834, Tudor fell more than a quarter-million dollars in debt, forcing him to re-focus on the ice trade. By the end of the year, Tudor wrote that 1834 had been unsatisfactory in all but one aspect – that of his marriage to a girl 30 years his junior.\n\nIn the summer of 1833, at the age of 50, Frederic had turned his attentions to 19-year-old Euphemia Fenno, who met him while she was visiting Boston from Mount Upton, New York. He began writing to her regularly, with the result that Frederic and Euphemia were married on January 2, 1834. The couple went on to have six children. By then the ice business had expanded from New York up through Maine.\n\nThe horse-drawn Charlestown Branch Railroad expanded to connect the Fresh Pond icehouses of Tudor, Addison Gage, and Nathaniel J. Wyeth with several wharves in Charlestown. With the first ice shipment in December 1841, it made the process of transporting ice to ships considerably more efficient. By the 1840s, ice was being shipped all over the world; in 1845 an ice house was opened in Hong Kong, although it only remained open until 1850. Although Tudor was now just a small part of the trade, his profits allowed him to pay off his debts and resume living a comfortable existence.\n\nFrederic ( The Ice King) had a great personality. He was very caring for people and Tudor also had changed many things with his sled with blades that he had made when he was about 22.\n\nThe Tudors belonged to a prominent Boston Brahmin family, and Frederic inherited his family's grounds in Nahant, Massachusetts. In 1825, after constructing his summer cottage in the center of town, he began a lifelong campaign to plant trees on treeless Nahant. By 1832 he had 3,358 trees growing in his nursery and within two years he had some 4,000 trees in cultivation, offering them to summer residents for free if they would plant them on their properties. The family grounds are now the Nahant Country Club.\n\nFrederic married Euphemia Fenno (April 6, 1814, Mount Upton, New York– March 9, 1884, Newbury, Vermont). His oldest son, Frederic (February 11, 1845 – Boston 1902), was an 1867 graduate of Harvard College and a member of one of the first graduating classes at St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire). The Ice King's second son, William, was also a graduate of St. Paul's School.\n\nThe younger Frederic was the grandfather of the 20th-century watercolorist and book illustrator Tasha Tudor (Frederic's daughter Rosamond married William Starling Burgess). She was born in Boston in 1915 and was named Starling Burgess for her father. She styled herself as Tasha Tudor and published under that name.\n\nFrederic Tudor died in Boston at his house on the northwest corner of Beacon and Joy Streets on Saturday, February 6, 1864. He was buried in the King's Chapel cemetery on Tremont Street in the Tudor family tomb (number thirteen), but his remains may later have been moved.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2116548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116548", "title": "Shakespeare's Globe", "text": "Shakespeare's Globe\n\nShakespeare's Globe is a reconstruction of the Globe Theatre, an Elizabethan playhouse for which William Shakespeare wrote his plays, in the London Borough of Southwark, on the south bank of the River Thames. The original theatre was built in 1599, destroyed by fire in 1613, rebuilt in 1614, and then demolished in 1644. The modern Globe Theatre is an academic approximation based on available evidence of the 1599 and 1614 buildings. It is considered quite realistic, though modern safety requirements mean that it accommodates only 1,400 spectators compared to the original theatre's 3,000.\n\nShakespeare's Globe was founded by the actor and director Sam Wanamaker, built about from the site of the original theatre and opened to the public in 1997, with a production of \"Henry V\". The site also includes the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, an indoor theatre which opened in January 2014. This is a smaller, candle-lit space based on the indoor playhouses of Jacobean London. The Sackler Studios, an educational and rehearsal studio complex, is situated just around the corner from the main site.\n\nMichelle Terry currently serves as artistic director. She is the second actor-manager in charge of the organisation, following Mark Rylance, the founding artistic director.\n\nIn 1970, American actor and director Sam Wanamaker founded the Shakespeare Globe Trust and the International Shakespeare Globe Centre, with the objective of building a faithful recreation of Shakespeare's Globe close to its original location at Bankside, Southwark. This inspired the founding of a number of Shakespeare's Globe Centres around the world, an activity in which Wanamaker also participated.\n\nMany people maintained that a faithful Globe reconstruction was impossible to achieve due to the complications in the 16th-century design and modern fire safety requirements; however, Wanamaker persevered in his vision for over 20 years and a new Globe theatre was eventually built according to a design based on the research of historical adviser John Orrell.\n\nIt was Wanamaker's wish that the new building recreate the Globe as it existed during most of Shakespeare's time there; that is, the 1599 building rather than its 1614 replacement. A study was made of what was known of the construction of The Theatre, the building from which the 1599 Globe obtained much of its timber, as a starting point for the modern building's design. To this were added: examinations of other surviving London buildings from the latter part of the 16th century; comparisons with other theatres of the period (particularly the Fortune Playhouse, for which the building contract survives); and contemporary drawings and descriptions of the first Globe. For practical reasons, some features of the 1614 rebuilding were incorporated into the modern design, such as the external staircases. The design team consisted of architect Theo Crosby of Pentagram, structural and services engineer Buro Happold, and quantity surveyors from Boyden & Co. The construction, building research and historic design details were undertaken by McCurdy & Co.\n\nIn 1994, the name \"Globe Theatre\" was used by one of the theatres in Shaftesbury Avenue; to make the name available and to avoid confusion, that year it was renamed as the Gielgud Theatre.\n\nThe theatre opened in 1997 under the name \"Shakespeare's Globe Theatre\", and has staged plays every summer. Mark Rylance became the first artistic director in 1995 and was succeeded by Dominic Dromgoole in 2006. In January 2016, Emma Rice began her term as the Globe's third artistic director, but in October 2016 announced her decision to resign from the position in April 2018. On 24 July 2017 her successor was announced to be the actor and writer Michelle Terry.\n\nThe theatre is located on Bankside, about from the original site—measured from centre to centre. The Thames was much wider in Shakespeare's time and the original Globe was on the riverbank, though that site is now far from the river, and the river-side site for the reconstructed Globe was chosen to recreate the atmosphere of the original theatre. In addition, listed Georgian townhouses now occupy part of the original site and could not be considered for removal. Like the original Globe, the modern theatre has a thrust stage that projects into a large circular yard surrounded by three tiers of raked seating. The only covered parts of the amphitheatre are the stage and the seating areas. Plays are staged during the summer, usually between May and the first week of October; in the winter, the theatre is used for educational purposes. Tours are available all year round. Some productions are filmed and released to cinemas as Globe on Screen productions (usually in the year following the live production), and on DVD.\n\nThe reconstruction was carefully researched so that the new building would be as faithful a replica of the original as possible. This was aided by the discovery of the remains of the original Rose Theatre, a nearby neighbour to the Globe, as final plans were being made for the site and structure.\n\nThe building itself is constructed entirely of English oak, with mortise and tenon joints and is, in this sense, an \"authentic\" 16th-century timber-framed building as no structural steel was used. The seats are simple benches (though cushions can be hired for performances) and the Globe has the first and only thatched roof permitted in London since the Great Fire of 1666. The modern thatch is well protected by fire retardants, and sprinklers on the roof ensure further protection against fire. The pit has a concrete surface, as opposed to earthen-ground covered with strewn rush from the original theatre. The theatre has extensive backstage support areas for actors and musicians, and is attached to a modern lobby, restaurant, gift shop and visitor centre. Seating capacity is 873 with an additional 700 \"Groundlings\" standing in the yard, making up an audience about half the size of a typical audience in Shakespeare's time.\n\nFor its first 18 seasons, performances were engineered to duplicate the original environment of Shakespeare's Globe; there were no spotlights, and plays were staged during daylight hours and in the evenings (with the help of interior floodlights), there were no microphones, speakers or amplification. All music was performed live, most often on period instruments; and the actors and the audience could see and interact easily with each other, adding to the feeling of a shared experience and of a community event.\n\nTypically, performances have been created in the spirit of experimentation to explore the original playing conditions of the 1599 Globe. Modern and conventional theatre technology such as spotlights and microphones were not used during this period. Beginning in the 2016 season, the new artistic director, Emma Rice, began experimenting with the theatre space by installing a temporary lighting and sound rig. The current artistic director, Michelle Terry, has brought back the experimentation on original playing conditions.\n\nThe Globe operates without any public subsidy and generates £24 million in revenue per year.\n\nAdjacent to the Globe is the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, an indoor theatre modelled after a Jacobean-era theatre and used for performances during the winter months when the main theatre cannot be used.\n\n\"Read Not Dead\" is a series of play readings, or staged \"performances with scripts\" that have been presented as part of the educational programme of Shakespeare's Globe since 1995. The plays selected are those that were written between 1576 and 1642 by Shakespeare's contemporaries or near contemporaries. These readings are performed at Shakespeare's Globe Sackler Studios as well as other theatres, halls, festivals and fields nationwide.\n\nIn 2013 there were \"Read Not Dead\" performances at the Wilderness Festival and at the Glastonbury Festival. In 2014, the final production in \"Read not Dead's\" first season was performed at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, which is the indoor Jacobean style theatre. The play selected for that occasion was Robert Daborne’s \"A Christian Turn'd Turk\".\n\nThe Globe's productions are often screened in cinemas and released on DVD. In 2015, the venue launched Globe Player, a video-on-demand service enabling viewers to watch the plays on laptops and mobile devices. The theatre was the first in the world to make its plays available as video-on-demand.\n\nReplicas and free interpretations of the Globe have been built around the world:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nim just saying even though you just read this article doesn't mean its completely true see how easy it is for me to just type on here keep this in mind next time you need to do a projected\n"}

The ends can be knotted, taped or lightly sewn to the standing parts to help prevent them from creeping back into the knot.\n\nThe knot can be used for joining flat materials such as leather or tape.\n\nOnce tied, for additional security each end should be tied in a double overhand stopper knot around the other standing end.\n\nSome testing has shown that the water knot, in certain conditions, can slip very slightly but very consistently, with cyclic loading & unloading at relatively low forces; it is the tail on the exterior\nthat slips (this would be the blue tail in the image presented here). In tests using 9/16 in (14.3 mm) tubular nylon webbing, repeated loading and unloading with 250 lbs (113 kg) caused one of the 3 in (76 mm) tails to work back into the knot in just over 800 loading cycles. Another test showed similar results for Spectra tape (but not for new, 1 inch tubular nylon). And yet the knot can be loaded to rupture without slippage. These results validate the need to leave adequate tails and inspect water knots before each use. With single overhand knot safeties on either end, the combination eventually seized and the slipping stopped.\n\nAlthough used extensively in climbing and caving, there is some opinion that the water knot is unsafe. According to Walter Siebert, several deaths have been reported due to failure of this knot (although, as in many failed-knot cases, the actual mechanism of failure is unknown, and only conjecture can be inferred). He demonstrates in a video how easily the knot can pull loose if snagged. Siebert references an article from Pit Schubert in 1995 that details many deaths investigated where the water knot was used with webbing and failed. Schubert drew the conclusion after reviewing the remaining webbing and the sites where these falls took place that the knot can open if it catches on an edge or any protrusion. \n\nIn Germany, the knot is sometimes called \"Todesknoten\", which means death knot.\n\nThe Figure-8 Water Knot (or Figure 8 Bend or Flemish Bend) is based upon a figure-8 (or Flemish) knot instead of an overhand knot. It is easier to untie.\n\n"}

The sit-in campaign, coordinated by the Nashville Student Movement and the Nashville Christian Leadership Council, was notable for its early success and its emphasis on disciplined nonviolence. It was part of a broader sit-in movement that spread across the southern United States in the wake of the Greensboro sit-ins in North Carolina.\n\nOver the course of the Nashville sit-in campaign, sit-ins were staged at numerous stores in the central business district. Sit-in participants, who mainly consisted of black college students, were often verbally or physically attacked by white onlookers. Despite their refusal to retaliate, over 150 students were eventually arrested for refusing to vacate store lunch counters when ordered to do so by police. At trial, the students were represented by a group of 13 lawyers, headed by Z. Alexander Looby. On April 19, Looby's home was bombed, although he escaped uninjured. Later that day, at least 3,000 people marched to City Hall to confront Mayor Ben West about the escalating violence. When asked if he believed the lunch counters in Nashville should be desegregated, West agreed that they should. After subsequent negotiations between the store owners and protest leaders, an agreement was reached during the first week of May. On May 10, six downtown stores began serving black customers at their lunch counters for the first time.\n\nAlthough the initial campaign successfully desegregated downtown lunch counters, sit-ins, pickets, and protests against other segregated facilities continued in Nashville until passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which ended overt, legally sanctioned segregation nationwide. Many of the organizers of the Nashville sit-ins went on to become important leaders in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nIn 1896, the United States Supreme Court decision \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation under the doctrine of \"separate but equal\". This decision led to the proliferation of Jim Crow laws throughout the United States. These laws mandated or explicitly allowed segregation in virtually all spheres of public life and allowed racial discrimination to flourish across the country, especially in the southern United States.\n\nIn Nashville, like most Southern cities, African Americans were severely disadvantaged under the system of Jim Crow segregation. Besides being relegated to underfunded schools and barred from numerous public accommodations, African Americans had few prospects for skilled employment and were subject to constant discrimination from the white majority.\n\nAlthough serious efforts were made to oppose Jim Crow laws in Nashville as early as 1905, it was not until 1958, with the formation of the Nashville Christian Leadership Council, that Nashville's African American community would lay the foundation for dismantling racial segregation.\n\nThe Nashville Christian Leadership Council (or NCLC), was founded by the Reverend Kelly Miller Smith, pastor of First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill. This organization was an affiliate of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was established to promote civil rights for African Americans through nonviolent civil disobedience. Smith believed that White Americans would be more sympathetic to desegregation if African Americans obtained their rights through peaceful demonstration rather than through the judicial system or violent confrontation.\n\nFrom March 26 to 28, 1958, the NCLC held the first of many workshops on using nonviolent tactics to challenge segregation. These workshops were led by James Lawson, who had studied the principles of nonviolent resistance while working as a missionary in India. The workshops were mainly attended by students from Fisk University, Tennessee A&I (later Tennessee State University), American Baptist Theological Seminary (later American Baptist College), and Meharry Medical College. Among those attending Lawson's sessions were students who would become significant leaders in the Civil Rights Movement, among them: Marion Barry, James Bevel, Bernard Lafayette, John Lewis, Diane Nash, and C. T. Vivian.\n\nDuring these workshops it was decided that the first target for the group's actions would be downtown lunch counters. At the time, African Americans were allowed to shop in downtown stores but were not allowed to eat in the stores' restaurants. The group felt that the lunch counters were a good objective because they were highly visible, easily accessible, and provided a stark example of the injustices black Southerners faced every day.\n\nIn late 1959, James Lawson and other members of the NCLC's projects committee met with department store owners Fred Harvey and John Sloan, and asked them to voluntarily serve African Americans at their lunch counters. Both men declined, saying that they would lose more business than they would gain. The students then began doing reconnaissance for sit-in demonstrations. The first test took place at Harveys Department Store in downtown Nashville on November 28, followed by the Cain-Sloan store on December 5. Small groups of students purchased items at the stores and then sat at their lunch counters and attempted to order food. Their goal was to try to sense the mood and degree of resistance in each store. Although they were refused service at both lunch counters, the reactions varied significantly. At Harveys, they received surprisingly polite responses, while at Cain-Sloan they were treated with contempt. These reconnaissance actions were low-key and neither of the city's newspapers was notified of them.\n\nBefore the students in Nashville had a chance to formalize their plans, events elsewhere brought renewed urgency to the effort. During the first week of February 1960, a small sit-in demonstration in Greensboro, North Carolina, grew into a significant protest with over eighty students participating by the third day. Although similar demonstrations had occurred previously in other cities, this was the first to attract substantial media attention and public notice. When Lawson's group met the subsequent Friday night, about 500 new volunteers showed up to join the cause. Although Lawson and other adult organizers argued for delay, the student leaders insisted that the time had come for action.\nThe first large-scale organized sit-in was on Saturday, February 13, 1960. At about 12:30 pm, 124 students, most of them black, walked into the downtown Woolworths, S. H. Kress, and McLellan stores and asked to be served at the lunch counters. After the staff refused to serve them, they sat in the stores for two hours and then left without incident.\n\nOn the Monday following the first sit-in, the Baptist Minister's Conference of Nashville, representing 79 congregations, unanimously voted to support the student movement, thus throwing the weight of Nashville's black religious community behind the students. Local religious leaders called on people of good will to boycott downtown merchants who practiced segregation. Nashville's black community strongly supported the boycott, causing economic hardship for the merchants.\n\nThe second sit-in occurred on Thursday, February 18, when more than 200 students entered Woolworths, S. H. Kress, McClellan, and Grants. The lunch counters were immediately closed. The students remained for about half an hour and then left, again without incident. The third sit-in occurred on February 20 when about 350 students entered the previous four stores and the downtown Walgreens drugstore. As the students sat at the counters, crowds of white youths gathered in several of the stores. Police kept a watchful eye on all five locations, but no incidents of violence occurred. The students remained for nearly three hours until adjourning to a mass meeting at the First Baptist Church.\nTensions mounted over the following week as sit-in demonstrations spread to other cities and race riots broke out in nearby Chattanooga. On February 27, the Nashville student activists held a fourth sit-in at the Woolworths, McClellan, and Walgreens stores. Crowds of white youths again gathered in the stores to taunt and harass the demonstrators. This time, however, police were not present. Eventually, several of the sit-in demonstrators were attacked by hecklers in the McClellan and Woolworths stores. Some were pulled from their seats and beaten, and one demonstrator was pushed down a flight of stairs. When police arrived, the white attackers fled and none were arrested. Police then ordered the demonstrators at all three locations to leave the stores. When the demonstrators refused to leave, they were arrested and loaded into police vehicles as onlookers applauded. Eighty-one students were arrested and charged with loitering and disorderly conduct.\n\nThe arrests brought a surge of media coverage to the sit-in campaign, including national television news coverage, front page stories in both of Nashville's daily newspapers, and an Associated Press story. The students generally viewed any media coverage as helpful to their cause, especially when it illustrated their commitment to nonviolence.\n\nSeveral other sit-ins took place over the following two months, resulting in more arrests and further attacks against sit-in participants. Over 150 students were arrested. Throughout the demonstrations, the student activists maintained a policy of disciplined nonviolence. Their written code of conduct became a model followed by demonstrators in other cities:\n\n\"Do not strike back or curse if abused. Do not laugh out. Do not hold conversations with the floor walker. Do not leave your seat until your leader has given you permission to do so. Do not block entrances to stores outside nor the aisles inside. Do show yourself courteous and friendly at all times. Do sit straight; always face the counter. Do report all serious incidents to your leader. Do refer information seekers to your leader in a polite manner. Remember the teachings of Jesus, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. Love and nonviolence is the way.\"\nThe trials of the sit-in participants attracted widespread interest throughout Nashville and the surrounding region. On February 29, the first day of the trials, a crowd of more than 2000 people lined the streets surrounding the city courthouse to show their support for the defendants. A group of 13 lawyers, headed by Z. Alexander Looby, represented the students. Initially, the trial was presided over by City Judge Andrew J. Doyle. Doyle dismissed the loitering charges against the students and then stepped down from the bench, turning the trial over to Special City Judge John I. Harris.\n\nDespite strong support from the black community, all the students who had been arrested were convicted of disorderly conduct and fined $50. The students refused to pay the fines, however, and chose instead to serve thirty-three days in the county workhouse. Diane Nash issued a statement on behalf of the students explaining the decision: \"We feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants.\"\n\nThe same day the trials began, a group of black ministers, including James Lawson, met with Mayor Ben West to discuss the sit-ins. Coverage of the meeting by the local press, including a scathing editorial in the \"Nashville Banner\" denouncing Lawson as a \"flannel-mouth agitator\", brought Lawson's activities to the attention of Vanderbilt University where he was enrolled as a Divinity School student. The newspaper was owned by James G. Stahlman, a Vanderbilt trustee who was \"strongly anti-integration\"; it published misleading stories, including the suggestion that Lawson had incited others to \"violate the law.\" When Lawson was confronted by Vanderbilt's executive committee and told he would have to end his involvement with the sit-ins, Lawson refused. He was immediately expelled from the university by Chancellor Harvie Branscomb, and arrested the next day. Dean J. Robert Nelson resigned in protest and paid Lawson's bail with three of his colleagues, and the school was placed on probation for a year by the American Association of Theological Schools.\n\nOn March 3, in an effort to defuse the racial tensions caused by the sit-ins, Mayor West announced the formation of a Biracial Committee to seek a solution to the city's racial strife. The committee included the presidents of two of the city's black universities, but did not include any representatives from the student movement. The committee met several times over the next month and delivered its recommendations in a report on April 5. The committee recommended to partially integrate the city's lunch counters. Each store would have one section that was for whites only and another section for whites and blacks. This solution was rejected by the student leaders, who considered the recommendations to be morally unacceptable and based upon a policy of segregation. Less than a week after the Biracial Committee issued its report, the sit-ins resumed and the boycott of downtown businesses was intensified.\n\nAt 5:30 am on April 19, dynamite was thrown through a front window of Z. Alexander Looby's home in north Nashville, apparently in retaliation for his support of the demonstrators. Although the explosion almost destroyed the house, Looby and his wife, who were asleep in a back bedroom, were not injured. More than 140 windows in a nearby dormitory were broken by the blast.\n\nRather than discouraging the protesters, this event served as a catalyst for the movement. Within hours, news of the bombing had spread throughout the community. Around noon, nearly 4000 people marched silently to City Hall to confront the mayor. Mayor West met the marchers at the courthouse steps. Reverend C. T. Vivian read a prepared statement accusing the mayor of ignoring the moral issues involved in segregation and turning a blind eye to violence and injustice. Diane Nash then asked the mayor if he felt it was wrong to discriminate against a person based solely on their race or skin color. West answered that he agreed it was wrong. Nash then asked him if he believed that lunch counters in the city should be desegregated. West answered, \"Yes\", then added, \"That's up to the store managers, of course.\"\n\nCoverage of this event varied significantly between Nashville's two major newspapers. \"The Tennessean\" emphasized the mayor's agreement that lunch counters should be desegregated, while the \"Nashville Banner\" emphasized the mayor's statement that it was up to the city's merchants to decide whether to desegregate. This was largely indicative of the two papers' opposing stances on the issue. Regardless, the mayor's response was later cited as an important turning point by both activists and Nashville business owners.\n\nThe day after the bombing Martin Luther King, Jr. came to Nashville to speak at Fisk University. During the speech, he praised the Nashville sit-in movement as \"the best organized and the most disciplined in the Southland.\" He further stated that he came to Nashville \"not to bring inspiration but to gain inspiration from the great movement that has taken place in this community.\"\n\nAfter weeks of secret negotiations between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached during the first week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.\n\nOn May 10, six downtown stores opened their lunch counters to black customers for the first time. The customers arrived in groups of two or three during the afternoon and were served without incident. At the same time, African Americans ended their six-week-old boycott of the downtown stores. The plan continued successfully and the lunch counters were integrated without any further incidents of violence. Nashville thus became the first major city in the southern United States to begin desegregating its public facilities.\n\nAlthough the end of the sit-in campaign brought a brief respite for civil rights activists in Nashville, institutionalized racism remained a problem throughout the city. Over the next few years, further sit-ins, pickets, and other actions would take place at restaurants, movie theaters, public swimming pools, and other segregated facilities across Nashville. These actions continued until Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited segregation in public places throughout the United States. In that year, many of the key figures of the sit-ins, including James Lawson and Kelly Miller Smith, were interviewed by Robert Penn Warren for his book \"Who Speaks for the Negro?\", in which they reflected on their experiences.\n\nSeveral events were held in 2010 in order to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Nashville sit-ins. \n\n\n"}

It was first recorded by Frankie Laine in 1963 and released as a single on Columbia Records. However, the song did not become a major hit until 1964, when Gene Pitney released his version as a single. It was also a single released by the 1980 band Blue Angel, with lead vocals provided by future star Cyndi Lauper. This release was prior to Lauper's solo career; however, Lauper re-recorded the track and released it as a single in 1994. The song was also featured on 1982's \"Quiet Lies\" album by Grammy winner Juice Newton. Though Newton never released the song as a single, her remake was later added as a bonus track to her first \"Greatest Hits\" collection.\n\nThis version became a top ten hit on both the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. The song is Pitney's biggest UK solo hit, with only his duet version of \"Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart\" with Marc Almond peaking higher.\n\nIt was also the most successful single released by the 1980 band Blue Angel from their album also called \"Blue Angel\". The vocals were provided by Cyndi Lauper. Like the album, the only country the single charted in was the Netherlands, where it reached #37 on the charts.\n\nThe artwork and track listing for the single varied depending on the country of origin.

This single was not commercially released in the US where it was only released as a promo.\n\nDavid Bauder from \"Associated Press\" said \"it's among her strongest vocal performances\". \"Cox News Service\" noted that Lauper \"still owns one of the most wide-ranging and dynamic voices in pop music.\" Ian Tasker from \"The Guardian\" wrote that Lauper's voice is \"arguably best displayed\" on the 1994 single \"I'm Gonna Be Strong\". He added that the song is \"a highly emotional song of a relationship breaking down, it's unusual in as much as it doesn't really have a chorus – it just builds and builds, adding layer upon layer of pain and hurt as Lauper's majestic voice grows stronger and more insistent, higher and higher until it reaches a heartbreaking climax.\" Gerald Martinez from \"New Straits Times\" described the song as a \"broadway style ballad\".

The episode was originally broadcast in the United States on May 17, 2001 on The WB. It was written by Brad Kern and directed by Shannen Doherty. As well as being Doherty's last episode as director, it was also her last appearance on the show as the character Prue Halliwell, although the character would later return in the . In the episode, The Charmed Ones deal with their secret of being witches going global and all of the news reporters swarming them.\n\n\"Charmed\" focuses on the three Halliwell sisters, Prue (Shannen Doherty), Piper (Holly Marie Combs) and Phoebe (Alyssa Milano), who are known as the most powerful good witches of all time in the supernatural community. They live their everyday lives battling demons and warlocks in modern-day San Francisco, while still trying to have a normal life. This episode focuses on their secret of being witches coming out into the public, when Prue and Piper are caught on tape vanquishing the demon Shax (Michael Bailey Smith).\n\nPrue, Piper and Phoebe rush into the manor with Dr. Griffiths (Matt Malloy), and they argue that Phoebe did not give them enough time to figure out why Shax, the personal assassin of The Source of All Evil, is after Dr. Griffiths. Phoebe goes up to the attic to the \"Book of Shadows\" to find out more information about Shax, and Piper tells her not to get side tracked by saving her demon boyfriend Cole (Julian McMahon). While Prue is explaining what is happening to Dr. Griffiths, she feels a slight breeze, and Shax rushes in the form of a tornado. Just as he is about to attack Dr. Griffiths, Prue jumps in the way and is thrown into a wall by a gust of wind. When Piper gets up, she is then thrown into the same wall, and Phoebe comes rushing down the stairs and says the vanquishing spell which wounds Shax. She then calls for Leo who orbs in and heals Prue and Piper just in time. Prue and Piper then go into the streets to figure out where Shax went. While talking in the middle of the street, Shax appears and attacks the two of them, but Piper blows him up. Thinking he is dead, both Prue and Piper are confused because if there is a spell in the book, they normally need it. But what Prue and Piper do not realize is that there was a camera crew, filming for the news, and they caught it all on tape. Back at the manor, Prue and Phoebe explain everything to Dr. Griffiths about magic, and why he needs to keep their secret, and he promises that he will keep it safe, since they saved his life. Prue is still very suspicious about how Shax died, though Piper tells her that he went poof and screamed which is how most demons die. Since Prue still worries, she sends Leo (Brian Krause) to The Elders to find out if they vanquished Shax for good. Phoebe then confesses that she is going to The Underworld to save Cole. When she arrives, Cole tells her that she should not have come and puts his hands around her neck.\n\nAt the news station, Elana (Mercedes Colón) shows her crew what she caught on tape, of Prue and Piper vanquishing Shax, and some of her co-workers shoot down her idea that it was not real, though she convinces them to air it. Prue and Piper go back to the street where they vanquished Shax, and Prue tells her that she has a bad feeling about how they vanquished him. When Darryl (Dorian Gregory) brings a suspect into the station, his Captain (Redmond Hicks) shows him the news feed, and he calls Piper and Prue to tell them that they have been exposed. Darryl arrives at the manor, and tells them that they could be arrested because they killed someone on live television. Piper admits that she knew they should not have followed Shax into the street, and Darryl tells Prue and Piper that his Captain wants them down at the station. Leo then orbs in telling them The Elders do not know how to fix magic being exposed. When Prue asks Leo to take them to the hospital, he tells her that The Elders are not allowing Whitelighters to orb because they could be exposed too. Down in The Underworld, Cole confesses to Phoebe that he is now evil, and that she needs to go, but Phoebe tells him that she can save him and their love can conquer anything. When Phoebe smashes a potion on Cole's back, he kisses her, showing that the spell he was put under has broken. Phoebe then asks Cole to come back to the manor, but he says that if he were to go back there, demons would always go after him. Back at the hospital, Prue and Piper arrive to take Dr. Griffiths back to the manor for his safety. Shax then appears in a tornado, knocking Dr. Griffiths out of the car, and Prue and Piper say the vanquishing spell which wounds Shax. However, they did not know that the news crew followed them to the hospital and taped them vanquishing Shax again.\n\nThe manor is then swarmed by helicopters, police officers, protesters, and news reporters. When Prue turns on the television, she finds Dr. Griffiths on the news telling reporters everything that happened when they first saved him. Prue and Piper then call Leo for help, and Leo tells them that they need to contact the demon Tempus to reverse time. Piper says that they vanquished Tempus, but Leo tells her that he was never vanquished and was just defeated. In the middle of their conversation, a crazed Wiccan fanatic named Alice (Marianna Elliott) breaks into the manor, telling Prue and Piper that she wants to join their coven; however, Prue throws her out of the manor. Leo then goes to The Underworld to tell Cole and Phoebe what has happened above ground and asks Cole if he can get Tempus to reverse time. When Cole tells Leo that he cannot summon Tempus, Phoebe says that he should ask The Source (Michael Bailey Smith), since the demonic side of magic has been exposed too. The Source then tells Cole that if Tempus was to reverse time, it would destroy him, but The Source says that he will do it if Phoebe agrees to join the dark side because it is the only way to save one of her sisters from dying.\n\nBack at the manor, Prue and Piper barricade the doors, and Prue confesses to Piper that she is scared. When Prue tells Piper about what could happen, she hears a gunshot. When she looks down at Piper, she sees that Piper has been shot from a rifle used by the crazed Wiccan fanatic Alice. Prue then rushes to her car with Piper in her arms and cries out for Leo. She realizes that she has to drive to the hospital because Leo is in The Underworld and he cannot hear her calling. When several people block the driveway, Prue telekinetically sends them flying through the air. When she arrives at the hospital, Dr. Griffiths and his team race to save Piper's life. Despite all their efforts, Piper dies and a grief-stricken Prue orders all of the doctors to get out of the room. In The Underworld, Cole comes back from seeing The Source and tells Leo and Phoebe about the proposal because it is the only way to save one of her sisters. Back at the hospital, the SWAT team arrive, and Prue still furious about losing Piper, uses her powers and fighting skills against them, and locks herself in the room, just as Leo orbs in to see his wife has died. He then orbs back to The Underworld to confirm that Piper was the sister that died, and Phoebe agrees to stay in The Underworld to save Piper's life. Cole then tells The Source, but when he leaves, The Source tells his hit-man to kill Phoebe and detain Cole. Just as the SWAT team are about to shoot Prue, time is reversed to the sisters' first encounter with Shax at the manor.

He was president of many scientific and professional organizations during his lifetime including president of the American Public Health Association in 1915. He was one of three founders of the joint MIT-Harvard School of Public Health in 1913.\n\nWilliam T. Sedgwick was born on December 29, 1855 in West Hartford, CT. He was the son of William Sedgwick and Anne Thompson Sedgwick. In 1877, he received his undergraduate degree from the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University. He studied for two years at the Yale School of Medicine where he was also an instructor in physiological chemistry (1878–9). He left Yale to take up studies at Johns Hopkins University in physiology. He became interested in biology and changed his course of study graduating with a PhD in biology in 1881. He remained at Hopkins for two years as an associate in biology.\n\nIn 1883, Sedgwick was appointed to the faculty at MIT. He was promoted to associate professor in 1884 and to full professor in 1891. He became head of what ultimately became known as the Department of Biology at MIT.\n\nIn 1888, Sedgwick began giving lectures in bacteriology to students in the civil engineering curriculum. His students became the spokesmen and practitioners who brought the principles of public health into the practice of engineering beginning in the 1890s and lasting well into the 20th century.\n\nWhile he has been hailed as the first scientific American epidemiologist, Sedgwick was also described as not having a mathematical mind. He taught ideas and principles to his students. He instilled in his students the need to develop three basic behaviors: a vision of the subject in relation to the broader world, an honest method of working to seek the truth and an enthusiasm for service to the profession the public.\n\nIn 1902, he published the groundbreaking book, Principles of Sanitary Science and the Public Health, which was a compilation of his lectures from the courses he taught at MIT and a distillation of his experience working in the field.\n\nSedgwick influenced many practitioners in the field of public health. He played a key role in Samuel Cate Prescott's choice to go into bacteriology as a career, and was instrumental in Prescott's selection in the canning research with William Lyman Underwood in 1895–6 that would lead to the growth of food technology.\n\nSedgwick’s courses at MIT and his influence on civil engineering students there can be considered the first instructions in the field of public health. However, he and two colleagues felt that a more formal academic structure was needed. In 1913, he joined with George C. Whipple and Milton J. Rosenau to establish the Harvard-MIT School for Public Health Officers. This was the first formal academic program designed to train public health professionals. The joint program lasted until 1922 when Harvard University decided to launch the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nBeginning in 1888, Sedgwick was appointed as consulting biologist to the Massachusetts State Board of Health. He directed bacteriological research at the Lawrence Experiment Station and sent his brightest engineering students to work there—including George W. Fuller and Allen Hazen. Even though he was not known for his laboratory research studies, he was responsible, along with George W. Rafter in 1889, for developing the enumeration procedure and apparatus for examining microscopic organisms in surface water bodies. \nThe Sedgwick-Rafter counting cell is still in use today.\n\nThe Lawrence Experiment Station annual reports highlighted Sedgwick’s role as an epidemiologist. “In epidemiology, Sedgwick played a more direct and personal role and he was, indeed, the first scientific American epidemiologist.” Sedgwick used the annual report covering the work done in 1891 as a vehicle to publish his epidemiological studies of typhoid fever. “In the Annual Report of the State Board of Health of Massachusetts for 1892, Sedgwick presented studies on typhoid fever epidemics at Lowell and Lawrence, at Springfield and at Bondsville, which were classics in the field and which make this one of the most outstanding volumes in the history of epidemiology.”\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the water supply for Jersey City, New Jersey was contaminated with sewage and the death toll from typhoid fever was high. In 1899, the city contracted with a private company for the construction of a new water supply on the Rockaway River, which included a dam, reservoir and 23-mile pipeline. The project was completed on May 23, 1904; however, no treatment was provided to the water supply, because the contract did not require it. The city, claiming that the contract provisions were not fulfilled, filed a lawsuit in the Chancery Court of New Jersey. Jersey City officials complained that the water served to the city was not \"pure and wholesome.\" Sedgwick testified as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in both trials. In the first trial, he testified that the water that was supplied to the city was contaminated with bacteria from sewage discharges in the watershed above the reservoir.\n\nIn the second trial, Sedgwick disagreed strongly with the proposal by John L. Leal to treat the water from the reservoir with calcium hypochlorite, which was called chloride of lime at that time. Instead, he believed that the construction of sewers in the watershed and a sewage disposal plant would be the preferable course of action. He also testified that chlorination did not remove organic matter, particulates and other filth, which could weaken the vital resistance of water consumers. However, the chlorination system was found to be safe, effective and reliable by the Special Master, William J. Magie, and was judged capable of supplying Jersey City with water that was \"pure and wholesome.\"\n\nSedgwick lived his entire life in New England. He married Mary Katrine Rice of New Haven, CT on December 29, 1881. They had no children.\n\nSedgwick was a supporter of many causes that furthered the betterment of the public and he volunteered his time for numerous charitable institutions including his position of curator of the Lowell Institute beginning in 1897. However, he opposed women’s suffrage and anything that smacked of equality of the sexes. In a long article in the New York Times, Sedgwick stated his views plainly. He believed that women’s suffrage and feminism “…would mean a degeneration and degradation of human fibre which would turn back the hands of time a thousand years.” \n\nSedgwick was a prolific writer who published several hundred papers and other writings. His two most influential books were Principles of Sanitary Science and the Public Health and A Short History of Science. In the book, A Pioneer of Public Health, the authors include a complete list of Sedgwick’s publications.\n\nHe joined the New England Water Works Association in 1890 and was elected president of that organization in 1905. In 1902, he joined the American Public Health Association and became its president in 1915. He helped found the Society of American Bacteriologists (now American Society for Microbiology) and was chosen as president in 1900. He was also president of the American Society of Naturalists in 1900.\n\nSedgwick became a member of the Advisory Committee of the U.S. Public Health Service in 1902 and was involved in the adoption of the first national standards on drinking water quality—elimination of the common cup in 1912 and bacteriological standards for interstate carriers in 1914. After World War I, he was commissioned as Assistant Surgeon General in the reserves of the U.S. Public Health Service. Also, in 1914, Sedgwick was appointed a member of the Massachusetts Public Health Council, which was a component of the State Department of Public Health. He served on the Committee on Sanitary Engineering and he was Chairman of the Committee on Food and Drugs.\n\nIn 1904, he was made an honorary member of the New England Water Works Association. He was elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1901 and became vice president of that organization in 1905. In 1906, sixty of his former students gathered to honor Sedgwick at a dinner and symposium in Boston, MA. A middle school has been named in his honor in West Hartford, CT.\n\nIn 1909, Yale University conferred upon him the honorary degree of Sc.D. and the University of Cincinnati gave him an honorary LL.D. in 1920.\n\nThe American Public Health Association established the Sedgwick Memorial Medal in 1929 in his honor, for distinguished service and advancement of public health knowledge and practice. It is considered the APHA's highest honor.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2116663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116663", "title": "Thomas Griffiths Wainewright", "text": "Thomas Griffiths Wainewright\n\nThomas Griffiths Wainewright (October 179417 August 1847) was an English artist, author and suspected serial killer. He gained a reputation as profligate and a dandy, and in 1837, was transported to the penal colony of Van Diemen's Land (now the Australian state of Tasmania) for frauds on the Bank of England. As a convict he became a portraitist for Hobart's elite.\n\nWainewright's life captured the imagination of renowned 19th-century literary figures such as Charles Dickens, Oscar Wilde and Edward Bulwer-Lytton, some of whom wildly exaggerated his supposed crimes, claiming among other things that he carried strychnine in a special compartment in a ring on his finger.\n\nThomas Griffiths Wainewright was born into affluence in Richmond, London, England. He was orphaned when he was very young, his mother dying in childbirth and his father soon afterwards. Wainewright's mother Ann was the daughter of Ralph Griffiths (1720–1803), for many years the editor of the literary magazine \"Monthly Review\". The young Wainewright was brought up in style by his elderly maternal grandparents in Chiswick, then on London's rural periphery. When Griffiths died, Wainewright came under the care of his maternal uncle, George Griffiths. He was probably educated by the scholar Charles Burney, the headmaster of the Greenwich Academy.\n\nWainewright subsequently served briefly as an officer in a yeomanry regiment, having bought his commission in 1814, but lasted just over a year, probably because of a severe mental illness. It was suggested by the writer Havelock Ellis that Wainewright was never normal after this period of his life, when he was on the verge of or already succumbed to insanity, and this contributed to his later crimes.\n\nIn 1819, Wainewright embarked on a literary career, and began to write for \"The Literary Pocket-Book\", \"Blackwood's Magazine\" and \"The Foreign Quarterly Review\". He was, however, most closely linked with \"The London Magazine\", to which he contributed articles and art criticism from 1820 to 1823, under the \"noms-de-plume\" of Janus Weathercock, Egomet Bonmot and Cornelius van Vinkbooms. Wainewright's success in publication would have been assisted by his famous grandfather. He was a friend of Charles Lamb, who thought well of his writing and, in a letter to Bernard Barton, styles him \"the kind, light-hearted Wainewright.\" Wainewright also practised as an artist and was trained by John Linnell and Thomas Phillips. He produced a portrait of Lord Byron and made illustrations for the poems of William Chamberlayne, and from 1821 to 1825 exhibited narratives based on literature and music at the Royal Academy, including \"Romance from Undine\", \"Paris in the Chamber of Helen\" and \"the Milkmaid's Song\". None of these works have survived.\n\nIn the 1960s, the controversial author Donald McCormick claimed that Wainewright was a friend of William Corder, the murderer of Maria Marten in the Red Barn Murder in Polstead, Suffolk in 1827. It was claimed that the two met when Corder visited London and joined some intellectual circles. McCormick was unable to produce any evidence for his claims when asked by the author of a 2018 biography of Wainewright.\n\nOn 13 November 1817, Wainewright married Eliza Frances Ward. He had inherited £5,250 from his grandfather, invested at the Bank of England, but was unable to touch the capital, receiving only the dividends of £200 a year; the capital was in trust for his family, Eliza and their son Griffiths. However, his extravagant lifestyle landed him in colossal debt. On two separate occasions, Wainewright forged signatures of power of attorney and withdrew large sums from the Bank of England, first in 1822 and then in 1823. The second time left the account empty.\n\nBy 1828, the Wainewrights were in severe financial trouble again and forced to move in with the elderly George Griffiths, still living at the Wainewright estate in Chiswick. He died in agony shortly afterwards. Eliza's mother married again, becoming a Mrs Abercromby, and had two further daughters, Helen and Madalina, before being widowed again. They too moved into the estate, and Mrs Abercromby settled her will in favour of Eliza. She died shortly afterwards.\n\nOwing to his extravagant habits, Wainewright remained mired in debt. In 1830, he and Eliza insured the life of his sister-in-law Helen with various companies for a sum of £16,000 (some £1,650,000 in 2016). She died in December of the same year after showing signs of strychnine poisoning, though at that time there was no forensic test to prove it. When the insurance companies sued, Wainewright fled to Calais to avoid investigation of his uncovered bank frauds. Unproven tales by Victorian authors claimed that he was seized by the authorities as a suspected person and imprisoned for six months. He had in his possession a quantity of strychnine, and was widely suspected to have poisoned not only his sister-in-law and his uncle, but also his mother-in-law and a Norfolk friend, although this was never proven. He returned to London in 1837, but was soon arrested on a charge of the bank forgery. Wainewright was sent to Hobart, Van Dieman's Land (now Tasmania) on the convict ship \"Susan\", arriving 21 November 1837. While in prison he was asked if he poisoned Helen, to which he allegedly replied: \"Yes; it was a dreadful thing to do, but she had very thick ankles.\". The quotation is now thought to have been made up by Oscar Wilde's publisher.\n\nDuring his ten years in the penal colony, Wainewright did eventually enjoy a certain amount of freedom. After initially working on a road gang, he became a hospital orderly and was able to work as an artist, painting portraits in the homes of his subjects. He completed more than 100 portraits on paper using coloured wash, pencil and ink during his years in Hobart. They survive in public museums and private collections throughout Australia, some having remained in the families of his sitters. They depict the officialdom, professionals and members of the elite in early Hobart. A self-portrait was completed in this period. Wainewright had a conditional pardon granted on 14 November 1846; he died of apoplexy in the Hobart Town hospital on 17 August the following year. He is buried in an unknown grave.\n\nThe \"Essays and Criticisms\" of Wainewright were published in 1880, with an account of his life, by W. Carew Hazlitt; and the history of his crimes suggested to Charles Dickens his story \"Hunted Down\" and to Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton his novel \"Lucretia\". Wainewright's personality, as artist and poisoner, also interested Oscar Wilde in \"Pen, Pencil and Poison\" (Fortnightly Review, Jan. 1889), and A. G. Allen, in T. Seccombe's \"Twelve Bad Men\" (1894).\n\nWainewright has been the subject of four biographical studies: \"The Fatal Cup: Thomas Griffiths Wainewright and the strange deaths of his relations\" by John Price Williams (Markosia, London 2018) which re-examines the poisonings and reaches a different conclusion as to Wainewright's guilt. Other studies include \"Janus Weathercock\" by Jonathan Curling (Thomas Nelson and Sons, London, 1938), Robert Crossland's \"Wainewright in Tasmania\" (OUP, Melbourne, 1954), and the poet Andrew Motion's creative biography, \"Wainewright the Poisoner\" (2000). Arthur Conan Doyle also mentions Wainewright in the Sherlock Holmes story \"The Adventure of the Illustrious Client\" as \"no mean artist\", but spells his name without the middle \"e\".\n\nWainewright was the subject of the seventeenth episode of the television show \"Thriller\", \"The Poisoner\" (aired 10 January 1961), with Murray Matheson playing the role of the killer (given the fictional name Thomas Edward Griffith) and featuring Sarah Marshall as his wife.\n\n\n"}

About half of the route was abandoned in 1859; the rest became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) route into the Delmarva Peninsula and is still used by Norfolk Southern Railway. The abandoned segment from Porter, Delaware, to Frenchtown, Maryland, the New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad Right-of-Way, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.\n\nWhen construction began in 1804 on the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal, which would connect the Delaware River to the Chesapeake Bay, merchants and other businessmen of New Castle, Delaware, perceived a threat to their interests and proposed a railroad to connect their own city to the bay. The New-Castle and Frenchtown Turnpike Company was chartered in Delaware on January 24, 1809, and in Maryland on January 6, 1810. It opened in 1815 and 1816, providing a turnpike from New Castle in a west-southwest direction to Old Frenchtown Wharf, Maryland, on Chesapeake Bay. The easternmost section of the road, east of Clark's Corner (under 3 miles), had been built in 1812 by the New Castle Turnpike Company, chartered January 30, 1811.\n\nIn 1828, the Maryland General Assembly authorized the company to replace the turnpike with a railroad and change its name to the New-Castle and French Town Turnpike and Rail Road Company. Similar laws did the same for the two companies in Delaware, renaming the New Castle Turnpike Company to the New Castle Turnpike and Railroad Company. The companies merged on March 31, 1830, to form the New Castle and Frenchtown Turnpike and Rail Road Company – with no dash in New Castle – and the new railroad opened in 1831, using horses for about a year before switching to steam locomotives. The chief engineer for the construction of the railroad was John Randel Jr..\n\nThe Chesapeake & Delaware Canal finally opened in 1829, becoming a major competitor to the railroad. Another railroad company, later called the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (PW&B), began construction along a nearby route in the mid-1830s. In 1838, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad began operating trains along this route between Baltimore and Philadelphia, bypassing the much smaller and less significant New Castle. On March 15, 1839, the PW&B bought the NC&F, using it as an alternate route.\n\nThe New Castle and Wilmington Rail Road was connected to the New Castle end of the system in 1852, and by 1856 the Delaware Railroad had opened, splitting from the New Castle and Frenchtown at Porter, about halfway between the two ends. \n\nThe Cecil County portion of the track bed had been abandoned by 1848, and the County Commissioners turned it into \"a common neighborhood road,\" the Cecil Whig reported. In 1859, the railroad was abandoned west of Porter; most of the right-of-way is still cleared.\n\nOn March 28, 1877, the New Castle and Frenchtown was merged into the PW&B, which was part of the PRR system. In 1891, the PW&B sold the old New Castle and Frenchtown line, as well as the New Castle and Wilmington, to the Delaware Railroad, which was leased to the PW&B.\n\nThe east half of the old alignment was acquired by Penn Central in 1968, then Conrail in 1976, and most recently Norfolk Southern (1999), which uses it to reach the Delmarva Peninsula.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

The song contains some lyrics from the first verse of \"Sober\", with the same basic melody, although the melody is considerably faster and has an instrumental chorus.\n\nThe song was recorded by Keenan with Tool for the first time in mid-1991 on a demo tape titled \"72826\".\n\nA video for \"Sober\" was made in 1993. It debuted in May of that same year and was directed by Fred Stuhr. It was filmed using stop-motion animation, with the characters' models designed by Adam Jones. It was the first of Tool's videos to be made in stop motion, the earlier promo video for \"Hush\" being live action. Whereas all four band members could be seen at all times during the previous clip, \"Sober\" shows only brief flashes of them. A live-action clay figure is shown twitching and vibrating violently.\n\nThe video's protagonist is a small, humanoid being, who lives and sleeps in an abandoned mansion, in a rusty room sparsely decorated with a table, a chair, and a bed with no mattress and a curtain as a blanket. He happens to stumble upon a wooden box, which he opens near the beginning. Its contents are kept hidden for the majority of the video's duration, but it seems whatever it is has had adverse mind altering effects – there are repeated shots of the humanoid levitating in his chair, and his head and arm vibrating wildly. While experiencing these effects, the figure ventures through his living quarters and its many corridors.\n\nThe climax provides a barrage of imagery and revelations: a figure attached to a wall behind a translucent screen, a sentry of sorts wielding a mobile, robotic cannon and an organic substance flowing through a pipe found in the house. At the end, the box is empty, leaving the viewer to determine its meaning.\n\nTool\n\n\n"}

It began on March 11, 1982, and ended with the championship game on March 29 in the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. A total of 47 games were played.\n\nNorth Carolina, coached by Dean Smith, won the national title with a 63–62 victory in the final game over Georgetown, coached by John Thompson. James Worthy of North Carolina was named the Tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\n\nThis Tournament was the first to eliminate the national third place game, which had been held every year since the 1946 tournament. It was also the first tournament to be televised by CBS after it acquired the broadcasting rights from NBC. Gary Bender and Billy Packer (also from NBC Sports) called the Final Four and National Championship games. In addition, it was the first tournament to include the word \"Men's\" in its official title, as the NCAA began sponsoring national championships in women's sports (including basketball) in the 1981–82 school year.\n\nThis was the last NCAA Tournament to grant automatic bids to the winners of ECAC regional tournaments for Northeastern Division I independents organized by the Eastern College Athletic Conference, a loose sports federation of Northeastern colleges and universities. The practice had begun with the 1975 Tournament to ensure that Northeastern independents would not be excluded, but was discontinued when all remaining Northeastern independents formed new conferences or joined existing ones after this season.\n\nThe 1982 NCAA Division I Men's Championship Game was between the Georgetown Hoyas and the North Carolina Tar Heels. Both teams had Hall of Fame coaches, Dean Smith for the Tar Heels and John Thompson for the Hoyas. As for players, five future NBA All-Stars were included between the two sides—the Hoyas featured center Patrick Ewing and Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd, while the Tar Heels answered with forward James Worthy, forward and center Sam Perkins, and young guard Michael Jordan. This also marked the only NCAA championship game to feature three of the NBA 50 Greatest Players (Jordan, Ewing and Worthy) chosen in 1996 on the occasion of the NBA's 50th anniversary.\nThe championship matchup was tightly contested throughout, with no team ever leading by more than a few points, and 15 lead changes in the game overall. With slightly over a minute to go, Floyd scored to put Georgetown on top, 62–61. During the ensuing timeout, Smith predicted that Georgetown would heavily guard Worthy and Perkins and drew up a play that would work the ball around to Jordan and then met Jordan's eyes and told him to not be afraid to shoot if he was open. When the ball was worked around, Jimmy Black found Jordan on the left wing, and he rose and hit a jumper with 17 seconds to go to put Carolina back on top, 63–62. Georgetown did not call timeout but immediately pushed the ball up the court. However, guard Fred Brown mistook Carolina's James Worthy for a teammate and passed the ball right to his opponent. Worthy was fouled by Eric Smith with two seconds to go. He missed both free throws, but with no timeouts left (Georgetown coach John Thompson, in a questionable move, used his last one before Worthy's free throws rather than save it to set up a final play) the Hoyas' last desperation shot fell short. On the other hand, Dean Smith's decision to draw up a play for Jordan, rather than Worthy or Perkins, is often regarded as a brilliant coaching move.\nAside from the dramatic finish in the final minute, the 1982 NCAA championship game is today primarily remembered as being the stage on which several eventual basketball legends were introduced to a national audience, particularly North Carolina's Jordan and Georgetown's Ewing, both 19-year-old freshmen at the time of this game. Both had outstanding games - Jordan with 16 points including the game-winner, and Ewing with 23 points and 10 rebounds (but also a few goaltends on blocks that John Thompson supported for intimidation purposes). Jordan and Ewing would go on to have more memorable clashes in the National Basketball Association with the Chicago Bulls and New York Knicks respectively, and both would be inducted into the Hall of Fame. For Jordan's part, his game-winner is often seen as the launching point of his career - the moment that gave him the confidence to become what many believe to be the greatest basketball player of all time, in no small part due to his clutch performance. Jordan has said multiple times that before he would take game-winning shots with the Bulls, he would sometimes think back to his shot in the 1982 game that propelled North Carolina past Georgetown.\n\nThe real star of the 1982 title game, and a third player in this game who would eventually be inducted to the pro basketball Hall of Fame, was Carolina's James Worthy. Worthy scored a game-high 28 points, showing the blazing speed and some of the same authoritative drives to the basket that later became familiar sights during his career with the powerful Los Angeles Lakers of the 1980s. Beyond these three legendary players, two other outstanding pro players of the 1980s and early 90s appeared in this 1982 game: Georgetown's Sleepy Floyd, who went on to an All-Star career in the NBA (including a still-standing record for most points in a quarter and in a half for a playoff game) and Carolina's Sam Perkins, who distinguished himself over a durable NBA career lasting 17 seasons.\n\nThe 1982 Tournament marked the first of five to end at the Superdome, the second domed stadium after the Astrodome and twentieth venue overall to host a Final Four. The tournament was the first to feature Birmingham and Uniondale, as well as the first for Reunion Arena after four previous appearances for SMU's Moody Coliseum in Dallas. The games played at Uniondale were the first in the New York Metropolitan Area since 1974.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> – Denotes overtime period\n\n"}

It derived its name from the command commonly used to execute commercial software from a Commodore 1541 disk: codice_1, with inspiration from the word \"lodestar\".\n\n\"Loadstar\" was launched as a sister publication of \"Softdisk\", based in Shreveport, Louisiana. It was the second platform for which Softdisk produced a disk magazine, after the Apple II. At the time, the Commodore 64 was a very popular home computer due to its inexpensive price and advanced graphics and sound capabilities.\n\nEarly issues of \"Loadstar\" were produced by the Softdisk staff, most of whom had more experience with Apple than Commodore computers at the time, and much of the content was ported over from the Apple. However, over time, Commodore-specific staff and freelance contributors came aboard.\n\nIn addition, \"Loadstar\" was the official disk magazine for magazines published by Commodore, including \"Power/Play\" and \"Commodore Magazine\". Users could find type-in programs from these publications featured on \"Loadstar\".\n\nIn 1987, Fender Tucker was hired as its editor, and he gave \"Loadstar\" a distinctive style and atmosphere, including references to a fictional \"Loadstar Tower\" where it was supposedly published (the offices at the time were in fact in a basement). \"Loadstar\"'s staff soon expanded to include Jeffrey L. Jones and Scott E. Resh, and the magazine's regular \"Puzzle Page\" feature - with interactive crosswords, card games, and logic puzzles - was edited by Barbara Schulak.\n\nUnder Tucker, a sister publication \"Loadstar 128\" was launched for the Commodore 128 personal computer. This magazine was quarterly. Jones contributed to the \"Loadstar Letter\", a printed publication which accompanied issues of \"Loadstar\".\n\nIn 1989, Loadstar published \"DigitHunt\", a number-puzzle game which was apparently the first home computer implementation of Sudoku.\n\nA notable feature in some early issues is the inclusion of a disk with software to access the then-new online service Quantum Link, which had been fervently pitched to \"Loadstar\" by head of marketing Steve Case. The company that ran this service eventually turned into America Online.\n\nAs the years went by and the Commodore 64 was increasingly regarded as an obsolete computer, the resources of the company were shifted to software for more current systems such as Windows and the Macintosh, and later to the Internet. However, \"Loadstar\" held on, and ultimately outlasted the disk magazines for newer platforms. When Softdisk no longer wished to support it, it was spun off as an independent company, J&F Publishing, co-owned by Tucker and his wife, Judi Mangham, who was a co-founder of Softdisk. It has continued to be published, well into the 2000s, for a cult-following audience of old-time Commodore buffs and for people who run it using Commodore 64 emulators on other platforms.\n\nIn January, 2001, Dave and Sheri Moorman of Holly, Colorado took over as editors. It remained in publication until 2008, in several formats including \"classic\" Commodore 1541 floppy disks and e-mailed files in C-64 emulator format. An official Web site exists, but not at the earlier loadstar.com address, which now belongs to somebody in Russia according to its WHOIS record.\n\nJ&F Publishing still officially owns it, but the editing and distribution had been franchised to the Moormans' company, eTower Marketing, with Dave Moorman editing the monthly magazines and Sheri Moorman handling business matters. Tucker is now concentrating on other ventures such as republishing the books of Harry Stephen Keeler under his Ramble House imprint.\n\n249 issues of \"Loadstar\" were published. It was scheduled to cease publication with issue 256 with Dave Moorman kindly making issue 248 a free pass-around issue in November 2007. However, Dave Moorman moved on in 2008, leaving his last issue 250 unpublished. After another Loadstar assistant finished editing it, issue 250 was unofficially released in June 2010.\n\n"}

John was educated at All Souls College, Oxford (1570, awarded BA 1578) and studied law at Furnival's Inn (1572) and the Inner Temple (1576). He claimed to be directly descended from the princes of Gwynedd through Rhodri ab Owain son of Owain Gwynedd. The male line from his family died out in 1779 (see 'Legacy' section below) and the senior male line passed to the Anwyl of Tywyn family. His mother was Jane (Siân) Bulkeley, daughter of Sir Richard Bulkeley and his wife Catherine Griffith, and sister of Sir Richard Bulkeley, head of the Anglesey branch of a powerful landowning family, who originally came from Cheshire.\n\nHe was Member of Parliament for this county in 1586 and served as Sheriff of Caernarvonshire for 1587–88 and 1602–03 and Sheriff of Merionethshire for 1588–89 and 1600–01. He was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of Caernarvonshire in 1587, a member of the Council of the Marches of Wales c.1603 and Custos Rotulorum of Caernarvonshire in 1618 (to 1627).\n\nWynn was regarded as quarrelsome and a bad neighbour and landlord. His lawsuits often went on for many years; some were against his own relatives like Sir Richard Bulkeley and the Griffiths of Penrhyn Castle. He became regarded as such a public nuisance that in 1615 the Council of the Marches of Wales, of which he was a former member, reprimanded him, fined him and briefly imprisoned him.\n\nIn 1606, he was made a knight and in 1611 became the first of the Wynn baronets. He was interested in several mining ventures and also found time for antiquarian studies.\n\nHe married Sidney, daughter of Sir William Gerard, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and his wife Dorothy Barton, by whom he had 10 sons and 2 daughters. His eldest son, John, was unhappily married to Eleanor Cave in 1606 and died in Italy in 1614.\n\nSir John's successor was his second and eldest surviving son Richard. His daughter Elizabeth married Sir John Bodvel of Caerfryn, and was the mother of John Bodvel. Another daughter, Mary, married Sir Roger Mostyn.\n\nWynn's work \"The History of the Gwydir Family\", which had a great reputation in North Wales, was intended to assert his claim to royal ancestry. In a legal challenge to these claim Thomas Prys of Plas Iolyn brought a case against him and Sir John was forced to defend himself in court. He won the case and afterwards was recognised as the most prominent male heir of the House of Gwynedd. Under Welsh succession law the head of the Price of Esgairweddan family at the time, descended through Iorwerth ab Owain Gwynedd and Dafydd II, would lead the senior line and be \"de jure\" Princes of Gwynedd, however they died out in the male line in 1702 and the royal title would have passed there from to the Wynn Family of Gwydir at that time. John Wynn's book was first published by Daines Barrington in 1770, and in 1878 an edition was published at Oswestry. It is valuable as the only work which describes the state of society in North Wales in the 15th and the earlier part of the 16th century.\n\n\nAt Llanrwst Wynn founded a hospital and endowed a school, now Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy. His estate of Gwydir came to Robert Bertie, first Duke of Ancaster, in the 17th century, by his marriage with the heiress of the Wynns. On the death of the penultimate duke in 1779, Gwydir was inherited by his sister Priscilla, Baronness Willoughby de Eresby in her own right, whose husband was created Baron Gwydyr.\nOn the death of Alberic, Baron Willoughby de Eresby in 1870, this title (now merged in that of earl of Ancaster) fell into abeyance between his two daughters, while that of Baron Gwydir passed to his cousin and male heir. Gwydir itself was sold by the earl of Ancaster in 1895, the house and part of the estate being bought by Lord Carrington, who also claimed descent from Sir John Wynn.\n\nOn 28 May 2010, Llanrwst celebrated the 400th anniversary of the almshouses there, which were built by Sir John Wynn to provide shelter for twelve poor older men of the parish. Today, those twelve rooms are used to show different periods of history.\n\nIn this festival, Sir John Wynn was played by actor Sion Rickard, a student studying Performing Arts at Coleg Llandrillo, who arrived with his \"wife\" in the main square of Llanrwst by horse and carriage from Gwydir Castle, then answered questions from the local town crier, went inside the almshouse to check the standard of what he had built and delivered a speech to the people of Llanrwst.\n\n\nAttribution\n\n"}
{"id": "2116722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116722", "title": "Multi-site church", "text": "Multi-site church\n\nA multi-site church is a specific church congregation which holds services at multiple geographical locations, either within a specific metropolitan area or, increasingly, several such areas.\n\nWithin the multi-site approach, both the primary location (usually the one with the largest physical attendance) and the offsite locations will commonly have their own music worship and announcements pertaining to that congregation. Commonly, though, the sermon will be broadcast via satellite from the primary location, though some churches use on-site ministers to deliver the sermon, but generally it is the same sermon presented to all congregants at all locations.\n\nAccording to Todd Rhoades of Monday Morning Insight, an October 2005 US multisite church conference released statistics regarding growth in the number of churches in the United States operating as multisite:\n\nThrough trial and error, churches have found that attempting to broadcast video to campuses during the other portions of the church service, like worship and times of prayer, is largely unsuccessful. Instead, most multisite churches produce music, worship, and prayer at each satellite campus to help solidify the sense of community and connection during those times as well as create an environment unique to that of the main campus, while remaining true to the brand and identity of the church.\n\nIn 1998, the \"video venue\" was born. It is widely accepted that North Coast Church of Vista, California was the first church to hold an additional service using video technology to reproduce the experience of the pastor's message in different areas of their campus. Within twenty-four months over 1,300 attendees were choosing one of the Video Venues instead of the original live service. One year later it was 2,300. By 2005 North Coast was offering 21 worship services in five locations and now hosts a multisite conference to assist other churches. Other churches, including Community Christian Church of Naperville, Illinois, have also been cited as launching a video venue the same year.\n\nOne of the most prominent examples of a church embracing the multisite approach is Seacoast Church. In 2002, after several years of growth, the church hit a physical growth barrier with 3,000 attending Sunday services. The church submitted a number of requests to the local authorities requesting permission to expand their campus. The city rejected all requests, frustrating the leadership of the church. Under the careful guidance of Pastor Greg Surratt, Seacoast began experimenting with a satellite campus that produced a unique service at an alternate location, reducing the strain of traffic and staff on the main campus. The new campus was overwhelmingly successful, leading to the launch of other strategically placed campuses throughout the city.\n\nToday, Seacoast operates thirteen campuses throughout South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia and has over 10,000 people attending Sunday services. Seacoast was featured in the Summer 2004 issue of Vision magazine, the first multisite church to appear in Vision. (Fellowship Church became a multisite church after their feature in Vision). Mars Hill Church, developed a multisite approach due to similar challenges with Seattle, Washington's planning and zoning regulations. Living Hope Church in Vancouver, Washington became the first Church to launch five campuses at once on Easter Sunday in 2006, after studying some of their predecessors.\n\nThe modern church has slowly begun to embrace the idea behind multisite churches. However, not all church leaders agree with what is happening in the multi-site movement. Eddie Gibbs, professor of church growth at Fuller Theological Seminary, stressed some concern over multisite churches, arguing that the multisite church movement \"perpetuates the chronic problem that (the Church) have of undiscipled church members\" through a lack of relationship between congregants and the teaching pastor.\n\nStill, churches throughout the world are transferring their churches from single campuses with a ceiling of impact to multiple campuses with seemingly unlimited capabilities. This has created a brand for many churches, some overnight. Churches like Church of the Highlands, Shirelive Church, Celebration Church, Life.Church, Fellowship Church, Second Baptist Church Houston, National Community Church, North Point Community Church, Calvary Chapel of Ft Lauderdale, The Bible Chapel, Triumph Church, Hillsong Church, Substance Church, Bon Air Baptist Church, Southeast Christian Church (Louisville), Gateway Church (Texas), Prestonwood Baptist Church, Saddleback Church, LifePoint Church (Clarksville, TN) and Willow Creek Community Church are continuing to expand their ministry base through the use of multiple campuses.\n\nA new frontier for multisite churches is to go into cyberspace with an Internet Campus. An Internet Campus typically enhances a live streaming video of a worship service with interactive elements for viewers to chat with each other, respond to polls, and/or submit prayer requests.\n\nAnother model of the multisite church which excludes video is built around a common vision and leadership. Doxa Deo and Hillsong Church are both multisite churches with more than 20 sites who function on this basis. This campus model includes a common vision and leadership but each campus is led by a campus pastor.\n\n\n\n"}

At the time, this noble family had many conflicts with the Vetkopers. Nothing remains of the \"stins\" today. Sloten is first mentioned having city rights in a charter dated to 30 August 1426. In 1523, the city was the last Frisian fortress to fall into the hands of the heirs of the counts of Holland. During the siege of Sloten in 1523, where Frisian and Gelderland troops were stationed, the Hollandic nobleman Jan II van Wassenaer was fatally wounded. This nobleman was the last Dutchman to die in the struggle for control of Friesland.\n\nSloten is located on the once important waterway from Sneek to the former Zuiderzee, overseeing access to the Hanseatic cities on the IJssel. In Sloten this waterway crossed with the road from Germany to Stavoren. It was therefore possible to levy tolls and exercise strategic control at this junction. The country road ran via Doniawerstal over the \"gaasts\" (sand ridges) via Sloten, where the waterway could be bridged, to Gaasterland and on to Stavoren, which in the Late Middle Ages had been a large and important trading town. Sloten also held a key position in the Eighty Years' War. A Spanish plot to conquer the city by hiding men in a beer ship failed. At the end of World War II, the Germans blew up the bridge over the Ee to slow down the progress of Canadian troops.\n\nSince then, Sloten has lost its strategic importance. The city is popular with surface water sports enthusiasts and day-trippers. In the 1970s, a marina was built on the south side of the city where a number of water sports companies are located. There is also a sizable factory in the city that is part of the Nutreco group. The company produces milk substitutes for young cattle, such as calves and piglets. There is a lot of animal husbandry in the area of Sloten, which forms an important basis for the local economy.\n\nThe city has almost completely retained its original defensive enclosure of rampart and moat, and the original structure of Sloten has been preserved almost entirely. The fortress was designed and built by the famous fortress builder Menno van Coehoorn, who is buried in nearby Wijckel. Sloten was the ideal city in fortress terms; its shape is reminiscent of an onion, earning it the moniker of \"sipelstêd\" (onion city). The \"Sipelsneon\" (onion Saturday) is a local fair held every last Saturday of June.\n\nSloten had approximately 760 inhabitants in 2012 and is therefore not the smallest city in the Netherlands, as is often presumed. Sloten is the smallest city in Friesland, however.\n\n"}

Heinz Company Brands LLC. based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nOre-Ida's primary production facility is located in Ontario, Oregon, where the company was originally founded in 1949. It once employed over 1,000 local residents, and currently has about 650 employees. It is generally considered a leading potato brand in the American market, consistently accounting for a large amount of processed potatoes sold.\n\nIn 1934, Mormon entrepreneurs F. Nephi Grigg and Golden Grigg began growing sweet corn in eastern Oregon. Their first company, Grigg Brothers, became the largest distributor of sweet corn in the United States. In 1949, with financial backing from their brother-in-law Otis Williams, the brothers rented a frozen food plant located in Ontario, at the border with Idaho, and converted it into a potato-processing facility. The three purchased the facility around 1952 after the plant went into foreclosure. The company was officially founded that year as the Oregon Frozen Foods Company.\n\nThe company initially produced and sold frozen corn and French fries. In 1953, Nephi, Golden, and Otis developed Tater Tots, bite-sized \"logs\" formed from seasoned slivers of potatoes, which were leftovers from French fry production. Tater Tots are today considered the brand's most well known product.\nIn 1960, the company built a second plant in Idaho at Burley, where some of their potato fields were located. ' The company's name is a syllabic abbreviation of the first few letters of Oregon and Idaho and the original logo consisted of the outlines of Oregon and Idaho with \"Ore-Ida\" superimposed in italicized letters.\n\nAfter going public in 1961, the Ore-Ida brand was acquired by the H. J. Heinz Company in 1965. The Heinz company coined Ore-Ida's long time advertising slogan: “When it says Ore-Ida, it’s All Righta.”\n\nMcCain Foods purchased Ore-Ida's foodservice division in 1997, acquiring five of the company's plants, including the Burley location. Ore-Ida's division headquarters were located in Boise until 1999, when a new frozen foods division was created based at Heinz's corporate headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n"}

The competition ran alongside the Copa Mercosur—based on the actual Mercosur economic pact between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. \n\nTeams did not directly qualify for this competition. Instead, the aim was to generate profits through the television contracts by inviting the most marketable clubs from each country. Therefore, participation was based on invitation of individual clubs.\n\nThe competition—along with the Copa Mercosur—was discontinued following the conclusion of 2001. A football competition to be called the Copa Pan-Americana would replace these two competitions for the 2002 season featuring clubs from both CONMEBOL and CONCACAF. The competition was postponed, with plans to be played in 2003. Instead, a CONMEBOL competition was founded dubbed as the Copa Sudamericana in 2002.

Presuming it to be a \"Pteranodon\" egg, a scientific team unearths it from Adona Island and ships it to Japan for study. The egg displays strange psychic properties, even imprinting itself upon the biologist Azusa Gojo, before finally hatching to reveal an infant \"Godzillasaurus\". When Godzilla later appears, having sought out Baby Godzilla through an unexplained psychic link, Baby Godzilla leaves with Godzilla, later settling on Birth Island.\n\nBy the time of \"Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla\", Baby Godzilla, now rechristened Little Godzilla, periodically interacts with the human characters for a portion of the film, taking a particular liking to Major Yuki of G-Force and establishing a psychic bond with Miki Saegusa. Little Godzilla is imprisoned in a cage of crystals by SpaceGodzilla upon it arrival to Earth and remains caged until SpaceGodzilla's defeat by the combined might of Godzilla and M.O.G.U.E.R.A.\n\nLittle Godzilla continues to grow and is renamed Godzilla Junior in \"Godzilla vs. Destoroyah\". Junior quickly proves itself to be quite a capable fighter, successfully defeating Destoroyah, though with difficulty. Junior is killed during its second battle against Destoroyah at Haneda Airport, where Godzilla and Destoroyah soon fight. After Godzilla melts down, Junior is revived and grows into a new adult Godzilla.\n\nDuring the production of \"Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II\", the decision to introduce a character similar to Godzilla's first adopted son, Minilla, was made in order to appeal to the largely female audience that made \"Godzilla vs. Mothra\" a financial success, despite objections by director Takao Okawara, who held a low opinion of the 1960s movies the character had previously been featured in. Okawara redesigned the new Baby Godzilla as more dinosaur-like than its predecessor, but strove to make it physically appealing in order to contrast it with the more brutish-looking Mechagodzilla. Baby Godzilla was portrayed by Hurricane Ryu, who wore a full-body suit with an animatronic mouth and eyes. The skin was also made smoother than Godzilla's in order to imply that Baby Godzilla had yet to be exposed to the mutagenic radiation that transformed its father. According to Godzilla suit actor Kenpachiro Satsuma, Godzilla Junior was not intended to be the literal son of Godzilla, but \"the baby of a cousin.\" In an early draft for the film, Godzilla would have had soldiers injected into its bloodstream, who would then trigger a nuclear meltdown which would have killed the monster, only to have the radiation absorbed by Baby Godzilla, who would have grown into a new adult Godzilla and subsequently defeated Mechagodzilla.\n\nIn \"Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla\", special effects artist Koichi Kawakita redesigned the young Godzilla as a more cartoonish character, having disliked the character's previously more dinosaurian appearance. It was rumoured that Kawakita intended to use the new design in a children's spinoff TV special entitled \"Little Godzilla's Underground Adventure\". However, this was nothing more than a myth. The Little Godzilla incarnation was portrayed by \"Little Frankie\", a professional midget wrestler.\n\nDuring the development of what would become \"Godzilla vs. Destoroyah\", it was proposed to have Godzilla face off with Ghost Godzilla, the spirit of the original 1954 Godzilla, who would possess Godzilla Junior and force it to fight Godzilla, though this idea was scrapped. Hurricane Ryu returned as Godzilla Junior and portrayed it via traditional suitmation techniques, though because the Junior suit was almost the same size as the main Godzilla one, a small animatronic prop was used in scenes where Junior interacts with its \"father\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Amid the allegations, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) suspended the HSU's membership. Thomson maintains his innocence, but in May 2012, a report by Fair Work Australia recommended that civil court action be taken against Thomson for what the report says was a \"substantial misuse of members' funds\".

Forty-nine charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception were dismissed following an earlier finding in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on 18 February 2014 against Thomson of defrauding the HSU in order to pay for personal expenses. On 25 March 2014, Thomson was convicted on 65 charges of fraud and theft for using Health Services Union funds for personal benefit and sentenced to twelve months imprisonment, with nine months suspended over two years. Thomson's legal team immediately lodged an appeal against the conviction and sentence and was granted bail.\n\n"}

Depending on the location, the name and ingredients can significantly vary. The name \"mutabbaq\" in Arabic means \"folded\". It is a popular street food in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.\n\nMurtabak is often described as spicy folded omelette pancake with bits of vegetables. It is the most common form of murtabak; which is egg-filled pancake, sometimes mixed with green onion and minced meat, made from pan fried crepes which is folded and cut to squares. In Indonesia, the murtabak is one of the most popular street foods and is known as martabak.\n\nVegetarian murtabaks and other forms of murtabaks with chicken and other stuffings exist and can be found in many Indian Muslim restaurants in Singapore, including the Little India area and Arab Street.\n\nIn Malaysia, murtabak was originally sold in Indian Muslim restaurants and stalls, and usually includes minced meat (beef or chicken, sometimes goat meat mutton along with garlic, egg and onion, and is eaten with curry or gravy, sliced cucumber, syrup-pickled onions or tomato sauce. The dish is sold throughout the country, with diverse variations in ingredients or cooking styles and has been adopted by Malay Muslim sellers as well. In Yemen, murtabak also usually includes goat meat mutton.\n\nThe word mutabbaq in Arabic means \"folded\". This suggests that Murtabak might originate from Yemen, which had a sizeable Indian population; through Indian traders it spread back to their home countries. Murtabak was brought to Southeast Asia by Tamil Muslim traders. The dish referred to as \"murtabak\" is a multi-layered pancake that originated in the state of Kerala where the people referred to as \"mamaks\" (\"mama\" means \"uncle\" in Tamil) hail from. The word \"mutabar\" is the original name for the particular dish referred to in other languages and dialects as \"murtabak.\" \"Mutabar\" is an amalgam of two words, \"muta\" (being the Keralite word for egg, a significant component of the dish) and \"bar,\" an abbreviated form of the word barota, or \"bratha roti\" (the bread). The bread base or pancake on which it is then spread over is referred to in Hindi as \"pratha roti\" or \"pratha.\"\nThere are similar versions of the bread in places such as Yemen and other regions of the Arabic world and Persia. All of these places in the Middle East were visited by Indian traders centuries ago and it would not be unusual for them to have learned from each other or to have adopted each other's culinary habits and practices. However, the word \"mutabar\" is the original name for the egg, chilli, and onion flavoured multi-layered pancake.\n\nMartabak is often called the pancake of asia, consuming martabak in asia has its own unique culture, for instance in south east asia, the dish revolve into referring mar-tabak as a meal stands on their own, and is not supposed to be eaten with noodles or rice in any circumstances.\n\nIn countries where martabak is widely available, it is so common it has become an everyday dish. This dish is made not only at home, but often found in inexpensive food service menus specialising in traditional cuisine, which is why has the reputation of street food. Sometimes martabaki – especially sweet – go on sale in stores already in finished form.\n\nThere are many varieties of martabak. For example, in Brunei, most martabaks are usually not stuffed, instead it is only made of dough (called \"martabak kosong\") similar to Indian Paratha. \"Martabak kosong\" consists of a bread-like dough that is kneaded and prepared similarly to a pancake or other martabak by tossing it into the air, and served piping hot with a sweet curry sauce. In Singapore and Malaysia (where it is called murtabak), the murtabaks are usually filled with spiced beef, chicken or mutton and served with a curry sauce, sweet pickled onions or cucumber in ketchup. Another variant in Malaysia and Singapore is murtabak cheese which uses mozzarella cheese as additional filling. Johorean (Malaysia) and Singaporean murtabak uses more minced meat than most Malaysian murtabak.\n\nThe common ingredients of Indonesian egg martabak, besides the dough, is seasoned ground meat (beef, chicken or mutton), sliced green onions, some herbs (optional), beaten eggs, salt, and potatoes. Some street vendors mix the ground beef with curry seasoning. In Indonesia, the common spices to make the seasoned ground meat are shallots, garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, turmeric, some salt, and sometimes a little bit of monosodium glutamate. All the spices are ground or minced and stir-fried altogether. Some martabak makers add extra ingredients and other varieties to make their martabak unique, but they all share the same main dough. To fry martabak, the chef uses a very large flat frying pan or iron griddle. Usually they use vegetable oil to fry, but it is not uncommon to use ghee or butter too.\n\nBefore serving, martabak usually is cut into portions. Sometimes it is eaten with sweet and salty soy sauce and pepper. Savoury versions of martabak in Indonesia and Malaysia usually are served with acar or pickled condiment consisting of diced cucumber, sliced carrot, shallots, and sliced chillies in sweetened vinegar whereas in Singapore, the condiment consists of sliced cucumbers in tomato ketchup. In Malaysia, Singapore and some areas in Sumatra, martabak is served with \"kari\" (curry) gravy. In Palembang, another variety of martabak is egg-martabak (eggs dropped into the flatten dough before folded while frying) served in curry (usually diced potatoes in beef curry) and topped with chillies in sweet-sour soy sauce called \"Martabak Haji Abdul Rozak\", or more commonly known as \"Martabak HAR\", made popular by an Indian Indonesian named Haji Abdul Rozak. There is also a popular martabak variant from Padang, West Sumatra called \"Martabak Kubang\", which is served with light curry as dipping sauce.\n\nAnother variety of martabak, especially in Malaysia and Sumatra (such as in Jambi, Palembang, and Lampung), is one called \"martabak kentang\" (potato-stuffed martabak). It usually uses the similar dough as other martabak, but it is stuffed with a mix of diced potatoes, beaten eggs, chopped green onions, and spices instead of beaten egg and ground beef. It is eaten by dipping it into hot sweet-sour soy sauce or curry sauce.\n\nAnother variety of martabak is called \"martabak manis\" (sweet martabak), also known by the name \"Terang Bulan\" or \"Martabak Bangka\". This naming however, is only valid in Indonesia, since the identical folded thick pancake is called \"apam balik\" instead in Malaysia.\n\nDespite sharing the same name (because they are both folded), the cooking method, dough (which uses yeast and baking soda), and the ingredients (usually vanilla extract is added as essence) are different from egg martabak, giving it a consistency more like a crumpet. While it is baked on a pan, the sweet martabak is spread with butter or margarine, sugar, crushed peanuts, chocolate sprinkles, cheese or other toppings. Before serving, the martabak is folded in half, so the toppings get in the middle of martabak. In Indonesia, egg martabak is also called \"Martabak Malabar\" to distinguish it from sweet martabak.\n\nThere are many new varieties of \"martabak manis\", including the addition of green tea powder (matcha), cream cheese, Oreo, chocolate candies such as Kit Kat and Nutella.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2116830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116830", "title": "Trajectory optimization", "text": "Trajectory optimization\n\nTrajectory optimization is the process of designing a trajectory that minimizes (or maximizes) some measure of performance while satisfying a set of constraints. Generally speaking, trajectory optimization is a technique for computing an open-loop solution to an optimal control problem. It is often used for systems where computing the full closed-loop solution is not required, impractical or impossible. If a trajectory optimization problem can be solved at a rate given by the inverse of the Lipschitz constant, then it can be used iteratively to generate a closed-loop solution in the sense of Caratheodory. If only the first step of the trajectory is executed for an infinite-horizon problem, then this is known as Model Predictive Control (MPC).\n\nAlthough the idea of trajectory optimization has been around for hundreds of years (calculus of variations, brachystochrone problem), it only became practical for real-world problems with the advent of the computer. Many of the original applications of trajectory optimization were in the aerospace industry, computing rocket and missile launch trajectories. More recently, trajectory optimization has also been used in a wide variety of industrial process and robotics applications.\n\nTrajectory optimization first showed up in 1697, with the introduction of the Brachystochrone problem: find the shape of a wire such that a bead sliding along it will move between two points in the minimum time. The interesting thing about this problem is that it is optimizing over a curve (the shape of the wire), rather than a single number. The most famous of the solutions was computed using calculus of variations.\n\nIn the 1950s, the digital computer started to make trajectory optimization practical for solving real-world problems. The first optimal control approaches grew out of the calculus of variations, based on the research of Gilbert Ames Bliss and Bryson in America, and Pontryagin in Russia. Pontryagin's maximum principle is of particular note. These early researchers created the foundation of what we now call indirect methods for trajectory optimization.\n\nMuch of the early work in trajectory optimization was focused on computing rocket thrust profiles, both in a vacuum and in the atmosphere. This early research discovered many basic principles that are still used today. \nAnother successful application was the climb to altitude trajectories for the early jet aircraft. Because of the high drag associated with the transonic drag region and the low thrust of early jet aircraft, trajectory optimization was the key to maximizing climb to altitude performance. Optimal control based trajectories were responsible for some of the world records. In these situations, the pilot followed a Mach versus altitude schedule based on optimal control solutions.\n\nOne of the important early problems in trajectory optimization was that of the singular arc, where Pontryagin's maximum principle fails to yield a complete solution. An example of a problem with singular control is the optimization of the thrust of a missile flying at a constant altitude and which is launched at low speed. Here the problem is one of a bang-bang control at maximum possible thrust until the singular arc is reached. Then the solution to the singular control provides a lower variable thrust until burnout. At that point bang-bang control provides that the control or thrust go to its minimum value of zero. This solution is the foundation of the boost-sustain rocket motor profile widely used today to maximize missile performance.\n\nThere are a wide variety of applications for trajectory optimization, primarily in robotics: industry, manipulation, walking, path-planning, and aerospace. It can also be used for modeling and estimation.\n\nTrajectory optimization is often used to compute trajectories for quadrotor helicopters. These applications typically used highly specialized algorithms.\nOne interesting application shown by the U.Penn GRASP Lab is computing a trajectory that allows a quadrotor to fly through a hoop as it is thrown. Another, this time by the ETH Zurich Flying Machine Arena, involves two quadrotors tossing a pole back and forth between them, with it balanced like an inverted pendulum.\n\nTrajectory optimization is used in manufacturing, particularly for controlling chemical processes (such as in \n\n) or computing the desired path for robotic manipulators (such as in\n\nThere are a variety of different applications for trajectory optimization within the field of walking robotics. For example, one paper used trajectory optimization of bipedal gaits on a simple model to show that walking is energetically favorable for moving at a low speed and running is energetically favorable for moving at a high speed.\n\nLike in many other applications, trajectory optimization can be used to compute a nominal trajectory, around which a stabilizing controller is built.\n\nTrajectory optimization can be applied in detailed motion planning complex humanoid robots, such as Atlas.\n\nFinally, trajectory optimization can be used for path-planning of robots with complicated dynamics constraints, using reduced complexity models.\nFor tactical missiles, the flight profiles are determined by the thrust and lift histories. These histories can be controlled by a number of means including such techniques as using an angle of attack command history or an altitude/downrange schedule that the missile must follow. Each combination of missile design factors, desired missile performance, and system constraints results in a new set of optimal control parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe techniques to any optimization problems can be divided into two categories: indirect and direct. An indirect method works by analytically constructing the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality, which are then solved numerically. A direct method attempts a direct numerical solution by constructing a sequence of continually improving approximations to the optimal solution. Direct and indirect methods can be blended by an application of the covector mapping principle of Ross and Fahroo.\n\nThe optimal control problem is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem, since the decision variables are functions, rather than real numbers. All solution techniques perform transcription, a process by which the trajectory optimization problem (optimizing over functions) is converted into a constrained parameter optimization problem (optimizing over real numbers). Generally, this constrained parameter optimization problem is a non-linear program, although in special cases it can be reduced to a quadratic program or linear program.\n\nSingle shooting is the simplest type of trajectory optimization technique. The basic idea is similar to how you would aim a cannon: pick a set of parameters for the trajectory, simulate the entire thing, and then check to see if you hit the target. The entire trajectory is represented as a single segment, with a single constraint, known as a defect constraint, requiring that the final state of the simulation match the desired final state of the system. Single shooting is effective for problems that are either simple or have an extremely good initialization. Both the indirect and direct formulation tend to have difficulties otherwise.\nMultiple shooting is a simple extension to single shooting that renders it far more effective. Rather than representing the entire trajectory as a single simulation (segment), the algorithm breaks the trajectory into many shorter segments, and a defect constraint is added between each. The result is large sparse non-linear program, which tends to be easier to solve than the small dense programs produced by single shooting.\n\nDirect collocation methods work by approximating the state and control trajectories using polynomial splines. These methods are sometimes referred to as direct transcription. Trapezoidal collocation is a commonly used low-order direct collocation method. The dynamics, path objective, and control are all represented using linear splines, and the dynamics are satisfied using trapezoidal quadrature. Hermite-Simpson Collocation is a common medium-order direct collocation method. The state is represented by a cubic-Hermite spline, and the dynamics are satisfied using Simpson quadrature.\n\nOrthogonal collocation is technically a subset of direct collocation, but the implementation details are so different that it can reasonably be considered its own set of methods. Orthogonal collocation differs from direct collocation in that it typically uses high-order splines, and each segment of the trajectory might be represented by a spline of a different order. The name comes from the use of orthogonal polynomials in the state and control splines.\n\nPseudospectral collocation, also known as global collocation, is a subset of orthogonal collocation in which the entire trajectory is represented by a single high-order orthogonal polynomial. As a side note: some authors use orthogonal collocation and pseudospectral collocation interchangeably. When used to solve a trajectory optimization problem whose solution is smooth, a pseudospectral method will achieve spectral (exponential) convergence.\n\nDifferential dynamic programming, is a bit different than the other techniques described here. In particular, it does not cleanly separate the transcription and the optimization. Instead, it does a sequence of iterative forward and backward passes along the trajectory. Each forward pass satisfies the system dynamics, and each backward pass satisfies the optimality conditions for control. Eventually, this iteration converges to a trajectory that is both feasible and optimal.\n\nThere are many techniques to choose from when solving a trajectory optimization problem. There is no best method, but some methods might do a better job on specific problems. This section provides a rough understanding of the trade-offs between methods.\n\nWhen solving a trajectory optimization problem with an indirect method, you must explicitly construct the adjoint equations and their gradients. This is often difficult to do, but it gives an excellent accuracy metric for the solution. Direct methods are much easier to set up and solve, but do not have a built-in accuracy metric. As a result, direct methods are more widely used, especially in non-critical applications. Indirect methods still have a place in specialized applications, particularly aerospace, where accuracy is critical.\n\nOne place where indirect methods have particular difficulty is on problems with path inequality constraints. These problems tend to have solutions for which the constraint is partially active. When constructing the adjoint equations for an indirect method, the user must explicitly write down when the constraint is active in the solution, which is difficult to know a priori. One solution is to use a direct method to compute an initial guess, which is then used to construct a multi-phase problem where the constraint is prescribed. The resulting problem can then be solved accurately using an indirect method.\n\nSingle shooting methods are best used for problems where the control is very simple (or there is an extremely good initial guess). For example, a satellite mission planning problem where the only control is the magnitude and direction of an initial impulse from the engines.\n\nMultiple shooting tends to be good for problems with relatively simple control, but complicated dynamics. Although path constraints can be used, they make the resulting nonlinear program relatively difficult to solve.\n\nDirect collocation methods are good for problems where the accuracy of the control and the state are similar. These methods tend to be less accurate than others (due to their low-order), but are particularly robust for problems with difficult path constraints.\n\nOrthogonal collocation methods are best for obtaining high-accuracy solutions to problems where the accuracy of the control trajectory is important. Some implementations have trouble with path constraints. These methods are particularly good when the solution is smooth.\n\nIt is common to solve a trajectory optimization problem iteratively, each time using a discretization with more points. A h-method for mesh refinement works by increasing the number of trajectory segments along the trajectory, while a p-method increases the order of the transcription method within each segment.\n\nDirect collocation methods tend to exclusively use h-method type refinement, since each method is a fixed order. Shooting methods and orthogonal collocation methods can both use h-method and p-method mesh refinement, and some use a combination, known as hp-adaptive meshing. It is best to use h-method when the solution is non-smooth, while a p-method is best for smooth solutions.\n\nExamples of trajectory optimization programs include:\n\nA collection of low thrust trajectory optimization tools, including members of the Low Thrust Trajectory Tool (LTTT) set, can be found here: LTTT Suite Optimization Tools.\n"}

{"id": "2116850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116850", "title": "The Burger King", "text": "The Burger King\n\nThe Burger King is a king character used as the primary mascot for the fast-food restaurant chain of the same name. Throughout the company's history, the king has undergone several iterations. The first iteration of the Burger King was part of a sign at the first Burger King restaurant in Miami, Florida in 1955. Later signs showed the King sitting on a \"burger throne\" as well as atop the BK sign while holding a beverage. In the early 1970s Burger King started using a small and animated version of the King called \"Kurger Bing\" in its children's advertising, voiced by Allen Swift. In 1976, the original animated King was replaced by the \"Marvelous Magical Burger King\" which was a red-bearded and Tudor-era king who ruled the Burger King Kingdom and performed magic tricks that were mostly sleight-of-hand but sometimes relied on camera tricks or involved his \"Magic Ring\" which could summon copious amounts of food. The Burger King Kingdom advertisements were discontinued in the late 1980s in favor of the BK Kids Club Gang and other subsequent advertising programs.\n\nWhen Miami-based advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky took over advertising of Burger King in 2003, they created a caricatured rendition of the Burger King character from the Burger King Kingdom advertising campaign now simply called \"the King\". During the use of CP+B's new version of the Burger King, ads generated significant word of mouth for its new use of what various trade publications and Internet articles labeled \"the Creepy King\" persona, an appellation that BK came to favor and CP+B used in its ads. However, this iteration of the King failed to provide a consistent message regarding the company and its products, prompting the company to terminate its relationship with CP+B upon the takeover of Burger King by 3G Capital in 2010 and announce the following year that the character would be retired.\n\nFive years later, the company brought back the King in May 2015 with a paid appearance as a member of Floyd Mayweather, Jr.'s entourage before the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight. The next was an appearance in the grandstands at the 2015 Belmont Stakes, with the character standing behind Bob Baffert, the horse trainer of American Pharoah. The King returned in 2017 and onward in commercials promoting the new \"Mac and Cheetos\" and flame-grilled Whoppers.\n\nDuring the late 1960s to early 1970s, the Burger King was introduced as a small and animated king character in its children's advertising voiced by Allen Swift and known as Kurger Bing. Kurger Bing was featured in a series of advertisements in which he would visit a Burger King outlet for an interview with a television reporter or see a former court wizard who now worked for the chain. In all ads the King would present children with small gifts or buy them some Burger King food. Many of these commercials featured Kurger Bing reciting the restaurant's slogan, \"Burger King, where kids are king!\"\n\nIn 1976, Kurger Bing was replaced by the \"Marvelous Magical Burger King\" which was a red-bearded and Tudor-era king played by Dick Gjonola, who ruled the Burger King Kingdom and performed magic tricks that were mostly sleight-of-hand but sometimes relied on camera tricks or involved his \"Magic Ring.\" The King was accompanied by usually two or more children and notable characters such as \"Sir Shake-a-Lot\" (a knight that has a craving for milkshakes), the \"Burger Thing\" (a W.C. Fields-esque hamburger portrait), \"The Duke of Doubt\" who often doubted the King's abilities and the robotic \"Wizard of Fries\". This campaign paralleled McDonald's McDonaldland children's commercials, which featured \"Ronald McDonald\", \"The Hamburglar\" and \"Mayor McCheese\" among other characters and mascots. The Burger King Kingdom advertising campaign was discontinued by the late 1980s in favor of the BK Kids Club Gang ads.\n\nAfter Miami-based advertising firm Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B) took over advertising of Burger King on January 27, 2003, they began using a new caricatured iteration of the Burger King character who was simply called \"the King\". During production, an employee at CP+B found a 1970s'-era oversized Burger King head for sale on eBay which was originally used as inspiration for brainstorming; it was eventually decided to restore the head and use it in a campaign. The King appeared in commercials for Burger King starting in 2004. In this incarnation, the King is an unnamed actor who wears an oversized grinning mask that resembles the 1970s version of the Burger King and who often appears in various unexpected places such as in bed with people or behind doors and walls, only to offer them Burger King food. Employing the advertising technique called viral marketing, CP+B's ads generated significant word of mouth for its new use of what various trade publications and Internet articles labeled \"the Creepy King\" persona, an appellation that BK has come to favor and CP+B uses in its ads.\n\nDue to sluggish sales and customer aversion, Burger King retired the 2000s version of the Burger King character in 2011 following a \"food-centric\" marketing approach. Burger King chief financial officer Josh Kobza explained that the reason behind the removal of the \"creepy\" character was because he \"scare[d] away women and children\" from the chain.\n\nThe character returned when Burger King paid $1 million to have him included in Floyd Mayweather, Jr.'s entourage for his May 2015 fight with Manny Pacquiao. The King then appeared in a Burger King commercial for the return of chicken nuggets in June 2015.\n\nHorse trainer Bob Baffert was paid $200,000 to allow The Burger King to stand behind him in the grandstands during the televised broadcast of the 2015 Belmont Stakes, where American Pharoah won the Triple Crown. Baffert had turned down $150,000 to allow the mascot to appear with him at the 2015 Preakness Stakes. The Burger King was also on hand with Baffert when at the 2018 Belmont Stakes, he became the 2nd trainer to win two Triple Crowns with Justify.\n\nIn October 2005, Burger King began to sell Halloween masks resembling The King and Burger King's viral marketing character The Subservient Chicken. There was little promotion on these masks, as Burger King's website had no link to the bkmasks.com website and no commercials were aired advertising them. Nonetheless, the masks quickly sold out, and some masks were also sold on eBay for hundreds of dollars. In October 2006, the masks were again sold for the Halloween season. Unavailable for some time, the masks are now available again through Burger King's online shop.\n\nAlthough the advertisements were mainly shown in North America, advertisements featuring the King surfaced on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom as well as in Germany in early January 2006. The King appeared not to catch on with the UK market and was seemingly retired there after only two brief commercials (featuring him at an ATM and as a pole dancer). However, he returned in summer 2006 as part of Burger King's \"Superman Returns\" campaign.\n\nIn September 2006, Burger King began reusing the animated King character known as Kurger Bing from the late 1960s and early 1970s on its cups, bags and in non-tie-in kids' advertising. This new rendition of Kurger Bing is portrayed as a sarcastic type who sometimes gets in trouble for his mischief-making adventures and appears as a simplistic hand puppet.\n\nIn July 2007, The King appeared in several commercials promoting \"The Simpsons Movie\" as a \"Simpsons\" series character complete with the show's typical traits of four fingers, yellow skin and an overbite.\n\nThe ad campaign for the BK Homestyle Melt sandwiches depicted a group of women, presumably mothers, who have attempted to kill the King through various means such as putting a hit on him or attempting to run him over with a car. It is implied this is done because the new products are moving in on the women's territory, home cooked meals.\n\nThe character has appeared in the tie-in promotion of the film \"\", commercials for a cross-promotions with the NFL and DirecTV's NFL Sunday Ticket sports subscription package.\n\nA further series of advertisements featuring Brooke Burke, which premiered during Super Bowl XL, featured the King orchestrating an elaborate Broadway-style show called \"the Whopperettes\": women dressed as burger condiments and toppings in a Ziegfeld Follies type production. The \"Have it your way\" slogan and \"Creepy King\" comment also made its way into the lyrics.\n\nIn a 2007 commercial to promote the restaurant chain's new Western Whopper sandwich, the King is shown in full royal attire against an obviously fake backdrop of a Southwestern desert, doing a jig-like dance to banjo music. His head is slightly modified so that he wears a handlebar mustache in the style of the Old West, and is juxtaposed with shots of Burger King customers who, upon consuming a Western Whopper, acquire similar mustaches regardless of age or gender.\n\nIn 2007, Burger King introduced a television advertising campaign in which a Burger King restaurant in Las Vegas, Nevada told customers that the company had stopped selling the Whopper sandwich. The ads showed the startled reactions of customers that Burger King would discontinue selling its most popular sandwich. A second round of related commercials showed actual customers who had ordered a Whopper instead being provided with a Big Mac from McDonald's or a hamburger from Wendy's. After the customers complained to the Burger King restaurant manager, the King would emerge from the kitchen with a Whopper on a silver platter.\n\nIn a 2008 commercial, which takes place in the future, a retro-futuristic robot version of the Burger King delivers a new breakfast wrap to a person who is waking up. The purpose of the advertisement was to market Burger King's new Cheesy Bacon BK Wrapper.\n\nAn animated version of the Burger King appears at the beginning of each episode of \"Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy\", sponsored by Burger King, bursting through the movie screen and trying to escape from some kind of danger behind him, such as angry jungle natives, a dramatic explosion, etc.\n\nIn 2009, the Burger King advertised a Kid's Meal cross-promotion with SpongeBob to the tune of \"Baby Got Back\" by Sir Mix-a-lot. The lyrics are replaced by references to \"SpongeBob SquarePants\".\n\nThe Kingons are used to advertise the 2009 \"Star Trek\" film. The advertising and related Kingon Defense Academy web site states that they are an illegitimate offspring between the King and a Klingon woman. The Kingons are a trio of two males and one female that all feature the plastic mask of the King modified with features of the later Klingons, namely head ridges and Fu Manchu mustaches on the two males and the King's crown on all three.\n\nIn 2010, a second attempt was made to launch the King in the UK, with a series of TV and newspaper commercials, starting a few days before his launch, with sneak peeks accompanied by the tag \"He's Coming\".\n\nBeginning in 2005, commercials featuring The King were created by digitally altering classic NFL game footage. The King is superimposed over players, making it appear as though the King was involved in the play. Some of the players the King has been imposed over include Steve Young, Deion Sanders, and Moe Williams (receiving a lateral pass from Randy Moss). He has also been depicted performing the Lambeau Leap and dumping Gatorade on the head of former Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula. These commercials were referenced on the ESPN program \"SportsCenter\", when The King was facetiously dubbed an NFL Rookie Of The Year candidate.\n\nIn August 2006, a commercial debuted showing The King holding a press conference with his \"agent\", Drew Rosenhaus.\n\nThe first appearance of The King in a video game is in the boxing game \"Fight Night Round 3\" from EA Sports, starting with the Xbox 360 release in February 2006. The King is available as the in-ring round guy, and later he is selectable as the player's boxing manager.\n\nIn October 2006, Burger King announced that it would be releasing three video games for the Xbox and Xbox 360 consoles, starring The King and other mascots such as the Subservient Chicken. In \"Pocketbike Racer\", the mascots face off in a minibike race. \"Big Bumpin'\" pits them against each other in a game of bumper cars and finally in \"Sneak King\", players control the King in a third-person perspective stealth game where the King must sneak up behind hungry people and offer them Burger King products. Players are graded on how elaborately they deliver the food.\n\nThe games were available at Burger King restaurants from November 19 to December 24, 2006. They were priced at each ($4.99 Canadian) with purchase of a value meal, and have each been rated \"E for Everyone\" by the ESRB. While the games are now unavailable in stores, Burger King is still selling the games through its online store. Although Dollarama is now selling them for $2.00 each. The games remain priced at $3.99 each, but they are now available as a set for $10.99. All three received low ratings from various game critics.\n\nIn 2008, a series of games were developed by Seattle, Washington based mobile content provider Mobliss. The games, designed to run on mobile phones, were promoted in U.S. locations on menus and packaging. According to Mobliss, the goal of the first game is to become the King's protégé by facing challenges and progressing in the virtual world of a Burger King-themed city. The games could be purchased and downloaded using an SMS shortcode, and were available on all major US carriers that Mobliss had direct publishing agreements with: Sprint Nextel, AT&T Mobility, Verizon Wireless, Alltel, and T-Mobile.\n\n\n"}

It is located on a peninsula created on an oxbow lake, Half Moon Lake, which was part of the former course of the Chippewa River. The park contains baseball, football, and softball venues, as well as the Chippewa Valley Museum.\n\nThe land that became Carson Park was donated in 1914 to the city of Eau Claire by heirs to lumber baron William Carson, and named in his honor. The park was opened the following year. Construction of a sports complex, including a baseball stadium, football stadium and tennis courts, began in 1935 as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project. The first game in the football stadium was played in 1936, and the first game in the baseball stadium was played in 1937.\n\nThe baseball stadium was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.\n\nThe Carson Park baseball stadium hosts the Memorial (Old Abes), North (Huskies), Regis (Ramblers) and Immanuel Lutheran (Lancers) high school teams; the Eau Claire Express of the Northwoods League; the Eau Claire Cavaliers and Eau Claire Bears amateur teams; and the Eau Claire Pizza Hut American Legion team.\n\nThe stadium was formerly the home of the Eau Claire Bears minor league baseball team, a member of the Northern League. The first game was played in the stadium on May 4, 1937, in a Northern League game between the Eau Claire Bears and the Superior Blues.\n\nIn 1954, the Bears were renamed the Braves, after their major league affiliate, the Milwaukee Braves. Among those who played for the Bears/Braves were Hank Aaron, Billy Bruton, Wes Covington, Joe Torre, Bob Uecker, Andy Pafko and others who later played in Major League Baseball.\n\nFollowing the departure of the Braves in the 1960s, the Eau Claire Cavaliers amateur team began play in 1971. Under manager Harv Tomter, the team won five amateur baseball national championships.\n\nA statue honoring Baseball Hall of Fame player Hank Aaron was erected in front of the stadium in 1994. A renovation project around 1997/98 added permanent seats behind home plate, benches in the lower areas of the grandstand, and a remodeled concourse and exterior.\n\nUpon the arrival of the Eau Claire Express Northwoods League franchise in 2005, the stadium underwent further renovations. A fan deck was added in the right field corner, a children's area was added along the third-base foul line near the left field corner, and an electronic message board was added to the scoreboard. The field was re-leveled and re-sodded prior to the 2007 season. The press box was expanded with new sections along the first- and third-base sides for the 2009 season. An auxiliary scoreboard was built on the grandstand roof next to the press box on the third-base side for the 2010 season.\n\nThe left field wall is adjacent to the sideline of the Carson Park football stadium field. During the football season, temporary bleachers from the baseball stadium are positioned on left field with the front of the bleachers placed along the left field wall facing the football field.\n\nCarson Park's football stadium is home of the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire Blugolds, as well as the Memorial, North and Regis high school football teams. It also hosted the now-defunct Chippewa Valley Predators and Eau Claire Crush of the amateur Northern Elite Football League.\n\nThe UW–Eau Claire Blugold football team began play in the stadium in 1937. A tornado that moved through Eau Claire on September 12, 1982 destroyed the press box at the football stadium. A larger, multi-level press box was constructed in the same location. A renovation to the football stadium's grandstand and separate concession/bathroom facilities took place in the late 1990s.\n\nAs more teams used the football field, the condition of the field deteriorated. Beginning in the 1990s, the city attempted several alternative natural grass fields. A solution came in 2004 with the installation of a FieldTurf artificial surface. New turf was again installed in 2015.\n\nThe park has two museums. The Paul Bunyan Logging Camp Museum, which opened in 1934, portrays the town's lumbering history and contains seven authentic logging camp buildings. The Chippewa Valley Museum, opened in 1974, serves as a regional history museum. It contains an old-fashioned ice cream parlor; the one-room Sunnyview School, dating to 1882; and the Anderson Log House, a Norwegian log house built in about 1866, which are situated next to the museum in Carson Park.\n\nThe park also has nature trails and offers other recreational activities. Half Moon Lake is the original home of the Eau Claire Ski Sprites, a water skiing show team, and the Eau Claire Horseshoe Club.\n\nCarson Park displayed the historic locomotive Soo Line 2719 from 1960 to 1996. From Memorial Day through Labor Day, the Chippewa Valley Railroad Association operates the one-half mile, gauge Chippewa Valley Railroad, a ridable miniature railway excursion in the park.\n\n"}

Within the Australian Labor Party, the ASU is aligned with Labor Left. \n\nThe current incarnation of the ASU was formed in 1993 as a result of a three way amalgamation between the Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees Union (MEU), the Federated Clerks' Union (FCU) and the Australian Municipal, Transport, Energy, Water, Ports, Community & Information Services Union, which was also known as the ASU at the time.\n\nThis former incarnation of the ASU was the product of several earlier amalgamations including:\n\nThe amalgamation of these unions occurred as a result of an ACTU policy of encouraging union rationalisation.\n\nWhile the ASU has a single national identity, the union continues to operate in a practical sense through a number of separate state branches. Several of these branches also operate in conjunction with unions that are registered under the industrial relations systems of various states. In Queensland, for example, the two ASU branches are Together and the QSU or Queensland Services Branch, usually known simply as the ASU. The same applies in NSW with the United Services Union (USU) representing Local Government, Clerical and Administrative, Energy, airlines and utilities division, and the NSW Services branch, or simply known as the ASU.\n\nUnion activities are structured into \"industries\": local government, energy and utilities, airlines and transport, social and community services, information technology, and clerical and administration employees.\n\nThe ASU is the principal union in the local government industry nationally. Under the ASU's federal rules, all local government employees are eligible to join the union. In a practical sense, there are differences in the local government occupations that are covered by each state branch. These differences arise out of the differing history of the predecessors of the ASU and whether there were other local government unions in existence at the time of ASU amalgamations. In NSW, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania the ASU or its affiliated state registered unions are the dominant local government unions and represent members in both blue collar or wages areas and white collar or salaried staff. In these states there are other small craft unions. In South Australia and Queensland the ASU only covers salaried staff, whereas blue collar employees are covered by state registered unions that are not affiliated with the ASU - principally the Australian Workers' Union (AWU).\n\nThe ASU is a principal union in this industry nationally. This coverage originally stems from the MEU's and MOA's coverage of employees in the local government industry. At this time responsibility for the utilities - Electricity generation and distribution, Water supply and Sewerage and Sanitation were principally all local government responsibilities. When these responsibilities were assumed by state government instrumentalities, both the MOA and MEU retained coverage of employees.\n\nThe ASU is a significant union in the transport industry, including in airlines, shipping, railways, road transport and in ports. In this industry the ASU covers salaried employees. This coverage is a result of the combined coverage from ATOF, ASTOA, the FCU and various state salaried Railway Officers Unions. The ASU's coverage in ports stems from the MOA.\n\nThe SACS industry has been a significant growth area for the ASU since its amalgamation. The union covers a diverse range of employees in the non-profit community sector, including charities. Coverage of this area stems from the ASWU.\n\nIn this area the ASU represents employees who work as technicians as well as those engaged in IT areas that are related to office administration. The coverage is derived from the TSG and the FCU.\n\nThe ASU has very broad coverage of office workers. In most states this is concentrated around the private sector, except in Queensland where the union has traditionally also covered clerks in Hospitals, University and other public sector areas.\n\n"}

It originated among the secular societies in the 19th century as an alternative to Confirmation by the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. It was especially widespread in East Germany, where state atheism was encouraged under the GDR.\n\nThere are various different groups that organise Jugendweihes in Germany, but the most important ones are the Humanistische Verband Deutschlands (\"Humanist Association of Germany\"), \"Jugendweihe Deutschland e. V.\", and \"die Arbeiterwohlfahrt\" (\"the Worker Welfare\").\n\nToday the term \"Jugendfeier\" is increasingly popular since the \"Humanistischer Verband\" started to use it instead of \"Jugendweihe\" in around the 1980s to mark that participants would not be consecrated but should experience an unforgettable step into adulthood.\n\nBefore the ceremony the youngsters can attend specially arranged events and courses, in which they work on topics like history and multiculturalism, culture and creativity, civil rights and duties, nature and technology, professions and getting a job, as well as lifestyles and human relations. \n\nThe term \"Jugendweihe\" first appeared in 1852, to mark a new form of initiation developed by the secular movements, who developed a course of moral instruction for their children, founded on cultural history, as an alternative to Christian teachings. The concluding \"Jugendweihe\" was above all a ceremony to mark the child's leaving school, and so was held at the age of 14. Since the 1890s the form of the ceremony has remained largely unchanged. The teacher makes a speech about the humanist worldview, the young person makes a pledge, and is given 'pages of remembrance' (\"Erinnerungsblätter\") and a commemorative book. The ceremony is broken up by songs and recitals. This freethinking tradition was absorbed into the labour movement. \n\nDuring the era of National Socialism most of the associations that organised \"Jugendweihen\" were forbidden, but the \"Jugendweihe\" itself was not banned. The Nazi regime tried to establish its own initiation rite for the whole German youth named \"Nationalsozialistische Jugendleite\". \n\nAfter the war the secular communities tried to revive the tradition. \"Jugendweihen\" were continued by small groups in the freethought tradition, in which many representatives of Party and state took part, and despite frequent proposals, \"Jugendweihen\" were not forbidden in the GDR until 1954.\n\nThe decision to convert the \"Jugendweihe\" into a socialist ceremony was taken in Moscow in May 1953 when the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union passed a resolution on \"Measures for the Recovery of the Political Situation in the GDR\", which suggested a socialist alternative to Christian Confirmation. Under heavy Soviet pressure the ceremonies were established alongside confirmation. Even young people with a denominational commitment were expected to take part in the \"Jugendweihe\" ceremonies; those who did not take part would have to contend with significant disadvantages and repression. The first \"Jugendweihe\" took place in East Berlin on 27 March 1955, at which the 14-year-olds were inducted into adulthood and received their identity papers. After the ceremony had taken place they would be addressed with the formal pronoun \"Sie\" (as opposed to the informal \"du\").\n\nFor a year before the actual \"Jugendweihen\" \"youth courses\" were held, which mostly consisted of visits to workplaces, lectures on sexuality and politics, balls or similar social pursuits.\n\nAll participants were invited to the ceremony, which usually took place in a local hall or theatre. After an official speech and the pledge to the socialist State, most were presented with flowers by the Young Pioneers. Until 1974 the state gave every young adolescent the book \"Weltall Erde Mensch\" (Universe, Earth, Man), which contained general knowledge in addition to propagandistic sayings. After 1974 everyone received the purely propagandistic book \"Der Sozialismus - Deine Welt\" (Socialism - Your World) and in the last years of the GDR the book \"Vom Sinn unseres Lebens\" (Of the Meaning of Our Lives) was given. There was also a certificate. After the public ceremony, most of the rest of the day was spent with one's family and classmates.\n\nIn every East German \"Jugendweihe\" the young people would dedicate themselves to the ideals of the state. The pledge was altered five times by the Central Committee throughout its history. The general format of each pledge was the same; the opening, the question of \"\"Are you prepared..?\"\" and the response of \"\"Yes, we pledge!\"\" remained unchanged in each version. As time went past, however, the language of the pledge became ever more overtly patriotic and revolutionary. The first and second alterations of the pledge, made in 1955 and 1956, only made fairly minor changes in wording. The 1958 pledge, however, explicitly required young people to swear to the \"\"great and noble cause of socialism\"\", and to defend peace with the Soviet people, though also with \"\"all peace-loving people in the world\"\". The fourth alteration of the pledge, made on 21 November 1968, was even more revolutionary in tone; it dropped general references such as that to \"\"all peace-loving people\"\", and asked young people to \"\"defend socialism against every imperialist attack\"\". It accepted young people into a community \"\"under the direction of the working class and its revolutionary Party\"\". The final alteration, in 1985 (four years before the fall of the Berlin Wall), was minor in comparison, adding a paragraph in which the attendants pledged to respect and help one another, and extending the closing address, emphasising the \"\"heavy responsibility\"\" conferred on the newly come-of-age.\n\n\n\n"}

Myeik is the largest city in Tanintharyi Region, and serves as the regional headquarters of Myanmar Navy's Tanintharyi Regional Command. The area inland from the city is a major smuggling corridor into Thailand. The Singkhon Pass, also known as the Maw-daung Pass, has an international cross-border checkpoint.\n\nMyeik was the southernmost part of the Pagan Kingdom between the 11th and 13th centuries. After the Pagan Empire's collapse in 1287, Myeik became part of successive Thai kingdoms from the late 13th century to the middle of 18th century: first the Sukhothai Kingdom and later the Ayutthaya Kingdom. A brief period of Burmese rule interrupted this between 1564–93.\n\nFrom the 16th century on, the city was an important seaport and trading center with the Europeans, who would land at Mergui, travel upriver to Tenasserim and then cross the mountains to reach Ayutthaya. The French officer Chevalier de Beauregard was made Governor of the city of Myeik after the Anglo-Siamese war (1687) that resulted in the English being expelled from Siam. De Beauregard was named Governor by Narai, the king of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, replacing an Englishman, Samuel White. The French were then expelled from Myeik following the Siamese revolution of 1688.\n\nThe Burmese captured Myeik in 1765 as part of an invasion that would ultimately topple the Ayutthaya kingdom in 1767. In 1826, the Burmese ceded the region to the British after the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–1826).\n\nIn the Pacific Theater of World War II, Imperial Japanese forces used laborers to construct the Mergui Road to aid their retreat after rail line were destroyed by Allied bombings. \n\nMyeik has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification \"Am\"). Temperatures are very warm throughout the year. There is a short winter dry season (December–January), however, as is typical in locations within this climate regime, this period sees some rain as well. There is a long wet season (February–November), with particularly heavy rain falling from May to September.\n\nThe inhabitants of the city are descended from many ethnic groups, including Bamars, Burmese Indian, Burmese Chinese, Karen, Mon, and Moken. They speak a dialect of the Burmese language known as the Myeik dialect. According to the 2014 census, Myeik has a total population of 284,498. \n\nMyeik's is home to several Burmese pagodas, the largest of which is the Theindawgyi Pagoda.\n\nThe population is engaged in fishing, production of natural rubber and coconuts, manufacture of fermented shrimp paste, the collection of edible bird's nests and pearl farming. Seafood products like dried fish, dried prawn and ngapi (shrimp paste) are other industries. Mergui is a gateway to the 800 offshore islands of the Mergui Archipelago, which are developing a tourist trade.

The two cables connecting to Quay Street were 40-year-old gas-insulated cables that were past their replacement date. One of the Quay Street cables failed on 20 January, possibly due to the unusually hot and dry conditions, although this did not warrant a crisis as the three remaining cables could still supply the central city. The second Quay street cable failed on 9 February, leaving only the Liverpool Street cables supplying the city. Due to the increased load from the failure of the first cables, these remaining two cables failed on 19 and 20 February, leaving the entire central city supplied by a single 22 kV cable from Kingsland, resulting in about 20 city blocks (except parts of a few streets) losing all power.\n\nQueen Street was almost deserted for the first few days, as few businesses could operate. Some brought goods out onto the street to sell, but heavy rain in the first week made that impractical. Generators were brought in from around the country to power essential services and some businesses. These made Queen Street a very noisy place and thus deterred customers. Some businesses estimated that the outage cost them at least NZ$60,000 per week.\n\nIn the five weeks it took to restore the power supply, about 60,000 of the 74,000 people who worked in the area worked from home or from relocated offices in the suburbs. Some businesses relocated staff to other New Zealand cities, or even to Australia. The majority of the 6,000 apartment dwellers in the area had to find alternative accommodation. Temporary power was supplied to the Port of Auckland by the Union Rotorua, a gas turbine powered cargo ship.\n\nThe old gas cables were found to be repairable and were put back into service, but were restricted to 30 MVA capacity. The newer oil cables were irreparable, so to restore full supply to the city, a temporary 110 kV overhead line was constructed along the rail corridor between Penrose and Liverpool Street.\n\nEnergy Minister Max Bradford commissioned an independent report into the Auckland power supply failure. The report of the Ministerial Inquiry was released on 21 July 1998.\n\nFollowing the crisis Mercury Energy Limited disposed of its electricity and gas retail business and, renamed Vector Limited, replaced the cables and reinforced the supply into Auckland. In 2001, a 9 km tunnel from Penrose to Hobson Street via Liverpool Street was completed, containing two new 110 kV cables to replace the damaged Liverpool Street cables and the temporary overhead line. A third 110 kV cable was installed from Mount Roskill to Quay Street via Liverpool Street, largely superseding the old gas cables which were eventually decommissioned.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2116928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116928", "title": "Fontella Bass", "text": "Fontella Bass\n\nFontella Marie Bass (July 3, 1940 – December 26, 2012) was an American R&B and soul singer and songwriter best known for her number-one R&B hit \"Rescue Me\" in 1965. \n\nFontella Bass was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She was the daughter of gospel singer Martha Bass, who was a member of the Clara Ward Singers, and the older sister of R&B singer David Peaston. At an early age, Fontella showed great musical talent. At the age of five, she provided the piano accompaniment for her grandmother's singing at funeral services, she sang in her church's choir at six, and by the time she was nine, she had accompanied her mother on tours throughout the South and Southwest America.\n\nBass continued touring with her mother until age of sixteen. As a teenager, Bass was attracted by more secular music. She began singing R&B songs at local contests and fairs while attending Soldan High School from which she graduated in 1958. At 17, she started her professional career working at the Showboat Club near Chain of Rocks, Missouri. In 1961, she auditioned on a dare for the Leon Claxton carnival show and was hired to play piano and sing in the chorus for two weeks, making $175 per week for the two weeks it was in town. She wanted to go on tour with Claxton but her mother refused and according to Bass \"... she literally dragged me off the train\". It was during this brief stint with Claxton that she was heard by vocalist Little Milton and his bandleader Oliver Sain who hired her to back Little Milton on piano for concerts and recording.\n\nBass originally only played piano with the band, but one night Milton didn't show up on time so Sain asked her to sing and she was soon given her own featured vocal spot in the show. Milton and Sain eventually split up and Bass went with Sain; he also recruited male singer Bobby McClure and the group became known as \"The Oliver Sain Soul Revue featuring Fontella and Bobby McClure\".\n\nWith the support of Bob Lyons, the manager of St. Louis station KATZ, Bass recorded several songs released through Bobbin Records She was produced by Ike Turner when she recorded on his labels Prann and Sonja. Her single \"Poor Little Fool\" released from Sonja in 1964 features Tina Turner. She saw no notable success with these singles. It was also during this period she met and subsequently married the noted jazz trumpeter Lester Bowie.\n\nTwo years later she quit the Milton band and moved to Chicago after a dispute with Oliver Sain. She auditioned for Chess Records, who immediately signed her as a recording artist to the subsidiary label Checker Records. Her first works with the label were several duets with Bobby McClure, who had also been signed to the label. Released early in 1965, their recording \"Don't Mess Up a Good Thing\" (credited to Oliver Sain) found immediate success, reaching #5 on the \"Billboard\" R&B chart and peaking at #33 on the Hot 100. The song was later covered by Ry Cooder and Chaka Khan on Cooder's album \"Bop 'Til You Drop\" (1979).\n\nBass and McClure followed their early success with \"You'll Miss Me (When I'm Gone)\" that summer, a song that had mild success, reaching the Top 30 on the R&B chart, although it made no significant impression on the pop chart. After a brief tour, Bass returned to the studio. The result was an original composition with an aggressive rhythm section; backing musicians on the track included drummer Maurice White (later the leader of Earth, Wind, & Fire), bassist Louis Satterfield and tenor saxophonist Gene Barge, with the young Minnie Riperton among the background singers. That year, Bass co-wrote and recorded the song \"Rescue Me\" which shot up the charts in the fall and winter of 1965. After a month-long run at the top of the R&B charts, the song reached #4 on the US pop charts and #11 in the UK, and gave Chess its first million-selling single since Chuck Berry a decade earlier. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.\n\nBass followed with \"Recovery,\" which did moderately well, peaking at #13 (R&B) and #37 (pop) in early 1966. The same year brought two more R&B hits, \"I Can't Rest\" (backed with \"I Surrender)\" and \"You'll Never Know.\" Her only album with Chess Records, \"The New Look\", sold reasonably well, but Bass soon became disillusioned with Chess and decided to leave the label after only two years, in 1967. Bass claimed that, although the credited co-writers Carl Smith and Raynard Miner, and record producer Billy Davis, had assured her that her contribution to co-writing the lyrics of \"Rescue Me\" would be acknowledged, this was never done.\n\nI had the first million seller for Chess since Chuck Berry about 10 years before. Things were riding high for them, but when it came time to collect my first royalty check, I looked at it, saw how little it was, tore it up and threw it back across the desk.\n\nBass demanded a better royalty rate and artistic control; she approached her then manager Billy Davis about securing her writing credit on the song but was told not to worry about it. When the record came out and her name was still not on it she was told it would be on the legal documents, but this never happened. She continued to agitate about the matter for a couple of years but later recalled: \"It actually side-stepped me in the business because I got a reputation of being a trouble maker.\"\n\nTiring of the mainstream music scene, she and husband Lester Bowie left America and moved to Paris in 1969, where she recorded two albums with the Art Ensemble of Chicago – \"Art Ensemble of Chicago with Fontella Bass\" and \"Les Stances a Sophie\" (both 1970). The latter was the soundtrack from the French movie of the same title. Bass's vocals, backed by the powerful, pulsating push of the band, have allowed the \"Theme De YoYo\" to remain an underground cult classic ever since. She also appeared on Bowie's \"The Great Pretender\" (1981) and \"All the Magic\" (1982).\n\nEven with the success of \"Rescue Me\" it was many years and much litigation before Bass would be credited with her share of the songwriting and the royalties. In 1993 Bass sued American Express and Ogilvy & Mather for the unauthorized use of the song in a commercial for the credit card giant.\n\nThe next few years found Bass at a number of labels, but saw no notable successes. After her second album, \"Free\", flopped in 1972, Bass retired from music and concentrated on raising a family; she had four children with Bowie. She returned occasionally, being featured as a background vocalist on several recordings, including those by Bowie. In 1990, she recorded a gospel album with her mother and brother David Peaston, called \"Promises: A Family Portrait of Faith\" and undertook a fall tour of the US West Coast, called \"Juke Joints and Jubilee\", which featured both traditional gospel and blues performers. During the 1990s, she hosted a short-lived Chicago radio talk show, and released several gospel records on independent labels. In 1992, through her old friend Hamiet Bluiett, she was invited to perform three tracks on the World Saxophone Quartet album \"Breath of Life\".\n\nThe original version of \"Rescue Me\" was used in a TV advertising campaign by American Express. Fontella Bass has stated that she was at a low point in her life when on New Year's Day 1990 she was astonished to hear her own voice singing \"Rescue Me\" on the American Express television ad. The experience gave Bass the inspiration to set her life in order: it also motivated her to make queries over the commercial use of her recording of \"Rescue Me\" with the ultimate result a 1993 settlement with American Express and its advertising agency awarding Bass $50,000 plus punitive damages.\n\nLike many artists of her time, Bass experienced a revival of interest. She was featured on the PBS Special and accompanying DVD, \"Soul Celebration. Soul Spectacular\" recorded live at Heinz Hall in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, November 2001. Her voice can be heard on two tracks on the Cinematic Orchestra's 2002 album \"Every Day\", and another two tracks on their 2007 album \"Ma Fleur\".\n\nIn May 2000, Bass received a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.\n\nIn the 2000s, she toured Europe with her younger brother David Peaston until she fell ill. For her last years she had to struggle due to her deteriorating health. Bass survived breast cancer, a series of strokes beginning in 2005, and also had a leg amputated. On December 26, 2012, she died at a St. Louis hospital from complications of a heart attack suffered earlier in the month; she was 72. She was survived by four children.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Fontella Bass among the hundreds of artists whose audio master tapes were destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\nThe Grammy Awards are awarded annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Bass has received two Grammy nominations.\n"}

Less than 10,000 vehicles a day use various segments of the roadway on average.\n\nThe trunkline was first designated along a portion of its current alignment by 1919. M-61 was extended in segments through 1940, with a truncation at the end of the 1950s. One change in routing in the 1970s resulted in the current routing of the highway.\n\nM-61 starts in eastern Osceola County south of Marion at an intersection with M-115. It runs eastward and meets M-66 before crossing into Clare County. The highway runs along the boundary between the regions of Northern and Central Michigan through forest land and crosses the Muskegon River en route to Harrison. There it follows Main Street into town to an intersection with 1st Street near Budd Lake. M-61 turns south at the intersection and joins the business loop of US 127 (Bus. US 127) through town. Bus. US 127/M-61 follows Clare Avenue south of the city to exit 170 on the US 127 freeway. The business loop ends, and M-61 turns east along Gladwin Road.\n\nThe highway passes south of Wiggins Lake as it approaches the junction with M-18 in Gladwin. The two highways run concurrently on Cedar Avenue for approximately ten blocks through downtown. M-61 leaves town on the east side near the airport. The highway continues eastward to a junction with M-30 (Meridian Road) in White Star on the west banks of the Smallwood Lake section of the Tittabawassee River. The highway crosses the river and runs through Wooden Shoe Village as it continues through the Au Sable State Forest, crossing extreme northern Bay County. The trunkline crosses into Arenac County before meeting I-75 and US 23 in Arenac County near Standish.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains M-61 like all other state trunkline highways in the state. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic along its roadways using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This is a measurement of the traffic along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. The highest traffic level for M-61 in MDOT's 2009 surveys was 9,257 vehicles per day along the Harrison business loop. The lowest AADT was 981 vehicles daily between the Osceola–Clare county line and the Muskegon River crossing. No section of M-61 has been added to the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's defense, economy and mobility.\n\nOn July 1, 1919, when the rest of the state highway system was first signed, M-61 ran between M-18 at Gladwin to M-30 at White Star. A decade later in 1929, M-61 was extended south to Winegars along M-30 and then northeasterly zig-zagging through Highwood and Bentley to Standish. This eastern extension was straightened in 1932, bypassing the route south through Winegars and Bentley to use a direct course between White Star and Standish. At the same time, a second, discontinuous section of M-61 was created when a section of the contemporary M-63 was redesignated M-61 between US 131 at Tustin and M-115 near Marion. At the same time, additional county roads were upgraded to state highways, extending the western M-61 to US 127 in Harrison. The gap between Harrison and Gladwin was eliminated in 1940 when the roadway was built between the two towns. At the end of the 1950s, M-61's designation was removed between M-115 and US 131. The western end was realigned in 1974 to bypass Marion, shortening the route of M-61.\n\n"}

The National Triangle is formed by Commonwealth, Kings and Constitution Avenues. Buildings within the National Triangle have been located and designed intentionally for visual effect, and those of national significance are popular tourist attractions.\n\nThe National Triangle was a significant feature of Walter Burley Griffin's Plan for Canberra. The apices of the triangle are Parliament House, the seat of government; the Defence Headquarters at Russell; and City Hill, representing the civilian part of Canberra. Griffin planned the city around two axes which converge in the centre of the National Triangle. The land axis connects Mount Ainslie, Capital Hill and Red Hill and extends off towards Mount Bimberi the Australian Capital Territory's highest mountain. The water axis runs at right angles to the land axis along the length of Lake Burley Griffin.\n\nThe southern shore of Lake Burley Griffin bisects the National Triangle forming a smaller Triangle known as the Parliamentary Zone bounded by Kings and Commonwealth Avenues.\n\nConsistent with Walter Burley Griffin's Garden City design, the National Triangle is characterised by streets lined with large deciduous trees, and buildings set in expanses of grassed parkland. Consequently, it has a very open feel and buildings are located several minutes walk away from one another. It was Griffin's original intention for more grand government buildings to be located within the precinct, however these have not eventuated as yet.\n\nDevelopment within the National Triangle is strictly controlled by the National Capital Authority – an agency of the Commonwealth Government (not the ACT Government) within the Department of Transport and Regional Services.\n\nThe area covered by the National Triangle corresponds largely with the suburb of Parkes. Parliament House and Old Parliament House are the most significant features within the National Triangle. Other buildings significant to the design and symmetry of the Triangle are the High Court and the National Gallery, located near Lake Burley Griffin, forward of Old Parliament house and to the east, and the National Library and Questacon located forward of Old Parliament House and to the west. Commonwealth Place is located at the centre of the lakeshore and Commonwealth Park and Kings Park line the opposite shore of the lake.\n\nOther significant buildings within the precinct include the Department of the Treasury, the John Gorton Building which houses the Department of Finance and Deregulation and the Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. The National Rose Garden is located beside old Parliament House and the Aboriginal Tent Embassy is located in front of it. Reconciliation Place, a monument to reconciliation between Australia's Indigenous people and the settler population is located near the High Court. The National Archives and 'West Block' - old departmental offices – are located behind the Old Parliament House near Kings Avenue and Commonwealth Avenue respectively. Other government departments, such as the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet are located in the suburb of Barton nearby.\n\nThere are similarities with the design of Canberra and that of Washington, D.C. and Brasília. The three cities consist of triangles that link up the House of Government with other monuments and important places.\n\nThe National Triangle has several dining and recreational facilities which cater to the large number of departmental employees, tourists and Canberra locals. Cafes are located in the National Gallery and National Library. 'The Lobby' located near Old Parliament House and the 'Café in the House' located within it, are restaurants popular with public servants. The Café in the House has recently developed into a trendy bar popular with younger public servants on Friday evenings. The 'Waters Edge' is a restaurant located in Commonwealth Place.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2116960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116960", "title": "Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union", "text": "Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union\n\nThe Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union (CFMMEU, though most commonly still referred to as CFMEU) is Australia's main trade union in construction, forestry, maritime, mining, energy, textile, clothing and footwear production. The CFMMEU is affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, with the Australian Labor Party and with the World Federation of Trade Unions.\n\nThe CFMMEU has offices in all capital cities in Australia and in many major regional centres with the national office of the union being in Melbourne. Before the 2018 merger, the CFMEU had an estimated 120,000 members and employed around 400 full-time staff and officials.\n\nIn March 2018, a two-year long process ended resulting in a merger between the old CFMEU, the Maritime Union of Australia and the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia. The new CFMMEU has a membership of approximately 144,000, 1% of the Australian workforce, with combined assets of $310 million and annual revenue of approximately $146 million.\n\nJohn Setka is the Victorian state secretary of the CFMEU.\n\nThe CFMMEU is structured into four divisions, each operating largely autonomously. Each division has its own discrete set of rules. Members of divisions are also divided into either districts or branches. Elections for office positions within the organisation, for which the term of office is 4 years, are predominantly conducted by the AEC. The Mining and Energy Division, however, holds exemptions from having their elections conducted by the AEC and from the postal ballot provisions under the RO Act. The supreme governing body is the National Conference, which consists of members of each divisional executive. There is also a national executive, National Executive Committee, Divisional Conferences and Divisional Executives.\n\nThe Construction and General Division was formed in the early 1990s with the creation of the national CFMEU. The creation of a single building union had been a policy objective of various building unions for decades with records showing the Queensland Branch of the Operative Painters and Decorators Union (OPDU) carried resolutions calling for a single industry union to be created as early as the 1920s. The rationale behind this policy position was the logical view that members would be better represented by a larger industry-based union rather than the traditional craft unions.\n\nThe largest amalgamating union, the Building Workers' Industrial Union (BWIU) was itself the result of numerous amalgamations over several decades between 1946 and 1992. The coverage of the BWIU included numerous craft unions representing building tradespeople including bricklayers, carpenters, plasterers, tilers, stonemasons and various skilled non-trades construction workers. In the late 1980s the BWIU increased its coverage to include other construction workers such as steel fixers, concreters, construction labourers and trades assistants following the deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF).\n\nThe division also has members working off-site in manufacturing workplaces such as shopfitting workshops, joinery shops and other establishments involved in the pre-fabrication of materials used in the construction process. Members also work in brick, tile and pottery manufacturing and in Queensland, the union covers furnishing trades as there is no formal Forestry Division in the State, due to the Australian Workers' Union's historical coverage of this industry. The Queensland Branch does, however have a presence in Queensland's forestry sector with CFMEU members employed by the State Government working for the Department of Primary Industries.\n\nWith the absorption of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemens Association of Australasia (FEDFA) which had coverage of crane drivers, plant operators, and other construction workers, the Construction and General Division has moved closer to fulfilling the policy objective of creating a single industry union for construction workers.\n\nThe CFMMEU is one of the most powerful unions in the Labor Left faction of the Australian Labor Party.\nThe Construction Division is often associated with the left faction of the Australian labour movement, but during the 2010 Federal election the CFMEU and AMWU donated a total of $60,000 to the Greens.\n\nEach State division operates with autonomy, which results in differing services being offered to members.\n\nThe NSW Branch of the CFMEU General and Construction Division has an estimated 5,000 members and the Victorian Branch around 9,500.\n\nIn August 2010, the CFMEU donated over $1.2 million to political activist group GetUp! to pay for TV airtime for a women's rights ad-spot condemning Tony Abbott and the Liberal Party.\n\nIn the 2013 Election the CFMEU donated $50,000 to the Greens party in the ACT. \n\nIn 2019, the construction division donated $100,000 to the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season recovery effort.\n\nThe CFMMEU Forestry and Furnishing Products Division was first registered as a Federal Organisation 21 August 1907, as the Federated Sawmill, Timber-yard and Woodworkers Employees Association of Australasia.\n\nThe Union's name was changed in 1913 to the Amalgamated Timber Workers Union of Australia, and again in 1918 to the Australian Timber Workers Union.\n\nIn late 1990 a ballot was conducted by members of the Australian Timber Workers Union and the Pulp and Paper Workers Federation of Australia endorsing the amalgamation of both Unions to form the Australian Timber and Allied Industries Union.\n\nAnother ballot was conducted in mid-1991 on the amalgamation between the Australian Timber and Allied Industries Union and the Building Workers Industrial Union. This endorsement supported the first stage in the development of what is now the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. The Forest and Furnishing Products Division represents 20,000 members nationally.\n\nThe Mining and Energy Division consists of a number of unions which have amalgamated. The largest union to contribute to the formation of the division was the Australian Coal and Shale Employees' Federation (ACSEF) (often known as the Miners Federation) which had a continuous history dating back to 1915. Predecessors to the ACSEF had existed on and off since the 1850s.\n\nIndustries covered by the Mining and Energy Division include the coal industry, coal ports, the metalliferous mining industry, electric power generation, oil and gas and the small coke industry.\n\n\nThe Maritime Union of Australia Division consists of the amalgamated Maritime Union of Australia. As of 2017, the division represents 16,000 workers associated with Australian ports.\n\nIn September 2019, the MUA division announced that it would go on strike during the global Climate Strike during September 20, being \"the first known instance of workers taking industrial action to attend the rallies\".\n\nIn the 2018 Victorian Election, the Maritime Union of Australia Division donated an unknown amount to the Victorian Socialists campaign.\n\nIn 2001, the Howard Government set up the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry (commonly known as the \"Cole Royal Commission\"). The Commission and its findings were largely condemned by the Labor Party and the Greens which argued that the terms of reference were too narrow. The CFMEU asserted that the purpose of the Commission was a \"witch-hunt\" to reduce the power of the CFMEU rather than to investigate crime. The General and Construction Division of the union stopped some corruption within the union. Justice Cole found 392 cases of unlawful conduct; 98 cases were passed on to prosecution authorities by the Commonwealth Attorney-General, of which 26 were considered breaches of criminal law.\n\nAs a result of the Commission's findings the Howard Government established the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner (commonly known as the ABCC) in 2005. It had a wide range of powers, including compelling testimony under oath, with penalties of up to $22,000 for individuals and $110,000 for corporations and unions apply for breaches of the \"Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005\". The ABCC was abolished in 2012 by the Gillard Government and was replaced by the Fair Work Building and Construction. In 2015 the Abbott Government attempted to reinstate the ABCC, but the legislation failed to pass the two houses of Parliament. A further attempt to pass the legislation was unsuccessfully made by the Turnbull Government in March 2016. After the two failed attempts to reintroduce the ABCC, in December 2016 Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called the double dissolution 2016 federal election. Following the election, the reelected Turnbull Government was successful in reinstating the ABCC with the vote of Senators Pauline Hanson's One Nation, Nick Xenophon Team and Derryn Hinch.\n\nUnder WorkChoices, situations where industrial action could take place were reduced. The CFMEU and workers had to prove a workplace was unsafe to put a stop to work on a site which has not happened to date.\n\nDuring 2011 and 2012, BHP Coal and its employees were negotiating about a new enterprise agreement to apply to BHP Coal's operations at various mines, including the Saraji mine. For the purpose of supporting or advancing their claims, employees of BHP Coal took protected industrial action in the form of work stoppages and overtime bans. There was a seven-day work stoppage between 15 and 22 February 2012. During this stoppage, members of the CFMEU who were employed at the Saraji mine, including Mr Doevendans, participated in protests beside the road leading into the mine property. Standing behind barriers BHP Coal had erected at the side of the road, the protesters held up signs which the CFMEU had provided and waved the signs at those who were driving into the mine. The signs were directly or indirectly critical of BHP Coal and of those who were driving into the mine. On four occasions over three days, Mr Doevendans held up a sign that read: \"No principles Scabs No guts.\" Some employees of BHP Coal complained to management about the scabs sign. Following some interactions with management, Mr Doevendans' employment with BHP was terminated.\n\nOn appeal to the High Court of Australia, it was held that the dismissal of Mr Doevendans was permissible under the \"Fair Work Act 2009\".\n\nThe federal division of the Federated Saw Mill, Timber Yard and General Wood Workers Employees' Association changed its name to the Amalgamated Timber Workers' Union of Australia. The former union had been registered federally in 1907 and had registered branches in Victoria, Adelaide, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania. Although the organisation was deregistered in 1918 its members formed a new union, the Australian Timber Workers' Union, the same year. The new union extended coverage to workers in box and case factories, saw makers' shops, joiners' workshops, carpenters, implement workers and wood-working machinists. In 1940 the union filed an application and succeeded in extending its coverage to most workers employed in the timber and wood industry including cabinet makers and furniture factories. In 1991 it amalgamated with the Pulp & Paper Workers' Federation of Australia to form the Australian Timber & Allied Industries Union. Later in the year amalgamation with the Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia created the ATAIU & BWIU Amalgamated Union. Further amalgamations eventually saw this organisation become part of the Construction Forestry Mining & Energy Union in 1993.\n\nSince late 2015, the Maritime Union of Australia and CFMEU have been in merger talks to create 'Australia's most powerful union'.\n\nOn 29 February 2016 at the MUA national conference, delegates voted unanimously in favour of negotiations for a merger with the CFMEU. In August 2017, the Turnbull government introduced tough new laws targeting the CFMEU, with broad powers to deregister unions, disqualify officials and block unions from merging if they repeatedly breach industrial laws. The proposed law failed to pass the Senate. The Fair Work Commission approved the merger in March 2018 of the CFMEU, MUA and the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia (TCFUA). The merger had been opposed by business groups, including Master Builders Australia, and by the federal government. In November 2018, the Australian Mines and Metals Association appealed to the Federal Court of Australia against the merger. The appeal was dismissed in December.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2116972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2116972", "title": "Nkisi", "text": "Nkisi\n\nNkisi or Nkishi (plural varies: \"minkisi\", \"zinkisi\", or \"nkisi\") are spirits, or an object that a spirit inhabits. It is frequently applied to a variety of objects used throughout the Congo Basin in Central Africa especially in the Territory of Cabinda that are believed to contain spiritual powers or spirits. The term and its concept have passed with the Atlantic slave trade to the Americas.\n\nThe current meaning of the term derives from the root, \"*-kitį\"- referring to a spiritual entity, or material objects in which it is manifested or inhabits in Proto-Njila, an ancient subdivision of the Bantu language family.\n\nIn its earliest attestations in Kikongo dialects in the early seventeenth century it was transliterated as \"mokissie\" (in Dutch), as the mu- prefix in this noun class were still pronounced. It was reported by Dutch visitors to Loango, current territory of Cabinda, in the 1668 book \"Description of Africa\" as referring both to a material item and the spiritual entity that inhabits it. In the sixteenth century, when the Kingdom of Kongo was converted to Christianity, \"ukisi\" (a substance having characteristics of nkisi) was used to translate \"holy\" in the Kikongo Catechism of 1624.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the \"mu-\" prefix evolved into a simple nasal \"n-\", so the modern spelling is properly n'kisi, but many orthographies spell it nkisi (there is no language-wide accepted orthography of Kikongo).\n\nClose communication with ancestors and belief in the efficacy of their powers are closely associated with minkisi in Kongo tradition. Among the peoples of the Congo Basin, especially the Bakongo and the Songye people of Kasai, exceptional human powers are frequently believed to result from some sort of communication with the dead. People known as banganga (singular: nganga) work as healers, diviners, and mediators who defend the living against black magic (witchcraft) and provide them with remedies against diseases resulting either from witchcraft or the demands of bakisi (spirits), emissaries from the land of the dead.\n\nBanganga harness the powers of bakisi and the dead by making minkisi. Minkisi are primarily containers - ceramic vessels, gourds, animal horns, shells, bundles, or any other object that can contain spiritually-charged substances. Even graves themselves, as the home of the dead and hence the home of bakisi, can be considered as minkisi. In fact, minkisi have even been described as portable graves, and many include earth or relics from the grave of a powerful individual as a prime ingredient. The powers of the dead thus infuse the object and allow the nganga to control it. The metal objects commonly pounded into the surface of the power figures represent the minkisis' active roles during ritual or ceremony. Each nail or metal piece represents a vow, a signed treaty, and efforts to abolish evil. Ultimately, these figures most commonly represent reflections upon socially unacceptable behaviors and efforts to correct them.\n\nThe substances chosen for inclusion in minkisi are frequently called \"\"bilongo\"\" or \"\"milongo\"\" (singular \"nlongo\") a word often translated as \"medicine.\" However, their operation is not primarily pharmaceutical, as they are not applied to or ingested by those who are sick, and perhaps \"bilongo\" is more accurately translated as \"therapeutic substances\". Rather they are frequently chosen for metaphoric reasons, for example, bird claws in order to catch wrongdoers, or because their names resemble characteristics of spirits in question.\n\nAmong the many common materials used in the minkisi were fruit (\"luyala\" in Kikongo), charcoal (\"kalazima\"), and mushrooms (\"tondo\"). Minerals were collected from various places associated with the dead, such as earth collected from graves and riverbeds. White clay was also very important in the composition of minkisi due to the symbolic relationship of the color white and the physical aspects of dead skin as well as their moral rightness and spiritual positivity. White contrasted with black, the color of negativity. Some minkisi use red ochre as a coloring agent. The use of red is symbolic of the mediation of the powers of the dead.\n\nMinkisi serve many purposes. Some are used in divination practices, rituals to eradicate evil or punish wrong-doers, and ceremonies for protective installments. Many are also used for healing, while others provide success in hunting or trade, among other things. Important minkisi are often credited with powers in multiple domains. Most famously, minkisi may also take the form of anthropomorphic or zoomorphic wooden carvings.\n\nMinkisi and the afflictions associated with them are generally classified into two types; the \"of the above\" and the \"of the below\". The above minkisi are associated with the sky, rain, and thunderstorms. The below minkisi are associated with the earth and waters on land. The above minkisi were considered masculine and were closely tied to violence and violent forces. The minkisi of the above were largely used to maintain order, serve justice, and seal treaties.\n\nBirds of prey, lightning, weapons, and fire are all common themes among the minkisi of the above. They also affected the upper body. Head, neck, and chest pains were said to be caused by these nkisi figures. Some figures were in the form of animals. Most often these were dogs (\"\"kozo\"\"). Dogs are closely tied to the spiritual world in Kongo mythology. They live in two separate worlds; the village of the living, and the forest of the dead. \"Kozo\" figures were often portrayed as having two heads – this was symbolic of their ability to see both worlds.\n\nNkondi (plural varies \"minkondi\", \"zinkondi\") are a subclass of minkisi that are considered aggressive. Because many of the nkondi collected in the nineteenth century were activated by having nails driven into them, they were often called \"nail fetishes\" in travel writing, museum catalogs, and art history literature. Many nkondi also feature reflective surfaces, such as mirrors, on their stomach areas or the eyes, which are held to be the means of vision in the spirit world. Although they can be made in many forms, the ones featuring a human statue with nails are the best described in anthropological and scholarly literature.\n\nNkondi are invoked to search out wrongdoing, enforce oaths, and cause or cure sicknesses. Perhaps the most common use was the locating and punishing of criminals, by hunting down wrongdoers and to avenging their crimes. An oath taker may declare him or herself vulnerable to the disease caused by an nkondi should he or she violate the oath. People who fall sick with diseases known to be associated with a particular nkondi may need to consult the nganga responsible for mediating with that spirit to determine how to be cured.\n\nAlthough nkisi nkondi have probably been made since at least the sixteenth century, the specifically nailed figures, which have been the object of collection in Western museums, nailed nkondi were probably made primarily in the northern part of the Kongo cultural zone in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nThe nkisi figures brought back to Europe in the nineteenth century caused great interest in stimulating emerging trends in modern art, and Bantu themes previously considered primitive or gruesome were now viewed as aesthetically interesting. The pieces became influential in art circles and many were acquired by art museums. The intentions of the banganga who created minkisi were practical, that is their characteristics were dictated by the need of the object to do the work it was required to do—hence the nails which caused a sensation were never seen as decorative items but as a requirement of awakening the spirit; or the gestures were part of a substantial metaphor of gestures found in Kongo culture.\n\nRecently some modern artists have also been interested in creating nkisi of their own, most notably Renee Stout, whose exhibition \"Astonishment and Power\" at the Smithsonian Institution coupled her own versions of nkisi with a commentary by noted anthropologist Wyatt MacGaffey.\n\nThe Republic of the Congo artist, Trigo Piula had painted several items in a ‘New Fetish’ series, due to rebuffing of traditional fetish by people. It \" is a way of engaging with my community and a way of denouncing things that I believe are impacting us, like television for example \", he said.\n\n"}

That year, Severyanin (his pen name means \"Northerner\" in Russian) brought out a collection entitled \"The Cup of Thunder\" (\"Громокипящий кубок\"), with a preface written by Fyodor Sologub.\n\nIn one of his most celebrated poems, Lotaryov introduced himself to the readers with the following words: \"I am Igor Severyanin, a genius!\" He soon gained a cult following, especially in the provinces of Imperial Russia. The poet \"captured the popular imagination and reached stardom with his slick pomaded hair parted in the middle; his melancholy, darkly circled eyes; his impeccable tails; and an ever-present lily in his hands\".\n\nSeveryanin's poems treated such extraordinary themes as \"ice cream of lilacs\" and \"pineapples in champagne\", intending to overwhelm the bourgeois audience with a riot of colors and glamour associated by them with high society. In his verse, Severyanin admired dirigibles and automobiles, everything that could convey to his followers the notion of modernity. He would often shock the public by professing his admiration for Oscar Wilde or scandalize his emulators with cynical statements and megalomania. During one party, they declared Severyanin \"the king of poets\", although some respected critics professed their distaste for his work.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, Severyanin was one of the first poets to leave Russia. Having settled in Estonia in 1918, he tried to return to Russia afterwards, but could not for various reasons (namely, the civil war, his marriage to a local woman (Felissa Kruut), unreceptive literary climate in Soviet Russia, etc.). After the Soviet occupation of Estonia, 1940 Severyanin continued literary activities, and later died of a heart attack in the German occupied Tallinn in 1941. He was buried in Alexander Nevsky cemetery, Tallinn.\n\n"}

Jean-Pierre Léaud, comic star of numerous French New Wave films including Truffaut's \"Les Quatre Cent Coups (The Four Hundred Blows)\" and Godard's earlier \"Masculin Féminin\", appeared in two roles. Raoul Coutard served as cinematographer; \"Weekend\" was his last collaboration with Godard for over a decade.\n\nThe film was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 18th Berlin International Film Festival in 1968.\n\nRoland (Jean Yanne) and Corinne (Mireille Darc) are a bourgeois couple. Each has a secret lover and conspires to murder the other. They drive out to Corinne's parents' home in the country to secure her inheritance from her dying father, resolving to resort to murder if necessary.\n\nThe trip becomes a chaotically picaresque journey through a French countryside populated by bizarre characters and punctuated by violent car accidents. After their own Facel-Vega is destroyed in a collision, they wander through a series of vignettes involving class struggle and figures from literature and history, such as Louis Antoine de Saint-Just (Jean-Pierre Léaud) and Emily Brontë (Blandine Jeanson).\n\nWhen Corinne and Roland eventually arrive at her parents' place, they discover that her father has died and her mother refuses to give them a share of the spoils. They kill her and hit the road again, only to fall into the hands of a group of hippie revolutionaries (calling themselves the Seine and Oise Liberation Front) that support themselves through theft and cannibalism. Killed during an escape attempt, Roland is chopped up and cooked.\n\n\nAccording to a letter from the Argentine writer Julio Cortázar to his translator Suzanne Jill Levine, the indirect inspiration for the movie was Cortázar's short story \"The Southern Thruway.\" Cortázar explained that while a British producer was considering filming his story, a third party presented the idea to Godard, who was unaware of its source. Because he had had no input on the making of the film, Cortázar vetoed the suggestion to translate the story's title as \"Week-End\" to take advantage of the tie-in.\n\n\"Weekend\" has been compared to \"Alice in Wonderland\", the \"James Bond\" series, and the works of Marquis de Sade. Tim Brayton described it as a \"film that reads itself, tells the viewer what that reading should be, and at the same time tells the viewer that this reading is inaccurate and should be ignored.\"\nIn one of the first scenes Corinne tells her lover about a sexual experience she had. Part of the story she tells is based on George Bataille novel \"Story of the eye\" (\"Histoire de l'œil\"). \n"}

{"id": "2117087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117087", "title": "WMC-TV", "text": "WMC-TV\n\nWMC-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 5, is an NBC-affiliated television station licensed to Memphis, Tennessee, United States. The station is owned by Gray Television. WMC-TV's studios are located on Union Avenue in midtown Memphis, and its transmitter is located between Crestview Drive and Fletcher Creek, near Bartlett. The station serves roughly the western third of Tennessee, northern Mississippi, eastern Arkansas and the southeastern corner of Missouri over the air, on satellite, and on various cable systems.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on December 11, 1948 as WMCT, broadcasting on VHF channel 4 as the first television station in Tennessee. The station originally broadcast from studios located inside the Goodwin Institute Building in Downtown Memphis. It was owned by the E. W. Scripps Company, along with the city's main newspaper, \"The Commercial Appeal\" and WMC radio (AM 790 and FM 99.7). As the only television station in Memphis for its first several years of operation, WMCT aired programming from all four national networks of the time: NBC, CBS, ABC and the now-defunct DuMont Television Network. However, it carried NBC as a primary affiliation, owing to WMC-AM's longtime affiliation with the NBC Red Network. It lost CBS programming when WHBQ-TV (channel 13) signed on in September 1953, but continued to share ABC programming with WHBQ until January 1956, when WREC-TV (channel 3, now WREG-TV) launched as a full-time CBS affiliate with WHBQ taking over the ABC affiliation full-time. It lost DuMont when that network ceased operations in 1956. During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.\n\nThe station moved to VHF channel 5 on November 23, 1952, because of Channel 4 interference with fellow NBC affiliate WSM-TV in Nashville (now WSMV) also on Channel 4; however, this would later make WMCT short-spaced to another Nashville station, WLAC (now WTVF), when that station signed on in 1954. Since at least the 1950s, WMC-TV's logo has included an illustration of a riverboat, a symbol of the Mississippi River region which the station serves. For many years, the station's sounder included the riverboat's whistle—something which dates to the 1930s on its former AM sister. The whistle is still heard at the opening of WMC-TV's current newscasts. The station was known as \"The Showplace of the South\" during the 1960s. It dropped the \"T\" from its callsign (simultaneously tacking on the \"-TV\" suffix to it) on January 1, 1967 (at the same time, the co-owned FM station changed its call letters from WMCF to WMC-FM). Also in 1967, it began using a \"5\" logo resemblance to the numerical typeface found on a five-dollar bill, which would be used for over two decades.\nThe WMC stations moved to their current location at 1960 Union Avenue in Midtown Memphis in 1959 and celebrated with a broadcast hosted by comedian George Gobel. In 1960, the stations broadcast live remotes of John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, who both came to Memphis to campaign for the presidency. When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. came to Memphis to support the sanitation workers' strike that set the stage for his assassination in 1968, then-station general manager Mori Greiner established an unprecedented program called \"The 40% Speaks\", in an effort to promote racial healing in the community. In an odd illustration of how little real integration had occurred in local television, the first host of this program was news anchor Dave Patterson, who himself was Caucasian. When Patterson left WMC-TV, his replacement was a white professor from Memphis State University, now the University of Memphis.\n\nAfter many years of solid management, Scripps sold WMC-AM-FM-TV to Atlanta businessman Bert Ellis in 1993. The graphics package that introduced this logo was adopted when the then newly formed Ellis Communications purchased WMC-TV and several other stations in 1993. Ellis was a longtime fan of his hometown's long-dominant station, WSB-TV, and styled his new broadcast group after that station. Under Ellis, channel 5 adopted a blue-and-gold color scheme similar to the one used then as now by WSB-TV. Two of WMC's siblings adopted the logo style as well: KSLA-TV in Shreveport, Louisiana and WECT in Wilmington, North Carolina. All three stations use modified versions of the same logo style today. \n\nEllis, in turn, sold the stations to a new broadcasting group formed by the Retirement Systems of Alabama, and subsequently named Raycom Media (that also purchased AFLAC's broadcasting unit), in 1996; Raycom sold off the radio stations to Infinity Broadcasting in 2000. (They are now owned by Entercom.)\n\nOn June 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom's 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including WMC-TV), and Gray's 93 television stations) under Gray's corporate umbrella. The cash-and-stock merger transaction valued at $3.6 billion—in which Gray shareholders would acquire preferred stock currently held by Raycom – will result in WMC-TV gaining new sister stations in nearby markets, including the Knoxville duopoly of CBS affiliate WVLT-TV and CW affiliate WBXX-TV (currently Gray's only Tennessee properties; also while separating it from WTNZ) and ABC/CW affiliate WTOK-TV in adjacent Meridian, Mississippi, in addition to its current Raycom sister stations. The sale was approved on December 20, and was completed on January 2, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWMC-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, at 12:01 a.m. on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 52, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era VHF channel 5 for post-transition operations.\n\nSyndicated programming seen on WMC-TV includes \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\", and \"Wheel of Fortune\", among others. The syndicated version of \"Jeopardy!\" was originally carried locally on WMC-TV, but has since moved to CBS affiliate WREG-TV, making the Memphis area one of the few TV markets to air \"Wheel\" and \"Jeopardy!\" on separate stations. \"Rachael Ray\" and \"The Dr. Oz Show\" were originally broadcast on WMC-TV, but neither show currently airs in the Memphis market.\n\nLike many NBC affiliates from the 1960s through the 1990s, WMC-TV began preempting a handful of NBC programs, mostly a sizeable portion of the network's daytime lineup, in favor of syndicated talk shows, although NBC's daytime reruns of sitcoms would often continue to air in the early morning hours (between 5 and 6 a.m.). In 1979, in an effort to build its viewership for \"The Today Show\", WMC created a lead-in morning program titled \"Wake-Up Call\". For the first three years, it was hosted by Dick Hawley and Peggy Rolfes. Denise DuBois replaced Rolfes in 1982 and co-hosted for the next ten years. By the mid-1980s, \"Wake Up Call\" was the highest-rated talk show on local television in the U.S., with a 52% share of the viewing audience.\n\nA popular local program on WMC-TV was \"Magicland\", a live-audience magic series for children, hosted by anchor/announcer Dick \"Mr. Magic\" Williams, which aired Sunday mornings at 10 a.m. from 1966 until Williams's retirement in 1989. It is cited in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as the longest-running magic series in television history, having amassed 1,200 original episodes in its 23-year run.\n\nOne of the station's first broadcasts was a football game at Crump Stadium in Memphis. WMCT first broadcast what was then known simply as \"Championship Wrestling\" (later to become \"USWA Championship Wrestling\" in 1989) by stringing cables across the street from its studio to the since-demolished Ellis Auditorium in downtown Memphis early in the 1950s. Wrestling returned to Channel 5 in 1977, after several years on WHBQ-TV, and for many years the very popular live in-studio professional wrestling program was broadcast live on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Some of the wrestlers became regional celebrities from their exposure on the program, including Jerry \"The King\" Lawler, whose fame earned him his own locally produced Sunday sports program on channel 5 during the 1980s. \"USWA Championship Wrestling\" eventually became the last remaining program of its kind in the U.S., before its cancellation in 1997. Long before national PGA Tour broadcasts began, WMC-TV broadcast live professional golf from the Memphis Open, with a three-camera remote truck providing coverage from three greens.\n\nWMC-TV presently broadcasts 44 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday, and 4½ hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station's newsroom is named after longtime employee Ed Greaney, who died on June 19, 2005. Greaney started working at WMCT in 1949, only two months after the station signed on and worked at channel 5 until retiring in late 2000.\n\nAppropriately for a station founded by a newspaper, WMC-TV has a strong local news tradition. For the better part of its first four decades on the air, it was the dominant station in Memphis. However, rival WREG closed the gap in the late 1980s, and for the next two decades the two stations waged a spirited battle in the Nielsen ratings. WREG would not overtake WMC until the February 2006 sweeps period with the appointment of former WHBQ anchor Claudia Barr and former WMC morning anchor Richard Ransom as its evening anchors. Since that time, WREG has beaten WMC in the mornings, at 10 p.m. and on weekends. For the May 2013 sweeps period, WREG's newscasts beat WMC's in most timeslots (except at 5 and 6 p.m.), while WMC beat WREG in the 6 p.m. timeslot by .3 of a point. During the February 2014 sweeps, WMC fell to second place in all timeslots, trailing WREG by several points.\n\nIn October 2006, WMC debuted an overhauled news set (the first set update since 1995), along with an updated graphics and music package. On July 2, 2008, WMC-TV became the first television station in the Memphis market and the second in Tennessee (behind WTVF in Nashville) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.\n\nOn August 22, 2011, WMC-TV debuted an hour-long 4 p.m. newscast, which replaced \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" (which ended its run in May of that year) and competes against WREG's newscast in the same timeslot. On June 26, 2013, WMC-TV debuted an hour-long weekday morning newscast from 7–8 a.m. on its Bounce TV-affiliated second digital subchannel with a heavy emphasis on weather and traffic updates. The 7–8 a.m. Bounce newscast ended in 2017. On September 10, 2018, WMC-TV expanded its weekday morning newscast with an extra half-hour starting at 4 a.m.\n\n\nWMC-TV was historically the default NBC affiliate on cable and over-the-air in two neighboring media markets—Jackson, Tennessee and Jonesboro, Arkansas, as NBC never affiliated with any stations in either of these markets. In 2014, WNBJ-LD signed on the air as the Jackson area's own NBC affiliate. WMC-TV remains intact on the area's cable system of the Jackson Energy Authority. That system also carried Nashville's WSMV until the sign-on of WNBJ. \n\nIn late January 2015, WMC's ABC-affiliated sister station KAIT (channel 8) in Jonesboro converted their second subchannel, KAIT-DT2, into an NBC affiliate for the Jonesboro area. In addition, WMC-TV's over-the-air signal still provides city-grade coverage into both Jonesboro and Jackson. The central and southern portions of the two southernmost counties in the Missouri Bootheel can also still pick up WMC-TV's signal.\n\n"}

At the summit is a large Cairn believed to be the burial chamber of Queen Maebh of Connacht. Although it has not been excavated, it is believed to conceal a Neolithic passage tomb.\n\nKnocknarea is an \"anglicisation\" of an Irish name. \"Cnoc\" means \"hill\", but the etymology of the rest of the name is disputed. Both P.W. Joyce and W.G. Wood-martin (historians) noted (citing ,multiple sources), that the overwhelming consensus is that \"Conc Na Riadh\" is the intended Irish language version and translates to \"hill of executions\". \"Cnoc na Riogha\" (\"hill of the kings\") has also been suggested , as has \"Cnoc na Ré\" (\"hill of the moon\") . The Placenames Database of Ireland gives the Irish name as \"Cnoc na Riabh\" (meaning \"hill of the stripes\"). however this has proven to be a notoriously unreliable and controversial reference.\n\nOn the summit of Knocknarea is a large cairn about wide and high, making it the largest such cairn in Ireland outside the Brú na Bóinne complex in Meath. Although it remains unexcavated, and is one of the biggest of such monuments still unexplored, it has many of the features of a classic passage tomb. It is known in Irish as \"Meascán Méabha\" or \"Miosgan Meadhbha\" meaning Medb's Lump (Miosgán means a lump or pat, especially of butter). In English it is known variously as Medb's Cairn, Medb's Tomb, Medb's Nipple or Medb's Grave (sometimes the name Medb is anglicized as Maeve). It is believed to date to around 3000 BCE. Meabh is a figure in Irish mythology who features in stories dating to the early first millennium CE. Archaeologist Stefan Bergh, in his book \"Landscape of the Monuments\" (Stockholm 1995), suggests that a large depression some distance to the west of the mound was the quarry from which the limestone for the monument was taken.\n\nMeabh's Cairn, though by far the largest, is only one of a number of monuments on the summit of Knocknarea. In general the tombs are lined up North-South, and they may have been constructed to face Carrowmore in the lowlands. Many of the smaller tombs seem to have been small passage tombs; they were severely damaged by the excavations of antiquarians in the 19th century.\nKnocknarea seems to have been a major place of ritual and meeting in the Neolithic era. The entire top of the mountain on the eastern side is circumscribed by a -long embankment, wide and tall. Hut sites have been located on the inside of this area. A large amount of debris from making stone tools has been collected.\n\nThe area around Sligo Bay is rich in pre-historic remains, and shares similar monuments and natural shapes. From Knocknarea can be seen other sites such as Croaghaun Mountain, Carrowkeel Megalithic Cemetery, and Cairns Hill. Carrowmore passage tomb cemetery is located at the eastern foot of Knocknarea.\n\nStrandhill, the coastal resort, lies at the western foot of Knocknarea. Cullenamore, an extensive beach area, is further south, and the southern aspect from Knocknarea overlooks Ballysadare Bay.\n\nConservation issues regarding Knocknarea and Meabh's Cairn have been discussed in the local press. Large visitor numbers are causing damage to the cairn. Visitors are asked not to climb on the cairn, and not to take stones from the cairn.\n\n"}

Tascam is credited as the inventor of the Portastudio, the first cassette-based multi-track home studio recorders. Tascam also introduced the first low-cost mass-produced multitrack recorders with Simul-Sync designed for recording musicians. Tascam also manufactured reel-to-reel tape machines and audio mixers for home recordists from the early 1970s through the mid-1990s.\n\nTascam started out as a research and development group to research how to use TEAC's recording technology in musician and recording studio products. The group was called TASC (TEAC Audio Systems Corp). The founders included Mr. K. Tani, one of the founders of TEAC-Japan and Dr. Abe, a senior TEAC-Japan engineer. In 1971 TASCAM (TASC AMerica Corp.) was founded to distribute TASC products in the U.S. It also conducted additional market research in the US for the Japanese parent company.

Together with Ted Nelson he contributed to the first hypertext system, Hypertext Editing System (HES) in the late 1960s. He co-authored \"\" along with J.D. Foley, S.K. Feiner, and John Hughes. He also co-founded the precursor of today's ACM SIGGRAPH conference.\n\nVan Dam serves on several technical boards and committees. He teaches an introductory course in computer science and courses in computer graphics at Brown University.\n\nVan Dam received his B.S. degree with Honors in Engineering Sciences from Swarthmore College in 1960 and his M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1963 and 1966, respectively.\n\nVan Dam has mentored undergraduates, other scholars, and practitioners in hypertext and computer graphics. One of his students was Randy Pausch, who gained national renown in the process of dying from pancreatic cancer. Pausch's Last Lecture in September 2007 was the basis for the bestseller \"Last Lecture\". Van Dam was the final speaker after the hour-plus talk. He praised Pausch for his courage and leadership, calling him a role model. Pausch died on July 25, 2008. Danah Boyd, Scott Draves, Dick Bulterman, Andy Hertzfeld, and Steven K. Feiner also were students of Andy van Dam.\n\nOriginally appointed as a professor of applied mathematics, van Dam helped to found the computer science program at Brown as a joint project between the departments of applied mathematics and engineering. When the program was promoted to a full department, van Dam served as its first chair, from 1979 to 1985. In 1995 van Dam was appointed Thomas J. Watson, Jr. University Professor of Technology and Education as well as professor of computer science.\n\nAt the University of Pennsylvania in 1966, he became the second person to receive a Ph.D. in Computer Science.\n\nVan Dam is perhaps most known as the co-designer, along with Ted Nelson, of the first hypertext system, HES, in the late 1960s. With it and its immediate successor, FRESS, he was an early proponent of the use of hypertext in the humanities and in pedagogy. The term \"hypertext\" was coined by Ted Nelson, who was working with him at the time. Van Dam's continued interest in hypertext was crucial to the development of modern markup and browsing technology, and several of his students were instrumental in the origin of XML, XSLT, and related Web standards.\n\nHe is also known for co-authoring \"Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice\" with J.D. Foley, S.K. Feiner, and J.F. Hughes. This popular textbook in computer graphics and is often called the \"Bible\" of computer graphics.\n\nIn 1967, van Dam co-founded ACM SICGRAPH, the precursor of today's ACM SIGGRAPH.\n\nIn 1983 he was one of the founders of IRIS, which developed a hypertext scholar's workstation. In 1984, he received the IEEE Centennial Medal.\n\nVan Dam teaches an Introduction to Computer Graphics course, as well as one first-year course every fall. He is also serving on the technical board of Microsoft Research, as chairman of the Rhode Island Governor's Science and Technology Advisory Council (STAC), and as chairman of the IEEE James H. Mulligan, Jr. Education Medal committee. In 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, and a chaired professorship was recently endowed in his honor at Brown University.\n\nWhen the Brown Center for Information Technology was built, van Dam demanded it include showers and a Chinese restaurant. The showers were built.\n\nThe character of Andy in the film \"Toy Story\" is named after van Dam. The filmmakers, many of whom had van Dam as a professor, wanted to pay tribute to his pioneering work in computer graphics. This story is told during admissions tours at Brown University and has made it into the IMDB trivia for Toy Story. \"Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice\" appears on Andy's bookshelf in the film, which may be the origin of this rumor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117165", "title": "Motives for spying", "text": "Motives for spying\n\nThere are many motives for spying. Espionage usually carries heavy penalties, with spies often being regarded as traitors, so motivating factors for it must usually be quite strong.\n\nThere have been various attempts to explain why people become spies. One common theory is summed up by the acronym MICE: Money, Ideology, Compromise or Coercion (depending on source), and Ego or Extortion (depending on source). Another is the RASCLS framework: Reciprocation, Authority, Scarcity, Commitment and Consistency, Liking, and Social Proof. Others have stressed the roles of disaffection, grudges, and personal links.\n\nFor many spies, the primary motivation is the prospect of financial gain. Spies may seek to supplement their existing income, or to remedy financial difficulties. Sometimes these spies are detected due to extravagant spending of the money they receive. John Anthony Walker is an example of a spy who worked for money.\n\nSome people become spies because of their beliefs. These can include political opinions, national allegiances, and cultural or religious beliefs. This was particularly true during the Cold War, when many spies were motivated by their support for the ideologies of either the Western world or the Communist bloc. Examples of spies with ideological motivations include Kim Philby and Klaus Fuchs (communist), Fritz Kolbe and Juan Pujol (anti-Nazi), Nathan Hale (pro-American independence), Harriet Tubman (anti-slavery), and Ana Montes (pro-Cuban).\n\nNot all spies enter into service willingly; sometimes they are threatened into providing secret information.\n\nThreats of injury or death are the most direct forms of coercion. For example, Mathilde Carré, a member of the French Resistance, was captured by the Nazis and threatened with torture unless she became a double agent. Threats may also be made against the target's family or friends—Svetlana Tumanova was told by the KGB that her family in the Soviet Union would be harmed if she did not cooperate; and Ronald Humphrey said that he had helped North Vietnam in order to obtain the release of his Vietnamese wife.\n\nA more subtle form of coercion is blackmail, where someone threatens to release compromising information about a person unless they provide them with secret information. A wide range of material can be used for blackmail, including evidence of extramarital affairs, homosexuality, and undiscovered crimes. The spies John Vassall and Colonel Alfred Redl were threatened with revelations about their homosexuality. Sometimes, traps of this sort may be laid to collect blackmail material; Vassall was almost certainly set up, as was Clayton Lonetree, who was blackmailed after an affair with a Soviet agent. William Sebold, a German-born American, was threatened by the Nazis with revelations that he lied in order to immigrate. Sebold, however, quickly betrayed the Nazis, indicating a major problem with the use of coercion: The target, with no loyalty to their blackmailers, will turn on them when possible.\n\nThe roles of ego and pride in motivating spies has occasionally been observed, but is often hard to demonstrate. In some situations, a person can be enticed to spy by the sense of importance or significance it gives them—they cease being a minor functionary, and have a substantial, albeit covert, effect. The target often gains a sense of superiority over his or her colleagues, whom he or she is outwitting. Robert Hanssen is an example of someone who, though paid handsomely, decided to spy due to arrogance.\n\nIn rare cases a spy may be motivated by the excitement of tradecraft alone. It is possible, although hard to observe and demonstrate, that excitement and thrills play a part in some spies' decisions, and seems particularly likely if they are bored with their life. Excitement is seldom a spy's primary motivation, but may be a contributing factor. One notable example is Christopher Cooke, who claimed to be fascinated with espionage, and who told investigators he specifically sought to involve himself in spycraft for that reason.\n\nSome spies are motivated largely by personal, non-ideological hostility towards the country or organisation they are spying on. This may stem from some real or imagined wrong—a person may, for example, betray secrets to the enemy if they feel they have not received sufficient recognition or compensation, or that they have been treated badly. Liu Liankun, a general in the People's Republic of China, is believed to have begun spying for Taiwan after he was falsely accused of corruption and denied a promotion. Another case is that of Earl Edwin Pitts, who, in defence of his espionage, cited various instances of alleged poor treatment by his employer, the FBI.\n\nA spy may be motivated by personal connections and relationships. In some cases, secret information may be passed on due to a family connection, friendship, romantic link or sexual relationship. The spouses and friends of active spies may be drawn into the spy's activities; an example is Rosario Ames, wife of Aldrich Ames.\n\nSexual seduction is a well-established means of spy recruitment. For example, Katrina Leung was accused of using this method to gain access to secret FBI counterintelligence documents.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117169", "title": "Nonpareil, Guyana", "text": "Nonpareil, Guyana\n\nNonpareil (from the French and meaning matchless, inimitable) was the name of a sugarcane plantation, and later a village, on the east coast Demerara Region of Guyana that operated until the mid 20th century. Although the factory and village were torn down and disassembled in the 1940s, its population survived and formed the majority of the population of Enterprise, a modern village located one mile away from the site of old Nonpareil.\n\nIn 1838, the first group of East Indians arrived in Guyana as indentured servants to fill the huge employment gap created on the plantations after slavery was abolished four years previously. These new workers built their first homes in the area surrounding the plantations and from the small group that lived and worked at the Nonpareil Estate arose a village whose residents called it Nonpareil.\n\nLife in Nonpareil was poor though habitable and the community grew in time. New immigrants came and others paid their way back to India after meeting contractual obligations. By the end of the 19th century a small school and a hospital were erected, and other incentives like land ownership were offered to encourage workers to stay with the estate. The village flourished for the first few generations and life on the plantation included field work for everyone above the age of 11 at a decent wage. The children were offered a primary school education but most elected to work the fields, baling the sugarcane punts and clearing the canals.\n\nThis somewhat prosperous time did not last very long in the growing village. In fact, by 1910 living condition across the entire country were showing large signs of deterioration from lack of care and maintenance. After slavery - and the free labor that came with it - was abolished, sugar became less profitable across the West Indies and over a period of 20 years more than half of the country's factories closed, sold their machinery and their owners booked passage back to England.\n\nBy the 1940s, the handful of plantations still operating in the country were a consolidation of those that could not prosper alone. Even together, these small groups of estates still had trouble earning a substantial profit and the entire village bore the burden of economic slow down. Its people struggled to maintain their basic standards of living. This industrial down turn also brought poor wages to the already impoverished people. Before long the already degraded living conditions worsened and many villagers, especially the young, contracted diseases which in most cases took their lives - dysentery was the most widespread and the largest killer during this period.\n\nThe permeating squalid condition in Nonpareil continued throughout the 1940s and by the end of the decade daily protests in front the owner's yard were the norm. The villagers sought improvements to their poverty-stricken, slum-like surroundings but their complaints fell on deaf ears. The owners came to ignore the daily protest and elected instead to make minimal improvements which did nothing to change the poor conditions. The villagers, left without an option, resorted to their last but most effective tool: striking from the fields. Without the sugarcane from the fields the factories were unproductive, unprofitable and rendered useless. It did not take the owners very long to capitulate and striking became a useful weapon against the sometimes apathetic overseers then as it remains today against GuySuCo. In the end, the unyielding workers won larger, better drained and irrigated plots of land that were better suited to cultivating vegetation and building new homes at a new site.\n\nThe new site, which became Enterprise, was located one mile to the northeast and was not entirely unoccupied when people from Nonpareil migrated there, circa 1949. A small group of immigrants – according to most accounts 12-15 families – that were not employed by the estates had already built their first homes here. This group tended to their small farms cultivating fruits, ground provisions, plantains and vegetables. A few domesticated cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry also contributed to their daily living. The villagers fished in the many surrounding canals that yielded enough to feed the entire community according to some folklores. This practice of not working on the plantations but living off the land gained popularity among the new residents and many were happy to be rid of the under-paying, labour-intensive field work. Most, however, could not afford to leave the estate as they were highly in debt to it from private and personal loans. Living off the land alone for this group could not sustain their loan payments.\n\nToday, sugar is still the primary export of Guyana and most of the descendants of Nonpariel which makes up the population of Enterprise, are still employed by the sugar estates.\n\n"}

The station is owned by locally based McKinnon Broadcasting. KUSI's studios are located on Viewridge Avenue (near I-15) in the Kearny Mesa section of San Diego, and its transmitter is located southeast of Spring Valley. Its signal is relayed on low-powered K12PO in Murrieta. On cable, KUSI is available on Cox Communications, Charter Spectrum and AT&T U-verse channel 9.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on September 13, 1982. At its sign-on, it operated as a general entertainment independent station airing a mix of children's programs, sitcoms, older theatrical and made-for-TV movies, drama series and sports events. The station's license was originally assigned to United States International University (now Alliant International University; the school's former initials served as the basis of the station's callsign); however, prior to the station's sign-on, USIU sold the license to Texas businessman Michael D. McKinnon. His company, McKinnon Broadcasting (which operates the station under the wholly owned licensee Channel 51 of San Diego, Inc.), is owned by Mike McKinnon (who has a controlling 66.26% stake), brother C. Dan McKinnon (who has a 17.48% stake) and sons Michael Dean McKinnon and Mark Daniel McKinnon (who hold 08.13% each)). Channel 51 of San Diego, Inc., is a California-based licensee corporation, while Corpus Christi-based corporation San Diego's Fifty-One, Inc., is a holding company for McKinnon Broadcasting.\n\nIn January 1994, the station dropped its weekday morning children's programs, moving them to afternoons upon the launch of a morning newscast; by 1995, KUSI began dropping many of these shows (which were scattered among other local outlets) and added more court, talk and reality shows, mirroring the scheduling format used by Los Angeles independent station KCAL-TV during that time period. The cartoons and recent off-network sitcoms were moved to a weaker station, KTTY (channel 69, now Fox affiliate KSWB-TV), which became a charter affiliate of The WB in January 1995. On January 16 of that year, KUSI gained a network affiliation when it became San Diego's original outlet of the upstart United Paramount Network (UPN).\n\nEleven months later in November 1995, in an attempt to take the Fox affiliation away from Tijuana-licensed XETV (channel 6), KUSI filed an appeal against the Federal Communications Commission's decision to grant Fox a permit to broadcast live sports on the Mexican-licensed signal of XETV (McKinnon Broadcasting had made an earlier unsuccessful attempt to pull the Fox affiliation from XETV in April 1991). Fox had picked up the broadcast rights to NFL games from the National Football Conference the year prior, as cited in the United States Court of Appeals case \"Channel 51 of San Diego, Inc. vs. FCC and Fox Television Stations, Inc.\" 79 F.3d 1187. FCC regulations disallowed television stations that were licensed outside the United States from airing live sporting events from a U.S. broadcast network without licensing approval.\n\nThe permit was granted to Fox on behalf of XETV, and the case was settled on March 26, 1996. However, until XETV started its own news department in December 1999, KUSI provided newsgathering resources to Fox's news and sports divisions for the San Diego market (similarly, in 2008, it was rumored that KUSI would affiliate with The CW after KSWB-TV decided to end its affiliation with that network after two years in order to assume the Fox affiliation from XETV on August 1 of that year, but The CW chose to affiliate with XETV instead). KUSI dropped UPN when its affiliation agreement with the network expired on January 16, 1998, citing low ratings for the network's programming locally. UPN programming remained available in the market on local cable providers via the network's Los Angeles owned-and-operated station KCOP-TV (whose presence in the market also played a factor in KUSI dropping the UPN affiliation); however, many San Diegans that did not have a cable television subscription or a strong antenna (facing Los Angeles) were unable to view UPN programs within the market until Tecate, Baja California-licensed XHUPN (channel 49, later MyNetworkTV affiliate XHDTV-TDT) signed on in November 1999.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, KUSI announced plans to open a new state-of-the-art streetside studio facility in downtown San Diego. However, the site that was intended to house its new studio facilities was eventually sold to Bosa Development; KUSI continues to operate from its Kearny Mesa studios. Since McKinnon Broadcasting sold its two Texas stations, KBMT in Beaumont and KIII in Corpus Christi, to the London Broadcasting Company respectively in August 5, 2009 and August 31, 2010 (since sold to Tegna, which also purchased KUSI rival KFMB-TV (channel 8) in 2018), KUSI is currently the company's only remaining television station property as of August 2014.\n\nKUSI-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 51, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 18. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 51.\n\nSyndicated programming on KUSI-TV includes \"The People's Court\", \"The Big Bang Theory\", \"The Real\", \"TMZ on TV\", \"Extra\" and \"Family Feud\", among others. From 1987 to 1994 and again from 1997 to 2003, KUSI held the over-the-air television rights to San Diego Padres Major League Baseball games; during the second tenure, the station had only broadcast the team's Sunday games, which were produced by 4SD until becoming exclusive to the cable channel in 2004.\n\nKUSI-TV presently broadcasts 62½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week.\n\nKUSI became active in the local television news race when it launched its news department with the introduction of an hour-long 10:00 p.m. newscast in September 1990. Originally anchored by veteran television anchors Roger Grimsby and George Reading, it was the first television station in San Diego to begin producing local newscasts since XETV's original news department folded in 1972, after it lost the ABC affiliation to KCST (channel 39, now NBC owned-and-operated station KNSD). On January 5, 1994, the station debuted a three-hour weekday morning newscast from 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. Originally anchored by Laura Buxton and Tom Blair (who was later replaced by Stan Miller), it gradually became a competitor to the national morning newscasts aired during the final two hours of the program.\n\nThe station is known for its series of civic and consumer watchdog reports during its evening newscasts called \"The Turko Files\", helmed by investigative reporter Michael Turko (who regularly utters the line \"It Ain't Right\" during the segments). From 1994 to 2014, John Coleman (a longtime Chicago weatherman and co-founder of The Weather Channel) served as KUSI's chief meteorologist, appearing on its evening newscasts. During his tenure at the station, Coleman was known for his trademark drawn-out pronunciation of the station's call letters (\"K-uuuuuuuuuuu-S-I\"), and providing his own lively presentation during the forecast segments (often referring to the strong winds that affect the area as the \"SOSA\" (or \"Sort of Santa Ana\"), and breaking out in dance at random). Coleman retired from broadcasting in April 2014 after a 61-year career; however, he did not appear on-air for a proper sendoff (as he was on vacation at the time) when KUSI ran a retrospective of his career on the April 10 edition of the 6:00 p.m. newscast.\n\nIn January 2000, KUSI expanded its news programming into early evenings with the debut of a half-hour newscast at 7:00 p.m.; within a few months, however, the program was moved to 6:30 p.m. Subsequently, in July 2001, an additional half-hour newscast at 6:00 p.m. was launched. In January 2005, the station expanded its late evening news programming with the debut of a half-hour 11:00 p.m. newscast. On April 1, 2010, beginning with the station's 6:00 p.m. newscast, KUSI became the fourth television station in the San Diego market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. In 2011, the station began using the AFD #10 broadcast flag to present its newscasts in letterboxed widescreen for viewers watching on cable television through television sets.\n\nIn September 2011, the station expanded its weekday morning newscast to five hours, with the addition of an hour at 9:00 a.m. (replacing \"Live with Regis and Kelly\", which moved to CBS affiliate KFMB-TV on that date). On August 11, 2014, KUSI debuted an hour-long 5:00 p.m. newscast; subsequently on August 16, the station expanded its weekend morning newscasts to five hours, with the addition of an hour at 10:00 a.m.\n\nKUSI's newscast drew criticism in December 2019 for an interview with Congressman Duncan D. Hunter in which the only questions asked were those suggested by his staff.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117185", "title": "KSWB-TV", "text": "KSWB-TV\n\nKSWB-TV, virtual channel 69 (UHF digital channel 26), is a Fox-affiliated television station licensed to San Diego, California, United States. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group. KSWB's studios are located on Engineer Road in the city's Kearny Mesa section (within a quarter-mile to the west of the studios of CBS affiliate KFMB-TV, channel 8), and its transmitter is located southeast of Spring Valley.\n\nKSWB-TV is branded as Fox 5 San Diego, in reference to its primary cable channel position in the market on most local cable providers (it is also carried in Baja California, Mexico on Izzi channel 92). Until 2011, the logo bug shown during the station's newscasts rotated between its common cable channel position and its over-the-air virtual channel number, 69.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on October 1, 1984 as KTTY. The station originally operated from studios located on Frontage Road in Chula Vista. Originally locally owned by San Diego Television, it operated as an independent station; it maintained a general entertainment format featuring a mix of dramas, classic movies, cartoons and religious programming that the other stations in the market declined to air. KTTY also aired a significant amount of paid programming. The station suffered from low ratings throughout its run as an independent station, struggling to compete with established independents XETV-TV (channel 6) and KUSI-TV (channel 51). On January 11, 1995, KTTY became the San Diego charter affiliate of The WB, an upstart broadcast network that was majority owned by the Warner Bros. Entertainment division of Time Warner.\n\nThe station fell into bankruptcy, and Tribune Broadcasting, whose corporate parent—the Tribune Company—owned the remaining stake in The WB that Time Warner did not maintain, purchased the station at a bankruptcy auction in 1995, and took control of it in 1996; on August 16 of that year, the company changed the station's call letters to KSWB-TV (for \"San Diego's WB,\" which served as the station's slogan for most of its tenure with The WB). After Tribune took ownership of channel 69, the station added many off-network sitcoms to its schedule, with talk and court shows being mixed in as well throughout the remainder of the 1990s.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down the broadcast networks that they had respectively owned, The WB and UPN. In their place, the companies would combine The WB and UPN's respective programming to create a new \"fifth\" network called The CW (a name that represents the first initials of each of the network's corporate parents), which would also include newer series developed for the network. With the announcement, The CW signed a ten-year affiliation agreement with Tribune Broadcasting for 16 of the group's 19 WB affiliates, with KSWB-TV named as the network's San Diego affiliate.\n\nThe CW officially launched on September 18, 2006 (Entravision-owned UPN affiliate XHUPN-TV in nearby Tecate, Baja California, Mexico joined MyNetworkTV, another startup network run by Fox Entertainment Group that launched two weeks prior to The CW's debut, and changed its callsign to XHDTV-TV). Unlike many other former WB affiliates that also had call letters relating to its former affiliation, KSWB chose to retain the callsign that references the now-defunct network. The station also served as the local broadcaster of games from the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers until it switched to Fox, which were produced by Los Angeles sister station KTLA (KTLA itself would lose the broadcast rights to the Clippers to regional sports networks Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket in 2009).\n\nDuring a seminar by Sam Zell on March 25, 2008, it was revealed that Tribune Broadcasting (which Zell acquired as part of his 2007 takeover of the Tribune Company, which would result in the start of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings that lasted four years until 2012 due to debt from Zell's leveraged buyout) had signed an affiliation agreement with Fox to make KSWB the network's new San Diego affiliate. This caught station management at Tijuana-licensed XETV-TV off guard as there was no knowledge about the impending loss of its Fox affiliation until the announcement was made public (that station's status as a Fox affiliate was contested unsuccessfully in a previous attempt by KUSI-TV to strip the affiliation from XETV in a 1995 U.S. Court of Appeals filing). Fox later cited concerns with having its programming airing on a Mexican-licensed station (which happened six years earlier when XETV's sister stations in Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo were stripped of their affiliations), even though XETV had broadcast its programming almost entirely in English for over half a century and was Fox's charter affiliate in the market since the network's October 1986 inception. \n\nAt first, there was speculation that CW network programming in the San Diego market would be brought in out-of-market from KSWB's Los Angeles sister station KTLA, which was carried on cable locally at the time on Cox Communications channel 14. Two other scenarios were also being entertained, including speculation that KUSI-TV would pick up the CW affiliation or that KSWB would re-activate its second digital subchannel (which had been silent since The Tube Music Network abruptly ceased operations in October 2007) and move the network's programming there. On July 2, 2008, Bay City Television/Grupo Televisa signed an affiliation agreement to bring The CW's programming over to XETV. With the Fox affiliation agreement, KSWB-TV's ten-year contract with The CW was rendered void, ending the station's two-year association with the network as it joined Fox on August 1, 2008, directly swapping affiliations with XETV-TV as the CW affiliation for the market was moved over to that station. In turn, XETV replaced KSWB as the default CW affiliate for DirecTV subscribers in the few areas of the western United States where a CW-affiliated station is not receivable over-the-air or through cable television.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group announced that it would acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. Had the deal received regulatory approval, the proposed sale would have put KSWB-TV (and sister stations KTLA in Los Angeles and KTXL-TV in Sacramento) under common ownership with Sinclair's two existing California-based duopolies: CBS affiliate KBAK-TV and Fox affiliate KBFX-CD in Bakersfield, and Fox affiliate KMPH-TV and CW affiliate KFRE-TV in Fresno, California, plus pending acquisitions (from a separate deal) KRCR-TV and KAEF-TV in Redding and Eureka, respectively.\n\nOn December 15, 2017, it was speculated that Sinclair would resell KSWB-TV to Fox Television Stations upon approval of the Tribune deal. On April 24, 2018, Sinclair announced that KSWB-TV would be one of 23 stations sold to obtain approval for the merger, though it was one of seven stations for which a buyer was not disclosed. On May 9, 2018, it was officially announced that Fox Television Stations would buy KSWB-TV, as part of a $910-million deal that also involved six other Tribune-owned stations (Fox affiliates KTXL, KCPQ/Seattle, KDVR/Denver, WJW/Cleveland and KSTU/Salt Lake City, and CW affiliate WSFL-TV/Miami). If the sale is approved, it would make KSWB-TV (and sister station KTXL) a Fox owned-and-operated station and sister to KTVU in Oakland/San Francisco and KTTV in Los Angeles. It would also be the third O&O station in San Diego (behind NBC O&O KNSD and Telemundo O&O KUAN-LD).\n\nThree weeks after the FCC's July 18 vote to have the deal reviewed by an administrative law judge amid \"serious concerns\" about Sinclair's forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties, on August 9, 2018, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal, intending to seek other M&A opportunities. Tribune also filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that Sinclair engaged in protracted negotiations with the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division over regulatory issues, refused to sell stations in markets where it already had properties, and proposed divestitures to parties with ties to Sinclair executive chair David D. Smith that were rejected or highly subject to rejection to maintain control over stations it was required to sell. The termination of the Sinclair sale agreement places uncertainty for the future of Fox's purchases of KSWB and the other six Tribune stations included in that deal, which were predicated on the closure of the Sinclair–Tribune merger.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Irving, Texas-based Nexstar Media Group announced it would acquire the assets of Tribune Media for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. In the case of KSWB, reports preceding the purchase announcement stated that, as it did during the group's failed purchase by Sinclair, Fox Television Stations would seek to acquire certain Fox-affiliated stations owned by Tribune from the eventual buyer of that group. The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16 and was completed on September 19, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nUpon receiving the Fox affiliation, KSWB surpassed Syracuse, New York affiliate WSYT (which broadcast on UHF channel 68) as the highest channel allocation of any Fox station in the country (and was tied with Atlanta owned-and-operated station WUPA for the highest channel number of any CW affiliate during KSWB's two-year tenure with that network). Since the digital transition, it retains the highest PSIP channel number out of Fox's stations.\n\nOn October 1, 2010, the station began to carry This TV on its second digital subchannel, the first time since a short-lived affiliation with The Tube Music Network prior to that service ending operations in October 2007 that KSWB had carried a digital subchannel. The station then added the Tribune-owned classic television service Antenna TV to a new 69.3 subchannel upon that network's January 1, 2011 debut. It moved to KSWB-DT2 on November 1, 2019 upon the launch of Court TV under a deal with Tribune on all their stations made before the Nexstar merger went into effect, with This TV being removed upon that date.\n\nKSWB shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 69, on February 17, 2009, the original target date in which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back five months to June 12, 2009). The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 19. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 69, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.\n\nOutside of the Fox network schedule, syndicated programming broadcast by KSWB-TV includes \"Rachael Ray\", \"Two and a Half Men\", \"Family Guy\", \"Daily Mail TV\", \"Modern Family\", and \"Jerry Springer\".\n\nKSWB-TV presently broadcasts 59¾ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 11¼ hours each weekday and 1¾ hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in addition, the station produces the 15-minute sports highlight program \"Fox 5 Sports Final\", which airs every night at 10:45 p.m.\n\nAs a WB affiliate, KSWB launched its first news department on September 27, 1999 with the debut of a half-hour 10:00 p.m. newscast (called \"WB News at Ten\"); the news operation was formed as a result of a corporate request by Tribune for its WB-affiliated stations that did not already have news departments to begin producing their own local newscasts. This program was designed to compete against an established hour-long prime time newscast on KUSI and gained a competitor in XETV-TV's upstart news department when it launched its own newscast at 10:00 p.m. that December. On March 7, 2005, the station debuted \"The WB Morning Show\", a simulcast of Los Angeles sister station KTLA's weekday morning newscast interspersed with half-hourly local news inserts presented by a solo anchor from KSWB's San Diego studios.\n\nOn September 22, 2005, KSWB announced that its news department would be shut down, laying off 29 of the department's 30 staffers (with the exception of Jeff Powers, who continued to anchor the 10:00 p.m. newscast until he left the station). The final 10:00 p.m. newscast produced by KSWB aired on October 28, 2005. Production of the prime time newscast was turned over to NBC station KNSD (channel 39) through a news share agreement on October 31. The broadcast retained the \"WB News at Ten\" title and the 615 Music-composed music package \"Firepower News\" (which was originally commissioned by KSWB for its in-house newscasts), but now originated from KNSD's then-facility at 225 Broadway in downtown San Diego (local cut-ins during \"The WB Morning Show\" continued to originate from KSWB's Kearny Mesa studios). The agreement between KNSD and KSWB was similar to outsourced newscasts on other Tribune stations such as WPHL-TV in Philadelphia (whose 10:00 p.m. newscast became produced by WCAU following the 2005 shutdown of WPHL's news department, before production was turned over to WPVI-TV in 2012) and KRCW-TV in Portland (whose 10:00 p.m. newscast was produced by KGW from 2005 to 2019 when production was transferred to Nexstar sister station KOIN).\nTo correspond with KSWB's affiliation change to The CW, the KTLA morning news simulcast and the KNSD-produced 10:00 p.m. news were accordingly renamed as \"The CW Morning Show\" and \"CW News at Ten\" on September 18, 2006. KNSD reporter Anne State assumed co-anchoring duties until April 2008, when she left for Chicago CBS owned-and-operated station WBBM-TV. Vic Salazar then solo anchored the 10:00 p.m. broadcast for the final months of KNSD's production of the program, until he left that station. In addition, the station also produced a public affairs show called \"Take 5\", that aired Sunday evenings at 10:30 p.m.\n\nAfter the announcement that KSWB would become San Diego's new Fox affiliate, the station reassumed production responsibilities for its newscasts, with the KTLA simulcast and KNSD-produced 10:00 p.m. news airing for the last time on July 31, 2008. The second incarnation of the news department launched upon the August 1 affiliation switch with the debuts of a new weekday morning news program (initially airing from 5:00 to 9:00 a.m.) and a now hour-long 10:00 p.m. newscast, which have both been produced in high definition since the return of in-house news operations. The station also began using a logo and graphics package by Hothaus Creative based on the standardized look of Fox's owned-and-operated stations (variants of the KSWB graphics were adapted for use by other Fox affiliates owned by Tribune and some previously owned by Newport Television).\n\nOn September 14, 2009, KSWB debuted an hour-long 6:00 p.m. newscast that competes against local newscasts on KUSI-TV (an hour-long program), KNSD and KGTV (channel 10) (both a half-hour at 6:00 p.m.), KFMB-TV (channel 8) (at 6:30) and evening network newscasts on the latter three stations. This was part of a companywide expansion of early evening and in some cases, midday newscasts on Tribune's Fox affiliates (KCPQ in Seattle was the last of the company's seven Fox stations to expand its news programming with the June 2011 debut of a 5:00 p.m. newscast). This was followed two years later on September 26, 2011 by the launch of an hour-long 5:00 p.m. newscast on weeknights; that broadcast was quietly expanded to weekend evenings in May 2014. On September 8, 2014, KSWB debuted two one-hour newscasts at 1:00 and 4:00 p.m. on weekday afternoons.\n\nKSWB-TV is described as a CNN affiliate by the cable news network. Both news operations conduct live shots, air packages, publish stories online, and more with each other. CNN has an \"author\" page on KSWB-TV's website.\n\nThe station has many elements to it that reflect Southern Californian culture. They frequently feature celebrities as guests on their morning news program, many of them San Diego natives. Past guests include The Black Eyed Peas, Bobby Lee, who starred in Mad TV which used to air on the station via the Fox network, and YouTube star brothers Brian, and Brandon Awadis. During the morning broadcast, some weather segments are branded as the \"Surf Report\". Some female KSWB-TV on-air personalities have been featured in annual \"Hottest News Chick\" contests. The morning show also features a recurring live interview segment with KTLA entertainment reporter Sam Rubin. The top \"water cooler talk\" entertainment stories of the morning is the topic of discussion.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117192", "title": "Copa Interamericana", "text": "Copa Interamericana\n\nThe Copa Interamericana () was an annual club football competition organized by the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) and Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol (CONMEBOL) since 1969. It was discontinued in 1998 after CONCACAF clubs, particularly those from Mexico, began participating in CONMEBOL competitions. The Interamerican Cup was founded as a result of the refusal from CONMEBOL and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) of allowing CONCACAF clubs, as well as those from other confederations, to participate in the European/South American Cup, later known as the \"Toyota Cup\" and informally called the \"Intercontinental Cup\".\n\nThe competition was supposed to be contested between the winners of the North American CONCACAF Champions Cup and the South American Copa Libertadores tournaments although the participants have varied at times. The format of the competition was extremely sporadic. From its formation, the competition was usually contested over a two legged tie, with a playoff if necessary until 1968, and penalty kicks later. However, it was common for several consecutive editions to go undisputed. Of the 18 competitions played, four of them were disputed over several matches in just one venue. Two others were held in a single match. Another two editions had participants that had not qualified outright to dispute the competition. Most of the editions were disputed one, and sometimes two, years after the participants had qualified to dispute it. This was the result of the lack of financial incentives and the low relevance of the competition usually view with little appeal from the South American teams (unlike the Intercontinental Cup, which was considered a club world cup until 2004).\nThe 18 Interamerican Cup tournaments were won by 13 club teams. Argentine side Independiente won a record three titles. The last winner of the cup was American side D.C. United, defeating Brazilian side Vasco da Gama 2-1 on aggregate in 1998. Argentina was the most successful national league with seven titles, while Uruguayan outfit Nacional and Independiente share the record for the most appearances with three each.\n\nIn 1969, an agreement came between the confederations of South America (CONMEBOL) and Central and North America (CONCACAF) to dispute an annual competition, the Interamerican Cup, which pitted the champions of those two confederations in a format similar to the Intercontinental Cup. The first edition was disputed between Estudiantes and Mexican club Toluca in which each team won 2-1 in their away legs. The playoff in Montevideo proved to be the tie-breaker as Estudiantes won a violent match 2-0. This promising start did little to help the competition; due to the difference in interests between the clubs involved, the Interamerican Cup had an even more sporadic lifeline than the more prestigious Intercontinental Cup; sometimes, years would go without it being played. The second edition was played four years later, in 1971, which saw Nacional edge Mexican side Cruz Azul 3-2 on aggregate. Independiente would become the only club to win the competition three times in a row, from 1972 to 1974, after seeing off Honduran club Olimpia, Guatemalan club Municipal and Mexican side Atlético Español, the last two after a penalty shoot-out. Mexico's América broke the South American hegemony after beating Boca Juniors in a play-off match in 1977. As a result of this victory, the Mexican squad argued that it had the right to participate in the Intercontinental Cup of that year; however, they were denied the opportunity. Paraguay's Olimpia returned the trophy back south in 1980 with a victory over El Salvador's FAS but Club Universidad Nacional of Mexico City defeating Uruguay's Nacional to win CONCACAF's second title.\n\nThe competition entered a state of hiatus again, this time for five years. In 1986, Argentinos Juniors would defeat Defence Force of Trinidad and Tobago in a single-match final. River Plate would keep the trophy in Argentina, for the second year running, defeating Costa Rican side Alajuelense. Uruguay's Nacional would trounce Honduras' Olimpia 5-1 on aggregate the following year. Colombia's Atlético Nacional made short work of Club Universidad Nacional; however, South America hegemony would once again be broken by América after defeating Paraguay's Olimpia. Compatriots Puebla failed to retain the trophy in Mexico after being routed by Chile's Colo-Colo. The importance of the competition decreased significantly after two Brazilian clubs, Copa Libertadores winners São Paulo (1993) and Grêmio (1995) declined to participate out of disinterest; both times, the Copa Libertadores runners-up, Chilean side Universidad Católica and Atlético Nacional took their place; each of them were pushed to the limit by Costa Rica's Saprissa. Vélez Sársfield beat Costa Rican club Cartaginés in 1994 while the last Interamerican Cup, held in 1998, saw American club D.C. United beat Vasco da Gama. \n\nThe Interamerican Cup was abolished in 1998 when Mexican clubs began to participate in the Copa Libertadores and other CONCACAF teams participated in the Copa Sudamericana. Since 2000, when FIFA adopted the Club World Championship format clash between the champions of all continental confederations, the champions of CONCACAF and CONMEBOL again have the opportunity to meet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117193", "title": "United Voice", "text": "United Voice\n\nUnited Voice was a large Australian trade union, with over 130,000 members. United Voice members worked in a wide range of occupations including hospitality, childcare, teachers' aides, aged care, property services (cleaning, security, maintenance etc.), health, manufacturing, ambulance workers (in some states) and community services. \n\nThe union was established in 1992 as the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union (LHMU) (the \"Missos\") following the amalgamation of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia (FMWU) and Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees' Union of Australia (LTU). It was renamed United Voice from 1 March 2011. \n\nUnited Voice is one of the most powerful unions in the Labor Left faction of the Australian Labor Party.\n\nIn 2018, the union began plans to merge with the National Union of Workers. In June 2019, the Fair Work Commission approved a vote on the proposed merger between the two unions which will be held in August.. On 30 August 2019 the Australian Electoral Commission declared the result of the vote, with just over 95% of members supporting the amalgamation. The name of the new union is the United Workers Union. On 11 November 2019, the new United Workers Union was formed.\n\nUnited Voice was first established in 1910 as the Watchmen, Caretakers and Cleaners Union of New South Wales (W.C.C.U.), which was created by the Organising Committee of the New South Wales Labor Council. The task of organisation was a difficult one, due to the casualised and isolated nature of the occupations covered. Under the leadership of the first Secretary of the WCCU, Joe Coote, the union adopted a pragmatic approach to increasing union membership, by including any workers not already represented by trade unions, such as paintmaking employees. To reflect the growing range of industries represented, on 15 December 1915 the union amalgamated with the Victorian Branch and changed its name to the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union.\n\nAfter steady growth over the first half of the century, including winning paid sick leave, annual leave and a forty-hour week, the union really took off in the 1950s. A new rank-and-file leadership led by Ray Gietzelt took over to create a vibrant, member-driven union. Famous campaigns during the 1950s and 1960s included organising workers paid to be Santa Clauses at Christmas and a group of dance instructors who were locked out for four months before winning their jobs back.\n\nThe strength of the \"Missos\" continued to grow over the years, with membership increasing from 25,000 in 1955 to 88,000 by 1975.\n\nBy the late 1980s, the LHMU had gained a good deal of political power. It benefited from the close links of Ray Gietzelt to ALP politicians such as Bob Hawke, Neville Wran, Lionel Murphy and his brother Arthur Gietzelt. Subsequently, though, its fortunes declined. The move of flight catering and aircraft cleaning staff to join the Transport Workers Union in the mid-1990s resulted in the LHMU losing several thousand members. In 1996 John Howard became Prime Minister, and his government worked to weaken the union movement as a whole, with the result that the LHMU lost further members between 1996 and 2007.\n\nSince Howard's defeat in 2007, nevertheless, the union has reported a small but steady growth in numbers, even as the membership of most other Australian unions has continued to shrink. Its major campaign on cleaners' behalf, called \"Clean Start:Fair Deal for Cleaners\", was inspired by the successful American campaign called Justice for Janitors.\n\nThe strong links with prominent ALP figures continued. Former cabinet ministers Penny Wong and Mark Butler were both LHMU branch officials in South Australia before they entered the federal parliament.\n\nUnited Voice was a federation of state and territory branches. Each branch contributes financially to the national office.\n\nThe National Council was the highest decision making body in the union. It was made up of delegates from each Branch of the union, and each section within those Branches. Half of National Council's membership was rank and file members. National Council met in August each year. The Executive carries out the decisions of the Council.\n\nThe National Executive is the national management committee of United Voice. National Executive met at least twice per year, but usually around four times. Members of National executive are elected to their positions, and there are rules for proper representation of membership sections and gender. The National Secretary are elected officers of the Union who work as the chief executives and operational managers of the National Union. The National presidents are also elected officers whose role is to chair the Council and Executive meetings.\n\nJo-Anne Schofield is the National Secretary of United Voice.\n\nEach state and territory has its own branch of the union, with roughly the same structure as the national office. Each branch has a Branch Council and a Branch Executive.\n\nIn Australia, United Voice was affiliated with the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It was also a member of various other not-for-profit organisations such as the Sydney Alliance and SmokeFree Australia.\n\nInternationally, the union was affiliated with the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Association.\n\n\"Big Steps\" is a national campaign to increase the wages of child care workers also known as early childhood education and care (ECEC). United Voice called on the federal government to give childcare centres 1.4 billion in extra funding to increase staff wages without increasing fees for parents. They want the average wage to increase from $18.58 an hour to $26.\n\n\"Clean Start: Fair Deal for Cleaners\" was launched by United Voice in 2006, to highlight the problems in the CBD office cleaning industry and improve jobs for cleaners. The focus of the campaign was on fair and safe workloads, respect and fair treatment at work, job security, and higher wages.\n\nIn September 2011, United Voice joined with many other unions to campaign for marriage equality for same-sex couples. The \"Unions for Marriage Equality\" campaign was timed to start a few months before the Labor National Conference in December 2011.\n\nUnited Voice serves on the steering committee for the Responsible Gambling Awareness Week, an annual event that focuses on the promotion of responsible gambling and services that assist people with problem gambling issues throughout Australia.\n\nIn August 2016, ABC's 7:30 Report \"Former United Voice workers accuse the union of hypocrisy\" was produced. The Report detailed allegations of mismanagement and bullying Journalist Pat McGrath reported that he had spoken to 15 past and current staff members who alleged that bullying was \"rife\" in the union, that organisers were put under pressure to reach unattainable targets, and 'counselled out' when they didn't, and that working at the union had taken a mental and physical toll on staff. One staff member claimed he had been stood down after his attempts to negotiate pay and conditions for workers within the union. The union responded that he was stood down due to aggressive behaviour. He was seen reading the book \"Spirit Level\" on the program, and excerpts of his email asking National Secretary Jo Schofield were screened, showing that he had \"respectfully asked\" for the creation of a group to represent workers within the union. One staff member was quoted in the program as suffering from physical and mental distress leading to issues such as depression and psoriasis due to the \"style of management.\" They reported that their manager was so strongly supported by senior management that taking any internal action would have led to further anxiety, and they had left the union.\n\nIn the three years previous to the program, one claim of bullying and one of unfair dismissal were settled by the union. Union money was used to pay for the settlements.\n\nThe union denied the allegations of the 7:30 Report and noted that it did have an agreement with staff. It did not make the agreement, which is not a public document, available to the 7:30 Report. According to the same ABC article referenced above, the union further denied that the organisation had a culture of bullying and additionally denied claims that it refused to negotiate employment conditions with its staff.\n\n"}
{"id": "2117203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117203", "title": "Division of Richmond", "text": "Division of Richmond\n\nThe Division of Richmond is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.\n\nThe division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. The division is named after the area in which it is located, namely the Richmond Valley and Richmond River, which was named in honour of Charles, the fifth Duke of Richmond.\n\nHistorically, the division has been a rural seat and fairly safe for the National Party (formerly called the Country Party), which held it for all but six years from 1922 to 2004. For 55 of those years, it was held by three generations of the Anthony family—Hubert Lawrence Anthony (a minister in the Fadden and Menzies governments), Doug Anthony (leader of the National Party from 1971 to 1984 and Deputy Prime Minister in the Gorton, McMahon and Fraser governments) and Larry Anthony (a minister in the Howard government)—the first three-generation dynasty in the Australian House of Representatives. However, it became far less safe for the Nationals from 1983 onward, and strong population growth over the last three decades has seen it progressively lose its rural territory and reduced it to a more coastal-based and urbanised division. Accompanying demographic change has made the seat friendlier to Labor since the 1990s.\n\nThe division's most notable member outside of the Anthony family was Charles Blunt, leader of the National Party from 1989 to 1990. His tenure was short-lived, however. Just months after becoming leader of the Nationals, he was defeated in the 1990 election when the preferences of anti-nuclear activist Helen Caldicott allowed Neville Newell to claim the seat for Labor for the first time ever, despite only winning 27 percent of first preferences. It was only the second time that a major party leader had lost his own seat in an election. Larry Anthony (junior) regained the seat for the Nationals in 1996, only to be defeated by Labor's Justine Elliot in 2004—the first time a member of the Anthony family had been unseated in an election. In 2007, Elliot picked up a large swing as Labor won government, technically making Richmond a safe Labor seat. She retained the seat at the 2010, 2013 and 2016 elections. The victory in 2013 came even as Labor lost government, marking the second time (her 2004 victory being the first) that the non-Labor parties have been in government without holding Richmond.\n\nRichmond had the sixth highest vote for the Australian Greens, and saw the highest rural seat vote for the Greens in the nation. A redistribution ahead of the 2016 election pushed the seat to the south, into the area around Ballina. Much of this area is in the state seat of Ballina, which was taken by the Greens at the 2015 state election.\n\nThe division is located in the far north-east of the state, adjacent to the Coral Sea. It adjoins the Queensland border to the north, and encompasses the towns of Ballina, Tweed Heads, Murwillumbah and Byron Bay.\n\n"}

Its work supports free market economic policy framed within Judeo-Christian morality. It has been alternately described as conservative and libertarian. Acton Institute also organizes seminars \"to educate religious leaders of all denominations, business executives, entrepreneurs, university professors, and academic researchers in economics principles.\"\n\nThe Acton Institute was founded in 1990 in Grand Rapids, Michigan by Robert A. Sirico and Kris Alan Mauren. It is named after the English historian, politician and writer Lord Acton, who is popularly associated with the dictum \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\". Sirico and Mauren were concerned that many religious people were ignorant of economic realities, and that many economists and businessmen were insufficiently grounded in religious principles. Sirico explains the essential link between economics and religion with reference to the institute's namesake:\n\nThe release in 1991 of the papal encyclical \"Centesimus annus\" buoyed the institute at a critical time. The document provided, a year after Acton's founding, established support for the institute's economic personalism and defense of capitalism. Robert Sirico said at the time that it constituted a \"vindication\".\n\nIn 2002, the Institute opened a Rome office, Istituto Acton, to carry out Acton's mission abroad. In 2004, the Institute was given the Templeton Freedom Award for its \"extensive body of work on the moral defense of the free market\". In 2012, the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program at the University of Pennsylvania included Acton in its list of the top 50 think tanks in the United States.\n\nIn 2005, \"Mother Jones\" published a chart which included the Acton Institute on a list of groups that had reportedly received a donation ($155,000) from ExxonMobil. As of 2007, the Institute had received funding from the Earhart Foundation and the Bradley Foundation. The \"Grand Rapids Press\" wrote in 2013 that much of the Acton Institute's funding comes from residents of western Michigan, including John Kennedy, president and CEO of Autocam Corp., and Amway co-founder Richard DeVos.\n\nThe Acton Institute is a member of the State Policy Network, a network of free-market oriented think tanks in the United States.\n\nThe Acton Institute has built a network of international affiliations including Centro Interdisciplinar de Ética e Economia Personalista, Brazil, Europa Institut, Austria, Institute for the Study of Human Dignity and Economic Freedom, Zambia and Instituto Acton Argentina Organization.\n\nFrom its guiding principles and economic research, the institute publishes books, papers, and periodicals, and maintains a media outreach effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilms produced by the Acton Institute include \"The Call of the Entrepreneur\" (2007) and \"Poverty, Inc.\" (2014), which won a 2014 Templeton Freedom Award from the Atlas Network. \"Poverty Inc.\" is part of the Acton Institute's PovertyCure initiative, which seeks to create solutions to poverty by \"moving efforts from aid to enterprise and from paternalism to partnerships.\"\n\nBesides Sirico, notable scholars associated with the institute include Anthony Bradley, Jordan Ballor, Stephen Grabill, Michael Matheson Miller, Marvin Olasky, Kevin Schmiesing, and Jonathan Witt. The institute's director of research is Samuel Gregg, author of the prize-winning book \"The Commercial Society.\" Andreas Widmer is a research fellow in entrepreneurship for the research department.\n\nCurrent and former members of the institute's board of directors include Alejandro Chafuen, former president of the Atlas Network; Gaylen Byker, president emeritus of Calvin College; Sean Fieler, Equinox Partners; Leslie Graves, president of the Lucy Burns Institute; Frank Hanna III of Hanna Capital; and Robert Sirico, president of the Acton Institute.\n\n"}

This attraction opened in 1967 with the new Tomorrowland and closed in 1997 for the 1998 New Tomorrowland. It was the third spinning rocket attraction in Tomorrowland and stood three stories above the ground. When Tomorrowland was redone for 1998, the Rocket Jets were replaced by a new attraction based on Orbitron at the entrance to Discoveryland in Disneyland Park Paris.\n\nThe Rocket Jets remained in their place above the former PeopleMover station as the Observatron, a sculpture that was intended to spin and play music every fifteen minutes. There are only two tracks, from (Space Mountain: From the Earth to the Moon) and Le Visionarium (The Timekeeper), both of which are defunct Disneyland Paris attractions (De la Terre à la Lune is now Space Mountain: Mission 2, while The Timekeeper was also an attraction at the Magic Kingdom in Florida). The rockets were replaced by satellite dishes and the Saturn V rocket in the center was replaced by a laser-beam. However, the Observatron often malfunctioned, as the machinery was built to operate more frequently and to carry the rockets, rather than the satellite dishes they were replaced with. It appeared to have mechanical issues, sometimes only playing music every 15 minutes, or not doing anything at all.\n\nIn late 2006, the Observatron received much needed maintenance which allows the Observatron to now rotate every 15 minutes while playing its music as originally planned. As part of the maintenance, the old speakers were replaced with new ones and new speakers were added. Since this maintenance, the Observatron rarely breaks down and operates on a daily basis as intended.\n\nThe Saturn V rocket that the rockets were attached to was sold on eBay by Disney Auction in 2005. One remains on display, along with Skyway gondolas, in \"Little Green Men Store Command\" with a space ranger design. During Disneyland's 50th anniversary, one of the satellite dishes was replaced by a 50 Mickey Mouse head.\n\nThe Rocket Jets appear in a scene from the Disney animated film \"Meet the Robinsons\" alongside another Disneyland attraction, Space Mountain. The area they are shown in is known as \"Todayland\".\n\nThe poster of the attraction appears as an easter egg in \"Monsters, Inc.\" on the kid bedroom during the scene when Mike Wazowski tries to make the kid laugh.\n\n"}

Channel 13 lost the CBS affiliation when WREC-TV (channel 3, now WREG-TV) signed on in January 1956, assuming the affiliation through the CBS Radio Network's longtime affiliation with radio station WREC (600 AM); WHBQ-TV then became an exclusive ABC affiliate. General Teleradio, the broadcasting arm of the General Tire and Rubber Company, purchased the WHBQ stations in March 1954. In 1955, General Tire purchased RKO Radio Pictures in order to give its television stations a programming source outside of network content and locally produced shows. RKO was merged into General Teleradio; General Tire's broadcasting and film divisions were later renamed RKO General in 1957.\n\nRKO General was under nearly continuous investigation from the 1960s onward due to a long history of lying to advertisers and regulators. For example, it was nearly forced out of broadcasting in 1980 after misleading the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about corporate misconduct at parent General Tire. Under longtime general manager Alex Bonner, WHBQ-AM-FM-TV was never accused of any wrongdoing. The regulatory pressure on RKO General continued unabated until 1987, when an FCC administrative law judge ruled the company unfit to be a broadcast licensee due to its rampant dishonesty. After the FCC advised RKO that appealing the decision was not worth the effort, RKO began unwinding its broadcast operations. The WHBQ stations were the next-to-last to be sold (with WHBQ-TV being the last TV station sold by RKO General), shortly after Bonner retired in 1990. The new owner, Adams Communications, sold off WHBQ radio (WHBQ-FM had been sold off several years earlier).\n\nAdams was in severe financial straits by 1994, and sold the station to the Communications Corporation of America; the sale was finalized on August 17 of that year. Only a short time later, ComCorp sold WHBQ-TV to the News Corporation, then-owner of the Fox network (which spun off the majority of its entertainment holdings to 21st Century Fox in July 2013); the sale closed on July 5, 1995. After the sale was closed, News Corporation had to run the station for over five months as an ABC affiliate, as WPTY's affiliation contract with Fox did not expire until November 30. Fox had signed a deal with New World Communications the year prior to switch the network affiliations of most of its \"Big Three\"-affiliated stations to the network. News Corporation's purchase of channel 13 built on this, and was in part positioning to have a station in a market that was, at the time, in contention for landing an NFL team (Fox had just gained the broadcast rights to the league's National Football Conference division in 1994, however, the anticipated team never came to Memphis).\n\nWhen the station's affiliation agreement with ABC ended on December 1, 1995, Fox programming moved to WHBQ-TV (becoming the third Memphis station to affiliate with the network – WMKW-TV [channel 30, now WLMT] had been the area's original Fox affiliate from the network's October 1986 launch until it moved to WPTY in 1990); outgoing Fox station WPTY became the market's ABC affiliate. Upon the network switch, channel 13 replaced ABC's soap opera lineup with children's programs from Fox Kids (later 4Kids TV), unlike most of the other stations that switched to Fox between 1994 and 1996. WHBQ is the only television station in the Memphis market that has never changed its call letters or channel allocation, and the only one to have been an owned-and-operated station of any major network. It was also the smallest Fox O&O by market size (if WOGX in Gainesville, Florida, market #163, is not counted due to its status as a semi-satellite of WOFL in Orlando).\n\nOn June 13, 2007, News Corporation placed WHBQ-TV and eight other stations up for sale. Local TV, a broadcast holding company controlled by private equity firm Oak Hill Capital Partners, purchased the other eight stations on December 22. WHBQ-TV was not included in the sale as Local TV already owned CBS affiliate WREG-TV—FCC rules prohibit duopolies between two of the four highest-rated television stations in a media market. On January 16, 2009, Fox Television Stations withdrew WHBQ-TV from the market as the only interested buyers (other than Local TV) that were willing to pay anywhere close to the asking price were groups that already owned stations in Memphis, Newport Television (then-owner of WPTY and WLMT, which have since been divested to the Nexstar Broadcasting Group) and Raycom Media (owner of WMC-TV). In December 2008, Fox discontinued children's programming as a result of its removal of the 4Kids TV block, replacing it with the infomercial block \"Weekend Marketplace\". On June 6, 2012, WHBQ-TV became the last Fox-owned station outside of its MyNetworkTV sister stations to switch from the EndPlay CMS platform (spun off from Fox Interactive Media) to a new Worldnow-hosted platform now used by all of the other Fox-owned stations.\n\nOn June 24, 2014, Fox Television Stations announced that it would trade WHBQ-TV and Boston sister station WFXT to the Cox Media Group in exchange for acquiring Cox's San Francisco duopoly of Fox affiliate KTVU (which has been the network's largest affiliate for several years) and independent station KICU-TV. WHBQ remains a Fox affiliate through a long-term affiliation agreement with the network. The trade was completed on October 8, 2014.\n\nIn February 2019, it was announced that Apollo Global Management would acquire Cox Media Group and Northwest Broadcasting's stations. Although the group planned to operate under the name Terrier Media, it was later announced in June 2019 that Apollo would also acquire Cox's radio and advertising businesses, and retain the Cox Media Group name. The sale was completed on December 17, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWHBQ-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 53, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era VHF channel 13 for post-transition operations.\n\nIn addition to the Fox network schedule, syndicated programs broadcast by WHBQ include \"The Wendy Williams Show\", \"The Real\", \"Tamron Hall\", \"Judge Jerry\", \"Judge Judy\" and \"Access Hollywood\".\n\nDespite being one of ABC's stronger affiliates during the 1960s and 1970s (and as pointed out in a sales video made in 1964, was billed as the third most-watched ABC affiliate in the United States), WHBQ-TV often did not air some ABC programs in pattern, particularly those on the network's daytime lineup. Many of these programs were preempted outright or aired on a delay during the overnight hours. In some cases, the preemptions occurred because RKO General was skeptical of airing subject matter deemed even mildly controversial (presumably to keep from offending viewers in Memphis' more conservative suburbs and the surrounding rural areas). Additionally, its program director, Lance Russell, had conservative tastes when it came to television programming, and these were also reflected in the amount of preemptions made by channel 13. For example, it was one of several ABC affiliates that did not clear \"Hot l Baltimore\", which featured one of the first openly homosexual couples featured on American television; Russell appeared on-screen on the night of that series' premiere telecast explaining the preemption. In September 1977, WHBQ-TV was one of eight ABC affiliates that refused to carry the controversial sitcom \"Soap\", replacing it with repeats of \"My Three Sons\" and \"Green Acres\". When \"Soap\" proved to be a runaway hit for the network, channel 13 acquiesced and allowed the series to be rerun in the late night hours during the summer. The following fall, the station began carrying \"Soap\" in its regular primetime slot. \n\nIn many other cases, however, channel 13 opted to preempt network shows in favor of local programs in hopes of earning more local advertising revenue. For instance, in 1972, WHBQ-TV (whose AM sister was a Top 40 powerhouse at the time) stunned viewers in the Mid-South by dropping \"American Bandstand\" (and, with it, weaker and low-rated cartoons that aired in the 11 a.m. slot; the \"ABC Weekend Special\", which took that spot in 1977, would not be cleared until 1980) in favor of airing a 90-minute live professional wrestling program, hosted by Russell, that was previously a fixture on late Saturday afternoons when it first premiered in 1958, until it moved to the Saturday 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. slot. While that program moved to WMC-TV in 1977, channel 13 continued to preempt \"Bandstand\" until 1984, three years before ABC canceled the long-running series. The preemption kept Memphians from seeing homegrown talent perform on the show, such as The Sylvers, Al Green, Isaac Hayes, Anita Ward, The Staple Singers and Rick Dees, who was hired by WHBQ radio as its new morning host during his \"Disco Duck\" days in late 1976. At the time Dees appeared on \"Bandstand\", \"Disco Duck\" was never played on any of the radio stations in Memphis, including WHBQ-AM, because Dees was still employed at rival WMPS (then at 680 AM) at the time.\n\nChannel 13 made up for the preemption by airing \"Bandstand\"s syndicated rival, \"Soul Train\", on Saturday nights until independent station WPTY-TV (channel 24, now ABC affiliate WATN-TV) purchased the local rights to that program in 1983. It was one of the largest ABC affiliates to decline to air \"AM America\" when it debuted in 1975 and the station also initially didn't clear its successor \"Good Morning America\"; the latter program would not air on the station until 1977, initially for only an hour. Other popular shows that WHBQ-TV held out until later (when they became major out-of-the-box hits on ABC) included \"Dark Shadows\" (which featured actor Don Briscoe, who would later reside and died in Memphis), \"S.W.A.T.\", \"Kids Are People Too\", and \"The Bionic Woman\". In 1980, the station was criticized for carrying paid religious programming instead of ABC's coverage of the United States men's hockey team's gold medal victory over Finland in the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York.\n\nLocally, the station had a rivalry with WREC/WREG-TV over bragging rights for the largest movie library in the market. Through its ownership by RKO General, channel 13 had rights to the entire RKO Pictures film catalog. The station's reliance on classic and public domain films during the 1960s and 1970s was evidenced in its daily noon to 2 p.m. airing of the \"Million Dollar Movie\" (and later, the 9–11 a.m. airing of \"Dialing for Dollars\"), which the station ran instead of popular daytime soap operas \"All My Children\" and \"Ryan's Hope\", or in some cases, reruns of ABC prime time sitcoms that aired in the late morning hours. In September 1978, channel 13 finally began clearing the full ABC daytime lineup. However, for many years after that, its noon newscast resulted in \"All My Children\" being aired in a morning timeslot on a one-day delay.\n\nOn September 29, 1962, WHBQ-TV premiered \"Fantastic Features\", a showcase of classic horror films from the RKO Pictures library. The series was hosted by a Transylvanian-styled vampire named Sivad, played by Watson Davis. The show's opening sequence, which included film footage of Sivad riding through a misty forest in a horse-drawn hearse (filmed at Overton Park), proved so unsettling to some children that the series was moved from its original 6:00 p.m. timeslot on Saturdays to 10:30 p.m. At the height of its popularity, \"Fantastic Features\" aired on both Friday and Saturday nights. The program ended on February 5, 1972, after 623 episodes (although the final two years reran older films as the station was receiving more raunchier horror films whose content Davis did not feel comfortable airing and wanted the show to remain family-friendly), though Sivad has remained a well-remembered local personality. There were several attempts to resurrect the character, though a retired Watson Davis refused all offers, the sole exception being promos for the syndicated run of \"Dark Shadows\", when it was acquired by WHBQ in April 1982. Davis died on May 23, 2005, and was buried in Monroe County, Arkansas.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, WHBQ produced several local programs featuring local personalities. Disc jockey George Klein hosted \"Talent Party\", an afternoon rock-and-roll series aimed at Memphis' teenage audience, and gave many garage bands their first television appearances; \"Talent Party\" was very successful, with ratings that were so high that it regularly beat the nationally top-rated CBS soap opera \"The Edge of Night\" on WREC/WREG.\n\nTwo other WHBQ programming staples were \"Happy Hal's Funhouse\" and \"Cartoon Time\", hosted by Hal Miller. While he hosted both children's programs twice daily and on Saturday mornings (doing so from 1957 to 1974), it also provided Miller with the opportunity to sell toy products from his local toy store during his telecasts. Another children's show that aired on WHBQ from 1955 to 1957 was \"Mars Patrol\", which featured a young Wink Martindale who presented segments of Flash Gordon film serials and interviewed local school children seated in a mock 'spaceship'. Martindale later became a popular television game show host.\n\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, news anchor Marge Thrasher hosted a local talk show titled \"Straight Talk\" (a title used on other RKO General stations), that aired at 8:00 a.m. on weekdays. WHBQ was also the Memphis broadcaster of the hybrid local/syndicated program \"PM Magazine\" featuring Byron Day and Linn Sitler.\n\nWHBQ-TV presently broadcasts 53½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 9 hours on weekdays, 4 hours on Saturdays and 4½ hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output of any television station in both the Memphis market and the state of Tennessee. As is standard with Fox stations that carry early evening weekend newscasts, WHBQ's Saturday and Sunday 5:00 p.m. newscasts are subject to preemption due to network sports telecasts that are scheduled to overlap into the timeslot. WHBQ was one of four Fox O&Os to air a 5:00 p.m. newscast, but not a 6:00 p.m. newscast – along with Austin's KTBC, Houston's KRIV and Minneapolis' KMSP-TV (the network's Boston O&O WFXT was included in this distinction until September 2009, when the reverse became true after the station \"moved\" its 5:00 p.m. newscast to 6:00 p.m.; WFXT restored a 5:00 p.m. newscast in September 2013).\n\nWHBQ's newscasts, for many years, had been branded as \"Eyewitness News\" and stayed true to that format's \"Happy Talk\" element, along with using the \"Cool Hand Luke\" music package that was used by ABC's owned-and-operated stations. WHBQ had a number of highly-visible anchors and reporters during the 1970s and 1980s, including Ed Craig, Tom Bearden, Marge Thrasher, Fran Fawcett, Jim Jaggers and Charlie B. Watson. After Fox acquired the station in 1995, the station expanded its newscasts: its weekday morning newscast expanded from one hour to three, with the addition of a two-hour block from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m., the 6:00 p.m. newscast was removed in favor of expanding the 5:00 p.m. news to one hour, and the late evening newscast was moved from 10:00 to 9:00 p.m. and expanded to one hour. The newscasts were also briefly retitled \"Fox 13 Eyewitness News\", before the title was truncated to \"Fox 13 News\" in 1997. Despite this change (and even rivals WPTY-TV and WLMT branding their newscasts under the \"Eyewitness News\" title for several years starting in 2002), WHBQ has retained the \"Happy Talk\" format to this day.\n\nOn June 23, 2009, WHBQ-TV became the second television station in Memphis (behind WMC-TV) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. On September 7, 2009, the station's weekday morning newscast \"Good Morning Memphis\" was expanded to five hours, with the addition of an hour-long block at 9:00 a.m.; an additional half-hour from 4:30 to 5:00 a.m. was added to the program on April 26, 2010. WHBQ restored a 10:00 p.m. newscast to its schedule on August 16, 2010, marking the first time since the December 1, 1995, affiliation switch that channel 13 has aired a late newscast in direct competition with WREG, WMC-TV and WPTY (now WATN-TV). On August 3, 2013, WHBQ launched a two-hour Saturday edition of \"Good Morning Memphis\", airing from 6:00 to 8:00 a.m. On July 6, 2014, WHBQ expanded its weekend morning newscasts to Sundays, also airing from 6:00 to 8:00 a.m.\n\n\nWHBQ-TV was the default Fox affiliate for the Jonesboro, Arkansas media market since Fox did not have a local outlet in that area. However, on June 1, 2015, KJNB-LD became the Fox affiliate for Jonesboro. WHBQ was carried on Suddenlink cable in Jonesboro.\n\nWHBQ was also carried in the Jackson, Tennessee DMA; however, has since been dropped for Jackson's WJKT, whose master control operations are housed in the facilities of Memphis ABC affiliate WATN-TV and CW affiliate WLMT.\n\n\n"}

The union came into existence on 1 July 1994 with the amalgamation of the Public Sector, Professional, Scientific, Research, Technical, Communication, Aviation and Broadcasting Union (\"PSU\") with the State Public Service Federation ( \"SPSF\" ). The CPSU is one of the largest trade unions in Australia with 120,000 members.\n\nFor historical and administrative reason, the CPSU operates through two groups: the SPSF Group and the PSU Group. The SPSF Group (State Public Service Federation) represents the State public sector employees, some former public sector employees, and university professional staff. The PSU Group (Public Services Union) represents Commonwealth government employees, Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory employees, and employees in former Commonwealth government entities. These groups reflect the pre-existing eligibility and industrial coverage of the amalgamating organisations.\n\nThe CPSU has over 120,000 members, with 48,913 members in the PSU Group (which includes the CSIRO Section) and 74,869 members in the State Public Service Federation (SPSF) Group, as of 30 June 2018. The CPSU is affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the CPSU PSU Group is affiliated with the Australian Labor Party (ALP).\n\nThe State Public Service Federation (SPSF Group) was first registered as a federal union on 30 July 1976. Initially, the SPSF covered a limited range of State public sector employees because of constitutional limitations, as it was unclear until the 1980s how widely the SPSF was able to operate, particularly as a party to industrial disputes. Starting with the decision of the High Court in the CYSS case (1983) (on the extent of the conciliation and arbitration power), it appeared that these constraints were eroding.\nIn 1984 the SPSF changed its rules in order that its eligibility paralleled that of the State registered unions that made up the SPSF.\n\nThese State unions are called \"Associated Bodies\". The Associated Bodies have a very long history, extending in most cases from the 19th century. For instance, the Associated Body for the NSW Branch is the Public Service Association of NSW, which celebrated 100 years of existence as a public sector union in NSW, in 1999.\n\nWith the exception of university employees and members in Victoria, referred\n\nThe SPSF Group consists primarily of State public sector unions which are registered in their respective State industrial tribunal. The primary exception is the Victorian Branch which operates completely in the National System since Victoria referred the industrial relations power to the Commonwealth Government in 1996 by the then Premier Jeff Kennett. Other areas of the SPSF membership in the national system are Professional Staff in universities, Disability and Home Care employees who were progressively privatised in NSW, Professional Staff in the Electricity Generation and Distribution sector in NSW, the Land Registry Service in NSW leased from the NSW Land Titles Office, and Administrative and Support Staff employed by TAFE NSW.\n\n\nThe CPSU SPSF Group uses the branding of \"The Professional Staff Union\" due to its representation of only professional staff throughout higher education. Along with their Associated Bodies representing administrative and support staff through state-based schools and TAFEs, nationwide the CPSU is the largest union representing public education employees from kindergarten to university.\n\nIn NSW, the CPSU's new website is at www.cpsunsw.org.au/\n\nThe PSU Group represents Commonwealth or Federal public service employees as well as Territory public service (ACT and NT). This generally reflects the industrial coverage as well as the employer.\n\n\n\n"}

He served as the first Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet, an office created in May 1911 to replace the Grand Council.\n\nYikuang was born in the Aisin-Gioro clan as the eldest son of Mianxing (綿性), a lesser noble who held the title of a \"buru bafen fuguo gong\". He was adopted by his uncle, Mianti (綿悌), who held the title of a third class \"zhenguo jiangjun\". His grandfather was Yonglin, the 17th son of the Qianlong Emperor and the first in line in the Prince Qing peerage, one of the 12 \"iron-cap\" princely peerages of the Qing dynasty.\n\nYikuang inherited the title of a \"fuguo jiangjun\" in 1850 and was promoted to \"beizi\" in 1852. In January 1860, the Xianfeng Emperor further elevated Yikuang to the status of a \"beile\". In October 1872, after the Tongzhi Emperor married Empress Xiaozheyi, he promoted Yikuang to a \"junwang\" (second-rank prince) and appointed him as a \"yuqian dachen\" (御前大臣; a senior minister reporting directly to the emperor).\n\nIn March 1884, during the Guangxu Emperor's reign, Yikuang was put in charge of the Zongli Yamen (the \"de facto\" foreign affairs ministry) and given the title \"Prince Qing of the Second Rank\" (慶郡王). In September 1885, he was tasked with assisting Prince Chun in overseeing maritime and naval affairs. In February 1886, he was awarded the privilege of entering the inner imperial court to meet the emperor. In January 1889, he was given an additional appointment: \"you zongzheng\" (右宗正; Right Director of the Imperial Clan Court). After the Guangxu Emperor married Empress Xiaodingjing in 1889, he granted additional privileges to Yikuang. In 1894, when Empress Dowager Cixi celebrated her 60th birthday, she issued an edict promoting Yikuang to the status of a \"qinwang\" (first-rank prince), hence Yikuang was formally known as \"Prince Qing of the First Rank\". \n\nAround October 1894, during the First Sino-Japanese War, Yikuang was appointed to the positions of high commissioner of the admiralty, the Zongli Yamen, and of war operations, with the latter becoming a quasi-general headquarters.\n\nYikuang was involved in the \"sale\" of official positions, in which a person could obtain an official post through the prince's recommendation by paying him a certain sum of money. He became a \"go-to person\" for backroom deals in politics.\n\nDuring the Boxer Rebellion from 1899 to 1901, Yikuang was more sympathetic towards the foreigners whereas Zaiyi (Prince Duan) sided with the Boxers against the foreigners. Two factions were formed in the Qing imperial court – one comprised a number of \"moderate\" pro-foreign politicians, including Yikuang, while another xenophobic faction was headed by Zaiyi. However, Yikuang was discredited for his pro-foreign stance when a multi-national military force marched into Beijing during the Seymour Expedition of 1900. He was immediately replaced by the \"reactionary\" Zaiyi as the leader of the Zongli Yamen (the foreign affairs ministry). Qing imperial forces and Boxers, acting under Zaiyi's command, defeated Seymour's first expedition. Yikuang even wrote letters to foreigners, inviting them to take shelter in the Zongli Yamen during the Siege of the International Legations, when Zaiyi's men besieged the Beijing Legation Quarter. Another pro-foreign general, Ronglu, offered to provide escorts to the foreigners when his soldiers were supposed to be killing foreigners. Yikuang and Zaiyi's forces clashed several times. Yikuang ordered his own Bannermen to attack the Boxers and the Kansu Braves.\n\nYikuang was then sent by Empress Dowager Cixi, along with Li Hongzhang, to negotiate for peace with the Eight-Nation Alliance after they invaded Beijing in 1901. Yikuang and Li Hongzhang signed the Boxer Protocol on 7 September 1901. During the conference, Yikuang was seen as a representative while the actual negotiations were done by Li Hongzhang. Returning to Beijing as a senior member of the imperial court, Yikuang persisted in his old ways, and was despised by not only reformers, but also by moderate court officials.\n\nIn June 1901, the Zongli Yamen was converted to the Waiwubu (外務部; foreign affairs ministry), with Yikuang still in charge of it. In December, Yikuang's eldest son, Zaizhen, was made a \"beizi\". In discussions over Manchuria, Yikuang \"was bolder in resisting the Russians [than Li Hongzhang], though he was in the last resort weak and unable to hold out against pressure. The Japanese regarded him as a 'nonentity' but this judgment may have been influenced by the fact that he did not often accept their advice.\" He was also appointed to the Grand Council in March 1903. Later that year, he was put in charge of the finance and defence ministries – in addition to his position as head of the foreign affairs ministry. However, he was also relieved of his duties as a \"yuqian dachen\" (御前大臣) and replaced by his eldest son, Zaizhen.\n\nAfter the Guangxu Emperor died on 14 November 1908, Empress Dowager Cixi chose Zaifeng (Prince Chun)'s two-year-old son, Puyi, to be the new emperor. Puyi was \"adopted\" into the emperor's lineage, hence he was nominally no longer Zaifeng's son. Empress Dowager Cixi died on the following day.\nPuyi ascended the throne as the Xuantong Emperor, with his biological father, Zaifeng (Prince Chun), serving as regent. In 1911, Zaifeng abolished the Grand Council and replaced it with an \"Imperial Cabinet\", after which he appointed Yikuang as the Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet (內閣總理大臣).\n\nWhen the Wuchang Uprising broke out in October 1911, Yikuang stepped down as Prime Minister, offering his position to Yuan Shikai instead, and appointed himself as the Chief Executive of the Bideyuan (弼德院; a government body established in May 1911 which provided advice to the emperor). Yikuang and Yuan Shikai persuaded Empress Dowager Longyu (Empress Xiaodingjing) to abdicate on behalf of the Xuantong Emperor. The empress dowager heeded their advice in February 1912.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China, Yikuang and his eldest son, Zaizhen, amassed a fortune and moved from Beijing to the British concession in Tianjin. They later moved back to the Prince Qing Residence (慶王府) at No. 3, Dingfu Street in Beijing's Xicheng District.\n\nYikuang died of illness in 1917 in his residence. Puyi awarded him the posthumous title \"Prince Qingmi of the First Rank\" (慶密親王). In the same year, Li Yuanhong, the President of the Republic of China, gave Zaizhen permission to inherit the Prince Qing peerage.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117260", "title": "Enemy Zero", "text": "Enemy Zero\n\nIn \"Enemy Zero\", gameplay sequences alternate between interactive full motion video (FMV) and real time exploration, both from a first person perspective. The interactive FMV component uses gameplay identical to an earlier Warp game, \"D\".\n\nThe real time component of \"Enemy Zero\" is unique. Enemies are invisible, and location is only possible through the use of sound, with notes of different pitch helping the player find the distance and direction of enemies. Additionally, every gun in the game must be charged up immediately before each shot, and charging a shot for too long will cause the charge to dissipate, after which the charging must start over. Since all available guns have very limited range, this makes timing crucial; beginning to charge the gun too late or too soon will allow the enemy to reach Laura, resulting in an immediate game over. Reloading the gun and moving the character around are mechanics that have been made intentionally slow, which stimulates players to avoid combat and direct contact with the alien enemies as much as possible. In the early segments of the game, avoiding detection is not only recommended; it is required, since the player has no means to defend themselves without a gun.\n\nAboard the AKI space craft, a space station dedicated to biological research, Laura Lewis is in a deep cryogenic slumber. The jets of the chamber dissipate as the craft's emergency systems are activated. Laura is awakened by a large detonation on her deck. Outside a door marked with the letters E0, something of great strength is trying to break free. The door is thrown down, and the hallway is filled with a bright, incandescent light, followed by a horrific growl. Pipes and the remains of the steel door shift around, as if being stepped on. Laura, unaware of what is happening, uses the video phone above her sleep chamber to contact one of her crewmates, Parker. Laura watches in confusion as Parker looks away from the monitor, to his room's entryway doors. A screech sends him backing up to reach for his gun. Laura watches as Parker is mutilated by an unseen enemy.\n\nGetting dressed and grabbing her gun, Laura heads out to learn what attacked Parker. As she ventures through the ship, Laura's earring-shaped \"guidance system\" gives her aural warnings of invisible enemies (seen escaping in the intro sequence) roaming the ship's corridors. Laura meets up with Kimberley, another crewmate, and they make a plan to rendezvous with the other survivors. On their way Kimberley is attacked by an enemy and disappears, forcing Laura to make the journey on her own. She meets up with George, the ship's resident computer scientist, as well as David, her lover, and together they plan to head for the escape shuttles. Exploring the deceased captain's study, Laura discovers a log file that reveals that goal of the mission is to capture the enemies and bring them back to Earth for use as biological weapons on behalf of Vexx Industries, and that the crew is expendable in case of an accident.\n\nDavid is attacked by one of the enemies, and when Laura discovers his corpse, she learns that David was actually an android. She performs a body-scan on herself, and finds that not only is she also an android herself, but that one of the enemy larvae is developing in her neck. George confronts her and tries to wipe her memories, but is attacked and killed by an enemy. When Laura heads for the escape pods, she finds Kimberley again, who kills the larva nesting inside of Laura, and reveals that she and Parker were assigned by Vexx Industries to supervise the mission. Kimberley then triggers the ship's self-destruct mechanism, and leaves Laura to join Parker, killing herself while cradled up next to his corpse. As Laura heads for the escape shuttle, her guidance system runs out of battery, but instead she receives guidance from David, whose consciousness has been uploaded to the ship's computer systems. Laura reaches the escape shuttle just in time as the AKI blows up behind her, and she enters cryogenic sleep one more time as she makes the return voyage to Earth.\n\n\"Enemy Zero\" began life on Sony's PlayStation. Its unveiling at the 1996 PlayStation Expo in Tokyo was described by journalists as the highlight of the show. Irritated by Sony's failure to meet even a third of preorders for the PlayStation version of \"D\" (and to a lesser extent, their policy that all marketing for third party games had to be approved by them), at a press conference during the expo Kenji Eno made a shocking move. Eno showed a preview of \"Enemy Zero\". At the end of the clip the PlayStation logo appeared, but slowly transitioned into the Sega Saturn logo, indicating that the game would now be a Saturn exclusive. Despite popular opinion that the Saturn cannot handle 3D games as well as the PlayStation, Eno commented \"...the PlayStation and the Saturn aren't that different, so moving it [Enemy Zero] to Saturn wasn't too difficult.\" Fumito Ueda, director of the cult video games \"Ico\" and \"Shadow of the Colossus\", worked as an animator on this game, before becoming a video game director. The game was in development for nine months.\n\nThe full motion video sequences were all rendered on Silicon Graphics workstations using PowerAnimator.\n\nWhile Eno did the music for \"D\", Michael Nyman, composer for films such as \"Gattaca\" and \"The Piano\", was hired to create a score for this Warp title. In an interview, Kenji Eno explained how this came about: ...I like Michael Nyman a lot, and I like his soundtracks, so I was thinking that it would be awesome if I could get him to do the music. I thought, \"That would be impossible, but it'd be great if that happened.\" ...then, there was a big earthquake in Kobe, Japan in 1995, and Michael Nyman was donating pianos to schools in the city. When this earthquake happened, he said that he wanted to check out how the pianos that he donated were doing, so he came to Japan. When I found out that he was in Japan, I invited him back to my hotel room and tried to convince him, for six hours, to come work with me. So, at the end, Michael was like, \"OK, I'll do it, I'll do it. Just let me go back to my room.\" So he went back exhausted after being convinced for six hours. We didn't work out terms or conditions; he just said that he would do it.\n\nEno had initially considered asking Ryuichi Sakamoto to create the score, but decided that his style would not be appropriate for the game.\n\nThe music was performed by the Michael Nyman Orchestra and Sarah Leonold [sic<nowiki>]</nowiki>. \"Confusion\" is a modification of material from Nyman's previous score, \"The Ogre\", while the Enemy Zero/Invisible Enemy/Battle theme were modified into portions of Nyman's score for \"Man with a Movie Camera\". The main theme is a variation on \"Bird Anthem\" from \"Michael Nyman\".\n\n\"Laura's Theme,\" \"Digital Tragedy,\" and \"Love Theme\" are solo piano works and are included on the EP, \"Enemy Zero Piano Sketches\", which was released eight months before the complete soundtrack, and two months before the game.\n\n\nReleased and received with much hype in Japan at the end of 1996, E0 was released in North America and Europe in 1997 under Sega. It was later ported to the PC by Sega.\n\n20 copies of a limited edition of the Saturn version were produced and sold for a price roughly equal to 2,000 US dollars. These special copies were hand-delivered to recipients by Kenji Eno himself. The game thus holds the record for the \"Most Exclusive Special Edition\" of a video game, according to the 2012 \"Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition\". Due to popularity in Japan, Sega sponsored the production of a few \"Enemy Zero\" items such as the official \"Enemy Zero\" soundtrack by Michael Nyman, a model of the in-game gun, and a strategy guide.\n\nPrior to \"Enemy Zero\"s release, John Ricciardi made it his pick for \"Sleeper Hit of the Holidays\", commenting that \"I've yet to play an English version of the game (fortunately the Japanese one isn't too dependent on text), but I'm happy with what I've played of the import and I was a big fan of \"D\".\"\n\n\"Enemy Zero\" received favorable reviews from several publications. \"Edge\" highly praised the first of the game's three discs for offering a \"suspense-ridden atmosphere\" and tense encounters with invisible aliens, comparing it favorably to Ridley Scott's cult classics \"Alien\" and \"Blade Runner\". However, the magazine criticized the other discs for ruining that suspense with \"space soap\" themes and an almost embarrassing plot. \"Electric Playground\" concluded that \"Enemy Zero\" \"is one of the best Saturn games\" of the year and its \"high points are the innovations, like the energy gun and the VPS, that make playing this game unlike playing any other.\"\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Saturn version of the game, rating it four stars out of four, and stated that \"Not only is \"Enemy Zero\" a fine adventure, but it also manages to advance the graphic adventure by emphasizing other senses besides pure sight. It may still have some of the faults of FMV-plagued games, but those problems dwindle to nothing compared to the overall experience.\"\n\nUlrich Steppberger of \"Maniac Games\" scored it just 37 out of 100, saying that although the game replicates the ambiance of the film \"Alien\", it has many problems that weigh the game down. He says the game has problems typical of FMV games such as trudging through long barren corridors and solving puzzles. He also said the weapon was unwieldy and hard to use, the ping system to find the enemy is not useful, while saying the FMV were high quality. \n\nIn 1997, French magazine \"Consoles +\" scored it 89% overall, including individual ratings of 90% for presentation, 91% for graphics, 83% animation, 87% music, 82% sound effects, 90% lastability, and 90% playability. They concluded that, while it might not please everyone, it is a \"gory, original and beautiful\" adventure game with \"high difficulty\" and a \"special atmosphere\". British magazine \"Mean Machines\" scored it 90% overall, including individual ratings of 91% for graphics, 89% for sound, 85% playability, and 69% lastability.\n\nAmerican magazine \"GameFan\" awarded the game the Megaward for Best Import Game of the Year, for the year 1996.\n"}

He attended Lewis-Clark State in Lewiston, Idaho, and made his major league debut on May 9, . As of the season, he was an area scout for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim based in Issaquah, Washington.\n\nEllison became one of the more recognizable bench players in the major leagues because of how frequently he was brought in to pinch run for Barry Bonds. In , Ellison played center field for all games until the trading deadline, when the Giants acquired Randy Winn and Ellison lost his starting job.\n\nEllison was born in Quincy, California. He attended South Kitsap High School in Port Orchard, Washington.\n\nEllison attended Lewis–Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho. He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 22nd round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft.\n\nEllison was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 22nd round of the First 2000 Major League Baseball Draft. He began his professional career with rookie-league Salem-Keizer Volcanoes where he led the Northwest League in runs with 67, while ranking third in hits with 90 and tying for seventh with .300 batting average. He led Volcanoes in games with 74 played, at-bats with 300, runs, hits, doubles with 15 and stolen bases with 13. He earned Salem-Keizer's Player of Month honors in his first month in pro ball, snagging the June award.\n\nHe spent his second professional campaign with the Class-A Hagerstown Suns in , where he established career highs in runs with 95 and RBIs with 55. Ellison finished among South Atlantic League leaders in doubles, second with 38, runs, second and on-base percentage, third with a .388 clip. His .291 batting average ranked second on Suns, while he paced club with 19 stolen bases. He went 3-for-8 with two home runs and two RBIs in two South Atlantic League post-season games.\n\nIn Ellison split the season between the Class-A San Jose Giants and the Triple-A Fresno Grizzlies, skipping the Double-A level altogether. He combined to hit .286 with 71 runs, 21 doubles, one triple, eight home runs, 48 RBIs and 25 stolen bases in 130 games. His steals total led the Giants minor-league system. Ellison opened the year at San Jose, where he hit .270 with 40 runs, 13 doubles, five home runs, 40 RBIs and nine stolen bases in 81 contests. He earned promotion to Fresno in July and proceeded to hit Pacific Coast League pitching at .311 clip with 31 runs, eight doubles, a triple, and three home runs, eight RBI and 16 stolen bases over 49 contests to close out the 2002 campaign. He was selected Grizzlies' Player of Month for August. Ellison was added to 40-man roster November 21.\n\nEllison spent the majority of the season at Fresno, but also made his Major League debut with Giants. He was recalled from Fresno May 9, taking roster spot of disabled outfielder Marvin Benard. He made his big league debut that evening against the Atlanta Braves, entering in the ninth inning as a defensive replacement in left field. He made his first career start on May 11 at Turner Field, going 1-for-5 with his first hit coming in the sixth inning off Trey Hodges. He appeared in seven games for San Francisco, two starts, going 1-for-10 with a run scored. Ellison was optioned to Fresno on May 18, where he remained rest of campaign. Ellison led Grizzlies with 21 stolen bases, while ranking second in games with 119 played and runs with 74. He hit .295 with 22 doubles, four triples, six home runs and 39 RBIs. He earned Fresno Player of Month award for April and was honored by teammates as \"Harry Jordan\" award winner during spring training, an honor bestowed uponthe best first year player in big league camp.\n\nEllison played in 125 contests for Fresno, boasting a .315 avg. He led Grizzlies in hits with 159, triples with 7 and stolen bases with 27, while ranking second in games with 125 and runs scored with 90 in . He was named Fresno's organizational Player of Month for both June and July. He was tabbed Fresno's Most Inspirational Player. Ellison was called up to San Francisco when rosters were expanded on September 1, marking the second time with big league club. He hit his first Major League home run off the Los Angeles Dodgers Edwin Jackson, a two-run shot on October 3 at Dodger Stadium. Ellison went 2-for-4 with four runs scored, a home run, three RBIs and two stolen bases in 13 contests for the Giants.\n\nIn Ellison emerged as a pleasant surprise for the Giants, earning the majority of club's starts in center field prior to trade-deadline acquisition of Randy Winn and a late-season injury. Despite his limited play in the second half, still ranking among National League rookie leaders in runs with 49, hits with 93, doubles with 18, triples with 2, steals with 14, and outfield assists with 5. He made 82 starts overall, 64 in center field and 18 in right field, hitting .269 with 40 runs, 18 doubles, a triple, three home runs, 23 RBIs, 23 walks and 11 steals. He stole 14 bases, eighth-most ever by a Giants rookie and highest since Marvin Benard swiped 25 in . He was the most productive during early season action, as his average stood above .300 for 66-game stretch from April 8 to June 25. He logged a career-high 8-game hitting streak from May 7 to 14 going 10-for-27, part of stretch in which he hit safely in 15 of 19 games going 23-for-58. Ellison suffered an oblique strain on left side, and appeared in just 17 games after September 1. He logged a brief 10-day stay with Triple-A Fresno, being optioned August 19 when Moisés Alou was activated from disabled list. He returned to the Giants on August 29 following the August 27 trade of Michael Tucker.\n\nThe year was a season of ups and downs for Ellison as he was on the opening-day roster and logged 72 games prior to All-Star Break, but was optioned to Triple-A Fresno before the July 14 second-half opener. He blistered Pacific Coast League pitching to the tune of a .406 average going 78-for-192 with 18 doubles and 18 RBIs in 46 games before being recalled September 1. Ellison appeared in 84 Major League games overall, seeing action at all three outfield positions and as both a pinch-runner and pinch-hitter. He struggled offensively in big leagues, hitting just .222, however he batted .250 as pinch-hitter. He hammered his second career leadoff home run on June 18.\n\nOn April 1, , Ellison was traded to the Seattle Mariners for Travis Blackley, where he served much of the 2007 season as a fourth outfielder.\n\nEllison was a key part of an altercation between the Oakland Athletics and his Seattle Mariners that started after A's pitcher Joe Blanton collided with Mariners outfielder Ichiro Suzuki while retrieving a ball that had gotten away from the A's catcher. Ellison responded by charging Blanton, and a bench clearing scuffle ensued. In spite of this, Ellison was not ejected from the game, and went on to record the first 4-hit game of his major league career. In , Ellison and Blanton became teammates on the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nOn August 3, , the Seattle Mariners designated Ellison for assignment, making room on their 25-man roster for rookie outfielder Adam Jones to be called up from their Triple-A affiliate, the Tacoma Rainiers.\n\nOn August 7, the Cincinnati Reds claimed Ellison off waivers from the Mariners. He finished the season for the Reds and was outrighted to the minor leagues on October 11. He refused the assignment and elected free agency.\n\nOn January 24, , the Texas Rangers signed Ellison to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. After spending most of the season in the minors, Ellison was called up on August 7. He was designated for assignment on August 25, and sent outright to the minors two days later.\n\nOn January 7, , Ellison signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was granted free agency after the '09 season.\nHe now lives In Issaquah,Washington with his wife and 2 children, named Ariana and Jaxon\n\n, or Retrosheet, or Yahoo!

{"id": "2117270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117270", "title": "WREG-TV", "text": "WREG-TV\n\nWREG-TV, virtual channel 3 (UHF digital channel 28), is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Memphis, Tennessee, United States. Its third digital subchannel serves as an owned-and-operated station of the classic TV network Antenna TV. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group. WREG's studios are located on Channel 3 Drive (off of I-55) near the Mississippi River on the west side of Memphis, and its transmitter is located between I-40 and Whitten Road, approximately southeast of Bartlett.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on January 1, 1956 as WREC-TV, and began regular broadcasts the following day on January 2. It was originally owned by electrical engineer and radio dealer Hoyt Wooten (who had applied for one of the first television licenses in the country in 1928), along with WREC radio (AM 600 and FM 102.7, now WEGR). The call letters stood for Wooten's radio store, the Wooten Radio-Electric Company, where he had founded WREC radio in 1922. It took the CBS affiliation from WHBQ-TV (channel 13, which had been a CBS affiliate since it signed on in September 1953), as WREC-AM had been a CBS Radio affiliate since 1929. WREC-TV's original studios were located inside the Peabody Hotel in downtown Memphis.\n\nFor its first six years, WREC-TV was the only locally owned station in Memphis (WHBQ-TV was owned by General Tire and NBC affiliate WMC-TV was owned by Scripps-Howard). However, in 1963, Wooten sold WREC-AM-FM-TV to Cowles Communications, earning a handsome return on his original investment of 40 years earlier. In turn, Cowles sold WREC-TV to The New York Times Company in 1971. Cowles later sold the radio stations to other interests. Four years later, the Times Company built new studio facilities for WREC on one of the highest points on Chickasaw Bluff, overlooking the Mississippi River. The station had long since outgrown the Peabody Hotel, and management felt that building a new studio near the Mississippi would be appropriate since Memphis has long been identified with the river. On March 2, 1975, channel 3 signed off from the Peabody Hotel for the last time as WREC-TV, and signed back on 45 minutes later, re-branded as WREG-TV, with its first transmission from the new studios on Channel 3 Drive. The station also maintained studio space in the Peabody Place shopping center, adjacent to the Peabody Hotel, marking a partial return of sorts to its early years. The studio was shut down in 2011 when Peabody Place closed.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, The New York Times Company announced its intention to sell its nine television stations. On January 4, 2007, the company entered into an agreement with private equity group Oak Hill Capital Partners to sell the stations to the Oak Hill-operated holding company Local TV, the sale was finalized on May 7. On July 1, 2013, Local TV announced that it would sell its stations to Tribune Broadcasting (which formed a management company that operated both Tribune and Local TV's stations in 2008) for $2.75 billion. The sale was completed on December 27.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. Three weeks after the FCC's July 18 vote to have the deal reviewed by an administrative law judge amid \"serious concerns\" about Sinclair's forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties, on August 9, 2018, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal, intending to seek other M&A opportunities. Tribune also filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that Sinclair engaged in protracted negotiations with the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division over regulatory issues, refused to sell stations in markets where it already had properties, and proposed divestitures to parties with ties to Sinclair executive chair David D. Smith that were rejected or highly subject to rejection to maintain control over stations it was required to sell. The termination of the Sinclair sale agreement places uncertainty for the future of Fox's purchases of KSTU and the other six Tribune stations included in that deal, which were predicated on the closure of the Sinclair–Tribune merger.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Irving, Texas-based Nexstar Media Group—which has owned ABC affiliate WATN-TV (channel 24) and CW affiliate WLMT (channel 30) since December 2012—announced it would acquire the assets of Tribune Media for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. Nexstar was precluded from acquiring WREG directly or indirectly while owning WATN/WLMT, as FCC regulations prohibit common ownership of more than two stations in the same media market, or two or more of the four highest-rated stations in the market. (Furthermore, any attempt by Nexstar to assume the operations of WREG through local marketing or shared services agreements would be subject to regulatory hurdles that could delay completion of the FCC and Justice Department's review and approval process for the acquisition.) As such, Nexstar decided to sell WATN to a separate, unrelated company to address the ownership conflict. WLMT does not rank among the top four in total-day viewership and therefore is not in conflict with existing FCC in-market ownership rules; however, Nexstar opted to sell that station alongside WATN. On March 20, 2019, it was announced that Nexstar would sell the WATN/WLMT duopoly to McLean, Virginia-based Tegna Inc. and buy WREG-TV, as part of the company's sale of nineteen Nexstar- and Tribune-operated stations to Tegna and the E. W. Scripps Company in separate deals worth $1.32 billion; this would make the WATN/WLMT duopoly sister stations to NBC affiliate WBIR-TV in Knoxville and CBS affiliate KTHV in Little Rock. The deal was approved by the FCC on September 16 and was completed on September 19, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nThe station became a charter affiliate of Antenna TV upon its launch on January 1, 2011 and is carried on digital subchannel 3.3.\n\nWREG-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 28, using PSIP to display WREG-TV's virtual channel as 3 on digital television receivers.\n\nSyndicated programs seen on WREG-TV include \"Inside Edition\", \"Jeopardy!\", and \"Entertainment Tonight\". The syndicated version of \"Wheel of Fortune\" airs on WMC-TV (channel 5), making the Memphis area one of the few TV markets to air \"Wheel\" and \"Jeopardy!\" on separate stations. \n\nWREG is the only CBS station that preempts \"CBS This Morning Saturday\", airing a three-hour Saturday morning newscast in its place. The station also preempts the Sunday edition of the \"CBS Weekend News\" in order to air an hour-long 5 p.m. newscast. WREG is one of the few stations that preempts a big three network evening newscast (the hour-long early evening newscast inventories of Norfolk NBC affiliate WAVY-TV, Grand Rapids NBC affiliate WOOD-TV and Scranton ABC affiliate WNEP-TV are also limited in a similar fashion with the latter airing local programming in place of the network's evening newscast). Over the years, WREG has produced many local programs, such as \"News Channel 3 Knowledge Bowl\" and \"Mid-South Outdoors\" (later known as \"News Channel 3 Outdoors\"). The station also currently produces \"Live at 9\", a weekday morning program that maintains a talk show-style format and the public affairs program \"Informed Sources\", which airs on Saturday evenings and sometimes Sunday nights and discusses current local issues.\n\nThroughout the early 1960s into the late 1980s, WREC/WREG claimed to possess the largest feature film library of any television station in the United States, which was evidenced in its daily (late afternoons and late nights) and weekend programming lineup at the time. The station used some of those features for theme weeks (such as \"Godzilla Week\" and \"John Wayne Week\"), which proved to be very popular with viewers. However, like most major network affiliates in the early 1980s, WREG-TV began cutting back on the large number of movies that occupied much of its off-network schedule, a move prompted by the presence of cable, VCRs, and the emergence of then-independent competitors WPTY (channel 24, now ABC affiliate WATN-TV) in 1978 and WMKW (channel 30, now CW affiliate WLMT) in 1983.\n\nThe station presently broadcasts 40½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6½ hours on weekdays, 4½ hours on Saturdays and 3½ hours on Sundays). For more than two decades, WREG has been in a Nielsen ratings war for first place with longtime powerhouse WMC-TV. WREG did not actually win a ratings period, however, until February 2006 after it paired former WHBQ anchor Claudia Barr and former WMC morning anchor Richard Ransom as its main evening anchors. Since that time, WREG has gradually built on its wins in the all-important 10 p.m. slot and now consistently dominates that time period. Since the February 2014 sweeps period, the station's newscasts have placed first in all time slots.\n\nOn June 13, 2011 beginning with the 10 p.m. newscast, WREG-TV became the third station in the Memphis market (behind WMC-TV and WHBQ-TV) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. The switch came with a refresh of the newsroom set and new graphics, however major technical glitches occurred during the week following the conversion. In mid-2011, the WREG news studio received a major overhaul with the unveiling of a \"newsplex\" set (designed by FX Group) that occupies a large studio with loft areas and continues into a smaller newsroom area in the back and includes numerous live areas and a set for the \"Live at 9\" program.\n\n\n\nWREG-TV, along with Little Rock's KTHV, previously served as the default CBS affiliates for the Jonesboro, Arkansas area. WREG's signal can reach at least the Jonesboro area, and it is available on Suddenlink cable, as well as the cable system of Paragould Light Water and Cable in the Paragould area. This ended on August 1, 2015, when Jonesboro-based Fox affiliate KJNB-LD signed on the Jonesboro market's first locally based CBS affiliate on its second digital subchannel. This has resulted in the displacement of KTHV from Suddenlink cable, and may also result in the displacement of WREG-TV.\n\nWREG-TV also previously served as the default CBS affiliate for the Jackson, Tennessee media market, along with Nashville's WTVF.

Stella and Daba ally with each other due to their desires to topple Poseidal, but differ greatly on their views. In particular, Daba gets frustrated with Stella's habit of recklessly throwing sums of money to his subordinates, not to mention his multiple attempts to execute his own allies when he suspects them of disloyalty. Stella is eventually killed at his main base of Little Saye. Voiced by Masato Tachizawa.\n\nThe legendary immortal emperor from the planet Gastogal that rules all of Pentagona. Poseidal is easily spotted by his white hair and mismatched eyes; one yellow, one blue. With the power of the bio-relation that harnesses biological energy, he has the ability to control the actions of others and lives forever. He is nearly invincible, particularly in his own Heavy Metal, the Original Auge. After defeating Kamon Walha V, cementing his status as ruler of Pentagona, Poseidal disappears from view, hiding as the wealthy trader Amandara Kamandara. As the battle between the rebellion and the military reaches its climax Poseidal returns to the forefront and battles Daba. He perishes when the bio-relation system that preserves his youth is deactivated.\n\nA wealthy trader who supplies both the military and the rebels with supplies. In actuality, Amandara Kamandara is the real Poseidal, hiding behind the scenes while a puppet is on the throne. A mysterious character throughout the show, Amandara's true intentions come to the surface at the end and he reveals his true persona, Oldna Poseidal. Voiced by Ryuichi Horibe.\n\nOne of Poseidal's former Temple Knights, Mian fell in love with him and eventually completely fell under his control due to the power of the bio-relation. While the bio-relation allowed her to live forever without aging, it also resulted in her becoming little more than a puppet and she was used to pose as Poseidal while he hid. Even she hid from public view for the most part, appearing rarely except as a hologram and wearing a bizarre costume complete with makeup and a wig. As the years passed however the bio-relation system's control slipped and Mian was able to think for herself, against Poseidal much in part due to encounters with Full Flat. Mian would eventually disable the bio-relation system in the heart of Sveto and, like him, age to her death.\n\nLike Mian, Full Flat was one of Poseidal's former Temple Knights and was in love with him. Unlike Mian, Flat was unable to win Poseidal's love, but was given the independent asteroid base Theart Star due to all the help she provided him. Like Poseidal and Mian she possessed eternal youth, but as the decades passed she grew bored with her life and resentful towards Poseidal. Flat eventually seeks to take Poseidal down, first by allying with Giwaza Lowau, who was rebelling against Poseidal, and later heading down to Sveto herself to break Mian from Poseidal's grasp. It was during the second of these encounters where Flat's life came to an end when the L-Gaim Mk-II accidentally crushed her. Voiced by Mika Doi.\n\nA pilot obsessed with joining the military who eventually gets his wish thanks to a recommendation from Amandara Kamandara.

Voiced by Sho Hayami.\n\nDaba's younger half-sister, whom he lost track of. She eventually reappears as a puppet of Poseidal on the spy ship Epsilon. She is promoted over Giwaza, upsetting him enough for him to rebel against Poseidal. This also makes her a target of him, and he eventually manages to kidnap her. Daba and Gavlet (who falls in love with her) eventually rescue Olibee and she assists in them finding Poseidal(Mian) in the heart of Sveto. Although the war eventually ends, Olibee is brain damaged by the anguish caused by the bio-relation that Poseidal used to control her. Voiced by Yumi Kinoshita.\n\nMember of Poseidal's Elite 13 (No. 3). Despite his number, Giwaza is the head of the group, and outside of Poseidal is the highest-ranked member of the Poseidal military.

The lyrics celebrate the birth of his daughter, Aisha Morris. Wonder collaborated on the song with Harlem songwriter and studio owner Burnetta \"Bunny\" Jones.\n\nThe song opens side 3 of \"Songs in the Key of Life\", and starts with a baby's first cry recorded during an actual childbirth. A recording of Wonder bathing Aisha as an older toddler is brought into the final section of the song, mixed with Wonder's extended chromatic harmonica solo. All of the instruments heard in the song are played by Wonder, except for Greg Phillinganes on some of the keyboard parts. During the recording process, bassist Nathan Watts laid down a bass guitar line to serve as a guide track for Wonder, but Wonder eventually replaced this with his own keyboard bass performance.\n\nThe more-than-six-minute song was not released as a single, as Wonder was unwilling to shorten the song to fit the 7\", 45 rpm format. With consumers demanding a single, Tamla compromised in late 1976, and a promotional version was given to radio stations. This edited version, 3:12 in length, received so much airplay that it reached number 23 on the Adult Contemporary chart in January 1977. Since then, the song has become a jazz and pop standard, covered by many artists.\n\nWonder performed the song live for Queen Elizabeth II at her Diamond Jubilee Concert on June 4, 2012, with lyrics modified to refer to the Queen.\n\nTamla released two different versions of the song – the longer album version opens with the sound of a baby crying, and the outro features Aisha as a baby; a promotional single edited for radio leaves out the crying baby sounds at the beginning and has a much shorter outro.\n\nThe song was not issued as a commercial single and therefore it did not appear on the major charts in the US and UK. However, due to radio airplay, it reached number 23 on the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary chart on January 29, 1977.\n\n\n"}

The Canberra office was opened by John Howard, the then Prime Minister of Australia, on Tuesday, 16 September 2003.\n\nThe members of each State, Territory and Federal Police Association/Union are members of the Police Federation of Australia, and the organisation is affiliated with the ACTU. In 2007, Peter Alexander (the then President of the Police Federation of Australia) said the union represented 50,000 officers.\n\nIn 2002 the CEO of the Police Federation of Australia, Mark Burgess, called for a national approach to tackling the problems of hand guns in the community \"I think there needs to be a far greater cooperation and coordination between the Federal Government and the State and Territory Governments. We've said for some time it's unfortunate these things are finding their way into the country and then it's left to State and Territory police officers to clean up the mess and the carnage after they've been used.\"\n\nIn 2005 the Police Federation of Australia supported the fears of the Australian Federal Police Association (AFPA), regarding industrial relations laws relating to Australian Workplace Agreements saying the laws could erode the integrity of police officers. The concerns were rejected by a spokesman for Workplace Relations Minister Kevin Andrews, saying state police would remain in the state systems, and that AFP staff would continue to be governed by their certified agreement.\n\nPresident - Vince Kelly APM (NT)\nVice President - Jon Hunt-Sharman (AFPA)\nVice President - Mark Carroll (SA)\nTreasurer - Scott Weber (NSW)\nChief Executive Officer - Mark Burgess APM\n\nAlthough only recently having been established, the PFA does have an important history. The PFA was formally registered under Federal Industrial law on the 1 January 1998. The Canberra office which is still in use to this day was opened on the 16 of September 2003, by the Prime Minister at that time then, John Howard. Prior to being properly formed as the Federation, the Australian Federal Police Association was the only registered police union federally in Australia at the time. The association came into effect as a result of restructuring of Commonwealth law enforcement along with the creation of the Australian Federal Police. The Association’s national executive committee agreed upon the idea of a national law enforcement union in 1986 as a sole trade union. Through much deliberation and after numerous meetings and countless objections, by state governments and individual police commissioners, the final phase in the formation was the formal change from association to federation. In April 1997, the associations council unanimously agreed that the union change its name to the Police Federation of Australia.\n\nPolice officers on a daily basis have to deal with a wide range of issues within the community. One of those issues, more prevalent than ever today is the issue surrounding mental health. Due to their 24/7 nature, police officers in Australia have been expected to deal with persons presenting with symptoms of mental health disorders within the community. The complexity of these issues has generated a stretch in police resources. This also includes their own mental health when it comes to dealing with these extreme and disturbing signs. Some of these extreme examples include police involved shootings of mentally ill individuals. There has been increased commentary regarding issues that officers face and their mental health. In response to this trend, many officers nationally have expressed their concerns over feeling there is a lack of necessary skills, knowledge and resources to respond and assess appropriately to individuals with mental illness. The consensus amongst officers is that this lack of resources stems from deficient deinstitutionalisation reforms that overtime have crippled Australia’s mental health system. This creates the overburden mentioned for police officers on the front line as responders to mental health issues. This also accounts for police officers regarding simply having to deal with mental health issues in the community. A 2004 survey found that 93% of police officers stated that ‘caring for people with a mental illness is affecting their ability to do core work responsibilities.’ Furthermore, this involvement by police with mental health in the community extends to further boundaries. There is evidence to suggest that officers spend substantial amounts of time across numerous hospitals in the emergency departments in so-called caretaker mode. This effect upon police to wait is due to having to wait for these persons of interest to be properly admitted to a health specialist who can gauged whether they are to be experiencing mental illness or a mental health crisis. These frustrations have been expressed by the Police Federation of Australia and that they impede upon the work of many of the police officers they represent nationally.\n\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, police in Australia have had an important role in protecting the citizens. Police have been the main enforcers of social distancing measures within each of the states and territories. This has put police officers on the very front-line when it comes to interaction with people in the community. Many of these roles had the PFA focusing on the wellbeing of the police officers. This included the monitoring of cruise ships and dealing with those passengers, controlling state borders as well as issuing fines to those who violates the social distancing measures. An important aspect of the measures taken was to stop people from gathering in public places. Most notably, it was prevalent at many of the beaches in the Eastern Suburbs (Sydney) and Northern Beaches of Sydney. Beaches were talked about as being an important place for police officers to show their presence in the aim of warning off people from breaching social distancing and attaining a fine. Particularly at a time where being outside is deemed at being dangerous and only for essential purposes. Some of the social distancing rules that were put in place were confusing to some. Many of the police officers were learning of these changes by finding out through the media. The chief executive officer of the PFA, Scott Weber highlighted that the situation in the community was “a moving feast every day.” Weber then further stated, “When the restrictions were out in place, it was quite clear it was extremely urgent and extremely necessary, and police were very clear with regards to being black and white in enforcing those restrictions.” Due to the role that the police had, the restrictions were regarded to have started to work. Scott Weber also stated that “at the start it was very prescriptive, it was health orientated, and on top of that – people didn’t know where we were heading.” The union backed their officers by taking the situation very seriously and were following the measures put in place for the safety of the community.\n\nThe PFA played an integral role in making sure that police officers were being looked after as they conducted their duties during the pandemic. This role was nonetheless visible regarding the focus upon officers’ wellbeing during the pandemic. There were calls for police officers to be eligible for priority virus testing. Despite being on the frontline, they were unable to receive this eligibility in most states around the country.\n\n"}

Initially the base was called by its original name, Camp Tengan. The first Marine units occupied Quonset huts, Nissen huts and Butler buildings. Most of the huts were \"strong-backed\", which means they had concrete or concrete block ends, with cables strung over them at intervals whose ends were anchored in the ground in concrete, and had wooden hurricane shutters over the windows. This was to protect the buildings during the frequent typhoons that visit the Ryukyu Islands. The original units at Camp Tengan were Headquarters Battalion, the Division Band and a truck battalion. Division Headquarters was mainly in a sprawling, one-story building just inside the main gate. Some other units, such as Division Legal Office, were in separate buildings. There was an Army anti-aircraft battery located adjacent to the camp. That unit used to conduct live-fire exercises once a month. For some new arrivals, the unannounced firing sometimes caused momentary consternation.\n\nCamp Courtney houses many military families, has a movie theater, exchange, commissary, medical and dental clinics, post office, chapel and bank.

{"id": "2117339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117339", "title": "Mike Krukow", "text": "Mike Krukow\n\nMichael Edward Krukow (born January 21, 1952) is an American former professional baseball starting pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies, and San Francisco Giants. He is currently a television color commentator for the Giants.\n\nKrukow attended San Gabriel High School in San Gabriel, California, where he played as a catcher. He was drafted as a catcher by the California Angels in the 32nd round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft but did not sign.\n\nKrukow became a pitcher, and played college baseball for the Cal Poly Mustangs in San Luis Obispo, California. Though his collegiate eligibility was cut short, he still holds the school record for career earned run average at 1.94 and is tied for most shutouts in a season with five.\n\nKrukow was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 8th round of the 1973 draft. Krukow played Major League baseball for the Chicago Cubs (1976–1981), the Philadelphia Phillies (1982) and the San Francisco Giants (1983–1989). He batted and threw right-handed.\n\nKrukow had a solid career in the major leagues. In , after six years with the Cubs, he was dealt to Philadelphia for pitchers Dickie Noles and Dan Larson and outfielder Keith Moreland.\nThe right-handed starter was second only to Steve Carlton in wins, posting a 13–11 record and an impressive 3.12 ERA, but despite this success, the Phillies sent Krukow, Mark Davis and Charlie Penigar to the San Francisco Giants in December in a trade for Joe Morgan and reliever Al Holland. The trade helped Philadelphia win the National League pennant in , but it also gave San Francisco two arms that would become a big part of the Giants' success in the late 1980s.\n\nAlthough known as a starter, Krukow earned his only career save on August 31, 1984, pitching to just one batter (the Phillies' Sixto Lezcano), inducing a game-ending groundout, therefore preserving a 6–5 Giant victory.\n\nKrukow's best season was in , posting a record of 20–9 with a 3.05 ERA pitching for the San Francisco Giants. Krukow finished third in that year's NL Cy Young Award voting behind Mike Scott and Fernando Valenzuela. Krukow was selected to the National League All-Star team that season. He was awarded the Willie Mac Award in both 1985 and 1986 honoring his spirit and leadership. In , Krukow helped lead the Giants to their first division championship in 16 years.\n\nKrukow's 17 no decisions were the most among MLB starting pitchers in 1987, as well as being the most ever by a Giants starter dating back to at least 1908. He made the only postseason appearance of his career in Game 4 of the 1987 National League Championship Series. Krukow was the winning pitcher in a 9 inning complete game, allowing 2 runs on 9 hits, as the Giants beat the St. Louis Cardinals, 4–2. It was the Cardinals, however, that took the series in seven games to reach the World Series.\nOn June 30, , Krukow underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in his pitching shoulder after spending parts of three seasons on the disabled list for what was believed to be bursitis. He retired in March . In his 14-season career, Krukow posted a 124–117 record with 1,478 strikeouts and a 3.90 ERA in 2190.1 innings pitched.\n\nAfter his playing career, Krukow became a radio and television sportscaster. Krukow began broadcasting as an occasional color analyst for KNBR radio in and became a full-time broadcaster in . He is a seven-time Emmy award winner. \"Kruk,\" who was named as the starting right-handed pitcher to the 1980s Giants All- Decade Team in a vote by Bay Area media in 1999, is noted for his deep knowledge of the game and tremendous sense of humor. He is known for his detailed scouting reports on umpires' strike zones.\n\nPart of the San Francisco Giants broadcasting team, Krukow is half of the duo dubbed \"Kruk and Kuip,\" (pronounced \"Kruke\" and \"Kipe\") along with partner Duane Kuiper, a former Giants teammate. Krukow and Kuiper tape a game-day commentary (\"Kruk and Kuip on baseball\") for KNBR radio as part of the Giants' pre-game radio coverage. Notably, although Krukow was a pitcher and Kuiper was a position player, Krukow has five career home runs, four more than Kuiper (who managed only one in his career despite having over 3,000 at-bats).\n\nKrukow has a few \"Kruktionary\" catchphrases, including: \"Grab some pine, meat\"; \"Just another, ha ha ha ha, laugher!\" (after a nail-biter win); and \"I wanna get that!\", the last of which is associated with a product endorsement.\n\nKrukow and Kuiper can be heard as the commentators in Electronic Arts video games \"MVP Baseball\" 2003, 2004 and \"2005\". They include Krukow's familiar \"\"grab some pine, meat\"\" quote.\n\nUntil the summer of 2014, Krukow and his wife Jennifer resided in San Luis Obispo, California, but they moved to Reno, Nevada to be closer to their grandchildren. They have five adult children, Jarek, Baker, Tessa, Chase and Weston. He is a talented musician, and proficient in the guitar, the mandolin, the banjo, and the ukulele.\n\nIn July 2014, Krukow revealed he was suffering from inclusion body myositis (IBM). His condition was known to the Giants and many of his fellow broadcasters, but he kept the condition a secret from the general public until then. Krukow first noticed that he was having problems about 10 years earlier, when he had lost about 100 yards (90 m) off his golf drive. According to sportswriter Steve Fainaru, Krukow \"blew it off... for years\", but \"secretly feared he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease\". Finally, in 2011, he saw the Giants' team neurologist, who referred him to a neuromuscular specialist who in turn diagnosed him with IBM. The disease, which mainly affects the quadriceps and hand muscles, is not life-threatening, but now requires him to use a cane; eventually, Krukow will have to use a walker and/or a scooter. Because of increasing hand weakness that limits his ability to play stringed instruments, he has recently taken up the drums, which require a different set of muscular movements. Krukow plans to continue broadcasting for the foreseeable future, but in 2017, he announced that he would reduce his schedule to 120 games a season, only working road games west of Denver, except for postseason games.\n\nFor the 2020 season, NBC Sports Bay Area announced that it would experiment with having Krukow commentate from the network's San Francisco studio rather than on-site (promoted as \"SplitKast\") for 22 NL West road games, rather than on-site.\n\n"}
{"id": "2117346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117346", "title": "Missingsch", "text": "Missingsch\n\nA more technical definition of is that it is a type of contact variety, specifically a type of German variety with a Low German (or Low Saxon) substratum. This is the result of linguistic, cultural, educational and political Germanisation of the region that is now Northern Germany. This process of Germanisation began in earnest in the late seventeenth century, after the demise of the Hanseatic League and thus the erosion of its Middle-Saxon-speaking power. Pressures to adopt German and at the same time being held back by insufficient access to formal (by now solely German language) education in the lower social classes led to various stages of transition from Low German to High German. These generally low-prestige language varieties continued to be spoken (rarely written) until the late 20th century, though some people still continue and promote them now, very often for their supposed entertainment value, typically in comical veins.\n\nPerhaps the best-known remaining domain of is that of \" jokes\" — usually told entirely in  — in which laconic humour glorifies low-class wit and comments on working class conditions; e.g.\n\nFrom a linguistic point of view, varieties did not become extinct as such. They merely developed into more \"cleaned-up\" northern varieties of German, varieties that use numerous elements, especially in their casual registers. As such, has been influencing the development of Standard German, mostly indirectly by way of northern German dialect contributions. Obvious examples are Low Saxon loanwords such as 'bye' (compare Low Saxon: , ). However, most influences are not as clearly noticeable as they involve lexical and idiomatic choices. A case of lexical choice is (compare Low Saxon and Standard German , ) 'Saturday'.\n\nThere are numerous parallel cases to that of . These are found in many situations in which languages came to be supplanted by other languages. Within a Northern European context there is the case of in the northern parts of the Netherlands and the case of sociolects of Scottish English that have particularly strong Scots characteristics.\n\nWhile there have been many varieties of throughout Northern Germany, those of larger cities are best known, such as those of Hamburg, , Bremen, Flensburg and Danzig.\n\nThe name refers to the city of (), which lies outside the traditional Saxon-speaking region (although the state in which it is situated at one time acquired the misleading name \"Saxony\", originally the name of what is now Northern Germany). 's Central German dialect was considered exemplary and was highly influential between the fifteenth century and the establishment of Modern Standard German. The name is the Low Saxon equivalent of what in German is , rather than, as often stated, derived from the German name .\n\nTraditional German varieties of Berlin qualify as as well, though few people today think of as a Missingsch variety. Berlin is still surrounded by traditionally Low-German-speaking areas of the southeastern or Brandenburg type. Before it became the center of the Prussian state, Berlin, too, was Low-German-speaking. As such it adopted German earlier than did other northern centers. Typical is thus technically a Missingsch group with an additional Western Slavic (probably Old Lower Sorbian) substratum, since before Saxon and Low Franconian colonisation the area was Slavic-speaking.\n\nIn his novel (\"Gripsholm Castle\"), Kurt Tucholsky broaches the issue of and provides samples.\n\n\n\nMany of the above-mentioned words are used in casual-style Northern German dialects that descended from Missingsch at least in part.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117374", "title": "Durupınar site", "text": "Durupınar site\n\nThe Durupınar site is a large aggregate structure on Mount Tendürek in eastern Turkey. The site is 3 kilometres (2 mi) north of the Iranian border, 16 km (10 mi) southeast of Doğubeyazıt, in the Ağrı Province, and 29 km (18 miles) south of the Greater Mount Ararat summit, at an elevation of 1,966 to 2,004 m (6,449 to 6,575 ft) above sea level.\n\nThe size and shape of the structure has led to its promotion by some believers as the original Noah's Ark, but geologists as well as some creationists argue that it is a natural formation. The site is near several officially-unnamed peaks, though locals call one of the nearby peaks \"Cudi Dağı\" in Turkish and \"Çîyaye Cûdî\" in Kurdish, which David Fasold linked to Mount Judi ( \"\"), the mountain named in the Quran as the final resting place of Noah's Ark. Some researchers place Mount Judi in another location farther south near the Turkish/Iraqi border.\n\nAccording to local reports, heavy rains combined with three earthquakes exposed the formation from the surrounding mud on May 19, 1948. It was discovered by a Kurdish shepherd named Reshit Sarihan. It was subsequently identified by Turkish Army Captain İlhan Durupınar — for whom it was subsequently named — in a Turkish Air Force aerial photo while on a mapping mission for NATO in October 1959. Durupınar informed the Turkish government of his discovery and a group from the Archeological Research Foundation which included George Vandeman, İlhan Durupınar, and Arthur Brandenberger, professor of photogrammetry, surveyed the site in September 1960. After two days of digging and dynamiting inside the \"boat-shaped\" formation, the expedition members found only soil and rocks. Their official news release concluded that \"there were no visible archaeological remains\" and that this formation \"was a freak of nature and not man-made\".\nThe site was then ignored until 1977, when it was rediscovered and promoted by self-styled archaeologist and amateur explorer Ron Wyatt. Throughout the 1980s, Wyatt repeatedly tried to interest other people in the site, including ark hunter and former astronaut James Irwin and creationist John D. Morris, neither of whom was convinced the structure was the Ark.\n\nIn 1985, Wyatt was joined by David Fasold and geophysicist John Baumgardner for the expedition recounted in Fasold's \"The Ark of Noah\". As soon as Fasold saw the site, he exclaimed that it was a shipwreck. Fasold brought along state-of-the-art ground-penetrating radar equipment and a \"frequency generator\", set it on the wavelength for iron, and searched the formation for internal iron loci (the latter technique was later compared to dowsing by the site's detractors). Fasold and the team states that the ground penetration radar revealed a regular internal structure and measured the length of the formation as , close to the 300 cubits (157 m, 515 ft) of the Noah's Ark in the Bible if the Ancient Egyptian cubit of 20.6 inches (0.52 m) is used. Fasold believed the team found the fossilized remains of the upper deck and that the original reed substructure had disappeared. In the nearby village of Kazan (formerly Arzap), they examined so-called drogue (anchor) stones that they believed were once attached to the ark.\n\nCreationist commentators, such as Andrew Snelling in the Creation Ministries International journal \"Creation\", wrote that \"there are no scientific principles employed\" in the \"so-called frequency generator\" used by Wyatt's team. He called it a \"gadget, which is generally advertised in treasure-hunting magazines, not scientific journals\" with \"brass welding rods being used in essence, as divining rods, similar to the use of a forked stick to search for water.\"\n\nFasold asserted in his 1988 book that locals call one of the peaks near to the Durupinar site al Cudi (Turkish \"Cudi Dagi\", Kurdish \"Çîyaye Cûdî\") and linked this to the Mount Judi named in the Quran as the final resting place of Noah's Ark. The assertion is controversial and not well supported by local toponymy.\n\nAfter a few expeditions to the Durupınar site that included drilling and excavation in the 1990s, Fasold began to have doubts that the Durupınar formation was Noah's ark. He visited the site in September 1994 with Australian geologist Ian Plimer and concluded that the structure was not a boat. He surmised that ancient peoples had erroneously believed the site was the ark. In 1996, Fasold co-wrote a paper with geologist Lorence Collins titled \"Bogus 'Noah's Ark' from Turkey Exposed as a Common Geologic Structure\", which concluded that the boat-shaped formation was a natural stone formation that merely resembled a boat. The same paper pointed out that the \"anchors\" were local volcanic stone. The abstract reads:\nA natural rock structure near Dogubayazit, Turkey, has been misidentified as Noah's Ark. Microscopic studies of a supposed iron bracket show that it is derived from weathered volcanic minerals. Supposed metal-braced walls are natural concentrations of limonite and magnetite in steeply inclined sedimentary layers in the limbs of a doubly plunging syncline. Supposed fossilized gopherwood bark is crinkled metamorphosed peridotite. Fossiliferous limestone, interpreted as cross cutting the syncline, preclude the structure from being Noah's Ark because these supposed \"Flood\" deposits are younger than the \"Ark.\" Anchor stones at Kazan (Arzap) are derived from local andesite and not from Mesopotamia. \n\nIn April 1997, in sworn testimony at an Australian court case, Fasold repeated his doubts and noted that he regarded the claim that Noah's ark had been found as \"absolute BS\".\n\nOthers, such as fellow ark researcher David Allen Deal, reported that before his death, Fasold returned to a belief that the Durupınar site might be the location of the ark. His close Australian friend and biographer June Dawes wrote:\nHe [Fasold] kept repeating that no matter what the experts said, there was too much going for the [Durupınar] site for it to be dismissed. He remained convinced it was the fossilized remains of Noah's Ark.\n\nThe Arzap drogue stones are a number of large standing stones found near the Durupınar site by amateur archaeologist Ron Wyatt with the aid of David Fasold and others. Fasold interpreted the artifacts as drogues, stone weights used to stabilize the Ark in rough seas, because they all have a chamfered hole cut at one end as if to fasten a rope to them, and his reading of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Babylonian mythical account of the flood, suggested to him that such stones were used.\n\nDrogue stones were the equivalent of a storm anchor on ancient ships. They have been found in the Nile and elsewhere in the Mediterranean area, and like the stones found by Wyatt and Fasold, they are heavy and flat with a hole for tying a line at one end. Their purpose was to create drag in the water or along shallow sandy bottoms: the stone was attached to one end of a boat, and the drag produced would cause the bow or stern to face into the wind and wind-blown waves.\n\nA geological investigation of samples from the stones, published by geologist Lorence Collins in co-authorship with their original discoverer David Fasold, found that they are of local rock and thus could not have been brought from Mesopotamia, the Ark's supposed place of origin. Similar stones found throughout ancient Armenia are recognised as pagan \"holy stones\" converted to Christian use by the addition of crosses and other Christian symbols. Many are found in Christian cemeteries, as these were.\n\n\n\n"}

The university offers more than 45 undergraduate programs of study and six graduate programs. A number of these programs are available for online learning.\n\nMount Mercy University's 40-acre campus is located in a tree-lined residential neighborhood in the heart of Cedar Rapids, Iowa (population 126,326). The Our Mother of Sorrows Grotto is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nMount Mercy University was founded as a two-year college for women in 1928 by the Sisters of Mercy of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. These sisters, whose order was founded in 1831 by Catherine McAuley in Dublin, Ireland, have been active in Cedar Rapids since 1875. The college was an outgrowth of their concerns about the education of women.\n\nIn 1957, Mount Mercy became a four-year institution and awarded its first bachelor's degree in 1959. The college received accreditation as a baccalaureate institution by the North Central Association in 1960. In 1968 the Sisters of Mercy transferred their legal authority and responsibility to a self-perpetuating independent board of which three members would always be Sisters of Mercy. Mount Mercy College became coeducational in 1969. While integrating a strong liberal arts component, the college has always emphasized professional development from its early involvement, as a junior college, on business courses and teacher education. The departments of nursing, education, and social work were accredited in the 1960s and 1970s as the four-year programs developed. Begun in 1997, the Adult Accelerated program, a joint Mount Mercy University/Kirkwood Community College accelerated degree completion program for working adults meets an important community workforce development need.\n\nOn August 23, 2010, the institution was re-designated as a university.\n\n\nMount Mercy is sponsored by the Institute of the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas, through the Conference for Mercy Higher Education. \nThe Campus Ministry team supports students’ faith development and spiritual life through daily mass, retreats, service-learning opportunities, and vocation discernment activities.\n\nMount Mercy offers more than 85 areas of study, organized into eight academic departments - serving traditional residential, transfer, and working adult students.\n\n\n\n\nMount Mercy teams are known as the Mustangs.

{"id": "2117403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117403", "title": "Division of Kalgoorlie", "text": "Division of Kalgoorlie\n\nThe Division of Kalgoorlie was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Western Australia, named after the city of Kalgoorlie. The Division was proclaimed in 1900 as one of the original 75 divisions to be contested at the first Federal election. In its final form, it covered most of the land area of Western Australia, with a size of —over 90 percent of the state's landmass (an area the size of France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland and Great Britain combined). It included the Goldfields-Esperance, Gascoyne, Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia, in addition to the eastern and far northern parts of the Mid West region, and the town of Merredin. It was the largest single-member electorate by area in the world—almost a third of the continent.\n\nFor most of its history, Kalgoorlie was split between strongly pro-Labor territory in the mining regions and more conservative-leaning farming areas, and from 1980s Labor also benefited from the support of indigenous voters in the northern parts of the electorate. Unlike seats in the eastern states with similar demographics, it was not usually reckoned as a bellwether for winning government—primarily because most elections have already been decided by the time the first returns come in from the state. The Liberals (and their predecessors) and Labor alternated for long spells in the seat. As evidence of how little it was affected by trends in the rest of the country, all but one of its members from 1922 onward spent at least one term in opposition.\n\nFor most of the time from 1922 to 1995, the conservative farming areas were usually swamped by Labor support in mining towns. Labor lost the electorate only when its support in Western Australia collapsed, such as in the late 1970s due to the regional backlash against the Whitlam government. In 1995, however, sitting Labor MP Graeme Campbell was expelled from the party. He retained the electorate at the 1996 election but in 1998 was defeated by Liberal Barry Haase, who held the seat until its abolition despite vigorous challenges from Labor. Haase benefited from the popularity of the Liberal Party in Western Australia during this period, as well as a sharp decline in Labor support in the city of Kalgoorlie, previously a Labor stronghold for the better part of a century. When Haase was reelected in 2007, it was the only time that Labor had won government at an election without winning Kalgoorlie.\n\nThe division was abolished at the 2008 redistribution, effective from the 2010 federal election. Due to a drop in population, Kalgoorlie needed to increase in size. However, all of the proposed maps would have made it all but impossible to draw O'Connor, the other large country seat in Western Australia, in a way that it would have any rational basis. Ultimately, the Australian Electoral Commission decided to abolish Kalgoorlie. Most of the northern portion of its territory was transferred to the new Division of Durack, while the southern portion (including the city of Kalgoorlie) was absorbed into O'Connor. Haase transferred to Durack. Upon the abolition of Kalgoorlie, the title of largest single member electoral constituency in the world passed to Nunavut in Canada.\n\nNone of its members got to retire at the time of their choosing as they lost the seat in an election, lost party preselection, died in office, expelled (Hugh Mahon) and when the seat was abolished it necessitated its last member Barry Haase to move to the seat of Durack.\n\n"}

It was adopted in 1874, shortly after the Brooks-Baxter War. It replaced the 1868 constitution adopted by the legislature following the end of the American Civil War and under which Arkansas rejoined the Union.\n\nThe Brooks-Baxter War and passage of the new constitution are considered to mark the end of Reconstruction in Arkansas. This was two years before the disputed 1876 presidential election and national compromise that resulted in the Republican government withdrawing federal troops from the South. The state has passed numerous amendments to the constitution – 94 as of October 2015.\n\nBy gaining passage of the Election Law of 1891 and a poll tax amendment in the general election of 1892, the Democratic Party consolidated its control of state politics over Republicans and a farmer-labor coalition; it also effectively disenfranchised most African Americans. By 1895 no African Americans were left in the state house; their exclusion from politics lasted for decades deep into the 20th century.\n\nIn 1833, the Territory of Arkansas was eager to be admitted as a state, although Congress was hesitant to admit another pro-slavery state due to the tense equality achieved under the Missouri Compromise. The territory elected delegates for a state constitutional convention. Territorial governor, William Fulton tried to halt the convention, but Attorney General, Benjamin F. Butler ruled the assemblage legal. The first state constitution was ratified by Congress on January 30, 1836, and on June 15 of that year, President Andrew Jackson signed the act making Arkansas the 25th state.\n\nThe first constitution was vague and short. It was replaced by the second Arkansas state constitution when Arkansas seceded from the Union on May 6, 1861. This constitution was very similar to the original except for its references to The Confederate States of America.\n\nArkansas adopted a new Constitution on March 18, 1864, after the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. This constitution stipulated that federal recognition and support would resume after ten percent of 1860 voters took the oath of allegiance to the union. Slavery was abolished in this constitution, but there was no provision as to civil rights for freedmen, or former slaves. This constitution was passed in an effort to complete Reconstruction and return power to local governments as quickly as possible. This was the first constitution to define election procedures for a number of important posts within the state government.\n\nCongress's 1867 Reconstruction Acts followed passage of the 13th and 14th Amendments emancipating slaves and making them citizens. The 1867 Acts required former Confederate states to recognize former slaves as citizens, and to adopt constitutions providing suffrage for freedmen.\n\nIn late 1867 Arkansas elected delegates to a new Constitutional Convention, which took place in early 1868 in the old capital building in Little Rock. At that Convention, the delegates drafted a new Constitution. It was adopted by popular referendum in the spring of 1868. That June Arkansas became the first rebel state to be readmitted to the Union under the Reconstruction Acts. The Constitution of 1868 made racial discrimination illegal; provided suffrage (voting) rights for freedmen age 21 and older; provided for public schools for the first time, for both black and white children; and it established a state university.\n\nThe fifth and current constitution was adopted in 1874. Democrats regained control of the state legislature for the first time since the Civil War. They spent a summer re-writing the constitution.\n\nThis version reflects attitudes related to the war and its aftermath. The delegates gave the most power to county governments, including for legal issues, transportation, taxation and spending. The power of the governor was significantly curtailed. State officials' terms were dropped from four years to two years, and more state positions were required to be filled by popular election, rather than appointment by the governor. This is the constitution that the state uses today, with some 87 amendments and various other changes.\n\nArkansas held constitutional conventions in 1918, 1969, and 1979, called the Sixth, Seventh, and Eight Constitutional Conventions, respectively. None of these drafts were ratified. Arkansas has passed numerous amendments - 90 at last count.\n\nWe, the People of the State of Arkansas, grateful to Almighty God for the privilege of choosing our own form of government; for our civil and religious liberty; and desiring to perpetuate its blessings, and secure the same to our selves and posterity; do ordain and establish this Constitution.\n\nThis article establishes the boundaries of Arkansas as running from the Mississippi river on the east to the Oklahoma and Texas borders on the west, and bound by Missouri in the north and Louisiana in the south. This article also defines the seat of government as being in Little Rock.\n\nFor the most part, this article affirms the same limits to the State Government that are similarly constrained by the US Constitution to the Government of the United States.\n\nOne interesting note, Section 26 states that no religious test shall be applied as a requirement to vote or hold office, yet later on in the constitution Atheists are expressly forbidden from holding office.\n\nArticle 3 mandates that all elections shall be fair and equal. No person shall be denied the right to vote. Any resident citizen over the age of 18 may register and vote. Electors are exempt from arrest while they are traveling to and from elections. Soldiers may not vote on the basis of being stationed in Arkansas, they must establish residency through other means.\n\nThis article states that there will be 3 branches of government, legislative, judicial, and executive.\n\nArticle 5 provides for the operations of the Arkansas General Assembly. It requires the Assembly to meet biennially (Section 5) and limits these meetings to 60 days unless otherwise approved by two-thirds of both houses (Section 17). Section 4 sets the qualifications for members. Amendment 86 allows for biennial fiscal sessions in even-numbered years; these sessions are limited to legislative deliberation regarding the state budget, though other issues may be brought before the houses via approval of a two-thirds vote of the membership.\n\nSection 1 allows for passage of laws or constitutional amendments by initiative. Petitions require signatures equal to eight percent of registered voters to appear on the ballot for a law, or ten percent for a constitutional amendment (see below). Section 1 also allows, by six percent of voters placing a petition, for a statewide referendum on any law or any part of a law. The petition must be filed no later than 90 days after final adjournment of the Assembly. The law is suspended until it is voted on in the next election; if part of a law, the portion subject to referendum is suspended while all other provisions remain in effect.\n\nIt also includes highly restrictive provisions regarding appropriations:\n\nAn example of how the restrictions can wreak havoc took place in 1989, when the general appropriations bill (which far exceeded $2.5 million) failed to gain the required three-fourths majority, but was \"declared passed\" by the General Assembly under the \"just debts of the State\" exemption, and all subsequent special appropriations bills were passed thereafter. However, the Arkansas Supreme Court disagreed with the Assembly's use of the just debts provision. As a result, it declared every single appropriations bill of the session unconstitutional—the general bill did not receive the votes needed to pass under Section 39, and under Section 40 all other appropriations bills were invalid since the general bill must be passed first—requiring the Assembly to return in special session to reenact them.\n\nAppropriations do not constitute the state budget in Arkansas; that is enacted near the end of the session, when the Revenue Stabilization Law, which provides the mechanism for distributing the state's revenue (even general revenues), is amended to reflect the submitted budget. Any appropriation not funded by the Revenue Stabilization Law is essentially null and void. Some observers believe that the Revenue Stabilization Act, while strict in its implementation, has prevented the state from suffering the financial difficulties of other states with less-strict preventive measures to avoid deficit spending.\n\nArticle 19 Section 1, titled \"Atheists disqualified from holding office or testifying as witness\", states: \"No person who denies the being of a God shall hold any office in the civil departments of this State, nor be competent to testify as a witness in any court.\"\n\nClassified as a religious test, there are no known cases of this article being enforced in modern times, as religious freedom is provided for in the United States Constitution's Bill of Rights. In addition, Article Six of the United States Constitution is considered to prohibit such religious tests. It says: \"no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\" Current legal precedent holds that this provision is binding on the states as well under the liberty clause of the 14th Amendment to the federal constitution. Additionally, the First Amendment to the federal constitution establishes freedom of religion as a constitutional right. While the wording of this amendment specifically bars Congress from restricting freedom of religion, current precedent holds that this amendment and the rest of the United States Bill of Rights are binding on the states by the liberty clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nIn addition to the 20 Articles listed above, numerous amendments (94 as of October 2015, per the link below) have been added. Though some amendments have been physically incorporated into the text of the Constitution (e.g. Amendment 1, adding Article 20 and Amendment 90, incorporated changes made to Amendment 82), others remain physically separate from the text.\n\nNotable amendments shown separately include:\n\n\nThe current Constitution allows for two methods of amendment. However, each method is shown in a separate section.\n\nUnder Section 22 of Article 19, either house of the General Assembly may propose amendments. The amendment requires majority approval of both houses in a recorded vote, publication in at least one newspaper in each county for six months prior to the next election of the Assembly, and majority approval of the voters.\n\nHowever, the Section places further restrictions on legislative amendments, requiring each amendment to appear separately on the ballot and limiting the number per ballot to three.\n\nUnder Section 1 of Article 5 (as amended by Amendment 7), ten percent of legal voters may propose an amendment by initiative, requiring majority approval of the voters. The proposed amendment must be filed with the Arkansas Secretary of State not less than four months before the election, and 30 days prior to the election the petitioners (at their own expense) must publish the amendment \"in some paper of general circulation\". Unlike legislative amendments, there are no limits on the number of amendments by initiative that may be proposed on any one ballot.\n\nSection 13 originally set the state's usury limit at 10%; it was amended in the early 1980s to 5% above the Federal Reserve Discount Rate on 90-day commercial paper (see the latest rates), but falling interest rates and poorly worded provisions made the amended version more onerous than the original. For example, a clause in the 1980s amendment appears to set a 17% limit for consumer loans; but since they were not exempted from the main \"5% above discount rate\" provision, the courts ruled that the limit for consumer loans was the \"lesser\" of the two clauses, usually the 5% rule. Also, other language in the amendment applying the usury limit \"at the time of the contract\" made floating-rate loans extremely difficult, even though the usury limit was a floating rate. Neither the original nor amended provisions allowed the legislature to make any exceptions to the general usury law, as happened in other states. The Arkansas legislature tried to permit payday loans anyway, but after two adverse decisions in 2008, the Attorney General ordered all payday lenders in the state to shut down.\n\nAfter out-of-state banks took over most lending in Arkansas, banks located in the state received special relief from the usury law through Section 731 of the Federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999. Also in that year, an Arkansas Supreme Court decision allowed out-of-state auto finance companies to engage in subprime lending through Arkansas dealerships without violating the usury law. Today, only a handful of loans made to Arkansans are still subject to this law, mainly private-party lending and some prime auto loans from companies such as GMAC and Ford Credit.\n\nThis unique and unusual article (added by Amendment 1) prohibits the General Assembly from making appropriations for payment of principal and interest on several bond issues from 1869 to 1871, commonly referred to as Holford bonds. They were passed during Reconstruction by the General Assembly. Some of the bonds refinanced disputed debt outstanding from shortly after Arkansas' statehood in 1836. These bonds had been central to the Brooks-Baxter War.\n\n"}
{"id": "2117431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117431", "title": "Migration Period art", "text": "Migration Period art\n\nMigration Period art denotes the artwork of the Germanic peoples during the Migration period (c. 300 – 900). It includes the Migration art of the Germanic tribes on the continent, as well the start of the Insular art or Hiberno-Saxon art of the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic fusion in the British Isles. It covers many different styles of art including the polychrome style and the animal style. After Christianization, Migration Period art developed into various schools of Early Medieval art in Western Europe which are normally classified by region, such as Anglo-Saxon art and Carolingian art, before the continent-wide styles of Romanesque art and finally Gothic art developed.\n\nIn the 3rd century, the Roman Empire almost collapsed and its army was becoming increasingly Germanic in make-up, so that in the 4th century when Huns pushed German tribes westward, they spilled across the Empire's borders and began to settle there. The Visigoths settled in Italy and then Spain, in the north the Franks settled into Gaul and western Germany, and in the 5th century the Angles, Saxons and Jutes invaded Britain. By the close of the 6th century the Western Roman Empire was almost completely replaced with smaller less politically organized, but vigorous, Germanic kingdoms.\n\nAlthough these kingdoms were never homogeneous, they shared certain common cultural features. They settled in their new lands and became farmers and fishermen. Archaeological evidence shows no tradition of monumental artwork, such as architecture or large sculpture in permanent materials, but a preference instead for \"mobile\" art for personal display, usually also with a practical function, such as weapons, horse harness, tools, and jewelry which fastened clothes. The surviving art of the Germanic peoples is almost entirely personal adornment, portable, and before conversion to Christianity was buried with its owner. Much art in organic materials has no doubt not survived.\n\nThree styles dominate Germanic art. The \"polychrome style\" originated with the Goths who had settled in the Black Sea area. The \"animal style\" was found in Scandinavia, north Germany and England. Finally there was Insular art or the \"Hiberno-Saxon style\", a brief but prosperous period after Christianization that saw the fusion of animal style, Celtic, Mediterranean and other motifs and techniques.\n\nDuring the 2nd century the Goths of southern Russia discovered a newfound taste for gold figurines and objects inlaid with precious stones. This style was borrowed from Scythians and the Sarmatians, had some Greco-Roman influences, and was also popular with the Huns. Perhaps the most famous examples are found in the fourth-century Pietroasele treasure (Romania), which includes a great gold eagle brooch (picture). The eagle motif derives from East Asia and results from the participation of the forebears of the Goths in the Hunnic Empire, as in the fourth-century Gothic polychrome eagle-head belt buckle (picture) from South Russia.\n\nThe Goths carried this style to Italy, southern France and Spain. One well known example is the Ostrogothic eagle (fibula) from Cesena, Italy, now at the museum in Nuremberg. Another is the Visigothic polychrome votive crown (picture) of Recceswinth, King of Toledo, found in a votive crown hoard of c. 670 at Fuente de Guarrazar, near Toledo. The popularity of the style can be attested to by the discovery of a polychrome sword (picture) in the tomb of Frankish king Childeric I (died \"ca\" 481), well north of the Alps.\n\nThe study of Northern European, or \"Germanic\", zoomorphic decoration was pioneered by Bernhard Salin in a work published in 1904. He classified animal art of the period roughly from 400 to 900 into three phases: Styles I, II and III. The origins of these different phases are still the subject of considerable debate; the development of trends in late-Roman popular art in the provinces is one element, and the older traditions of nomadic Asiatic steppe peoples another. The first two styles are found very widely across Europe in the art of the \"barbarian\" peoples of the Migration Period.\n\nStyle I. First appears in northwest Europe, it became a noticeable new style with the introduction of the chip carving technique applied to bronze and silver in the 5th century. It is characterized by animals whose bodies are divided into sections, and typically appear at the fringes of designs whose main emphasis is on abstract patterns.\n\nStyle II. After about 560-570 Style I was in decline and Salin's Style II began to replace it. Style II's animals are whole beasts, but their bodies are elongated into \"ribbons\" which intertwined into symmetrical shapes with no pretence of naturalism, and rarely any legs, so that they tend to be described as serpents, although the heads often have characteristics of other types of animal. The animal becomes subsumed into ornamental patterns, typically using interlace. Thus two bears are facing each other in perfect symmetry (\"confronted\"), forming the shape of a heart. Examples of Style II can be found on the gold purse lid.\n\nAfter about 700 localised styles develop, and it is no longer very useful to talk of a general Germanic style. Salin Style III is found mainly in Scandinavia, and may also be called Viking art.\n\nByzantine enameling highly influenced Migration period metalwork. The Church in the early Migration period emerged as the only supranational force in Europe after the collapse of the Roman Empire. It provided a unifying element and was the only institution left that could preserve selected rudiments of classical civilization. As the conversion of Germanic peoples by the end of the 7th centuries in western Europe neared completion, the church became the prime patron for art, commissioning illuminated manuscripts and other liturgical objects. The record shows a steady decline in Germanic forms and increasing Mediterranean influence. This process occurred quickly with the Goths of Italy and Spain and more slowly the further north one looked. This change can be observed in the 8th century Merovingian codex Gelasian Sacramentary, it contained no Style II elements, instead showing Mediterranean examples of fish used to construct large letters at the start of chapters.\n\nInsular art, often also known as Hiberno-Saxon art, especially in relation to illuminated manuscripts) was confined to Great Britain and Ireland and was the fusion of Germanic traditions (via the Anglo-Saxons) with Celtic traditions (via Irish monks). It can first be seen in the late 7th century and the style would continue in Britain for about 150 years until the Viking invasions of the 9th century (after which we see the emergence of Anglo-Saxon art), and in Ireland up until the 12th century (after which see Romanesque art).\n\nIreland was converted to Christianity by missions from Britain and the continent, beginning in the mid-fifth century, while simultaneously pagan Angles, Saxons and Jutes were settling in England. The extreme political fragmentation of Ireland and its total lack of urban development prevented the emergence of a strong episcopal structure. Monasticism consequently emerged as the dominant force in Irish Christianity, and thus in Irish Christian art.\n\nCeltic Christianity also developed a strong emphasis on missionary activity. Around 563 Saint Columba founded a base on the Scottish island of Iona, from which to convert Pictish pagans in Scotland; this monastic settlement became long remained a key centre of Christian culture in northern Britain. Columban monks then went to Northumbria in 635 and founded a monastery on the island of Lindisfarne, from which to convert the north of England. However Rome had already begun the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons from the south with a mission to Kent in 597. Conflict arose between the Irish monks and Rome on the date to celebrate Easter, leading to withdrawal of the Irish mission from Lindisfarne to Iona. However, the widespread use of Irish decorative forms in art produced in England, and vice versa, attests to the continuing importance of interaction between the two cultures. England would come under increasing Mediterranean influence, but not before Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon art had profitably fused.\n\nThe first major work that can be called purely Hiberno-Saxon is the Book of Durrow in the late 7th century. There followed a golden age in metalworking, manuscripts and stone sculpture. In the 9th century the heyday of the Hiberno-Saxon style neared its end, with the disruptions of Viking raids and the increasing dominance of Mediterranean forms (see Anglo-Saxon art).\n\nThe surviving evidence of Irish Celtic art from the Iron Age period is dominated by metalwork in a La Tène style. Hanging bowls such as those found at Sutton Hoo are among some of the most important of these crafts. As Irish missionaries began to spread the word of the Gospels they needed books, and almost from the start, they began to embellish their texts with artwork drawing from the designs of these metalworking traditions. The spirals and scrolls in the enlarged opening letters—found in the earliest manuscripts such as the 7th century Cathach of St. Columba manuscript—borrows in style directly from Celtic enamels and La Tène metalworking motifs.\n\nAfter the Cathach of St. Columba, book decoration became increasingly more complex and new styles from other cultures were introduced. Carpet pages—entire pages of ornamentation with no text—were inserted, usually at the start of each Gospel. The geometric motifs and interlaced patterns may have been influences from Coptic Egypt or elsewhere in the Byzantine Middle East. The increasing use of animal ornamentation was an Anglo-Saxon contribution of its animal style. All of these influences and traditions combined into what could be called a new Hiberno-Saxon style, with the Book of Durrow in the later 7th century being the first of its type. The Lindisfarne Gospels is another famous example.\n\nThe Book of Kells was probably created in Iona in the 8th century. When the monks fled to Ireland in the face of Viking raids in 807, they probably brought it with them to Kells in Ireland. It is the most richly decorated of the Hiberno-Saxon manuscripts and represents a large array of techniques and motifs created during the 8th century.\n\nIn the 7th century there emerged a resurgence of metalworking with new techniques such as gold filigree that allowed ever smaller and more detailed ornamentations, especially on the penannular and pseudo-penannular Celtic brooches that were important symbols of status for the elite, and also worn by clergy as part of their vestments. The Tara Brooch and Ardagh Hoard are among the most magnificent Insular examples, whilst the 7th century royal jewellery from the Sutton Hoo ship burial shows a Pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon style. They brought together all of the available skills of the goldsmith in one piece: ornamentation applied to a variety of techniques and materials, chip carving, filigree, cloisonné and rock crystal.\n\nThe skills displayed in metalworking can be seen in stone sculptures. For many centuries it had been Irish custom to display a large wooden cross inside the monastic building enclosure. These were then translated into stone crosses called high crosses and covered with the same intricate patterns used by goldsmiths, and often figure sculptures.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117432", "title": "Dromahair", "text": "Dromahair\n\nDromahair () is a village in County Leitrim, Ireland. Dromahair is 10 km (6 mi) from Manorhamilton and 17 km (10 mi) from Sligo town.\n\nDromahair lies in the hilly north west of Leitrim amid some stunning unspoiled natural landscapes. The \"Sleeping Giant\" mountain formation (comprising Keelogyboy, Leean and Benbo) is visible on approaches to the village, as is Lough Gill below the Slieve Daeáne and Killerry mountain. The village itself is also idyllic, located on the banks of the River Bonet, which flows into Lough Gill. Much of Dromahair was modelled on a village in Somerset by the Earl of Leitrim, and the central streetscape still follows the pattern set down by him.\n\nThe village takes its name from the ridge of high ground on which it is located above the Bonnet river. The ridge was the site of the important early church site of Drumlease, a Patrician foundation of the fifth century AD. The name in Irish is Droim dhá Ethiar, meaning apparently the \"Ridge of Two (Air) Demons\".\n\nDuring the medieval period Dromahair was the capital of Breifne - a Gaelic confederation that stretched from Kells in County Meath across County Cavan and north County Leitrim to County Sligo. It was the seat of the O'Rourkes - the ancient Kings of Brieifne. The ruins of the O'Rourke castle (built c. 950 AD) and banqueting hall are present in the village. On the ruins of this ancient site now fourteen holiday cottages have been built.\nIt is also the place from which Devorgilla (wife of Tiernan O'Rourke) was abducted by Dermot McMurrough (the King of Leinster) in 1153 to Ferns, an act which brought about a feud and McMurrough's eventual exile from Ireland.\nCreevelea Abbey, located on the outskirts of the village, is a Franciscan Friary which was founded in 1508 and was in use until the 17th century when the Franciscans were forced to leave by the Cromwellian army. The nave, choir, tower and transept are well preserved and it is now protected as a national monument. In addition, a fortified house constructed for Sir William Villiers (c. 1629) is located in the village. In 1798 General Humbert led Irish and French forces to defeat the British at battles in Castlebar and at Carricknagat near Collooney. Humbert's forces were then pursued through Leitrim to Longford. His army is known to have rested in Dromahair and captured British artillery was thrown into the Bonet to allow faster movement of the army.\n\nDromahair was connected to the railway network until the late 1950s. The railway station opened on 1 September 1881 as part of the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway connecting Sligo and Enniskillen. It finally closed on the 1 October 1957 with the closure of the line.\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats used to visit the town regularly to meet the parish priest. He refers to that priest in his poem \"The old priest Peter Gilligan\" and to Dromahair in \"\"The man who dreamed of Faeryland\"\":\n\n<div>Before earth took him to her stony care...\nThe historic Abbey Manor hotel, refurbished and re-opened in 2004 by Charlie McCreevy, the then finance minister, was abruptly closed in 2009 and abandoned to the elements. The owners went into hiding and attempts by various concerned groups and individuals to track them down have so far (2015) proved unsuccessful. The building has been subject to vandalism and theft since its closure, the lead has been removed from the roof, and the valuable paintings stolen. After an attempt was made to burn the building down a Section 59 notice (notice to require works to be carried out by the owners) was put into effect on the hotel in July 2015.\n\nThrough at least the 19th and 20th centurys, four annual fairs were held at Dromahair on- January 1, June 15, July 21, and October 31 (or November 1).\n\nDromahair has several pubs and restaurants. It also contains a post office, hotel and public library, a few convenience stores and general shops, hairdressers, butchers, garage, national school, two historic churches (Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland) as well as a health centre. Tourist attractions include Creevelea Abbey, the Tour De Humbert Cycling Trail (which passes through the village), Ard Nahoo Health Farm, Parke's Castle situated beside Lough Gill on the Sligo-Dromahair road (R286, 5 km (3 mi) NW of the village) and the Wild Rose Waterbus which offers tours of Lough Gill between Sligo and Parke's Castle.\n\nDromahair has both men's and ladies' GAA clubs. In 2009, the men's club competed in RTÉ's \"Celebrity Bainisteoir\" competition under comedian Katherine Lynch, getting to the final of the competition.\n\nThe R287 road links Dromahair west to Sligo town and Collooney, or east to Manorhamilton via the R280. The R288 is an alternative route to Sligo, north of Lough Gill via the R286.\n\nBus Éireann routes serving Dromahair include the 462, 469 and 470 which link with Sligo, Drumkeeran, Manorhamilton, Carrick on Shannon and Longford. The nearest station is Sligo railway station.\n\nDrumlease National School is approximately two miles from Lough Gill. The school is under the patronage of the Catholic Bishop of Kilmore, and it underwent a Whole School Evaluation by the inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills in 2013. The Old \"Drumlease National School\" in the townland of the same name was found to be unsuitable for the children of Dromahair by Rev. Cormac McSharry and it was replaced by him in 1901. In 1959, a Western plot was approved as an extension to the school site, which was opened in 1969.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117434", "title": "Constitution of Florida", "text": "Constitution of Florida\n\nThe Constitution of the State of Florida is the document that establishes and describes the powers, duties, structure and function of the government of the U.S. state of Florida, and establishes the basic law of the state. The current Constitution of Florida was ratified on November 5, 1968.\n\nFlorida has been governed by six different constitutions since acceding to the United States. Before 1838, only the Spanish Constitution of 1812 was briefly enacted in Florida. A monument commemorating \"La Constitución de Cádiz\" still stands in front of the Government House in St. Augustine.\n\nFlorida's first constitution as a U.S. territory was written and implemented in 1838. On March 3, 1845, Florida was granted admission into the Union as the 27th state. The current Constitution of Florida was ratified on November 5, 1968, and has been modified by initiative and referendum several times since.\n\nSee also Florida Constitutional Convention of 1838\n\nOne of the requirements for a United States territory to become a state of the union is that its constitution must be approved by the United States Congress. In order to fulfill that requirement, an act was passed by the Florida Territorial Council in 1838, approved by Governor Richard Keith Call, calling for the election of delegates in October 1838 to a convention to be held at St. Joseph, Florida. The delegates were to draft a constitution and bill of rights for the Territory of Florida. The Constitutional Convention convened on December 3, 1838, with Robert R. Reid presiding as president and Joshua Knowles secretary. The work of the Convention was carried out by eighteen committees, whose members were familiar with that particular area of government. The process was a relatively simple one since they used the constitutions of several other Southern states as models. Only on the subject of banking did much debate take place. The Convention adjourned \"sine die\" on January 11, 1839.\n\nA handwritten copy of the 1838 Constitution or \"Form of Government for the People of Florida,\" signed by Convention President Robert Raymond Reid and Convention Secretary Joshua Knowles, resides at the State Archives of Florida. Considered \"a secretary's copy\" this document is the only known copy of the 1838 Constitution. The original Constitution, signed by all the delegates, has never been found. The preamble to the Constitution of 1838:\n\nIn 1860, the onrush of the American Civil War brought the election in Florida of a convention \"for the purpose of taking into consideration the position of this State in the Federal Union.\" Pursuant to an Act of the Legislature approved November 30, 1860, governor Madison S. Perry issued a proclamation calling an election on Saturday, December 22, 1860, for delegates to a Convention to address the issue of whether Florida had a right to withdraw from the Union. The Secession Convention met on January 3, 1861, in Tallahassee, and produced for adoption on January 10 an Ordinance of Secession and a Constitution which largely altered the existing Constitution. \n\nSome changes related directly to Florida's secession, such as substituting \"Confederate States\" for \"United States,\" removing the requirement that the governor be a citizen for the United States for ten years prior to his election, and declaring Florida to be \"a sovereign and independent nation.\" The governor's term was changed from four years to two years starting October 1865, an election never realized due to the Confederacy's defeat. The 1861 Constitution also added several sections affecting the power of General Assembly of Florida, such as limiting the duration of sessions, allowing it to license toll bridges and pass general laws for name changes, prohibiting it from allowing married women or minors to contract or manage their estates, and prohibiting it from legitimizing bastards. The General Assembly was also allowed to tax the lands and slaves of non-residents higher than residents and create special tribunals to try offenses committed by slaves, freemen, and mulattoes. Public lands previously ceded to the United States government were deemed reclaimed by Florida but were to be used exclusively for paying the State's debts and necessary expenses, and such lands could not be granted for any other purpose. Prohibitions on certain bankers and certain previous office holders from being elected until the expiration of a year from having left their prior position were removed. The 1861 Constitution was the first Florida Constitution to contain a clause prohibiting individuals from holding two offices simultaneously with limited exceptions. No citizen of any of the States or Territories of the United States then at war with the Confederate States could be admitted to Florida citizenship, be eligible to vote or be elected, hold property, or work in the State of Florida. The articles pertaining to the militia and corporations were largely reworded. The General Assembly lost the ability to amend the Constitution, leaving a State convention as the only method of amendment. The prohibition on the General Assembly forbidding emigrants to the State from bringing their slaves with them was repealed. The article pertaining to the seat of government was removed. Other changes included removing obsolete language stemming from Florida's creation as a State and codifying legislation enacted since Florida attained statehood.\n\nJohn C. McGehee of Madison County was elected president of the Convention, and the Convention ratified the Constitution adopted by the Confederate States of America on April 13 and adjourned sine die on April 27, 1861.\n\nSince the Convention generally approved of Governor Perry's actions it made no move to interfere with his administration. However, when Governor John Milton took office in October 1861 and reversed some policies of his predecessor, a movement was started to reconvene the Convention. Convention president McGehee issued a proclamation on December 13 for the convention to meet on January 14, 1862, at Tallahassee. McGehee expressed concern over two matters: the state's finances and the powers of the governor during wartime. To remedy the latter, the members appointed an Executive Council of four men to share the executive authority because they felt that the powers of a wartime executive should not be placed in the hands of one man. The Convention adjourned sine die on January 27, 1862.\n\nIn October 1865, delegates met to revoke the Ordinance of Secession and write a new Constitution. This Constitution, since it limited suffrage to white male citizens, did not meet the requirements of Congress for seating delegates from the former Confederate states, and it was scrapped in favor of the Constitution of 1868.\n\nThe Reconstruction Era constitution returned civilian control of the state after Florida became subject to the military authority of the federal government in 1867. Pursuant to an Act of Congress, General John Pope, Commander of the Third Military District, issued an order on April 8, 1867, dividing the 39 counties of the State into 19 districts for the election of delegates to a convention to frame a new State Constitution. The new constitution had to conform with the Federal Constitution, including the 13th and 14th Amendments. \n\nThe Convention met in Tallahassee on January 20, 1868. As deliberations got under way, bitterly divided factions were formed. Of the 46 elected delegates, 18 were black and at least 15 were former slaves, who were described as literate, \"gentlemen\", and \"eloquent\" by a Northern reporter who was present. According to historian Adam Wasserman, \"The radical delegates were in the vast majority and backed by a large militant black electorate.\" The \"moderates\" were \"a powerful organized lobby of Southern planters, Northern capitalists, and capitalists\". \n\nFor two weeks, the \"radical\" and \"moderate\" factions debated. Under the leadership of future governor Harrison Reed, the \"moderates\" tried to give the sparsely-populated white counties the same voting power as the heavily-populated black counties. The \"radicals\", however, would not agree to such an arrangement.\n\nSeeing no chance of victory, 19 of the \"moderate\" delegates decamped to nearby Monticello, Florida. The \"radical\" majority proceeded to craft \"the initial and legitimate constitution\", signed it, and then adjourned for a week to hear back from the Reconstruction military commander, General George Meade. On February 10, the 21 \"moderate\" delegates, with the aid of Democratic governor and ex-Confederate general David S. Walker, broke into the hall at midnight. To ensure a quorum, soldiers seized two of the \"radical\" delegates (who were in bed), and forced them to the hall. Between midnight and 2 AM, the \"moderates\" drafted a new constitution, \"protected by a guard of Federal soldiers outside the hall\". When the day came for the legal convention to meet again, soldiers with bayonets prevented the \"radicals\" from entering the hall.\n\nThe two constitutions were both submitted to General Meade; the Committee on Reconstruction subsequently adopted the \"moderate\" one, on Meade's recommendation. Under its terms for reapportionment, less than one-fourth of voters would be able to elect a majority of the State Senate, and less than one-third could elect a majority of the Assembly. As stated in a letter to Senator David Yulee, \"Under our Constitution the Judiciary & State officers will be appointed & the apportionment will prevent a negro legislature.\" Freedmen's Bureau agent William J. Furman later bragged that he had prevented Florida from being \"niggerized\".\n\nThe Constitution was adopted by the people of Florida in May 1868. It conferred the electoral franchise upon \"male persons\" instead of \"white male persons\", as in the 1865 Constitution. With its acceptance by the Federal military authorities, the State of Florida was recognized as being restored to the Union, and its senators and representatives were admitted to Congress.\n\nThis constitution stated that one seat in the House of Representatives and one in the Senate were to be allocated to the Seminole Indians; the seats were to be filled by a member of their tribe \"and in no case by a white man.\" However, these positions were never filled, and this provision was not carried over into subsequent constitutions.\n\nThe Florida Constitutional Convention of 1885 produced a constitution that reversed some of the aspects of the 1868 Constitution by establishing a poll tax to further disenfranchise African Americans. It also codified segregation. It established the makeup of the state government that continued until 1968.\n\nThe 1885 Legislature enacted Chapter 3577 calling for a Constitutional Convention in order to revise the Constitution of 1868. In May 1885 a general election for the selection of delegates was held throughout the state. The Convention met in Tallahassee from June 9 to August 3, 1885. Samuel Pasco of Jefferson County presided. Pursuant to Ordinance No. 1 of the Convention, the Constitution was submitted to the citizens of Florida for ratification in November 1886. The 1885 Constitution was ratified by a 31,803 to 21,243 vote.\n\nThe new constitution legitimized a poll tax as a prerequisite for voting (Article VI, Section 8), thus effectively causing disfranchisement of blacks and many poor whites. By 1888, voter turnout had decreased by 27%, and additional provisions were adopted that further suppressed voters registration and turnout. This constitution mandated racial segregation in schools (Article XII, Section 12), and prohibited marriage between \"a white person and a person of negro descent\" (Article XVI, Section 24).\n\nThe current Florida Constitution of 1968 was proposed on June 24-July 3 of 1968 via three joint resolutions in special sessions of the Florida Legislature. House Joint Resolution 1-2X included all revisions except for Article V, Article VI, and Article VIII. Senate Resolution 4-2X proposed the new Article VI which relates to elections and suffrage. Senate Resolution 5-2X proposed a new Article VIII which defined law regarding local government. Article V was included from the 1885 constitution as amended. Chesterfield Smith was the chair of the committee which drafted the Constitution; LeRoy Collins was also on the committee.\n\nThe constitution was ratified via referendum by the electorate on November 5, 1968.\n\nThe political context of this new Constitution was that it was a necessary step toward fair apportionment of legislative districts, required by the US Supreme Court in various decisions in the 1960s. Many states, including Florida. had allotted a fixed number of senators per county, regardless of population, since the republic began. This violated the new federal court decisions. The regular political process had failed to remedy this. The malapportionment, until the new Constitution, had strongly favored rural, North Florida legislators, including the Pork Chop Gang, over legislators from more populous, urban districts. In 1960, \"12.3% of the population could elect a majority in the state senate and 14.7% could do the same in the lower house.\"\n\nThe 1968 Constitution eliminated the prior ban on racially integrated schools.\n\nA Blaine Amendment banned the use of public funds to support sectarian private schools.\n\nThe 1998 Constitutional Revision Commission proposed a rewrite of Article IV, Section IV of the Florida Constitution that reduced the Florida Cabinet from six elected officials to three. The change became effective January 7, 2003, and the Florida Cabinet now consists of the attorney general, the chief financial officer and the commissioner of agriculture. The secretary of state and commissioner of education became appointed positions and their respective agencies became the responsibility of the governor. The revised constitution also created a new State Board of Education with seven members appointed by the governor to oversee the Department of Education. The Cabinet offices of Florida state treasurer/insurance commissioner/fire marshal and comptroller were combined into the new position of chief financial officer who serves as head of the newly created Department of Financial Services.\n\nIn 2012, a measure attempting to repeal the Blaine Amendment did not win a majority, much less the 60% approval a constitutional amendment requires.\n\nA Constitutional Revision Commission was held in 1977-78 with the following delegates:\n\nThe outcome of the commission was placing, for voter consideration and approval, eight potential constitutional amendments on the Florida ballot. None of them were passed.\n\nArticle V of the Florida Constitution, relating to the Judicial Branch, was not included in the 1968 revision. Not until 1971 in a special session did the Legislature pass Senate Joint Resolution 52-D proposing to the voters the \"modern\" Article V.\n\nThe first article of the Florida Constitution contains the state's bill of rights which is very similar to the United States Bill of Rights except that there are more elaborations very similar to interpretations of the Bill of Rights by the United States Supreme Court, such as a clause stating that the freedom of religion cannot be used to justify immoral acts. Florida's Declaration of Rights also states that capital punishment is not unconstitutional. Search and seizure and cruel and unusual punishment protections are to be consistent with the United States Supreme Court's interpretation of those rights.\n\nThe Florida constitution provides for an executive, legislative, and judicial branch. Unlike the U.S. Constitution, it mandates a separation of powers. The Florida Supreme Court has interpreted the \"separation of powers\" requirement to prohibit both encroachment by any one branch on the powers held by another and delegation by any branch of its powers.\n\nSection one denotes the official state boundaries.\n\nSection two denotes basic rights.\n\nSection three prescribes for separation of powers.\n\nSection seven mandates that those living in the Everglades Protection Area, who cause water pollution, will be primarily responsible for its remediation.\n\nSection nine mandates that English is the official language of the state.\nArticle III requires that the Florida Legislature be a bicameral body, with an upper house of not more than 40 members elected to four-year terms, and a lower house of not more 120 members elected to two-year terms.\n\nSections 10 and 11 discuss special laws (those affecting portions of the state, not the entire) and prohibitions against it.\n\nSection six discusses the \"single subject requirement\" limitation on laws.\n\nSections 20 and 21 set standards for drawing congressional and legislative districts.\n\nArticle IV governs the election of the Florida governor and lieutenant governor, and of the Florida Cabinet. It currently specifies that the cabinet will consist of an attorney general, a chief financial officer, and a commissioner of agriculture with specifically defined powers, and it designates them as elected rather than appointed.\n\nArticle V establishes the Florida Supreme Court and the Florida District Courts of Appeal, as well as circuit and county courts, describes how they are to be appointed, and sets forth their jurisdiction. It has been amended a number of times since ratification of the 1968 Constitution. Most notably, the voters approved extensive amendments in 1972 to create a unified state courts system, placing all lower courts under the administrative supervision of Florida's chief justice. This change required the creation of a new Florida Office of the State Courts Administrator, which assists the chief justice. The 1972 amendments further reduced the different kinds of courts that existed in Florida from ten to four and made this system uniform throughout the state for the first time in Florida history. An amendment ratified in 1976 ended contested elections for Florida's appellate judges and made them subject to merit retention votes under a modified Missouri Plan.\n\nDiscusses the requirements for voters and when voting rights are disqualified.\n\nSection 4(b) places eight-year term limits on all legislative and executive office holders. (The section also places limits on Congressional officeholders; however, these provisions were ruled unconstitutional elsewhere and thus have no effect.)\n\nArticle VII specifically prohibits the levying of an income tax, except via very strict limitations.\n\nThe article further delineates the purposes for which bonds can be issued, and requires that certain bonds be approved by the voters in the affected area.\n\nArticle VIII covers municipal and county government, and distinguishes between charter counties and non-charter counties. Two key distinctions are set forth therein:\n\n\nSection 1 of this Article also establishes the following elected county officers for terms of four years:\n\nDiscusses both PK-12 and college/university public education.\n\nThough many states have laws requiring smaller classroom sizes, Section 1(a) places this as a constitutional requirement that, by 2010, the legislature will provide adequate funding so that PK-3 classes do not exceed 18 students/teacher, 4-8 classes do not exceed 22 students/teacher, and 9-12 classes do not exceed 25 students/teacher. Extracurricular classes are specifically exempt.\n\nSection 1(b) also mandates a voluntary PK-4 program in all public schools.\n\nUnder Section 4, each county is a separate school district, though contiguous counties may combine into one school district upon voter approval.\n\nSection 5 requires that the county school superintendent is elected by the voters unless legislation has been passed which allows the individual to be employed by the school board.\n\nSection 7 discusses the Florida State University System and its bi-level governing structure.\n\nThe overall system is governed by a 17-member Board of Governors, of which 14 members are appointed by the governor of Florida with the consent of the Florida Senate and serve staggered seven-year terms. The remaining three members consist of the Florida Commissioner of Education, the chair of the advisory council of faculty senates (or the equivalent), and the president of the Florida Student Association.\n\nIn addition, each university is governed by a 13-member Board of Trustees, of which six members are appointed by the governor and five members appointed by the Board of Governors, with the consent of the Florida Senate and serve staggered five-year terms. The remaining two members consist of the chair of the university's faculty senate and the president of the university's student body.\n\nIncludes various provisions.\n\nSection 4 lays out Florida's homestead exemption provision, considered one of the most protective in the nation for resident property owners. The provision exempts from forced sale (except to pay taxes, mortgages, or mechanic's lien) 160 acres of contiguous land plus all improvements (if located outside a municipality) or 1/2 acre of contiguous land plus all improvements (if located inside a municipality), regardless of the property's value, plus personal property up to US$1,000. Upon the owner's death, the exemptions extend to the surviving spouse or to the heirs.\n\nSection 6c, resulting from the \"Kelo v. City of New London\" decision, prohibits the conveyance of property taken by eminent domain to another person or private entity without 3/5ths approval of both houses of the Florida Legislature.\n\nThis article contains sections both prohibiting lotteries (Section 7) and simultaneously allowing them (Section 15).\n\nSection 16 discusses about the limitations on marine net fishing.\n\nSection 20 contains the constitution prohibition against smoking in all indoor workplaces.\n\nSection 21 contains a prohibition \"[l]imiting cruel and inhumane confinement of pigs during pregnancy\".\n\nSection 22 requires parental notification prior to a minor obtaining an abortion.\n\nSection 24 specifies the state minimum wage. Unlike the Federal and other state minimum wage laws, this section contains an annual index to adjust the wage for inflation (the wage is adjusted effective January 1 of each year).\n\nSection 25, re-enacted as \"Amendment 7,\" regards a patient's right to discover records related to adverse medical incidents\n\nSection 26 required the automatic revocation of any medical license where the provider has committed three or more incidents of medical malpractice.\n\nThe method of \"compilation\" for the Florida Constitution is unlike that of the federal constitution. When the Florida Constitution is amended the official text of the document is edited, removing language that is no longer in force. The Division of Statutory Revision within the Office of Legislative Services is responsible for codifying new amendments and removing obsolete language.\n\nHowever, the constitution usually includes history notes appended to the sections indicating when parts of it were amended, except that sections which were a part of the 1968 revision do not contain history notes prior to 1968. The section, indexes, headings, and notes are considered editorial features and not part of the Constitution per se, and thus do not convey any rights.\n\nThe Florida Constitution provides five methods for proposing amendments:\n\nExcept as noted below, all amendments proposed, regardless of the method of proposal, must be approved by 60 percent of the voters in a referendum held simultaneously with the next general election (that is, the next one at least 90 days after the amendment is filed with the custodian of state records) before they become a part of the Constitution. Previously, the ballot initiatives required only a simple majority (more than 50%) to be approved. A 2006 amendment raised the required threshold to a supermajority (60%).\n\nAmendments involving the creation of \"new State taxes or fees\" require a two-thirds approval of the voters.\n\nThe Legislature, via a three-fourths majority, may pass a law calling for a special election date on any amendment (again, which must be 90 days after the amendment is filed with the custodian of state records).\n\nMany diverse, and sometimes controversial, amendments have been proposed to the Florida Constitution over the years. From modifications to the amendment process itself to parental notification of a minor's intent to terminate a pregnancy, to minimum wage increases, to limiting cruel and inhumane confinement of pigs during pregnancy.\n\nArticle I, Section 23 of the Florida Constitution provides:\n\nThe provision was proposed during the 1978 Constitutional Revision Commission by Chief Justice Overton of the Florida Supreme Court. It was put to the electorate by the Commission as part of a package of provisions in a single amendment, which failed. In 1980, the Florida Legislature, believing there was significant public interest in this provision, passed a resolution placing the provision as a single amendment on the 1980 general election that was approved by voters, becoming a part of the Florida Constitution.\n\nThe provision extends to the private lives of all natural persons, including minors, but only protects them from intrusion by \"government\", not private individuals or corporations. It affords more protection than the right to privacy under the Federal Constitution. Like most rights, it is not unlimited, but state courts use the \"compelling state interest\" standard of review which looks at whether the government has a compelling interest for any actions implicating this right. For example, while individuals may possess obscene materials in their homes, there is no right to privacy to patronize retail establishments selling such material. The Florida Supreme Court has also decided that using one's real property in violation of legitimate environmental protection laws is not protected by this provision, as there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in such use. The clause \"except as otherwise provided herein\" ensures that the provision does not impair law enforcement activities under Article I, Section 12 on searches and seizures, which is interpreted in parallel with the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nCase law invoking this provision is divided into two main categories: personal autonomy and disclosure of information. The provision guarantees individual the right to refuse life-saving medical treatment, food, and water—but does not give individuals a right to physician-assisted suicide—and protects the right to receive an abortion. In contrast, the Florida Supreme Court has held that the state has a compelling interest in compelling applicants for the state bar association to provide mental health records and that a municipality that was self-insured for healthcare benefits could require job applicants to disclose whether they smoke at home.\n\nOn the November 5, 2000 general election, voters approved a citizens initiative referendum to amend the Florida Constitution to require the construction of a Florida high-speed corridor statewide rail system connecting all of the state's major cities. The rail system would likely run alongside the state's interstate system, and would likely be similar to those found in Japan and other locales.\n\nHowever, in 2004, the amendment was removed from the constitution via another ballot referendum. Governor Jeb Bush and some other legislators pushed for the inclusion of the ballot item to remove the amendment, claiming the rail network would be too costly to build. Jeb Bush, however, claimed that he was not opposed to the eventual construction of such a system, but that it should be managed by the Florida Department of Transportation. Proponents dispute the claim that the cost would be too high and say the presented cost estimates were highly exaggerated.\n\nIn the wake of the project's cancellation, a private sector express passenger service running across much of the proposed route was proposed by the Florida East Coast Railway. This project, Brightline (now Virgin Trains USA), began operations in early 2018.\n\n"}

The rule as subsequently adopted is that the Speaker, in any division upon a bill, should vote to leave a bill in its existing form.\n\nThe principle is always to vote in favour of further debate, or, where it has been previously decided to have no further debate or in some specific instances, to vote in favour of the status quo. Thus, the Speaker will vote:\n\nThe thinking behind the rule is that change should only occur if an actual majority vote is in favour of the change. \n\nSpeaker Denison's rule is now a guiding principle in many other bodies that have neutral chairpersons.\n\n"}

The constitution outlines the three branches of government in Georgia. The legislative branch is embodied in the bicameral General Assembly. The executive branch is headed by the Governor. The judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Court. Besides providing for the organization of these branches, the Constitution carefully outlines which powers each branch may exercise.\n\nThe current Georgia State Constitution was ratified on November 2, 1982. It is the newest state constitution in the United States and is Georgia's tenth Constitution, replacing the previous 1976 constitution.\n\nAmendments to the Constitution may be proposed in the Georgia legislature and must be approved by a two-thirds majority vote of both the state House and state Senate followed by ratification by a majority of the electors qualified to vote for members of the General Assembly at the next general election which is held in the even-numbered years. The Constitution can also be amended by proposal at a constitutional convention, the calling of which must receive the support of a two-thirds majority vote by both houses of the legislature and a simple majority of state voters.\n\nGeorgia has had ten different constitutions in its history. Prior to having a formal constitution, a document entitled Rules and Regulations of the Colony of Georgia, drafted in 1776, was in effect. A year later, in 1777, the first formal constitution was drafted, followed by the constitutions of 1789, 1798, 1861 (after joining the Confederate States of America), 1865, 1868, 1877, 1945, 1976, and 1983. All constitutions up until 1945 were drafted by constitutional convention. That year, Governor Ellis Arnall appointed a twenty-three member commission, composed of all three branches of government, to write a new constitution.\n\nIn 1977, a select committee was created to discuss revision of the 1976 constitution. Members included the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House, the Attorney General, representatives of the General Assembly and the judicial branch. Agreement on a constitution was made in August 1981 and in August and September of that year the document was submitted to the General Assembly in a special session. The constitution was approved on 25 September 1981 and went to vote in the general election and was ratified on 2 November 1982. The current Constitution streamlined the previous one and did away with authorization for local amendments. Of all U.S. States, Georgia has had the most State Constitutions of all, with 10 to date.\n\nThe Constitution consists of a Preamble and eleven Articles.\n\nThe Preamble to the Georgia State Constitution is a brief introductory statement describing the principles which the Constitution is meant to serve. It expresses in general terms the intentions of its authors. It does not grant nor prohibit any authority to the state government. However, it has at times been used by the Supreme Court of Georgia to help in deciding a case. For instance, the Preamble was cited in 1982 in \"Roberts v. Ravenwood Church of Wicca\", and later the portion of the Preamble which states \"\"...promote the interest and happiness of the citizen and of the family...\"\" was used in several court cases regarding family issues such as \"Clabough v. Rachwal\", \"Dixon v. Dixon\" and \"Arnold v. Arnold\".\n\nArticle One describes the Georgia Bill of Rights. These are the Rights of Persons, the Origin and Structure of Government and other General Provisions. The first Section, the Rights of Persons, lists twenty-eight paragraphs of individual rights. Many of these rights are similar to the rights listed in the United States Bill of Rights. Yet, there are differences. For instance, the Georgia Bill of Rights lists among its freedoms the Freedom of Conscience, which is the \"\"natural and inalienable right to worship God, each according to the dictates of that person's own conscience\"\" without interference and adds the right to religious opinion along with freedom of religion. Section II describes the \"origin and foundation of government\", the \"object of government\" the separation of powers and the superiority of civil authority over military authority. Also, this section explicitly describes the separation of church and state. Finally, Section III, General Provisions, deals with Eminent Domain, private ways and Tidewater titles.\n\nArticle Two describes Voting and Elections in Georgia. Specifically, the three Sections of the Article deal with the method of voting and the right to register and vote; general provisions and suspension and removal of public officials.\n\nArticle Three describes the Legislative Branch of Georgia's government. The Article establishes legislative powers; the General Assembly's composition; officers of the General Assembly; organizations and procedures; the enactment of laws; the exercise of legislative power; method of impeachment; insurance regulation; appropriations; and retirement systems. Representatives must be at least 21 years old, have been a citizen of the state for at least two years, and be a resident of their district for at least one year. Senators must be 25 years old, have been a citizen for two years, and live in the district they represent for at least one year. Article Three establishes meetings, time limit and adjournment of the General Assembly and allows each house to establish its own rules of procedure, provide for its own employees and interim committees may be created by the General Assembly or by either house.\n\nArticle Four describes Constitutional Boards and Commissions. This Article consists of seven Sections describing six boards and commissions and their powers. Section I deals with the creation of a Public Service Commission to regulate utilities. Section II created a State Board of Pardons and Paroles. Section III instituted a State Personnel Board and Section IV created the State Transportation Board. Sections V and VI are responsible for the Veterans ServiGeorgia Constitution: Article IV Accessed June 8, 2008. </ref>\n\nArticle Five describes the Executive Branch of Georgia's government. This Article is made up of four Sections. Section I details the election of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. Section II lists the duties and powers of the Governor. Section III discusses other elected officials and Section IV discusses the disability of executive officers and how to go about choosing a successor should an executive officer become permanently disabled.\n\nArticle Six describes the Judicial Branch of Georgia's government. This Article contains ten Sections which discuss the different courts and their powers and jurisdictions. Article Six also details the role of the district attorney in Georgia's justice system. Article Six also solidified the courts which, prior to the current constitution, were terribly fragmented.\n\nArticle Seven deals with Taxation and Finance in Georgia. There are four Sections, each dealing with the power of taxation; exemptions from ad volorem tax; purposes and methods of state taxation and state debt. Powers of taxation cited in the Constitution include the limitation on grants of tax powers; taxing power limited and uniformity of taxation. Also included are the classification of property; assessment of agricultural land and utilities. Sections II and III, dealing with exemptions from ad volorem taxation and purposes and methods of state taxation respectively, focus on voiding unauthorized tax exemptions; exemptions from taxation on property; locally authorized exemptions; purposes for which powers may be exercised regarding taxation; revenue and the general fund and grants to counties and municipalities. Section IV's role regarding state debt is spelled out in eleven different paragraphs.\n\nArticle Eight of the Constitution describes Education. This Article deals with public schools; boards and offices responsible for education; local school systems; taxation and educational assistance.\n\nArticle Nine describes Counties and Municipal Corporations. Article Nine contains seven Sections concerning counties; home rule for counties and municipalities; intergovernmental relations; taxation power of county and municipal governments; limitation on local debt; revenue bonds and community improvement districts.\n\nArticle Ten of the Constitution describes Amendments to the Constitution. This Article has only one Section with nine paragraphs discussing amendments.\n\nArticle Eleven of the Constitution describes Miscellaneous Provisions. The Article contains one Section with six paragraphs discussing the continuation of officers, boards, commissions, and authorities; judicial review and the preservation of existing law (law prior to the creation and ratification of the Constitution of 1983); confirmation of proceedings of courts and administrative tribunals; the continuation of a number of amendments for the next four years following the 1983 constitution going into effect; special commissions created and the date when the constitution became effective.\n\nArticle X of the Georgia Constitution provides provisions for changing the constitution. Specifically Paragraphs I, II, and IV deal with the subject. To amend the constitution or to begin a constitutional convention for the creation of a new document, such amendments must be proposed by the General Assembly, according to Paragraph I. Furthermore, such a proposal must originate as a resolution in either the Senate or the House of Representatives. Then, the \"proposal by the convention to amend this Constitution or for a new Constitution shall be advertised, submitted to, and ratified by the people in the same manner provided for advertisement, submission, and ratification of proposals to amend the Constitution by the General Assembly,\" according to Paragraph IV.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2117452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117452", "title": "Superman: Birthright", "text": "Superman: Birthright\n\nSuperman: Birthright is a twelve-issue comic book limited series published by DC Comics in 2003 and 2004, written by Mark Waid and drawn by Leinil Francis Yu and Gerry Alanguilan.\n\nOriginally, this series was intended to be a non-canon version of Superman, showcasing his origin and updating him for the 21st century. Soon after, it was decided to adopt the series as canon, and thus it replaced John Byrne's \"The Man of Steel\" series as Superman's canonical origin story. This editorial position lasted until the 2005–2006 \"Infinite Crisis\" crossover event, and the release of the new origin story; \"\" in 2009.\n\nThe story begins with a retelling of the destruction of planet Krypton. Jor-El laments the fact that his world accomplished \"miracles no one will remember\" while he is busy preparing infant Kal-El's voyage. Kal-El's shuttle pod fires into space moments before the planet's destruction. Jor-El and his wife Lara regret that they will never know if Kal-El survives the journey.\n\nTime winds forward to present day West Africa, where an ethnic conflict between the fictional Ghuri and Turaaba clans is claiming lives (this conflict is very reminiscent of the Hutu and Tutsi wars in Rwanda). Clark Kent, a freelance reporter in his early twenties, arrives to cover the conflict, and to meet with the Ghuri political leader and human rights activist, Kobe Asuru.\n\nThey first meet as Kent is forced to protect Asuru from an assassination attempt. Kent deflects a hail of bullets away from Asuru, but in the chaos and confusion of the firefight, is able to deflect suspicion of his superhuman powers. Over the course of several days, Clark and Asuru establish a rapport and become friends. Asuru emphasizes the Ghuri tradition of honoring ancestors through wearing symbolic clothing and working for human rights. While Clark and Kobe establish a quick connection, Kobe Asuru's sister Abena is suspicious of Kent's motives and at one point accuses him of cultural imperialism and acting in a condescending \"white savior\" manner to the Ghuri.\n\nAlone in the African savannahs, Clark tries out his developing superpowers, flying ahead of birds and animals and playfully wrestling a lion.\n\nLater, Clark interviews the Turaaba politician Rep. Kebile who dislikes Kobe and oppresses Ghuri rights. While protecting Abena Asuru from a thrown bomb, Clark hears a commotion and flies back to the rally (carrying Abena Asuru on his back) where Kobe has already been fatally stabbed. Enraged, Clark grabs the fleeing assassin and throws him into a wall, demanding to know who hired him. The terrified killer raises his arm—pointing directly at Kebile, who is incidentally surrounded by media. Kebile is besieged with questions and is later forced to resign. A final Africa scene reveals Abena Asuru, who has assumed her party's leadership role after her brother's death, now knows Clark is a super-powerful being, but she promises to remain silent.\n\nClark returns to Smallville, determined to learn more about his alien heritage. He tells his mother Martha that he wants to unearth his spaceship. He and Martha use the data tablet that came with Clark from Krypton to examine holographic records of Kryptonian history. Inspired by Kobe Asuru's stories of honoring tradition, Clark realizes the S insignia had great significance on Krypton and seemed to symbolize the Kryptonians' hope for a better tomorrow. He refuses to wear a mask while taking flight. Martha's solution is that only Clark's \"human half\" requires a disguise. She dresses him in professional, nerdy attire that stands apart from his usual look and gives him prescription glasses to wear. She promises they will refract light so no one will notice his startling blue eyes (which would otherwise give him away). Clark learns to slouch and act nervous and clumsy, to distance his civilian identity from tall, self-assertive Superman.\n\nHe travels to Metropolis to apply for a position at the \"Daily Planet\". When he arrives, he finds robotic anti-terrorist helicopters criss-crossing the sky. Upon reaching the \"Planet\" building, he sees the publisher, Mr. Galloway, berating Jimmy Olsen for fetching him the wrong yogurt. Lois Lane appears and yells at Galloway for humiliating Jimmy. When Galloway storms off, Clark introduces himself to Lois and is immediately smitten with her. He finally meets Perry White for a one-on-one interview, but it does not go well. Moments later, a miniature robo-chopper hovering outside goes berserk and opens fire on the Daily Planet building. When no one is looking, Clark ducks out to change into his costume and flies off to repel the helicopters. When he rips a radio transmitter off one of the wrecked units, he uses his powers to trace the signal to the incomplete skyscraper in the distance: LexCorp.\nClark bursts into Lex Luthor's office, just as Luthor is speaking to someone via radio. He tells Luthor he saw the signals and knows he sabotaged the Army choppers. Luthor is amused that he thinks anyone could possibly convict him on such evidence and demands to know who designed the technology that allows him to fly. At that moment, LexCorp's armored security barges in, with Lois and Jimmy right behind them. When Lois asks what Lex's connection is to Metropolis' new hero, Lex pretends to endorse the caped figure, saying, \"He is a friend to Lex Luthor\". The next day, the Daily Planet webpage dubs the hero \"SUPERMAN\". Luthor is ready with a cover story: a disgruntled Army employee was behind the attacks. LexCorp has stepped in to produce the robotic helicopters now that the Army's model has been recalled. But the LexCorp connection is an unprecedented black mark on Luthor's sterling reputation; Perry decides that Clark has earned his shot.\n\nLois and Clark visit Luthor at the massive towers that form his corporate headquarters. Luthor greets them both, but when Clark extends his hand as if they are old acquaintances, Luthor coldly dismisses it, claiming to have never met him. He presses a button on the console in his desk and the room transforms into a holographic theater. Luthor asserts that he is first and foremost an astrobiologist, and describes many lucrative LexCorp inventions that were designed solely on his theories of possible space life. He then pulls up images of Superman and makes an official statement; Superman is not of this Earth. Clark reports Luthor's findings to Perry, who orders he write it up. Clark protests, knowing that the revelation that Superman is an alien will drive people away and points out that they have no real proof. Perry insists, saying Luthor is the leading authority on this matter, which is proof enough. When Superman now goes out to rescue those in need, people are too fearful to even go near him.\n\nWhile sulking in an empty restaurant, Clark hears a commotion as a suspension bridge across town inexplicably blows up. Superman speeds off to reconnect the bridge cables, but another explosion rocks the bridge. In his office, Lex Luthor watches the disaster and triggers bombs along the support column, making it appear that Superman is the one tearing it down. As the finishing touch, a mechanical drone in the water aims kryptonite radiation at Superman, causing him to collapse.\nRealizing he has made an enemy in Lex Luthor, Clark looks back on his childhood in Smallville when a young Lex arrived in town. Lex was a quiet genius, but his intelligence alienated him from everyone around him. Lex's parents were unloving and ruthlessly trained him to become the next Einstein. Clark muses that \"they were underestimating him\". Despite his contemptuous exterior, Lex warmed to Clark when he discovered they shared a common interest: astronomy. Unfortunately, Lex was so \"fundamentally disturbed\" that he started spending increasing amounts of time locked in his makeshift laboratory next to the Luthor mansion. During one of these periods of seclusion, Clark visited Lex, who allowed Clark inside to unveil his new invention, a sub-space communicator. Lex hoped that with a piece of meteor rock (Kryptonite), he would finally be able to open a wormhole into visions from an alien civilization. While aware of the radiation emanating from the rock, Lex assured Clark that it was perfectly harmless. Clark, stricken with sudden pain, staggered back looking ghastly; he was experiencing his first bout of Kryptonite poisoning. Lex misread Clark's expression and believed he had become afraid of him like everyone else. Dismissing him from the lab and commencing with his experiment, he managed to open a portal into events and times of the planet Krypton for a moment, but his generator overloaded and exploded, engulfing the house in flames. Lex, his hair burned off, staggered through the flames to uncover the piece of Kryptonite that was integral to his machine. He neglected his father, who was buried beneath rubble and burning alive. In the present day, Lex begins piecing together instruments to recreate his failed experiment from long ago in the bowels of the research facility, hoping to retrieve the alien visions he saw before. As expected, the Kryptonite creates a wormhole and Luthor is greeted with a wealth of visions from the history of Krypton.\n\nThe next day, the newspapers blare warnings of an upcoming alien invasion, showing photos of alien warships bearing Superman's insignia. At the Daily Planet, Clark hears that the footage has been analyzed by experts and has been confirmed to be un-doctored and 100% legitimate. Having seen footage from the data tablet that was in his spacecraft, Clark knows Luthor must have used similar methods to uncover these images. Soon afterward, Metropolis is besieged by giant, monstrous-looking warships that bear Superman's logo on their face, including a giant mechanical spider. They begin killing indiscriminately. Troops empty out of the vehicles in Kryptonian garb, all bearing red capes and S-shields with their faces covered. Just as Superman is about to intervene, Luthor uses the spires of his skyscraper to project a citywide \"web\" of Kryptonite radiation from which Superman cannot hide. When the city police start firing on the vulnerable Superman, he assumes his Clark guise and meets up with Lois, who comments on how sick he looks. Upon returning to the newsroom, which is in chaos, Perry yells at Clark for coming to the office without a story on this crisis. Stripped of his powers and faced with imminent dismissal, Clark leaves a notice of resignation on his desk. When Lois catches him leaving, she calls him a \"spineless worm\", stating that they have an obligation to the public and she stood up for him. Clark leaves and Lois becomes furious.\n\nThe \"alien commander\", a man dressed in armor, calls himself \"Van-Gar\" and declares war on Earth. Clark, his confidence restored by Lois' sermon, dons his costume and charges Van-Gar's troops before they can open fire on a crowd of innocents. When Superman labels him and his men \"actors\", Van-Gar beats downs the weakened hero and whispers to him they're \"not in it for the money\". They believe Luthor is right and that Superman will turn on those weaker than him. Meanwhile, Lois sneaks back into the LexCorp building, which Luthor ordered abandoned. She sees Luthor giving orders to his men over his tele-screen and grabs his priceless shard of the Kryptonite with the \"S\" engraving out of its energy core, disabling the entire machine. However, she fails to notice Luthor, who emerges from the shadows behind her. With the Kryptonite removed, most of the robots attacking Metropolis are revealed as holograms and vanish, along with the Kryptonite web over the city.\n\nBack at LexCorp, Luthor grabs the Kryptonite crystal from Lois' hands and demands she tell him how much she knows. When Lois tells him everyone will know about his hoax, Lex drags Lois to a wall, where he uses a remote control to open out to a balcony. He reveals that he placed a Kryptonite bomb inside the suit of every \"Kryptonian\" soldier and that they are primed to go off and take out Superman in the blast. However, his men don't know about the bombs, since Luthor \"sort of left that part out of the hiring brief.\" He then shoves Lois off the skyscraper balcony. Superman is still down below and grappling with Van-Gar, whose armor suddenly starts glowing green. Superman soars up with Van-Gar in his grip, ripping the bomb off moments before it explodes. In the instant before Lois hits the ground, Superman rushes up and catches her just in time.\n\nSuperman returns to LexCorp, where Luthor is feverishly trying to reconnect with the static images to Krypton, this time to establish direct contact. Luthor begins requesting to be sent weapons before the machine overloads in his face, embedding several Kryptonite pellets in his face. Visions of the imminent destruction of Krypton swirl on the view screen; back on Krypton, many years in the past, one of the Kryptonians points to the sparring adversaries and says he can see them on his viewing screen, and he wonders if they are real. A desperate Luthor screams out \"No! I am real!... We can save each other!\" Jor-El and Lara appear seconds after they have launched baby Kal-El and say goodbye to one another. An awestruck Superman realizes that is his name: \"Kal-El\". Luthor attacks Superman from behind, telling him he's doing him a favor, it's agony to be alone in the world. Superman tells Luthor he wasn’t always alone, he made his choice, and punches him several times across the jaw. A bloodied Luthor lies defeated as Superman runs up and calls out something into the void; but the transmission is cut off too soon, and Superman thinks his parents never heard what he was trying to tell them. In the aftermath, Luthor is scarred from the Kryptonite shrapnel that sprayed in his face, and is facing indictment. Clark Kent writes the article that ruins Luthor's reputation, although Luthor has already assembled his lawyers and will probably beat the charges. \"Van-Gar\" was actually the leader of a group of extremist survivalists. Clark thanks Lois from dissuading him from quitting, but she reveales that he only has a job because she intercepted Clark's resignation letter which was written like a crybaby. Clark takes the opportunity to try to ask her out and is instantly rebuffed because. He jokingly asks if Lois would like him better if he could \"leap tall buildings in a single bound\". Lois, stuttering, asks Clark if he thinks she has a \"lame crush\" on Superman, implying that she does.\n\nDuring the last moments of Krypton, Jor-El and Lara look at a viewing screen with a static image crackling from it. A figure, barely visible and wearing the S-shield on his chest, says, \"Mother... Father... I made it!\" Realizing that their efforts were successful and their son Kal-El had survived to become a great hero, Jor-El and Lara kiss as the building collapses around them in Krypton's final moments.\n\nThe project was given to Mark Waid with the original request to give readers an origin to redefine Superman for the 21st century, a series that anyone on Earth can pick up and get in on the Superman story. To Waid, this was something he had wanted to do since seeing \"Superman: The Movie\", considering this series as the Mark Waid Superman story because he wanted to have everything he ever loved of the character in it.\n\nBy comparison to other origin retellings, Waid wanted some differences. His Superman is not infallible, as Waid argues that it is not Superman but Clark Kent that readers should relate to. Doing this made Waid avoid a \"Clark-is-dull\" trap as showing a Clark who gets chewed by the boss, whose dry cleaning gets lost, who longs to connect and be accepted, help make the character a touchstone. Another difference was having Africa in the origin which, as Waid has it, helps establish Kal-El/Clark as a citizen of the world, laying important ground and making him a journalist and not a typist.\n\n\nThe \"Infinite Crisis\" storyline altered Superman's history so that \"Birthright\" and John Byrne's \"The Man of Steel\" mini-series were removed as Superman's canonical origin. This was reinforced by then-monthly \"Superman\" writer Kurt Busiek's statement that the post-\"Infinite Crisis\" Superman's origin had yet to be established. The new origin was later revealed in the \"\" mini-series.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117459", "title": "Stephen Heard", "text": "Stephen Heard\n\nStephen Heard (November 1, 1740 – November 15, 1815) was the president of Georgia, a position that was, out of necessity, named from the Georgia House of Representatives and was later known as Governor. He served in this position from May 24, 1780 until August 18, 1781. One record lists Heard as resigning as president in 1782.\n\nHeard had fought in the French and Indian War and was a hero of the American Revolutionary War. He was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Georgia militia under Lieutenant John Dooly. He fought with Gen. Elijah Clarke at the Battle of Kettle Creek where he was captured. Heard was also a friend of George Washington.\n\nAfter serving as governor, he served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1779 to 1795. Heard was born in Hanover County, Virginia in 1740, and died in Elbert County, Georgia, in 1815, at the age of 75. His home is in Middleton, near Elberton.\n\nHeard's Fort was built in Wilkes County, Georgia as a stockade in 1774, by Stephen Heard. Heard's Fort was designated the Seat of Government for Georgia on February 3, 1780, a position it held until 1781. The Fort set the groundwork for what become the town of Washington, Georgia.\n\nStephen Heard is the namesake of Heard County, Georgia.\n\nStephen Heard was born in Hanover County, Virginia on November 1, 1740 to John Heard Jr. and Bridgett Carol Heard, wealthy tobacco farmers. Heard's paternal grandfather, John Sr., arrived in America from Ireland around 1720. Stephen was brought up in Virginia and received his primary education there; this would be the highest level of education Heard would receive.\n\nWith the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754 Heard left school in search of honor and adventure in the army. Along with some of his brothers, Heard enlisted in the Virginia colonial regiment under the command of Colonel (at the time) George Washington. This experience gave Heard a thorough understanding of warfare in the frontier which he would go on to use later in his life. During the war, Heard fought valiantly and was promoted by Washington to the rank of Captain. This military collaboration led to a lifetime friendship between George Washington and Stephen Heard. Heard would even go on to name his son George Washington Heard.\n\nAfter the French and Indian War the Heard family received a land grant of 150 acres for their service in what is today Wilkes County, Georgia, so Stephen, his brother Barnard, and their father John, moved their families here. This land was near the mouth of the Little River in an area that had not yet been secured from the Creek and Cherokee Indians. Because of this, the family constructed Heard's Fort as a refuge for travelers from Native American attacks and the wilderness. Heard's Fort was completely finished in 1774 and in 1780 would become the city of Washington, Georgia. For a time during the Revolutionary War Heard's Fort would serve as the temporary capitol of Georgia.\n\nWhen The Revolutionary War broke out Heard immediately joined the patriot cause along with fellow Georgians Elijah Clarke, Nancy Hart, and John Dooly who also lived in Wilkes County. Unfortunately for the rebels Georgia was very divided on the issue of independence and throughout the war the patriots faced a strong loyalist resistance. So much so that it led to tragedy for Heard. In the winter of 1778 while Stephen was away fighting, a group of Tories stormed his house burned it down and forced his wife Jane, and their adopted daughter out in to a snow storm where they would die from cold exposure. Despite the death of his family Heard continued to fight in the revolution. He participated in the Battle of Kettle Creek, he was involved in the most violent and dangerous part of the fight and according to one source Heard set himself apart by \"encouraging his men and leading them to points of danger and vantage.\" Unfortunately, Heard was captured at Kettle Creek and it would be his last battle of the revolution.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117463", "title": "Constitution of Louisiana", "text": "Constitution of Louisiana\n\nThe Louisiana Constitution is legally named the Constitution of the State of Louisiana and commonly called the Louisiana Constitution of 1974, and the Constitution of 1974. The constitution is the cornerstone of the law of Louisiana ensuring the rights of individuals, describing the distribution and power of state officials and local government, establishes the state and city civil service systems, creates and defines the operation of a state lottery, and the manner of revising the constitution.\n\nLouisiana's constitution was adopted (adopted in Convention) during the Constitutional Convention in 1974, ratified by the voters of the state on April 20, 1974, and became effective on January 1, 1975.\n\nThe beginning of statehood for Louisiana began with the Louisiana purchase in 1803. In 1804, the land the United States purchased from France was divided in two territories: 1) the Louisiana Territory (upper territory) and 2) the area below the 33rd parallel (current Louisiana-Arkansas state line), the Orleans Territory each as an organized incorporated territory of the United States. The Territory of Orleans formed the bulk of what today is the State of Louisiana.\nFrom the beginning there were border disputes. In 1795, the \"Treaty of Friendship, Limits, and Navigation Between Spain and the United States\", known as Pinckney's Treaty, had set the stage for long non-violent negotiations. An area between the Mississippi River and Perdido River (excluding New Orleans) was claimed by Spain as part of the West Florida Controversy. Also at issue was the area that became known as the neutral ground on the western border, meaning the territory had undefined borders. These disputes led to an end to diplomatic relations in 1805. Plantation owners proclaimed independence from Spain, establishing the short lived nation of the Republic of West Florida on Sept. 23, 1810, but President James Madison ordered U.S. forces into the area and incorporated it into the Orleans territory.\n\nSenator William Giles of Virginia had already submitted a petition for statehood, in March 1810, based on the ordinance of 1787. The senate passed the petition on April 27, 1810, by a vote of 15 to 8, and ordered the territory to assemble a convention to draft a constitutional amendment. Because the president incorporated the area of West Florida into the Orleans Territory, Representative Julien Poydras (Orleans Territory) on December 17, 1810, petitioned for statehood based on Article III of the Louisiana Purchase. On Dec. 27, U.S. Representative Nathaniel Macon submitted a petition based on the inclusion of the territory of West Florida.\n\nConfrontations were heated in the house that ranged from; the West Florida territory belonged to the Mississippi Territory (U.S. Representative William Bibb of Georgia), that the entire idea of expansion was unconstitutional without the vote of the people (U.S. Representative Richard Johnson of Kentucky), the undetermined borders (U.S. Representative Timothy Pitkin of Connecticut), and U.S. Representative Josiah Quincy's (Massachusetts) strong opposition;\n\n\"I address you, Mr. Speaker, with an anxiety and distress of mind with me wholly unprecedented. To me it appears that this measure would justify a revolution in this country. I am compelled to declare it as my deliberate opinion that, if this bill passes, the bonds of this Union are virtually dissolved.\", and \"The constitution is a political compact from which the original parties would be released if the assumed principle of this bill became law..\"\n\nAs a reaction to these comments House of Representative territorial delegate George Poindexter of Mississippi accused Quincy of treason. This resulted in a vote that Quincy won by a narrow margin of 56-53. With vindication Quincy continued;\n\nLouisiana statehood would produce states that were free \"from their moral obligation, and that, as it will be the right of all, so it will be the duty of some, to prepare, definitely, for a separation: amicably if they can, violently if they must!\n\nAfter much heated debate, the bill being passed back and forth between the House and Senate over seven times, an agreement was reached, a resolution signed, and a joint conference committee passed an identical bill April 6, 1812. The ninth anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase of April 30, 1812, was chosen to be the date of admittance. The name of the first new state west of the Mississippi was to be called \"Louisiana\". The issue of West Florida was solved with statehood but the western border dispute remained unresolved until the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819.\n\nThe first constitution was made after the Constitution of Kentucky with three stark differences. A Bill of Rights was not included, the system of law was (and still is) based on Civil law instead of English Common law, and the use of parishes instead of counties. The first constitution was drafted on January 22, 1812, and Louisiana became a U.S. State on April 30, 1812.\n\nIn Louisiana, the period of time from 1812 until the start of the American Civil War is considered to be the antebellum period, although some use 1789 as the beginning. The period gave renewed fever to abolitionists and in 1814 the founding of the Manumission Society of Tennessee furthered anti-slavery sentiment.\n\nThe Constitution of 1812, originally called the Constitution or Form of Government of the State of Louisiana, was biased against the common person, as only wealthy white men who paid taxes could vote. The U.S. House of Representatives displayed a prejudice and show of power that would prove to be indicative of the future of people of color in the United States and the state of Louisiana. Although the candidates for governor would be voted upon, the constitution provided that the legislature chose from the two who received the most votes.\n\nAn act entitled, \"An act to provide for the calling of a Convention for the purpose of re-adopting, amending or changing the Constitution of the State\", was approved March 18, 1845, and the senatorial and representative delegates met August 5, 1844 to update or replace what had been considered to be an outdated constitution of 1812.\n\nThe Constitutional Convention of 1845 included senatorial delegates from the \"counties\" of Acadia, Lafourche, Attakapas, Opelousas, Rapides, Ouachita, Pointe Coupee, and Iberville, as well as representative delegates from parishes.\n\nSome notable articles in the constitution:\n\nThe Constitution of 1852 included an increase in the number of Louisiana Supreme Court justices to five, restricted the governor's powers, and created a public works. The fourth district included Imperial Calcasieu Parish, before the separation of Cameron, Beauregard, Jefferson Davis and Allen Parishes.\n\nThe constitutional convention of 1861, convened to write a new constitution of the state of Louisiana, just modified the constitution of 1852, to reflect Louisiana's secession (January 26, 1861) from the union. Resolutions included the dissolution of the constitution of 1852, while enacting all provisions which effectively resulted in just a name change, adopting the constitution of the Confederate States of America, established provisions for the dissolution of the state government if approved by the citizens, and included provisions for new elections.\n\nThe Louisiana Constitution of 1864 abolished slavery throughout the state, but was effective only in the thirteen Louisiana parishes under Union control during the war. Voting rights to black men who fought for the Union, owned property, or were literate, were allowed to be authorized (but not given) by the state legislature. Other persons of color were excluded. A free public school system was allowed for all children aged six to eighteen, but the legislature established schools for whites only.\n\nThe failed Wade–Davis Bill included the Ironclad oath that was implemented by the Radical Republicans and used until repealed by President Arthur in May, 1884. The oath excluded ex-Confederate soldiers, anyone holding office in a state that seceded from the Union, or supporters of the Confederacy. This created further tension between persons of color and ex-Confederate soldiers. The lack of voting rights, Black codes, and a recall on the Constitutional Convention ultimately resulted in the New Orleans Riot.\n\nIn 1867, Louisiana and Texas was placed in the Fifth Military District under General Philip Sheridan. A Third Reconstruction Act (1867) allowed district commanders authority to remove state officials from office. Carpetbaggers were appointed to many offices to assure loyalty to the Union.\n\nA requirement for state Congressional representation, added by Congress as part of the Reconstruction Acts, was ratifying the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The constitution, adopted in conference March 7, 1868, was the first one in Louisiana to provide a formal bill of rights. It eradicated the Black Codes of 1865, removed property qualifications for holding office, and former Confederates were still disfranchised. Black men secured full citizenship with equal civil and political rights, state funded public education that prohibited segregated schools (Title VII; article 135) funded by one-half of the income from a poll tax (article 141), and equal treatment on public transportation. Title VI; article 75 provided a Supreme Court that consisted of a Chief Justice and four Associate Justices appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the state Senate, for eight year terms. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was adopted on July 9, 1868, and the Louisiana was readmitted to the Union.\n\nConsidered the best constitution in Louisiana history, it did not solve racial discrimination. For the next eight years, political fighting and corruption continued in Louisiana. The Reconstruction era finally came to a close in Louisiana and the rest of the South with the trading of votes at the national level that led to the election of Rutherford B. Hayes as President. Federal troops were withdrawn on April 29, 1877, and mostly white, conservative Democrats regained control of Louisiana.\n\nThe Constitution of 1879 was adopted in conference July 23, and was ratified December 8, 1879 returning Louisiana to home rule. The new constitution placed more limits on the voting rights of freedmen. The state capital was moved from New Orleans to Baton Rouge. The state Supreme Court retained five members, who were appointed by the governor for twelve-year terms, and for the first time were given supervisory power over inferior courts. A lottery was authorized (article 167) but gambling (article 172) was considered a vice to be suppressed.\n\nFrom 1872 to 1877 there had been essentially a dual government, as Democrats rejected the election of Republicans. During this period election cycle violence continued to increase as white Democrats sought to suppress the black Republican vote. Louisiana was torn, not unlike during the Civil war, with battles between the Radical Republicans and the Southern Democrats. With the Democrats resumption of power in 1877, the Solid South coalition was formed. The period of time from 1868 to 1879 was marked with violence against freedmen, as seen in the First Battle of the Cabildo (March 5, 1873) and the Colfax massacre April 13, 1873), both events that arose from the disputed gubernatorial election of 1872. Charges related to the Colfax events reached the US Supreme Court. In \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1876), it supported federal restrictions on the civil freedoms supposedly guaranteed by the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the United States and the Louisiana Constitution. It denied African-American citizens the constitutional rights of the Fourteenth Amendment and the right to bear arms. \n\nThe Coushatta Massacre (1874), the Battle of Liberty Place (September 14, 1874), and the Second Battle of the Cabildo (January 1877), are instances of whites attacking blacks that involved the Redeemers and the White League, an insurgent paramilitary group. \n\nThe Freedmen's Bureau had reported a multitude of physical attacks on freedmen and their supporters in Louisiana from 1865 to 1868, when the Bureau was closed and no authority recorded this data. After the Bureau closed in 1872, atrocities were largely buried by local communities and seldom taken to court. Federal courts, as well as the Louisiana Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court, did not generally hear charges at the state level. Following the end of Reconstruction, the rate of lynchings of blacks increased, reaching a peak at the end of the 19th century, when Louisiana and other southern states passed new constitutions and laws to effectively disenfranchise African Americans.\n\nThe Louisiana Constitution of 1898, was adopted in Convention May 12, 1898. Article 197 provided restrictions, directed primarily at black voters. An annual poll tax of one dollar was levied (Article 198) on all males, ages twenty-one to sixty to be eligible to vote, with receipt of the two previous years being paid. The money to be used in the parish where the tax is levied and collected for education. For the first time women tax payers were allowed to vote (Article 199). An annual poll tax of one dollar was levied on every male between the ages of twenty-one and sixty to be used for public school maintenance (article 231). Parish road districts were created (Article 291) and taxes were authorized to include, an annual road maintenance poll tax of not more than one dollar for each able-bodied male (eighteen to fifty-five years old) authorized, with compulsory road service to be waved on those that paid the tax, and an annual road tax from twenty-five cents to one dollar for each vehicle, including bicycles, was levied. The state would support the old soldiers home (Article 302) known as Camp Nichols. Loyal, honorably discharged or paroled, indigent Confederate soldiers, referred to as inmates, were provided a pension of eight dollars a month. The home housed confederate soldiers into the 1940s.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court had ruled the Civil Rights Act of 1875 as unconstitutional in 1883. By the time of the convention the groundwork was laid for decades of segregation. On September 18, 1895, Booker T. Washington, an accommodationist, had given the Atlanta Exposition Speech, at the Cotton States and International Exposition. He was revered by followers and had critics such as William Monroe Trotter and W. E. B. Du Bois. An agreement was reached between black and white leaders that blacks would submit to white political rule in exchange for a guarantee of receiving basic education and due process in law. By 1890, Jim Crow Laws replaced black codes with a separate but equal status for black people. The United States Supreme Court Decision of \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" in 1896, stemming from the arrest of Homer Plessy in 1892, upheld racial segregation. Article 248 provided for free public separate schools, for \"white and colored\" races.\n\nThe 1898 constitution provided for conviction in \"cases in which the punishment is necessarily at hard labor\" by a verdict of nine out of twelve jurors. This provision survived into the 1974 constitution, but with the change to require a verdict of ten out of twelve. Research by Louisiana’s newspaper of record, \"The Advocate\", shows how this provision has been used to drive incarceration, especially of black people. The series, entitled “Tilting the Scales,” debuted Easter Sunday 2018, and would later win \"The Advocate\" its first Pulitzer Prize, as well as a George Polk Award. Praised by state lawmakers, the series had an impact on public opinion; Louisiana voters overwhelmingly voted to amend the Constitution of 1974 in November of 2018, requiring all future felony convictions to be unanimous.\n\nThe proceedings of the convention at which the 1898 constitution was developed and adopted contains the word \"supremacy\" at least eight times, including:\n\n\nA constitutional convention was called to re-fund the state debt and enlarge the powers of the New Orleans Sewer and Water Board. Concerns over possible Supreme Court constitutionality decisions led to a longer constitution with all sixty-six amendments to the Constitution of 1898 being included. Supreme Court Justices to be elected, more funding for education was provided, and five amendments to the Confederate Pension Plan.\n\nThe Louisiana Constitution of 1921, was adopted in convention June 18, 1921. A major concern was validity of some provisions of the Constitution of 1913.\nArticle IV: section 7; Authority to set minimum wage, regulate hours and working conditions for women and girls, with exceptions for agriculture and domestic service. Article IV: section 16; No law abolishing forced \"heirship\". Article VII: section 4; The Supreme Court justices increased to seven. Section 5; Supreme Court may sit in divisions of three, and two judges from the Court of Appeals may be called in for a third division to reduce backlogs. Section 6; Justices to be elected for a period of fourteen years.

{"id": "2117467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117467", "title": "New weird", "text": "New weird\n\nThe New Weird is a literary genre that emerged in the 1990s through early 2000s with characteristics of weird fiction and other speculative fiction subgenres. M. John Harrison is credited with creating the term \"New Weird\" in the introduction to \"The Tain\" in 2002. The writers involved are mostly novelists who are considered to be part of the horror or speculative fiction genres but who often cross genre boundaries. Notable authors include K. J. Bishop, Paul Di Filippo, M. John Harrison, Jeffrey Ford, Storm Constantine, China Miéville, Alastair Reynolds, Justina Robson, Steph Swainston, Mary Gentle, and Jeff VanderMeer, among others.\n\nPart of this genre's roots derive from pulp horror authors, whose stories were sometimes described as \"weird fiction\". The \"weird tale\" label also evolved from the magazine \"Weird Tales\"; the stories therein often combined fantasy elements, existential and physical terror, and science fiction devices. While New Weird fiction has been influenced by traditional weird fiction such as American H.P. Lovecraft's stories, much of the movement's early momentum is attributed to British writers. Magazines such as Interzone and The 3rd Alternative (currently known as Black Static) provided publication opportunities for genre-fluid writers of science fiction and horror.\n\nThe 2000 release of China Miéville's \"Perdido Street Station\" marked the entry of what would later be called New Weird fiction into mainstream consciousness with its critical and commercial success. The 2002 publication of the Miéville's novella, \"The Tain\", contain the first use of \"new weird\" as a genre category in its introduction written by M. John Harrison.\n\nIn 2003, Harrison created a forum post that sparked broader adoption of the term, asking \"The New Weird. Who does it? What is it? Is it even anything? Is it even New?\" and suggesting it may be a better alternative to the \"Next Wave\" label. \n\nThe 2008 publication of Ann Vandermeer and Jeff Vandermeer's anthology \"The New Weird\" provided a compilation of new weird stories and commentary, intended as a \"rough guide to the moment or movement known as 'New Weird' acknowledging that the pivotal 'moment' is behind us, but that this moment had already lasted much longer than generally believed, had definite precursors, and continues to spread an Effect, even as it dissipates or becomes something else.\"\n\nVarious definitions have been given of the genre. J.A. Weinstock's summary of Steph Swainston's response to the 2003 forum discussion sparked by M. John Harrison as \"exercises in worldbuilding characterized by a heterogeneity of sources, genres, and details\" and \"particularly eclectic; mixing modern street culture with ancient mythology.\" According to Jeff and Ann VanderMeer, in their introduction to the anthology \"The New Weird\", the genre is \"a type of urban, secondary-world fiction that subverts the romanticized ideas about place found in traditional fantasy, largely by choosing realistic, complex real-world models as the jumping-off point for creation of settings that may combine elements of both science fiction and fantasy.\" \n\nNon-conformity to strict genre definitions is a commonly recognized facet of new weird fiction. In The 3rd Alternative forum debate, Miéville emphasized this fluidity in his post stating that \"New Weird - like most literary categories - is a moment, a suggestion, a tease, an intervention, an attitude, above all an argument. You cannot read off a checklist and say 'x is in, y is out' and think you've understand what's at stake or what's being argued.\" According to Gardner Dozois, the VanderMeers' anthology \"ultimately left me just as confused as to what exactly The New Weird consisted of when I went out as I'd been when I went in.\" Robin Anne Reid notes that while the definition of the new weird is disputed, \"a general consensus uses the term\" to describe fictions that \"subvert cliches of the fantastic in order to put them to discomfiting, rather than consoling ends\". Reid also notes the genre tends to break down the barriers between fantasy, science fiction and supernatural horror. In comparing the new weird to bizarro fiction, Rose O'Keefe of Eraserhead Press claims that \"People buy New Weird because they want cutting edge speculative fiction with a literary slant. It’s kind of like slipstream with a side of weirdness.\"\n\nThe \"new weird\" descriptor has been applied to non-literary forms of media. Movies that have been recognized as fitting into the new weird descriptions include \"Pan's Labyrinth\" and the adaptation of Jeff Vandermeer's novel, \"Annihilation\". The video game, \",\" has also been recognized as new weird for its combination of fantasy, science fiction, and weird elements.\n"}

Speaking on 25 June 2005, Ganilau said that the Mara family had not been consulted about the legislation, was opposed to it, and would accept no compensation offered by the Commission to be established.\n\nGanilau said that her family was still reeling from the effects of the coup. She thought it \"ridiculous\" that the government was trying to \"\"excuse people involved in the coup\"\", even after the Fiji Week reconciliation ceremonies that ran from 4 to 11 October 2004, which she called a \"\"failed presentation.\"\" She said that it was \"\"not on.\"\" She called it \"\"a forced idea\"\" and questioned the government's motives for promoting it. \"\"If the move to reconcile and compensate came from the coup perpetrators maybe, I would have given it some thought but coming from the Government is hard to accept,\"\" she stated.\n\nGanilau said she was opposed to granting amnesty to people implicated in coup-related charges. \"\"It would set a dangerous precedent, that is why I am not condoning it,\"\" she declared.\n\nIn a further statement on 25 July, Ganilau said that the 2000 coup had not been spontaneous, but a premeditated and carefully planned act, which she accused some members of the present Senate of knowing about in advance.\n\nThe Fiji Times quoted Ganilau on 8 January 2006 as criticizing the Qarase government for supporting the writing of an independent biography of the life of her father, while working to release from prison the very people who had deposed him. This was contradictory, she said. \"\"On one hand they want to praise him but on the other they are working to free those people who ousted him through the Reconciliation Bill.\"\" She reiterated her previously stated opposition to the release of coup-convicts, saying that if alive, her father would have preferred justice to take its course.\n\nGanilau was elected Chairperson of the Lau Provincial Council on 11 July 2011, succeeding her brother, Roko Tevita Uluilakeba Mara. She defeated Filipe Bole by 17 votes to 15, but resigned the next day in Bole's favour, apparently under pressure from the military-backed regime in Suva.\n\nGanilau was married to former National Alliance Party leader Ratu Epeli Ganilau, who is the son of the late Governor-General and President, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau. They have two sons and two daughters.\n"}
{"id": "2117471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117471", "title": "Brothers (1984 TV series)", "text": "Brothers (1984 TV series)\n\nBrothers is an American sitcom television series that originally aired on the cable network Showtime from July 13, 1984, to May 5, 1989, totaling 115 episodes. It was produced by Gary Nardino Productions, in association with two separate divisions of Paramount Pictures: first by Paramount Video (1984–86) and by Paramount Television (1987–89). The show focuses on the three Waters brothers.\n\nDavid Lloyd, Greg Antonacci and Gary Nardino respectively created and developed \"Brothers\" in 1982, with the same format as what made it to the air. Lloyd, a veteran TV writer known for his work on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", \"Taxi\" and the then-new NBC sitcom \"Cheers\", had the premise for this series suggested to him by his employers, TV producers Ed. Weinberger and Stan Daniels. Wishing to develop a new screenplay with a revolutionary theme, Lloyd took to Weinberger and Daniels' idea about exploring familial relationships with the presence of a major—and controversial—life change, that of a relative finally coming out and addressing his homosexuality. Lloyd fully developed the idea and assumed full creation credit for the project. He then partnered himself with current Paramount Television president Nardino, who was looking to form an independent production company (he would leave Paramount in July 1983 to form Gary Nardino Productions), and Antonacci, a young actor-turned-director and producer, to write a pilot script with a modern, relevant point of view. The relationship of three adult brothers, inseparable and living in a world strongly underscored by masculinity, who soon have to confront the youngest brother's decision to be openly gay, quickly came to fruition in the screenplay aptly titled \"Brothers\".\n\nThe project was originally shopped around to broadcast networks NBC and ABC, in hopes of being picked up for the 1983 fall television season. NBC agreed to screen the pilot due to Lloyd's work on \"Taxi\" and \"Cheers\" (both of which had aired on NBC during the 1982–1983 season), and due to the insistence of Weinberger and Daniels. The network suits (then headed by Brandon Tartikoff) saw the charm of the content, but were concerned about how homosexuality was going to be portrayed. NBC did put \"Brothers\" in the running of fall 1983 pilots, but ultimately passed on it, instead choosing a series from Weinberger, \"Mr. Smith\", in its place. Lloyd, Antonacci and Nardino then offered \"Brothers\" to ABC, who instantly shot it down because of its dealings of gay themes. The creative team refused to give up hope on the project, and the same was said for its three leads, which from the beginning were Robert Walden (fresh off his Emmy Award-winning role of Joe Rossi on CBS' \"Lou Grant\"), Paul Regina and Brandon Maggart. As the producers tried to find a new outlet to pitch it to, development was put on hold, allowing Regina to co-star in CBS' short-lived \"Zorro and Son\" (1983), and Maggart to assume a role on NBC's \"Jennifer Slept Here\" (1983–1984).\n\nEventually, Lloyd and company were approached by Showtime, who at the time had successfully begun to venture into the new field of original pay-cable TV series. In 1983, the channel had been the first in history to revive a canceled network series for original cable broadcasts, with \"The Paper Chase\" (which originally ran on CBS in 1978-1979). Showtime's mission was to produce and pick up original programming that was outside the boundaries of standard network TV fare, and saw \"Brothers\" perfectly fitting that mold. Both parties struck a deal that had its cast paid at the same rate as network stars, with a full out 26-episode order from the start. Fortunately, Lloyd didn't have to scramble around to recast two of his stars, since Regina and Maggart both saw their series get canceled, so his original choices were back in place. With the series' premiere in the summer of 1984, Showtime now boasted one more first — the first original situation comedy on cable TV.\n\nSaid Robert Walden of his experience working on Showtime, \"There are fewer cooks in the kitchen, and the writers have more freedom. There's also something to be said for playing to 5 million or 6 million viewers instead of 30 million. You're reaching a higher common denominator.\" Since Nielsen Media Research had not yet adapted its ratings system to measure audience levels on premium cable, Showtime relied on qualitative research rather than sheer statistical reports. \"We have research firms that do telephone interviews with our subscribers,\" explained Peter Chernin, a Showtime programming executive. \"They call people and ask them how much they like particular shows. We also take into account the opinions of our local affiliates. All of them rated \"Brothers\" very highly.\"\n\nUnlike the policies set at rival HBO, who had no intention of preparing any of their first forays into original series for syndication, Showtime had the market in mind as soon as they picked up \"Brothers\". Since \"Brothers\" had such a successful first season by pay-cable standards, channel execs announced two unprecedented moves in the spring of 1985: not only would \"Brothers\" have a renewal for 50 more episodes, but the series would begin airing episodes simultaneously in broadcast syndication that November. Showtime giving the series such a large vote of confidence with two-season renewal was so history-making that never had a broadcast network given a series such an expansive episode order after its freshman year.\n\nHBO criticized their competitor's decision over the early syndication airing of \"Brothers\", stating that they would never engage in such a practice with any of their original series. They felt it would destroy subscription rates and revenue if the public could watch one of their series for free on a local broadcast station, rather than pay monthly to view it on HBO. Showtime later recanted their 1985 syndication rollout for \"Brothers\", and then fought back by saying that their subscribers had a five-year head start on all their shows, which were all prepped for syndication and of which would enter it after those five years. Their defense also included the facts that the parent studios of their shows would continue to receive royalties from strong rerun performance in syndication, and that the latter market would attract higher-profile writers and directors to ensure a more quality production. The alternative, as Showtime put it, would be not prepping series for syndication and thus taking a gamble on a relatively unknown or untested creative team.\n\nAs premium cable found its way with successful original programming, HBO would follow suit in what Showtime realized all along concerning syndication, and both would find that concurrent airings of cable series on broadcast TV wasn't so risky. In 1988, Showtime made history once again when they struck a deal with the young Fox Broadcasting Company to begin airing their \"Brothers\" stablemate, the smash hit \"It's Garry Shandling's Show\", on Sunday nights in order to raise Fox's profile among the broadcast networks. Not only did \"It's Garry Shandling's Show\" fulfill its mission for Fox, but it actually increased interest in Showtime, and subscription rates benefited.\n\nSet in south Philadelphia, \"Brothers\" centered on the lives and relationships of the Waters brothers; oldest brother Lou (Brandon Maggart), a somewhat uncouth, but well-meaning construction foreman; middle brother Joe (Robert Walden), a retired placekicker for the Philadelphia Eagles and owner of a sports bar called \"The Point After\"; and the youngest brother, Cliff (Paul Regina), a sports journalism major and later, an aspiring chef.\n\nIn the premiere episode, Cliff shocks his family when he runs away from the altar on his wedding day. Instead of getting married, Cliff reveals to his family that he is gay.\n\nThe pilot and following episodes centered on the efforts of Joe and Lou coming to terms with Cliff's long-held secret of his true sexual orientation, with both coping in their own unique way. Joe, who was definitely more sensible and open-minded, didn't see Cliff's sudden declaration of homosexuality robbing any aspect of their relationship. Lou assured his baby brother \"Cliffie\" that he loved and respected him no matter what, but was convinced early on that what Cliff was feeling was just a phase, and came up with numerous efforts to \"cure\" him of being gay. Cliff's relationship with the both of them was part brotherly, but also that of fathers and son, since Lou and Joe had almost 20 years on Cliff (their mother died when Cliff was an infant, followed a few years later by their dad; Lou and Joe raised Cliff for the majority of his youth). He was very much independent minded, and kidded around with his brothers in the usual way siblings do, but at times looked to them for guidance and was very much overprotected by Lou and Joe.\n\nCliff, earnest, bright and very much determined to lead a fulfilled life now that he truly found himself, took many a stand on same-sex issues and discussions; throughout the first season, whenever a situation or argument ensued regarding his decisions in life, Cliff gave heartfelt statements on how proud and secure he was being his true self, and that nothing anyone could do could possibly change his inner desires. When the series began, he was still in college, majoring in sports journalism, while working part-time for Joe at \"The Point After\". Following Cliff's first failed attempt at marriage, he resumed splitting rent with Joe in his sleek uptown apartment.\n\nPhilip Charles MacKenzie played Cliff's out-and-proud new friend Donald Maltby, a successful writer/magazine editor whom Cliff sought out friendship with for advice and support in the time leading up to his coming out. During and after the fact, Donald continued to be Cliff's voice of reason as he learned to navigate his way around the LGBT world. It was an otherwise unlikely friendship, but Donald's fey, queen-like behavior versus the masculinity of Cliff never got in the way, surprisingly. Donald's womanly flamboyance always unnerved Lou, and caused some mild, but humorous friction between them. However, Donald always managed to get the last laugh on Lou with his sharp humor. He lived in a cozy loft apartment which was another common setting for the stories. Cliff and Donald sometimes frequented The Velvet Spike, a local gay club/bar.\n\nOther characters included Joe's teenage daughter Penny (Hallie Todd), who was becoming independent at a faster rate than Joe anticipated; and \"The Point After\" waitress, Kelly Hall (Robin Riker), who traded zingers with them all while acting as a mediator between the Waters brothers when necessary. Seen in sporadic guest appearances all through the series was Lou's long-time wife Flo (Carol Locatell), who only showed up whenever she and Lou were having some sort of marriage dispute. These were usually worked out within the space of a single episode, but their \"hot and cold\" behavior became one of the show's key running gags. Lou and Flo had three kids—Bucky, Flo, Jr. and Louella—who were originally all referred to and never seen. Bucky, however, would make the first of two guest appearances beginning in the second season, as played by John Putch. A seminary student, Bucky went on sabbatical from the ministry and paid his family a visit in the season two episode \"Father, Father\", and appeared again in the fourth season Thanksgiving episode, unexpectedly dropping into town to surprise everyone.\n\nOriginally, the storylines on \"Brothers\" were permeated with exclusively gay themes, as Cliff and Donald's dating exploits were featured, along with the heterosexual characters' involvement in such stories. This sprung forth the show's knack for providing a blurred line of differences between the mating habits and culture of both sexualities. Examples of topical gay stories included Cliff's casual intimate encounters with men and the points he still wanted to learn; Lou and Donald's efforts to infiltrate crooked local police officers who refused to help Cliff, when he was attacked by two homophobic men; Donald's coaching Joe into accurately convincing a former teammate that he was gay, in order to form a closer bond with the recently outed teammate; and in the second season, when Cliff landed a boyfriend in well-to-do Winston March III (guest star John Furey), who helped him become even more comfortable in his identity. Winston initiated a passionate kiss with him, at a function he hosted, in front of Cliff's entire family.\n\nStereotypes of both sexualities, both positive and negative, were for the most part avoided, and if they appeared, were not emphasized at the expense of comedy so they would not detract from the meaningful, character-driven dialogue. While a steep gay slant in the stories was present, they were not depicted only from the gay point of view; all characters' points of view in stories which explored sexuality shared the spotlight from episode to episode, sometimes shifting back and forth within a single episode. The series, as a result, was recognized as being clever and complex in this regard.\n\nHowever, after the first two seasons, the writers started to downplay the wall-to-wall gay stories in favor of ones that were neutral to homosexual/heterosexual overtones. Just as this took place, additional characters started entering their own long-term relationships, which were depicted in a more standard sitcom fashion without sexuality being the key topic in an episode. Also, with \"Brothers\" being a Showtime original series, the allowance of strong language was taken advantage of heavily during the first and second seasons. By season three, with Paramount Television serious about the show's future in reruns, the scripts were cleaned up as well over the concern that the constant editing of coarse dialogue (Joe's habitual exclaiming of \"son of a bitch\" and \"fuck\" and \"shit\" peppered in accordingly) would be bad for syndication and revenues.\n\nAt the start of the third season, Joe began dating a voluptuous beauty named Sam (Mary Ann Pascal), a very materialistic real estate agent who was not only content with the physical aspect of their relationship, but also out to reap the benefits of an ex-pro athlete's bank account. During their mating dance, Sam became another regular patron at \"The Point After\", where at times she found herself in competition with Kelly over practically everything. Penny, who had rapidly matured from a gentle, innocent high school senior to a wild, vivacious party girl with a punk hairdo, began working as a dancer at Girls, Girls, Girls & Beer, a local dance hall, during her sophomore year in college. Everyone else on the scene had mates that came and went, and Joe was no exception with Sam, as they were on-again, off-again for a while; while Sam chose not to play the field, Joe dated others. In the fourth-season premiere, perky, cultured Ann Marie Wagner (guest star Judith-Marie Bergan) showed up, as a girlfriend of Joe's who had been with him for six months. Joe and Annie decided to get married during the course of the episode, but after much meddling from a jealous Sam, and a discouraging ceremony speech from Donald (who presided over the restaurant ceremony), the two called it off. A few episodes later, Joe went into overdrive dating both Annie and Sam, but felt guilty; when he went to break the news to Annie that he had been playing her, she revealed that she had been cheating too, so the two parted ways mutually, leaving Sam, who encouraged an open relationship, as Joe's only romantic focus.\n\nIn time, Joe and Sam discovered that they had a whole lot more in common beyond money and status, and love blossomed. Kelly and Sam even learned to put their feuding aside, forming sort of a \"girls' club\" together with Penny and Donald. Meanwhile, Cliff, who graduated from college early in the fourth season, was on the verge on launching his journalism career with a local newspaper when he had an epiphany-–that he suddenly had the affinity for cooking—and announced to everyone that he was enrolling in culinary school. Joe, Lou, and especially Donald tried to save him for turning down the offer to work at the paper, but in the end, decided to throw caution to the wind after tasting Cliff's impressive tomato sauce. Later that year, after dating many young men on the fast track, aspiring yuppie Penny fell for none other than Jim Grant (Tommy Hinkley), a construction worker from Lou's company. Jim was actually from a very wealthy family, but loved the laborer's life better, resulting in his turning down the opportunity to helm his family's million-dollar enterprise in order to be truly happy. Their romance lasted a single season. It was also at this time that the youngest of Lou's kids, athletic teenage prodigy Louella (Yeardley Smith), became a regular.\n\nThe fourth-season finale saw \"The Point After\" get upgraded to a three-star establishment by a local Philadelphia food publication, and Joe quickly received an offer by another top restaurateur for a huge buyout of his place. During the celebration of the three-star news at Donald's, everyone was shocked at the offer given to Joe, and Kelly expressed her worry over losing her job. After a series of flashbacks chronicling memorable moments the cast had at \"The Point After\", Joe ripped up the papers granting its sale, and it was assumed as the episode came to an end that the gang would remain intact. However, as the fifth season began in June 1988, Kelly was no longer around (Robin Riker-Hasley had left the series). At this time, Sam, whom Joe had still been going steady with, revealed she was pregnant. Joe didn't take the news too well at first, since new fatherhood wasn't exactly in his game plan. Sam was dead set against abortion, and ended up giving Joe an ultimatum — either he opened up his mind to having a new family, or she left him to raise the child alone. Joe chose to stand by Sam, and the two rushed off to Las Vegas to tie the knot. Through the next few months he had many adjustments to make, but when their daughter, whom they named Caroline, was born in the December 2, 1988 episode, Joe was more than ready to embrace her. Lou, Cliff and Penny all shared the designation of being Caroline's guardian, in case anything ever happened to her parents. Baby Caroline (who was named after executive producer Gary Nardino's daughter) was played in her birth episode by boy and girl twins Charles and Cathryn Hacker, but for the remainder of the series, was played by Cathryn alone.\n\nAs Joe and Sam were busy adjusting to married life, as well as preparing to bring in the newest addition to the Waters family, Cliff found himself getting promoted to manager of \"The Point After\" while continuing in culinary school. On the side, he was gradually building his own catering business from scratch, at times joining his services in with the restaurant's catering in order to turn over larger profits. Penny found a new love interest in Mike Chandler (Timothy Williams), a suitor that Joe had an extremely hard time having around. Mike happened to be the lawyer hired by Penny's mother, Joe's ex-wife Janey (who was played in a 1985 guest appearance by Rebecca Balding, Walden's former \"Lou Grant\" co-star) to retrieve part of Joe's pro football salary that she had yet to receive as a part of her divorce settlement with him. During their legal dealings, Penny moved out of Janey's house when her mother remarried on a whim, and got her own studio apartment. She graduated from college the following spring, and was hired as a junior writer for a big-time advertising firm.\n\nOther developments included Donald's close brush with a career in Hollywood, when he was hired to meet with a veteran movie actress in hopes of writing her biography. After getting lost in all of Tinseltown's glitz and glamour, Donald decided on his own will that Philly was where he truly belonged, and hired a \"stringer\" writer to collaborate on the biography project so he could return home. In November 1988, Lou was promoted to project designer in the offices of the large corporation that now owned Santini Construction. He was bribed into taking the promotion to keep quiet about an increase in accidents happening down at the job sites, as a result of inferior conditions and materials the new company provided. Upon finding this out, Lou was faced with a moral dilemma, and ended up quitting after 28 years on the job. He worked many odd jobs to compensate for his loss of income, before Donald proposed a business deal in which he found homeowners who needed private renovating done by a craftsman of Lou's expertise. A local mansion renovation job put Lou on the map, allowing him to buy out Donald's share in the partnership so he could become a stand-alone private contractor. Also, after his own steady succession of casual intimate encounters and regular boyfriends, Cliff's valiant search for Mr. Right continued, with a lot of help and advice from his family and friends.\n\nA couple of special episodes dealt with one of Joe's former teammates coming out, then feeling forced to admit that he was HIV-positive. Bubba Dean (guest star James Avery) actually revealed to Joe in a first-season episode that he was gay and had been holding a long-time torch for him. Then in a second season appearance, out of his fear of potentially spreading the virus, Bubba drops the news of his HIV infection at a party thrown by Donald. Since HIV and AIDS were not widely known to most Americans at the time, this episode had Joe learning about HIV and AIDS to better understand what his friend was going through so that he could offer support, as well as educating the public about HIV and AIDS and dispelling the myths about those who had contracted it and how it could be contracted.\n\nAnother episode in this category occurred in the second season, when Cliff learned that Connie (guest star Wendie Jo Sperber), his former fiancée whom he stood up at the altar in the pilot episode (although she was not seen in the pilot), was paying him a surprise visit after having spent a year being depressed — and gaining a lot of weight as the result of it. Cliff hesitated in making contact with her, but due to everyone's prompting they finally met face to face, and had a lot of hard feelings to address.\n\nVeteran actress Billie Bird was the subject of a couple of two-parter episodes. Bird first appeared in the third season two-parter \"Whose 'Golden Years' Is It Anyway?\" (aired September 17 and 24, 1986), as Donald's Aunt Wilhelmina, who escapes to Philadelphia, and her nephew, when her family places her in a nursing home. Wilhelmina strikes up a friendship with Lou and ends up convincing him to keep her from being carted off back to the home; they promptly end up on the run without letting their family and friends know of their whereabouts. In the second part of this episode, an arrest warrant is brought out for Lou. Exactly a year later in season four, Wilhelmina shows up again in the two-parter \"Las Vegas Serenade\" (aired September 11 and 18, 1987), albeit through a VHS tape sent to Donald. It turned out to be her video will, which arrived with an urn of her ashes. Wilhelmina, in advance right before her death, set up an all-expenses paid trip to Las Vegas which the entire cast embarked on, with the exception of Kelly (Robin Riker began her temporary leave of absence with this episode). Donald and the gang were instructed by Wilhelmina to spread her ashes into the courtyard of the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino while in Vegas. The trip was shot on location, mostly at the latter resort, and featured cameo appearances by Paul Anka and Jerry Lewis.\n\nThe fifth-season episode \"L.A. Maltby\" (aired September 1988), in which Donald travels out to Hollywood for the job offer of a lifetime, was perceived to be an attempt at a \"Brothers\" spin-off starring Philip Charles MacKenzie, centering on Donald's new glitz-filled life and career on the West Coast. Since the Hollywood storyline concluded in the same episode, with Donald choosing to return to Philadelphia, it is presumed that removing such an integral character from \"Brothers\" would have hurt the show, which was already undergoing many changes that year (read above). Since it was announced several months later that production on the series would end after five seasons, it can also be figured that hiring a replacement comic foil, or \"contrast\"-type character to play off the show's leads, wouldn't have been worth casting, even for almost 20 more episodes of \"Brothers\".\n\nAfter premiering in July 1984, \"Brothers\" completed the run of its first season of 14 episodes in December of that year, with the now-popular \"Brothers Christmas Special\" (featuring guest star Andy García) serving as the season finale. Beginning in May 1985 and through the end of the 1987 season, Showtime usually ran new episodes of \"Brothers\" on a May to December season schedule, a common free-form timetable for any cable network. Each of the second through fourth seasons consisted of a 25 episode order with the final fifth season having the standard 25 episodes that other American series utilized.\n\nThe fifth season had its premiere moved up to June in 1988, and had its episodes spread out over the course of a year, with one or two new episodes airing each month. The pace of new episodes eased down during this season, first and foremost because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America Strike putting a halt to production during a portion of the season. After the strike ended, Showtime announced that \"Brothers\" was ending its run in 1989; episodes continued to air intermittently, since Showtime wanted a clear-cut five-year run while giving viewers enough to a chance to bid farewell to the series. The 25th episode of the fifth season, \"The Road Yet Taken\", was finally reached on May 5, 1989, and was the official series finale of \"Brothers\". Then, a few weeks later on June 1, a \"lost episode\" produced during season three entitled \"I Remember But I Don't Like It\" aired. The episode featured most of the season three regulars, including Robin Riker but sans Mary Ann Pascal, and focused on Lou and Donald's most severe disagreement yet. As the others tried to figure out why the two were so angry at each other, a clip montage of Lou and Donald's relationship through the first three seasons was featured. Showtime presumably felt that this lost episode also served as a tribute to one of the show's key elements—the association between Lou and Donald. Showtime continued to air \"Brothers\" repeats on its schedule through late 1989.\n\nFor the majority of its original run, \"Brothers\" had aired Wednesday nights at 8/7c on Showtime, with episodes from its current season being repeated in various late night slots during the week on the premium cable network's schedule.\n\n\nThe \"Brothers\" title theme was a jazzy, synthesized piece written by Marcus Barone, Joe Diamond and Gloria Nissenson, with opening vocals performed by Barone.\n\nAs the title sequence opens, videotaped exterior scenes of Philadelphia are shown one at a time as the show's title is spelled out, one letter at a time, across the screen. The title formation is set on a half-circular curve. During this, lead singer Barone has a conversation with two other men in preparation for them to sing the theme song with him. Apparently, they are supposed to be posing as the Waters brothers, to give viewers the illusion that they, and not the hired singers, are the ones harmonizing the tune. Following this, a chorus of \"shoop-do-wah\"s serve as a bridge between the dialogue and the main part of the song.\n\nThe opening credits featured an artistic montage of actual photos from Walden, Regina, and Maggart's childhood and young adult years (although the first photo of young Lou in the sequence was actually that of Brandon Maggart's son, Garett Maggart, when he was a baby). Also featured was 16mm film footage of young Paul Regina, labeled on a film strip in the sequence as \"Cliff, age 4 yrs\". This montage segued into a group photo of the Waters brothers in the current day, which in turn displayed singular portraits of them one at a time as their credits were given on screen. All cast member photos were set against a blue background. A time-lapsed animation version of the group photo then lifts up to reveal multiple photos of the brothers in various scenes from the show's set. From the pilot episode through the end of season three, Robin Riker and Hallie Todd's names were listed at the bottom of this section, while the pictures floated against a sky background.\n\nThe final part of the opening sequence is a videotaped scene of the Waters brothers, finishing their lip-syncing of the show's theme song in front of a candy store named \"Babe's\". For the first two seasons, \"and Philip Charles MacKenzie as Donald\" appeared during this scene, followed by creator and producer credits before the sequence faded. During the entire third season, a computerized blue background with a digital cut-out of MacKenzie appeared with his credit before cutting to the \"Babe's\" scene. Starting with the fourth-season premiere, the photos of Robin Riker (now credited as Robin Riker-Hasley) and Hallie Todd were featured for the first time over the floating pictures animation, flipping up one at a time, until the last photo is that of MacKenzie, who now appears in a proper portrait. The last three cast portraits were set in blue backgrounds to match those of Walden, Regina, and Maggart's. Also, from this point on, creator and producing credits no longer appeared in the opening's last scene.\n\nFor the eleven episodes of season four that Riker-Hasley did not appear in, her photo and credit were removed from the intro, with only Todd and MacKenzie showing up in the latter half. This short-lived version of the intro had the dark blue backgrounds removed from Todd and MacKenzie, revealing the natural light-blue backgrounds of their photos instead. For season four, episode twenty-five, which was Riker-Hasley's return to the show, as well as her last appearance, the intro that was used in season four, episodes one through fourteen returned. In season five, after Riker-Hasley's departure, Mary Ann Pascal's photo was added into the sequence, between Todd and MacKenzie. The latter three cast photos in general were all new (with Todd's and MacKenzie's updated from the season four versions), and featured more natural backgrounds in gray/light blue/white tones. They filled the entire screen, as the floating pictures animation was completely eliminated.\n\nThree different credit fonts were utilized on \"Brothers\" simultaneously. The opening sequence used orange-gold hued Collegiate font for the title and credits; a font famously associated with sports teams (as well as colleges and universities), it was used to represent the show's underlying image of masculinity—brotherhood, \"The Point After\", sports and Joe's past NFL glory. First and final scene production credits were set in Cooper Black font, orange during the first two and a half seasons, then in yellow from the middle of season three until the end (black shadowing was added at the start of season four). Closing credits all through the run appeared in thin yellow Helvetica, and were carded in groups over scenes from the current episode. An instrumental cut of the opening theme, dominated by saxophone, was used for the closing.\n\nUpon the show's fall 1989 debut in syndication, the opening title sequence was truncated so that the only visuals featured in the first half were the title formation over the scenes of Philadelphia, the single photos of Walden, Regina and Maggart, and the time-lapsed group photo of the Waters brothers. The theme itself began from the \"\"Gonna meet the family...\"\" line, and ran up to \"\"Where it counts, behind the scenes, we're brothers\"\" line when the time-lapsed family photo was reached. During the last three cast credits and ending scene, the song picked up from the \"\"Life is full of stress and strife...\"\" line and ran through the end, unedited.\n\n<onlyinclude>\n</onlyinclude>\n\n<onlyinclude>\n\n</onlyinclude>\n\n<onlyinclude>\n\n</onlyinclude>\n\n<onlyinclude>\n\n</onlyinclude>\n\n<onlyinclude>\n\n</onlyinclude>\n\n<onlyinclude>\n\n</onlyinclude>\n\n\nAll five seasons of the show were musically scored by Dan Foliart and Howard Pearl.\n\nFoliart composed scores for \"Home Improvement\" during its entire eight-year run (1991–99). In 1994, Robin Riker would join the cast of \"Home Improvement\" sister series \"Thunder Alley\", which Pearl scored for.\n\n"}
{"id": "2117473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117473", "title": "The Country Bears", "text": "The Country Bears\n\nThe Country Bears is a 2002 American family musical comedy film, directed by Peter Hastings, produced by Walt Disney Pictures, and based on the Disney theme park attraction \"Country Bear Jamboree\". The film stars Christopher Walken, Daryl Mitchell, Diedrich Bader (in a dual role), Alex Rocco, and Haley Joel Osment as the voice of Beary Barrington with the voice talents of Candy Ford, James Gammon, Brad Garrett, Toby Huss, Kevin Michael Richardson, and Stephen Root.\n\nIt was Disney's second theatrical film based on an attraction at one of its theme parks and the third overall film based on an attraction following the television film \"Tower of Terror\" (1997) and the theatrically-released \"Mission to Mars\" (2000). Its world premiere was on July 21, 2002, at the El Capitan Theater in Hollywood, California. After that, it was released to theaters nationwide on July 26, 2002, and was a box office bomb, grossing $18 million of its $35 million budget.\n\nThe Country Bears are an all-bear country rock band who have disbanded in 1991 after years of popularity. Beary Barrington, a large admirer of the band and a young preteen bear adopted and raised by a human family, feels disowned for being different. His adoptive father tells him that his family will love him unconditionally regardless, and that differences lead everyone to their purposes. But Beary's adoptive older brother, Dex, tells him the truth about his background.\n\nAngry, embarrassed and sad, Beary runs away from home in the middle of the night and ventures out to the Country Bear Hall, the former concert hall of the Country Bears. Beary learns from the property caretaker Big Al and the band's manager Henry Dixen Taylor that Country Bear Hall is threatened with destruction by greedy banker Reed Thimple. After many attempts to raise $20,000 to save Country Bear Hall, Beary suggests to Henry to hold a benefit concert and the two of them set out to reunite the group with the band's bus driver and drummer Roadie. Meanwhile, the Barringtons have enlisted police officers named Officer Cheets and Officer Hamm to find Beary.\n\nFirst, they approach Fred Bedderhead, the harmonica and electric bass player, who is working as a security guard on the set of pop singer Krystal's latest music video and agrees to return for the concert. Henry needs promotion and Beary suggests the group's former promoter Rip Holland whom Henry claimed had \"stolen\" the Country Bears from him. Henry phones Rip, who gladly agrees to promote the show. Fred then mentions a talent show history where they defeated an armpit musician named Benny Boggswaggle in a talent competition which caused Benny to angrily strike Zeb Zoober on the head with a chair. Meanwhile, Big Al is approached by Reed who learns about the Country Bears' plan and about Rip Holland promoting the show.\n\nNext, they approach the band's fiddler Zeb Zoober, who has spent all of his years drinking honey at the Swarming Hive Honey Bar restaurant and owes $500.00 to the owner named \"Cha-Cha\". Zeb wants to return, but cannot do so without paying his debt to the restaurant. Beary places a bet to let Zeb off the hook by beating the house band in a playoff. Zeb starts his performance off by sounding rusty, but warms up and eventually wins.\n\nMeanwhile, Officer Cheets and Officer Hamm approach Big Al for directions to where Beary went. Because Big Al does not mention that Beary is friends with them and has joined them, the officers think that the bears have kidnapped Beary.\n\nThey then approach Tennessee O'Neal, the one-string guitar player now a marriage counselor, who is very reluctant because he wants nothing more than to reconcile with his ex-girlfriend Trixie St. Claire, the band's keyboard player. After being chased by Officers Cheets and Hamm through a car wash, the Country Bears stop at a motel where Beary learns that Trixie St. Claire is performing at the motel's bar. Beary informs Tennessee about this and he goes in to reunite with her where they sing a duet together. She subsequently comes with the band to their reunion.\n\nThey finally head out to find Ted Bedderhead, the group's lead vocalist and guitarist. Ted is supposedly very wealthy now when they find a mansion where they learn from Elton John that Ted is still at the local country club working at the wedding. After Ted has the other Country Bears members leave, Fred eventually finds out that he is nothing more than a wedding singer. Ted is knocked unconscious by Fred-(who tries to convince him how important he means to the band, saying that they're a family) and forcefully dragged onto the bus. The Country Bears learn that Ted had been performing at weddings and birthday parties as he mentions that the \"gardener\" that they met was Elton John and that Ted rented a room over John's garage. Zeb claims Ted to be the reason for the band's disestablishment, but Ted claims that he held them together and that no one was grateful, as the other members were all busy letting their personalities and habits get in the way, citing Zeb's drinking, Tennessee's emotional outbursts, and Fred's immaturity. Beary reminds them that they claimed each other to be family, but Ted claims it to be meaningless publicity. Beary realizes the real meaning of family and returns home where he is happily reunited with his family.\n\nThe Country Bears read Beary's school essay about them, and they realize that Beary was right and decide that they must perform the gig. Reconciling with Beary, Ted insists that they allow him to join them during the concert. But Reed Thimple kidnaps the rest of the Country Bears and steals the bus. While holding them captive, Reed Thimple reveals to the Bears that he is really Benny Boggswaggle and is wreaking his vengeance on the Bears for stealing his one chance at fame. Beary, his family, and Ted use Beary's tracking device to track down and rescue the band, and they head to the concert together.\n\nWhen they arrive at Country Bear Hall, they discover that Reed Thimple has paid Rip to not promote the show, so the concert appears to be headed for failure. Big Al suddenly arrives and reveals, to everyone's surprise, that he promoted the show himself, and had everyone parked in the back field (because he did not want any automobiles out on the front lawn). Big Al then opens the doors and a surge of people rush in, as a defeated Reed Thimple is thrown out of the building by the crowd while vowing to the Country Bears that their feud is not over. The money raised from the concert is revealed to be enough to save the hall, and the Country Bears perform with Beary as a new member of the band, as the rest of the Barringtons and the audience watch the concert.\n\n\n\n\nSome of the puppeteers made cameos in the movie;\n\n\nThe animatronic bear suits used in the film were created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop.\n\nIt was filmed in Franklin, Tennessee as well as various locations in California.\n\nThe original music was composed by Christopher Young, and the songs were written by Brian Setzer, John Hiatt, Jimmy Tittle, Krystal Harris and Bela Fleck.\nBudgeted at US$35 million, it grossed $16,990,825 in the US and an additional $1,021,272 overseas. The film was released on DVD and VHS on December 17, 2002. Though filmed in 1.85:1 widescreen, Region 1 DVDs present the film in full screen only though Region 2 and 4 present the film in widescreen.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a rating of 29% based on 82 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10. The site's consensus states: \"Despite all the celebrities on hand, this spin-off from a theme park attraction still feels tired and hokey.\" Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a two out of four stars and said, \"the formidable technical skills in \"The Country Bears\" must not be allowed to distract from the film's terminal inanity.\" Emma Cochrane of \"Empire Magazine\" gave the film a two out of five stars and said, \"Too American, too country, too much like a slick, band extension cash-in, \"Country Bears\" hovers between cult video hit and utter rubbish, never being compelling either.\"\n\nChristopher Walken was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor for his performance in the film, but lost to Hayden Christensen for \"\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2117474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117474", "title": "Constitution of North Carolina", "text": "Constitution of North Carolina\n\nThe Constitution of the State of North Carolina governs the structure and function of the state government of North Carolina, one of the United States; it is the highest legal document for the state and subjugates North Carolina law. All U.S. state constitutions are, according to the United States Supreme Court, subject to federal judicial review; any provision can be nullified if it, in the view of a majority of the Justices of the Supreme Court, constituted from time to time, conflicts with the US Constitution or any federal law pursuant to the Constitution, even if the identical language was previously upheld as valid by the court. \n\nThe first North Carolina Constitution was created in 1776 after the American Declaration of Independence. Since the first state constitution, there have been two major revisions and many amendments. The current form was ratified in 1971 and has 14 articles.\n\nThe three constitutions North Carolina has had are:\n\n\nThrough its history, North Carolina has had three Constitutions: the Constitution of 1776, the Constitution of 1868, and the Constitution of 1971.\n\nThe Fifth North Carolina Provincial Congress ratified the first constitution in December 1776. This draft was not submitted to a vote of the people, but was accompanied by a Declaration of Rights. Although the constitution affirmed the separation of power between the three branches of government, the General Assembly held the true power. Until 1836, the General Assembly members were the only state officials who were elected by the people. The General Assembly picked Judges, the Governor and the members in the Council of State. Judges had life terms and governors had a one-year term. The Governor had little power and in many cases needed the consent of the Council of State to exercise the power that the office did hold. The Governor was also held to strict term limits; a person could only hold the office three terms in every six years. The constitution established a judicial branch, but did not well define this branch's structure. The constitution also lacked a system of local government. Universal suffrage was not an element of this constitution. Only landowners could vote for Senators until 1857. To hold state office required land ownership until 1868.\n\nDissatisfied with the central role of the General Assembly, a state constitutional convention was called in 1835. Out of the convention came many amendments. Among those changes was fixing the membership of the Senate and House at their present levels, 50 and 120. Also, the office of Governor became popularly elected. These changes gave the more populous western counties more of a say in government but still favored those who owned property, since this was required to vote and hold office. The vote was taken away from freed slaves in this convention. The convention approved the changes on July 11, 1835. The convention's proposed changes were adopted by vote of the people on November 9, 1835.\n\nThe Convention of 18611862 was called to revise the constitution to remove North Carolina from the United States. The procedure used to amend the constitution did not need a vote of the people, a procedure that was active until removed in 1971.\n\nIn 1865, Governor William W. Holden called for a Conference to write a new Constitution; it was rejected by a popular vote. Two years later, they reconvened. The new Constitution gave more power to the people and to the governor. \"For its time, it was a progressive and democratic instrument of government.\" Akin to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, also adopted in 1868, it was product of the winning side in the Civil War: the (anti-slavery) Republicans and a few scalawags. \"It was highly unpopular with the more conservative [white supremacist, Democratic] elements of the state.\"\n\nFrom 1869 through 1968, there were submitted to the voters of North Carolina a total of 97 propositions for amending the Constitution of the State. All but one of these proposals originated in the General Assembly. Of those 97 amendment proposals, 69 were ratified by the voters and 28 were rejected by them. Due to the many amendments, many provisions in the constitution became antiquated, obsolete, and ambiguous. The document had simply become difficult to read and interpret. By 1971, there were 200 state agencies.\n\nThe draft that later became the Constitution of 1971 began with a study into needed changes by the North Carolina State Bar in 1967. The study outlined a vastly improved and easily ratifiable document. The draft constitution logically organized topics and omitted obviously unconstitutional sections. The language and syntax was also updated and standardized. The study separated from the main document several amendments that it felt were necessary, but were potentially controversial. The main document passed the General Assembly in 1969 with only one negative vote in seven roll-call votes. On November 3, 1970, the proposed Constitution of 1971 was approved by a vote of 393,759 to 251,132.\n\nSince the Constitution of 1971, there have been over twenty amendments. The majority of these amendments extend the rights of citizens, or extend the government the ability to issue bonds. One notable exception was in 2012, when an amendment was added to prevent recognition of same-sex marriage. The following are significant amendments made since the 1971 constitution:\n\nArticle III, Section 11 of the North Carolina Constitution, approved by voters on November 3, 1970, required the legislature to reduce the more than 300 administrative departments, agencies, and offices to no more than 25 principal administrative departments by 1 July 1975. This law lead to the creation of 19 principle offices or departments, including the 10 members of the North Carolina Council of State, elected by the voters (governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state auditor, state treasurer, superintendent of public instruction, attorney general, and commissioners of agriculture, labor, and insurance) and the nine member North Carolina Cabinet departments headed by secretaries selected by the governor, and (since 2017) consented to by the Senate.\n\nThe current North Carolina Constitution contains a Preamble and 14 articles. Each of the articles covers a different area, with the last article including all miscellaneous topics. Each article is further divided into sections. This constitution incorporates amendments into the document, unlike the United States Constitution which only appends amendments.\n\n\"We, the people of the State of North Carolina, grateful to Almighty God, the Sovereign Ruler of Nations, for the preservation of the American Union and the existence of our civil, political and religious liberties, and acknowledging our dependence upon Him for the continuance of those blessings to us and our posterity, do, for the more certain security thereof and for the better government of this State, ordain and establish this Constitution.\"\n\nEach of the 37 sections of Article I outline a separate recognized right. Many of the sections give more depth to the rights covered by the Bill of Rights. The state constitution also secures additional rights, for example the right to a public education and to open courts. Also of note, this section specifically denies the state the ability to secede from the United States and declares that each \"citizen of this State owes paramount allegiance to the Constitution and government of the United States.\" Section 38, added in 2018, is the newest addition to this article. This section declares the right to hunt and fish.\n\nArticle II declares that all legislative powers in North Carolina are given to the General Assembly. The General Assembly consists of a Senate and a House of Representatives, with 50 and 120 members, respectively. Guidelines for the formation of voting districts and qualification for office are also covered. Each house has a term of three years.\nThis article also gives the governor the power to veto public bills, defined as bills affecting more than 15 counties, in most circumstances. Veto power was denied the governor until 1996 when the constitution was amended. North Carolina was the last state to extend this power to its governor.\n\nThe governor is vested with all executive authority in Article III. The duties of the governor are defined as is the process of succession, should the governor die or become incapacitated. Holders of the governor office are limited to two consecutive terms. The Council of State, a cabinet-like body, is filled with eight popularly elected officials, in addition to the governor and lieutenant governor. This article also defines and mandates a balanced budget.\n\nArticle IV defines the make-up the judicial branch of the state and prohibits the legislature from inhibiting its function. Similar to the federal government, the power to impeach state officials and judges, in the cross-hairs, are given to the state House of Representatives. The Senate can remove a person from office with a 2/3 majority vote after an impeachment. This article also deals with the necessary qualifications of a judge and confers the power of judicial review with the state's Supreme Court.\n\nArticle V gives the state government the right to tax its citizens unlimitedly under certain guidelines. It authorizes an up to 7% income tax and also limits the ability to issue public bonds.\n\nArticle VI provides every person who is at least 18 years, an American Citizen, living within North Carolina, and (beginning in 2019, when in-person) has a voter ID the right to vote. This right is denied to felons (when any part of a felony sentence, including probation, is active) and people illiterate in English.\nThis article also sets the eligibility to hold office. To hold an elected state office a person cannot fall in any of the following categories:\n\nArticle VII gives the general assembly the power to define the boundaries of governmental subdivisions (counties, towns, cities). It limits the distance of newly incorporated town or cities from established cities based on the established city's population, subject to a waiver by 3/5 absolute majority. The office of sheriff is provided for each county.\n\nArticle VIII defines corporations. It also gives the General Assembly the right to create and regulate corporations.\n\nArticle IX makes public education compulsory for all able-bodied children, \"unless educated by other means.\" The North Carolina State Board of Education is defined here and given the power to regulate all \"free public education\" in the state. This article demands that the General Assembly establish a system of higher education and states that higher education should be free, \"as far as practicable.\"\n\nArticle X prevents the forced sale of a person's primary residence to pay for a debt, unless the house was specifically used as collateral for a loan. Females are also able to maintain full ownership of all property they own when they marry, under this article. Also, life insurance policies that are paid to a spouse or child are exempt from claims of debt from the estate of the deceased.\n\nArticle XI describes the only punishment methods to be used by the state. It specifically only allows the death penalty in cases of \"murder, arson, burglary, and rape.\" This article gives the responsibility of the public welfare to the General Assembly.\n\nThis short article states: \" The Governor shall be Commander in Chief of the military forces of the State and may call out those forces to execute the law, suppress riots and insurrections, and repel invasion.\"\n\nArticle XIII describes the two ways the constitution may be amended: by popular convention or through legislation. Legislation is the most common way to amend the constitution. The last time the constitution was amended by convention was in 1875. In a legislative action, an amendment must pass by three-fifths in both houses of the General Assembly and also obtain a majority of a popular vote.\n\nThe final article of the constitution covers topics not under other articles. Topics of sections in this article include:\n\nAs per the Federal Supremacy Clause, all Federal law and the Constitution of the United States overrule the North Carolina Constitution. There are several provisions in the current North Carolina Constitution that may conflict with federal law or the US Constitution.\n\nAt least two provisions are not enforced either because they are known to be void or would almost certainly be struck down in court, even though they were carried over verbatim from the 1868 Constitution.\n\n\nIn addition, federal and state court decisions have narrowed the scope of at least two sections of the constitution. Article 2, sections 3 & 5, sub-section 2 state that counties must not be divided when drawing state legislative districts. This provision is known as the \"Whole County Provision.\" However, in 1981, the federal Justice Department ruled that this provision was inconsistent with the Voting Rights Act. The state thus ignored the Whole County Provision until 2002. That year, the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that the state constitution's equal protection clause presumed single-member districts and was thus a limitation on the Whole County Provision. It can also be argued that the \"one person, one vote\" rule from \"Reynolds v. Sims\" also limits this provision.\n\nSection 2 of Article 11 (\"Death Punishment\") limits executions to \"...murder, arson, burglary, and rape[.]\". Per Kennedy v. Louisiana the last three are inapplicable.\n\nNorth Carolina Amendment 1's declaration to not recognize same-sex marriages is contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117476", "title": "Drumkeeran", "text": "Drumkeeran\n\nDrumkeeran () is a village in County Leitrim, Ireland located at the junction of the R280 and R200 roads. It is situated in drumlin hills at the foot of Corry Mountain, just north of Lough Allen.\n\nThroughout at least the 19th and 20th centurys, a number of annual fairs were held at Drumkeeran on- 10 February, 8 March, 12 April, 27 May, 18 June (or 24th), 19 July, 18 August, 16 September, 19 October, 11 November, 9 December, and 22 December. In 1925, Drumkeerin village comprised 54 houses, 11 being licensed to sell alcohol.\n\nLong ago Ireland had been covered in Woodland, a claim echoed in a 19th century survey of Leitrim- \"\". These great forests in Leitrim and on the west side of Lough Allen were denuded for the making for Charcoal for Iron works around Slieve Anierin.

{"id": "2117477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117477", "title": "Oberst", "text": "Oberst\n\nOberst () is a military rank in several German-speaking and Scandinavian countries, equivalent to Colonel. It is currently used by both the ground and air forces of Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, and Norway. The Swedish rank \"överste\" is a direct translation, as are the Finnish rank \"eversti\" and the Icelandic rank \"ofursti\". In the Netherlands the rank \"overste\" is used as a synonym for a lieutenant colonel.\n\nOberst (short: O) is the highest staff officer rank in the German Army (\"Heer\"), German Air Force (\"Luftwaffe\").\n⇒ Article: Ranks of the German Bundeswehr\n⇒ Article: Rank insignia of the German Bundeswehr\n\nThe rank is rated OF-5 in NATO, and is grade A16 or B3 in the pay rules of the Federal Ministry of Defence. It is comparable in NATO to OF-5 and equivalent to:\n\nOn the shoulder straps (Heer, Luftwaffe) there are three silver pips (stars) in silver oak leaves.\n\n\"Oberst\" is a German word. Spelled with a capital O, \"\"Oberst\"\" is a noun and defines the military rank of colonel or group captain. Spelled with a lower case o, or \"\"oberst\"\", it is an adjective, meaning \"top, topmost, uppermost, highest, chief, head, first, principal, or supreme\". Both usages derive from the superlative of \"ober(e)\", \"the upper\" or \"the uppermost\".\n\nAs a family name, \"Oberst\" is common in the southwest of Germany, in the area known as the Black Forest (\"Schwarzwald\"). The name is also concentrated in the north-central cantons of Switzerland (Aargau & Zürich). Here the Swiss version of \"Oberst\" is spelled \"Obrist\". The name first appeared in the thirteenth century in the German-Swiss border area, and early forms were \"Zoberist\" and \"Oberist.\" The name most likely refers to the \"tribe that lives the highest on the mountain\" or \"the family that lives the highest in the village\".\n\nTranslated as \"superior\" or \"supreme\", the rank of \"Oberst\" can trace its origins to the Middle Ages where the term most likely described the senior knight on a battlefield or the senior captain in a regiment. With the emergence of professional armies in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, an \"Oberst\" became the commander of regiment or battalion-sized formations.\n\nBy the eighteenth century, \"Obersten\" were typically afforded aides or lieutenants, often titled \"Oberstleutnant\". This led to formation of the modern German rank of the same name, translated as lieutenant colonel. The rank of \"Oberst\" is equivalent to that of colonel in English-speaking armies, although its more accurate meaning of \"supreme\" refers to the fact that \"Oberst\" is the highest-ranking officer below general officers.\n\n\"Oberst\" was used in the militaries of Germany and Austria during both World Wars. \"Oberst\" was also used as the prefix of the now obsolete SS rank of \"Oberstgruppenführer\". The SS \"Standartenführer\" was equivalent to an \"Oberst\". A colonel general during the World Wars was called \"Generaloberst\". Again, rather than literally meaning colonel general, its more accurate translation is \"supreme general\" as it was normally the highest peacetime military rank.\n\nThe rank of \"Oberst\" is known in American cinema, since several popular movies (such as \"The Great Escape\", \"Stalag 17\", \"The Eagle Has Landed\", \"Hart's War\", \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", and \"Live Free or Die Hard\") have featured characters holding the rank. Luftwaffe Colonel Klink of the television series Hogan's Heroes was a caricature of such a character.\n"}

It describes the structure and function of the state's government. The current constitution took effect on December 4, 1895. South Carolina has had six other constitutions, which were adopted in 1776, 1778, 1790, 1861, 1865 and 1868.\n\nA new constitution was required for readmission to the Union after the Civil War. A new constitution was ratified at a convention September 27, 1865, but its reforms were limited — black people still could not vote — so it was rejected by the U.S. Congress.\n\nA constitutional convention met in Charleston, January 14, 1868. For the first time, black men participated in the election of delegates to the convention. It is the only constitution in the history of the state submitted directly to the electorate for approval; many whites refused to participate. The United States Congress ratified it on April 16, 1868.\n\nThe constitution ignored wealth and based representation in the House strictly on population. It abolished debtors' prison, created counties, gave some rights to women, and provided for public education. The popularly-elected governor could veto and a 2/3 vote of the General Assembly was required to override. Race was abolished as a condition for suffrage. Black codes were overturned, there was no prohibition on interracial marriage, and all public schools were open to all races. It provided a uniform system of free public schools, \"although not implemented until decades later.\"\n\nBefore the 1895 Constitution, voter registration limits were lower; voting was open to all males of 21 years. In the 1895 Constitution, the focus of voter registration became one of \"intelligence\" instead of \"personhood.\" Individuals would, until January 1, 1898, have to be able to answer questions about any constitutional provision asked in order to qualify as a voter. Thereafter, the registration process included a test of reading and writing; individuals with at least $20 in property were also permitted to vote. The change from the 1868 constitution's \"personhood\" to the 1895 constitution's \"intelligence\" was due to the 1895 constitution's framers' desire to disenfranchise African Americans in order to bar them from participation in the political process. According to the state's Democratic Party-leaning newspapers, the motivations behind changing the constitution were clear:\n\nThe 1895 Constitution has been rewritten article by article on an ongoing basis since 1968, with each proposed revision submitted to the voters for approval. Prior to 1968, the 1895 Constitution had been amended 330 times, making it one of the longest state constitutions in the United States. It had become a somewhat chaotic document, in large part because most of the amendments dealt with matters addressed by statute in most other states.\n\nThe great majority of these amendments dealt with bonded debt limits for local governments. Originally, changes in the bonded debt limits for counties could only be adopted by a statewide vote.\n\nArticle XVI, Section 1 requires constitutional amendments to be approved by two-thirds of each house of the legislature, approved by the people in an election, and then ratified by a majority of each house of the legislature. If the legislature fails to ratify the amendment, it does not take effect even though it has been approved by the people.\n\nSome provisions of the Constitution of South Carolina have conflicted with the U.S. Constitution and the U.S. Supreme Court has had to resolve the constitutionality of some provisions of the former document. For example:\n\nSome provisions of the Constitution of South Carolina are antiquated and reflect the morals of an earlier era. For example, Article XVII, Section 3 of the Constitution prohibited divorce for any reason. On April 15, 1949, it was revised to permit divorce for certain reasons. It is believed that South Carolina is the only state in which the grounds for divorce are written into the constitution. The legislature is thus prohibited from creating additional grounds for divorce except by constitutional amendment.\n\nOther provisions of the Constitution of South Carolina are unique in certain respects:\n\n\n\n"}

It is situated 6 km east of Carrick-on-Shannon on the River Shannon and is located off the N4 National primary route which links Dublin and Sligo. The harbour dates to 1817 and was a hive of commercial waterway activity until the more northern navigation canal to Carrick-on-Shannon was opened in 1850. Today, the waterway is busy with anglers and tourist pursuits in the summer months.\n\nOne ancient way of crossing a river was swimming - \"ag Snámh\" in Irish.\n\nThe oldest known name for Drumsna is \"Snamh-Rathainn\", appears in the Irish Annals at 1148AD. Its mentioned again at 1261AD when the \"fortress\" of Hugh O’Conor, king of Connacht, at \"Snamh-in-redaigh\" was burned. John O'Donovan authoritatively states its \"probably Drumsna, on the Shannon, on the borders of Leitrim and Roscommon”.\n\nIn 1552AD Ferdorcha MagRaghnaill of Muintir Eolais was the Irish chieftain over Drumsna.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Drumsna was the main trading town in Leitrim with its own jail and courthouse. It was the resting place for horse-drawn carriages and the harbour was a thriving delivery port. In 1850, the construction of the Jamestown Canal led to a change of the Shannon navigation which altered the status of Drumsna.\n\nThroughout at least the 19th and 20th centuries, a number of annual fairs were held at Drumsna on- May 20, June 22, August 25, October 7, and December 13. There was a Chalybeate Spa near the village in the 19th century. In 1925, Drumsna village comprised 35 houses, 5 being licensed to sell alcohol.\n\nAshfort House, near Drumsna, was originally the home of the Caulfield family. It was purchased by the Waldrons of Cartron in 1744. It was here in January 1848 that Hubert Kelly Waldron JP was murdered in a non-political incident when the local coroner attempted to serve him with a writ.\n\nUntil 1996 the main N4 Dublin to Sligo road passed through the village which was then bypassed.\n\nIn the 19th century the skull of a small ancient Irish elk was found in the Shannon, at Drumsna Bridge.\n\nThe unpolluted lakes and rivers in the Drumsna area support a huge population of wild fish, and it is a base for angling. Coarse fish species include bream, roach, rudd, hybrids, tench, pike, perch and eels.\nThe Shannon flows through the village and there are several good fishing lakes close by. The Shannon has bream, rudd, roach, tench, perch and pike. Lough Aduff just outside the village is home to bream, roach and tench. Headford is a small lake located about 1½ mile north east of the village of Drumsna, this lake has a stock of bream to and some good tench fishing can be had here, especially during the summer months.\n\nBuilt in 1845 and part financed from the proceeds of a trip to Rome by the then Parish Priest, Father George Geraghty, the building has one of the largest church bells in the country. The church also contains a statue to the Virgin Mary which was the only surviving item from Belmount House when it was destroyed by fire.\n\nDrumsna railway station opened on 1 September 1863, and finally closed on 17 June 1963.\n\nDrumnsa lies beside the River Shannon with its own jetty. It is a common stopping point for boats though navigation for cruisers is not possible upstream of here. Boats are required to use the Albert Lock and Jamestown Canal which links to the Shannon upstream of Jamestown, County Leitrim.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is situated on the Shannon-Erne Waterway and R209 road and under Sheebeg (Sí Beag), an ancient pagan burial site which overlooks Lough Scur to the north and Keshcarrigan Lough to the south. Keshcarrigan features in the writing of the novelist John McGahern who lived nearby.\n\nThe village of Keshcarrigan probably originates from ancient \"lake dweller\" human settlements of nearby Lough Scur and, in recent centuries, activities associated with Reynolds manor. In 1798, the French Army under General Humbert passed through on the way to eventual defeat at the Battle of Ballinamuck. Through the 19th and much of the 20th century, eleven market fairs were held at Keshcarrigan annually (see notes). These fair days are no longer extant, although the fair green in the centre of the village has been redeveloped into a small park. More recently, Keshcarrigan has become known for its alternative St. Patrick's Day parades which have included an invisible parade (marshaled by an invisible Pamela Anderson), an indoor parade (in Gertie's pub) and a walking backwards parade.\n\nAbout 1 km west of Keshcarrigan on the road to Carrick-on-Shannon there is a collapsed dolmen overlooking Lough Scur. Medieval ruins of Castle John and Jail Island are located near the village, at Lough Scur. In 1854 a Bronze Age gold artifact which became known as the 'Keshcarrigan Bowl' was discovered in the waterways between Lough Scur and Lough Marrave, north of the village.\n\nIn the 2011 census the Keshcarrigan area had 472 residents (from 270 in 2001). The village experienced dramatic changes in the early 21st century with over 100 new houses being built mainly as a result of a controversial government tax incentive scheme (Section 23).\n\nAbout 1km south of the village on the road to Mohill, a small park on the shores of Keshcarrigan Lough is dedicated to the memory of Mychal Judge, chaplain of the New York Fire Department and the first recorded victim of the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. Fr Judge's ancestral home was opposite the park.\n\nThe main local sports club is Kiltubrid GAA. The senior men's team were Leitrim Senior Football Champions in 2005 and the senior women's team in 2015 and 2016. The latter also went on to contest Connacht finals in both those years.\n\nThere are a number of angling centres near Kesh, including Lough Scur, Keshcarrigan Lough, Carrickaport Lough and the Shannon–Erne Waterway.\n\nLaheen Estate and Letterfine House (built c.1800) near Keshcarrigan are associated with the Reynolds (Lough Scur) and Peyton families, prominent local landowners who had intermarried in the early 18th century.

She was first portrayed by Laura Wright for an eight-year period, followed by Nicole Forester until the character's departure in 2008.\n\nCassie was originally named \"Danni Shayne\". The character of Cassie was originated by actress Laura Wright in the summer of 1997, barring a two-day leave in January 2001 (in which Laura Stepp filled in), and until her final appearance in November 2005. Soon afterward, Nicole Forester took over the role of Cassie in November 2005, continuing to play her through November 2008. Cassie has two children, a daughter named Tammy and a son named R.J.\n\nCassie's entrance onto the canvas was part of an \"retcon\" storyline where the audience learned that Reva Shayne's mother Sarah had a child out of wedlock. After Sarah's death, Reva searched for her sister and briefly believed it was her archenemy Annie Dutton. She eventually learned it was Cassie, and the two sisters developed a relationship after Cassie moved to Springfield.\n\nCassie gave birth to a stillborn child before adopting Will with Richard. She would then discover that she was still fertile when Edmund and herself suffered a surprise miscarriage in 2004. In early 2005, Cassie and Edmund decided to try to conceive via IVF but when she found out about Edmund's involvement in the Jessup barnfire that would have taken R.J.'s life had he not been rescued (by Dinah Marler, ironically), she separated from Edmund and found solace in her friendship with Jeffrey O'Neill. Desperate for a child with Cassie, Edmund took up on Dinah's offer to be a surrogate mother for Edmund. When Cassie found out about Edmund's deception, she kicked him out of the house and took in her archrival instead. She would later break up with Edmund officially when she saw him holding a shovel over Dinah's head when the latter faked an abduction (with help from Jonathan Randall).\n\nIn June 2005, Dinah revealed to Jonathan that she'd miscarried Edmund and Cassie's child weeks ago when he found an apparatus in her room that she had been using to simulate pregnancy. Cassie had no idea that Dinah was no longer with child, though the latter had revealed this to Edmund, who convinced her to continue the charade. In a stunning plot twist, Edmund hatched a plan to dupe both Cassie and Michelle Bauer by stealing Michelle Bauer's baby, passing it off to Cassie as their baby, and telling Cassie that Dinah, whom he had locked up, had run off after giving birth.\nAfter the death of her daughter Tammy in 2007 and her marriage and then divorce from ex-brother-in-law Josh Lewis resulting from her brief and disastrous affair with Cyrus Foley and her adopted troubled son Will being sent away to reform school, Cassie moved to Hawaii with her son RJ to start a new life near the end of 2008.\n\nCassie has been married 5 different times. Her first husband was Rob Layne whom Cassie divorced a year after her arrival in Springfield, in 1998. After the murder of her fiancé Hart Jessup, Cassie married Prince Richard Winslow in 2000 on a strictly business arrangement. It would be agreed that Cassie would give the San Cristoballian Republic a legitimate heir to the throne in exchange for Prince Richard aiding her in her financial troubles. However, after it was discovered that Rob Layne hadn't signed divorce papers, her marriage to Prince Richard was ruled invalid. After Cassie successfully divorced Rob, she remarried Prince Richard whom she remained with until his death 2 years later. Cassie would later married Prince Richard's brother Ambassador Edmund Winslow from December 2004 to November 2005 and to her former brother-in-law, Joshua Lewis. Cassie is currently living in Hawaii with her son R.J. living off her own income from the salvage of the Beacon Hotel.\n\n"}

It is , with in Routt National Forest and in White River National Forest. It was designated a wilderness area in 1975. Trappers Lake, located in the north of the area, was the lake that inspired Arthur Carhart, a United States Forest Service official, to plead for wilderness preservation.\n\nThe Chief of the U.S. Forest Service designated of the Routt and White River national forests as the Flat Tops Primitive Area on March 4, 1932, to be managed to protect the area’s wild values.\n\nCongress passed the Wilderness Act in 1964, which, among other things, required the Secretary of Agriculture to review the suitability of all primitive areas for inclusion into the national wilderness system within ten years. Following this mandate, the U.S. Forest Service evaluated the Flat Tops primitive area and surrounding forest and in 1967 recommended 142,230 acres for wilderness designation.\n\nConflict arose over the inclusion in the wilderness proposal of lands adjacent to the South Fork of the White River, near the southwest boundary of the proposed wilderness. Several private and public entities proposed dams and water diversions on the South Fork to facilitate development of rich oil shale deposits to the west. Timber interests also initially opposed designating wilderness outside the primitive area’s boundary.\n\nConservation groups, led by the Colorado Open Space Coordination Council and including Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society, Defenders of Wildlife, and the National Audubon Society, supported protecting a much larger, 230,000-acre area that included lower elevation forest and lakes outside the primitive area.\n\nOn June 5, 1975, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by U.S. Senator Floyd Haskell (D-Colo.) to designate 235,230 acres as the Flat Tops Wilderness Area. The bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a vote of 369-1 on December 1, 1975, and was signed into law by President Gerald R. Ford on December 12, 1975. The lands protected as wilderness included the contested lands along the South Fork of the White River, effectively prohibiting the contested dam construction there.\n\n"}

The word \"farina\" is Latin, meaning meal or flour and the Italian word for flour. It is made from wheat middlings: the germ and endosperm of the grain, which are milled to a fine consistency and then sifted.\n\nFarina is often prepared as hot cereal (porridge). It may also be cooked like polenta and farofa. Farina with milk and sugar is sometimes used for making creams for layered cakes. Farina can be used as a substitute for bread crumbs in sweet and meat pies (to absorb excess water). It can also be used to prevent dough from sticking to baking surfaces via the baking process, leaving residual farina on the bottom of the final product.\n\nFarina is a carbohydrate-rich food. When enriched, it is one of the best sources of dietary iron available, especially for vegetarian diets. Popular brands offer up to 50% of the recommended daily value of iron in a single 120-calorie serving. In commercially available farina the bran and most of the germ are removed. Cream of Wheat, Malt-O-Meal, and Farina Mills are popular brand names of breakfast cereal. To augment its mild taste, popular add-ins to cooked farina include brown sugar, maple, honey, nuts, cinnamon, butter, grated chocolate, jams, and salt.\n\n"}
{"id": "2117543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117543", "title": "The Old Man and the Lisa", "text": "The Old Man and the Lisa\n\n\"The Old Man and the Lisa\" is the twenty-first episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> eighth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 20, 1997. In the episode, Mr. Burns goes bankrupt and asks Lisa to help him get rich again. She agrees on the condition that he change his evil ways. They earn money by recycling cans and soon Burns has enough money to start his own recycling plant. Lisa is aghast when she learns the plant makes a slurry from liquefied sea creatures. When Burns sells the plant to a company which makes fish sticks, he offers Lisa 10 percent of his profits, but she declines for ethical reasons.\n\nThe episode was directed by Mark Kirkland and written by John Swartzwelder. The writing staff had thought about an episode in which Mr. Burns would lose his money and would have to interact with the outside world. In DVD commentary, the writers explained that while Mr. Burns tried to change, he \"couldn't help being himself\". Professional wrestler Bret Hart made a cameo as himself, animated in his pink wrestling outfit. \"The Old Man and the Lisa\" contains cultural references to the television series \"That Girl\" and the film \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\". It was positively received by critics and won the Environmental Media Award for \"TV Episodic Comedy\".\n\nLisa collects recyclables to earn money for the Junior Achievers Club school trip to Albany. Mr. Burns speaks to the club at Springfield Elementary School, scoffing when Lisa suggests his nuclear power plant start a recycling program. When Burns boasts that he would not be filthy rich if he listened to nature lovers like her, Lisa counters that his net worth is only half what he claims. When pressed, Smithers reluctantly tells Burns he has even considerably less money than that.\n\nBurns soon realizes he is nearly broke because his sycophantic advisers tell him only what he wants to hear. He is oblivious to the 1929 stock market crash, neglecting to check his stock ticker since September 1929. He aggressively invests in blue chip stocks, but makes bad investments and goes bankrupt. The bank forecloses on the plant — putting Lenny in charge — and sells his mansion to pro wrestler Bret Hart.\n\nBurns moves in with Smithers and insists on doing his grocery shopping. At the supermarket he is confused by the difference between ketchup and catsup, so the grocer commits him to the Springfield Retirement Castle. He sees Lisa again at the nursing home and begs her to help rebuild his empire. She agrees to help him earn money by recycling after he promises to change his evil ways.\n\nBurns grabs every can he finds, eventually earning enough money to open his own recycling plant. He gives Lisa a tour of the plant, showing her the Burns Omni-Net — millions of six-pack holders fastened together to catch fish and sea creatures to make Li'l Lisa's Patented Animal Slurry. Lisa, a vegetarian and animal rights supporter, realizes he has not changed; when he tries to be good, he is even more evil. Lisa runs through the streets, trying to stop seemingly brainwashed citizens from recycling.\n\nLater Burns tells Lisa that he has sold the recycling plant to a fish stick company for US$120 million, 10 percent of which is hers. Lisa refuses the money and rips up the check. This causes Homer to have four simultaneous heart attacks. At the hospital, Lisa apologizes to her dad for forfeiting the money. When he tells her that $12,000 would have been a godsend, Lisa tells him 10 percent of $120 million is actually $12 million. The hospital's public address system announces a code blue, indicating Homer has suffered cardiac arrest.\n\nThe episode was based on a story idea pitched by David X. Cohen, although it was written by John Swartzwelder, who had written many of the \"Simpsons\" episodes that have environmental themes. This habit led to him being called the \"conscience of the staff\" despite being a \"self declared anti-environmentalist.\" It was because of this that he was given such episodes, because the staff felt that he would give them just the right amount of sarcasm. In the original script for the episode, he described the recycling center as \"a couple of hippies surrounded by garbage\". Two alternate original titles for the episode were Cohen's \"Lisa and Burns\" and Swartzwelder's \"Burns Goes Broke\".\n\nThe writers had wanted an episode where Burns becomes bankrupt and shows what Burns would be like as a person in the real world. The idea with the recycling plant was that Burns did not have any sort of evil plan, he just could not help being himself. Burns really was trying to change and this was reflected in the end when he tried to give Lisa her share of the profits, with Lisa refusing. Burns was drawn without his trademark scowl for this episode. The staff joked about this being a suitable series finale, due to the episode ending with Homer suffering from another heart attack after Lisa tells Homer what 10% of Burns' $120,000,000 ('��')check really is.\n\nProfessional wrestler Bret Hart guest starred in the episode as himself, and he was very insistent that he be shown wearing his pink wrestling outfit. He explained that \"It's so cool to be part of a show that makes people laugh really, really hard.\" The media, aware that the animated Hart would want to purchase Mr. Burns' home, mistakenly anticipated that \"Bret offers to wrestle him [Mr. Burns] for the place.\" In a 2009 interview with the A.V. Club's Dave Hofer, Hart explained that the reason why his animated counterpart sounds nothing like him was that initially, he was brought in to voice a generic wrestler. When Mark Kirkland realised how famous Hart actually was, he told Hart that if the artwork had not been started yet, he would be drawn in as himself. Later, Hart moved on to do voice work on the animated television series \"Jacob Two-Two\". The press noted that at that time Hart was \"no stranger to cartoon-land,\" having been \"immortalized\" by \"The Old Man and the Lisa\".\n\nMr. Burns's walk through the supermarket was based on a false rumor that George H. W. Bush visited a store and was confused by the scanner and, in the original draft for the episode, Burns met Bush while shopping there. When bidding farewell to the hippie, Mr. Burns says \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", a reference to the Pink Floyd song of the same name. The hippie responds by saying that Burns needs to stop living in the past. The voice of the hippie is based on the character played by Dennis Hopper in \"Apocalypse Now\". \"Achy Breaky Heart\", a song by Billy Ray Cyrus, is played at the old folks' home. The scene where Mr. Burns chases Lisa through the town is a spoof of the opening to the television series \"That Girl\". The scene where Lisa runs through the streets proclaiming recycling as evil, spoofs the finales of \"Soylent Green\" and the original version of \"The Invasion of the Body Snatchers\".\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"The Old Man and the Lisa\" finished 38th in ratings for the week of April 14–20, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 8.3, equivalent to approximately 8.1 million viewing households. It was tied along with \"King of the Hill\" as the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-files\" and \"Melrose Place\".\n\n\"The Old Man and the Lisa\" received the 1997 Environmental Media Award in the \"TV Episodic Comedy\" category. \n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", called it \"An odd episode with a not-too-unexpected outcome. The best bits are undoubtedly Burns learning his way around a supermarket and Lisa's realisation of what Burns has been up to.\"\n\n"}

Featuring lyrics written by frontman Chris Cornell and music written by guitarist Kim Thayil, \"Hands All Over\" was released in 1990 as the second single from the band's debut full-length studio album, \"Louder Than Love\" (1989). It also appeared on the band's EP \"Loudest Love\", released in 1990. The song was included on Soundgarden's 1997 greatest hits album, \"A-Sides\" and appeared on the band's compilation album \"Telephantasm\".\n\n\"Hands All Over\" features lyrics written by frontman Chris Cornell and music written by guitarist Kim Thayil. The song is in the key of D major. Thayil on the song:\nWhat I liked about the song was that it was just one simple riff—one note, one chord—but with a lot of dynamics. In some ways it's simple and basic; in other ways, it's very sophisticated in how it was layered. We don't really have many songs that are like \"Hands All Over\".\n\nRegarding \"Hands All Over\", Cornell said that \"it's just sort of an environmental thing. Not strictly environmental, but mostly. It's basically about how we humans tend to screw up everything that's good enough as it is ... or everything that we're attracted to, we love to go and defile it.\"\n\nThe single for \"Hands All Over\" marked the beginning of Soundgarden having cover versions as B-sides. The B-side to the single is a cover of The Beatles song \"Come Together\". Producer Jack Endino provided the backing vocals on the song. This was also the last time that Soundgarden recorded with him. Outside the United States, the single was released commercially in Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nDue to some of the lyrics contained in the song (most notably the \"kill your mother\" line), this song and \"Big Dumb Sex\" led to the band facing various retail and distribution problems upon the release of \"Louder Than Love\". Tom Maginnis of AllMusic called \"Hands All Over\" a \"walloping behemoth of a track\". He said, \"The song combines an Eastern-tinged rock riff in an extended arrangement, as singer Chris Cornell airs out his impressive lung capacity while lyrically taking a stab at environmental politics.\" J. D. Considine of \"Rolling Stone\" said that the song \"applies swooping bass and jazzily vigorous drumming to counterbalance the static intensity of the song's bone-simple guitar hook.\"\n\nBoth the song and video were featured in the 1990 film \"Pacific Heights\", but the song was not included on the film's soundtrack.\n\nThe music video for \"Hands All Over\" was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who had previously directed the \"Loud Love\" music video for the band. The video was shot in a factory and features the band members swinging on equipment amid scenes of the band performing the song. Thayil described the video as \"one of the lamest ever made. It really sucked.\" Cornell added, \"Making this video was fun because we were in a steel foundry. And there was like a black cancer dust all over everything. We're all gonna get cancer from it and die. So I hope you enjoy it. This will be the video that killed Soundgarden.\" The video was released in January 1990. The video is available on the home video release \"Louder Than Live\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It lies in Dentdale, a narrow valley on the western slopes of the Pennines within the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It is south east of Sedbergh and about north east of Kirkby Lonsdale.\n\nDent was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire.\n\nThe origin of the name is debated. Older forms include \"Denet\" (1200). It may have been taken from the hill now known as Dent Crag (2,250 ft), to be compared with another hill named Dent near Cleator in Cumberland, in which case it would derive from a pre-English Celtic term related to Old Irish \"dinn, dind\" \"a hill\". Alternative derivations see the name preserving the memory of the dark age kingdom known in Latin as \"Regione Dunutinga\", founded and named after King Dunot the Great of the North Pennines.\n\nBoth place name and dialect evidence indicate that this area was settled by the Norse in the 10th century. Geoffrey Hodgson, in 2008, argued that this invasion accounts for the high frequency of the Hodgson surname in the area.\n\nDent was the birthplace of Thomas de Dent, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, in the early 14th century.\n\nDent was the birthplace of the geologist Adam Sedgwick in 1785.\n\nDentdale was one of the last Yorkshire Dales to be enclosed, Dent's Enclosure Award being made in 1859.\n\nWhilst fishing on the Dee at Dentdale in the 1840s, William Armstrong saw a waterwheel in action, supplying power to a marble quarry. It struck Armstrong that much of the available power was being wasted and it inspired him to design a successful hydraulic engine which began the accumulation of his wealth and industrial empire.\n\nDent, then in Yorkshire, was one of the sites for the Survey of English Dialects in the 1950s. A recording of the broadest local speech is available on the British Library's website.\n\nDent is part of the Westmorland and Lonsdale parliamentary constituency, of which Tim Farron is the current MP representing the Liberal Democrats.\n\nBefore Brexit for the European Parliament its residents vote to elect MEP's for the North West England constituency.\n\nThe Dent Brewery is an independent microbrewery in Cowgill, just above Dent.\n\nDent was the original site of the Dent Folk Festival and is now the site of the Dent Music and Beer Festival at the end of June. The first event was held in 2009 and was hailed as a great success.\n\nDent railway station on the Settle and Carlisle Railway is about above the village at Denthead. Despite its name, it is actually in Cowgill. Nearby, the railway goes over a viaduct. It is the highest mainline station in England at 1150 feet above sea level.\n\nThe long distance footpath the Dales Way passes through Dent, with various types of accommodation available to walkers.\n\nThe parish of Dent includes the whole of Dentdale and the side valley of Deepdale. In addition to the village of Dent settlements in the parish includes the hamlets of Lenacre, Gawthrop, Cowgill and Stone House.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117570", "title": "History of New York City (1946–1977)", "text": "History of New York City (1946–1977)\n\nImmediately after World War II, New York City became known as one of the world's greatest cities. However, after peaking in population in 1950, the city began to feel the effects of white flight to the suburbs, a downturn in industry and commerce as businesses left for places where it was cheaper and easier to operate, an increase in crime, and an upturn in its welfare burden, all of which reached a nadir in the city's fiscal crisis of the 1970s, when it barely avoided defaulting on its obligations and declaring bankruptcy.\n\nAs many great cities lay in ruins after World War II, New York City assumed a new global prominence. It became the home of the United Nations headquarters, built 1947–1952; inherited the role from Paris as center of the art world with Abstract Expressionism; and became a rival to London in the international finance and art markets. Yet the population declined after 1950, with increasing suburbanization in the New York metropolitan area as pioneered in Levittown, New York.\n\nMidtown Manhattan, fueled by postwar prosperity, was experiencing an unprecedented building boom that changed its very appearance. Glass-and-steel office towers in the new International Style began to replace the ziggurat-style towers (built in wedding-cake style) of the prewar era. Also rapidly changing was the eastern edge of the East Village close to FDR Drive. Many traditional apartment blocks were cleared and replaced with large-scale public housing projects. In Lower Manhattan, urban renewal began to take shape around 1960, led by David Rockefeller's construction of the One Chase Manhattan Plaza building.\n\nIn a built-out city, construction entails destruction. After the old Beaux Arts Pennsylvania Station was torn down, growing concern for preservation led to the 1965 Landmarks Preservation Commission Law. The city's other great train station, Grand Central, was also threatened with demolition but was eventually saved. Meanwhile, New York City's network of highways spread under the guidance of Robert Moses, with consequent increased traffic congestion, but the defeat in 1962 of Moses' planned Lower Manhattan Expressway by community activists led by Jane Jacobs was an indication that Moses would no longer have the free hand he had enjoyed in the past.\n\nDuring the '60s, a gradual economic and social decay set in. A symptom of the city's waning competitiveness was the loss of both its longtime resident National League baseball teams to booming California; the Dodgers and the Giants both moved after the 1957 season. A sports void was partially filled with the formation of the Mets in 1962, who played their first two seasons at the Polo Grounds, the former home of the Giants, before moving to Shea Stadium in Queens in 1964.\n\nThe passage of the federal Immigration Act of 1965, which abolished national-origin quotas, set the stage for increased immigration from Asia, which became the basis for New York's modern Asian American community.\n\nOn November 9, 1965, New York endured a widespread power blackout along with much of eastern North America. (The city's ordeal became the subject of the 1968 film, \"Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?\") The postwar population shift to the suburbs resulted in the decline of textile manufacturing and other traditional industries in New York, most of which also operated in extremely outdated facilities. With the arrival of container shipping, that industry shifted to New Jersey where there was more room for it. Blue-collar neighborhoods began to deteriorate and become centers of drugs and crime. Strip clubs and other adult businesses started filling Times Square in the late '60s.\n\nIn 1966, the US Navy decommissioned the Brooklyn Navy Yard, ending a command going back to the early 19th century. It was sold to the city. The Yard continued as a site for shipbuilding for another eleven years.\n\nJohn Lindsay, a liberal Republican, was a highly visible and charismatic mayor from 1966 to 1973. The city was a national center of protest movements regarding civil rights for black citizens, opposition to the Vietnam War, and the newly emerging feminist and gay movements. There were jolting economic shocks as the postwar prosperity came to an end with many factories and entire industries shutting down. There was a population transition with hundreds of thousands of blacks and Puerto Ricans moving in, and an exodus of whites to the suburbs. Labor unions, especially in teaching, transit, sanitation and construction, fractured over major strikes and internal racial tensions.\n\nThe Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) led by Mike Quill shut down the city with a complete halt of subway and bus service on mayor John Lindsay's first day of office. As New Yorkers endured the transit strike, Lindsay remarked, \"I still think it's a fun city,\" and walked four miles (6 km) from his hotel room to City Hall in a gesture to show it. Dick Schaap, then a columnist for the \"New York Herald Tribune\", coined and popularized the sarcastic term in an article titled \"Fun City\". In the article, Schaap sardonically pointed out that it was not.\n\nThe transit strike was the first of many labor struggles. In 1968 the teachers' union (the United Federation of Teachers, or the UFT) went on strike over the firings of several teachers in a school in Ocean Hill and Brownsville.\n\nThat same year, 1968, also saw a nine-day sanitation strike. Quality of life in New York reached a nadir during this strike, as mounds of garbage caught fire, and strong winds whirled the filth through the streets. With the schools shut down, the police engaged in a slowdown, firefighters threatening job actions, the city awash in garbage, and racial and religious tensions breaking to the surface, Lindsay later called the last six months of 1968 \"the worst of my public life.\"\n\nThe Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn, in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City. They are frequently cited as the first instance in American history when people in the homosexual community fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities, and they have become the defining event that marked the start of the gay rights movement in the United States and around the world.\n\nBy 1970, the city gained notoriety for high rates of crime and other social disorders. A popular song by Cashman & West in the autumn of 1972, \"American City Suite\", chronicled, in allegorical fashion, the decline in the city's quality of life. The city's subway system was regarded as unsafe due to crime and suffered frequent mechanical breakdowns. Prostitutes and pimps frequented Times Square, while Central Park became feared as the site of muggings and rapes. Homeless persons and drug dealers occupied boarded-up and abandoned buildings. The New York City Police Department was subject to investigation for widespread corruption, most famously in the 1971 testimony of whistle-blowing police officer Frank Serpico. In June 1975 a coalition of labor unions distributed a pamphlet to arriving visitors, warning them to stay away.\n\nThe opening of the mammoth World Trade Center complex in 1972, however, was one of the few high points of the city's history at that time. Conceived by David Rockefeller and built by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey on the site of the Radio Row electronics district in Lower Manhattan, the Twin Towers displaced the Empire State Building in Midtown as the world's tallest building; it was displaced in turn by Chicago's Sears Tower in 1973.\n\nUS economic stagnation in the 1970s hit New York City particularly hard, amplified by a large movement of middle-class residents to the suburbs, which drained the city of tax revenue. In February 1975, New York City entered a serious fiscal crisis. Under mayor Abraham Beame, the city had run out of money to pay for normal operating expenses, was unable to borrow more, and faced the prospect of defaulting on its obligations and declaring bankruptcy. The city admitted an operating deficit of at least $600 million, though the actual total city debt was more than $11 billion and the city was unable to borrow money from the credit markets. There were numerous reasons for the crisis, including overly optimistic forecasts of revenues, underfunding of pensions, use of capital expenditures for operating costs, and poor budgetary and accounting practices. The city government was reluctant to confront municipal labor unions; an announced \"hiring freeze\" was followed by an increase in city payrolls of 13,000 people in one quarter, and an announced layoff of eight thousand workers resulted in only 436 employees leaving the city government.\n\nThe first solution proposed was the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which tried to pool the city's money and refinance its heavy debts. It was established on June 10, 1975, with Felix Rohatyn as chairman, and a board of nine prominent citizens. In the meanwhile, the crisis continued to worsen, with the admitted city deficit reaching $750 million; municipal bonds could be sold only at a significant loss to the underwriters.\n\nThe MAC insisted that the city make major reforms, including a wage freeze, a major layoff, a subway fare hike, and charging tuition at the City University of New York. The New York State Legislature supported the MAC by passing a law converting the city sales tax and stock transfer tax into state taxes, which when collected were then used as security for the MAC bonds. The State of New York also passed a state law that created an Emergency Financial Control Board to monitor the city's finances, required the city to balance its budget within three years, and required the city to follow accepted accounting practices. But even with all of these measures, the value of the MAC bonds dropped in price, and the city struggled to find the money to pay its employees and stay in operation. The MAC sold off $10 billion in bonds.\n\nIt failed to achieve results quickly and the state came up with a much more drastic solution: the Emergency Financial Control Board (EFCB). It was a state agency, and city officials had only two votes on the seven-member board. The EFCB took full control of the city's budget. It made drastic cuts in municipal services and spending, cut city employment, froze salaries and raised bus and subway fares. The level of welfare spending was cut. Some hospitals were closed as were some branch libraries and fire stations. The labor unions helped out, by allocating much of their pension funds to the purchase of city bonds—putting the pensions at risk if bankruptcy took place.\n\nA statement by Mayor Beame was drafted and ready to be released on October 17, 1975, if the teachers' union did not invest $150 million from its pension funds in city securities. \"I have been advised by the comptroller that the City of New York has insufficient cash on hand to meet debt obligations due today,\" the statement said. \"This constitutes the default that we have struggled to avoid.\" The Beame statement was never distributed because Albert Shanker, the teachers' union president, finally furnished $150 million from the union's pension fund to buy Municipal Assistance Corporation bonds. Two weeks later, President Gerald R. Ford angered New Yorkers by refusing to grant the city a bailout. \n\nFord later signed the New York City Seasonal Financing Act of 1975, a Congressional bill that extended $2.3 billion worth of federal loans to the city for three years. In return, Congress ordered the city to increase charges for city services, to cancel a wage increase for city employees and to drastically reduce the number of people in its workforce. \n\nRohatyn and the MAC directors persuaded the banks to defer the maturity of the bonds they held and to accept less interest. They also persuaded the city and state employee pension funds to buy MAC bonds to pay off the city's debts. The city government cut its number of employees by 40,000, deferred wage increases already agreed in contracts and kept them below the level of inflation. The loans were repaid with interest.\n\nA fiscal conservative, Democrat Ed Koch, was elected as mayor in 1977. By 1977–78, New York City had eliminated its short-term debt. By 1985, the City no longer needed the support of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, and it voted itself out of existence.\n\nThe New York City blackout of 1977 struck on July 13 of that year and lasted for 25 hours, during which black and Hispanic neighborhoods fell prey to destruction and looting. Over 3,000 people were arrested, and the city's already crowded prisons were so overburdened that some suggested reopening the recently condemned Manhattan Detention Complex.\n\nThe financial crisis, high crime rates, and damage from the blackouts led to a widespread belief that New York City was in irreversible decline and beyond redemption. By the end of the 1970s, nearly a million people had left, a population loss that would not be recouped for another twenty years. To Jonathan Mahler, the chronicler of The Bronx is Burning, \"The clinical term for it, \"fiscal crisis,\" didn't approach the raw reality. \"Spiritual crisis\" was more like it.\"\n\n\n"}

In North America, the common name soft rush also refers to \"Juncus interior\".\n\n\"Juncus effusus\" is nearly cosmopolitan, considered native in Europe, Asia, Africa, North America, and South America. It has naturalized in Australia, Madagascar, and various oceanic islands.\n\nIt is found growing in wet areas, such as wetlands, riparian areas, and marshes. In the United Kingdom it is found in purple moor-grass and rush pastures and fen-meadow plant associations.\n\n\"Juncus effusus\" grows in large clumps about tall at the water's edge along streams and ditches, but can be invasive anywhere with moist soil. It is commonly found growing in humus-rich areas like marshes, ditches, fens, and beaver dams.\n\nThe stems are smooth cylinders with light pith filling. The yellowish inflorescence appears to emerge from one side of the stem about from the top. In fact the stem ends there; the top part is the bract, that continues with only a slight colour-band marking it from the stem. The lower leaves are reduced to a brown sheath at the bottom of the stem.\n\nFive subspecies are currently recognized:\n\n\"Juncus effusus\" can be differentiated from the rarer \"Juncus pylaei\" by the number of ridges on the stem. \"Juncus effusus\" has 30 to 40 ridges and \"J. pylaei\" has 10 to 20.\n\nThe species provides wildfowl, wader feeding, and nesting habitats, and also habitats for small mammals.\n\nA number of invertebrates feed on soft rush, including the rufous minor moth. The rootstalks are eaten by muskrats, and birds take shelter amongst the plant's stems.\n\nIn Hui sup tea, \"Juncus effusus\" is listed as one of the seven ingredients.\n\nIn Japan, this rush is grown to be woven into the covering of tatami mats. \n\nIn Iran and Afghanistan too it is used to weave light cheap mat. It is called halfa (حلفا) and has medicinal uses too.\n\nIn Europe, this rush was once used to make rushlights (by soaking the pith in grease), a cheap alternative to candles.\n\nThe species is cultivated as an ornamental plant, for planting in water gardens, native plant and wildlife gardens, and for larger designed natural landscaping and habitat restoration projects.\n\nThe cultivar \"Juncus effusus\" 'Spiralis' (syn. \"Juncus spiralis\"), with the common names corkscrew rush or spiral rush, is a distinctive potted and water garden plant due to its very curled spiral like foliage.\n\n\"Juncus effusus\" can become a naturalized or invasive species, undesirable in rangelands for its unpalatability to livestock. Suggested methods of controlling rushes include: ploughing; high applications of inorganic fertilizer (can pollute watersheds); and topping to prevent seed formation.\n\nJuncusol is a 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene found in \"J. effusus\". The plant also contains effusol and dehydroeffusol.\n\n"}
