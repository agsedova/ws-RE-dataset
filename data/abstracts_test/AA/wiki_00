In liturgical Christian churches, this feast of St. Mark is observed on 25 April of each year; thus St. Mark's Eve is 24 April.\n\nIt was the custom in villages in England, from the 17th century to the late 19th century, to sit in the church porch on St. Mark's Eve. Those sitting had to keep silent between the bell tolling at 11.00 p.m. until the bell struck 1.00 a.m. In Yorkshire it was necessary to keep vigil for three successive nights. On the third such sitting, it was said that the ghosts of those to die during the year would be witnessed passing into the church. This practice took place throughout England, but was most prevalent in northern and western counties.\n\nSome accounts of the custom state that the watchers must be fasting, or must circle the church before taking up position. The ghosts of those who were to die soon would be the first observed, while those who would almost see out the year would not be witnessed until almost 1.00 a.m. Other variations of the superstition say that the watchers would see headless or rotting corpses, or coffins approaching. Another tradition holds that a young woman can see the face of her future husband appear on her smock by holding it before the fire on St Mark's Eve.\n\n\n"}

The mountain is located in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness of White River National Forest, north by northeast (bearing 30°) of the community of Redstone in Pitkin County, Colorado, United States.\n\nMount Sopris is located in western Pitkin County, south of Carbondale and southwest of the confluence of the Crystal and Roaring Fork rivers. Mount Sopris is notable for having two summits, East Sopris and West Sopris, that are one-half mile (0.8 km) apart and have the same elevation of .\n\nIt is named for Richard Sopris, a former mayor of Denver and part of the first European expedition in the Roaring Fork Valley. In 2011 J.P. McDaniels petitioned to rename East Sopris \"Mount John Denver\" after the Colorado singer. A local poll in Aspen and Carbondale said 74 percent of the respondents were against the proposal.\n\nMount Sopris is believed to have been formed by an igneous intrusion 10,000 feet below the earth's surface, geologically referred to as a pluton, that occurred around 30 million years ago, after the initial uplift of the modern Rocky Mountains. Mount Sopris is not a volcano, but it is possible that an ancient volcano sat above it, with the current rock forming the magma chamber far below. Due to subsequent continued erosion, any evidence is now gone. In either case, the rock that makes up Sopris never reached the surface, cooling and crystallizing in situ, and later becoming exposed due to erosion. Nearby prominent peaks Mount Gunnison and Crested Butte are believed to have formed similarly. \n\nMount Sopris dominates the skyline of Carbondale and the lower Roaring Fork Valley, serving as an unofficial symbol of the area. It is prominently visible from State Highway 82 in the vicinity of Carbondale. In terms of local relief, it is one of the largest peaks in the state of Colorado. For example, West Sopris rises 6,400 ft (1,905 m) above the valley to the west in only 2.7 mi (4 km). (One can compare this to the corresponding vertical rise of the more well-known Maroon Peak in the heart of the Elks: it rises only about 4,300 ft (1,310 m), at best, in the same horizontal distance.) In fact a vertical rise of over 6,000 feet in less than 3 miles is rare and impressive anywhere in the contiguous United States.\n\nThe Mount Sopris Trail ascends to East Sopris via its east ridge. It starts near Dinkle Lake, on the northeast side of the mountain, and passes between the two Thomas Lakes just before reaching timberline. The ascent involves about 4,300 ft (1,300 m) of vertical gain (plus 600 ft/180 m for a round-trip to West Sopris, if desired) and 12 mi (20 km) of hiking (plus 1 mi/1.6 km for West Sopris); it is a strenuous trail hike, with some scree.\n\n\n"}

He is the father of political author Anthony Seldon.\n\nArthur Seldon was born Abraham Margolis in the East End of London to Masha and Pinhas Margolis. They came to Britain from Kiev fleeing the anti-semitic pogroms in 1903 or 1904. Abraham was probably born at Mrs Levy's Maternity Home, Petticoat Lane, near Aldgate, London. Masha and Pinchas Margolis were married in Kiev; he was probably born at Perioslav, a village near Kiev. The family were very poor: Pinchas worked making caps at a Jewish immigrant's factory called Goldstein & Co, Commercial Road, Stepney and, they lived at 12 Marks Street, Aldgate. It was not until after they moved to 13 Beeford Street, Stepney that Abraham was actually born. His oldest brother Jack was born in 1906, and a sister Bess in 1910; brothers Susman and Solly Margolis changed their names to Cecil Margolis and Sidney Margolis respectively; only Abraham changed his whole name. His mother Masha had two brothers Ben and Morris Kopelolt who had also come to London as refugees. When his parents both died in the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, his uncles families took the boys in, and then sent them away to school. Abraham was put up for adoption by a cobbler, Pinchas Slaberdain, and his wife Eva at 154 Oxford Street, Commercial Road, Stepney. Arthur Seldon never forgot where he came from, and the intense poverty that had shaped his family's arrival in this country. But rather than turning for help to socialism he worked hard, first at school, and then to get a tertiary education becoming self-reliant.\n\nAged only eight he remembered cheering on the Labour candidate for Stepney in the 1924 General election campaign. Abraham was educated at elementary school Sir Henry Raine's Grammar School. There in 1928 he was impressed by History master E J Hayward's interpretation of cottage industry's transition to capitalism. A scholarship paid for the London School of Economics where he read Friedrich Hayek, Arnold Plant and Lionel Robbins served to deepen his interest in classical liberalism. Friedrich Hayek's \"Road to Serfdom\" introduced him to Austrian economics. Seldon helped found the small university's student Liberal Society. Nonetheless he retained anti-fascist principles as war drew nearer.\n\nHe served with the army in North Africa and Italy during the war. Arthur married Marjorie in 1948, and continued to be involved with the Liberal Party. He was chairman of its committee on the elderly from 1948 to 1949.\n\nSeldon was working at the Brewer's Society in 1956 when approached by Lord Grantchester to be asked if he wanted to join a new 'Think Tank' just set up by Antony Fisher on the advice of Friedrich Hayek, founder of the Chicago School of economics and champion of free market neoliberalism. Seldon wrote a first pamphlet still only 20 years of age, called \"The Intellectuals and Socialism\" (1937) in which he criticised the keynesian state and its bureaucracy as \"second hand dealers in ideas.\" Ralph Harris was appointed General Director of the new Institute of Economic Affairs and Arthur was Editorial Adviser. Antony, later Lord Fisher left a legacy of think tanks that he had founded all around the world. \"The State Versus Market\" pamphlet was published when he was still only twenty years old, based on a book review, it explained the benefits of market competition.\n\nSeldon joined the Liberal Party. He was on a Committee of Enquiry chaired by Elliott Dodds into the distribution of property, exploring the idea of \"ownership for all,\" and the effects of statist maldistribution. In \"The Drift to Corporate State\" he severely criticised the corporatist industrial policy being against state monopoly. It was an idea endorsed by the Liberal Assembly ten years earlier in 1948. In another pamphlet in 1957, the IEA published \"Pensions in a Free Society\" commented freely on the Liberal Beveridge Report of 1942 into founding of the state pension system. Seldon generated editorial copy: edited recruited authors, made available titles to a wider audience. Pamphlets were of between 10,000 and 15,000 words and as such represented a new form of political literature. It was also Seldon's inspiration to produce series, such as Hobart Papers, Occasional Papers, and Readings etc.\n\nSeldon was also involved in the famous Orpington by-election in 1962, in which the Liberal Party gained the seat from the Conservative Party and weakened the confidence of the Macmillan administration. A neoliberal free marketeer, he influenced the policies of Margaret Thatcher.\n\nIn 1970 Seldon invited Milton Friedman at the IEA, quick to recognise the value of monetarist policy. The ideas imported from Chicago had a great influence on members of the Conservative party, especially Enoch Powell, Sir Keith Joseph, and Margaret Thatcher. Public Choice Theory analysed the relations between the State and voluntary activity. He organised a conference in 1978 called \"Economics in Britain\" – the American economist James Buchanan, founder of Public Choice was invited. In 1980 Seldon founded the IEA's \"Economic Journal\". Seldon gained a reputation as an exceptionally competent editor. He would, according to Ralph Harris, re-write poor pamphlets to such an extent as to almost become its co-author. In \"Vote Motive\" he found a voice that was most profound and influential, shaping the post-modern ethos for electioneering and party politics.\n\nSeldon won the Fisher Arts Literary Prize in 1991, although it was established by the founder of IEA, so nobody minded the eternal paradox, for his book \"Capitalism\". He received an honorary degree in 1999 from the University of Buckingham.\n\nArthur Seldon is the father of the historian Anthony Seldon.\n\nSeldon's widow Marjorie was interviewed about his work at the IEA and the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series \"Tory! Tory! Tory!\".\n\nAll publications from 1956 with the IEA unless otherwise stated:\n\n\n"}

Their product lines include electric and acoustic guitars, basses, guitar and bass amplifiers, effects units, USB audio interfaces and guitar/bass wireless systems. The company was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in Calabasas, California.\n\nLine 6 imports its products primarily from China. Since December 2013, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Yamaha Corporation.\n\nMarcus Ryle and Michel Doidic (two former Oberheim designers) co-founded Fast-Forward Designs, where they helped develop several notable pro audio products such as the Alesis ADAT, Quadraverbs and QuadraSynth, and Digidesign SampleCell. As digital signal processing became more and more powerful and affordable during the 1980s, they began developing DSP-based products for guitarists. As Ryle tells the story, the name \"Line 6\" came about because the phone system at Fast-Forward Designs only had 5 lines. Because the new guitar-related products were developed in secrecy, the receptionist used \"Line 6\" as a code word of sorts, and paging them for a call on Line 6 meant to stop any guitar or amp-related sounds so that they wouldn't be overheard by other Fast-Forward clients or callers.\n\nLine 6 launched in 1996, with their first digital-modeling guitar amplifier, the AxSys 212, a combo amp using one 2x12\" speaker. This was followed in 1997 by the Flextone. The company underwent a rapid expansion in the early 2000s (decade) due to the success of their \"Pod\" product line, which isolated modeling circuitry from the AxSys amplifier.\n\nDigital modeling attempts to recreate the unique characteristics of musical instruments and pro audio gear. Early Line 6 products used digital modeling to emulate the signature tone of a guitar amp/speaker combination. Further development of Line 6's modeling technology has extended the emulation to include numerous guitar amplifier / guitar cabinet combinations, guitar effects, microphones, and even different guitars and other fretted instruments themselves. Digital modeling offers countless virtual combinations of a variety of music gear, but only as emulations, however convincing as they may be.\n\nThough Line 6 began with a modeling guitar amp, their breakthrough product line was arguably the POD guitar processor line and its later variants, but this modeling technology has been the foundation for most of Line 6's products, from guitar amps to software and computer audio interfaces. Line 6 has an active user community, and provides software that allows users to easily download and share patches or device settings for many of Line 6's products.\n\nIn early 2008, Line 6 acquired X2 Digital Wireless, who had introduced digital wireless systems for guitar. Further developing this technology, Line 6 developed and introduced a family of digital wireless microphone systems in 2010.\n\nIn December 2013, it was confirmed that Line 6 was to be bought by Yamaha Corporation, to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary with the internal management remaining the same.\n\nLine 6 produces a number of guitar amplifiers (combos and heads), all featuring amplifier modeling software. In 2004, the Spider II 112 combo amp was released. The Spider III sold over 12,700 units in 2011, the 15-watt Spider IV amp was the best-selling guitar amplifier in America. As of this time, they've launched the Spider IV, which has also been the best-selling 15, 30, 75, and 120 watt amp, according to their website.\n\nPedal boards range from Pod amp modelers to modeling pedals for delay and other effects, as well as a jam looper. In 2015 Line 6 announced their 'next generation' multi-effects processor/ pedalboard named Helix, similar in function to the Floor Pod and Pod Live series, but with a redesigned interface and body.\n\nThe BackTrack and BackTrack+Mic are portable recording devices for electric and acoustic guitars, respectively.\n\nThe earlier audio interface produced by Line 6, GuitarPort, is replaced by the TonePort line. POD amp modelers are available in a number of versions.\n\nVariax is a line of acoustic, bass and electric guitars. Some of the original development team members for the first Variax model introduced in 2002 moved on to other companies, including Damage Control USA and Vox Amplification Ltd.\n\nLine 6 software includes the Variax Workbench, a software application that can interface a home computer with a Variax electric guitar; the Gearbox, tone editing software; and Pod Farm, which contains all of the modeling features of the POD X3 emulated on the computer.\n\nIn May 2008, Line 6 announced it had acquired X2 Digital Wireless; it now sells wireless systems for guitar, bass, vocals and wind instruments.\n\nLine 6 products were placed in \"Guitar Hero World Tour\". Line 6 guitar and bass amplifiers can be found on stage. In the \"Guitar Hero World Tour\" \"Music Studio\", gamers can use a stylized Line 6 POD to create their own songs.\n\n"}
