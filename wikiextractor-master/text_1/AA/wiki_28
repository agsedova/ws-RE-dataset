{"id": "1824778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1824778", "title": "Atlas V", "text": "Atlas V\n\nAtlas V is the fifth major version in the Atlas rocket family. It is an expendable launch system originally designed by Lockheed Martin, now being operated by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture between Lockheed and Boeing.\n\nEach Atlas V rocket consists of two main stages. The first stage is powered by a Russian RD-180 engine manufactured by RD Amross and burning kerosene and liquid oxygen. The Centaur upper stage is powered by one or two US RL10 engine(s) manufactured by Aerojet Rocketdyne and burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. AJ-60A strap-on solid rocket boosters (SRBs) are used in some configurations and will be replaced by GEM-63 SRBs in the near future. The standard payload fairings are 4 or 5 meters in diameter with various lengths.\n\nThe Atlas V was developed by Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services (LM CLS) as part of the US Air Force Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program and made its inaugural flight on August 21, 2002. The vehicle operates from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Space Launch Complex 3-E at Vandenberg Air Force Base. LM CLS continued to market the Atlas V to commercial customers worldwide until January 2018, when ULA assumed control of commercial marketing and sales.\n\nThe Atlas V first stage, the Common Core Booster (CCB), is 12.5 ft (3.8 m) in diameter and 106.6 ft (32.5 m) in length. It is powered by a single Russian RD-180 main engine burning 627,105 lb (284,450 kg) of liquid oxygen and RP-1. The booster operates for about four minutes, providing about 4 meganewtons (860,000 lbf) of thrust. Thrust can be augmented with up to five Aerojet strap-on solid rocket boosters, each providing an additional 1.27 meganewtons (285,500 lbf) of thrust for 94 seconds.\n\nThe Atlas V is the newest member of the Atlas family. Compared to the Atlas III vehicle, there are numerous changes. Compared to the Atlas II, the first stage is a near-redesign. There was no Atlas IV.\n\nThe main differences between the Atlas V and earlier Atlas I and II family rockets are:\n\nThe Centaur upper stage uses a pressure-stabilized propellant-tank design and cryogenic propellants. The Centaur stage for Atlas V is stretched 5.5 ft (1.68 m) relative to the Atlas IIAS Centaur and is powered by either one or two Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10A-4-2 engines, each engine developing a thrust of 99.2 kN (22,300 lbf). The inertial navigation unit (INU) located on the Centaur provides guidance and navigation for both the Atlas and Centaur and controls both Atlas and Centaur tank pressures and propellant use. The Centaur engines are capable of multiple in-space starts, making possible insertion into low Earth parking orbit, followed by a coast period and then insertion into GTO. A subsequent third burn following a multi-hour coast can permit direct injection of payloads into geostationary orbit. , the Centaur vehicle had the highest proportion of burnable propellant relative to total mass of any modern hydrogen upper stage and hence can deliver substantial payloads to a high-energy state.\n\nAtlas V payload fairings are available in two diameters, depending on satellite requirements. The 4.2 meter diameter fairing, originally designed for the Atlas II booster, comes in three different lengths: the original 9-meter-long version and extended 10-meter and 11-meter versions, first flown respectively on the AV-008/Astra 1KR and AV-004/Inmarsat-4 F1 missions. Fairings of up to 7.2 m diameter and 32.3 m length have been considered but were never implemented.\n\nA 5.4 meter diameter fairing (4.57 meters internally usable) was developed and built by RUAG Space in Switzerland. The RUAG fairing uses carbon fiber composite construction and is based on a similar flight-proven fairing for the Ariane 5. Three configurations are manufactured to support the Atlas V: 20.7 m, 23.4 m, and 26.5 meters long. While the classic 4-meter fairing covers only the payload, the RUAG fairing is much longer and fully encloses both the Centaur upper stage and the payload.\n\nMany systems on the Atlas V have been the subject of upgrade and enhancement both prior to the first Atlas V flight and since that time. Work on a new Fault Tolerant Inertial Navigation Unit (FTINU) started in 2001 to enhance mission reliability for Atlas vehicles by replacing the existing non-redundant navigation and computing equipment with a fault-tolerant unit. The upgraded FTINU first flew in 2006, and in 2010 a follow-on order for more FTINU units was awarded. Later in the decade, the FTINU was replaced with avionics common to both the Atlas V and Delta IV.\n\nProposals and design work to human-rate the Atlas V began as early as 2006, with ULA's parent company Lockheed Martin reporting an agreement with Bigelow Aerospace that was intended to lead to commercial private trips to low Earth orbit (LEO).\n\nHuman-rating design and simulation work began in earnest in 2010, with the award of in the first phase of the NASA Commercial Crew Program (CCP) to develop an Emergency Detection System (EDS).\nAs of February 2011, ULA had received an extension to April 2011 from NASA and was finishing up work on the EDS.\n\nNASA solicited proposals for CCP phase 2 in October 2010, and ULA proposed to complete design work on the EDS. At the time, NASA's goal was to get astronauts to orbit by 2015. Then-ULA President and CEO Michael Gass stated that a schedule acceleration to 2014 was possible if funded.\nOther than the addition of the Emergency Detection System, no major changes were expected to the Atlas V rocket, but ground infrastructure modifications were planned.\nThe most likely candidate for the human-rating was the N02 configuration, with no fairing, no solid rocket boosters, and dual RL10 engines on the Centaur upper stage.\n\nOn 18 July 2011, NASA and ULA announced an agreement on the possibility of certifying the Atlas V to NASA's standards for human spaceflight. ULA agreed to provide NASA with data on the Atlas V, while NASA would provide ULA with draft human certification requirements. In 2011, the human-rated Atlas V was also still under consideration to carry spaceflight participants to the proposed Bigelow Commercial Space Station.\n\nIn 2011, Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) picked the Atlas V to be the booster for its still-under-development Dream Chaser crewed spaceplane. The Dream Chaser was intended to launch on an Atlas V, fly a crew to the ISS, and landing horizontally following a lifting-body reentry. However, in late 2014 NASA did not select the Dream Chaser to be one of the two vehicles selected under the Commercial Crew competition.\n\nOn 4 August 2011, Boeing announced that it would use the Atlas V as the initial launch vehicle for its CST-100 crew capsule. CST-100 will take NASA astronauts to the International Space Station and was also intended to service the proposed Bigelow Commercial Space Station. A three-flight test program was projected to be completed by 2015, certifying the Atlas V/CST-100 combination for human spaceflight operations. The first flight was expected to include an Atlas V rocket integrated with an uncrewed CST-100 capsule, the second flight an in-flight launch abort system demonstration in the middle of that year, and the third flight a crewed mission carrying two Boeing test-pilot astronauts into LEO and returning them safely at the end of 2015. These plans did not materialize.\n\nIn 2014, NASA selected the Boeing CST-100 space capsule as part of the CCD program after extensive delays. Atlas V is the launch vehicle of the CST-100. The first launch of an uncrewed CST-100 capsule occurred atop a human-rated Atlas V on the morning of December 20, 2019, however an anomaly with the Mission Elapsed Time clock aboard the CST-100 caused the spacecraft to enter a suboptimal orbit. As a result, the CST-100 could not achieve orbital insertion to reach the International Space Station, and instead deorbited after two days.\n\nIn 2015, ULA announced that the Aerojet Rocketdyne-produced AJ-60A solid rocket boosters (SRBs) currently in use on Atlas V will be superseded by new GEM 63 boosters produced by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. The extended GEM-63XL boosters will also be used on the Vulcan rocket that will replace the Atlas V.\n\nEach Atlas V booster configuration has a three-digit designation. The first digit shows the diameter (in meters) of the payload fairing and has a value of \"4\" or \"5\" for fairing launches and \"N\" for crew capsule launches (as no payload fairing is used when a crew capsule is launched). The second digit indicates the number of solid rocket boosters (SRBs) attached to the base of the rocket and can range from \"0\" through \"3\" with the 4-meter fairing, and \"0\" through \"5\" with the 5-meter fairing. As seen in the first image, all SRB layouts are asymmetrical. The third digit represents the number of engines on the Centaur stage, either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nFor example, an Atlas V 551 has a 5-meter fairing, 5 SRBs, and 1 Centaur engine, whereas an Atlas V 431 has a 4-meter fairing, 3 SRBs, and 1 Centaur engine. The Atlas V N22 with no fairing, two SRBs, and 2 Centaur engines was first launched in 2019. The flight carried the Starliner vehicle for its first orbital test flight.\n\n, all versions of the Atlas V, its design and production rights, and intellectual property rights are owned by ULA and Lockheed Martin.\n\nList date: August 8, 2019 Mass to LEO numbers are at an inclination of 28.5°. Acronyms: Single Engine Centaur (SEC), Dual Engine Centaur (DEC).\nBefore 2016, pricing information for Atlas V launches was limited. In 2010, NASA contracted with ULA to launch the MAVEN mission on an Atlas V 401 for approximately $187 million. The 2013 cost of this configuration for the Air Force under their block buy of 36 rockets was $164 million. In 2015, the TDRS-M launch on an Atlas 401 cost NASA $132.4 million.\n\nStarting in 2016, ULA provided pricing for the Atlas V through its RocketBuilder website, advertising a base price for each rocket configuration, which ranges from $109 million for the 401 up to $153 million for the 551. Each additional SRB adds an average of $6.8 million to the cost of the rocket. Customers can also choose to purchase larger payload fairings or additional launch service options. NASA and Air Force launch costs are often higher than equivalent commercial missions due to additional government accounting, analysis, processing, and mission assurance requirements, which can add $30–$80 million to the cost of a launch.\n\nIn 2013, launch costs for commercial satellites to GTO averaged about $100 million, significantly lower than historic Atlas V pricing. However, in recent years the price of an Atlas V has dropped from approximately $180 million to $109 million, in large part due to competitive pressure that emerged in the launch services marketplace during the early 2010s. ULA CEO Tory Bruno has stated that ULA needs at least 2 commercial missions each year in order to stay profitable going forward. ULA is not attempting to win these missions on purely lowest purchase price, stating that it \"would rather be the best \"value\" provider\". ULA suggests that customers will have much lower insurance and delay costs because of the high Atlas V reliability and schedule certainty, making overall customer costs close to that of using competitors like the SpaceX Falcon 9.\n\nIn 2006, ULA offered an Atlas V Heavy option that would use three Common Core Booster (CCB) stages strapped together to lift a 29,400 kg payload to low Earth orbit. ULA stated at the time that 95% of the hardware required for the Atlas V Heavy has already been flown on the Atlas V single-core vehicles. The lifting capability of the proposed rocket was to be roughly equivalent to the Delta IV Heavy, which utilizes RS-68 engines developed and produced domestically by Aerojet Rocketdyne.\n\nA 2006 report, prepared by the RAND Corporation for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, stated that Lockheed Martin had decided not to develop an Atlas V heavy-lift vehicle (HLV). The report recommended for the Air Force and the National Reconnaissance Office to \"determine the necessity of an EELV heavy-lift variant, including development of an Atlas V Heavy\", and to \"resolve the RD-180 issue, including coproduction, stockpile, or U.S. development of an RD-180 replacement\".\n\nIn 2010, ULA stated that the Atlas V Heavy configuration could be available to customers 30 months from the date of order.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, the Atlas V program gained access to the tooling and processes for 5-meter-diameter stages used on Delta IV when Boeing and Lockheed Martin space operations were merged into the United Launch Alliance. This led to a proposal to combine the 5 meter diameter Delta IV tankage production processes with dual RD-180 engines, resulting in the Atlas Phase 2.\n\nAn Atlas V PH2-Heavy consisting of three 5 m stages in parallel with six RD-180s was considered in the Augustine Report as a possible heavy lifter for use in future space missions, as well as the Shuttle-derived Ares V and Ares V Lite. If built, the Atlas PH2-Heavy was projected to be able to launch a payload mass of approximately 70 metric tons into an orbit of 28.5° inclination.\nNeither of the Atlas V Phase 2 proposals progressed to development work.\nThe Atlas V Common Core Booster was to have been used as the first stage of the joint US-Japanese GX rocket, which was scheduled to make its first flight in 2012. GX launches would have been from the Atlas V launch complex at Vandenberg AFB, SLC-3E. However, the Japanese government decided to cancel the GX project in December 2009.\n\nIn 2017, a consortium of companies, including Aerojet and Dynetics, sought to license the production or manufacturing rights to the Atlas V using the AR1 engine in place of the RD-180. The proposal was rejected by ULA.\n\nFor planned launches, see List of Atlas launches (2020–2029).\n\nThe first payload, the Hot Bird 6 communications satellite, was launched to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) on 21 August 2002 by an Atlas V 401.\n\nOn 12 August 2005, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was launched aboard an Atlas V 401 rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Centaur upper stage of the rocket completed its burns over a 56-minute period and placed MRO into an interplanetary transfer orbit towards Mars\n\nOn 19 January 2006, New Horizons was launched by a Lockheed Martin Atlas V 551 rocket. A third stage was added to increase the heliocentric (escape) speed. This was the first launch of the Atlas V 551 configuration with five solid rocket boosters, and the first Atlas V with a third stage.\n\nOn 6 December 2015, Atlas V lifted its heaviest payload to date into orbit – a Cygnus resupply craft.\n\nOn 8 September 2016, the OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission was launched on an Atlas V 411 rocket. It was scheduled to arrive at the asteroid Bennu in 2018 and return with a sample ranging from 60 grams to 2 kilograms in 2023.\n\nThe first four Boeing X-37B spaceplane missions were successfully launched with the Atlas V. The X-37B, also known as the Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), is a reusable robotic spacecraft operated by USAF that can autonomously conduct landings from orbit to a runway. The first four X-37B flights were launched on Atlas V's from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida with subsequent landings taking place on the Space Shuttle runway located at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.\n\nOn 20 December 2019, the first Starliner crew capsule was launched in Boe-OFT uncrewed test flight. The Atlas V carrier rocket performed flawlessly but an anomaly with the spacecraft left it in a wrong orbit. The orbit was too low to reach the flight's destination of ISS, and the mission was subsequently cut short.\n\nIn its 82 launches (as of February 2020), starting with its first launch in August 2002, Atlas V has had an almost perfect mission success rate. This is in contrast to the industry failure rate of 5–10%. However, there have been two anomalous flights that – while still successful in their mission – prompted a grounding of the Atlas fleet while investigations determined the root cause of their problems.\n\nThe first anomalous event in the use of the Atlas V launch system occurred on June 15, 2007, when the engine in the Centaur upper stage of an Atlas V shut down early, leaving its payload – a pair of NRO L-30 ocean surveillance satellites – in a lower than intended orbit. The cause of the anomaly was traced to a leaky valve, which allowed fuel to leak during the coast between the first and second burns. The resulting lack of fuel caused the second burn to terminate 4 seconds early. Replacing the valve led to a delay in the next Atlas V launch. However, the customer (the National Reconnaissance Office) categorized the mission as a success.\n\nA flight on March 23, 2016, suffered an underperformance anomaly on the first-stage burn and shut down 5 seconds early. The Centaur proceeded to boost the Orbital Cygnus payload, the heaviest on an Atlas to date, into the intended orbit by utilizing its fuel reserves to make up for the shortfall from the first stage. This longer burn cut short a later Centaur disposal burn. An investigation of the incident revealed that this anomaly was due to a fault in the main engine mixture-ratio supply valve, which restricted the flow of fuel to the engine. The investigation and subsequent examination of the valves on upcoming missions led to a delay of the next several launches.\n\nIn 2014, geopolitical and US political considerations led to an effort to replace the Russian-supplied RD-180 engine used on the first-stage booster of the Atlas V. Formal study contracts were issued in June 2014 to a number of US rocket-engine suppliers. The results of those studies have led a decision by ULA to develop the new Vulcan launch vehicle to replace the existing Atlas V and Delta IV.\n\nIn September 2014, ULA announced a partnership with Blue Origin to develop the BE-4 LOX/methane engine to replace the RD-180 on a new first-stage booster. As the Atlas V core is designed around RP-1 fuel and cannot be retrofitted to use a methane-fueled engine, a new first stage is being developed. This booster will have the same first-stage tankage diameter as the Delta IV and will be powered by two thrust BE-4 engines. The engine was already in its third year of development by Blue Origin, and ULA expected the new stage and engine to start flying no earlier than 2019.\n\nVulcan will initially use the same Centaur upper stage as on Atlas V, later to be upgraded to ACES. It will also use a variable number of optional solid rocket boosters, called the GEM 63XL, derived from the new solid boosters planned for Atlas V.\n\nAs of 2017, the Aerojet AR1 rocket engine was under development as a backup plan for Vulcan.\n\n, no replacement was expected before mid-2021.\n\nComparable rockets:\n\n"}

He became a child actor at the age of eight and is perhaps best known for his role as Sandy Ricks in the feature films \"Flipper\" and \"Flipper's New Adventure\", as well as for reprising his role for the NBC television series adaptation, also called \"Flipper\".\n\nHalpin was born in Astoria, Queens, New York City, the son of Eugene A. Halpin and the former Helen Joan Szczepanski. His father was of Irish and German descent, and his maternal grandparents were Polish. He grew up with his family in Long Island City. He has an older brother, Eugene, Jr., and an older sister, Joan. He and his siblings were reared as Roman Catholics.\n\nHalpin's career began when a music teacher, impressed by Halpin's \"all-American\" look, encouraged him to try acting. In 1955 he co-starred with Natalie Wood in an episode of \"Studio One\" entitled \"Miracle at Potter's Farm\". Numerous roles followed, and by his mid-teens, Halpin had appeared on many of the major TV series of the day: \"Armstrong Circle Theatre\", \"The United States Steel Hour\", \"Kraft Television Theatre\", \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\", \"The Phil Silvers Show\", \"Harbormaster\", \"The Defenders\", \"Route 66\", \"Naked City\", \"The Everglades\", and had a recurring role for six months on the soap opera \"Young Doctor Malone\".\n\nHalpin's early career also included several stage roles. He made his Broadway debut in \"Take Me Along\" starring Jackie Gleason, and appeared in \"Sunrise at Campobello\", and with Mary Martin in both \"Annie Get Your Gun\" and \"Peter Pan\". Halpin also acted in plays that were televised on \"The Play of the Week\" including starring with Broadway luminaries Burgess Meredith and Zero Mostel in the critically acclaimed avant-garde play \"Waiting for Godot\".\n\nHalpin's most famous role came when at age 15 he was picked to play the 12-year-old Sandy Ricks in producer Ivan Tors' 1963 feature film \"Flipper\" (filmed in the Florida Keys and Miami), starring alongside Chuck Connors, who played Sandy's father and fisherman Porter Ricks. The successful film spawned a sequel, \"Flipper's New Adventure\" (filmed mainly in the Bahamas), released in 1964, and with new co-star Brian Kelly as Porter Ricks, a trainee Park Ranger who, after his training, is assigned to the fictitious Coral Key Park. Kelly played a widowed father to Sandy (although in reality Halpin was only sixteen years younger than Kelly). Kelly and Halpin kept the same roles for the television series that began filming in the summer of 1964, adding younger brother Bud, played by Tommy Norden.\n\nHalpin was chosen by Tors for the role of Sandy Ricks because of his skills in the water as well as his extensive prior acting experience. He also proved able to bond quickly with the dolphins who filled the role of Flipper. This chemistry paved the way for the launching of the TV series after the two feature films. By the time filming of the TV series commenced, Halpin had become an expert skin and scuba diver and exhibited an easy athleticism that enabled him to perform many of his own stunts in and below the water including a number of dangerous scenes involving sharks. His popular TV character became defined by many water-activity related plots with him often wearing nothing more than what came to be his signature cut-off blue jeans shorts.\n\nThe television series ran for eighty-eight episodes from 1964 to 1967 (with Halpin appearing in all but three episodes) and is still in syndication. It was filmed in the park and waters around Key Biscayne, Florida, at the Ivan Tors (now Greenwich) Studios and the Miami Seaquarium, both in Miami. The series performed strongly in the hotly contested Saturday night TV slot, rating in the Top 25 of all TV shows in its debut 1964-65 season. The series made Halpin a teen idol, especially among adolescent viewers. He was often featured in such magazines as \"Bravo\", \"Teen Life\", \"16 Magazine\", and the earliest issues of \"Tiger Beat\". On the basis of his appearances in the original \"Flipper\" feature films, Halpin was a guest 'contestant' on the CBS panel show \"To Tell the Truth\" just prior to the beginning of filming of the \"Flipper (1964 TV series)\", on March 30, 1964. He appeared on the show again just prior to the filming of the second season, on April 15, 1965.\n\nAfter \"Flipper\" ended, Halpin appeared in feature films, including as Stu MacRae (teen son of Richard Greene's starring character) in Ivan Tors' \"Island of the Lost\" (1967), as Bo (student radical who befriends a teenage girl travelling on a European bus tour) in \"If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium\" (1969), as Keith (First Mate on a shabby vessel chartered for a tour that stumbles on 'living dead' Nazis) in iconic niche horror movie \"Shock Waves\" (1977) and as Ken Wilson in \"Flipper\" co-creator Ricou Browning's \"Mr. No Legs\" (1979). Television guest appearances in the years shortly after \"Flipper\" were as Kenny Carter, Jr., in the Carl Betz series \"Judd, for the Defense\" (1968), as a celebrity contestant on \"The Dating Game\" (1968), as Ben Cabot, Jr., in \"Bracken's World\" (1969), as Greg in Ivan Tors' \"Primus\" (1972), and as Eric Bates in \"Caribe\" (1975).\n\nHe appeared in the 1968 episode, \"A Mule … Like the Army's Mule\" of the syndicated anthology series \"Death Valley Days\", in which he was cast as the outlaw Sandy King, the youngest member of the \"Curly Bill\" Brocius gang. In the story line, King is befriended by a United States Army lieutenant, played by Sam Melville. Robert Yuro was cast as \"Curly Bill\".\n\nA notable later appearance was in the 1980 television movie \"The Ordeal of Dr. Mudd\", a dramatization about Samuel Mudd (played by Dennis Weaver), the Maryland physician who was imprisoned as an accomplice to John Wilkes Booth in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, where Halpin played David Herold, the conspirator who brought Booth, suffering from a broken leg incurred in the process of assassinating Lincoln, to Dr. Mudd for treatment.\n\nFollowing an acting career that spanned three decades, Halpin began working as a stuntman, marine coordinator, diver, and speedboat pilot for such feature films as \"Never Say Never Again\", \"Porky's Revenge!\", \"Flight of the Navigator\" and \"\" as well as for the television series \"Miami Vice\". He also continued to make cameo appearances, most notably, on the television series \"Key West\", \"Miami Vice\" and in the 1996 feature film remake, \"Flipper\", starring a 15-year-old Elijah Wood as Sandy Ricks.\n\nHalpin lives on the west coast of Florida with his wife, Deborah. He has three sons, Kyle Austin Halpin (born October 1980), Blair Luke Halpin (born December 1982), and Courtney Luke Halpin (born April 1990). In 2015 it was reported that Halpin was suffering from Stage IV head and neck cancer. A website to assist in his care has been established. In June 2016 a family friend announced the cancer was in remission but that Halpin was at the time in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n"}

{"id": "1824796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1824796", "title": "K. Sri Dhammananda", "text": "K. Sri Dhammananda\n\nK. Sri Dhammananda (born Martin Gamage, 18 March 1919 – 31 August 2006) was a Sri Lankan Buddhist monk and scholar.\n\nBorn in the village of Kirinde in Matara, Sri Lanka, Dhammananda spent most of his life and career in Malaysia. He was ordained as a novice monk (\"samanera\") at the age of 12 and was fully ordained in 1940. After arriving in Malaya, now part of Malaysia, in 1952, Dhammananda established himself as the foremost Theravada Buddhist monk in Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nVenerable Dhammananda enrolled at the Sri Dhammarama Pirivena, Ratmalana in 1935, and then at the Vidyawardhana Buddhist Institute, Colombo, 1937 for a more detailed study of the Buddha's teaching. His mentor was the Venerable Kotawila Deepananda Nayaka Thera. Upon completion of his studies in 1938, he entered Vidyalankara Pirivena, in Peliyagoda, Kelaniya, a prestigious Buddhist college that has since been upgraded into a university.\n\nFor the next seven years, Venerable Dhammananda attended a diploma programme at the Vidyalanka Pirivena where he studied Sanskrit, the Pali Tipitaka and Buddhist philosophy, besides other secular subjects. His principal tutor at the Institute was the Venerable Lunupokune Sri Dhammananda, an eminent scholar monk. At age 26, he successfully graduated with a diploma in Linguistics and Pali Tipitaka.\n\nHis seven years of intensive learning and training in monastic discipline from 1939 to 1945 at the Vidyalanka Pirivena provided him the relevant knowledge and skills in missionary techniques. He was able to use his training to assist the Buddhists in Ceylon, especially those who were English educated and had been prime targets of Christian proselytisation, in understanding the more intellectual aspects of the Buddha's teachings.\nIn 1945 Venerable Dhammananda furthered his tertiary education at the Benares Hindu University in India where he was awarded a scholarship. At the university, he read Sanskrit, Hindi and Indian Philosophy.\n\nHis contemporaries at the University included Venerable P. Panananda Nayaka Thera of Colombo, Venerable Dr. H. Saddhatissa Maha Thera (who later became head of the London Buddhist Vihara), Venerable Dr. U. Dhammaratana and the late Venerable Dr. Amritananda Thera, former head of the Sangha of Nepal. Venerable Dhammananda studied four years at the university graduating with a Master of Arts degree in Indian Philosophy in 1949. Among the many well-known professors who taught him was the late Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, who later became President of the Republic of India.\nHaving completed his studies, Venerable Dhammananda returned to Ceylon. In Kotawilla he established the Sudharma Buddhist Institute and tended to the educational, welfare and religious needs of the villagers. He also published a quarterly Buddhist journal \"Sudharma\" in Sinhalese. He gave regular teachings to the devotees to improve their knowledge and practice of Buddhism.\n\nIn 1952, Venerable K. Sri Pannasara Nayaka Thera, head of the Vidyalanakara Pirivena, received an invitation from the Sasana Abhiwurdhi Wardhana Society of Malaya requesting for a resident monk to administer to the religious needs of the Sinhalese Buddhist community in the country.\nFrom among 400 monks at the Vidyalankara Pirivena, Venerable Dhammananda was selected for the mission to Malaya. He readily accepted the invitation even though he had wanted to serve the Buddhist in his native land. He was fully aware that while Ceylon had many learned and dedicated monks, Malaya did not have enough qualified monks to conduct even a simple religious ceremony.\nMalaya, during the 1950s, had very few Theravada Buddhist temples where devotees could learn the teachings. However, it was not short of temples as there were hundreds of Chinese and Thai Buddhist temples in the country. Devotees visited them mainly to request for blessings or to listen to their chanting. Such was the situation when Venerable Dhammananda set sail from Ceylon on 2 January 1952 for Malaya.\n\nVenerable Dhammananda's journey to Malaya took three days. Upon his arrival in Penang on 5 January 1952, Venerable Dhammananda stayed at the Mahindarama Buddhist Temple. The abbot then was Venerable K. Gunaratana Maha Nayaka Thera (1891–1964), a Sinhalese monk well known for his lucid and simple explanations of the Buddha's teachings. He took the opportunity to discuss with Venerable Gunaratana some of the problems and issues involved in propagation work in Malaya. It was a practical arrangement, with Venerable Gunaratana concentrating his missionary efforts in Penang while Venerable Dhammananda focussed on the Kuala Lumpur area. Venerable Gunaratana had been in Malaya since 1926 and was quite familiar with the situation of Buddhism in the country.\n\nMalaya during the 1950s was in the midst of the Emergency, declared by the British Military Administration, due to the Communist insurgency. As a result, he had to take a flight to Kuala Lumpur as the train services in the country were disrupted by Communist attacks. He arrived at the Brickfields Temple, and was warmly welcomed by Venerable M. Pannasiri Maha Thera, a former colleague from the Vidyalankara Pirivena. Having come to serve the Buddhist community in Malaya, Venerable Dhammananda wasted no time in planning out the religious activities at the Temple.\n\nVenerable Dhammananda arrived in Malaya in 1952, first stopping in Penang before taking up residence at the Brickfields Temple, Kuala Lumpur. He came at the invitation of the Sasana Abhiwurdhi Wardhana Society (SAWS), which then catered mainly for the Sinhala Buddhist community. Working from this base, he energetically set about bringing Buddhism to Malaysians, mainly the English educated Chinese who began to visit the temple to hear him expound the Dharma. With his missionary zeal he realised that his ideals would be better achieved if he could set up a society to harness the energies of these newcomers to Buddhism.\n\nThus, in 1962 he established the Buddhist Missionary Society (BMS) at the Buddhist Temple. It is largely responsible for the propagation of Buddhism through publications and the sponsorship of Buddhist seminars, lectures and talks, as well as regular Dharma discussions, youth leadership training and welfare activities. Its role as a missionary society is clearly stated among its \"aims and objects\" as follows:\n\n\nUsing the Brickfields Temple (now known as the Buddhist Maha Vihara) as its base, working closely with SAWS, the BMS grew by leaps and bounds. It has been very effective in sponsoring the publication of numerous booklets and literature on Buddhism, many of them written by the Venerable himself. Popular titles by other well-known writers were also reprinted. Many of these publications are for free distribution while others are for same at a very nominal price to ensure that more people have the opportunity to read the Dharma. Another successful project is the 12-lesson \"Buddhism for You\" Correspondence Course which was launched in 1979. Within a year more than 500 students had registered for the course.\n\nThe BMS, under the spiritual guidance of Venerable Dhammananda, has targeted the younger generation in its many activities. Thus, a BMS Youth Section was established to organise activities for teenagers and those below 40 years, including the \"Buddhism for Beginners\" course for newcomers to the Dharma at the temple. A BMS Ladies Section has also been established to provide religious and welfare activities. He was instrumental in founding the Society's magazine \"The Voice of Buddhism\" which today is in its 33rd year of publication. It is distributed free to members as well as readers all over the globe, carrying articles relevant to Buddhism as well as reporting the activities of the BMS and SAWS in the Buddhist Maha Vihara.\n\nVen. Dhammananda wrote approximately 60 Buddhist works, ranging from small pamphlets to texts of over 700 pages. He also received a number of honorary doctorates:\n\n\nVen. Dr. Dhammananda died on 31 August 2006. It is claimed that there were auspicious signs including lights and auras around the funeral site.\n\n"}

To begin his artistic education he relocated in 1878 to Munich, where he would settle for life. From 1881 to 1885 Stuck attended the Munich Academy.\n\nHe first became well known by cartoons for \"Fliegende Blätter\", and vignette designs for programmes and book decoration. In 1889 he exhibited his first paintings at the Munich Glass Palace, winning a gold medal for \"The Guardian of Paradise\".\n\nIn 1892 Stuck co-founded the Munich Secession, and also executed his first sculpture, \"Athlete\". The next year he won further acclaim with the critical and public success of what is now his best known work, the painting \"The Sin\". Also during 1893, Stuck was awarded a gold medal for painting at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and was appointed to a royal professorship. In 1895, he began teaching painting at the Munich Academy.\n\nIn 1897 Stuck married an American widow, Mary Lindpainter, and began work designing his own residence and studio, the Villa Stuck. His designs for the villa included everything from layout to interior decorations; for his furniture Stuck received another gold medal at the 1900 Paris World Exposition.\n\nHaving attained a high public profile by this time, Stuck was ennobled on December 9, 1905, and would receive further public honours from around Europe during the remainder of his life. He continued to be well respected among young artists as professor at the Munich Academy, even after his artistic styles became unfashionable. His students over the years included Paul Klee, Hans Purrmann, Wassily Kandinsky, Alf Bayrle and Josef Albers.\n\nHe was a member of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers.\n\nFranz von Stuck died on August 30, 1928, in Munich; his funeral address memorialized him as \"the last prince of art of Munich's great days\". He is buried in the Munich Waldfriedhof next to his wife Mary.\n\nStuck's subject matter was primarily from mythology, inspired by the work of Arnold Böcklin. Large forms dominate most of his paintings and indicate his proclivities for sculpture. His seductive female nudes are a prime example of popular Symbolist content. Stuck paid much attention to the frames for his paintings and generally designed them himself with such careful use of panels, gilt carving and inscriptions that the frames must be considered as an integral part of the overall piece.\n\nRitter von Stuck's \"Kämpfende Amazone\" (fighting Amazon), created in 1897, graced Hermann Göring's \"Carinhall\".\n\nBy the time of his death, Stuck's importance as an artist in his own right had almost been forgotten: his art seemed old-fashioned and irrelevant to a generation that had endured World War I. Stuck's reputation languished until the late 1960s when a renewed interest in Art Nouveau brought him to attention once more. In 1968 the Villa Stuck was opened to the public; it is now a museum.\n\nIn Robert Waite's 1977 book \"The Psychopathic God: Adolph Hitler\" and numerous other sources it is noted that Franz Stuck was Hitler's favorite painter from childhood on.\n\nStuck's paintings were mentioned by Carl Jung, who wrote:\n\n\n"}

He graduated from Yale College in 1841, where he was a member of Skull and Bones and studied law, but he soon took up literature. Throughout his life he showed a particular interest in agriculture and landscape gardening, which he followed at first in pursuit of health. He served as U.S. consul at Venice, Italy, from 1853 to 1854, and in 1855 he settled at his estate, called Edgewood, near New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nHe was best known as the author (under the pseudonym of \"Ik Marvel\") of the sentimental essays contained in the volumes \"Reveries of a Bachelor, or a Book of the Heart\" (first published in book form in 1850) and \"Dream Life, a Fable of the Seasons\" (1851). \"Reveries of a Bachelor\" examines the dream-like lives Americans were living at the time. It was one of the top best sellers of its time but has received little attention from 19th century literary critics. In the text, Ik Marvel theorizes on boyhood, country life style, marriage, travel, and dreaming.\n\n\"Dream Life, a Fable of the Seasons\", was dedicated to Washington Irving, to whom Mitchell was introduced by Lewis Gaylord Clark. Irving said of the dedication: \"Though I have a great disinclination in general to be the object of literary oblations and compliments... I have enjoyed your writings with such peculiar relish and have been so drawn toward the author by the qualities of head and heart evinced in them, that I confess I feel gratified by the dedication\". Mitchell produced books of travel and volumes of essays on rural themes including Reveries of a Bachelor (1850), \"My Farm of Edgewood: A Country Book\" (1863), sketchy studies of English monarchs and of English and American literature, and a character novel entitled \"Doctor Johns\" (1866). His other works include \"About Old Story-tellers\" (1878) and \"American Lands and Letters\" (1897–99).\n\n\"Reveries of a Bachelor\" was one of poet Emily Dickinson's favorite books.\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., called him \"one of the pleasantest of our American writers.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It is derived from Einstein's mass-energy equivalency and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and is \"c\"/\"h\" ≈ 1.36 × 10 bits per second per kilogram. This value is important when designing cryptographic algorithms, as it can be used to determine the minimum size of encryption keys or hash values required to create an algorithm that could never be cracked by a brute-force search.\n\nFor example, a computer with the mass of the entire Earth operating at the Bremermann's limit could perform approximately 10 mathematical computations per second. If one assumes that a cryptographic key can be tested with only one operation, then a typical 128-bit key could be cracked in under 10 seconds. However, a 256-bit key (which is already in use in some systems) would take about two minutes to crack. Using a 512-bit key would increase the cracking time to approaching 10 years, without increasing the time for encryption by more than a constant factor (depending on the encryption algorithms used).\n\nThe limit has been further analysed in later literature as the maximum rate at which a system with energy spread formula_1 can evolve into an orthogonal and hence distinguishable state to another, formula_2 In particular, Margolus and Levitin have shown that a quantum system with average energy E takes at least time formula_3 to evolve into an orthogonal state.\nHowever, it has been shown that access to quantum memory in principle allows computational algorithms that require arbitrarily small amount of energy/time per one elementary computation step.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1824845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1824845", "title": "Cartesian tensor", "text": "Cartesian tensor\n\nIn geometry and linear algebra, a Cartesian tensor uses an orthonormal basis to represent a tensor in a Euclidean space in the form of components. Converting a tensor's components from one such basis to another is through an orthogonal transformation.\n\nThe most familiar coordinate systems are the two-dimensional and three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate systems. Cartesian tensors may be used with any Euclidean space, or more technically, any finite-dimensional vector space over the field of real numbers that has an inner product.\n\nUse of Cartesian tensors occurs in physics and engineering, such as with the Cauchy stress tensor and the moment of inertia tensor in rigid body dynamics. Sometimes general curvilinear coordinates are convenient, as in high-deformation continuum mechanics, or even necessary, as in general relativity. While orthonormal bases may be found for some such coordinate systems (e.g. tangent to spherical coordinates), Cartesian tensors may provide considerable simplification for applications in which rotations of rectilinear coordinate axes suffice. The transformation is a passive transformation, since the coordinates are changed and not the physical system.\n\nIn 3d Euclidean space, ℝ, the standard basis is e, e, e. Each basis vector points along the x-, y-, and z-axes, and the vectors are all unit vectors (or normalized), so the basis is orthonormal.\n\nThroughout, when referring to Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions, a right-handed system is assumed and this is much more common than a left-handed system in practice, see orientation (vector space) for details.\n\nFor Cartesian tensors of order 1, a Cartesian vector a can be written algebraically as a linear combination of the basis vectors e, e, e:\n\nwhere the coordinates of the vector with respect to the Cartesian basis are denoted \"a\", \"a\", \"a\". It is common and helpful to display the basis vectors as column vectors\n\nwhen we have a coordinate vector in a column vector representation:\n\nA row vector representation is also legitimate, although in the context of general curvilinear coordinate systems the row and column vector representations are used separately for specific reasons – see Einstein notation and covariance and contravariance of vectors for why.\n\nThe term \"component\" of a vector is ambiguous: it could refer to:\n\n\nA more general notation is tensor index notation, which has the flexibility of numerical values rather than fixed coordinate labels. The Cartesian labels are replaced by tensor indices in the basis vectors e ↦ e, e ↦ e, e ↦ e and coordinates \"a\" ↦ \"a\", \"a\" ↦ \"a\", \"a\" ↦ \"a\". In general, the notation e, e, e refers to \"any\" basis, and \"a\", \"a\", \"a\" refers to the corresponding coordinate system; although here they are restricted to the Cartesian system. Then:\n\nIt is standard to use the Einstein notation—the summation sign for summation over an index that is present exactly twice within a term may be suppressed for notational conciseness:\n\nAn advantage of the index notation over coordinate-specific notations is the independence of the dimension of the underlying vector space, i.e. the same expression on the right hand side takes the same form in higher dimensions (see below). Previously, the Cartesian labels x, y, z were just labels and \"not\" indices. (It is informal to say \"\"i\" = x, y, z\").\n\nA dyadic tensor T is an order 2 tensor formed by the tensor product ⊗ of two Cartesian vectors a and b, written T = a ⊗ b. Analogous to vectors, it can be written as a linear combination of the tensor basis , , ..., (the right hand side of each identity is only an abbreviation, nothing more):\n\nRepresenting each basis tensor as a matrix:\n\nthen T can be represented more systematically as a matrix:\n\nSee matrix multiplication for the notational correspondence between matrices and the dot and tensor products.\n\nMore generally, whether or not T is a tensor product of two vectors, it is always a linear combination of the basis tensors with coordinates \"T\", \"T\", ... \"T\":\n\nwhile in terms of tensor indices:\n\nand in matrix form:\n\nSecond order tensors occur naturally in physics and engineering when physical quantities have directional dependence in the system, often in a \"stimulus-response\" way. This can be mathematically seen through one aspect of tensors - they are multilinear functions. A second order tensor T which takes in a vector u of some magnitude and direction will return a vector v; of a different magnitude and in a different direction to u, in general. The notation used for functions in mathematical analysis leads us to write , while the same idea can be expressed in matrix and index notations (including the summation convention), respectively:\n\nBy \"linear\", if for two scalars \"ρ\" and \"σ\" and vectors r and s, then in function and index notations:\n\nand similarly for the matrix notation. The function, matrix, and index notations all mean the same thing. The matrix forms provide a clear display of the components, while the index form allows easier tensor-algebraic manipulation of the formulae in a compact manner. Both provide the physical interpretation of \"directions\"; vectors have one direction, while second order tensors connect two directions together. One can associate a tensor index or coordinate label with a basis vector direction.\n\nThe use of second order tensors are the minimum to describe changes in magnitudes and directions of vectors, as the dot product of two vectors is always a scalar, while the cross product of two vectors is always a pseudovector perpendicular to the plane defined by the vectors, so these products of vectors alone cannot obtain a new vector of any magnitude in any direction. (See also below for more on the dot and cross products). The tensor product of two vectors is a second order tensor, although this has no obvious directional interpretation by itself.\n\nThe previous idea can be continued: if T takes in two vectors p and q, it will return a scalar \"r\". In function notation we write \"r\" = T(p, q), while in matrix and index notations (including the summation convention) respectively:\n\nThe tensor T is linear in both input vectors. When vectors and tensors are written without reference to components, and indices are not used, sometimes a dot · is placed where summations over indices (known as tensor contractions) are taken. For the above cases:\n\nmotivated by the dot product notation:\n\nMore generally, a tensor of order \"m\" which takes in \"n\" vectors (where \"n\" is between 0 and \"m\" inclusive) will return a tensor of order , see Tensor: As multilinear maps for further generalizations and details. The concepts above also apply to pseudovectors in the same way as for vectors. The vectors and tensors themselves can vary within throughout space, in which case we have vector fields and tensor fields, and can also depend on time.\n\nFollowing are some examples:\n\nFor the electrical conduction example, the index and matrix notations would be:\n\nwhile for the rotational kinetic energy \"T\":\n\nSee also constitutive equation for more specialized examples.\n\nIn \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space over the real numbers, ℝ, the standard basis is denoted e, e, e, ... e. Each basis vector e points along the positive \"x\" axis, with the basis being orthonormal. Component \"j\" of e is given by the Kronecker delta:\n\nA vector in ℝ takes the form:\n\nSimilarly for the order 2 tensor above, for each vector a and b in ℝ:\n\nor more generally:\n\nThe position vector x in ℝ is a simple and common example of a vector, and can be represented in \"any\" coordinate system. Consider the case of rectangular coordinate systems with orthonormal bases only. It is possible to have a coordinate system with rectangular geometry if the basis vectors are all mutually perpendicular and not normalized, in which case the basis is ortho\"gonal\" but not ortho\"normal\". However, orthonormal bases are easier to manipulate and are often used in practice. The following results are true for orthonormal bases, not orthogonal ones.\n\nIn one rectangular coordinate system, x as a contravector has coordinates \"x\" and basis vectors e, while as a covector it has coordinates \"x\" and basis covectors e, and we have:\n\nIn another rectangular coordinate system, x as a contravector has coordinates \"\" and bases , while as a covector it has coordinates \"\" and bases , and we have:\n\nEach new coordinate is a function of all the old ones, and vice versa for the inverse function:\n\nand similarly each new basis vector is a function of all the old ones, and vice versa for the inverse function:\n\nfor all \"i\", \"j\".\n\nA vector is invariant under any change of basis, so if coordinates transform according to a transformation matrix L, the bases transform according to the matrix inverse L, and conversely if the coordinates transform according to inverse L, the bases transform according to the matrix L. The difference between each of these transformations is shown conventionally through the indices as superscripts for contravariance and subscripts for covariance, and the coordinates and bases are linearly transformed according to the following rules:\n\nwhere L represents the entries of the transformation matrix (row number is \"i\" and column number is \"j\") and (L) denotes the entries of the inverse matrix of the matrix L.\n\nIf L is an orthogonal transformation (orthogonal matrix), the objects transforming by it are defined as Cartesian tensors. This geometrically has the interpretation that a rectangular coordinate system is mapped to another rectangular coordinate system, in which the norm of the vector x is preserved (and distances are preserved).\n\nThe determinant of L is det(L) = ±1, which corresponds to two types of orthogonal transformation: (+1) for rotations and (−1) for improper rotations (including reflections).\n\nThere are considerable algebraic simplifications, the matrix transpose is the inverse from the definition of an orthogonal transformation:\n\nFrom the previous table, orthogonal transformations of covectors and contravectors are identical. There is no need to differ between raising and lowering indices, and in this context and applications to physics and engineering the indices are usually all subscripted to remove confusion for exponents. All indices will be lowered in the remainder of this article. One can determine the actual raised and lowered indices by considering which quantities are covectors or contravectors, and the relevant transformation rules.\n\nExactly the same transformation rules apply to any vector a, not only the position vector. If its components \"a\" do not transform according to the rules, a is not a vector.\n\nDespite the similarity between the expressions above, for the change of coordinates such as , and the action of a tensor on a vector like , L is not a tensor, but T is. In the change of coordinates, L is a \"matrix\", used to relate two rectangular coordinate systems with orthonormal bases together. For the tensor relating a vector to a vector, the vectors and tensors throughout the equation all belong to the same coordinate system and basis.\n\nThe entries of L are partial derivatives of the new or old coordinates with respect to the old or new coordinates, respectively.\n\nDifferentiating \"\" with respect to \"x\":\n\nso\n\nis an element of the Jacobian matrix. There is a (partially mnemonical) correspondence between index positions attached to L and in the partial derivative: \"i\" at the top and \"j\" at the bottom, in each case, although for Cartesian tensors the indices can be lowered.\n\nConversely, differentiating \"x\" with respect to \"\":\n\nso\n\nis an element of the inverse Jacobian matrix, with a similar index correspondence.\nMany sources state transformations in terms of the partial derivatives:\n\nand the explicit matrix equations in 3d are:\n\nsimilarly for\n\nAs with all linear transformations, L depends on the basis chosen. For two orthonormal bases\n\n\nHence the components reduce to direction cosines between the \"\" and \"x\" axes:\n\nwhere \"θ\" and \"θ\" are the angles between the \"\" and \"x\" axes. In general, \"θ\" is not equal to \"θ\", because for example \"θ\" and \"θ\" are two different angles.\n\nThe transformation of coordinates can be written:\n\n_i\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_j \\right) = x_i\\cos\\theta_{ij}\\\\\n\\upharpoonleft\\downharpoonright\\\\\n</math>\n\nand the explicit matrix equations in 3d are:\n\nsimilarly for\n\nThe geometric interpretation is the \"\" components equal to the sum of projecting the \"x\" components onto the \"\" axes.\n\nThe numbers e⋅e arranged into a matrix would form a symmetric matrix (a matrix equal to its own transpose) due to the symmetry in the dot products, in fact it is the metric tensor g. By contrast e⋅ or ⋅e do \"not\" form symmetric matrices in general, as displayed above. Therefore, while the L matrices are still orthogonal, they are not symmetric.\n\nApart from a rotation about any one axis, in which the \"x\" and \"\" for some \"i\" coincide, the angles are not the same as Euler angles, and so the L matrices are not the same as the rotation matrices.\n\nThe dot product and cross product occur very frequently, in applications of vector analysis to physics and engineering, examples include:\n\n\nHow these products transform under orthogonal transformations is illustrated below.\n\nThe dot product ⋅ of each possible pairing of the basis vectors follows from the basis being orthonormal. For perpendicular pairs we have\n\nwhile for parallel pairs we have\n\nReplacing Cartesian labels by index notation as shown above, these results can be summarized by\n\nwhere \"δ\" are the components of the Kronecker delta. The Cartesian basis can be used to represent \"δ\" in this way.\n\nIn addition, each metric tensor component \"g\" with respect to any basis is the dot product of a pairing of basis vectors:\n\nFor the Cartesian basis the components arranged into a matrix are:\n\nso are the simplest possible for the metric tensor, namely the \"δ\":\n\nThis is \"not\" true for general bases: orthogonal coordinates have diagonal metrics containing various scale factors (i.e. not necessarily 1), while general curvilinear coordinates could also have nonzero entries for off-diagonal components.\n\nThe dot product of two vectors a and b transforms according to\n\nwhich is intuitive, since the dot product of two vectors is a single scalar independent of any coordinates. This also applies more generally to any coordinate systems, not just rectangular ones; the dot product in one coordinate system is the same in any other.\n\nFor the cross product × of two vectors, the results are (almost) the other way round. Again, assuming a right-handed 3d Cartesian coordinate system, cyclic permutations in perpendicular directions yield the next vector in the cyclic collection of vectors:\n\nwhile parallel vectors clearly vanish:\n\nand replacing Cartesian labels by index notation as above, these can be summarized by:\n\nwhere \"i\", \"j\", \"k\" are indices which take values 1, 2, 3. It follows that:\n\nThese permutation relations and their corresponding values are important, and there is an object coinciding with this property: the Levi-Civita symbol, denoted by \"ε\". The Levi-Civita symbol entries can be represented by the Cartesian basis:\n\nwhich geometrically corresponds to the volume of a cube spanned by the orthonormal basis vectors, with sign indicating orientation (and \"not\" a \"positive or negative volume\"). Here, the orientation is fixed by \"ε\" = +1, for a right-handed system. A left-handed system would fix \"ε\" = −1 or equivalently \"ε\" = +1.\n\nThe scalar triple product can now be written:\n\nwith the geometric interpretation of volume (of the parallelepiped spanned by a, b, c) and algebraically is a determinant:\n\nThis in turn can be used to rewrite the cross product of two vectors as follows:\n\nContrary to its appearance, the Levi-Civita symbol is \"not a tensor\", but a pseudotensor, the components transform according to:\n\nTherefore, the transformation of the cross product of a and b is:\n\nand so a × b transforms as a pseudovector, because of the determinant factor.\n\nThe tensor index notation applies to any object which has entities that form multidimensional arrays – not everything with indices is a tensor by default. Instead, tensors are defined by how their coordinates and basis elements change under a transformation from one coordinate system to another.\n\nNote the cross product of two vectors is a pseudovector, while the cross product of a pseudovector with a vector is another vector.\n\nOther identities can be formed from the \"δ\" tensor and \"ε\" pseudotensor, a notable and very useful identity is one that converts two Levi-Civita symbols adjacently contracted over two indices into an antisymmetrized combination of Kronecker deltas:\n\nThe index forms of the dot and cross products, together with this identity, greatly facilitate the manipulation and derivation of other identities in vector calculus and algebra, which in turn are used extensively in physics and engineering. For instance, it is clear the dot and cross products are distributive over vector addition:\n\nwithout resort to any geometric constructions - the derivation in each case is a quick line of algebra. Although the procedure is less obvious, the vector triple product can also be derived. Rewriting in index notation:\n\nand because cyclic permutations of indices in the \"ε\" symbol does not change its value, cyclically permuting indices in \"ε\" to obtain \"ε\" allows us to use the above \"δ\"-\"ε\" identity to convert the \"ε\" symbols into \"δ\" tensors:\n\nthusly:\n\nNote this is antisymmetric in b and c, as expected from the left hand side. Similarly, via index notation or even just cyclically relabelling a, b, and c in the previous result and taking the negative:\n\nand the difference in results show that the cross product is not associative. More complex identities, like quadruple products;\n\nand so on, can be derived in a similar manner.\n\nTensors are defined as quantities which transform in a certain way under linear transformations of coordinates.\n\nLet a = \"ae and b = \"be be two vectors, so that they transform according to \"\" = \"aL\", \"\" = \"bL\".\n\nTaking the tensor product gives:\n\nthen applying the transformation to the components\n\nand to the bases\n\ngives the transformation law of an order-2 tensor. The tensor a⊗b is invariant under this transformation:\n\nMore generally, for any order-2 tensor\n\nthe components transform according to;\n\nand the basis transforms by:\n\nIf R does not transform according to this rule - whatever quantity R may be - it is not an order 2 tensor.\n\nMore generally, for any order \"p\" tensor\n\nthe components transform according to;\n\nand the basis transforms by:\n\nFor a pseudotensor S of order \"p\", the components transform according to;\n\nThe antisymmetric nature of the cross product can be recast into a tensorial form as follows. Let c be a vector, a be a pseudovector, b be another vector, and T be a second order tensor such that:\n\nAs the cross product is linear in a and b, the components of T can be found by inspection, and they are:\n\nso the pseudovector a can be written as an antisymmetric tensor. This transforms as a tensor, not a pseudotensor. For the mechanical example above for the tangential velocity of a rigid body, given by , this can be rewritten as where Ω is the tensor corresponding to the pseudovector ω:\n\nFor an example in electromagnetism, while the electric field E is a vector field, the magnetic field B is a pseudovector field. These fields are defined from the Lorentz force for a particle of electric charge \"q\" traveling at velocity v:\n\nand considering the second term containing the cross product of a pseudovector B and velocity vector v, it can be written in matrix form, with F, E, and v as column vectors and B as an antisymmetric matrix:\n\nIf a pseudovector is explicitly given by a cross product of two vectors (as opposed to entering the cross product with another vector), then such pseudovectors can also be written as antisymmetric tensors of second order, with each entry a component of the cross product. The angular momentum of a classical pointlike particle orbiting about an axis, defined by , is another example of a pseudovector, with corresponding antisymmetric tensor:\n\nAlthough Cartesian tensors do not occur in the theory of relativity; the tensor form of orbital angular momentum J enters the spacelike part of the relativistic angular momentum tensor, and the above tensor form of the magnetic field B enters the spacelike part of the electromagnetic tensor.\n\nThe following formulae are only so simple in Cartesian coordinates - in general curvilinear coordinates there are factors of the metric and its determinant - see tensors in curvilinear coordinates for more general analysis.\n\nFollowing are the differential operators of vector calculus. Throughout, left Φ(r, \"t\") be a scalar field, and\n\nbe vector fields, in which all scalar and vector fields are functions of the position vector r and time \"t\".\n\nThe gradient operator in Cartesian coordinates is given by:\n\nand in index notation, this is usually abbreviated in various ways:\n\nThis operator acts on a scalar field Φ to obtain the vector field directed in the maximum rate of increase of Φ:\n\nThe index notation for the dot and cross products carries over to the differential operators of vector calculus.\n\nThe directional derivative of a scalar field Φ is the rate of change of Φ along some direction vector a (not necessarily a unit vector), formed out of the components of a and the gradient:\n\nThe divergence of a vector field A is:\n\nNote the interchange of the components of the gradient and vector field yields a different differential operator\n\nwhich could act on scalar or vector fields. In fact, if A is replaced by the velocity field u(r, \"t\") of a fluid, this is a term in the material derivative (with many other names) of continuum mechanics, with another term being the partial time derivative:\n\nwhich usually acts on the velocity field leading to the non-linearity in the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\nAs for the curl of a vector field A, this can be defined as a pseudovector field by means of the \"ε\" symbol:\n\nwhich is only valid in three dimensions, or an antisymmetric tensor field of second order via antisymmetrization of indices, indicated by delimiting the antisymmetrized indices by square brackets (see Ricci calculus):\n\nwhich is valid in any number of dimensions. In each case, the order of the gradient and vector field components should not be interchanged as this would result in a different differential operator:\n\nwhich could act on scalar or vector fields.\n\nFinally, the Laplacian operator is defined in two ways, the divergence of the gradient of a scalar field Φ:\n\nor the square of the gradient operator, which acts on a scalar field Φ or a vector field A:\n\nIn physics and engineering, the gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian operator arise inevitably in fluid mechanics, Newtonian gravitation, electromagnetism, heat conduction, and even quantum mechanics.\n\nVector calculus identities can be derived in a similar way to those of vector dot and cross products and combinations. For example, in three dimensions, the curl of a cross product of two vector fields A and B:\n\nwhere the product rule was used, and throughout the differential operator was not interchanged with A or B. Thus:\n\nOne can continue the operations on tensors of higher order. Let T = T(r, \"t\") denote a second order tensor field, again dependent on the position vector r and time \"t\".\n\nFor instance, the gradient of a vector field in two equivalent notations (\"dyadic\" and \"tensor\", respectively) is:\n\nwhich is a tensor field of second order.\n\nThe divergence of a tensor is:\n\nwhich is a vector field. This arises in continuum mechanics in Cauchy's laws of motion - the divergence of the Cauchy stress tensor σ is a vector field, related to body forces acting on the fluid.\n\nCartesian tensors are as in tensor algebra, but Euclidean structure of and restriction of the basis brings some simplifications compared to the general theory.\n\nThe general tensor algebra consists of general mixed tensors of type (\"p\", \"q\"):\n\nwith basis elements:\n\nthe components transform according to:\n\nas for the bases:\n\nFor Cartesian tensors, only the order of the tensor matters in a Euclidean space with an orthonormal basis, and all indices can be lowered. A Cartesian basis does not exist unless the vector space has a positive-definite metric, and thus cannot be used in relativistic contexts.\n\nDyadic tensors were historically the first approach to formulating second-order tensors, similarly triadic tensors for third-order tensors, and so on. Cartesian tensors use tensor index notation, in which the variance may be glossed over and is often ignored, since the components remain unchanged by raising and lowering indices.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was their first on WTG Records (a subsidiary of Epic Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music International). The single \"The One to Sing the Blues\" peaked at #45.\n\nIn 1990, Motörhead vocalist and bassist Lemmy Kilmister moved from England to the U.S., settling in West Hollywood within walking distance of the Rainbow Bar and Grill. With Phil Carson managing the band, the sessions for what would become the album \"1916\" began with Ed Stasium, best known for producing Living Colour. The band recorded four songs with the producer before deciding he had to go. When Lemmy listened to a mix of \"Going to Brazil\", he asked him to turn up four tracks, and on doing so heard claves and tambourines Stasium had added without the band's knowledge. Stasium was fired and Pete Solley hired as producer. According to Stasium, Lemmy's drug and alcohol intake exceeded the limits of the producer's patience, so he quit.\n\n\"1916\" was Motörhead's first studio album in nearly four years, and their first release on WTG after a legal battle with GWR Records was resolved. Some of its songs – including \"The One to Sing the Blues,\" \"I'm So Bad (Baby I Don't Care),\" \"No Voices in the Sky,\" \"Going to Brazil\" and \"Shut You Down\" – were originally performed on Motörhead's 1989 and 1990 tours. The title track – an uncharacteristically slow ballad in which Lemmy's singing is only lightly accompanied – is a tribute to, and reflection on, young soldiers who fell in battle during World War I. In his 2002 memoir, Lemmy reveals that the song was inspired by the Battle of the Somme:\nAlthough songs like the ballad \"Love Me Forever\" and \"Angel City\" (which includes a saxophone) were stylistic departures for the band, the album still contained Motörhead's ear-splitting brand of rock 'n' roll, including \"I'm So Bad (Baby I Don't Care)\" and \"R.A.M.O.N.E.S,\" a tribute to punk band the Ramones, by whom it was covered. Both bands have been cited as iconoclasts who ignored musical trends, remaining loyal to their fan base by touring relentlessly. In the 2002 book \"Hey Ho Let's Go: The Story of the Ramones\", Everett True quotes singer Joey Ramone as saying: \"It was the ultimate honour – like John Lennon wrote a song for you.\"\n\nIn the album's liner notes, the band says:\n\nDue to an unintentional oversight, the French, Bulgarian, Russian, Serbian and Portuguese flags were not featured on the album artwork. \"Love Me Forever\" was later covered by Doro Pesch, and Beyond the Black.\n\nThe Yugoslavian release of the album on ZKP-RTVL was the final record to be released in Slovenia prior to its independence and the renaming of the label to ZKP-RTVS.\n\n\"1916\" was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1992 Grammys, but lost to Metallica's \"Metallica\", released approximately six months later.\n\nThe LP received mostly positive reviews. Robert Christgau rated it an A-, calling it \"sonically retrograde and philosophically advanced.\"\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" awarded the album an A+.\n\"Select\" gave it four out of five, hailing it as \"..the most cohesive and downright ferocious record to appear under the Motorhead banner since the timeless blast of 'Ace Of Spades' in 1980... Motorhead badly needed an album like this, but no one could have guessed they'd do it so convincingly.\"\n\nIn a retrospective review, Allmusic's Alex Henderson gave it three stars out of five: \"The band's sound hadn't changed much, and time hadn't made its sledgehammer approach any less appealing... whether the subject matter is humorously fun or more serious, Motörhead is as inspired as ever on \"1916\".\" Reviewing a reissue on the Hear No Evil label, Kris Needs wrote in \"Classic Rock\": \"One of their most well-rounded sets, this memorabilia-stacked reissue comes with two non-album belters, 'Eagle Rock' and runaway hell train 'Dead Man's Hand'.\"\n\nIn the Motörhead documentary \"The Guts and the Glory\", Lemmy states: \n\nPer the \"1916\" liner notes.\n\n\n"}

The town is part of Upper Macungie Township, approximately southwest of downtown Allentown and east of Kutztown, Pennsylvania.\n\nBreinigsville was named for George Ludwig Breinig (January 31, 1733 – May 12, 1812), a German immigrant who came to America on board the ship \"Lydia\", arriving in Philadelphia on October 13, 1749. He originally settled in Weisenberg Township (tax records show he was assessed 9 pounds in 1762). On May 10, 1771, Breinig purchased around of land and a stone dwelling for 700 pounds from Peter and Catherine Trexler (of \"Trexlertown\") along \"the great road leading to Philadelphia\".\n\nHe resided on that land until his death. Breinig was one of the judges of the election at Allentown, on July 8, 1776, when delegates to the first constitutional convention of the state were elected. During the Revolutionary War, Breinig became the colonel of the Second Battalion of Northampton county militia. In 1786, he was commissioned a justice of the district of Macungie and Weisenberg townships. Breinig is buried at Zion Lehigh Lutheran Church, Alburtis.\n\nAmong his seven children was Peter Breinig, the youngest son, and the founder of Breinigsville, who owned a farm. He built a tavern in the village and operated it for some years. As in most early towns, the tavern served as the center of the community. Today, the tavern is in the location of the Breinigsville Hotel.\n\nIn the early 1800s, the village was a center for the mining of iron ore, furnishing employment to many men. Around 1855, the Allentown Railroad was graded through Breinigsville, but the tracks were never laid. In the 1860s, the Catasauqua and Fogelsville Railroad used the grade to build from Trexlertown, on its main line, into Breinigsville, as part of a branch to serve local limonite (iron ore) mines. The largest deposit of pyrite ore in the region was located 2 miles northwest of Breinigsville. Later, the village was served by the Allentown-Reading Traction Company. These mines had shut down by the end of World War I, and the rails through Breinigsville were consequently abandoned. They were finally removed in the 1940s.\n\nOn the western edge of Breinigsville, a United Brethren Church was built in 1880 whose membership at one time peaked at around 40. Regular services discontinued in 1912.\n\nAt one time, the village had a lumber, grain, and coal depot, a carriage works, and a general store, which are no longer in existence. In the mid-1800s, a two-room school house was built in the town, with the upper grades taught by Miss Edith Walbert and the lower grades taught by Mr. John Shoemaker. While the school has long ceased operations, the building still stands. Around 1860, an independent school district was formed in the township by an act of the legislature. The single school replaced the dozens of smaller schools, including the one in Breinigsville. The school district served until the early 1900s, when the Parkland School District was formed.\n\nIn 1987, AT&T acquired around 137 acres in Breinigsville which became to be known as TEK Park Campus. The facility became Bell Labs' world headquarters for optoelectronics research. In the late '90s, the center was spun off as Lucent Technologies. In 2002, it was spun off again as Agere Systems. In 2003, the park was sold to TriQuint Semiconductor. In 2012, TEK Park was sold to MRA Group for $50 million.\n\nAs of the 2010 census, Breinigsville consists of 51.11% females and 48.89% male. The population is made of 79.92% White Non-Hispanic, 5.24% Black or African American, 0.48% Native American or Alaskan Native, 11.07% Asian, 0.0% Native Hawaiian, 1.55% were two or more races, and 1.74% were some other race. Of the population 7.08% were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry.\n\nThe town has a population of 4,138 with a median age of 34.6. The largest age groups are 19.21% (5–17), 17.97% (25–34), 16.24% (35–44), and 12.87% (45–54). Breinigsville has 1,550 households made of 1,112 families and 438 non-family households. The average is 2.67 individuals per household and 3.16 individuals per family. Additionally, with 1,677 total housing units, 1,550 are occupied and 127 are vacant. 91.2% of households are owner-occupied and 2.34% rent.\n\nBreinigsville is located at 40°32'12\" North, 75°37'53\" West (40.5367627, -75.6312997). Elevation is . Schaefer Run flows east through the village into the Little Lehigh Creek.\n\nBreinigsville is located along U.S. Route 222, between its intersection with the southern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 863 and Route 222's Trexlertown Bypass (Fred Jaindl Memorial Highway). Breinigsville is located between Trexlertown and Maxatawny.\n\nBreinigsville lies within the hot-summer humid continental climate zone (Köppen: \"Dfa\"), and experiences four distinct seasons. Summers are hot and humid, with a July daily average of . In a normal summer, temperatures exceed on 15 days. Winters are cold and snowy with few sunny days, and with a January daytime average high of . Spring and autumn are mild seasons with low humidity. The hardiness zone is 6b.\n\nBreinigsville is served educationally by Parkland School District. The district has one high school, Parkland High School (for grades nine through 12), two middle schools Springhouse Middle School and Orefield Middle School (for grades six through eight), and eight elementary schools (for kindergarten through fifth grade), Cetronia Elementary School, Fogelsville Elementary School, Ironton Elementary School, Fred J. Jaindl Elementary School, Kernsville Elementary School, Kratzer Elementary School, Parkway Manor Elementary School, and Schnecksville Elementary School. Elementary students from the Breinigsville area attend Fogelsville or Jaindl while its middle-school students attend Springhouse.\n\nThe Fred J. Jaindl Elementary School, which opened fall of 2010, is located in Breinigsville.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the economy of Breinigsville was primarily agriculture and mining. A number of large mines existed; the mines and later the train tracks were abandoned. In the early 1900s the town was transformed into a mainly agriculture-based economy. Toward the late 1970s and 80s due to relatively cheaper land prices and close proximity to New York, a number of major distributors and warehouses have relocated to the area. Large facilities and distribution centers in Breinigsville include ShopRite, Olympus, Home Depot, Uline, Niagara Bottling and Nestle/Deer Park Water Bottling Plant. In 2009, Nestlé Waters renovated their facility to become LEED Gold certified. Some warehouses, particularly Amazon's, have been criticized in the local press for dangerous working conditions. In March 2014, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case that involves Amazon's warehouse in Breinigsville.\n\nA number of large book publishing companies also operate from Breinigsville. Amazon's distribution warehouse is situated in Breinigsville. RR Donnelley is also located in the town.

Grim's Greenhouse is located in Breinigsville. The town has a number of large vineyards. Clover Hill Vineyards & Winery as well as Vynecrest Vineyard & Winery are located in Breinigsville; the town is also the home to a major Samuel Adams brewery.\n\nBefore 2013 Breinigsville was served by the Berks-Lehigh Regional Police, which was a multi-jurisdictional police department. The department is now defunct.\n\nEffective December 31, 2012, Upper Macungie Township Police Department serves the town.

As of January 2010, the waterpark was shut down and available for purchase, while the adjacent trailer park remained in operation. In the fall of 2017, Terry Hill Waterpark was purchased by the owners of Clover Hill Vineyards.\n\nBreinigsville has a number of neighborhood parks and playgrounds. Breinigsville Park is located in the center of Breinigsville. That park, , has mile of paved walking/cycling paths. Additionally, it offers a Baseball and Softball fields, Basketball and a Sand volleyball court. The park hosts a large fireworks show every year on Independence Day.\n\nThough it is widely thought to be in Trexlertown, as evidenced by its nickname \"T-Town\", the Valley Preferred Cycling Center is actually located in the Breinigsville section of the township. It is one of the most well known cycling stadiums in the country and attracts cyclists from all over the world.\n\nIn 2004, then-president George W. Bush made an unannounced stop at the Home Town Diner in Breinigsville, PA.\n\nIn 2012, an entire episode of \"30 Minute Meals\" featuring Rachael Ray and Regis Philbin was filmed from the home of a couple from Breinigsville.\n\n"}

It saw the first electoral victory for militant Irish republicanism, which the following year entered electoral politics in full force as Sinn Féin. The successful candidate was the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands, who died twenty-six days later.\n\nThe by-election was caused by the death of the sitting MP, Frank Maguire.\n\nThe constituency, based on the districts of Fermanagh and Dungannon, was created in 1950 and had seen a series of closely fought elections between unionist and Irish nationalist candidates, with several elections being won due to the absence of competing candidates on one side or the other. Nationalists of various hues had won the constituency in the 1950, 1951 and 1955 general elections, while the Ulster Unionist Party had won in 1959, 1964 and 1966. As the Troubles gathered pace, nationalists agreed the Unity pact to run agreed candidates in border seats, with Frank McManus capturing Fermanagh and South Tyrone in the 1970 general election.\n\nThe February 1974 general election was the first to take place after several major political realignments in Northern Ireland. Opposition to the Sunningdale Agreement led to an alliance of unionist parties under the label of the United Ulster Unionist Coalition running agreed candidates in all constituencies, here putting forward the new leader of the Ulster Unionists, Harry West. Although unionist supporters of Sunningdale ran Hubert Brown, West garnered 26,858 votes (43.8%) to Brown's 3,157 (5.1%). The nationalist vote was evenly split with McManus gaining 16,229 votes (26.3%) and Denis Haughey, standing for the new Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), winning 15,410 votes (25.0%). Many believed that an agreed single nationalist candidate could have won the seat. When a second general election was held in October Frank Maguire stood as an Independent Republican with backing from all nationalists, while West was the sole unionist. Maguire gained 32,795 votes (51.8%) to West's 30,285 (47.9%) and 185 (0.3%) for Alan Evans, standing for the Communist Party of Ireland.\n\nThe fine balance of the seat continued in the 1975 elections to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention when UUC gained 52% of the vote (with the small Unionist Party of Northern Ireland gaining an additional 2.3%). In the 1979 general election neither side fielded sole candidates. Maguire was challenged by Austin Currie, a local SDLP activist (and later official candidate) who disagreed with the party's decision to give Maguire a clear run, while the new Ulster Unionist candidate, Raymond Ferguson, was challenged by Ernest Baird, leader of the United Ulster Unionist Party, who sought to cement his new party's electoral position. Additionally the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland ran Peter Acheson. The results were: Maguire 22,398 (36.0%), Ferguson 17,411 (28.0%), Currie 10,785 (17.3%), Baird 10,607 (17.0%) and Acheson 1,070 (1.7%).\n\nMaguire's death led to a by-election in early 1981, when the 1981 Irish hunger strike was underway. The by-election was seized on by supporters of the hunger strike as a way to register a protest and the leader of the hunger strikers, Bobby Sands, was nominated on the label \"Anti-H-Block/Armagh Political Prisoner\". Owen Carron served as his agent and Danny Morrison organised the campaign.\n\nThe Ulster Unionist Party nominated Harry West, who had by now stood down as leader.\n\nThe Social Democratic and Labour Party had already selected Austin Currie as prospective candidate for the seat before a by-election was in prospect. When Sands' candidacy was announced the party came under pressure to withdraw in his favour, as putative candidates Bernadette Devlin-McAliskey and Noel Maguire had done, although initially it was said that the mainstream of the party was resistant. On the last day for nominations the party executive decided not to stand, explaining that they wished to concentrate on local government elections which would take place in May; there was speculation that the executive did not share the local party's confidence and feared a poor result. The SDLP decision not to stand in the by-election caused a great deal of dissent within the party.\n\nNo other candidates contested the seat, making it one of the last occasions when a Westminster constituency had only two candidates. Currie railed against the SDLP's decision not to stand, but the result was a highly polarised contest between unionism and Irish republicanism.\n\nThere were 3,280 spoilt ballot papers.\n\nSands died only twenty-six days later, precipitating a second by-election.

He was born at Nottingham Place, Marylebone, Middlesex. He studied a number of mountainous formations in Great Britain and Continental Europe and arrived at important conclusions about cleavage in rocks.\n\nOrphaned before his first birthday, he was looked after by a half-sister. His mother's family owned a bank in the City of London, and his uncle was Samuel Rogers, the poet and literary figure, so Daniel was not abandoned. At the age of 16 he entered the counting house of a Portuguese merchant in London. At the age of 25, after spending a year in Portugal, he joined his elder brother as a partner in a Portuguese mercantile business.\n\nAs a geologist he first became known by his researches (1832–1840) on the geological structure of the neighbourhood of Lisbon. He studied the Silurian rocks of the Lake District and North Wales (1842–1844), and afterwards investigated the structure of the Alps (1854–1855). He was elected to the Royal Society in 1850.\n\nHe published several essays on cleavage (1847–1852), and showed from the evidence of distortion of organic remains that the direction of the pressure producing contortions in the rocks was perpendicular to the planes of cleavage.\n\nMost of his papers were published in the \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society\", but one \"On the Arrangement of the Foliation and Cleavage of the Rocks of the North of Scotland,\" was printed in the \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\" in 1852. He was author also of a \"Monograph on the Cephalopoda of the Chalk\", published by the Palaeontographical Society (1853–1857). In 1856 he was elected president of the Geological Society of London, but he died in London, from the effects of a riding accident, on 31 May that year.\n"}

She received a Caldecott Honor citation in 2015 for illustrating Barb Rosenstock's \"The Noisy Paint Box: The Colors and Sounds of Kandinsky's Abstract Art\". GrandPré, who creates her artwork with paint and pastels, has illustrated more than twenty books and has appeared in gallery exhibitions and periodicals such as \"The New Yorker\", \"Atlantic Monthly,\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\".\n\nMary GrandPré was born February 13, 1954 in South Dakota. She began drawing when she was five years old, beginning with a reproduction of Walt Disney's cartoon character \"Mickey Mouse\". By age ten, she was imitating Salvador Dalí, experimenting with stretched objects painted with oils, before graduating to copying black-and-white photos from the encyclopedia. She was influenced by the stained glass windows of the church where she attended Mass daily, saying, \"There was a kind of luminous quality about them, a glow, that sometimes comes out in my artwork, whether I mean it to or not.\"\n\nShe was a Fine Arts major at Pomona College and was in her mid-twenties before she considered art school, having supposed illustration to be \"a boring, commercial thing\". She graduated from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 1981.\n\nGrandPré married designer Kevin Whaley when she was young. After they divorced, she attended the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. After her graduation, GrandPré spent several years as a waitress while working to be noticed by ad agencies and attempting to find her own style. Her drawing evolved into what she calls \"soft geometry\", featuring pastels. Her work is created completely by hand, without using a computer.\n\nMary GrandPré has created images for advertising and magazines, including \"The New Yorker\", \"The Atlantic\", and the \"Wall Street Journal\". Among her other famous works, she was commissioned to illustrate the official poster for the 2005 Minnesota State Fair. A DreamWorks executive who enjoyed her work called to invite her to participate as an illustrator for their movie \"Antz\", for which GrandPré was involved with creating some of the landscapes. She has also participated in character development for another animated film. She has taught at The Ringling School of Art and Design.\n\nGrandPré's work on the \"Harry Potter\" novel series came when David Saylor of Scholastic contacted her. Though GrandPré initially declined the assignment due to her schedule, he eventually convinced her to take it. GrandPré says, \"By the time I was working on Book 3, we knew we were dealing with something very special.\" GrandPré illustrated all of the American editions of the \"Harry Potter\" novels. She was one of the few people who were able to read the \"Harry Potter\" books before they were released to the general public. When she received each new book, she read the story through once, highlighting descriptions that she felt would do well as an illustration. She then created various sketches as ideas for the cover and chapter art before sending her favorites to the editors to decide which should appear in the final publication. GrandPré devises her images after reading the scripts for the books, and does not collaborate with or receive input from J.K. Rowling, although the two have met. Her artwork for the final novel in the series, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\", was created using pastels on toned printmaking paper.\n\nIn addition to the \"Harry Potter\" series, she has illustrated picture books including \"Pockets\", \"The Noisy Paint Box\", \"Chin Yu Min and the Ginger Cat\", \"Vegetables Go to Bed\", \"The Thread of Life\", \"Swing Around the Sun\", \"The Sea Chest\", and \"Sweep Dreams\". She also illustrated \"Plum\", and \"Henry and Pawl and the Round Yellow Ball\", which was co-written by her husband, Tom Casmer.\n\nGrandPré's illustrations for \"The Noisy Paint Box\" were recognized by the 2015 Caldecott Medal committee. She was given a Caldecott Honor for her work in this picture book biography of Wassily Kandinsky, evoking his synesthesia. GrandPré's work with the \"Harry Potter\" books has been featured on the cover of \"Time\" magazine. Her work, chosen from thousands of illustrators, has also been featured on the cover of \"Showcase 16\". She has received awards from The Society of Illustrators, \"Communication Arts\", \"Graphis\", \"Print\", and \"Art Direction\", and has been profiled in \"Step-by-Step Graphics\" and \"Communications Arts Magazine\". GrandPré has also been featured in the book \"How Jane Won\", which examines fifty women who have been successful in their chosen career and in their personal lives.\n\nIn 2006, GrandPré began creating art for herself instead of for an assignment. She has donated several pieces to The Wellness Community of Southwest Florida, a non-profit organization providing support for people with cancer. She has also contributed to her local Habitat for Humanity charity by donating pieces and books, as well.\n\nAccording to a November 2003 article in \"Sarasota\" magazine, Grandpré had recently moved to Sarasota, Florida with her husband, Tom Casmer, who had recently taken a position as head of the illustration department at the Ringling School of Art and Design.\n\nIn a June 2007 \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\" article, GrandPré revealed that six months prior, she and her husband went to China, where they adopted a little girl.\n\n\n\n"}

Subsequently, he reconciled with Louis, but soon resumed his intrigues. After twice pardoning him, the king's patience became exhausted, and he besieged the duke's chateau at Carlat and imprisoned him. Nemours was treated with the utmost rigour, being shut up in a cage.

{"id": "1824919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1824919", "title": "Hefty Fine", "text": "Hefty Fine\n\nHefty Fine is the fourth studio album by American alternative rock band Bloodhound Gang, released on September 27, 2005. Produced by Jimmy Pop, it was Bloodhound Gang's third release on Geffen Records following the band's smash hit \"Hooray for Boobies\" which managed to sell over one million copies in the United States and the European Union. It is also the band's last album with original guitarist Lüpüs Thünder and the only album with drummer Willie the New Guy—they were replaced in 2008 and 2006 by A members Daniel P. Carter and Adam Perry, respectively. Compared to other Bloodhound Gang albums, the musical style of \"Hefty Fine\" features a more prominent industrial-rapcore feel, with an electronica texture. The album contains prominent rap metal guitar riffs, electronic instruments, and heavy emphasis on scatological humor.\n\nThe album received poor reviews and holds the dubious accolade of having received the second-worst review on review aggregator website Metacritic. Despite the critical backlash, the album sold well, particularly in Europe, where it debuted in the top ten in Austria, the Netherlands, and Germany. In the US, the album peaked at number 24 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nThree singles were released from the album including \"Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo\", \"Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss\", and \"No Hard Feelings\". The album's first two singles were minor hits, the former charting on six charts, and the latter charting on four.\n\n\"Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo\" was inspired by a joke between Jimmy Pop and \"Evil\" Jared Hasselhoff. Originally, the two had sent each other euphemisms for sexual intercourse via email. The joke later evolved into the song. According to Jimmy Pop, \"Ralph Wiggum\" took the longest to write because it required the band to sift through several scripts of \"The Simpsons\". \"Something Diabolical\" features vocals from Finnish band HIM's lead singer, Ville Valo, who makes reference to the band in the lyric \"Tonight belongs to H.I.M.\" HIM and Bloodhound Gang toured with each other in the 1990s. Eventually, the groups became close and Jimmy Pop offered to distribute HIM's CDs in America. When it came time to record \"Something Diabolical,\" Valo was asked by the band to record some of the vocals. The hidden track is said by Bam Margera of CKY/Jackass/Viva La Bam fame. He can also be seen in the video for \"Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo\" driving a car shaped like a banana, and, despite popular belief, he did not direct the video. RockHard Films director Marc Klasfeld directed the video. \"Balls Out\" can be heard briefly in the car chase scene from \"Drillbit Taylor\".\n\n\"I'm the Least You Can Do\" reuses a piano riff from \"Birthday Boy\", a song by Jimmy Pop's pre-Bloodhound Gang band Bang Chamber 8, released in 1990 on a self-titled demo tape.\n\nThe cover depicts a large, naked Caucasian man, whose genitals are obscured.\n\nThe title and album art each have unique stories. Originally, the album was going to be titled \"Heavy Flow\", but Jimmy Pop discovered that there was a Moby song of the same name. Guitarist Lupus Thunder and Pop have expressed their distaste for Moby in the past. After scrapping \"Heavy Flow\", Lupus Thunder and Jimmy Pop began trading emails that featured the recurring gag \"now that's a hefty fine.\" The band later realized that \"Hefty Fine\" would make a good name for a record. Lupus Thunder, in an interview with \"The News-Times\" said, \"it just clicked in his head and [we're] like, 'Hefty fine? Hold on a minute.'\" Bassist \"Evil\" Jared Hasselhoff and Lupus Thunder have also gone on the record stating that the name could be a play on words meaning an attractive obese person.\n\nAs for the cover art, there are several stories. According to \"Evil\" Jared Hasselhoff, the cover art was originally going to feature an obese African American woman, but Geffen insisted that the band change it. According to former guitarist Lupus Thunder, the cover model, Carlin Langley, was chosen out of several applicants. Potential models were asked to send in a picture and a bio, but Carlin Langley sent in a photograph of himself performing fellatio on another man. The band was impressed by Langley's sense of humor and hired him. Carlin Langley went on to post in the official Bloodhound Gang forums, under the user name \"Hefty Fine.\"\n\nSometime in 2006, Bloodhound Gang launched a campaign to have the Pennsylvania state anthem changed to their song, \"Pennsylvania\". The outcome is unknown. A follow-up single (and its accompanying video) entitled 'Screwing You On The Beach At Night' was released in 2007, an alternate version of the video features former porn actors Till Kraemer and Leonie Saint fornicating while the band is performing around them.\n\n\"Hefty Fine\" was panned by music critics. The review aggregator website Metacritic gave the album an average score of 28/100 from ten reviews, making it the second-worst-reviewed album ever at the website.\n\nOn October 15, 2005, \"Hefty Fine\" debuted and peaked on the \"Billboard\" 200 at number 24, selling 38,066 copies. The next week, the album fell to number 64, selling an additional 23,665 copies. On its sixth, and final week, the album dropped to number 181, disappearing off the chart the following week. The album spent a total of 6 weeks on the chart.\n\nAfter \"No Hard Feelings\" ends, there is four minutes of silence before Bam Margera says \"This is Bam and hidden tracks shit dicks out\" at 9:11.\n\n\n"}

The gardens are open to the public, but closed Mondays and major holidays. Access to the gardens is included in the admission fee to the museum.\n\nToday's gardens form one of the largest Japanese gardens in the world. They were designed by Hoichi Kurisu and constructed between 1999 and 2001 in Morikami Park, a 200-acre (80 hectare) site donated by George Morikami to Palm Beach County and Florida in 1973. The Roji-en gardens are part of the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens, reported to be the only museum in the United States dedicated to the living culture of Japan.\n\nA survey conducted in 2004 by the \"Journal of Japanese Gardening\" ranked the Morikami gardens as the eighth highest-quality public Japanese garden in North America.\n\nA mile-long path leads through six different Japanese gardens, representing six periods of Japanese garden design between the eighth and 20th centuries.

A professor emeritus in the department of philosophy at Auburn University, Machan held the R. C. Hoiles Chair of Business Ethics and Free Enterprise at the Argyros School of Business & Economics at Chapman University in Orange, California until 31 December 2014.\n\nHe was a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, a research fellow at the Independent Institute, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, and an adjunct faculty member of the Ludwig von Mises Institute. Machan was a syndicated and freelance columnist; author of more than one hundred scholarly papers and more than forty books, among them \"Why is Everyone Else Wrong?\" (Springer, 2008). He was, until spring 2015, senior contributing editor at \"The Daily Bell\". He was senior fellow at the Heartland Institute in Arlington Heights, Illinois.\n\nMachan rejected any division of libertarianism into \"left wing\" and \"right wing\". He held that, by its nature, libertarianism is about political liberty for all individuals to do whatever is peaceful and non-aggressive. Machan was a minarchist.\n\nMachan was born in Budapest. Machan's father hired a smuggler to get him out of Hungary when he was 14 years of age and he came to the United States three years later, in 1956. By 1965, Machan graduated from Claremont McKenna College (then Claremont Men's College). He took his Masters of Arts in Philosophy at New York University from 1965 to 1966, and his Ph.D in Philosophy at University of California, Santa Barbara, 1966–1971.\nIn 1970, with Robert W. Poole, Jr. and Manuel Klausner, he purchased \"Reason\" magazine, which has since become the leading libertarian periodical in America. Machan edited \"Reason\" for two years and was the editor of \"Reason Papers\", an annual journal of interdisciplinary normative studies, for 25 years.\n\nHe was a visiting professor at the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1992–1993 and taught at universities in California, New York, Switzerland, and Alabama. He lectured in Europe, South Africa, New Zealand, Budapest, Hungary, Prague, Czech Republic, Azerbaijan, Republic of Georgia, Armenia, and Latin America on business ethics and political philosophy.\n\nHe sat on the advisory boards for several foundations and think tanks, and served on the founding Board of the Jacob J. Javits Graduate Fellowship Program of the U. S. Department of Education. Machan was selected as the 2003 President of the American Society for Value Inquiry, and delivered the presidential address on 29 December 2002, in Philadelphia, at the Eastern Division meetings of the American Philosophical Association, titled \"Aristotle & Business.\" He was on the board of the Association for Private Enterprise Education for several terms.\n\nMachan was an adviser to Freedom Communications, Inc. on libertarian issues from 1996 to 2014.\n\nMachan wrote a memoir, \"The Man Without a Hobby: Adventures of a Gregarious Egoist\" (Hamilton Books, 2004; 2nd edition 2012). On 24 March 2016, he died at the age of 77.\n\nMachan's work usually focused on ethics and political philosophy, specifically natural rights theory, as in works such as \"Individuals and Their Rights\" (Open Court, 1989) and \"Libertarianism Defended\" (Ashgate, 2006). He defended the arguments of Ayn Rand for ethical egoism, and also wrote frequently on business ethics, a field in which he deployed a neo-Aristotelian ethical stance whereby commercial and business conduct gain their moral standing by constituting extensions of the virtues of productivity and prudence. He argued that the field presupposes the institution of the right to private property (one cannot trade what one does not own or hasn't been authorized to trade by the owner) in the works, \"The Business of Commerce, Examining an Honorable Profession\", and \"A Primer on Business Ethics\", both with James Chesher, and \"The Morality of Business, A Profession of Human Wealth Care\" (Springer, 2007).\n\nHis full ethical position was developed in his book \"Classical Individualism: The Supreme Importance of Each Human Being\" (Routledge, 1998), and it is applied in, among other books, \"Generosity: Virtue in Civil Society\" (Cato Institute, 1998).\n\nMachan also wrote in the field of epistemology. His main focus was to challenge the conception of human knowledge whereby to know that P amounts to having reached a final, perfect, timeless, and finished understanding of P. Instead, Machan developed Ayn Rand's contextual conception of human knowledge (from Rand's \"Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology\"), but also draws on the insights of J. L. Austin, from his paper \"Other Minds\", and Gilbert Harman, from his book \"Thought\", in works such as \"Objectivity\" (Ashgate, 2004). Machan worked on the problem of free will and defended a secular, naturalist (but not materialist) notion of human initiative in his books \"The Pseudo-Science of B. F. Skinner\" (1974; 2007) and \"Initiative: Human Agency and Society\" (2000).\n\nMachan argued against animal rights in his widely reprinted paper \"Do Animals Have Rights?\" (1991) and in his book \"Putting Humans First: Why We Are Nature's Favorite\" (2004), but he also wrote on the ethics of animal treatment in his book \"Putting Humans First\" (2004). He was also a skeptic as to whether governments are able to help with global warming and whether human beings have made significant contributions to climate change. On 1 May 2011, Machan was featured in a three-hour interview on C-Span 2's In Depth program as its selection of an author from the Western United States of America.\n\nMachan has argued in a 2008 article that unilateral American intervention has done more harm than good.\n\nMachan lived in Silverado Canyon, California. He was previously married to Marty Zupan. He had three children and four grandchildren.\n\n\n\n"}

As a child he was known as the prince of Genevois. He was the Duke of Nemours from 1585 to his death in 1595, during the French Wars of Religion.\n\nCharles Emmanuel was duke at a volatile time, and subsequently was involved in many political intrigues, mostly by his relationship on his mother's side with the House of Guise. The Duke of Guise was one of the leaders of the Catholic League opposing the Huguenots, and Charles Emmanuel sympathised with their cause. However, after the assassination of Henry I, Duke of Guise and his brother the Cardinal of Guise, Charles Emmanuel was imprisoned by the Huguenots in 1588, but was able to escape.\n\nHe was to fight the Huguenot forces for some years; he fought at the Battle of Arques in 1589. That same year, Charles Emmanuel was the governor of Paris, as the Huguenot forces, led by Henry of Navarre besieged Paris. During the siege, King Henry III of France perished, and Henry of Navarre soon declared himself King Henry IV of France. Charles Emmanuel escaped, and fought the newly proclaimed King at the Ivry in 1590, which was a decisive loss for the Catholic League. The same year he commanded Catholic forces during the Siege of Paris, successfully defending the city.\n\nAfter the defeat, Charles Emmanuel strongly disagreed with his half-brother and long-time ally Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne (also of the House of Guise), who advocated conciliation with Henry IV. Charles Emmanuel withdrew to his government in Lyonnais, where he endeavoured to make himself independent from the French crown. He was imprisoned, however, in the chateau of Pierre-Encise by the archbishop of Lyon. Again, he successfully escaped, and decided to attack Lyon. The intervention of the Constable de Montmorency thwarted his attack however, and his attempt at independence failed.\n\nHe died at Annecy in 1595, leaving the Duchy of Nemour to his brother Henri de Savoie.\n\n"}

{"id": "1824972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1824972", "title": "August Gottlieb Spangenberg", "text": "August Gottlieb Spangenberg\n\nAugust Gottlieb Spangenberg (15 July 170418 September 1792) was a German theologian and minister, and a bishop of the Moravian Brethren. As successor of Count Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf, he helped develop international missions, as well as stabilize the theology and organization of the German Moravian Church.\n\nSpangenberg was born in Klettenberg, now a part of Hohenstein, Thuringia, where his father, Georg Spangenberg, was the pastor and ecclesiastical inspector. Left an orphan at the early age of thirteen, the young Spangenberg attended the \"gymnasium\" (secondary school) at Ilefeld. In 1722 he went on to the University of Jena to study law. Prof. J. F. Buddeus took him into his family, and arranged a scholarship. Spangenberg soon abandoned law for theology, took his degree in 1726, and began to give free lectures on theology.\n\nHe also took an active part in a religious union of students, in supporting free schools for poor children which they established in the suburbs of Jena, and in training teachers. In 1728 Count Zinzendorf visited Jena, and Spangenberg met him. In 1730 he visited the Moravian colony at Herrnhut. He founded a \"collegium pastorale practicum\" for the care of the sick and poor at Jena, which the authorities broke up as a \"Zinzendorfian institution\", seen as a challenge to the state. Spangenberg visited the Moravian colony, whose approach appealed to him.\n\nMeanwhile, his free lectures in Jena were widely accepted. Gotthilf Francke offered him the post of assistant professor of theology and superintendent of schools connected with his orphanage at Halle. He accepted the offer in September 1732. But differences between the Pietists of Halle and him became apparent. He found their religious life too formal, external and worldly. They could not sanction his comparative indifference to doctrine and his tendency to separatism in church life.\n\nBecause of these issues, Spangenberg's taking part in private observances of the Lord's Supper and his connection with Count Zinzendorf brought matters to a crisis. The Senate of the Theological Faculty gave him the alternative of doing penance, submitting to his superiors, and separating from Zinzendorf; or leaving the issue to be settled by the king, unless he preferred to \"leave Halle quietly.\" The case went to the king, who ordered the military to expel Spangenberg from Halle, which they did on 8 April 1733.\n\nAt first he went to Jena, but Zinzendorf sought to secure him as a fellow labourer, though the count wished to obtain from him a declaration which would remove from the Pietists of Halle all blame with regard to the disruption. Spangenberg went to Herrnhut and found his life work among the Moravians. He became the movement's theologian, apologist, statesman and corrector, through sixty long years. The Moravians universally referred to Spangenberg as \"Brother Joseph\" because, like Joseph in Genesis, he took care of his Brethren.\n\nFor the first thirty years (1733-1762), his work was mainly devoted to the supervision and organization of the extensive missions in Germany, England, Denmark, the Netherlands, Suriname, Georgia and elsewhere. One special endeavour of Spangenberg in Pennsylvania was to bring the scattered Schwenkfeldians to his faith. In 1741-1742 he traveled to England to raise funds for his mission and obtain the sanction of the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nDuring the second half of this missionary period of his life, Spangenberg went to Pennsylvania, where as bishop he supervised the Moravian churches. He helped raise money to defend the colonies during the Seven Years' War. In addition, he wrote as an apologist of the Church against the attacks of the Lutherans and the Pietists. He did much to moderate the mysticism of Zinzendorf. His simple, practical nature took a different approach.\n\nThe second thirty years of his work (1762-1792) were devoted to the consolidation of the German Moravian Church. Zinzendorf's death (1760) called for Spangenberg to return to Herrnhut. The Moravian organization needed help. In 1777 Spangenberg was commissioned to draw up the \"Idea Fidei Fratrum\" (Compendium of the Christian faith of the United Brethren). This became the accepted declaration of the Moravian belief. As compared to Zinzendorf's writings, this book exhibits the balance and moderation that Spangenberg expressed.\n\nThe \"Idea Fidei Fratrum\" is an account of doctrine that keeps close to the words of Scripture. There is little in it of abstract theological reasoning. Spangenberg does make his views plain on certain controversial matters. One of these, for instance, is on the question of double predestination, i.e., to damnation as well as salvation. \n\"If we sum up that which hath been deduced from the Scripture concerning the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, we may answer the question, Whether God would have all men to be saved? with a confident, Yes. There is in him the most fervent desire, and the most earnest will that we all should be saved.\"\n\nHe provides numerous texts to justify this position. He notes further that the Saviour suffered the loss of glory and the pains of human life and death in order to save all people. Secondly, the Holy Ghost makes unwearying efforts to reprove the worldly for their sin. \"Would God command all men every where to repent, and yet would not, that all men should be saved? Who can form such a thought of the God of Holiness and Truth?\" \n\nIn his last years Spangenberg devoted special attention to the education of the young. He died at Berthelsdorf on 18 September 1792. He was buried in the \"Herrnhut\" (God's Acre).\n\n\n"}

Conditions in which it is used include skin diseases, rheumatic disorders, allergies, asthma, croup, COPD, certain cancers, multiple sclerosis, and as add-on therapy for tuberculosis. It is given by mouth, by injection into a vein or muscle, or applied to the skin.\nSerious side effects may include mental health problems and an increased risk of infection. Common side effects with long-term use include osteoporosis, cataracts, weakness, easy bruising, and yeast infections. For pregnant women, short-term use around the time of delivery is safe for the baby; however, long-term use during pregnancy may result in harm. Methylprednisolone is in the glucocorticoid family of medication.\nMethylprednisolone was approved for medical use in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Methylprednisolone is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$3.81–9.35 per 500 mg vial. In the United States, a course of treatment typically costs less than . In 2017, it was the 157th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions.\n\nLike most adrenocortical steroids, methylprednisolone is typically used for its anti-inflammatory effects. However, glucocorticoids have a wide range of effects, including changes to metabolism and immune responses. The list of medical conditions for which methylprednisolone is prescribed is rather long and is similar to other corticosteroids such as prednisolone. Common uses include arthritis therapy and short-term treatment of bronchial inflammation or acute bronchitis due to various respiratory diseases. It is used both in the treatment of acute periods and long-term management of autoimmune diseases, most notably systemic lupus erythematosus. It is also used as a treatment for multiple sclerosis, where it can favour recovery from acute attacks.\n\nAnother potential use of methylprednisolone is for vestibular neuritis.\n\nAfter egg retrieval for a cycle of \"in vitro\" fertilization, methylprednisolone may be prescribed to prevent the body from rejecting the embryos being transferred, up to the time of implantation.\n\nLong-term use of methylprednisolone, as with all corticosteroids, can be associated with hyperglycemia, decreased resistance to infection, swelling of face, weight gain, congestive cardiac insufficiency, fluid and sodium retention, edema, hypertension, increased eye pressure, glaucoma, osteoporosis, and psychosis, especially when used at high doses. The most serious side effect occurs after the adrenal glands cease natural production of cortisol, which methylprednisolone will replace. Abrupt cessation of the drug after this occurs can result in a condition known as Addisonian crisis, which can be fatal. To prevent this, the drug is usually prescribed with a tapering dose, including a predosed \"dose pack\" detailing a specific number of tablets to take at designated times over a several-day period. Pharmacists sometimes advise that this drug may cause sleeplessness and \"down\" moods.\n\nMeasles and chicken pox are very dangerous and potentially fatal for people on methylprednisolone therapy. Exposure to these infections is especially risky for people who are not immune to them. Exposures like these should be reported to a physician immediately, and may be treated with prophylactic immunoglobulin. Also, live, attenuated vaccines can be bad for people taking immunosuppressive doses of methylprednisolone. The exception to this rule is patients receiving complete corticosteroid replacement therapy, e.g., for Addison's disease, who may follow standard immunization protocols.\n\nUnbound glucocorticoids cross cell membranes and bind with high affinity to specific cytoplasmic receptors, modifying transcription and protein synthesis. By this mechanism, glucocorticoids can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.\n\nMethylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol) is a suspension administered by IM or intra-articular injection only. It has the potential to cause subcutaneous atrophy in the area administered. Due to the acetate in this formulation, it is important to remember that it should not be given intravenously. The only formulation that can be given intravenously is methylprednisolone succinate (Solu-medrol). Medrol dose packs are prepackaged forms of regular methylprednisolone for oral use.\n\n"}

{"id": "1824987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1824987", "title": "Dead Celebrities", "text": "Dead Celebrities\n\n\"Dead Celebrities\" is the eighth episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated television series \"South Park\". The 189th overall episode of the series, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 7, 2009. In the episode, Ike is haunted by the ghosts of dead celebrities until Michael Jackson, who denies that he is dead, possesses him.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States (specifically for adults, with coarse language). \"Dead Celebrities\" included references to several actors, singers and famous people who died before or in the middle of 2009, when \"South Park\" was on a mid-season hiatus. Among the celebrities featured in the episode were Jackson, Billy Mays, Ed McMahon, Farrah Fawcett, Patrick Swayze, Walter Cronkite, Dom DeLuise, Ted Kennedy, Natasha Richardson, Bea Arthur, David Carradine, DJ AM, Ricardo Montalbán, and Steve McNair. \"Dead Celebrities\" also parodied the films \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"Poltergeist.\"\n\nThe reality series \"Ghost Hunters\" and its stars, Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, were mocked in the episode. Hawes and Wilson said they loved the parody and encouraged fans to watch the show on their Twitter accounts. A subplot claimed food at the Chipotle Mexican Grill resulted in customers defecating blood, a claim which was disputed by the restaurant chain within days of the episode's broadcast. \"Dead Celebrities\" received generally mixed reviews. According to Nielsen ratings, \"Dead Celebrities\" was seen by 2.67 million overall households.\n\nIke is terrified by frequent encounters with the ghosts of recently deceased celebrities. He is haunted by people such as Farrah Fawcett, David Carradine, Ed McMahon, DJ AM, and especially Billy Mays, who repeatedly tries selling Ike products from the afterlife. Kyle is terrified when he finds out about the ghost his brother is encountering and tells Stan, Cartman and Kenny about the encounters. Cartman, who does not initially care, decides to help when Kyle mentions that one of the ghosts haunting Ike is Billy Mays. Cartman then shows commercials that feature Mays on television, implying that he is an enthusiastic supporter of a product which Mays promoted, called \"ChipotlAway\", which cleans bloodstains from people's underwear caused by eating food from Chipotle Mexican Grill. The boys call the team from the reality television series \"Ghost Hunters\" in to help, but they quickly, fearfully start ascribing supernatural meaning to random, ambient, environmental noises, before urinating and defecating on themselves, and finally running from the house. Eventually, Ike goes into a coma because of his multiple experiences with the ghosts.\n\nThe boys seek help from Dr. Philips, a medium (a parody of Zelda Rubinstein's character in \"Poltergeist\"), who explains the celebrities are trapped in purgatory, which she compares to being stuck on a plane waiting endlessly on a runway for permission to take off. Dr. Philips manages to contact the spirits and tell them that they have died. Much to her surprise, the celebrities say that they all accept the fact. CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite and Patrick Swayze tell her that Michael Jackson's refusal to acknowledge his death is the main cause of them being trapped. Some of the celebrities help Dr. Philips and the boys try to convince Jackson that he is dead, but Jackson keeps denying it and insists he is not only alive, but also a little white child. His denial is so strong that he emits a powerful force that flings Dr. Philips out the window of Ike's hospital room, where she falls to her death. The ghosts of these annoyed celebrities are shown in purgatory, which indeed resembles the interior of an airplane, complete with seats, flight attendants and pilot voice-over announcements.\n\nAfter the energy disturbance, Jackson's spirit takes over Ike's body, causing Ike to speak, sing and dance like Jackson himself. The boys find from online research that the only way to make Jackson accept his death is to make him experience the acceptance he sought in life, so they take him to a child beauty pageant for young girls. Dressed like a little girl, Ike/Jackson impresses two of the male judges by singing a tune sounding similar to Jackson's \"You Are Not Alone\", but they are promptly arrested for masturbating while watching the children, leaving a single, unimpressed female judge (much to the shock of the boys, who were unaware of the men's lewd acts and considered them the best judges). When Cartman notices the judge eating chipotle, he bribes her with knowledge about the ChipotlAway product, and she declares Ike/Jackson the winner as a result. One of the other contestants is physically beaten by her mother for losing. Having found his acceptance, Jackson leaves Ike's body, and Ike is extremely surprised and disgusted to find himself dressed like a little girl.\n\nLater on, Jackson and the other celebrities in purgatory are reunited and they are finally able to lift off. Initially happy, they are soon taken to Hell. To their annoyance, however, the flight attendant tells them that they must again wait as Hell is a tow-in gate.\n\n\"Dead Celebrities\" was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It first aired on October 7, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. The day after \"Dead Celebrities\" was originally broadcast, T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode were made available at \"South Park Studios\", the official \"South Park\" website. It featured a frightened Ike standing above the phrase, \"I see dead celebrities\".\n\n\"Dead Celebrities\" includes references to several actors, singers and other celebrities who died in the middle of 2009, when the thirteenth season of \"South Park\" was on a mid-season hiatus. The episode serves not only to parody the celebrities themselves, but also to provide commentary on the tendency of American media to exploit, idolatrize and excessively report on the lives of celebrities. The most prominently featured of these celebrities is pop singer Michael Jackson, who died of multiple drug intoxication on June 25.\n\nBilly Mays, a television advertisement salesman, is the first dead celebrity featured in the episode, and plays a large role in the early part of the script. Mays' son, Billy Mays III, a self-proclaimed \"South Park\" fan, said he loved \"Dead Celebrities\", and found its portrayal of his father tasteful and respectful. He said, \"South Park gets a little edgy sometimes, but at their core, they're just social satire, you know? I think it was natural for them to do a dead celebrities episode with this whole summer and how it's been, and I think the way they did it was pretty tasteful for the most part.\" The spirit of David Carradine is shown wearing lingerie and with a noose around his neck, a reference to his June 3, 2009, death by autoerotic asphyxiation. Among the others featured in the episode were actress Farrah Fawcett, journalist Walter Cronkite, disc jockey Adam Goldstein (DJ AM), politician Ted Kennedy, actress Beatrice Arthur, television personality Ed McMahon, actor Patrick Swayze, actress Natasha Richardson, hot dog magnate Oscar G. Mayer, Jr. and actor/chef Dom DeLuise.\n\n\"Dead Celebrities\" makes frequent mention of the Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant chain, describing the food as extremely tasty, but claiming it resulted in bloody stool. Shortly after the episode first aired, a Chipotle spokesperson said via a Twitter message that the claim was false. In the episode's commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone admitted that they loved Chipotle, but found it funnier to use a restaurant with a healthy reputation rather than a place like McDonald's or Taco Bell. Ike's ability to see the spirits of dead celebrities serves as a parody of the 1999 thriller film \"The Sixth Sense\", which stars Haley Joel Osment as a young boy who can see ghosts. Ike's line, \"I see dead celebrities\", is a reference to that film's most famous line, \"I see dead people.\" The old lady psychic with a very high-pitched voice is a reference to the character played by Zelda Rubinstein in the 1982 horror film, \"Poltergeist\". Another film reference is made to \"The Exorcist\" when the medium is flung from the window. \"Dead Celebrities\" also mocks the Syfy reality television series \"Ghost Hunters\" by featuring the show's stars attempting to contact the celebrity spirits, only to be frightened and run away. Finally, the episode also parodies children's beauty pageants and the tendency of stage mothers to become unhealthily obsessed with their children winning such contests.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on October 7, 2009, \"Dead Celebrities\" was watched by 2.67 million overall households, according to Nielsen ratings. It received a 1.8 rating/3 share, and a 1.5 rating/4 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49.\n\nThe episode received generally mixed reviews. Ramsley Isler of \"IGN\" called \"Dead Celebrities\" one of the best episodes of the season, adding the jokes at the expense of the deceased were not too tasteless. He praised the parodies of \"The Sixth Sense\", \"Poltergeist\" and \"Ghost Hunters\", but said some jokes, like the masturbating judges at the children's beauty contest, were offensive and unfunny. Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, stars of \"Ghost Hunters\", declared that \"far from being offended or incensed [...] they loved being made fun of alongside Michael Jackson and Billy Mays. Carlos Delgado of \"iF Magazine\" said \"Dead Celebrities\" was an especially funny episode that also featured a \"crapload of story\" that was well-timed for the Halloween season. Josh Modell of \"The A.V. Club\" called it \"a decent episode\", but felt the dead celebrities were too obvious targets for \"South Park\" satire, adding, \"It's easy to make the same jokes that the rest of the world already has.\" Modell said the \"Sixth Sense\" and \"Poltergeist\" references \"fell a little flat\", but he praised the Chipotle subplot, which he called \"beautifully random [and] totally ridiculous\". Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said the episode was in bad taste, but added, \"I laughed until I choked\". Tucker described the Michael Jackson impersonation as \"first-rate\" and felt the solution to freeing Jackson's spirit served as \"a ruthless parody of child beauty pageants\".\n\nIngela Ratledge of \"TV Guide\" favorably described the episode as the exact opposite of award show segments that reverentially pay homage to the year's departed celebrities, calling it \"a wonderfully tasteless farewell.\" Sue Bergerstein, an arts and celebrity writer with \"Examiner.com\", called \"Dead Celebrities\" a \"new low\" for \"South Park\", adding \"It's not only tasteless but this episode just adds to the sadness currently experienced by all the mourning relatives.\" \"Newsweek\" writer Joshua Alston said few of the jokes in \"Dead Celebrities\" were funny, and so the mocking of celebrities \"in the absence of laughs, felt tasteless and unnecessary\". Alan Sepinwall, television journalist with \"The Star-Ledger\", said many of the episodes seemed rehashed and predictable, especially those targeting Michael Jackson and children's beauty pageants. Sepinwall added he liked the Chipotle subplot, but commented, \"Overall, 'Dead Celebrities' was a misfire.\"\nMitch Norton of the SLC Cartoon Analysis found the episode to be extremely funny. \"Genius is not only found in the reference to the deaths of celebrities, but creates a new way to view death as a way to live on. We can view death as the end, or a new beginning to something else.\"\n\n\"Dead Celebrities\", along with the thirteen other episodes from \"South Park\"'s thirteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on March 16, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode, a collection of deleted scenes, and a special mini-feature \"Inside Xbox: A Behind-the-Scenes Tour of South Park Studios\", which discussed the process behind animating the show with \"Inside Xbox\" host Major Nelson.\n\nA deleted scene from this episode is included on the complete thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets. It shows the boys taking Michael Jackson (in Ike's body) to the Glendale location of Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries to prove he is dead. When they reach the grave, Jackson denies it and Kyle attempts to show him by taking a shovel and digging his grave. Stan at first opposes but he, with Cartman and Kenny take shovels and the scene ends with the boys digging Jackson's grave to show he is dead while Ike/Jackson dances. The reason this scene was cut was due to Jackson's grave inaccurately shows his date of death as July 25, 2009.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1824992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1824992", "title": "Corixidae", "text": "Corixidae\n\nCorixidae is a family of aquatic insects in the order Hemiptera. They are found worldwide in virtually any freshwater habitat and a few species live in saline water. There are about 500 known species worldwide, in 33 genera, including the genus \"Sigara\".\n\nMembers of the Corixidae are known in the United States as water boatmen, a term that is sometimes used in the United Kingdom for \"Notonecta glauca\", an insect of a different family, Notonectidae, and \"Corixa punctata\" is the \"lesser water boatman\".\n\nCorixidae generally have a long flattened body ranging from long. Many have extremely fine dark brown or black striations marking the wings. They tend to have four long rear legs and two short front ones. The hind legs are covered with hairs and shaped like oars, hence the name \"water boatman\". Their four hindmost legs have scoop- or oar-shaped tarsi to aid swimming. They also have a triangular head with short, triangular mouthparts. Corixidae dwell in slow rivers and ponds, as well as some household pools.\n\nUnlike their relatives the backswimmers (Notonectidae), who swim upside down, Corixidae swim right side up. It is easy to tell the two types of insects apart simply by looking at the swimming position.\n\nCorixidae are unusual among the aquatic Hemiptera in that they are mostly non-predatory, feeding on aquatic plants and algae instead of insects and other small animals. They use their straw-like mouthparts to inject enzymes into plants. The enzymes digest the plant material, letting the insect suck the liquified food back through its mouthparts and into its digestive tract. A few species will eat small invertebrates such as larvae of Nematocera, but the family is primarily herbivorous.\n\nSome species within this family are preyed upon by a number of amphibians including the rough-skinned newt, \"Taricha granulosa\".\n\nThe reproductive cycle of Corixidae is annual. Eggs are typically oviposited (deposited) on submerged plants, sticks, or rocks. In substrate limited waters (waters without many submerged oviposition sites), every bit of available substrate will be covered in eggs.\nThese 55 genera belong to the family Corixidae:\n\n\n"}

She became known in 2003, after the release of the film \"Thirteen\", directed by Catherine Hardwicke, for which she was credited with Hardwicke as a co-writer of the screenplay, and in which she played a lead role. The film earned Reed an Independent Spirit Award for Best Debut Performance, as well as several nominations.\n\nReed was born in West Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Cheryl Houston, a beautician, and Seth Reed, a production designer. She has an older brother, Nathan August Reed, and a younger half-brother, Joey Reed. Her mother is a Christian of Cherokee and Italian descent, and her father is Jewish. Reed was raised without religion and has identified as Jewish. She grew up around some Jewish practices, as her brother had a Bar Mitzvah.\n\nReed has said in numerous interviews that her early home life was \"complicated\". Her parents divorced when Reed was two, and she was raised by her mother. In 2002, when Reed was 14 years old, she moved out of her mother's house and began living on her own, mainly in apartments in the Los Angeles area. After \"Thirteen\"s success, Reed returned to Alexander Hamilton High School in Los Angeles, but dropped out again after a year. She said that \"mothers who were sneaking into the school at lunchtime to confront and harass her about the film\" were the reason for her departure. She earned a high school diploma through homeschooling. She is a vegetarian.\n\nCatherine Hardwicke, a friend of her mother's, invited her to work on a script with her, when Reed said she was interested in acting. They finished the script for the semi-autobiographical film \"Thirteen\" in six days. Producers asked Reed to play a role in the film because they had trouble casting it, as it was an \"uncomfortable\" role for most young actresses.\nThe film, starring Evan Rachel Wood, was released in 2003 to positive reviews, gaining Reed some recognition in Hollywood as both a screenwriter and an actress. Following this, Reed was invited to appear on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" and serve as host on a number of award shows, including the \"Young Hollywood Awards\" (2003) and the \"Independent Spirit Awards Nomination Show\", followed by the West Independent Spirits Awards, both in 2004. Reed has repeatedly been cast as sexually advanced, precocious teenagers, including her character in \"Lords of Dogtown\" (2005), also directed by Hardwicke. In early 2006, she appeared on the series \"The O.C.\", playing Sadie, a new love interest for the character Ryan Atwood. Reed later appeared on \"The O.C.\" at the same time as future \"Twilight\" co-stars Cam Gigandet and Jackson Rathbone.\n\nReed said that her early decision to avoid acting in television series or in mainstream cinema was naïve. She had thought at the time they were not right for her, but had since gained valuable experience in them. She had a lead role in \"Mini's First Time\", which received a limited release in the United States on July 14, 2006. Reed played a teenager who, through seduction, involves her stepfather in a plot to murder her mother. Reed has noted that her character does not \"understand the weight of consequence\". She said she had enjoyed playing someone who she describes as \"crass\" and having a \"trucker's mouth\". Reed's character has sex scenes. As Reed was 16 at the time and legally unable to film such scenes in an explicit way, she was filmed from the back to hide her face. On February 12, 2008, it was announced that Reed would portray Rosalie Hale in the film adaption of \"Twilight\", the first book of a popular four-novel series. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke, it became an international success.\n\nIn 2010, Jason Mewes said that he was doing a movie called \"K-11\" with Reed and Kristen Stewart, also of \"Twilight\". The film, directed by Stewart's mother, takes place in a dorm of the Los Angeles County Jail. It was to feature both Stewart and Reed as female characters. Later that year, Reed said that she was no longer part of the project. In July 2010, Reed joined the cast of the lady assassin action-drama \"Catch .44,\" alongside Bruce Willis, Forest Whitaker and Malin Akerman. In November 2010, it was announced that Reed would star with Hayden Panettiere in the film \"Downers Grove\", a movie adaptation of Michael Hornburg's novel. The screenplay was written by Bret Easton Ellis, the novelist who wrote \"The Rules of Attraction\" and \"American Psycho\".\n\nIn December 2011, it was announced that Reed joined the cast of \"Pawn\", an indie crime thriller directed by David A. Armstrong. The film also stars Forest Whitaker, Ray Liotta, Common, Michael Chiklis, Sean Faris, Stephen Lang, Marton Csokas and Jessica Szohr. In July 2013, Reed joined the cast of the independent sports comedy \"Balls Out,\" alongside Jake Lacy, Kate McKinnon, Beck Bennett and Jay Pharoah. The film is about a group of college friends who get together in their final year to play a game of intramural football.\n\nReed recorded a song, \"Now That I've Found You\", with her then-husband Paul McDonald, which debuted on Ryan Seacrest's radio show on November 15, 2011. The couple released their first EP, \"The Best Part\", on October 29, 2012. Their song \"All I've Ever Needed\" is on .\n\nIn January 2013, Reed filmed Hanson's 2013 music video for their single, \"Get the Girl Back\", also with McDonald. The video was released in April 2013. Other well-known figures in the video include Kat Dennings, Drake Bell, Drew Seeley, Amy Paffrath, and Alex Beh.\n\nReed wrote a script set in New Zealand between the 1960s and the 1980s. She has said she feels more versatile than her typecasting in roles of \"sexy bad girls.\" She has sometimes been told by producers that she is too \"sexy\" for a particular part. In November 2009, Reed directed a music video for her friend Sage while in London. Reed stated that they didn't have much time, or money, but she takes great pride in it. Reed also intends to direct a music video for the independent rock band 100 Monkeys, which is fronted by her \"Twilight\" co-star, Jackson Rathbone.\n\nReed met Paul McDonald, a singer-songwriter and former \"American Idol\" contestant, on the red carpet at the premiere of \"Red Riding Hood\" in March 2011. This moment was broadcast on an \"American Idol\" episode as part of a segment that showed the contestants attending the premiere. The couple began dating, and moved in together not long after. They confirmed their engagement in June 2011, and married on October 16, 2011, in Malibu, California. In March 2014, Reed and McDonald announced that they had separated after living apart for the previous six months due to \"work obligations\". Reed filed for divorce in May 2014, and the divorce was finalized on January 2, 2015.\nReed began dating actor Ian Somerhalder in mid-2014. They confirmed their engagement in February 2015, and married on April 26, 2015, in Malibu, California. On May 4, 2017, the couple announced via Instagram that Reed was pregnant with their first child. They had their child, a daughter on July 25, 2017.\n\nReed is close friends with her \"Twilight\" co-star Jackson Rathbone and \"Spy Kids\" actress Alexa Vega, who was her matron of honor at her first wedding.\n\nReed teamed up with Staples and Do Something for their third Annual School Supply Drive in the summer of 2011. She is also an animal rights advocate. She volunteers at animal shelters in her free time and she designed a limited edition collar and leash for Gilt to benefit Aspca. On October 22, 2014, she was honored with the ASPCA Compassion Award for her contributions to animal welfare.\n\nReed endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn 2017, Reed and friend Morgan Bogle set up a sustainable jewelry brand BaYou With Love.

The constituency elects 5 deputies (Teachtaí Dála, commonly known as TDs). The method of election is the single transferable vote form of proportional representation (PR-STV).\n\nThe constituency is located in the southern part of South Dublin county. One of this name was first created in the 1940s and was used for elections from 1948 to 1973 inclusive. The original constituency was based around the areas of Ballyfermot, Crumlin and Kilmainham. The constituency was then abolished and was mostly replaced by the Dublin Ballyfermot constituency. In its current incarnation the seat was created in 1981 and had completely different boundaries from the original pre-1977 constituency, being based around the areas of Clondalkin, Newcastle, Rathcoole, Saggart, Tallaght, Templeogue, and parts of Terenure.\n\nIn 1998, it was reduced in size and electorate, losing territory—including Newcastle, Rathcoole, Saggart and Clondalkin—to the new Dublin Mid-West seat. Major areas today include Rathfarnham, Tallaght, and Templeogue, with the surrounding suburbs of Ballyboden, Ballyroan, Butterfield, Firhouse, Greenhills, Knocklyon, Willbrook, and parts of Terenure.

With the departure of Brian Hayes in 2014, the constituency was entirely represented by four left of centre TDs upon the election of Paul Murphy of the Anti-Austerity Alliance in the 2014 by-election.\n\nThe constituency is noted for its volatility: in three consecutive general elections, the poll topper from the previous election lost his seat, Brian Hayes in 2002, Seán Crowe in 2007 and Conor Lenihan in 2011.\n\nFollowing the death of Fianna Fáil TD Noel Lemass, a by-election was held on 10 June 1976.

It drew its electorate from the abolished constituencies of Dublin County West, Dublin Ballyfermot and Dublin Cabra together with a small part of Dublin South-East.

He was born in Virolahti. Many of his works are related to the Kalevala. He was influenced by French and Spanish music, and especially by Maurice Ravel, for whom he had a particular esteem.\n\nThe core of Klami's oeuvre consists of an assortment of works related to the Finnish national epic, the \"Kalevala\", among the most notable being: the five-movement \"Kalevala sarja\" (\"Kalevala Suite\"; 1933, r. 1943), inspired by Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\"; the symphonic poem, \"Lemminkäisen seikkailut saaressa\" (\"Lemminkäinen’s Island Adventures\"; 1934); and, the unfinished ballet, \"Pyörteitä\" (\"Whirls\"), which survives as two suites. As central to Klami's legacy is the six-movement orchestral suite, \"Merikuvia\" (\"Sea Pictures\"; 1932); the \"Karelian Rhapsody\" (1927); and, \"Psalmus\" (1936), an oratorio for soloists, mixed, chorus and orchestra. He also wrote two numbered symphonies, in 1938 and 1945, respectively, as well as two piano concerti (1925, 1945), a Violin Concerto (1943), and the \"Cheremissian Fantasy\" for cello and orchestra (1931).\n\nHe participated in five armed conflicts, including two wars in Karelia, the Finnish Civil War, the Winter War of 1939–40 and the Continuation War of 1941–44.\n\nKlami studied music in Helsinki with Erkki Melartin and later in Paris and Vienna. Klami's \"Karelian Rhapsody\", part of his first composition concert in 1928, was a \"succès de scandale\" that brought him considerable attention. His main works include the \"Kalevala Suite\" and the unfinished ballet \"Whirls\". The oratorio \"Psalmus\" (1936) has a unique place in Finnish sacred music and is one of the most highly regarded works by a Finn other than Sibelius. Klami also experimented with the symphonic form in his two Symphonies (1938 and 1945) and \"Symphonie enfantine\" (1927), and the concerto form in his two Piano Concertos (No. 1 \"Une nuit à Montmartre\" and No. 2 for Piano and Strings) and the Violin Concerto (1943). Being a master of miniature orchestral works, the orchestral suite \"Sea Pictures\" is also regarded as one of his major achievements. On the recommendation of Sibelius he was granted a small lifetime income from the government. In 1959 he was made a member of the Finnish Academy (one of Finland's highest honors).\n\nKlami died of a heart attack in Virolahti at age 60 while sailing his favorite boat \"Miina\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1825029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825029", "title": "Sylvestrines", "text": "Sylvestrines\n\nThe Sylvestrines are a congregation of monks of the Order of St. Benedict who form the Sylvestrine Congregation. The Sylvestrines use the post-nominal initials O.S.B. Silv.. The congregation was founded in 1231 by Sylvester Gozzolini. They are members of the Benedictine Confederation. The congregation is similar to others of eremetical origin, in that their houses are not raised to the status of an abbey, which would entangle the monasteries more strongly in the affairs of the world. The congregation, though, is led by an abbot general, the only abbot it has, who supervises all the houses of the congregation.\n\nThe founder, Sylvester Gozzolini(1177–1267), was born at Osimo near Ancona, Italy. As a young man he entered a community of Augustinian canons regular, who served Osimo Cathedral, and eventually was professed in that Order and received Holy Orders. About 1227 he left the community to lead an austere, eremitical life. Disciples flocked to him, however, and in 1231 he built a hermitage by the mountain of Montefano in the March of Ancona (near the town of Fabriano). The congregation was approved in 1247 by Pope Innocent IV as the \"Ordo S. Benedicti de Montefano\". \n\nThe community that Sylvester founded followed the Rule of St. Benedict, but, as regards poverty in external matters, was far stricter than the general Benedictines of the time. At Sylvester's death in 1267, there were eleven Sylvestrine monasteries. At their peak, there were 56 monasteries in the congregation, mostly in Umbria and Tuscany, as well as in the March of Ancona. The Church of San Marco in Florence belonged to the Sylvestrines, but in 1437 through the efforts of Cosimo de' Medici, they were displaced in favor of the Dominicans, and moved to the smaller San Giorgio alla Costa.\n\nLike all religious communities in Europe, the Sylvestrines suffered throughout the 19th century from the upheavals of the French Revolutionary Army and the later unification of Italy. Their principal house was the Monastery of Santo Stefano del Cacco in Rome, dedicated to St. Stephen the Protomartyr, which was founded in 1563 to serve as the motherhouse of the congregation. The community there had about 60 choir monks at that time. By 1907 there were only nine Sylvestrine communities. \n\nNotable Sylvestrine include the founder, Sylvester Gozzolini, Bonfilius of Foligno, Bl. Giovanni del Bastonne, and the Bl. Giuseppe and Ugo di Serra San Quirico.\n\nFor most of its history, the Congregation was confined to Italy. The Ceylon Mission was begun in 1845, their first foundation outside Europe. The Sylvestrines provided many of the clergy for that missionary diocese well into the 20th century. Additionally, they have monasteries in the United States, the first being established in Atchison, Kansas, where two monks arrived in 1910 and served the spiritual needs of the many workers in the coal industry there. As that industry faded and the local population began to move away, they looked elsewhere to build a permanent home. They were welcomed into the Archdiocese of Detroit in 1928, where they built their first monastery in the country in 1938, St. Benedict of Oxford Monastery which serves as the orders headquarters in the United States. There is a daughter house Holy FaceMonastery in Clifton, New Jersey.\n\nA conventual priory was founded in 1962 in Australia at Arcadia, Sydney, by an Italian monk serving in Sri Lanka. There are now also monasteries in India. In the late 20th century, a foundation was set up in the Philippines and, more recently, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe Sylvestrine monks operated as a completely autonomous congregation for most of their history, until they joined the Benedictine Confederation in 1973. This placed the congregation under the general supervision of the abbot primate of the Benedictine Order, and joined them to the life of the entire Order throughout the world. As of 2020, there are three monasteries in Italy (Montefano, Bassano, and Giulianova). \n\nIn September 2007 Dom Michael Kelly, O.S.B., a monk of the Australian monastery, was elected as the 115th abbot general of the congregation. On 28 May 2019, he was succeeded by Father Antony Puthenpurackal OSB of Saint Joseph’s Conventual Priory, Makkiyad, India.\n\nOne distinguishing mark of the Sylvestrines continues to be that their habit is dark blue, as opposed to the standard black worn by most other Benedictines. Additionally, they distinguish themselves from other Benedictines by adding the abbreviation \"Silv.\" after the standard postnominal initials of the Order, O.S.B. Since they joined the Benedictine Confederation, however, that practice is seldom followed.\n\n"}

{"id": "1825069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825069", "title": "Almighty Vice Lord Nation", "text": "Almighty Vice Lord Nation\n\nThe Almighty Vice Lord Nation (Vice Lords for short, abbreviated AVLN) is the second largest and one of the oldest street gangs in Chicago, Illinois. Its total membership is estimated to be between 30,000 and 35,000. It is also one of the founding members of the People Nation multi-gang alliance.\n\nIn 1957, the Vice Lords gang was founded by several African American youths originally from the North Lawndale neighborhood of Chicago. These youths met while incarcerated in the Illinois State Training School for Boys in St. Charles (also known as the St. Charles Juvenile Correctional Facility). At the time, they were led by founding member Edward \"Pepalo\" Perry. The name \"vice\" was chosen when a gang founder looked up the term in the dictionary and found the meaning as \"having a tight hold\".\n\nAs the original Vice Lords group were released from incarceration, they quickly began to recruit other youths from their neighborhood and began engaging in conflicts with other \"clubs\" from various Chicago neighborhoods. By 1964, they had grown significantly and law enforcement named them as a primary target for their various illegal activities, including robbery, theft, assaults, battery, intimidation, and extortion. They were noted for their violent behavior \n\nIn an attempt at softening their public image, a leader of one of the original 8 Vice Lord sets changed the gang's name to \"Conservative Vice Lords\", which today serves as the foundation of the entire Vice Lord Nation. They developed new logos and advertised themselves as a community outreach group. They went as far as to petition for a community outreach chapter named \"Conservative Vice Lord Incorporated\". This attempt was successful enough that the group began to receive a large amount of positive publicity from various politicians and community leaders. CVL, Inc. established a number of recreational areas for neighborhood children which were then used as meeting houses after they had closed for the day.\n\nIn 1970, two Vice Lord leaders, Alfonso Alfred and Bobby Gore, applied for a $275,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. The Rockefeller Foundation approved the grant. This particular era of the CVL is documented in the 1970 film, \"Lord Thing\", by Chicago filmmaker DeWitt Beall. Those featured in the film include Bobby Gore, Kenneth \"Goat\" Parks, Eddy \"Pepilo\" Perry, Don McIlvaine, Leonard Sengali and William Franklin.\n\nAt the same time, the gang was successfully consolidating smaller neighborhood gangs (including the Cherokees, the Morphines, the Commanches, the Continental Pimps, the Imperial Chaplains, the Clovers, the Cobras, and the Braves) into the Vice Lord Nation. As a result, their numbers swelled significantly. In spite of the positive press, it was soon discovered that the Vice Lords were still violent criminals. An introduction of narcotics into the Lawndale neighborhood during this time, along with a rapid increase in crimes involving intimidation, extortion, and murders of business owners who refused to pay for \"protection\" were perpetuated by the gang.\n\nAfter public pressure, a federal investigation into CVL, Inc.'s use of the Rockefeller grant money was conducted and as a result, several leaders were arrested and sent to prison. By the early 1980s, Perry and Alfred were dead and Gore was in prison for murder. The younger Vice Lord leadership attempted to conceal the gang's true intentions with another camouflage campaign, this time by adopting Islamic ideologies. By the mid-1990s, they had created a large document called Lords of Islam which addressed new rules for the gang. Their headquarters, located near Pulaski and 16th Street, is referred to as the \"Holy City\".\n\nIn the 1990s, the VL's, while engaging in the usual activities, became much more sophisticated and expanded into mortgage fraud, credit card fraud, and money laundering.\n\nVice Lord street gangs use a variety symbols to identify themselves, including a rabbit wearing a bow tie (the \"Playboy\" logo).they show a top hat with a cane\n\nAs a teenager growing up on Chicago's West Side in the 1960s, Willie Lloyd joined the Unknown Vice Lords, a faction based along 16th Street in the Lawndale neighborhood. Lloyd soon became the faction's leader and recruited thousands of followers. Eventually he proclaimed himself \"King of Kings\" and stated that he was the leader of the entire Vice Lord Nation. However, his tenure was interrupted by a prison term for his part in the murder of a police officer in Iowa.\n\nLloyd continued to lead the gang on the outside through fellow inmates and prison employees affiliated with the gang. While incarcerated, Lloyd wrote \"The Amalgamated Order of Lordism\", a 61-page manifesto on the Vice Lord command structure in the prisons and on the streets. He was incarcerated in 1971 until his release on parole in 1986, then was back in prison a year later on a weapons conviction until another parole in 1992. When he left prison in 1992, he was picked up by fellow gang members dressed in furs who were driving a convoy of five limousines.\n\nLater in 1992, he was involved in a protracted gang war over control of the Vice Lord Nation, involving kidnapping and the murder of rival members' children. Law enforcement intensified its efforts to remove Lloyd from the street, and from 1994 to 2001, he was again incarcerated for weapons violations.\n\nDuring Lloyd's quarter-century as gang leader, Vice Lord drug deals, extortion and other crimes reportedly led to thousands of homicides. In 1996, police had supposedly linked every murder committed in Chicago's 15th district back to orders from Lloyd.\n\nLloyd publicly quit the Vice Lords after his release from prison, and became an outspoken critic of gang life. Lloyd attempted to earn a living as a gang mediator, and he became affiliated with a non-profit organization. He was briefly a guest lecturer for a class called \"Street Gangs in Chicago\" at DePaul University, which was controversial, in part, due to field trips in which Lloyd took the students to the West Side.\n\nIn August 2003, Lloyd was shot four times in Garfield Park. This was the third assassination attempt on Lloyd. Lloyd became paralyzed from the neck down due to injuries from the shooting. Rumors persisted that Lloyd still wanted to collect a \"tax\" from the Vice Lords as its leader, even though he had supposedly left gang life. Lloyd has given interviews stating that he believes his attackers included some of his former henchmen. Lloyd died in 2005 aged 64.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1825076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825076", "title": "Martin Edwards", "text": "Martin Edwards\n\nCharles Martin Edwards (born 24 July 1945) is the former chairman of Manchester United, a position he held from 1980 until 2002. He now holds the position of honorary life president at the club and Director of Inview Technology Ltd.\n\nEdwards was born in Adlington, Cheshire, England. At thirteen, he failed the entrance exam for Stowe School, his parents' first choice, and went to Cokethorpe instead. He left in 1963 with six O levels.\n\nHe was elected to the Manchester United board in March 1970. He became chairman on 22 March 1980 following the sudden and unexpected death of his father Louis on 25 February, who had been chairman for the previous 15 years. When the Football Association voted to allow football clubs to have one paid director, on 5 January 1982 he became Chief Executive and paid himself an annual salary of £30,000.\n\nDuring the season when Edwards took over as chairman, United finished runners-up to Liverpool in the Football League First Division, but had not won the league title since 1967 and had not won a major trophy at all in three seasons of Dave Sexton's management. At the end of the 1980–81 season, United finished eighth in the league after seven successive wins at the end of the season. Manager Dave Sexton was looking set to be offered a new three-year contract, but the deal was never signed and Edwards sacked Sexton after four trophyless seasons as manager.\n\nEdwards then began the hunt for a new manager. There was talk that he would appoint Lawrie McMenemy, who had guided Southampton to a shock win over United in the FA Cup final five years earlier, as successor to Dave Sexton. It was also rumoured that United were interested in recruiting Brian Clough, a league title winner and twice a European Cup winner with Nottingham Forest, but Edwards insisted that he would not be approaching Clough. He instead turned to Ron Atkinson, whose impressive West Bromwich Albion side had qualified for the UEFA Cup three times in four seasons with top-five league finishes, reaching the quarter-finals on one occasion. Atkinson insisted in his footballing biography published in 1999 that Edwards was the best chairman he worked for, and he accepted the offer, and soon after this appointment, Edwards made the funds available for Atkinson to bring in Albion's midfielder Bryan Robson for a national record fee of £1.5 million. This national record would remain unbroken by English clubs for six years, and Robson went on to be one of the club's greatest ever players.\n\nAtkinson guided United to two FA Cup glories (the first in 1983 and the second in 1985) but in the 1985–86 season United faded away to finish fourth after a 10-match winning start to the league season, and speculation about his future as manager was mounting.\n\nIn 1983, Edwards had begun looking for younger colleagues to introduce to the club's board. Sir Matt Busby had been appointed president of the club and Michael Edelson was appointed to replace him on the board by Edwards, followed in June 1984 by the addition of club solicitor Maurice Watkins and club legend Bobby Charlton.\n\nIn the summer of 1986, Edwards generated £2.3 million (a record fee involving a British club, though Robson's record set in 1981 had yet to be broken by a British club) from the sale of striker Mark Hughes to Barcelona of Spain.\n\nOn 4 November 1986, United were floundering in the bottom half of the top division and that night were eliminated from the Football League Cup with a 4–1 defeat at Southampton. The following day, the four man board convened in Edwards' Old Trafford office and decided a change of manager had to be made. The unanimous decision was to see if Alex Ferguson, then manager of Aberdeen F.C. in the Scottish league was available. According to Ferguson's autobiography, he received a telephone call in his office at Pittodrie from a man with a Scottish accent. He subsequently discovered that this was Manchester United director Michael Edelson who asked Ferguson if he would be interested in meeting Edwards. Following a short discussion, Edwards made contact with Aberdeen F.C. chairman Dick Donald and the four man United board drove immediately to meet Ferguson halfway between the two cities in Glasgow. Negotiations were quickly concluded and 72 hours later Ferguson was installed as manager of Manchester United.\n\nHe rejected a £10m bid for the club by Robert Maxwell in 1984. In 1989, he tried to sell the club to the property developer Michael Knighton for £20m. The sale collapsed when after being given access to the club's books Knighton was unable to raise the funds to pay for the club. However, Knighton was still given a seat on the board, and sources at the time suggested that this was in exchange for keeping quiet about what he had seen in the books.\n\nAfter the failed sale the club's other directors persuaded Edwards to float the club on the stock market. This raised significant funds the majority for the existing shareholders such as Edwards. Being a public company did not have the stabilising effect that was originally hoped for. The club has been subject to takeover proposals by Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB with Edwards reportedly agreeing to sell his stake for £98 million. Edwards gradually disposed of his equity in the club and resigned as Chief Executive in 2000, appointing Peter Kenyon as his successor.\n\nMeanwhile, his efforts helped Manchester United enjoy some of the finest moments of their history during the 1990s and 2000s. The appointment of Alex Ferguson as manager in 1986 was indeed the turning point in United's history after two decades of relative mediocrity, but it took time for things to improve.\n\nUnited finished second in the league in 1987–88 (Ferguson's first full season as manager), and around this time Edwards had made millions of pounds available to strengthen the squad with the reacquisition of Mark Hughes as well as the signing of high-profile players, including Brian McClair, Gary Pallister, Paul Ince, Neil Webb and Danny Wallace. However, an 11th-place finish in 1988–89 tested the patience of the club's supporters and as 1989 drew to a close, United's form was so bad (they occupied 15th place in the league on Christmas Day) that there were continued calls from the fans for Alex Ferguson to be sacked. Fans also demanded Edwards' resignation. However, Edwards stood by the manager and insisted that the issue of Ferguson being sacked was never up for debate. While Edwards admitted that he was disappointed with the lack of progress in the league, he understood the reasons for the disappointment, which was largely down to a series of injuries to key players, and said that he was pleased with Ferguson for his reorganisation of the squad.\n\nThe decision by Edwards to remain loyal to Ferguson paid off in 1989–90 as United lifted the FA Cup to end their five-year wait for a major trophy. A year later, United won the European Cup Winners' Cup. 1992 saw United win their first-ever Football League Cup, and a year later they ended their 26-year wait for the league title when crowned champions of the inaugural Premier League. The double followed a year later. 1994–95 was a relative disappointment for Edwards and indeed everyone else connected to United as they were pipped to both the league title and the FA Cup and left without a trophy, but United bounced back the following year to win a unique second double. By this stage, Edwards had been able to raise the funds for United to break the national transfer record on two occasions in the space of 18 months – the £3.75 million move for Roy Keane in the 1993 close season, and the £6 million move for Andy Cole in January 1995. The success continued for the rest of the decade with another league title in 1997 and a unique league title/FA Cup/European Cup treble in 1999. By the end of the decade, Edwards had made available the cash for United to buy the first two eight-figure signings of their history – defender Jaap Stam and striker Dwight Yorke.\n\nIn the 1998–99 he had accepted a £623 million bid from BSkyB to take over Manchester United, but the takeover was cancelled after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission blocked it. The Irish duo J.P. McManus and John Magnier also built a significant stake in the club. However, the club continued to have unprecedented success on the football pitch despite an uneasy relationship between manager Alex Ferguson and Martin Edwards. The success continued into the 21st century, as United retained the Premier League title in 2000 with a record 18-point margin and gained their third successive title the following year.\n\nEdwards enabled United to break the national transfer record twice in 2001 when they signed Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and Argentine midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron, but he was forced to resign as Chairman in November 2002, after allegations of using a prostitute on an official club business trip to Switzerland. Despite this, he continued to represent the club at FA and UEFA meetings.\n\nHe sold his 6.7% share in the club to new investor Harry Dobson in 2003. Edwards was also part of the 'Big 5', who drove the formation of the Premier League and pulled away from the football league.\n\nEdwards married Sue Jones in Bucklow, Cheshire in 1968.\n\nHe has been subject to several newspaper allegations about his private life, alleging several affairs. It was also alleged that he used prostitutes while on club business, in Britain, Brazil and most recently in Switzerland.\n\nEdwards received a police caution following an incident at the Mottram Hall Hotel, near Macclesfield, Cheshire on 17 August 2002. A woman in her 40s alleged that he had entered the ladies toilets and spied under one of the cubicles at her.\n\nHe resigned from the Manchester United board soon after news of the caution broke, and stepped down as chairman seven months later. After the incident, further witnesses came forward stating that they, too, had been victims of similar behaviour in toilets at Old Trafford.\n\nIn July 2005, Edwards was convicted of careless driving, having been involved in a head-on collision near Conwy, North Wales that April. He had just left the A55 near Conwy golf club, and took a right-hand bend on the wrong side of the road. In a letter to the court, Edwards explained how he had assumed he was on a one-way road after leaving the expressway. The driver of the other car, a Vauxhall Corsa, was badly hurt in the crash, after his car had collided with Edwards' Mercedes-Benz.

Premiering in September 1979 as the successor to the W116 line, the W126 was the second generation to officially bear that prestigious designation, an abbreviation for the German \"Sonderklasse\" or \"special class.\" It introduced many Mercedes-Benz safety innovations, including the first seatbelt pretensioners.\n\nA 2-door C126 coupé model, designated as \"SEC\", was introduced in September 1981, ending the 9-year gap with W108/W109 coupé/cabriolet last produced in 1972. This coupé reverted to basing on S-Class sedan with standard wheelbase rather than stretched R107 model. No cabriolet version was offered for C126. Only V8 engines were fitted to C126 model during its entire model run.\n\nThe W126's twelve-year production run between 1979 and 1991 was the longest of any S-Class generation since that designation began to be used by the company in the 1970s, an homage to the first \"S\" designated top-class models, the mid-1950s 300 S and 300 Sc.\n\nFollowing the debut of the 1970s generation W116 (which also included the limited-production Mercedes-Benz 450 SEL 6.9), Mercedes-Benz began plans for the next-generation S-Class model in October 1973. Codenamed \"project W126,\" the project had specific goals: an improved ride, better handling, and improved fuel efficiency. These improvements were aimed at helping retain the S-Class' market leadership as the world's best-selling prestige luxury sedan. Mercedes-Benz had made fuel efficiency an especially pertinent goal (named \"Energy Program\"), even in the large V8 engined versions of the S-Class.\n\nIn terms of the body design, the objective of the W126 design team, led by Mercedes-Benz's Bruno Sacco, was to produce a car that was sleeker and more aerodynamic than the previous model. The application of lighter materials and alloys combined with thorough wind tunnel testing to reduce overall drag meant the car consumed about 10% less fuel than its predecessor.\n\nAfter six years of development, the W126 was formally introduced at the Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung (International Motor Show, or IAA) in Frankfurt on September 1979. The initial lineup featured seven models in standard (S S-KLasse-Vergaser, SE S-Klasse-Einspritzmotor, SD S-Klasse-Diesel) and long (SEL, SDL) wheelbase sedan body styles: the 280 S/SE/SEL, 380 SE/SEL, 500 SE/SEL and 300 SD. Technically, the long-wheelbase (SEL) variants were codenamed V126, but this was not popularly known. In 1981, the coupé version C126 (SEC, acronym for (German) S-Klasse-Einspritzmotor-Coupé) of the W126 S-Class premiered at the IAA with the 500 SEC model. In 1981, \"Wheels Magazine\" selected the W126 model 380 SE as its Car of the Year.\n\nAlthough the top of range Mercedes-Benz 450 SEL 6.9 of the previous generation was not directly replaced, the W126 carried forward the hydropneumatic suspension of the 6.9 as an option on the 500 SEL and later on 420 SEL and 560 SEL models.\n\nFour years after the introduction of the fuel-efficiency \"Energieskonzept\" (Energy Concept) in 1981, the model range was extensively revised. In September 1985, again at the IAA in Frankfurt, the reworked model range was introduced. Apart from visual changes to the bumpers, side covers and larger 15-inch wheels with a new design on the hubcaps and alloys (optional), there where a number of technical upgrades as well as changes made to the available collection of engine variants was most visible. A new generation of inline-six petrol and diesel engines and new 4.2- and 5.5-litre V8s were added, and other engines were further upgraded.\n\nThe W126 generation was replaced by the W140 in 1991, although a satellite factory in South Africa is known to have continued production in a very limited number until 1994. The W126 S-Class achieved a sales total of 892,123 units (818,063 sedans and 74,060 coupés), making the W126 the most popular S-Class ever produced.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1975, Mercedes-Benz designers worked on the successor to the W116. In December 1975, after several design concepts being presented, the design for the W126 S-Class was approved and frozen in 1976. Design work on the coupe began immediately afterward, being finalized in 1977. It signaled a new era for Mercedes-Benz design; the aesthetics of which set the tone for the entire lineup in the subsequent decade. Indeed, in the automotive industry, the W126 had a significant influence on international car design theory and execution well into the 1990s.\n\nCompared to its predecessor, the W116, the W126 featured improved aerodynamics (with a drag coefficient of Cd 0.36 for the sedans, 0.34 for the coupés). For the first time, and to the consternation of some of the marque's traditionalists, the W126 was the first Mercedes not to come equipped with traditional chrome bumpers. In their place, polyurethane deformable bumpers were used, and visually aligned with body panels. Design patents were first filed on March 3, 1977 and later on September 6, 1977 at the United States Patent Office.\n\nIn 1985, Mercedes-Benz issued a facelift for the 126 series cars; revised bumpers, body side protection mouldings, and wheel designs differentiated the updated models. The 14\" so-called \"Bundt\" rims more or less standardized throughout the MB family since 1969 were replaced with the 15-slot flat-faced silver painted alloy rims that would carry the entire Mercedes-Benz line into the early 1990s.\n\nThe interior featured pleated leather on the doors and leather seats in the North American markets; while global markets were also offered Velour seats. Zebrano wood trim was used on all S-Class models during the first phase of the generation's run (1979-1985) with Burl Walnut featured in the flagship models in the second phase (1986-1991) the 560SEC and 560SEL.\n\nThe W126 series (named in accordance to their engine size) initially included the 280, 300, 380, and 500 series models. Following the first S-Class mid-cycle refresh, the W126 series included 260, 300, 350, 420, 500, and 560 models. Variants included SE (standard wheelbase), SEL (long-wheelbase), SEC (coupé), and diesel models (SD and SDL).\n\nNovel luxury features/options included the following safety, comfort, and technological features. While almost all of these features are available on modern luxury cars today, each in its own right was considered very significant in the 1980s. The harmonious and \"matter-of-fact\" way which these were combined, as well as their renowned durability, has added to the appeal of W126.\n\n\n\n\nFirst Series (1979-1985)\n\nAt the introduction in September 1979, the 2.8-litre DOHC six-cylinder inline M110 engine for 280 S, 280 SE, and 280 SEL was carried over from W116. The new generation of M116/M117 V8 engines had a significant innovation: aluminium block without iron sleeves as found in the competitors’ engines. Mercedes-Benz developed a special silicon coating as to harden the cylinder liners against excessive wear and tear. The V8 engines were offered in two sizes: 3.8 litres (M116) and 5.0 litres (M117). The smaller of two V8 engines was offered in the US market only, which turned out to be a disaster with timing chain issues and due to being severely underpowered. The S-Class coupés were fitted with V8 engines only for the first time.\n\nThe 3.0-litre five-cylinder inline OM617 diesel engine was carried over from W116 with same performance. Inexplicably, the diesel engines were again never offered in the markets outside United States and Canada. The lethargic acceleration, roughness, and lower top speed might not appeal to the European consumers who had higher expectations for the large saloons. This discrepancy wasn't addressed until 1994 when W140 S 350 TURBODIESEL was introduced in Europe for the first time.\n\nIn 1981, Mercedes-Benz introduced the “Energiekonzepts” (Energy Concept) programme in reducing the fuel consumption. This programme revised the combustion chambers and piston heads with lower compression ratio in the V8 engines. This revision caused further drop in engine performance.\n\nSecond Series (1986-1991)\n\nFor the second series introduced in September 1985, the engine range was extensively revised with new six-cylinder inline engines and enlarged V8 engines. Only 5.0-litre M117 V8 was carried over from the first series, expanding the V8 engine range to three.\n\nThe revised engine range focused more on reducing pollution and fuel consumption even further. For the first time, the customers outside US and Canadian markets could choose the models with or without catalysators. The models without catalysators can be retrofitted with catalysators at later date if the customers choose to: this retrofit method is called RÜF (Rückrüstfahrzeug — loosely translated as retrofit vehicle). The RÜF models had a mechanical switch in the engine bay to be operated by owners for running on lead or lead-free fuels, a necessary feature for driving outside Germany or in areas within Germany where the lead-free fuel wasn't widespread yet. In 1990, all engines were fitted with catalysators only.\n\nThe new six-cylinder inline M103 engine had a single overhead camshaft and electronic-mechanical fuel injection and was available in two sizes: 2.6 and 3.0 litres. The carburetted engine fitted to 280 S was eliminated, marking the end of carburetted engines for S-Class, and replaced with fuel-injected engines for 260 and 300.\n\nThe V8 engines were again bored out to 4.2 litres from 3.8 litres for 420 (M116) and 5.5 litres from 5.0 litres for 560 (M117) while 5.0-litre V8 for 500 (M117) was carried over. The V8 engines were fitted with new electronic ignition system and Bosch KE-Jetronic electronic-mechanical fuel injection system, first appeared in W201 190E. The revised V8 engines except 5.0-litre version had slight performance increase.\n\nThe most powerful engine ever fitted to W126 S-Class was 5.5-litre V8, putting out 221 kW (300 PS, 296 bhp). This engine, classified as ECE-Variante (German name), has higher compression ratio of 10:5 and cannot be retrofitted with catalysator at later date. In September 1986, the ECE-Variante was superseded by RÜF-Variante, which retains the same horsepower figure without catalysator and lower figure if retrofitted with catalysator at later date. The 560 SEL with 221 kW engine was fastest large saloon, reaching 250 km/h (155 mph), until BMW 750i/750iL was introduced in 1987 with \"ungoverned\" top speed of 300 km/h (186 mph). Its performance was comparable to Porsche 911 Carrera 3.2 or Ferrari Mondial. In 1990, 560 SEL had a reduced horsepower figure to \n\nFor the US and Canadian markets, a new 3.0-litre six-cylinder inline OM603 diesel engine was introduced, replacing five-cylinder engine with same displacement. It was a first six-cylinder passenger diesel engine by Mercedes-Benz. This new engine was available in long wheelbase version only, 300 SDL, for the first time. For California, the diesel engines were fitted with diesel particulate filter, a world's first for the passenger car. The new engine had an ill-gotten reputation for higher percentage of aluminium cylinder head failure due to poor placement of diesel particulate filter and due to the erosion of head gasket, allowing cooling fluid to seep in the cylinders. However, they failed to perform as designed and were removed from the engines. For 1988, the engine was revised to correct the issues and move the particulate filter further away from the engine. In 1990, the same engine was bored out to 3.5 litres as to compensate for reduced performance due to stricter emission regulations. The bored out 3.5-litre version did not have any of aforementioned issues other than some units experiencing the unexplained erosion of head gasket. The 3.5-litre version was available in both standard and long wheelbases (350 SD and 350 SDL).\n\nFirst Series (1979–1985)\n\nThe automatic transmission had four speeds with direct drive in the fourth gear for the entire run from 1979 to 1991. The 280 S, 280 SE, and 280 SEL had 4-speed manual transmission as standard with 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic transmissions as extra-cost options.\n\nThe manual transmission was not fitted to the V8 engines during the first series. The 300 SD TURBODIESEL had automatic transmission as sole transmission choice.\n\nSecond Series (1985-1991)\n\nFrom 1986 onward, the automatic transmission was revised to include the option of selecting S (Standard) and E (Economy) shifting points. The models, 260 SE, 300 SE, and 300 SEL were fitted with standard 5-speed manual and optional extra-cost 4-speed automatic transmissions. For one year from September 1986 to June 1987, extra cost automatic transmission option wasn't offered for 260 SE and 300SE. The customers ordering 420 SE could choose either 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission.\n\nFirst Series, 1979-1985\n\n<div class=\"NavContent\" style=\"margin:0;\">\nSecond Series, 1986-1991\n\n<div class=\"NavContent\" style=\"margin:0;\">\n\n\nWhen introducing a new W126 model range in the United States in the autumn 1980, Mercedes-Benz chose a smaller 3.8-litre version as the sole V8 offering in the United States for two reasons. Americans were still feeling the effect of second oil crisis in 1979, and the US government imposed the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) in 1975. Using less thirsty V8, Mercedes-Benz could avoid the penalty for not meeting CAFE.\n\nHowever, the economy rebounded and expanded greatly during the Reagan administration. The consumers perceived the smaller V8 as grossly underpowered by American standards. Thus, driving up the demand for more powerful 500 SE/SEL/SEC models in the grey import market. About 22,000 Mercedes-Benz vehicles, including 500 SE/SEL/SEC, were imported from Europe per year until 1987 when the loophole for personal import was closed and regulations for grey import tightened.\n\nTwo AMG-modified 500 SEC cars raced at the 1989 24 Hours of Spa. Both cars failed to finish, with one suffering gearbox issues, while the other had issues with the rear axle.\n\nThe W126 S-Class achieved several awards during its production period. The W126 model 300 SD was the Motor Trend Import Car of the Year in 1981. The W126 model 380 SE was the \"Wheels Magazine\" Car of the Year in 1981, the W126 was awarded the U.S. Highway Loss Data Institute \"Safest Passenger Car of the Year\" in 1988 and 1989, and the W126 was the third-ranked luxury vehicle in J.D. Power's 1990 Initial Quality Survey (IQS). In 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1990, with the W126 S-Class leading its sales, Mercedes-Benz received the highest customer ratings in the J.D. Power Sales Satisfaction Index.\n\nThe W126 series of S-Class has been the most popular S-Class on record in terms of units produced. The W126's 12-year production run was longer than any S-Class before or since. Due to its \"bank vault\" built and status symbol, W126 has been popular with celebrities, business leaders, heads of state, dictators, and such. Three armoured 560 SEL ordered by Saddam Hussein had a series of pipes shooting the flames out of sides.\n\nA limited number of W126 continued to be produced in South Africa until 1994, three years after the introduction of W140 S-Class. No figures were given for South African production. Nelson Mandela was given a special commemorative model, a red 500 SE. His 500 SE was the last W126 assembled in South Africa and with components donated by Mercedes-Benz South Africa.\n\n\n"}

In 2003, he attracted media attention by gatecrashing Prince William's 21st birthday party.\n\nAaron Barschak was born in 1966 into a Jewish family. His father, Fred Barschak, fled Vienna in 1938, the rest of his father's family died during the Nazi Holocaust. Aaron grew up in Hampstead in North London and attended City of London School where he learnt French and Spanish. After leaving school, Barschak travelled to Bolivia working at importing Western pop records and later moved to New York to study acting.\n\nHe came to public attention on 21 June 2003, when he gatecrashed Prince William's 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle whilst wearing a pink dress, a false beard and a turban in a fashion similar to Osama bin Laden. After flashing his merkin at the crowds outside, he scaled the walls of the castle and entered William's party. He was arrested after storming the stage where William was giving a speech. He was not prosecuted.\n\nThe intrusion triggered a police investigation into the security breach.\n\nBarschak has also appeared for a three-week run at the Underbelly venue at the 2003 Edinburgh Fringe with a show, \"Osama Likes It Hot\", co-written with Brendhan Lovegrove, to a generally poor critical reception. In the early days of the run, it was apparent that Barschak was woefully unprepared for the show and the critics were unsurprisingly harsh. The show received stronger reviews later in the run. The poor critical reception did not prevent early high sales due to his fame from the Windsor Castle incident.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, by-elections gain major national media coverage. They fall in between elections and can be seen as a straw poll of public opinion. Barschak stood in the Brent East by-election of 2003 coming 14th of the 16 candidates and gaining 37 votes. He stood again in Witney in the 2010 General Election, against the leader of the Conservative Party, coming last out of 10 candidates with 53 votes, appearing at the count dressed in a long white robe with a crown of thorns and carrying a sign saying \"Close Campsfield House\".\n\nA 2004 documentary film, \"Rebel Without Applause\", made by his sister Tamara, charts his life during the previous three years.\n\nBarschak is also famous for throwing a bucket of red paint over Young British Artist Jake Chapman, apparently in protest (albeit in a suitably parodic form) over the latter's vandalism (along with his brother, Dinos Chapman) of a series of original prints of Goya's \"The Disasters of War\". Barschak was jailed for a month.\n\nIn 2005, he was arrested and bailed following an incident in Wapping.\n\nIn 2006, Barschak stormed a controversial art sale of a painting believed to be created by Adolf Hitler whom Barschak dressed up as.\n\nHis brief comedy career has not been a success and he appears to have returned to obscurity, reflected by his occasional appearances on the James Whale Show on TalkSport radio, although he has recently performed at the launch party for The Event - a high-profile series of artist run activities in permanent and temporary spaces throughout central Birmingham.\n\n"}

Its ruins are at Housesteads in the civil parish of Bardon Mill in Northumberland, England, south of Broomlee Lough. The fort was built in stone around AD 124, soon after the construction of the wall began in AD 122 when the area was part of the Roman province of Britannia. Its name has been variously given as Vercovicium, Borcovicus, Borcovicium, and Velurtion. The name of the 18th-century farmhouse of Housesteads gives the modern name. The site is owned by the National Trust and is in the care of English Heritage. Finds can be seen in the site museum, in the museum at Chesters, and in the in Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nHadrian's Wall was begun in AD 122. A fort was built in stone at the Housesteads Roman Fort site around AD 124 overlying the original Broad Wall foundation and Turret 36B. The fort was repaired and rebuilt several times, its northern defences being particularly prone to collapse. A substantial civil settlement (vicus) existed to the south, outside the fort, and some of the stone foundations can still be seen, including the so-called \"Murder House\", where two skeletons were found beneath an apparently newly-laid floor when excavated.\n\nIn the 2nd century AD, the garrison consisted of an unknown double-sized auxiliary infantry cohort and a detachment of legionaries from \"Legio II Augusta\". In the 3rd century, it comprised \"Cohors I Tungrorum\", augmented by the \"numerus Hnaudifridi\" and the \"Cuneus Frisiorum\", a Frisian cavalry unit, \"cuneus\" referring to a wedge formation. The Tungrians were still there in the 4th century, according to the \"Notitia Dignitatum\". By 409 AD the Romans had withdrawn.\n\nMost other early forts straddle the Wall and therefore protrude into barbarian territory. It is also unusual for Britain in that it has no running water supply and is dependent upon rainwater collection (for which purpose there is a series of large stone-lined tanks around the periphery of the defences). It also has one of the best-preserved stone latrines in Roman Britain.\n\nThe name of the fort has been given as Borcovicus, Borcovicium, and Velurtion. An inscription found at Housesteads with the letters VER, is believed to be short for Ver(covicianorum) – the letters ver being interchangeable with bor in later Latin. The name of the 18th-century farmhouse of Housesteads provides the modern name.\n\nThe site is now owned by the National Trust and is currently in the care of English Heritage. Finds from Vercovicium can be seen in the site museum, in the museum at Chesters, and in the in Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nHousesteads is a former farm whose lands include the ruins of the fort. In 1604 Hugh Nixon, \"Stealer of cattle and receiver of stolen goods\", became the tenant of Housesteads farm. From 1663, Housesteads was the home of the Armstrongs, a notorious family of Border Reivers. Nicholas Armstrong bought the farm in 1692, only to have to sell it again in 1694 to Thomas Gibson of Hexham for the sum of £485. They remained as tenants. They were a well-known band of horse thieves and cattle rustlers who used the old fort as a place to hold the stolen horses and cattle. They traded as far afield as Aberdeen and the south of England. At one time every male member of the family was said to have been a 'broken man', formally outlawed by English or Scottish authorities. Nicholas was hanged in 1704, and his brothers fled to America. The Armstrongs lived in a typical 16th-century defensive bastle house of two storeys: the ground floor for livestock and the upper level for living quarters. Its ruins remain built up against the south gate of the Roman fort, with external stone steps and narrow loop windows. A corn-drying kiln was inserted into the gate's guard chamber in the 17th century.\n\nIn 1698, the farm had been sold to Thomas Gibson who turned the land around the fort to agriculture and thus ploughed up numerous Roman artefacts. The 17th-century bastle house was replaced by a farmhouse located over the Roman hospital, which was sketched by William Stukeley in 1725. Throughout the 18th century Housesteads was farmed by a single tenant farming family. Since Hodgson recorded the presence of William Magnay as the tenant during that period this fixes the tenure. In particular, the well (thought to be Roman) was documented as having actually been built by William, and used by the family as a bath. Interest in the fort increased in the 19th century, particularly after the farm was purchased by the amateur historian John Clayton in 1838, to add to his collection of Roman Wall farms. The Roman site was cleared of later buildings by Clayton, and the present farmhouse built about 1860. John Maurice Clayton attempted to auction the fort in 1929. It did not reach its reserve and was donated to the National Trust in 1930. The farm was later owned by the Trevelyans who gave the land for the site museum.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Formerly a regiment, the unit became 'A' (London Scottish) Company of the London Regiment.\n\nThe regiment was founded on the formation of the Volunteer Force in 1859. Originally as part of the Volunteer Force sponsored by The Highland Society of London and The Caledonian Society of London, a group of individual Scots raised The London Scottish Rifle Volunteers under the command of Lt Col Lord Elcho, later The Earl of Wemyss and March. The regiment became the 7th (London Scottish) Middlesex Volunteer Rifle Corps and then, in 1908, the 14th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (London Scottish).\n\nThe 1/14th Battalion was mobilized on the outbreak of war, departing for France on 15 September 1914. On 31 October 1914 the battalion encountered German forces at Messines in Belgium. The 2/14th Battalion embarked for France in June 1916 but was then transferred to Salonika and Palestine.\n\nIn 1937, on the break-up of the London Regiment, the unit was re-named The London Scottish, The Gordon Highlanders.\n\nThe London Scottish raised three battalions during the Second World War, two of which served overseas. Both of the overseas battalions served with the Middle Eastern Forces in Sicily and Italy. The battalions were:\n\nThe peacetime battalion of the regiment, served as infantry within the 168th (London) Infantry Brigade (alongside the 1st London Irish Rifles and 10th Royal Berkshire Regiment), part of the 56th (London) Infantry Division (nicknamed \"The Black Cats\"), playing a significant part in the Italian Campaign, fighting in the Allied invasion of Sicily, fighting at Monte Camino, Battle of Anzio, Gothic Line (afterwards transferred to 167th (London) Infantry Brigade) and Operation Grapeshot, the final offensive in Italy in 1945.\n\nRaised as a 'duplicate' of the 1st Battalion, with a core of officers and senior NCOs from that battalion. The battalion initially served in the 141st (London) Infantry Brigade, 47th (London) Infantry Division.\n\nWhen the duplicate battalion was formed in April 1939, the regiment had enough recruits to form a third battalion; permission was granted provided it was formed as an anti-aircraft (AA) regiment of the Royal Artillery. It was designated 97th (The London Scottish) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA and formed with HQ and two batteries (298 and 299) at Westminster. It served in 1st AA Division (the old 47th (2nd London) Division) defending London during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz. In March 1943 it left for North Africa where it joined British Eighth Army, and served with it in the Allied invasion of Sicily and Italian Campaign. With the depletion of the \"Luftwaffe\" and the reduced requirement for AA defences, it was converted in November 1944 into 97th (London Scottish) Garrison Regiment, RA, later designated 610 Infantry Regiment, RA. When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, 610 Regiment was reformed as 497th (London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA at Hammersmith, later renamed 497th (Hammersmith) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, without any London Scottish connection.\nIn 1967 the London Scottish tradition was resurrected on the formation of G (London Scottish) Company 1st Battalion 51st Highland Volunteers. Since 1992, the tradition has been carried on by A (London Scottish) Company of the London Regiment, which provides Reserve support to the Foot Guards.\n\nThe London Scottish Cadet Corps, which was formed around 1902, had three companies, a pipe band and its own colours and was sponsored by the regiment. The corps evolved to become 235 Westminster Detachment (London Scottish Regiment), part of 23 Company Middlesex and North West London Army Cadet Force: it is based at the Rochester Row Army Reserve Centre in Westminster and is the sole surviving cadet unit maintaining the traditions of the regiment.\n\nFrom its establishment in 1859 The London Scottish wore Hodden Grey uniforms with dark blue facings. This unique colour remained as full dress for the entire regiment until 1914 and survives in the modern kilts and mess dress.\n\nBeing founded right after the regiment was raised, the Regimental Pipes and Drums of The London Scottish is one of the oldest army pipe bands in the world. It wears its distinctive Hodden Grey tartan maintaining the traditions of the original London Scottish. The pipes and drums accompany the entire regiment during official dinners, military parades, presentation of colours and other regimental functions, effectively providing musical support. It has performed at many high profile events in the City of London as well as Greater London, most notably the Beating Retreat, Lord Mayor's Show and The Royal Caledonian Ball. Outside of the United Kingdom, the band has had the opportunity to perform at many parades and military tattoos in countries such as Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Uzbekistan and Jamaica.\n\nFrom 1953 to 2002, the Pipe Major of the London Scottish held the position of Piper to the Queen Mother.\n\n\nThree members of the regiment were awarded the Victoria Cross:\n\n\n\n"}

Modern football has been one of the most well supported sports in China, since it was introduced in the early 20th century. The country was recognised by former FIFA president Joseph \"Sepp\" Blatter as the first to invent football, 5000 years ago through Tsu' Chu, an ancient Chinese ball game (although there are differences between Tsu' Chu or Cuju and modern football). English sources claim that football was officially formalised in England in 1863, originating from a simple game that had been played for many centuries between villages in England. .\n\nThe national governing body is the Chinese Football Association (CFA). Hong Kong and Macau have separate national teams and leagues. Association football is the most popular spectator sport in China, followed by basketball.\n\nAccording to FIFA ranking on 10 August 2017, the Men's National Team is ranked 77th in the world, and according to FIFA women's world rankings on 23 June 2017, the Women's National Team is ranked 14th.\n\nThe Chinese Football Association Super League (), commonly known as Chinese Super League (, CSL), currently known as the Wanda Plaza Chinese Super League, is the highest tier of professional association football in China, operating under the auspices of the Chinese Football Association (CFA).\n\nThe Super League was created by the re-branding of the former top division, Chinese Football Association Jia-A League, in 2004. While the league originally consisted of 12 teams, 16 teams now compete in it. The title has been won by seven teams:Shanghai Shenhua, Shenzhen Jianlibao, Dalian Shide, Shandong Luneng, Changchun Yatai and Beijing Guoan. The current Super League champions are Guangzhou Evergrande and in 2015 the average attendance has been of 22,193 spectators.\n\nThe China PR national football team is governed by the Chinese Football Association (CFA). The team was founded in 1924 in the Republic of China under the auspices of the China Football Association and joined FIFA in 1931. Following the Chinese Civil War, the CFA was formed in the newly founded People's Republic of China. They remained affiliated with FIFA until 1958, when they withdrew, but they rejoined in 1979.\n\nChina have been runners-up at the Asian Cup twice: in 1984 and 2004.\n\nFootball initiatives have been developed, including Vision China - a part FIFA Vision Asia - which has reached the highest standard in Asia and the quarter final of the men's competition in the 2008 Olympics. The programmed covers marketing, development, footballer training, coach and referee training, sports medicine, competitions, media, and fans. It also includes assessments on Chinese football, planning matches and monitoring them. Goal Project for China, part of FIFA Goal Project invested in China to help build the new headquarters of the CFA.\n\nAn early form of football was developed in China in the Han dynasty, during the second and third centuries BCE, called Tsu' Chu. This is in fact the earliest form of football worldwide for which there is documentary evidence, in the form of a military manual. This was played using a leather ball filled with feathers and hair and a small net held by long bamboo canes. This game died out well before modern football was adopted in China.\n\nThe Chinese government has outlined plans to make the Asian nation a footballing superpower and to create 50,000 special football schools in a decade.\n\nFootball is covered by the Chinese media. National competitions are generally televised on CCTV-5 and CCTV-5+. Guangdong Television reserves rights, however, for the Premier League and the UEFA Champions League. Since 1996, CCTV-5 has weekly programmes televising live games in the Italian Serie A and German Bundesliga to \"Football Night\" (足球之夜). Serie A, Bundesliga and La Liga are broadcast on CCTV-5. Shanghai's Dongfang Sports channel also has regular football coverage.\n\nChinese football fans often associate themselves most with teams in the English Premier League, the Italian Serie A and the German Bundesliga. Chinese players going to play in European leagues attracts massive media attention. The pioneers were Xie Yuxin who joined FC Zwolle (Netherlands), Gu Guangming who joined SV Darmstadt 98 (Germany), and Jia Xiuquan and Liu Haiguang both joined FK Partizan (Yugoslavia), all in 1987. Prominent more recent examples include Sun Jihai, formerly of Manchester City; Zheng Zhi, who played for Celtic; Shao Jiayi, formerly of 1860 Munich, now of MSV Duisburg; Yang Chen, formerly of Eintracht Frankfurt; and Wu Lei, of RCD Espanyol.\nThe professional league is marred by match-fixing, illegal betting, and violence on and off the pitch, which the Chinese government has promised to fix. Two former top executives of the Football Association of China were arrested and prosecuted for taking bribes.\n\n\n"}

The ship was launched on 8 May 1919; sponsored by Miss Alma Freeman Welles, the granddaughter of Gideon Welles. \"Welles\" was commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 2 September 1919, Lieutenant Commander George N. Reeves, Jr., in command.\n\nAfter her final sea trials off the east coast, \"Welles\" joined Squadron 2, Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet, based at San Diego, California. She operated out of San Diego, \"showing the flag\" and training, until she was decommissioned there on 15 June 1922. Meanwhile, the destroyer was classified as DD-257 during the fleet-wide assignment of alphanumeric hull numbers on 17 July 1920.\n\n\"Welles\" remained at San Diego into the 1930s, as crises multiplied in Europe and the Far East. On 1 September 1939, German forces invaded Poland, triggering World War II. In response to the European conflict, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed the neutrality of the United States and instructed the Navy to establish a Neutrality Patrol off the eastern seaboard, out of Guantanamo Bay, and at the eastward approaches of the Panama Canal.\n\nTo carry out the patrol, the Navy recommissioned 77 destroyers and light minelayers to augment fleet units already at sea that had assumed their patrol stations in September 1939, soon after the outbreak of fighting in Poland. \"Welles\" was recommissioned at San Diego on 6 November 1939, Lt. Cmdr. Clifton G. Grimes in command. She was fitted out at San Diego and then moved to the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, to undergo alterations and a drydocking that started a few days before Christmas and extended into the new year, 1940.\n\nFollowing the yard work, \"Welles\" arrived back at San Diego in company with the destroyer and later departed the area on 5 February, bound for Panama. She transited the Panama Canal on the 16th and stopped at the Submarine Base at Coco Solo on the following day. There, she embarked six enlisted men for transportation to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and arrived there on 25 February.\n\nAfter patrolling the approaches to Guantanamo Bay for nearly two weeks, \"Welles\" - transporting 10 enlisted men - sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, with the remainder of her division (Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 67): , , and division flagship on 14 March. Mooring at the navy yard and discharging her passengers on the 17th, the destroyer proceeded to sea on 6 April, bound for the Caribbean.\n\nArriving at San Juan, Puerto Rico, four days later, \"Welles\" departed the same evening. She joined the cruiser on the following morning, and the two ships sailed in company on Neutrality Patrol and conducted exercises until 17 April, when the destroyer returned to San Juan.\n\n\"Welles\" patrolled the waters near San Juan from 19 to 23 April before taking part in a battle problem and undergoing her annual military inspection on the 26th. The warship subsequently visited Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, on 1 May. She remained there for two weeks before returning to San Juan.\n\nProceeding to sea again on 8 June, \"Welles\" conducted exercises en route to Cuban waters and subsequently operated out of Guantanamo Bay over the next few days. During this time, the ship conducted a short-range battle practice. Shifting to Cay Lobos, Great Bahamas, on 20 June, \"Welles\" then transported 56 men and one officer from the destroyer to Guantanamo, debarking the men to . \"Welles\" then remained at Guantanamo until she sailed for the Canal Zone on 27 July. Anchoring in Limon Bay, Canal Zone, on the 28th, \"Welles\" later transited the Panama Canal on 10 August, dropping anchor in Panama Bay on 12 August. She performed target services and conducted exercises and maneuvers with Submarine Division 11 until 16 August, when the destroyer retransmitted the canal, east-bound, and arrived at Coco Solo that day.\n\n\"Welles\" sailed for Norfolk on 22 August with the rest of DesDiv 67, proceeded via Guantanamo Bay, and arrived six days later. At that time, \"Welles\" and 49 of her sister ships were slated to be transferred to the British government as a result of an agreement reached between President Roosevelt and the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.\n\n\"Welles\" loaded service ammunition at Norfolk before she sailed for Newport, Rhode Island, where she then exchanged older torpedoes for ones of a later mark on 1 September. \"Welles\" soon shifted to the Boston Navy Yard, where she was drydocked, before she sailed—in company with and \"Herndon\" on 5 September for Halifax, Nova Scotia, the designated turnover point. Arriving the next day as one of the first eight ships to be transferred, \"Welles\" soon took on board the prospective crew (six British officers and 120 enlisted men) for familiarization. Three days later, on 9 September 1940, \"Welles\" was decommissioned and turned over to the Royal Navy. Her American name was struck from the United States Navy list on 8 January 1941.\n\nSimultaneously, the destroyer was renamed HMS \"Cameron\" (I05) and placed under the command of Lt. Cmdr. P. G. Merriman, Royal Navy. Initially, the warship suffered problems with a faulty generator which delayed her sailing for the British Isles. After finally getting underway for England, the destroyer made port at Plymouth on 13 November, after a stop-over at Belfast, Northern Ireland. \"Cameron\" shifted to Portsmouth three days later, and was slated to receive her first major overhaul since coming under the White Ensign. However, she was never to finish this as, on 5 December 1940, Luftwaffe bombers struck Portsmouth while \"Cameron\" lay defenseless in drydock no. 8. A high explosive bomb severely damaged the ship, capsizing her.\n\nJudged unsuitable for return to active sea service, \"Cameron\" was eventually refloated on 23 February 1941 and allocated for use as a hulk. United States Navy experts consequently subjected the ship to close scrutiny to derive damage control measures which could be applicable to ships of her type still in service with the Navy. As such, she presented them with what John Alden, in his book, \"Flush Decks and Four Pipes\", termed the most extreme case of hull damage seen by Americans until and were blasted by Japanese bombs at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.\n\nAdmiralty records indicate that \"Cameron\" fulfilled a useful purpose. The Admiralty Committee on Shock in Ships conducted shock tests on the hulk between July 1942 and September 1943. Paid off on 5 October 1943, \"Cameron\" remained in dockyard hands at Portsmouth until towed to Falmouth in November 1944, where she was subsequently broken up for scrap.\n\n\n"}

It is a 1,160-bed tertiary hospital serving more than 670,000 outpatients and 49,000 inpatients.\n\nNUH is a member of the National University Health System and is the principal teaching hospital for the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. It is located in Kent Ridge, sharing its grounds with three national specialty centres, namely the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS), the National University Heart Centre, Singapore (NUHCS) and the National University Centre for Oral Health, Singapore (NUCOHS).\n\nNUH was originally known as the Kent Ridge Hospital according to its proposal as early as 1972, with a second plan drawn in 1975 by the then-University of Singapore Development Unit, when the hospital was planned at the Kent Ridge area, which actually costs $193 million to build, with an initial projection of 752 beds and a cost of $143 million. Construction began in 1980 and the entire project was completed at the end of 1984. NUH was the first privately run, government-owned hospital under the owner and managed by Temasek Holdings.\n\nNUH received its new staff on 15 January 1985 (on the same day itself, Kent Ridge Hospital was renamed to NUH) and opened to the public and received its first patients on 24 June 1985, with the opening of two departments namely the Department of Medicine and the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. The hospital was officially opened on 17 June 1986 by Goh Chok Tong, then First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence. Prior to its opening, clinical training for the students of NUS were carried out at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH), where the university's medical school was located until it moved to the new NUS campus at Kent Ridge in 1986.\n\nThe hospital was originally owned by Temasek Holdings, a government investment holding company. It came under the Ministry of Health's Health Corporation of Singapore (HCS) in 1987. In 1990 the government decided to hand over the governance of the hospital to the National University of Singapore (NUS). This was in tune with the government's idea of making NUH the principal medical teaching institution of Singapore. In order to avoid duplication of services, the government decided to make highly specialised units available at only two places, SGH and NUH. All other hospitals were to house general specialty departments only. Since NUH was too large a financial operation to be transferred entirely in one go, the hospital first reverted to Temasek Holdings before being transferred to NUS in phases. The hospital added in a 200-bed, seven-storey tower ward block, eight operating theatres, and intensive care units over an area of 3.2 ha at a cost of S$100 million.\n\nNUH was conferred the Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation in August 2004 and the Singapore Service Class award in July 2004. It also received a triple ISO certification:\n\nIn August 2007, Minister for Health Khaw Boon Wan announced plans to build two new national centres at NUH for heart and cancer treatments, the top two medical killers. The National University Heart Centre, Singapore (NUHCS) announced its plans during a press conference on 2 December 2008 to improve its care and treatment for patients. This will be done by scoping patient care and the delivery of clinical services into four systematic, holistic, and phased programmes:\n\n\nIn January 2008, NUH and the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and Faculty of Dentistry came together to form the National University Health System. This will help meet the healthcare needs as it brings about synergy that will be achieved from the integration of education, and clinical care. Plans on the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) was announced in 2009. To meet the increase and anticipated upward trend in healthcare demand, the infrastructure on the Kent Ridge campus will be developed to include extensive research and education facilities to be housed in the NUHS flagship Centre for Translational Medicine building, and two national centres for Cancer and Cardiovascular medicine at the NUH site.\n\nIn April 2014, the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) moved into the NUH Medical Centre, providing one-stop holistic and comprehensive care, management and treatment for both adult and paediatric oncology patients. Covering over 13,000 square metres and occupying levels 8, 9 and 10, the NCIS is housed alongside other outpatient medical specialisations at the NUH Medical Centre and is a one-stop centre in the prevention, management and treatment of cancer.\n\nIn January 2013, the NCIS and JurongHealth signed a Memorandum of Understanding known as the Western Cancer Action Network - WCAN to develop a plan that will lead to the provision of cancer care for people living in the western half of Singapore.\n\nNUH was involved in the successful treatment of six year old Oscar Saxelby-Lee who had been suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia since December 2018 and which other treatments had failed to achieve the results they hoped for. He arrived in November 2019 and was discharged back to the UK in April 2020. His treatment had been crowdfunded.\n\nBuilt in 1985, NUH's main building and service block are situated in a north-south orientation and conveniently linked by a service and communications \"spine\". The designers separated the \"service tunnel\" from the pedestrian levels, taking advantage of the slope. The blocks respond to the tropical climate with recessed windows, verandahs, and concrete sun shades. Shady courtyards that act as reservoirs of cool air enhance cross-ventilation in the non-air-conditioned interiors.\n\nKent Ridge Wing 2 was completed in 1996. It comprises an inpatient wing and also houses specialist outpatient clinics and service centres.\n\nOperational since July 2013, the 19-storey NUH Medical Centre is the hospital's newest outpatient facility to serve primarily subsidised patients. Located directly above the Kent Ridge MRT station and designed with patients in mind, it brings about greater accessibility and convenience especially for elderly patients. Buildings are linked by bridges.\n\nThe National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) is a national specialty centre and the only public cancer centre in Singapore treating both paediatric and adult cancers in one facility. The NCIS offers a broad spectrum of cancer care and management that ranges from public education, screening and early diagnosis, to treatment, and long-term health maintenance. These span across blood cancers and blood disorders, breast, colorectal, gynaecological, head and neck, liver, pancreatic and biliary, thoracic, urologic, upper gastrointestinal, paediatric haematological malignancies, brain and musculoskeletal cancers. The NCIS houses multidisciplinary tumour groups including but not limited to the Division of Surgical Oncology, the Department of Haematology–Oncology and the Department of Radiation Oncology.\n\nThe National University Heart Centre, Singapore (NUHCS), provides treatment and management of complex cardiovascular diseases with focus areas on heart failure, congenital heart disease, acute coronary syndrome, and vascular disease.\n\nThe National University Centre for Oral Health, Singapore (NUCOHS) brings together NUH's University Dental Cluster (UDC) and NUS's Faculty of Dentistry (FOD) as a national specialty centre for specialist oral healthcare services.\n\nA Class A single bedded room in a general ward in 2016 costs S$420 a night, with deluxe rooms in the same ward S$550.

She was later elected as one of two \"top-up\" members of the 1996 Northern Ireland Peace Forum and in the 1998 Northern Ireland Assembly elections won a seat in North Down.\n\nIn June 2001 Bell was appointed Deputy Leader of the Alliance by Seán Neeson, following the resignation of Seamus Close over disagreements on the party's direction. However Neeson himself soon resigned and Bell stood for the leadership as a traditionalist bridge-building candidate, against David Ford who was on the more consciously Liberal, internationalist wing of the party. At the Party's council Bell received 45 votes to Ford's 86 and she remained as the party's deputy leader. In the 2003 Assembly elections she retained her seat.\n\nOn 10 December 2005 it was announced that Bell would stand down as Deputy Leader of the party and not contest the next Assembly elections.\n\nBell acted as the Speaker of the Assembly established by the Northern Ireland Act 2006 and of the Transitional Assembly established by the Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006. On 8 May 2006 she was appointed Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly (which had been suspended since 2002) only to be replaced that same day by William Hay.\n\nAfter leaving political life Eileen Bell turned to a charity she had long supported and became vice president and Legislative Advisor to Autism NI. She has been one of the driving forces behind a Lobby for an Autism Bill in Northern Ireland. She was also the Chairperson of Downtown Women's Group which managed the Women into Politics Project. She stayed on as a\nBoard member of the group until it wound down in 2015.\n\nShe was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours.\n"}

After attending night spots in Claremont, a wealthy western suburb of Perth, Western Australia, all three women disappeared in similar circumstances leading police to suspect that an unidentified serial killer was the offender. The case, described as the state's biggest, longest running, and most expensive investigation, remains unsolved. However, in 2016, a suspect, Bradley Robert Edwards, was arrested. His trial began in November 2019.\n\nThe case began with the disappearance of Sarah Spiers (18) on 27 January 1996, after she left Club Bayview in the centre of Claremont at around 2:00 am. At 2:06 am, Spiers called Swan Taxis from a public telephone booth. Although she was living in South Perth with her older sister at the time, she had requested to be taken to the nearby suburb of Mosman Park. She was then sighted waiting alone near the corner of Stirling Road and Stirling Highway by three eyewitnesses, who also mentioned seeing an unidentified car stopping where she was waiting However, she was not at the site when the responding taxi arrived at 2:09 and, in the dark, could have been missed by the driver. Her disappearance soon attracted massive publicity and her fate remains unknown.\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday 9 June 1996, Jane Rimmer (23) from Shenton Park, also disappeared from the same part of Claremont. Similar to Spiers, she had been out socialising with friends the night before. Rimmer's friends explained how they had moved from the Ocean Beach Hotel to the Continental Hotel and then Club Bayview. Noting the long line at the club, her friends then caught a taxi home, but Rimmer opted to stay, and she was last seen on security footage waiting outside the Continental at 12:04 am. Fifty-five days later, on Saturday, 3 August 1996, her naked body was found 40 km south in bush-land near Woolcoot Road, Wellard by a family picking wildflowers.\n\nNine months later, in the early hours of Saturday 15 March 1997, Ciara Glennon, a 27-year-old lawyer from Mosman Park, also disappeared from the Claremont area. Like the others, she was with friends at the Continental and had decided to make her own way home. Three men at a bus stop saw Glennon walking south along Stirling Highway at approximately 12:30 am, and observed her interacting with an unidentified light coloured vehicle which had stopped by her. Nineteen days later, on 3 April, her semi-clothed body was found by a bush walker, 40 km north, near a track in scrub off Pipidinny Road in Eglinton.\n\nWithin 48 hours of the disappearance of Spiers, the case was taken over by the Major Crimes Squad. After the disappearance of Rimmer, the WA Police set up a special task-force called Macro to investigate the two similar cases. After the disappearance of Glennon, police confirmed that they were searching for a serial killer, and the WA government offered a $250,000 reward, the largest ever offered in the state at that time.\n\nInitial suspicion centred on the unidentified vehicles seen at two of the locations, and on an unidentified man seen in the video footage. Suspicion then focused on Perth's taxi-drivers given that the women were last seen in circumstances where they may have used taxis. This included a taxi-driver who claimed to have transported Spiers the night before her disappearance. A massive fingerprint and DNA-testing exercise was then carried out on the thousands of taxi drivers licensed in Western Australia. Given evidence of a number of unlicenced operators, examining standards for eligibility were raised, and 78 drivers with significant criminal history were de-licensed. Stricter standards were also applied to verifying that decommissioned taxis were stripped of insignia and equipment. In December 2015, investigators finally revealed that fibres taken from Rimmer were identified as coming from a VS Series 1 Holden Commodore.\n\nMacro attracted both praise and criticism for their handling of the case. At its peak, it had over 100 members across 10 teams. To avoid leaks, strict confidentiality protocols were implemented, and details of the nature of the deaths and injuries were suppressed. One of the tactics used by Macro was the controversial distribution of questionnaires to 110 \"persons of interest\", including various confrontational enquiries such as \"Are you the killer?\" Another was its reliance on international experts and use of an imported lie detector machine. Further, one of its officers accepted an offer by David Birnie to assist the investigation. Criticism was also laid on its overly narrow focus on the initial prime suspect despite the lack of direct evidence (as occurred in the cases of Andrew Mallard and Lloyd Rayney). Over its lifetime, Macro was subject to 11 police reviews, including one in August 2004 led by Paul Schramm, the officer who led the Snowtown investigation. It was finally wound down in September 2005 and the investigation moved to the Special Crimes Squad.\n\nAs with similar cases, experts suggested that the suspect was probably a single white male, aged 25–35, who had a residence in the area, who appeared trustworthy, was organised, social, and probably well educated. Local sex workers were also questioned for signs of unusual behaviour in clients.\n\nIn April 1998, a public servant from Cottesloe, Lance Williams (41), was identified by police as the prime suspect, after his behaviour attracted their attention (e.g. driving around after midnight and circling the Claremont area up to 30 times) during a decoy operation. Subjected to a high level of surveillance and police pressure over several years, he continued to maintain his innocence. After interviewing him six times at length, police declared in late 2008 that he was \"no longer a person of interest\". He died in 2018.\n\nIt was reported that police also investigated whether Bradley Murdoch may have been involved, although Murdoch was serving a custodial sentence from November 1995 until February 1997. In October 2006, it was also announced that Mark Dixie was a prime suspect in the killings, and that Macro had requested DNA samples. However, WA Police Deputy Commissioner Murray Lampard was later quoted as saying: \"Dixie was closely investigated at the time and eventually ruled out as a suspect.\"\n\nOn 22 December 2016, Bradley Robert Edwards (48) was arrested at his Kewdale house in relation to the deaths of both Rimmer and Glennon. According to ABC News, he is believed to have had no previous link to the case. The next day, Edwards was charged with both murders. He has also been charged in relation to two other alleged attacks: a house break and enter and unlawful detention of an 18-year-old woman in Huntingdale on 15 February 1988, and the unlawful detention and two counts of aggravated sexual penetration without consent of a 17-year-old girl in Claremont on 12 February 1995, On 22 February 2018, Edwards was also charged with the wilful murder of the third victim, Spiers. In all, Edwards was charged with eight offences:\n\nThe trial began on 25 November. During the trial, the court was told that two of the victims had defensive wounds.\n\nOne of the main pieces of evidence in the trial will be Telstra work vehicles. Edwards was working as a technician at the time, and it will be claimed that he used company vehicles after hours to execute the crimes. This is corroborated by a witness who recalled seeing a Telstra van parked on multiple occasions at the Karrakatta Cemetery \"for no apparent reason\", both after that attack and before Spiers' disappearance. According to the prosecutor, Carmel Barbagallo, the state intends to present this evidence as part of a case called \"Telstra Living Witness project\", where between 1995 and 1997 a man with a Telstra station wagon stopped to look at women and offer them rides.\n\nDuring the trial, Brandon Gray, a witness from the group of men dubbed \"Burger Boys\", identified a Series 1 VS Commodore station wagon as cruising past them shortly after Glennon walked past. The vehicle had distinctive tear-drop hubcaps which were present on some Series 1 VS commodores Between April 1996 and December 1998, Edwards drove a white VS Series wagon with Telstra logos. The vehicle was tracked down and impounded on the same day as his arrest.\n\nIt has been suggested by journalist Liam Bartlett that Spiers was not the first victim. He wrote that police have told the father of a fourth missing woman, 22-year-old Julie Cutler, that his daughter was probably a victim of the Claremont killer. Cutler, a university student from Fremantle, vanished after leaving a staff function at the Parmelia Hilton Hotel in Perth at 9:00 pm on 20 June 1988. Her car was found in the surf near the groyne at Cottesloe Beach two days later, and her fate remains unknown.\n\nOther possible cases include that of Lisa Brown (19), a prostitute who disappeared on 10 November 1998, and Sara McMahon (20), who disappeared on 8 November 2000.\n\n\n"}

Since 2013, he serves as professor of Political Studies at Bar-Ilan University (where he also directs the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies). He is also a principal research fellow and former director of the Middle East Forum, a Philadelphia-based think tank. He is a vocal critic of the New Historians, a group of Israeli scholars who have questioned the traditional Israeli narrative of the Arab–Israeli conflict.\n\nBorn and raised in Israel to Jewish immigrants to Palestine under the British Mandate, Karsh graduated in Arabic and Modern Middle East History from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and obtained an MA and PhD in International Relations from Tel Aviv University. After acquiring his first academic degree in modern Middle Eastern history, he was a research analyst for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), where he attained the rank of major.\n\nKarsh has held various academic posts at Harvard and Columbia universities, the Sorbonne, the London School of Economics, Helsinki University, the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies in Washington D.C., and the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University. In 1989 he joined King's College London, where he established the Middle East and Mediterranean Studies Program, directing it for 16 years. He has published extensively on Middle Eastern affairs, Soviet foreign policy, and European neutrality, and is a founding editor of the scholarly journal \"Israel Affairs\", and editor of the \"Middle East Quarterly\". He is a regular media commentator, has appeared on all the main radio and television networks in the United Kingdom and the United States, and has contributed articles to leading newspapers, including \"The New York Times\", \"The Los Angeles Times\",\"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The Times\" (London) and \"The Daily Telegraph\".\n\nIn his 2010 book \"Palestine Betrayed\", followed by a 2011 editorial in \"Haaretz\", Karsh articulated his belief that the 1948 Palestinian exodus was \"exclusively of their own making\". Karsh writes that many Palestinians fled their homes as the result of pressure from local Arab leaders \"and/or the Arab Liberation Army that had entered Palestine prior to the end of the Mandate (Mandatory Palestine), whether out of military considerations or in order to prevent them from becoming citizens of the prospective Jewish state.\" He stated that there is an \"overwhelming and incontrovertible body of evidence\" to support his position including \"intelligence briefs, captured Arab documents, press reports, personal testimonies and memoirs...\" Karsh states that \"the deliberate depopulation of Arab villages and their transformation into military strongholds\" began in December 1947.\n\nKarsh rejects the Palestinian demands for a right of the return. \"However, even if the more restrictive Israeli figures were to be accepted, it is certainly true, just as Amos Oz darkly predicts, that the influx of these refugees into the Jewish State would irrevocably transform its demographic composition. At the moment, Jews constitute about 79 percent of Israel's six-million-plus population, a figure that would rapidly dwindle to under 60 percent. Given the Palestinians' far higher birth rate, the implementation of a 'right of return', even by the most conservative estimates, would be tantamount to Israel's transformation into an 'ordinary' Arab state.\"\n\nKarsh's \"Empires of the Sand: The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, 1789–1922\" was published in 1999, co-written by his wife Inari Rautsi-Karsh.\n\nDaniel Pipes called it a \"tour de force that offers a profoundly new understanding of a key issue in modern Middle Eastern history:\" and said that \" Drawing on a wide range of original sources, and writing in a clearly organized fashion and in fast-paced prose, the Karshes make a very compelling case for their revisionist position, establishing it point by point and in elegant detail\".\n\nAnthony B. Toth wrote in a review: \"This is a polemical book whose authors have extended the intemperate and unbalanced rhetoric customarily employed by dogmatic partisans of the Arab Israeli conflict to the normally sedate and measured arena of nineteenth - and early twentieth-century Ottoman history. The book relies mainly on Western published sources and official British documents. But their use of even these sources is limited, since they actually ignore most of nineteenth-century history. Instead, the authors emphasize those episodes they feel support their interpretations\".\n\nRichard Bulliet, professor of history at the Middle East Institute of Columbia University wrote that \"Empires of the Sand\" is \"a tendentious and unreliable piece of scholarship that should have been vetted more thoroughly by the publisher\" and asserts that the authors failed to \"contribute a dimension of sense and scholarship that raises the debate[s in question] to a higher level.\" Karsh in response wondered \"\"what credential did Bulliet possess, that a leading journal in the field should ask him to review our book? He is a medievalist who has done no research or writing on the subject. But in his spare time, he propagates the view of the Middle East and its nations as hapless victims of Western imperialism. In Middle Eastern studies that in itself is a sufficient credential to pronounce on anything. In his review, Bulliet rushes to absolve the Ottomans of responsibility for crimes they committed in their effort to keep their own empire intact. The evidence be damned - for it would not so well have served Bulliet's interest.\"\".\n\nCharles D. Smith, professor emeritus of Middle East history, states that the book is \"essentially a work of propaganda, but still of use to students who wished to see how scholars could misrepresent sources\". In his 2010 review of the book, Smith says that \"In order to sustain their arguments, the Karshes, as judged by their citations, ignore nearly all scholarship of the past thirty years or more on British policy generally or as it pertained to the Middle East during World War I.\".\n\nKarsh states that his book \"has incurred the ire of the Arabist establishment\" and that \"scathing indictments have been made, on the basis of hearsay, without writers taking the trouble to read the book. A leading academic has even urged fellow academics to place negative reviews on the website of a major Internet bookstore, so as to warn potential readers of our book.\" Karsh further said \"[the]conventional view – absolving Middle Easterners and blaming the West – is academically unsound and morally reprehensible. It is academically unsound because the facts tell an altogether different story of modern Middle Eastern history, one that has consistently been suppressed because of its incongruity with the politically correct dogmas of the Arabist establishment. And it is morally reprehensible because denying the responsibility of individuals and societies for their actions is patronizing and in the worst tradition of the 'white man's burden' approach, which has dismissed regional players as half-witted creatures, too dim to be accountable for their own fate... Little wonder therefore that \"Empires of the Sand\" was more favorably received by Middle Eastern intellectuals, fed up with being talked down to and open to real revisionism of their region's history after suffering decades of condescension from their paternalistic champions in the West.\"\n\nIn 2006 Karsh published \"Islamic Imperialism: A History\", stating that Islam started out as a Great Jihad that lasted over a thousand years, and persisted in the Ottoman Empire right up through World War I, and is still alive today with the jihad against Israel, the 9/11 Attack, al-Qaeda, ISIS, etc.\n\nIn a review, professor of history Richard Bulliet stated:\n\nIn a review, professor of history Robert Tignor stated:The book is timely as well as polemical. Its polemics and its obvious intention to arouse strong responses should not deter readers, since it is a work deserving to be read for its penetrating analyses of the long history of Islam as an expanding and proselytizing faith.Writing in \"International Review of Modern Sociology\", California State University professor Henry E. Chambers concluded his review with the words: \"This politically driven history will lead readers astray and offers a flawed version of the Middle East.\"\n\nIn the review, professor of history Marian Gross writes:The ingenuity of Karsh’s monograph is that it portrays Islamic imperialism in the same light as all other imperialism—accentuating the utter normalcy of Muslim rulers’ imperialist ventures, goals, and means.[...] By seeking the roots of the current situations in the Middle East within the framework of Middle Eastern history, Karsh provides an invaluable assessment.Reviewing the German translation of the book in \"Die Welt Des Islams\", Erlangen University professor of history Thomas Philipp wrote:\n\nJonathan Berkey writes in his review, that the core argument of the book is \"controversial, and many readers will find it unconvincing\". He finds Karsh's \"discussion of premodern Islam misconstrues its history in some important ways\". As for the use of \"Islamic Imperialism\", Berkey says that \"At best, there is a tendency here to fall back on broad and unsupportable generalizations about Islam and Muslims that recent historians have rightly shunned\".\n\nReviewing the book, history professor William E. Watson from Immaculata University writes that \"book destined to become a seminal study on the history of radical Islam\"\n\nKarsh's 2010 book \"Palestine Betrayed\" is about the breakdown of relations between the Jewish and Arab communities between 1920 and 1948.\n\nAccording to Middle East scholar Daniel Pipes: \"With his customary in-depth archival research — in this case, relying on masses of recently declassified documents from the period of British rule and of the first Arab–Israeli war, 1917–49 — clear presentation, and meticulous historical sensibility, Karsh argues the opposite case: that Palestinians decided their own destiny and bear near-total responsibility for becoming refugees.\" \n\nAccording to Karsh:\n\nCharles D. Smith in a review says that throughout the book, Karsh presents the Zionists as \"sincere and open with Palestinians, as are the British\", whereas \"Palestinians and other Arabs, especially their leaders, are corrupt and untrustworthy\". Karsh, according to Smith, deliberately distorted the main thrust of the Peel Commission Report and is \"incapable of accepting the idea of Palestinian national aspirations\".\n\nIsraeli historian Benny Morris describes Karsh's portrayal of Britain's role as betraying the Jews and ultimately reneging on their commitment to support Jewish statehood as \"one-sided and without nuance\".\n\nHoward Sachar sees Karsh as the \"preeminent scholar-spokesman of the Revisionist (politically-rightist) Movement in Zionism.\"\n\nAuthor David Rodman opined, \"Karsh stitches together a seemingly irrefutable case for the validity of the traditionalist narrative, possibly bringing to an end once and for all the New Historian phenomenon as a sustainable historiographical project.\"\n\nProminent New Historian Benny Morris called Karsh's \"Fabricating Israeli History\" \"a mélange of distortions, half-truths, and plain lies that vividly demonstrates his profound ignorance of both the source material... and the history of the Zionist-Arab conflict,\" titling his article \"Undeserving of a Reply\". Morris adds that Karsh belabors minor points while ignoring the main pieces of evidence.\n\nPolitical scientist Ian Lustick commented that Karsh's writing in \"Fabricating Israeli History\" was malevolent, and his analysis erratic and sloppy.\n\nYezid Sayigh, professor of Middle East studies, wrote that Karsh \"is simply not what he makes himself out to be, a trained historian (nor political/social scientist).\" Karsh accused Sayigh of a \"misleading misrepresentation of my scholarly background\" and retorted that Sayigh's remarks were \"not a scholarly debate on facts and theses but a character assassination couched in high pseudo-academic rhetoric\".\n\nIn a review of \"Rethinking the Middle East\", el-Aswad writes \"It seems, in many cases, that whatever does not match the author's views is charged with fraud and deception\".\n\n\n"}

Fellow explorer William Hann was his older brother. They were born in Wiltshire, England and migrated with the family to the Western Port area of Victoria in 1851. In 1862 the family moved to the Burdekin River district, just north of Charters Towers in Queensland.\n\nThe Hann family with Richard Daintree and two others took up several holdings along the Clarke River, a tributary of the Burdekin River. The properties included Lolworth, Maryvale and Kangerong Stations. The young Hann boys grew up handling cattle and when their father died in January 1864, followed by their mother in June the same year, they assumed responsibility for the family's share of the properties. Frank became manager of Lolworth prior to turning 20 years old. By 1875 he had done well enough to stock Lawn Hill station with wild cattle, and for twenty years made a business of supplying cattle to widespread goldfields throughout Queensland and the Northern Territory. In 1881 he acted as a guide on a survey for a proposed transcontinental railway in northern Queensland. He discovered deposits of silver and lead in the Lawn Hill area, but commercial operation of the finds did not occur until 100 years later, leading to the present name of Century Mine.\n\nAn escaped prisoner named Joe Flick nearly ended Hann's life in 1889. Flick was hiding in Hann's Lawn Hill homestead after fatally shooting a policeman (Alfred Wavell), when Hann confronted him upon returning home. The intruder agreed to converse with Hann but instead shot him in the chest at close range. Hann survived, but Flick was cornered and shot dead by other police in the early hours next morning.\n\nBy 1895 economic conditions had taken a downturn resulting in Hann walking off the station. He decided to try his luck in the north of Western Australia, so in 1896 with six aboriginal companions and 67 horses he travelled overland from Lawn Hill to Halls Creek. Once in the west, despite being more than 50 years old, he carried out numerous expeditions partly financed by the government. In 1897 from a base at Nullagine, Hann explored the east Pilbara, and noticed creeks in the area flowed inland. He followed them expecting to find a large fresh water lake, but to his disappointment the lake turned out to be salt. Consequently, he named the feature Lake Disappointment.\n\nHann's explorations covered a great deal of the state while searching for mineral wealth and pastoral prospects. From 1903 he based himself in a tent about 10 kilometres east of Laverton. His expeditions from the locality (shown as \"Hann's Camp\" on modern maps), extended as far as the Petermann Ranges in central Australia and Oodnadatta in South Australia. He left a legacy having named over 500 geographical features, including the rivers Rudall, Isdell, Charnley and Phillips (now the Hann); lakes Yeo and Rason; and ranges Mackay, Sir Frederick Bedford and McFadden Range.\n\nIn 1918 he was injured in an accident which left him on crutches after which he retired to Perth, where he died in 1921. He was buried in the Karrakatta cemetery in Perth, and in October 1986 a memorial plaque was added to the gravesite.\n\nFrank Hann National Park, Hann River and Mount Hann are named in his honour.\n\n"}

He participated in the Revolution of 1868, that removed Isabella II out of the power and led the coup d'état which finished with the First Republic, giving way to the Restoration and Isabella's son Alfonso XII.\n\nHis military career started in 1841 when he entered the Royal Artillery College at Segovia. He became a lieutenant in 1846 and a captain in 1855. Pavía returned to Spain after fighting in the Hispano-Moroccan War (1859–60) and in the European expedition of Mexico in 1862; in the latter year he was proclaimed major.\n\nHis first important intervention in the Spanish history took place in January 1866, being commander under the order of the general Juan Prim. He participated in an unsuccessful mutiny against the regime of Isabella II, ruined in Madrid. Prim left the Liberal Union of O'Donnell and entered the new Progressive Party. At the end of that year, Pavía and Prim organised a mutiny with other generals, but this rebellion didn't succeed because of the lack of popular and military support.\n\nO'Donnell sent a detachment to detain the conspirators. Prim and Pavía started an escape to Portugal, persecuted by Zavala and Echagüe. During the escape they received many support from the Spanish population.\n\nAfter two years of exile, Pavía returned to Spain collaborating again with the general Prim, but this time he begun a successful revolutionary movement in August 1866 with the Pact of Ostende with the Democratic Party.\n\nThe armed insurrection broke out in Andalucía, prepared by the revolutionary Juntas composed by democrats and progressives, which actuated in favour of a military conspiracy. In September 1868, after proclaiming the manifest \"España con honra\", Prim disembarked in Cádiz. On 28 September he won the battle of Alcolea and the support of Barcelona and the Mediterranean coast was decisive for the victory of the revolution. The queen abandoned the country in September 30 and it was constituted a provisional government under the reign of the general Francisco Serrano.\n\nDuring this period, Pavía fought in Navarra at the beginning of the Third Carlist War. In 1873, (with the First Republic proclaimed) with the general Arsenio Martínez Campos, ruled the repression of the cantonalist insurrection, initiated 12 July of that year during the presidency of Pi y Margall in Cartagena which pretended to constitute a federation of the autonomic territorial organizations of the central power.\n\nPavía and Martínez Campos took one by one almost all the cantons between July 26 and August 8, being the president Emilio Castelar, only the canton of Cartagena resisted until January 13 of the next year. At the end of 1873, Pavía occupied again the charge of Captain general of \"Castilla la Nueva\", with the headquarters in Madrid, function that performed when the president Castelar, (during the first days of 1874), asked the \"Congreso de los Diputados\" for a vote of confidence which was rejected.\n\nOn 3 January Pavía, (which political posture was favourable to the united centralism) presented himself in the Congress and ordered to evacuate the building at the moment that it would proceed to a new presidential election ruled by a federalist. With the coup d'état finished, it started like this the named \"Fase Pretoriana\" of the First Republic, led by Francisco Serrano (Duque de la Torre), which rapidly would give way to the return of the monarchy of the House of Bourbon with Alfonso XII, son of Isabella II.\nDuring the Restoration, Pavía was the captain general of Catalonia from 1880 until 1881 and again captain general of \"Castilla la Nueva\" in 1885, under the regency of María Cristina de Habsburgo-Lorena. In 1886, applying this charge, he defeated in Madrid the popular anti-dynastic Manuel Villacampa.\n\nDuring his last years of life, was promoted to captain general, was president of the \"Consejo Supremo de Guerra y Marina\" and wrote different military history stories. Manuel Pavía died on January 4, 1895.\n\n"}

He went on to pass the Japanese bar examination in 1979, specializing in tax law, and he registered as an attorney in 1982 after completing his legal training.\n\nTanigaki was prepared for a legal career after close to ten years of study, but his father, who represented the 2nd district in Kyoto, died in 1983. He moved to Kyoto to run for his father's seat. He briefly headed the Science and Technology Agency in 1997. Under the then prime minister Koizumi, he served in a number of positions, including the Financial Reconstruction Commission, the National Public Safety Commission, and ultimately as Minister of Finance from 22 September 2003 to 26 September 2006. Since 2002, Tanigaki has led a minor faction in the Liberal Democratic Party, formerly part of the \"Kochikai\" faction, with 11 members in the lower house and 4 in the upper house.\n\nTanigaki declared his candidacy for the LDP presidency on July 28, 2006, but came in third place in a three-way race against Shinzō Abe and Tarō Asō. Tanigaki was viewed as the \"moderate\" candidate in the race, mainly due to his foreign policy views: unlike Abe and Asō, he stated that he would not continue visits to Yasukuni Shrine if he became prime minister, which made him a more attractive candidate among LDP leaders who sought better relations with China and Korea leader. Tanigaki is affiliated to the openly revisionist lobby Nippon Kaigi, which advocates visits of Prime Ministers to the controversial shrine.\n\nOn 24 September 2007, Tanigaki was named chief policymaker of the LDP by newly elected party president Yasuo Fukuda. He was subsequently appointed as minister of construction and transport on 1 August 2008.\n\nOn 28 September 2009, he was elected by his party as LDP leader to replace former prime minister Tarō Asō after the Democratic Party of Japan achieved a landslide election result in the 2009 general election and took government from the LDP.\n\nIn the early period of the Democratic Party of Japan government, Tanigaki frequently condemned the DPJ for advocating for a rise in the sales taxes by 5 percent, in spite of the enormous, problematic national deficit, and despite his own past calls to increase the tax.\n\nTo gain a potential legislative LDP-coalition majority, he attempted an unsuccessful no-confidence motion against Naoto Kan in June 2011, after refusing Kan's earlier offers of a grand coalition.\n\nIn 2012, the LDP under Tanigaki worked with prime minister Yoshihiko Noda of the ruling DPJ to pass an increase in the consumption tax from the current 5% to 8% in April 2014 and 10% in October 2015. He agreed not to introduce a no-confidence motion or a censure motion against Noda, in return for Noda's promise to hold elections \"soon.\" On 28 August 2012, soon after the consumption tax bills were passed through the diet a censure motion was passed by the LDP and the New Komeito Party against Prime Minister Noda. The opposition parties were to boycott debate in the chamber, meaning that any new bills passed in the DPJ-controlled House of Representatives cannot be enacted.\n\nTanigaki had expected to be re-elected as LDP head unopposed in 2012, but former Prime Minister Shinzō Abe and several others suggested that they could run against him. He lost the party election to Abe on 26 September 2012. As a result, he became only the second LDP leader, after Yōhei Kōno (1993–1995), who never served as Prime Minister.\n\nTanigaki injured his spinal cord in a bicycle accident in July 2016, and remained hospitalized as of September 2017. He stayed out of the public eye during his hospitalization, and was rumored to be planning a comeback to politics as of mid-2017, but decided not to run in the 2017 general election due to his physical condition. Details of his condition have not been made public, but Tanigaki made the announcement from a rehabilitation facility where he was photographed in a wheelchair.\n\n"}

He created more than 400 works during his career, 200 of which are displayed in the Albin Polasek Museum & Sculpture Gardens in Winter Park, Florida.\n\nBorn as Albín Polášek in Frenštát, Moravia, part of the Austria-Hungary (now in the Czech Republic), Polasek apprenticed as a wood carver in Vienna. At the age of 22, he emigrated to the United States and began formal art training at age 25 under Charles Grafly at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. As a student, he first produced \"Man Carving His Own Destiny\" (1907) and \"Eternal Moment\" (1909). In 1909, Polasek became an American citizen; in 1910, he won the Rome Prize competition; in 1913, he received honorable mention at the Paris Salon for \"The Sower;\" in 1915, he took the Widener Gold Medal from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts for his sculpture \"Aspiration.\"\n\nAt age 37, after periods of residence in Rome and New York City, he was invited to head the sculpture department at the Art Institute of Chicago, where he remained for nearly 30 years. While there he created the original \"Forest Idyll\"; \"Victorious Christ\" for St. Cecelia's Cathedral in Omaha, Nebraska; Kenilworth Memorial relief, Kenilworth, Illinois; \"The Spirit of Music\" in Grant Park in Chicago; the \"Woodrow Wilson Memorial\" in Prague, Czech Republic; Governor Richard Yates sculpture, capital grounds, Springfield, Illinois; and many other works. Polasek was elected an associate member of the National Academy of Design in 1927 and full member in 1933.\n\nAlbin Polasek was a close friend of fellow artist Louis Grell while he lived at Tree Studios in Chicago. The Grell Family archive collection contains letters by Grell discussing Polasek's move to Florida and becoming ill shortly after.\n\nIn 1950, Polasek retired at age 70 to Winter Park, Florida. Within months, he suffered a stroke that left his left side paralyzed; he subsequently completed 18 major works with his right hand only, including \"Victory of Moral Law\", the artist's comment on the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Toward the end of 1950, at age 71, he married former student Ruth Sherwood, who died 22 months later in October 1952. In 1961, Polasek married Emily Muska Kubat. Upon his death in 1965, Polasek was buried beside his first wife in Winter Park's Palm Cemetery, where his \"12th Station of the Cross\" (1939) is his monument. Emily M.K. Polasek died in 1988.\n\nPolasek's better-known works include the \"Theodore Thomas Memorial\" (1924), the 1941 memorial to Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk in Chicago, the \"Wilson Memorial\" (1928), \"Radigast\" (1929) and \"Sts. Cyril and Methodius\" (1929) in the Czech Republic. His \"Mother Crying Over the World\" (1942) was a response to World War II and his \"Victory of Moral Law\" (1956) to the Hungarian Revolution.\n\nLike many other sculptors of his era, Polasek created several cemetery memorials. Notable among these are \"The Pilgrim\" and \"The Mother\" (1927), both located in the Bohemian National Cemetery in Chicago, and the \"Pilgrim at the Eternal Gate\" in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio. Pictures of all three are featured in both biographies listed in the sources section.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1825221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825221", "title": "Royal Selangor Club", "text": "Royal Selangor Club\n\nThe Royal Selangor Club () is a social club in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, founded in 1884 by the British who ruled Malaya. The club is situated next to the \"Dataran Merdeka\", or Independence Square, \"padang\" (field), and is accessible from Jalan Raja (King Road). The Club will play host to certain matches from the ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup.\n\nThe club was founded as the Selangor Club in 1884 as a meeting point for educated and high-ranking members of British colonial society. Most of its early members were British, the founding members include H.C. Syers, the Superintendent of Selangor State; A.R. Venning, Treasurer of Selangor and head of the Sanitation Board (who also created the Lake Gardens); A. C. Norman who designed some early buildings of Kuala Lumpur; and H.F. Bellamy who headed the Selangor Public Works Department. Nevertheless, membership to the club is primarily determined by high educational standard or social standing, rather than race or citizenship; for example an original founding member was Thamboosamy Pillay and its first Secretary was a German, Count Bernstorff. Count Bernstorff however left the club with an unexplained deficit of $1,100, and later Henry Huttenbach steadied the club's finances as the Secretary. The club house was built with funds from the British colonial administration, and the British Resident of Selangor was \"ex officio\" the President of the club – the first three Presidents were John Pickersgill Rodger, William Edward Maxwell, and Frank Swettenham.\n\nThe club was initially based in a small wooden building with an attap roof near the north eastern corner of the \"padang\". In 1890, this early building was replaced by a two-storey structure designed by A.C.A. Norman, a Government Architect, at the present site of the club on the west side of the \"padang\". The building was then rebuilt in 1910 using a design by architect Arthur Benison Hubback (notably credited with the design of the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station) in Mock Tudor styling, with two additional wings on either side of the main building.\n\nThe club was nicknamed \"The Spotted Dog\", one explanation is that it referred to its mixed community membership and began with a remark that \"frequenters of The Spotted Dog pub must accept the company as they find it\". Another suggestion it refers to two Dalmatians that belonging to the wife of H. C. Syers, one of the club founders and left to guard the entrance of the club whenever they visited the club. Yet another suggestion is that the first emblem club was supposedly a spotted leopard that was so badly drawn that some mistook it for a dog. The club is also simply referred to as \"The Dog\".\n\nOver the years, the club's membership increased and had also begun to include high-ranking Malaysian civil servants: judges, lawyers and important people in society. The club's proximity to the old High Courts at the other side of \"Dataran Merdeka\" has also made the club a popular meeting place for the legal fraternity.\n\nThe Royal Selangor Club was not spared from frequent flooding in Kuala Lumpur. Between the start of the 1910s and the 1930s, the club was recorded to be hit by floods in 1911, 1917, December 1925 and December 1926.\n\nOn 20 December 1970, the main section of the club was razed in a fire which was believed to have started from its kitchen at around 10.30 p.m. and was contained within an hour by 50 fire fighters (including 20 who were off-duty). Property damage from the fire was estimated to cost more than M$1.5 million, but there were no casualties. During the fire, guests of a children's Christmas party in the club were safely evacuated with \"no panic\". The then president of the club, Khir Johari, stated that the club was insured for M$1 million. Shortly after, another flood struck Kuala Lumpur and the club premises three days after the start of 1971.\n\nWhile the club is more than 100 years old, much of its early records were lost during the three-year Japanese occupation of Malaya from 1942 to 1945, and the 1970 fire that damaged the club .\n\nAfter the fire, plans were made by the club to rebuild what was damaged. Proposals were made on a new wing and submitted to the Kuala Lumpur City Hall in 1972. However, City Hall was suggesting the construction of a civic center over the site of the club's field and club. The initial response by the club was to search for a new site in the surrounding area (including Jalan Duta, an area near the Houses of Parliament, an area near a polo club in Ampang, and Damansara) with little success. Discussions were eventually made with City Hall to agree on the club's rebuilding. As a result, plans for a civic center in the area were abandoned, and City Hall granted the reconstruction of the club's new building in July 1978. The new wing, which was built in a similar Mock Tudor style as the rest of the club building, was constructed between 5 November 1978 to December 1980 at a cost of M$6 million.\n\nThe club has organised various sporting activities since its early years, including cricket (where it has been a key player in the history of cricket in Malaysia). Rugby Union has been played at the Club since 1894.\n\nSporting events at the club can be viewed from the Long Bar, a portion of the club which has been off limits to women, purportedly because men \"would drink and get very excited when they watched the games and they didn't want the ladies to see their exuberant behaviour, hence it was decided to ban women visitors from the Long Bar\". Women are still prohibited from the bar area today, contrary to a 2007 report by \"The Star\", a local English daily.\n\nMembers of the club is said to have introduced hash running in 1938. Legend has it that some members of the Selangor Club decided that it would be a good idea to run to work after heavy drinking the night before so they could rid themselves of their hangovers, which apparently they did. As the club was once also called Hash House (so named because some of its members thought its food unpalatable) the members therefore named themselves Hash House Harriers. During the World Interhash in 1998, an exception was made to allow women into the Long Bar.\n\nThe field or \"padang\" fronting the Royal Selangor Club, now known as \"Dataran Merdeka\", had long been used by the Club but was leased from the Government under a \"Temporary Occupation License - TOL\" before it was taken back by the Kuala Lumpur City Hall in 1987 to be used specifically for events organised by City Hall. Throughout the time the field was used by the club, sporting activities such as cricket, rugby, hockey and football matches were held there almost on a daily basis. The club's loss of the field was compensated with a piece of land in Bukit Kiara, which is currently the site of the Royal Selangor Club Bukit Kiara Annexe.\n\nEffort has been made to accumulate support from various bodies to recognise the club as a national heritage building and institution, due to its intertwined link with the country's history.\n\nThe club is one of the oldest in the country, serving as a British institution, and is witness to the first hoisting of the Malayan flag in place of the Union Jack on the night of 30 August 1957 and declaration of independence by Tunku Abdul Rahman (to which club members broke into cheers of happiness), signifying the country's independence from the British. In 1984, the club was awarded a royal status under the patronage of the Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah, who has voiced his support for the club's preservation during its 100th anniversary celebration, stating that \"This institution should remain forever.\"\n\nThe Royal Selangor Club Kiara Sport Annexe is a branch of the Royal Selangor Club built over a piece of land in Bukit Kiara 5.5 kilometres away from the original clubhouse, which was given as compensation after the original club's field was acquired by the Kuala Lumpur City Hall in 1987. The facility was officially opened on 7 June 1998 by then Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Jaafar. The annexe is laid out in a similar manner as the original club, with the main club building facing a large field and designed in a similar architectural style as the original club building. The annexe also includes a swimming pool at the rear of the building.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1825226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825226", "title": "2002 European floods", "text": "2002 European floods\n\nIn August 2002 a flood caused by over a week of continuous heavy rains ravaged Europe, killing dozens, dispossessing thousands, and causing damage of billions of euros in Russia, the Czech Republic, Austria, Germany, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania and Croatia. The flood was of a magnitude expected to occur roughly once a century. Unprecedented flood heights were recorded and at least 110 people died. In December 2002, total economic damage estimates exceeded 15 billion Euro, of which 15% was insured.\n\nFlooding resulted from the passage of two Genoa low pressure systems (named Hanne and Ilse by the Free University of Berlin) which brought warm moist air from the Mediterranean northwards. The effects of El Niño are believed to have possibly contributed although others disagree. The floods started with heavy rainfall in the Eastern Alps, which resulted in floods in Northern Italy, Bavaria and the Austrian states of Salzburg and Upper Austria. The floods gradually moved eastwards along the Danube, although the damage in the large cities on its shores was not as severe as in the areas affected by the floods later.\n\nWhen the rainfall moved northeast to the Bohemian Forest and to the source areas of the Elbe and Vltava rivers, the result were catastrophic water levels first in the Austrian areas of Mühlviertel and Waldviertel and later in the Czech Republic, Thuringia and Saxony. Rivers changed their courses in unexpected ways, catching residents off guard. Several villages in Northern Bohemia, Thuringia and Saxony were more or less destroyed by rivers changing their courses or massively overflowing their banks.\n\nThe floods that hit Europe during August 2002 were part of a larger system that was also affecting Asia. Within Europe, however, the areas that sustained significant damage included the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Italy, Spain, Germany, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, and Ukraine. Several rivers in the region, including the Vltava, Elbe and Danube reached record highs.\n\nPrague received significant damage from what were deemed to be the worst floods ever to hit the capital. The flow of Vltava culminated at 5300 m³/s, 20% more than during the flood of 1845. Among the regions of the capital city most severely affected were: Karlín, Kampa, Holešovice and Libeň, where there was significant risk of building collapse. Most of Prague's art work was saved due to advance warning of high water levels, however there was significant damage to the Prague Metro subway system, much of which was completely flooded, as well as to the historic Prague pneumatic post, which was forced to cease operation.\n\nPrague's Jewish Quarter also received significant damage, a part of the estimated $30 million in damage to Czech cultural sites including: the Prague Municipal Library, Malá Strana, the National Theatre and Terezín.\n\nThe evacuations before the worst of the flooding have been cited as one of the reasons for relatively little loss of life in the capital. An estimated 40,000 people were evacuated from Prague. One of the most visible victims of the summer's flood was Gaston, a sea lion from the Prague Zoo who swam to Germany following the flooding of his aquarium. For some time, it was believed he would survive, however he died following capture in Dresden.\n\nIn total, 17 people lost their lives in the Czech Republic due to the floods, and damage from the flood was estimated at between 70 and 73 billion CZK. The damage to the Prague metro has been estimated at approximately 7 billion CZK.\n\nGermany was the hardest hit, with over two-thirds of the flood's total losses. The 10 years of renovation work that had been carried out since reunification in 1990 in the town of Grimma, in the former East Germany, were said to have been destroyed in one night.\n\nDresden received significant damage when the Elbe River reached an all-time high of 9.4 meters (30.8 feet). More than 30,000 people were evacuated from various neighborhoods throughout the city and some of the city's cultural landmarks were considered to be at risk.\n\nDresden's Zwinger Palace, home to a significant number of Europe's artistic treasures including Raphael's Sistine Madonna was at risk from the flooding Elbe, however all of the art works could be saved. The Semper Opera House also suffered damage.\n\nThe Black Sea Coast region was among the most severely hit regions of Russia with significant loss of life due to a tornado that hit the tourist region and destroyed homes. This was after earlier summer floods in southern Russia. All told, damage in the region was calculated at more than $400 million.\n\nAlthough all of Europe was affected to some degree or another from the record rains that fell, some cities were spared the severe flooding that hit Dresden and Prague.\n\nAlthough the Danube reached record highs, both Bratislava and Vienna were spared significant flooding. Bratislava's sparing was due to the city's flood protection measures, which withstood the water, while it was generally believed that Vienna was spared significant damage due the city's engineering, and plans were undertaken to see if such work could be applied to the other cities as well. The floods also hit Budapest, with 1,700 people evacuated.\n\nOnce the water levels returned to normal and residents returned to their homes, they faced not only the damage left by the flood waters but also threats of disease due to decaying waste and food. The danger increased due to flooding of sewage treatment plants and the risk of damage to chemical plants.\n\nOnce the waters began to recede, European leaders gathered in Berlin to discuss the effects of the floods and to create a better understanding of how to prevent such disasters in the future. This meeting garnered some criticism, as Russia, which had suffered significant damage, was not invited to what was billed as a meeting of EU members and future members. The EU leaders did promise aid to the central European countries that suffered the most under the floods with monies coming from the EU's structural budget and this outreach to non-members was seen as symbolic in an effort to portray a truly united Europe.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1825227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825227", "title": "Murder of Peter Falconio", "text": "Murder of Peter Falconio\n\nPeter Falconio was a British tourist who disappeared in a remote part of the Stuart Highway near Barrow Creek in the Northern Territory of Australia on the evening of 14 July 2001, while travelling with his girlfriend Joanne Lees. In the aftermath of the Backpacker murders, the case quickly attracted considerable public and legal attention both domestically and worldwide. Falconio was 28 years old at the time of the disappearance. His body has never been found and he is now presumed dead. On 13 December 2005, Bradley John Murdoch was convicted of his murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nPeter Marco Falconio (20 September 1972 – 14 July 2001) was the third of four sons, in a family who lived in Hepworth, West Yorkshire, England. In 1996, he started a relationship with Joanne Lees (born 1973) after meeting her in a local nightclub, and she began living with him the following year in Brighton, where Falconio was studying at Brighton University. On 15 November 2000, the couple embarked on a trip to Nepal, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Australia (though recent news of the backpacker murders, the Port Arthur killings, and the Childers Palace Backpackers Hostel fire there had made their families anxious about that final leg of the trip). By 16 January 2001, the couple had arrived in Sydney on a working holiday visa, and on 25 June, they departed on a road trip planned as Sydney to Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Darwin, and Brisbane.\n\nAround 7:30 pm on the night of Saturday 14 July 2001, Falconio and Lees were travelling on the Stuart Highway bound for the Devil's Marbles in their orange Kombi. Falconio was driving and Lees sat next to him in the passenger seat. The two had been conscious of a car that had been following them since they stopped at a roadhouse in Barrow Creek, and were expecting to be overtaken. However, when the vehicle - a white Toyota 4WD with a green canopy - drew alongside, the driver gestured excitedly at them to pull over. Falconio stopped the van and went to speak with the man, who had pulled off the road ahead of them. The man explained he had seen sparks shooting out of the van's exhaust.\n\nThe two went to the rear of the vehicle to investigate, and Lees moved into the driver's seat, ready to rev the engine. She then heard a loud bang from the rear of the van, and moments later the man was at the window brandishing a silver gun. He climbed into the van, and she let him secure her hands behind her back with black cable ties, but fought the tying of her feet and taping of her mouth. Lees was then dragged to the man's vehicle (noticing the man's dog), but, fearing rape, she fled into the bush while he was distracted (apparently while moving Falconio's body). The man searched for her before leaving, passing nearby three times, but she hid before finally flagging down a road train driver at 12:35 am, who took her back to Barrow Creek.\n\nThe Alice Springs Police were called around 1:30 am, arrived to collect evidence and testimonies at around 4:20 am, and (accompanied by the truck driver) commenced a search for Falconio, the vehicle, and the gunman at 7:00 am. Returning to the scene, they found a dirt-covered blood pool and the couple's Kombi hidden some 80 metres into the scrub. It was not until eight hours after the rescue that roadblocks were put in place on the twelve likely roads exiting the district. Police searches of the area in the following months revealed little except Lees' footprints, but four Aboriginal trackers arrived from a nearby settlement within a few days, though none of them found evidence of either Falconio or the attacker.\n\nGiven the unusual nature of the attack, and the lack of corroborating evidence (i.e. Falconio's belongings or body), it took the police some days to appreciate the significance of the crime. But in the wake of the Backpacker case, the media were quick to sensationalise Lees' story as one of survival in a crime of unusual horror against all odds. However, inconsistencies in Lees' statements and her demeanour in the following weeks shifted attention to the veracity of her version of the incident (e.g. the perpetrator's facial composite, the actual type of vehicle or dog, and assumed CCTV footage of the suspect in Alice Springs), similar to what had happened in the Azaria Chamberlain case. A $250,000 reward was posted, but the only new evidence in the Falconio case was an unidentified male-DNA trace on Lees' T-shirt, and some related DNA on the cable ties and Kombi gearstick.\n\nPolice were hopeful that the release of the CCTV footage would lead to the person shown coming forward to remove themselves from suspicion. When this did not happen, investigators began to focus on the registered owners of the 1991-1999 model Toyota Land Cruiser 4WD identified, and on the 36 men whom callers had identified in the footage. Based on these results, police interviewed Bradley John Murdoch in Broome on 1 November 2001, though Lees' descriptions did not immediately connect the case to him and no DNA sample was collected. On 17 May 2002, the investigating task force caught Murdoch's drug-running accomplice, who began to relate details of his connections to the case, and a DNA examination of Murdoch's brother also supported his involvement. Murdoch then disappeared, but on 22 August 2002 he was arrested and tried on an unrelated kidnap and assault charge by South Australia Police.\n\nAfter extradition, a committal hearing began in April 2005. The trial began on 17 October 2005 before the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in Darwin. To cope with the demands of the trial and the huge media contingent covering the proceedings, the court building in Darwin was renovated at a cost of A$900,000. The judge was Brian Ross Martin QC, Chief Justice of the Northern Territory. Murdoch pleaded not guilty to charges of murdering Falconio and assaulting and attempting to kidnap Lees.\n\nLees had identified Murdoch from police photographs shown to her in November 2002 and finally face-to-face during the trial on 18 October. She also told the court that her assailant tied her wrists together behind her, put a sack over her head and forced her into his ute, stating that the person forced her between the seats of and into the rear of his vehicle. Lees said she escaped from the ute and fled into the dark, hiding under bushes, while he tried to find her with a torch. Expert trackers, however, could find no sign of tracks other than Lees' in the vicinity.\n\nMurdoch was found to have left Alice Springs at a time and in a direction that could have led to him being at or around Barrow Creek at the time of the murder. Expert testimony presented at the trial indicated that Murdoch was the man captured in the CCTV footage at the service station at 12:38 am. The police found traces of his DNA on a pair of homemade handcuffs that Murdoch had used in the attack. This, combined with the DNA match on Lees' T-shirt, allowed Murdoch to be charged with the murder. The T-shirt DNA was found to be \"150 quadrillion times more likely [to] belong to Murdoch\" than anyone else.\n\nMurdoch's defence argued during the trial that the DNA match could have been due to accidental blood transfer in an Alice Springs Red Rooster restaurant prior to the alleged offence, or could have been simply planted by persons unknown. Further samples were found to be contaminated and were not presented as evidence. Murdoch gave evidence that he had stopped at the restaurant to buy chicken for himself and his dog. During the committal hearing, Lees at one stage mentioned that she and Falconio had stopped at Red Rooster.\n\nEyewitnesses claimed they had seen Falconio at a petrol station, a week after he went missing. Prosecutor Rex Wild, QC, dismissed these claims, arguing that each account gave conflicting information, in particular about the man's hair colour. He pointed out that the police had followed up various eye-witness accounts, all of which had proven fruitless. Falconio's body has never been found \"despite one of the most exhaustive police investigations ever seen in Australia\". On 13 December 2005, Murdoch was found guilty by a jury in a unanimous verdict and he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 28 years. He was also convicted of other assault-related charges on Lees. Only after the sentencing was it revealed that Murdoch had previously been charged and acquitted with aggravated sexual assault on a mother and daughter in South Australia some years earlier.\n\nOn 12 December 2006, Murdoch appealed against his life sentence in the Supreme Court. His lawyers lodged eight grounds of appeal. Murdoch claimed the evidence of Lees was tainted because she had seen a photograph of him on the internet before she was interviewed by police, as well as an article linking him to the murder. On 10 January 2007, the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal (NT CCA) dismissed both limbs of the appeal.\n\nMurdoch then applied for Special Leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia. On 21 June 2007, the High Court refused to grant Special Leave. Under the Australian judicial system, Murdoch has now exhausted all opportunities of appeal. Subsequent to the High Court of Australia refusing to grant his application for Special Leave, there was media speculation that Murdoch would lodge a further appeal. He launched another appeal to the Northern Territory criminal court of appeal in 2013.\n\nIn April 2006, \"The Bulletin\" reported that Murdoch had refused to be served chicken while incarcerated during the committal and trial, claiming he was allergic to it, and that he has a standing medical certificate at Darwin's maximum security Berrimah Prison where he had a \"prison dietitian assigned to create a special menu\" due to this allergy, requesting that he never be served chicken. This contradicted his defence at trial that his DNA might have been transferred onto Lees' clothing while buying chicken for himself and his dog.\n\nIn mid-August 2007, some sections of the Australian media speculated that Murdoch might soon reveal the whereabouts of Falconio's remains. Specifically, the press mentioned that Murdoch did not enjoy the conditions of the Berrimah Prison and might reveal the location of Falconio's body in exchange for a transfer to a prison in Western Australia, given that all avenues of appeal had been exhausted. Murdoch himself has spoken out against this idea.\n\nAuthor Keith Allan Noble insists Murdoch is innocent and offers a reward of £25,000 to anyone who can prove that Falconio is still alive. His 2011 book \"Find! Falconio\" outlines what he describes as \"the show trial in which the jury was lied to and pressure-cooked resulting in a shocking miscarriage of justice\". Noble's writings, which also cover the Port Arthur massacre, have been described by several journalists as conspiracy theories.\n\nIn April 2017, the \"NT News\" received an anonymous letter claiming that Murdoch had \"cut [Falconio]'s body up\" and placed it in two large bags. The letter claimed that an associate was asked to dissolve the remains in acid and dispose of them in the Swan River in Perth, but the associate had instead gone past Geraldton and buried the bags unopened in remote Western Australia. The \"NT News\" forwarded the letter to Northern Territory Police, who said they were reviewing the letter.\n\nIn 2005, while Murdoch's trial was still under way, the film \"Wolf Creek\" was released in Australia. As the film was marketed as being \"based on true events\", the Northern Territory court placed an injunction on its release within the Territory, in the belief that it could influence the outcome of the proceedings. However, the movie was inspired by other murders around Australia, such as the Backpacker murders, as well as the Falconio case.\n\nLees agreed to a televised interview with Martin Bashir, which was later televised in Australia, for which she was paid £50,000. She later testified in court that she had agreed to the interview to raise awareness of the case in Australia, as she felt the public profile of the case had diminished. Lees wrote \"No Turning Back\", a book about her life, for which she reportedly received an advance of £250,000. She went to England for the launch of the book in October 2006 and a serialisation appeared in \"The Times\" newspaper on 2 and 3 October. On 10 October 2006, Lees was interviewed by BBC News 24.\n\nIn March 2007, Australia's Channel Ten presented a docudrama covering the murder and trial from Lees' perspective, entitled \"\". The roles of Lees and Falconio were played by Joanne Froggatt and Laurence Breuls, respectively. It was also shown by ITV1 in the United Kingdom on 8 April 2007, by TV One in New Zealand on 10 June 2007, and by RTL 2 in Germany on 12 January 2009. The case was also covered by \"Casefile True Crime Podcast\" on 28 January 2017.\n\n"}

During his playing career, he played for Danish club Viborg FF, three MLS teams, as well as the United States national team.\n\nBurns was most recently the general manager for the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer.\n\nBurns was born and raised in Marlborough, Massachusetts. At age six, he began playing soccer in local recreation leagues, but never joined a club team. When he reached high school, he played for Marlborough High School boys' team and was named the 1987 Massachusetts High School Player of the Year. \n\nAfter completing high school, he attended Hartwick College from 1988 to 1991. When he graduated from Hartwick, there were few opportunities for playing soccer professionally in the United States, but Burns continued to play with the U.S. Olympic team as it prepared for the 1992 Summer Olympics. He previously played in the 1987 U16 FIFA World Cup and in the 1989 U-20 FIFA World Cup. The 1989 squad took fourth place in the tournament.\n\nIn 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.\n\nOn April 10, 2005, Burns was named as the New England Revolution's Director of Soccer. He held this position until 2008, when he was promoted to Vice President of Player Personnel. On November 9, 2011, he was promoted to the General Manager position.\n\nBurns was dismissed by New England on May 13, 2019. \n\nBurns competed in a major tournament on every level: in the U-17 World Championship in 1987, the World Youth Championship in 1989, the Pan American Games in 1991, the Olympic Games in 1992, and the FIFA World Cup, where he was a non-playing squad member in 1994 and then played in 1998.\n\n"}

The officeholder chairs both the states-provincial (directly elected provincial legislature) and the provincial-executive (executive branch), but has a right to vote only in the latter. When the reigning monarch is a female, the office is Queen's commissioner (\"Commissaris van de Koningin\"). As there are twelve provinces in the Netherlands, there are twelve King's Commissioners.\n\nThere are two levels of local government in the Netherlands: the provinces and the municipalities. The twelve provinces form the tier of administration between central government and the municipalities. The three tiers are organised in largely the same way, with a directly elected legislature, which in turn chooses the executive branch, headed by an appointed chairman. At the national and municipal levels, these are the King and the Mayor; at the provincial level it is the King's commissioner.\n\nThe King’s Commissioner is not elected by the residents of the province, but appointed by the Dutch Crown (the ministers, presided over by the monarch), for a term of six years, renewable. The King’s Commissioner can be dismissed only by the Dutch Crown. When a vacancy arises, the provincial council gives the Minister of the Interior a profile of the kind of candidate it would like to see in the job. Although all King’s Commissioners are prominent members of one or another of the major national political parties, they are expected to be politically impartial while they are in office.\n\nThe King's Commissioners play a role within the provincial administration and are the official representatives of central government in the provinces. They coordinate disaster management and prevention and pay regular official visits to the municipalities in their region.\n\nThe King's Commissioners play an important part in the appointment of municipal mayors. When a vacancy arises, the King's Commissioner first asks the municipal council for its views as to a successor, then writes to the Minister of the Interior, recommending a candidate. Since the King's Commissioners are both the chairs and full members of the provincial executives, they may include some of the executive's tasks in their portfolio. They also oversee the official apparatus and any provincial utilities and represent the province in its dealings with business.\n\nIn the Dutch province of Limburg, the King’s Commissioner is usually informally called \"Gouverneur\" (\"governor\"), as in Belgium. Similarly, the \"Provinciehuis\" (\"Province Hall\") at Maastricht is called \"Gouvernement\" (\"Governor’s Residence\"). This local custom arose from the particular status of the province in the nineteenth century. The official name of the office is currently the same as in the other provinces.\n\n"}

Haggling is a common sight here and the place is usually crowded with locals as well as tourists.\n\nThe area has dozens of restaurants and food stalls, serving local favourites such as Hokkien mee, Ikan Bakar (barbecued fish), \"asam laksa\" and curry noodles. Reggae Bar Chinatown is located here. \nTraders here are mainly Chinese but there are also Indian, Malay, and Bangladeshi traders. It is also known for street prostitution.\n\nThe original Chinatown centred on Market Square. Jalan Tun H.S. Lee or \"High Street\". The High Street was popular as it was higher than the rest of the town and was therefore less prone to floods, and the wealthier population were inclined to build their shophouses here. As a result, the more ornate shop houses were built north of Jalan Cheng Lock, and closer to the High Street business centre.\n\nKuala Lumpur was a typical \"pioneer\" town around the start of the 20th century. The population was largely male and they were typical of the rough and tough pioneers of those times.\n\nThe men were mainly Cantonese and Hakkas who had come to the city because of the tin trade, working as coolies in the mines. They were governed by a Chinese Kapitan or headman. The most famous Chinese Kapitan was Yap Ah Loy, a Hakka.\nIn 1870, civil war erupted within the Chinese community. This was split along partisan lines between the Hokkien Ghee Hin and the Hakka Hai San secret societies. The British realising that the war is disrupting their economy and chain of supply, decided to enter the war. As a result of the long civil war, many buildings were destroyed or severely damaged.\n\nDuring this Selangor Civil War, the tin mines were abandoned. The neglect during this time caused them to become flooded. When the war was over, and when the miners returned after the war, they found that the mines were now unworkable due to flooding. Yap Ah Loy managed to persuade the miners and coolies to remain in KL and also persuaded the Malays in surrounding districts to grow rice and other garden products. He opened a Tapioca Mill in Petaling Street where the tubers from his farms were brought to be ground into flour. Petaling Street is fondly called 'Chee Cheong Kai' in Cantonese which means Starch Factory Street.\n\nThere used to be a McDonald's on the 1st shop lot of Petaling Street (facing Foch Avenue (Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock)) before it ceased operations several years ago. Nearby is a Chinese bookstore, as well as food stalls selling a variety of local food like Hainanese chicken rice and noodles. There is one famous and established Wanton Noodle shop called Koon Kee too, it's located near the intersection inside Petaling Street. Also nearby are the Jamek Mosque, an old mosque of Moorish architecture as well as the Central Market, all accessible within walking distance. One of Kuala Lumpur's famous landmarks, the Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur, is located along Jalan Tun H.S. Lee. It is one of KL's oldest and richest Hindu temples, receiving many devotees and tourists daily.\n\nIn 2003, Petaling Street underwent a major RM11 mil face lift when two large Chinese arches to welcome visitors were placed at either end of the street. A green roof cover was constructed, covering the whole street, dubbed the \"Green Dragon\". The street is now totally pedestrianised and transformed into a pedestrian shopping mall. The Street is regarded as a heritage site.\n\nPetaling Street is still the best place to shop for counterfeit branded products and for trying out its large selection of local Chinese cuisine. For buyers, it is often possible to haggle on the price of watches, clothing and all the counterfeit items. The Street is always crowded not only with tourists, but also with locals.\n\nAlthough not shot on site, Malaysia's first period kungfu comedy, Petaling Street Warriors, is set against the backdrop of Petaling Street in the year 1908.\n\nThe street is accessible within walking distance from the following rail stations:\n\n"}

R. S., F. G. S., an army surgeon, who later became well known as a scientist, a fellow of the Royal Society, and an author of natural history books set in different parts of the British Empire. Francis's mother, Bertha Jane Grundy, became a well-known novelist. After his education at Shrewsbury School he served from 1879 as an attaché in Paris, and then took up a teaching position as an assistant master at Ventnor on the Isle of Wight for two years.\n\nAdams joined the Social Democratic Federation, the first avowedly Marxist political party in the UK, in London in 1883.\n\nIn 1884 he married Helen Uttley and migrated to Australia, where he started work as a tutor on a station at Jerilderie, New South Wales, but soon moved on to Sydney and then Queensland, dedicating himself to writing.\n\nIn 1884 Adams had a volume of poems published, and also \"Henry and Other Tales\" (London) and an autobiographical novel \"Leicester, an Autobiography\" (1884). These were followed in 1886 by a collection of \"Australian Essays\" on topics such as Melbourne, Sydney and the poet Adam Lindsay Gordon. This was published in Melbourne and in London. During the Australian period he also contributed to periodicals, including \"The Bulletin\".\n\nAdams then moved to Brisbane and published \"Poetical Works\" (1886, Brisbane), a quarto volume of over 150 pages printed in double columns. His wife died giving birth to a baby boy, Leith, who also died. Adams remained in Brisbane until the early part of 1887, and published a further novel, \"Madeline Brown's Murderer\" (1887, Sydney). After a short stay in Sydney, Adams married again, returned to Brisbane, and remained there until about the end of 1889 writing leaders for the \"Brisbane Courier\". At the end of 1887, Adams published his best-known collection of verse, \"Songs of the Army of the Night\", which created a sensation in Sydney, and later went through three editions in London.\n\nHe returned to England in early 1890 and published two more novels: \"John Webb's End, a Story of Bush Life\" (1891, London), and \"The Melbournians\" (1892). A volume of short stories, \"Australian Life\", followed in 1892.\nAdams' health was failing rapidly from tuberculosis. He spent the winter of December 1892–February 1893 in Alexandria finishing a book attacking the British occupation of Egypt: \"The New Egypt\" was released after his death in 1893. His novel, \"A Child of the Age\", a reworking of \"Leicester, an Autobiography\", was brought out posthumously in 1894 by John Lane as the fourth book in its Keynote Series. It describes vividly the schooldays (at \"Glastonbury\") and poverty-stricken struggles of a would-be poet and scholar, Bertram Leicester, in a way understandably suffused with a \"fin-de-siècle\" melancholy. Other posthumous publications were \"Tiberius\" – a striking drama with an introduction by William Michael Rossetti, presenting a new view of the Emperor's character, and finally, \"Essays in Modernity\" in 1899.\n\nAdams shot himself dead at a boarding house in Margate, England, during a severe tubucular haemorrhage that would probably have been fatal in any case. He had long carried a pistol for this purpose. He was survived by his second wife, Edith (née Goldstone), who assisted his suicide but was not convicted of any crime. As a self-professed \"child of his age\", Adams combined in his life and work many distinctive features of \"fin de siècle\" British culture and Australian radical nationalism in the 1890s, including a strong sympathy with socialist and feminist movements.\n\nAdams's energy and drive can be seen in his large written output over a short lifetime. He often wrote quickly and did little revision, living as he did on income from writing. \"Songs of the Army of the Night\" has been reprinted in many editions, but the reputation of these poems derives from their engagement with social issues, rather than their poetic value. Adams displayed a deep sympathy with downtrodden races and men. \n\nAs an activist in the Social Democratic Federation the rhetoric of \"At the West India Docks\" where London dock labourers were working for fourpence an hour, resonated in the labour movement. Some of his verse provoked resentment in Conservative circles, but Adams was part of a rapidly growing political working class movement fired by poverty and exploitation in Britain.\n\nAs a writer of novels Adams connected with contemporary social issues. Although his work could be hasty and uneven, it is interesting for its treatment of themes such as the portrayal of women in Australia, of nationalism. For example, \"The Melbournians\", is a society romance featuring a central female character and a democratically minded Australian journalist.\n\nAdams had not intended to be a journalist, but once in Australia Adams took to the work quickly and was highly regarded by colleagues in Sydney and Brisbane He was an astute, if sometimes impetuous, critic of literature and of his social and political milieux.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Similarly, the \"Provinciehuis\" (Province Hall) in Maastricht is called \"Gouvernement\" (Governor's Residence). This local custom arose from the particular status of the current province in the nineteenth century.\n\nIn 1830, the whole of the province of Limburg, which at the time consisted of both the present Dutch and Belgian parts, joined in the Belgian Revolution, with the notable exception of the city of Maastricht. From then until 1839 Limburg was governed as part of Belgium. As per the 1839 Treaty of London, The Netherlands recognized Belgium's independence, but special provisions were made for Limburg (and Luxembourg). The province was divided into two, roughly taking river Meuse as the border, with most of the eastern half, although now an integral part of the Dutch territory, becoming a member of the German Confederacy as the \"Duchy of Limburg\" to appease Prussia, which had lost access to the Meuse after the Congress of Vienna. This peculiar arrangement, which excluded Maastricht and Venlo, lasted until the Confederation's dissolution in 1866.\n\nThe folklore custom to call the local King's Commissioner \"Governor\" dates from these times, and nowadays is used to underline the Limburgers' (self-)perceived otherness from \"regular\" Dutchmen.\n"}

The bottle was modeled after a globus cruciger.\n\nIn the U.S. market, the manufacturer began using a different bottle design in summer 2010, with modifications to the belt, lid and other elements.\n\nIn addition to redesigning the bottle for the traditional Chambord liqueur, the manufacturer has also begun using the Chambord brand name on a flavoured vodka.\n\nCommon drinks made from Chambord include the Raspberry Margarita, French Manhattan, Rolling Green (cocktail) [vodka, lemonade] Butler Miller (Chambord Vodka Gimlet), Kir Impérial (Chambord and champagne), Chambord Daiquiri, Chambord Royal Spritzer, Lemonado (Vodka, lemonade and splash of Chambord), Little Purple Men, The Purple Hooter Shooter, Sour Grapes, Black Opal, Peanut Butter and Jelly (with Frangelico or Castries Peanut Cream), Grape Crush, the \"Blood of Christ\", Grateful Dead, and the French Martini. The French Martini started the \"cocktails as a Martini\" craze.\n\nSince 2007, Chambord has earned silver and bronze medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Other spirit ratings organizations have rated Chambord relatively highly as well. Based on Chambord's reviews from various professional raters, Proof66 has categorized Chambord as a \"First Tier\" liqueur.\n\n"}

As a football player he would spend his entire professional football career playing for Shandong Luneng, while internationally he would be a participant of the 2000 AFC Asian Cup, 2002 FIFA World Cup and 2004 AFC Asian Cup.\n\nLi Xiaopeng was a highly promising young player who was playing for the Shandong Luneng youth team before graduating to senior team during the 1994 league season, however it was not until the following season when he played in seventeen league games and score four goals did he start to show his prominence. While he remained a consistent squad regular within the team for the next few seasons it was not until Slobodan Santrač became manager of the team at the beginning of the 1999 league season did Li Xiaopeng really start to become a vital member within the midfield when he aided the team to a league and cup double at the end of the season. Well regarded in China for his good ball-control and vision in passing within the team he would aid Shandong to win another Chinese FA Cup and Chinese Super League cup in 2004. This saw Shandong have another chance to play in the rebranded AFC Champions League where despite being a defensive midfielder he would score a stylish first goal for Shandong Luneng with a lob from 40 meters during an ACL game in 2005 in the 7–2 second leg loss against Al-Ittihad (Jeddah), which was to be one of his last achievement before he retired in 2006.\n\nWhile Li Xiaopeng was part of the squad that won the AFC U-17 Championship in 1992 he would have to wait until 3 September 2000 before he made his senior international debut in a friendly against Iraq in 4–1 victory. This would be impressive enough for him to be included in the squad for 2000 AFC Asian Cup where despite playing a small role within the tournament he nevertheless saw China finish fourth. After the tournament he would start to form a successful partnership with Li Tie in midfield that saw China qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, which saw him score his debut goal United Arab Emirates in a 3–0 victory during qualifying. While China's debut in the World Cup was not successful Li Xiaopeng still retained his place within the team until the 2004 AFC Asian Cup which saw the emergence of Zhao Junzhe as his replacement.\n\nAfter he retired Shandong offered him a position as the boss of media presentation, however due to his high profile within China he was linked to numerous management positions. He would eventually go on to achieve the necessary coaching certificates required for a management position and he was expected to become an assistant within the Chinese Football Association. On 8 August 2010 he would accept the position of interim head coach for the Chinese women's team up to the 2010 Asian Games, which made him the youngest coach to ever manage the team. At the Football at the 2010 Asian Games Li would guide the team to the semi-finals where they lost 1–0 to Japan's women team. This would be good enough for Li to be offered an extension to his contract and Li was given the job to guide the China's women team through the 2012 Summer Olympics qualifiers, however the team failed to make it to the tournament and Li resigned as coach.\n\nChina U-17\n\nShandong Luneng\n\n"}

He currently holds 16 world titles, more than any other gymnast in China. On 29 August 2009, he was the torch bearer for the torch relay of the East Asian Games in Hong Kong. He retired from the sport in late 2009.\n\nHe began gymnastics training at Changsha Spare-time Sports School in Hunan Province at the age of 6 and was a member of the Hunan provincial team at 12. Li's diligence and skill soon set him apart from his peers, which could be proved by his several provincial titles. At the age of 15, he was selected into the national team.\n\nAt 16, Li Xiaopeng became China's youngest world (team) gymnastics champion ever when he and his teammates won the men's team final at the 1997 Lausanne World Championships. At the same event, Li also received a silver medal for parallel bars, just second to his teammate Zhang Jingjin, and a bronze for floor exercise.\n\nAt the 1999 Tianjin World Championships, Li was part of the Chinese team to become men's team champion. Individually, he won his first gold medal in vault. However, his failure in parallel bars left something to be desired, which pushed him to train harder for the Sydney Olympics.\n\nAt the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, Li and his teammates gave an outstanding performance, earning them the gold medal at the prestigious men's team event, a first for Chinese gymnasts. Li also won an individual gold medal in parallel bars.\n\nAt the 2003 Anaheim World Championships, Li Xiaopeng was the only person to win three gold medals, namely for men's team final, vault and parallel bars. Thus he was voted as the 2003 World Gymnast of the Year.\n\nHowever, due to a severe foot injury, Li's performance at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games was unsatisfactory. China finished 5th at the men's team final, and Li could only get a bronze in parallel bars, after being undefeated in major competitions since 2000. He was the fourth athlete to compete in the vault event finals, but unfortunately shuffled during the initial sprint and fell on the first jump.\n\nLi had been suffering from a chronic ankle injury and had an operation in 2005. He rested for that whole year, refraining from participating in any competitions.\n\nIn 2006, he made a successful comeback by winning a gold in parallel bars at the São Paulo World Cup Series Final. By then he had tied with his idol, China's gymnastic legend Li Ning, by winning a record of 14 world titles.\n\nIn 2008, after suffering from toe injury, he came back and won titles for parallel bars at the two gymnastics World Cups, Cottbus and Tianjin.\n\nAfter winning two gold medals for men's team and parallel bars at the Beijing Olympics, he surpassed Li Ning by holding 16 world titles, more than any other gymnasts in China. He retired in late 2009.\n\nThe Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique has named two routines after Li. They are \"Li Xiaopeng hop\" in vault, and \"Li Xiaopeng arm hang\" in parallel bars.\n\nHe met his wife, a Chinese-American girl Li \"Angel\" Anqi daughter of former gymnasts Li Xiaoping and Wen Jia at the 2003 World Championship in Anaheim, California where her father served as a host and interpreter for the Chinese team. They became engaged in 2008, and married in LA on June 5, 2010. The couple held a second marriage ceremony in Beijing on July 11, 2010. Due to a problem with the visa of Li's parents, they were unable to attend the LA wedding ceremony. On January 12, 2012, they had their first child named Olivia (Li Xinqi). His second child, a son, named Max was born in June 2016.\n\nLi Xiaopeng and his daughter have been regular cast members on the show \"Dad came back\" (a version of Korean reality-variety show \"Return of Superman\") on which dads have to take care of their child/children without help of anyone (including their wives) in 48 hours. After the first season was aired, his daughter gained a lot of love from public and fans. He also appeared on other television shows such as the first season of \"The Amazing Race China\" and the 2016 \"Race the World\" (), which he had to quit before the finale due to the expected birth of his second child.\n\n"}
{"id": "1825295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825295", "title": "Aunt Bee", "text": "Aunt Bee\n\nAunt Bee is a fictional character from the 1960 American television sitcom \"The Andy Griffith Show\". Played by Frances Bavier, the character migrated to the spinoff \"Mayberry R.F.D.\" (1968–1971) when \"The Andy Griffith Show\" ended its run in 1968, and remained for two years. Though she was the aunt of Sheriff Andy Taylor, virtually every character in Mayberry called her \"Aunt Bee\".\n\nAunt Bee, full name Beatrice Taylor, is the paternal aunt of widower Sheriff Andy Taylor and great-aunt to his son Opie Taylor. In the premiere episode of \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"The New Housekeeper,\" Aunt Bee returns to Mayberry after a five-year sojourn in Morgantown, West Virginia, when Andy's housekeeper Rose marries and leaves his house. Aunt Bee thereafter manages Andy's household and becomes Opie's surrogate mother and grandmother. Andy explains to Opie that he was raised by Aunt Bee, and Bee later mentions, without elaboration, having raised other Taylors. Bee is well known in Mayberry for her cooking skills. In the first episode, she serves a platter of fried chicken with all the trimmings, and thereafter her character is associated with wholesome, home-cooked meals. She frequently contributes meals to community or church events and brings picnic baskets of food to Mayberry's tiny jail for its lawmen and inmates. While Aunt Bee is celebrated for her cuisine, she falls short as a pickler and marmalade maker. Andy and Barney refer to her pickles as \"kerosene cucumbers\" and her marmalade as \"ammonia\". Andy is fond of her pork chops and cornbread biscuits, while Opie's favorite dish is her butterscotch pecan pie. Bee has several one-episode flirtations in the early seasons with men who prove to be cads.\n\nAunt Bee's other relatives sometimes come up in episodes; she speaks of trimming her brother's hair when a girl and, in one episode, her sister Nora visits. She also has a rapscallion cousin called Bradford J. Taylor who features in a color episode. Bee is a teetotaler. In an episode in which a traveling salesman comes to Mayberry peddling patent medicine, Andy tells Barney that Aunt Bee is heavily against alcohol due to her brother's trouble with the bottle. In the same episode, Bee plays the piano and speaks of her baptism. Bee is a member of the town choir and sings in church.\n\nBee undergoes some changes during the final three color years of \"The Andy Griffith Show.\" In the early years, she gives her heart to scalawags of all sorts and sometimes needs Andy's help in extricating herself from unpleasant romantic situations. In the color years, however, Bee's suitors are respectable gentlemen and include a retired congressman, a clergyman, and a distinguished professor. Bee's evolution in personality is reflected in her dress. In the show's early years, she is given to wearing comically dowdy house dresses, fruit- and flower-decorated hats, and ladylike white gloves for venturing outside the house. In the color episodes, she discards her frumpy wardrobe and steps into more stylish attire.\n\nMore drastic in the evolution of the character than her taste-shift in men and her wardrobe about-face is her liberation from her homemaker role in Andy's house. In the later episodes, Bee leaves the Taylor kitchen to open her own restaurant, to host a television cooking show, to run for office, to buy a car, and to take flying lessons. Andy and Opie are sometimes left at home to prepare their own meals. In spite of her sudden spirit of independence, Bee never quite makes a complete break and continues to rely on Andy to direct the course of her life and make the difficult decisions.\n\nAunt Bee sees Opie grow from age 6 to 14. When Andy marries his longtime girlfriend Helen Crump on the spinoff \"Mayberry R.F.D.,\" she opts to give the newlyweds their own space and becomes housekeeper for farmer Sam Jones (another widowed father) and his young son Mike. Residing at the Jones farm, Aunt Bee feeds the livestock and gathers eggs. The following year Andy and Helen move to Raleigh.\n\nIn 1986, a made-for-television reunion movie called \"Return to Mayberry\" was broadcast on NBC. Although many original cast members reprised their roles, Aunt Bee's portrayer, film veteran character actress and 1967 Emmy winner Frances Bavier, had retired to Siler City, North Carolina (where she died in 1989 and is buried), was in ill health, and declined to participate. In the television movie, it is revealed that Bee died before the events of the film, and Andy Taylor is seen reverentially visiting Aunt Bee's grave.\n\nBeginning with the second season, Aunt Bee had at least one flirtation (rarely, if ever, amounting to a true romance) per season. These flirtations added significant depth and interest to her character. In the black-and-white seasons, Bee threatened to give her heart to cads of all sorts and sometimes needed Andy's help in extricating herself from unpleasant situations. In the color years, however, Bee gained wisdom through experience. She paired herself with respectable gentlemen and managed her affairs without significant assistance from Andy. Of course there was never an implication of physical involvement. In spite of Aunt Bee's propensity for affairs of the heart and her active pursuit of elderly bachelors, she was only engaged once—to a cruise-ship captain (played by Will Geer for two episodes) during season one of \"Mayberry RFD.\"\n\n\n\nAunt Bee's closest friend in Mayberry is widow Clara Edwards (Hope Summers). Although Clara is a well-meaning woman, she often proves irksome when positioning herself as Bee's rival for the attentions of the single, older gentlemen passing through Mayberry. She vies with Bee in cooking contests and flower shows and replaces her in the town pageant when Bee realizes she has no talent for theatricals. Clara and Bee attended school together as girls, even playing on the same basketball team. They compose an anthem celebrating the good life in Mayberry and, in one episode, vacation in Mexico with their friend Myrtle. Clara is sometimes a petty and jealous woman, often ruining Bee's pleasure in one small thing or another with a dismissive sniff or an abrupt and cutting comment.\n\n"}

He is best remembered as the author of a nine-volume Polish-language history of Lithuania from the early Middle Ages to the Union of Lublin.\n\nTeodor Narbutt was born in 1784 in the village of Szawry (present-day Voranava District of Belarus) in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, to a notable szlachta family of Trąby coat of arms. Early in his youth his fatherland was partitioned between Russia, Austria and Prussia. After graduating from a Piarist college at Lyubeshiv, Narbutt entered the Vilna Academy, where in 1803 he graduated in engineering. He then moved to Saint Petersburg, where he joined the Cadet Corps. He served in the Imperial Russian Army, where he became a captain in the field engineering corps. He took part in the 1807 and 1812 Russian campaigns against Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1809 he constructed the Bobruysk fortress (modern Babruysk, Belarus), for which he was awarded the Order of Saint Anna.\n\nAt the same time, since 1813 he became interested in archaeology and started to organize numerous excavations across the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His passion for history, culture and folklore of the lands of former Grand Duchy was first shown after 1817, at which date he started to write historical articles for various Vilna-based newspapers. He also started to collect copies of documents related to the ancient history of Lithuania, which were published in 1846 in an anthology \"Pomniki do dziejów litewskich\" (\"Monuments of Lithuanian History\"). Among the most notable primary sources he published was the 16th-century (?) \"Letopis of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania\", also known as the \"Bychowiec Chronicle\", after its founder Aleksander Bychowiec.\nBetween 1835 and 1841 he published a monumental, 9-volume history of Lithuania, covering the period from the prehistoric times to the Union of Lublin. Although largely based on folk tales, dubious and often falsified sources, the book had a tremendous impact on both historiography of Lithuania, and later on Lithuanian National Revival. Its Lithuanian translation became the first history of Lithuania written entirely from a Lithuanian perspective. Paradoxically, the book underlined the Ruthenian past of Lithuania, and as such was highly acclaimed by Russian historians and authorities alike. For it, Narbutt was awarded by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia a gold ring set with a ruby, the Order of Saint Anne and the Order of Saint Vladimir. In 1856, Narbutt published yet another collection of texts, comprising original primary sources and his own forgeries. Among the most popular of the latter was \"von Kyburg's Diary\", a fabricated account of Lithuania in the 13th century.\n\nThroughout his life, Narbutt remained an active member of the Archaeological Commission of Vilna, as well as a notable engineer. Between 1847 and 1852 he constructed a parish church in Eišiškės (Ejszyszki in Polish), now Lithuania. Although loyal to Imperial Russia, the anti-Russian January Uprising brought an end to his family. His wife, Krystyna Narbutt \"née\" Sadowska was sentenced to forced resettlement to Siberia and was not allowed to return until 1871. His older son, Ludwik Narbutt, became a notable commander of the Polish forces in the area of Lida and was killed in 1863 in fight against the Russians. The younger son Bolesław was sentenced to death by the Russian authorities, but his sentence was later changed to life imprisonment because of his young age. Narbutt's only daughter Teodora had to flee the country and was sentenced to forced labour \"in absentia\". Narbutt himself died in 1864 in Vilnius.\n\nNarbutt had no education in history and is infamous for his uncritical, amateurish approach to historical sources. In the absence of written sources, he often used dubious sources and his own imagination. Some historians believe him to be of good intentions if naive, while others accuse him of actively creating forgeries. In particular, historians identified these sources, discovered and published by Narbutt, as possible forgeries:\n\n\nAt least one of his published sources earlier suspected to be a forgery, namely the \"Bychowiec Chronicle\", was conclusively proven to be authentic and a highly valuable historical source.\n\nNarbutt's nine-volume history of Lithuania (1835–1841) is the first work to separate the history of Lithuania from that of Poland. The work ends with the Union of Lublin (1569) and the death of King Sigismund Augustus (1572), because Narbutt believed that Lithuanian history ended with the formation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Augustus, the last ruler of the Gediminian-Jagiellonian dynasty. There are a number of historical inaccuracies in his books, for example, Narbutt propagated the legend of Lithuanian lineage from the Romans (see: Palemonids). Narbutt was preparing a corrected second edition at the time of his death, only the summary of the Lithuanian history was published: \"Dzieje narodu litewskiego w krótkości zebrane\" (1847). \n\nBoth of these studies are critically regarded by historians because of historical inaccuracies, but Lithuanians in the 19th century, during an era of the rising national consciousness, welcomed every opportunity to derive patriotic inspiration from the past. Narbutt maintained contact with the leading Lithuanian activists of his day and corresponded extensively with Simonas Daukantas, who in the same romantic spirit wrote the first Lithuanian-language history of Lithuania.\n\nHis lack of critical judgement in differentiating between the authentic and spurious sources lessened the value of his work today, but his contributions remain very important to the Lithuanian history. Narbutt revealed many unknown historical sources, the most famous being the Bychowiec Chronicle. It is the most comprehensive version of the Lithuanian chronicles, compiled from manuscripts dating from the first half of the 16th century. He has also collected and made copies of many original manuscripts, which have provided sources for historical studies later.\n\n\n"}

It was Tornatore's first English-language film. The film is inspired by \"Novecento\", a monologue by Alessandro Baricco. The film was nominated for a variety of awards worldwide, winning several for its soundtrack.\n\nThe story is told \"in medias res\" as a series of flashbacks. Max Tooney, a musician, enters a secondhand music shop just before closing time, broke and badly in need of money. He has only a Conn trumpet, which he sells for less than he had hoped. Clearly torn at parting from his prized possession, he asks to play it one last time. The shopkeeper agrees, and as the musician plays, the shopkeeper immediately recognizes the song from a broken record matrix (master disc) he found inside a recently acquired secondhand piano. He asks who the piece is by, and Max tells him the story of 1900.\n\n1900 was found abandoned on the four stacker ocean liner SS \"Virginian\", a baby in a box, and likely the son of poor immigrants from steerage. Danny, a coal-man from the boiler room, is determined to raise the boy as his own. He names the boy Danny Boodman T. D. Lemon 1900 (a combination of his own name, an advertisement found on the box and the year he was born) and hides him from the ship's officers. A few years later Danny is killed in a workplace accident, and 1900 is forced to survive aboard the \"Virginian\" as an orphan. For many years, he travels back and forth across the Atlantic, keeping a low profile.\n\nThe boy shows a particular gift for music and eventually grows up and joins the ship's orchestra. He befriends Max in 1927, but never leaves the vessel. Apparently, the outside world is too \"big\" for his imagination at this point. But he stays current with outside musical trends as passengers explain to him a new music trend or style, and he immediately picks it up and starts playing it for them.\n\nHis reputation as a pianist is so renowned that Jelly Roll Morton, of New Orleans jazz fame, on hearing of 1900's skill comes aboard to challenge him to a piano duel. After hearing Jelly Roll Morton's first tune, 1900 plays a piece so simple and well known (\"Silent Night\") that the self-proclaimed inventor of jazz feels mocked. As Morton becomes more determined to display his talent, he plays an impressive tune (\"The Crave\") that brings tears to 1900's eyes. 1900 calmly sits down at the piano and plays from memory the entire tune that Morton had just played. 1900's playing fails to impress the crowd until he plays an original piece (\"Enduring Movement\") of such virtuosity and superhuman speed that the metal piano strings become hot enough for 1900 to light a cigarette. He hands it to Morton, who has lost the duel.\n\nA record producer, having heard of 1900's prowess, brings a primitive recording apparatus aboard and cuts a demo record of a 1900 original composition. The recorded music is created by 1900 as he gazes at a woman (The Girl) who has just boarded and whom he finds attractive. When 1900 hears the recording, he takes the master disc, offended at the prospect of anyone hearing the music without his having performed it live. He then tries to give the master to The Girl who inspired it, but is unable to and breaks the matrix into pieces.\n\nThe story flashes back to the mid-1940s periodically, as we see Max (who leaves the ship's orchestra in 1933) trying to lure 1900 out of the now-deserted hull of the ship. Having served as a hospital ship and transport in World War II, she is scheduled to be scuttled and sunk far offshore. Max manages to get aboard the ship with the recording 1900 made long ago and plays it, hoping to attract 1900's attention. When it does, Max attempts to convince 1900 to leave the ship. But he is too daunted by the size of the world. Feeling that his fate is tied to the ship, 1900 cannot bring himself to leave the only home he has known. Max feels useless that he couldn't save his friend.\n\nThe shopkeeper asks Max how the record got into the secondhand piano. Max indicates that he put it there, and the shopkeeper tells him that he wasn't so useless after all. Then, as Max is leaving the store, the shopkeeper gives him the trumpet and says, \"A good story is worth more than an old trumpet,\" and Max walks out as another customer walks in.\n\n\"The Legend of 1900\" received mixed critical reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 54% based on 41 reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a 58/100 rating based on 28 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". On 15 November 2019 the film was given a wide release in China and made 130 million yuan (the equivalent of about $18.4 million) in its first two weeks.\n\n"}

There is a wide selection of emblems, pictures, and words that can be added to the sides of the rings and even inside the center gem.\n\nThe tradition of class rings originated with the class of 1835 at the United States Military Academy at West Point.\n\nThe \"Complete Book of Etiquette\" by Amy Vanderbilt indicates the following protocol for wearing of a class ring. For as long as the wearer is in school, the insignia should face the wearer to remind him/her of the goal of graduation. Upon graduation, the class ring gains the status of a \"badge of honor\" similar to a diploma, with the effect that graduation entitles the wearer to display the insignia facing outward so that it faces other viewers. An additional justification for this practice is the rationale that the ring also symbolizes the graduate themself: During the wearer's time in school, they focus on self-development and goals specific to the insular academic environment; upon graduation, the wearer enters the wider world and puts what they have learned to work in shaping it.\n\nA notable exception to this protocol is the custom followed by older graduating classes of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Today, as in years past, Academy graduates frequently wear their rings on the left hand in observance of the ancient belief, which also underlay the Anglo-American custom of wearing wedding bands on the left hand, that a vein connects the left ring finger to the heart. Prior to graduation, these classes wore the USMA Class Ring with the Class Crest closest to the heart, signifying a given cadet's bond to his class within the Academy. Following graduation, members of these classes wore (and, for surviving members, still wear) the ring with the Academy Crest closest to the heart, signifying their bond with the Academy as a whole.\n\nAt the United States Military Academy, United States Naval Academy, United States Air Force Academy, The Citadel, and the United States Coast Guard Academy each cadet's class ring contains melted gold from rings donated to the respective school from deceased alumni.\n\n\"The Lords of Discipline\". \"I wear the ring.

{"id": "1825327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825327", "title": "Katima Mulilo", "text": "Katima Mulilo\n\nKatima Mulilo is a town situated in the Caprivi strip and is the capital of the Zambezi Region, Namibia's far northeast extension into central Southern Africa. It comprises two electoral constituencies, Katima Mulilo Rural and Katima Mulilo Urban. Katima Mulilo, which is sometimes shortened to just \"Katima\", had 28,362 inhabitants in 2010,\nIt is located on the national road B8 on the banks of the Zambezi River in lush riverine vegetation with tropical birds and monkeys. The town receives an annual average rainfall of .\n\nThe nearest Namibian town to Katima Mulilo is Rundu, about 500 km away. About 40 km east of Katima Mulilo lies the village of Bukalo, where the road to Ngoma branches off that joins Namibia to Botswana.\n\nThe name comes from the SiLozi for \"quench the fire\", referring to nearby rapids in the Zambezi). From early days (and before the advent of fire-lighting matches), there was river transport by barge (propelled by paddlers) along the Zambesi from Livingstone to Sesheke, on past the Ngonye Falls at Sioma, where an attempt was made in about 1905 to bypass the Falls with a canal. Barges were unloaded and dragged by oxen round the Falls. The route continued to Mongu, the administrative capital of Barotseland, and on Northwards to the settlement of Balovale (now Zambesi) in the North West of Zambia, at . When the barge reached Katima Mulilo, the fire was extinguished (but embers kept), and the barge was unloaded and then dragged empty up the rapids, and re-loaded before continuing the journey - but not before the fire was re-lit.\n\nOn 28 January 1935, the administrative centre of the Caprivi Strip was moved from Schuckmannsburg to Katima Mulilo. This date is assumed as the foundation date of Katima Mulilo. The regional office, the only brick-and-mortar building at Katima Mulilo at this time when the area consisted exclusively of pristine forests, was built under a giant Baobab situated near today's SWAPO Party regional offices. In present times the tree is known as the \"Toilet Tree\" because of a rest room carved into it.\n\nKatima Mulilo was very sparsely populated at that time. It had a missionary school run by the Seventh-day Adventists, and the small settlements were connected only by sleigh tracks. Without any roads nor other infrastructure it was difficult to administer the Caprivi Strip from here. The South African administration therefore decided to shift the regional office again, this time to Pretoria, in 1939. Given its proximity to important transport routes, particularly the railway bridge at Victoria Falls, the location of Katima Mulilo became strategically important in the Second World War which broke out soon afterwards. All military supplies, people, and goods had to be flown in. The town's first car came in 1940 and belonged to the air strip operator.\n\nIn 1940, William \"Bill\" Finaughty established the first shop in the Caprivi Strip in Katima Mulilo; the settlement that surrounded the shop was subsequently named after him. In the 1950s transport on the Zambezi River was established and allowed connection to the train service at Livingstone. The M'pacha Airfield, today Katima Mulilo Airport, was constructed in 1965 at a cost of 65 million Rand, an astronomical amount at that time when 2 Rand roughly equalled 1 Pound sterling. A police station was erected in 1961.\n\nKatima Mulilo became a segregated town in 1965 when the erection of the \"Nghweeze\" township began. The South African administration was unhappy with the \"Mafulo\" informal settlement where members of the Caprivi African National Union (CANU) were staying and conducting political activism. As a response to this development, Nghweeze (derived from totela language:which literally means \"stab me\") township was established to enable some degree of control over Blacks by only allowing local workers and their families to take up residence. At the same time the central parts of Katima Mulilo were declared the \"Katima Mulilo Proper\" residential area and restricted to Whites. Contract workers from the company \"Lewis Construction\" from Salisbury (today's Harare) in Southern Rhodesia (today's Zimbabwe) that built Nghweeze camped in an area that for this heritage is named the \"Lewis\" informal settlement. The town had only 575 inhabitants at that time but grew to over 5,000 by 1978.\n\nIn 1971 the area around Katima Mulilo got involved in the South African Border War. As in World War II, it was a strategically important location, this time due to troop transports into and out of Zambia and Angola.\n\nThe settlement also was at the centre of the Caprivi conflict in the 1990s, an armed conflict between the Caprivi Liberation Army (CLA), a rebel group working for the secession of the Caprivi Strip, and the Namibian government. In the early hours of 2 August 1999, CLA launched an attack occupying the state-run radio station and attacking a police station, the Wanella border post, and an army base. A state of emergency was declared in the province, and the government arrested alleged CLA supporters.\n\nThe oldest suburbs are Nghweeze, the former Blacks' township, and Katima Mulilo Proper, the area restricted to Whites during the apartheid era. Butterfly, Cowboy, Choto and Mahohoma are registered informal settlements of Katima, further parts of town are named Nambweza, Soweto (South–Western Townships, a reminiscence of the famous suburb of Johannesburg), New Look, Mabuluma, Lyambai, Bebi, Greenwell Matongo, Macaravan East and West, and NHE (from National Housing Enterprises, a governmental low-cost housing company that drew development here).\n\nKatima Mulilo is inhabited by members of the \"Masubia\" and \"Mafwe\" tribes. The town's coat of arms, still very similar to that used by the Caprivi government, depicts these tribes as two elephants facing each other, symbolising unity and peaceful coexistence of the two tribal chiefs.\n\nEstablished and run as a garrison for a long time, Katima Mulilo still shows signs of its military role today. In the city centre was the South African Defence Force military base, almost every house had a bomb shelter. The town benefited from the military presence in terms of infrastructure and employment, and there are still a number of military bases surrounding the town.\n\nSince the opening of the Katima Mulilo Bridge in 2004 that spans the Zambezi River and connects the Zambian Copperbelt with the Namibian deep sea harbour at Walvis Bay, Katima Mulilo has become a boom town that attracts significant investment. This development has, however, also fanned illegal business activities, and driven the establishment of shanty towns to an extent that endangers social stability.\n\nThe town features an Export Processing Zone and the largest open market in Namibia. There is an important international electricity inter–link facility, the \"Caprivi Link Inter–Connector\"; its inauguration has improved the power supply to the town. The \"Zambezi Waterfront Tourism\" project is under construction. The Caprivi Vision, a newspaper from and for the Caprivi, is published in town.\n\nSince being proclaimed a town on 2 October 1999, development has been steady but Katima Mulilo does not yet compare to more established towns and cities in Namibia. Few streets are tarred, and there is a lack of street lights and sewerage. Many residents use the bushes for lack of toilet facilities, and there have been many outbreaks of diseases such as diarrhea.\n\nThe town has been affected by corruption, financial mismanagement, and infighting between councillors ever since SWAPO took the majority on town council in 1998. Water supply has been unstable because money is owed to the national water supplier, NamWater.\n\nKatima Mulilo is the terminal town of the Trans–Caprivi Highway, and the highway together with its extension to Zambia is called the Trans-Caprivi Corridor. The Trans–Caprivi Highway was opened in 1999, and the bridge to Sesheke, and with it the entire Trans-Caprivi Corridor, in 2004.\n\nKatima Mulilo is not yet connected to the Namibian railway network. In October 2007, a proposal was announced for a railway connection between Namibia and Zambia which would pass through the town. The line would join Grootfontein to Katima Mulilo then 130 km to Mulobezi with an 80 km upgrade of the line to Livingstone.\n\nThe town is served by Katima Mulilo Airport, situated about 18 km to the southwest which is serviced by regular flights from the capital Windhoek.\n\nKatima Mulilo is governed by a town council that has seven seats.\n\nZambezi Region, whose administrative capital Katima Mulilo is, is a stronghold of Namibia's ruling SWAPO party. It won the 2010 local authority election with 2,197 votes, followed by the Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) with 473 votes. SWAPO also won the 2015 local authority election by a landslide, gaining six seats and 1,875 votes. The remaining seat went to the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) which gained 163 votes.\n\nBefore Katima Mulilo was officially founded missionaries already ran schools in the area. The Seventh–day Adventists operated one, as did the Capuchin Order. Today there are a number of schools in Katima Mulilo such as Katima High School, Caprivi Secondary School, Kizito Secondary School, Ngweze Secondary School, Mavuluma Secondary School and many primary and junior secondary schools.\n\nKatima Mulilo has two institutes of tertiary education, the Zambezi Vocational Center and a campus of the University of Namibia (UNAM) for teacher training, formerly the Caprivi College of Education (CCE). At the time of the merger with UNAM, CCE had 400 enrolled students and 70 staff.\n\nThe town houses the community-based Caprivi Art Centre and holds an annual Caprivi Cultural Festival.\n\n\n"}

It is located at 2350 McGregor Boulevard, Fort Myers, Florida.\n\nOn April 18, 2012, the American Institute of Architects' Florida Chapter placed the Edison and Ford Winter Estates on its list of \"Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places\".\nThe American Chemical Society recognized the Edison Botanical Research Laboratory at the Edison & Ford Winter Estates as a National Historic Chemical Landmark on May 25, 2014.\n\nThe present site dates from 1885, when Edison first visited southwest Florida and purchased the property to build a vacation home. His home, completed in 1886 and later dubbed \"Seminole Lodge\", served as a winter retreat and place of relaxation until Edison's death in 1931. Edison's good friend Henry Ford purchased the adjoining property, \"The Mangoes\" from Robert Smith of New York in 1916. Ford's craftsman style bungalow was built in 1911 by Smith. In 1947, Mrs. Mina Edison deeded the Edison property to the City of Fort Myers in memory of her husband for the enjoyment of the public. It was opened for public tours soon after.\n\nIn 1988, the adjacent Henry Ford winter estate was purchased and opened for public tours in 1990. In 2003, the governance of the site was transferred from the City to a new non-profit corporation, Thomas Edison & Henry Ford Winter Estates, Inc. (dba Edison & Ford Winter Estates, Inc.) whose mission is to protect, preserve and interpret the site. The new corporation successfully completed a $14 million restoration project in the following years. A separate fundraising arm, Edison-Ford Winter Estates Foundation, Inc. was created to assist the restoration project with no function in governance, programming or development but rather to assist the governing board with the initial restoration.\n\nEdison's botanical garden contains more than a thousand varieties of plants from around the world, including African Sausage Trees and a banyan tree planted in the mid-1920s.\nThe gardens feature plants grown for industrial purposes (such as bamboo, used in light bulb filaments) and those which Mina Edison planted for their beauty, including roses, orchids and bromeliads. The Moonlight garden was designed by Ellen Biddle Shipman.\n\nBefore Hurricane Irma the collection included: \"Acalypha hispida\", \"Arenga pinnata\", \"Artocarpus heterophyllus\", \"Billbergia spp.\", \"Blighia sapida\", \"Bougainvillea glabra\", \"Bougainvillea spectabilis\", \"Calliandra haematocephala\", \"Cananga odorata\", \"Cattleya\" hybrid, \"Cattleya\" spp., \"Chorisia speciosa\", \"Citrus spp.\", \"Clerodendrum speciosissimum\", \"Cordyline terminalis\", \"Cycad spp.\", \"Dendrobium\", \"Dombeya spp.\", \"Epidendrum ciliare\", \"Ficus auriculata\", \"Ficus benghalensis\", \"Ficus saussureana\", \"Hibiscus schizopetalus\", \"Holmskioldia sanguinea\", \"Ibosa riparia\", \"Ixora chinensis\", \"Kigelia africana\", \"Leea coccinea\", \"Malvaviscus arboreus\", \"Musa spp.\", \"Parmentiera cereifera\", \"Plumbago auriculata\", \"Solandra nitida\", \"Spathoglottis plicata\", \"Tabernaemontana corymbosa\", \"Tecoma stans\", \"Thunbergia erecta\", \"Tibouchina semidecandra\", and hundreds more.\n\nDuring the period of 1914–1918 (World War I), Edison became concerned with America's reliance on foreign supplies of rubber. He partnered with Harvey Firestone and Henry Ford to try to find a rubber tree or plant that could grow quickly in the United States and provide a domestic supply of rubber. In 1927, the three men contributed $25,000 each and created the Edison Botanic Research Corporation in an attempt to find a solution to this problem. In 1928, the Edison Botanic Research Corporation laboratory was constructed. It was in Fort Myers, Florida that Mr. Edison would do the majority of his research and planting of his exotic plants and trees.\n\nAfter testing over 17,000 plant samples, Edison eventually discovered a source in the plant goldenrod (\"Solidago leavenworthii\"). Thomas Edison died in 1931 and the rubber project was transferred to the United States Department of Agriculture five years later.\n\nVisitors to the Edison and Ford Winter Estates in Fort Myers can view more than of historical buildings and gardens including the 1928 Botanical Laboratory and the Edison Ford Museum. There are also a variety of programs, tours and activities.\n\nEdison Ford also offers school and education tours for all ages, an extensive summer camp program, home school, emerging inventors programs for toddlers as well as travel and offsite tour opportunities. Other specialty programs include holiday nights, antique car shows, garden talks and a variety of special events throughout the year. The site can be reserved for events, weddings, corporate functions, meetings and group tours.\n\nEdison Ford Winter Estates is a National Register Historic Site and received the Award of Excellence for restoration from both the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the National Garden Clubs, Inc. The site is a Florida Historic Landmark and has been designated as a National Historical Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society, the first site in the state of Florida to receive this honor.\n\nThe Edison and Ford Winter Estates research library and archival materials are also available for viewing by appointment. The research library contains over a thousand books on Fort Myers history, botany, as well as biographies on Thomas Edison and Henry Ford and their families.\n\nOpen to the public since 1947, Edison Ford Winter Estates is one of the most-visited historic home sites in America. Designated as an educational and charitable not-for-profit organization, Edison Ford is governed by a board of trustees, professional staff and a large volunteer group.\n\n\n\n"}

But most preferred to elect delegates for a second meeting, should the vote go against them. When it did, the assembly formed its own Restored government of Virginia, recognized by the Federal government, and empowered to authorize the creation of a new state of West Virginia.\n\nThe First Wheeling Convention was held on May 13 through May 15, 1861. 27 northwestern Virginia counties were represented. Of the 429 delegates who attended, over one-third were from the area around Wheeling. Most had been chosen at public meetings, while others attended on their own initiative. William B. Zinn, who had represented Preston County many times in the Virginia General Assembly, was elected chairman. Immediately, a debate ensued over which delegates should be allowed to participate in the Convention: Gen. John Jay Jackson of Wood County suggested seating all northwestern Virginians, but John S. Carlile insisted that only those who had been legitimately appointed by their constituencies be allowed to participate. Chester D. Hubbard of Ohio County ended the debate by proposing the creation of a committee on representation and permanent organization. \n\nSome, including Jackson, argued that preemptive action against the Ordinance of Secession before it was ratified was unwise. The Ordinance of Secession would not be presented to the citizens of Virginia for a vote until May 23. Others, including Carlile, insisted on immediate action to \"show our loyalty to Virginia and the Union,\" and on May 14, he called for a resolution creating a state of New Virginia. Waitman T. Willey responded to Carlile's plan by saying that it was \"triple treason\" — treason against the state of Virginia, the United States, and the Confederacy. Carlile's motion was condemned as revolutionary, and most at the convention instead supported resolutions offered by the Committee on State and Federal Resolutions, which recommended that western Virginians elect delegates to a Second Wheeling Convention to begin on June 11 if the people of Virginia approved the Ordinance of Secession.\n\nA Second Wheeling Convention included 32 western counties, Alexandria and Fairfax County. 29 of the convention delegates were members of the Virginia General Assembly as state delegates or state senators, such as John J.Davis of Harrison County and Lewis Ruffner of Kanawha County. \n\nArthur I. Boreman was selected to serve as president, and he declared, \"We are determined to live under a state government in the United States of America and under the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nCounties adhering to the Confederate cause either did not send representatives or were not entitled to seats. Among the more prominent not to send a delegate to the Wheeling Convention was Greenbrier County. Delegate Mason Mathews from Greenbrier County instead attended the Virginia General Assembly in Confederate Richmond.\n\nMany of the delegates at the Convention believed that the differences between eastern and western Virginia were irreconcilable and supported some sort of separation; the disagreement was over how this separation should occur. Dennis Dorsey of Monongalia County called for permanent and decisive separation from eastern Virginia. Carlile, however, though he had called for a similar plan during the First Convention, persuaded the delegates that constitutional restrictions made it necessary for the formation of a loyal government of Virginia, whose legislature could then give permission for the creation of a new state.\n\nJohn S. Carlile, who had represented transmontane Harrison County as an Unconditional Unionist at the Richmond Secession Convention, was the floor leader at the Second Wheeling Convention who shepherded in the creation of the Restored Virginia Government. On June 14, he expanded on his view of state and federal relations: \"the people of Virginia in establishing government for themselves deemed it best to create two agents. The Federal Government is one, and the State Government is the other...\" Referencing Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, Carlile observed, \"Any act done or performed by the State agent in conflict with the powers conferred upon the Federal agent is to be null and void. Thus it will be seen that within the powers conferred the federal agent is supreme, independent of, and above the State agent. Hence the doctrine of Mr. [Henry] Clay when he said: 'I owe a supreme allegiance to the Federal Government, a subordinate one to my own State.' That very instrument provides for its own alteration, amendment or change. On the application of two-thirds of the principals creating it, amendments can be proposed to it and changes effected, which will become a part and parcel of the original act itself, when ratified by three-fourths of the principals through their legislatures or in their conventions assembled... But [the right of secession] was never intended...\"\n\nOn June 17, Carlile attacked the rebellion as treason: \"it is the result sir, of mature deliberation, concocted in treason, for the express purpose of breaking up constitutional liberty in this country... The plot was one that was conceived in perjury at Washington, and carried out by falsehood throughout the country, attended by coercion, intimidation, insult and a reign of terror, which was equally concerted throughout Virginia, as well as in the other Southern States.\" Carlile then recounted events at the Richmond Secession Convention in which he had been an Unconditional Unionist. \"For several days before the Convention passed the Ordinance of Secession, it was absolutely besieged; members were threatened with being hung to the lamp posts; their lives were jeopardized; the mob was marching up and down the streets, and surrounding the Capitol, and everything was terror and dismay.\"\nCarlile continued to impeach the legitimacy of Virginia's referendum on secession. \"Immediately upon the passage of the Ordinance of Secession, in every county, as far as I can learn, a systematic reign of terror was inaugurated.\" Throughout the state, \"irresponsible persons assembled, under the name of 'committees of safety', who [told Union men] that they must leave the State... All Union men were admonished that they would be prosecuted for treason.\" Carlile then described the days leading up to the referendum: \" Before the day of election arrived we see the troops from South Carolina, Georgia and other Southern States, placed all over the eastern and southern parts of the States running up into the valley, and in some parts of Western Virginia. In those parts of the State freedom of election was completely suppressed, and men who dared to vote against secession done it at the hazard of their lives. Thus, sir, you see the concert by which secession has been inaugurated and carried out in Virginia; and we see that same spirit that reigned in it from the beginning... TREASON...\"\n\nOn June 13, Carlile introduced to the convention \"A Declaration of the People of Virginia.\" The document declared that under the Virginia Declaration of Rights, any substantial change in the form of state government had to be approved by a referendum. Therefore, since the Secession Convention had not been convened by a referendum, all of its acts--including the Ordinance of Secession--were illegal and void. It also declared the existing government in Richmond void and called for the reorganization of the state government on the grounds that Virginia's secession had effectively vacated all state offices. On June 19, delegates approved this plan unanimously.\n\nThe next day, June 20, the convention selected new officers of the Virginia state government (usually called the Restored Government of Virginia to avoid confusion with the secessionist government). Francis Pierpont of Marion County was elected governor. On June 25, the convention adjourned until August 6.\n\nThe delegates to the Second Wheeling Convention of 1861 from counties in western and northern Virginia. \n\nThe proceedings of the First Wheeling Convention were recorded by Judge Gibson Lamb Cranmer of Ohio County, Charles B. Waggener of Mason County, and Marshall M. Dent of Monongalia County. Judge Cranmer was also the Secretary of the Second Wheeling Convention and custodian of the manuscript proceedings, journals, and other documents of the Convention. However, his records for the convention were lost during an 1884 flood of Wheeling Island. Copies of the records were sought in Alexandria and Richmond but none were found. Virgil A. Lewis, State Historian of West Virginia, reconstructed them from daily records printed in the Wheeling \"Daily Intelligencer\", and published them as \"How West Virginia Was Made\" in 1909.\n\n\n\n"}

The club is affiliated with Östergötlands Fotbollförbund and plays their home games at Kopparvallen. The club colours, reflected in their crest and kit, are blue and white. Formed on 1 July 1907 as Åtvidabergs IF, the club was most successful during the 1970s when they won two national championship titles and two national cup titles. With a population of around 7,000, Åtvidaberg is the smallest town ever to bring home a Swedish league title. They currently play in Division 1, where the season lasts from April to November.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the small town club Åtvidabergs IF played in the fifth tier of Swedish football. However, local businessman Elof Ericsson was determined to change this. He became chairman of the board and took the initiative of separating the different sections of the multisport club, thus forming a new club, Åtvidabergs FF, out of the football section. Through his company Facit, which employed a large portion of the small Åtvidaberg population, he was also able to increase the funding for the team.\n\nÅtvidaberg became early forerunners with their strategy to scout players nationally instead of just locally. Since all players in Sweden at the time were amateurs, their ability to offer new signings a good job at the Facit factory made them an attractive club to play for. This, together with the hiring of foreign coaches like Kálmán Konrád, helped the club move up through the divisions, establishing them in the second tier and playing one year in Allsvenskan.\n\nThe years that followed would prove to be Åtvidabergs FF's most successful ever. During this period, they recruited players like Ralf Edström, Roland Sandberg and Conny Torstensson.\n\nIn 1967, they were promoted to Allsvenskan and five years later they won the league for the first time ever and repeated the year after in 1973. Ironically, this golden age came at exactly the same time as the Facit company, which had enabled the success, struggled greatly and eventually was sold off to Electrolux.\n\nAfter struggling greatly in the 1990s and falling as low as the fourth tier with attendance numbers in the hundreds, Åtvidaberg had managed to climb back up to the second tier again by the start of the new millennium. In an effort to further strengthen their organization and finances, the club started a cooperation with reigning champions Djurgårdens IF in 2003. The deal also included a loan of several Djurgården players to Åtvidaberg. In 2005, the Djurgården chairman said that the team should move to the nearby city of Linköping, that did not have a club in the higher divisions. The proposal was met by a negative reaction from the Åtvidaberg supporters. The cooperation finally collapsed in 2006 when Åtvidaberg Municipality refused to cover any potential economic losses for Djurgården.\n\nIn the following years, Åtvidaberg finished in the top half of the Superettan table and finally in 2009 they were promoted back to Allsvenskan for the first time since 1982. They were relegated again but bounced back immediately and achieved an eighth-place finish in the 2012 Allsvenskan. During the upcoming seasons, Åtvidaberg finished mid-table in the top tier with the help of the three key players that long had stayed faithful with the club: goalkeeper Henrik Gustavsson (that made 487 league appearances between 1997–2015), central defender Daniel Hallingström (350 appearances and 29 goals between 1999–2000 and 2002–2015) and midfielder Kristian Bergström (489 appearances and 118 goals between 1992–1997 and 2004–2015). All three players retired after the 2015 season, as Åtvidaberg finished 16th and last in Allsvenskan and got relegated back to Superettan. \n\nTwo years later, in 2017, the club got relegated from Superettan to the third tier, Division 1.\n\n\"As of 10 July 2018\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The club, formed 1916, is currently playing in the fourth tier of Swedish football, Division 2.\n\nNote that the s in the first part of the club name (Bodens) is the Swedish possessive s, meaning that it is not correct to call the club just Bodens. Correct forms are Bodens Bandyklubb (the complete name, very formal), Bodens BK (abbreviated formal), BBK (abbreviated informal), or just Boden (since there are no other football clubs with the town name Boden in their name). Bandyklubb means bandy club, but the club has actually not been playing bandy since 1966.\n\nDuring the three seasons of 2003 to 2005, Boden played in the second highest division, Superettan, which made them the northernmost team in Swedish professional football by a margin of 400 km or more, depending on season.\n\nAfter successfully staying up with some margin in 2003, the ensuing season saw Boden barely scrape through to avoid relegation on the last day of the season. The 2005 Superettan campaign appeared to be the most successful thus far, and included memorable victories against teams such as the previous year's top-flight residents Örebro SK (1–0) and AIK (5–1). With 24 games played and stunning form Boden seemed safe at mid-table, but failure to win or even draw any of their last six games, together with the Phoenix-like resurrection of near-discarded Mjällby AIF, saw the latter team secure a new contract while relegating Boden to the newly recreated Division 1.\n\nFor the 2006 season, the club which had managed to keep hold of several key players, entertained an outspoken ambition of instantly returning to Superettan. However, injuries to important staff such as the two main new signings, New Zealand striker Brent Fisher and American midfielder Ryan Caugherty, as well as poor results away from home, meant the team finished at a mediocre 8th place. The following season resulted in another mid-table finish. In 2008, Boden were relegated from Division 1 after finishing last, failing to record a single win in their last nine games.\n\nUnlike what had been the case after their Superettan relegation in 2005, Boden did manage to immediately bounce back from Division 2 in 2009. In their first season back at Sweden's fourth tier level since 1998, the club produced a strong season finish, winning eight out of their last nine games and eventually the league, five points clear of local rivals IFK Luleå. Once back in Division 1, the objective for 2010 was survival, which was ensured only in the last game of the season, when Boden defeated Carlstad United away from home, leapfrogging that team into 10th place and a renewed contract. Unable to repeat the accomplishment, Boden were again relegated to Division 2 in 2011, finishing nine points from safety and winning only four league games.\n\nIn the two years that followed, Boden were unable to regain promotion, finishing fifth in Division 2 on both occasions. In 2014, the club produced an eighth-place finish, after uninspiring results.\n\nThe club is affiliated to the Norrbottens Fotbollförbund\n\n\nIn recent seasons Bodens BK FF have had the following average attendances:\n\n"}

When a fluid (whether liquid or gaseous) passes through the orifice, its pressure builds up slightly upstream of the orifice but as the fluid is forced to converge to pass through the hole, the velocity increases and the fluid pressure decreases. A little downstream of the orifice the flow reaches its point of maximum convergence, the \"vena contracta\" (see drawing to the right) where the velocity reaches its maximum and the pressure reaches its minimum. Beyond that, the flow expands, the velocity falls and the pressure increases. By measuring the difference in fluid pressure across tappings upstream and downstream of the plate, the flow rate can be obtained from Bernoulli's equation using coefficients established from extensive research.\n\nIn general, the mass flow rate \"formula_1\" measured in kg/s across an orifice can be described as\n\nSolving for formula_3:\n\nformula_4\n\nand:\n\nformula_5\n\nThe above expression for formula_3 gives the theoretical volume flow rate. Introducing the beta factor formula_7 as well as the discharge coefficient formula_8:\n\nformula_9\n\nAnd finally introducing the meter coefficient formula_10 which is defined as formula_11 to obtain the final equation for the volumetric flow of the fluid through the orifice which accounts for irreversible losses:\n\nformula_12\n\nMultiplying by the density of the fluid to obtain the equation for the mass flow rate at any section in the pipe:\n\nformula_13\n\nDeriving the above equations used the cross-section of the orifice opening and is not as realistic as using the minimum cross-section at the vena contracta. In addition, frictional losses may not be negligible and viscosity and turbulence effects may be present. For that reason, the coefficient of discharge formula_8 is introduced. Methods exist for determining the coefficient of discharge as a function of the Reynolds number.\n\nThe parameter formula_15 is often referred to as the \"velocity of approach factor\" and multiplying the coefficient of discharge by that parameter (as was done above) produces the flow coefficient formula_10. Methods also exist for determining the flow coefficient as a function of the beta function formula_17 and the location of the downstream pressure sensing tap. For rough approximations, the flow coefficient may be assumed to be between 0.60 and 0.75. For a first approximation, a flow coefficient of 0.62 can be used as this approximates to fully developed flow.\n\nAn orifice only works well when supplied with a fully developed flow profile. This is achieved by a long upstream length (20 to 40 pipe diameters, depending on Reynolds number) or the use of a flow conditioner. Orifice plates are small and inexpensive but do not recover the pressure drop as well as a venturi, nozzle, or venturi-nozzle does. Venturis also require much less straight pipe upstream. A venturi meter is more efficient, but usually more expensive and less accurate (unless calibrated in a laboratory) than an orifice plate.\n\nIn general, equation (2) is applicable only for incompressible flows. It can be modified by introducing the expansibility factor, (also called the expansion factor) formula_18 to account for the compressibility of gasses.\n\nformula_19\n\nformula_18 is 1.0 for incompressible fluids and it can be calculated for compressible gases using empirically determined formulae as shown below in computation.\n\nFor smaller values of β (such as restriction plates with β less than 0.25 and discharge from tanks), if the fluid is compressible, the rate of flow depends on whether the flow has become choked. If it is, then the flow may be calculated as shown at choked flow (although the flow of real gases through thin-plate orifices never becomes fully choked). By using a mechanical energy balance, compressible fluid flow in un-choked conditions may be calculated as:\n\nformula_21\n\nor\n\nformula_22\n\nUnder choked flow conditions, the fluid flow rate becomes:\nformula_23\n\nor\n\nformula_24\n\nFlow rates through an orifice plate can be calculated without specifically calibrating the individual flowmeter so long as the construction and installation of the device complies with the stipulations of the relevant standard or handbook. The calculation takes account of the fluid and fluid conditions, the pipe size, the orifice size and the measured differential pressure; it also takes account of the coefficient of discharge of the orifice plate, which depends upon the orifice type and the positions of the pressure tappings. With local pressure tappings (corner, flange and D+D/2), sharp-edged orifices have coefficients around 0.6 to 0.63, while the coefficients for conical entrance plates are in the range 0.73 to 0.734 and for quarter-circle plates 0.77 to 0.85. The coefficients of sharp-edged orifices vary more with fluids and flow rates than the coefficients of conical-entrance and quarter-circle plates, especially at low flows and high viscosities.\n\nFor compressible flows such as flows of gases or steam, an \"expansibility factor\" or \"expansion factor\" is also calculated. This factor is primarily a function of the ratio of the measured differential pressure to the fluid pressure and so can vary significantly as the flow rate varies, especially at high differential pressures and low static pressures.\n\nThe equations provided in American and European national and industry standards and the various coefficients used to differ from each other even to the extent of using different combinations of correction factors, but many are now closely aligned and give identical results; in particular, they use the same \"Reader-Harris/Gallagher (1998)\" equation for the coefficient of discharge for sharp-edged orifice plates. The equations below largely follow the notation of the international standard ISO 5167 and use SI units.\n\nVolume flow rate:\n\nMass flow rate:\n\nCoefficient of discharge for sharp-edged orifice plates with corner, flange or D and D/2 tappings and no drain or vent hole (Reader-Harris/Gallagher equation):\n\nExpansibility factor, also called expansion factor, for sharp-edged orifice plates with corner, flange or D and D/2 tappings:\n\nThe overall pressure loss caused by an orifice plate is less than the differential pressure measured across tappings near the plate. For sharp-edged plates such as corner, flange or D and D/2 tappings, it can be approximated by the equation\nor\n"}

It is made from cow's milk, and is one of the cheeses granted the Appellation d'origine contrôlée from the French government.\n\nBleu d'Auvergne was developed in the mid-1850s by a French cheesemaker named Antoine Roussel. Roussel noted that the occurrence of blue molds on his curd resulted in an agreeable taste, and conducted experiments to determine how veins of such mold could be induced. After several failed tests, Roussel discovered that the application of rye bread mold created the veining, and that pricking the curd with a needle provided increased aeration. It allowed the mold to enter the curd and encouraged its growth. Subsequently, his discovery and techniques spread throughout the region.\n\nToday, bleu d'Auvergne is prepared via mechanical needling processes. It is then aged for approximately four weeks in cool, wet cellars before distribution, a relatively short period for blue cheeses.\n\nBleu d'Auvergne has a strong and pungent taste, but to a lesser extent than other blue cheeses; it is less salted, with a creamier and more buttery taste and a moister texture. Some versions use a weaker form of mold, \"Penicillium glaucum\", to create the blue veins, rather than the \"Penicillium roqueforti\" used in Roquefort and other blue cheeses.\n\nBleu d'Auvergne is often used in salad dressings and pasta seasonings, and it is also a good cheese for snacking. Sweet wines such as dessert-style riesling and sauvignon blanc or strong, robust red wines are commonly recommended to accompany it as well as rich, dark beer such as English barley wine or American porter, which have both the sweetness and bold flavor required to balance the cheese.\n"}

Fans also refers to the club as Grönsvart (green-black) or Makrillarna (the Mackerels) because of the traditional shirt colours.\n\nGAIS is one of the oldest football clubs in Sweden. The club was a founding member of Allsvenskan and also the first champions of the league. They have won a total of four national championship titles, five league championship titles and one national cup title. Even though GAIS have played 49 seasons in Allsvenskan they only spent six years in the top division during a 30-year period from 1976 to 2005, with another six seasons of that time spent as low as the third division. The club thus gained the reputation of being a yo-yo club, constantly going up and down through the league system. After their promotion in 2005 the club played seven straight seasons in Allsvenskan which was a feat not achieved since the degradation in 1955. After relegation in 2012 they finished seventh in Superettan in 2013 and has remained there since.\n\nGAIS was founded 11 March 1894 at Ehdlunds Café in the Gothenburg city centre. The founders had created the club for \"patriotic purposes and to promote all kinds of sports\". Its main activities were athletics and an assortment of strength sports. The football department was formed in 1897 and played their first official game against local rivals Örgryte IS in 1903. GAIS first appearance in the highest league at the time, Svenska Serien, was in 1915/16 where they finished in fourth place. In 1919 the club won its first national championship beating Djurgårdens IF away in the finals. The same procedure would be repeated in 1922, this time against another Stockholm team, Hammarby IF. GAIS won the first season of the new first tier league Allsvenskan in 1924/25, two points ahead of local rivals IFK Göteborg. The feat was to be repeated in 1926/27, this time three points ahead of IFK Göteborg. The league champions was not recognised as national champions until the 1930/31 season. GAIS won this year as well, six points ahead of AIK and IFK Göteborg.\n\nDuring the 1930s GAIS slowly lost the dominance the club had exercised over Allsvenskan since its foundation and in 1938 the club was relegated. Having spent three years in the second division GAIS returned with a vengeance for the 1941–42 Allsvenskan where the club finished in second place. Later in 1942 they won Svenska Cupen for the first, and until today, only time.\n\nThe club then stayed in Allsvenskan throughout the 1940s and the early 1950s. They quite unexpectedly won their fourth national championship one single point ahead of Helsingborgs IF in the season of 1953/54. The clinching game was the last one of the season; a nail biting no score draw at Stadsparksvallen in Jönköping. The following year, equally unexpectedly, when the club finished third last and was relegated.\n\nGAIS returned to Allsvenskan the following 1955/56 season but from the mid-1950s the club lost its former continuity and never spent more than five years in a row in Allsvenskan until the 2000s. The club was relegated again in 1959 and spent four seasons in the second division only to return briefly to Allsvenskan for one year in 1964. After that relegation they immediately returned to Allsvenskan in 1966. GAIS then remained there during 1966–1975, except for one year in the second division in 1971. In 1975 the club made its first appearance in the UEFA Cup playing Śląsk Wrocław in the first leg. GAIS lost out to the Polish club after winning 2–1 at home but losing 2–4 away. The same year GAIS got relegated from Allsvenskan for the sixth time, this time due to scoring two goals less than Halmstads BK.\n\nThe relegation in 1975 would in retrospect prove to be a turning point for the worse in the history of GAIS. Unable to qualify for Allsvenskan in 1976, and furthermore losing the qualifying spot to now arch-rivals IFK Göteborg, they lost the position as Gothenburg's leading team that they had enjoyed throughout the early 1970s. The club then consistently failed to qualify for Allsvenskan during the following five years and in 1981 the club got relegated to the Swedish third division due to economical problems and a surprisingly weak performance by the squad. The future looked bleak after GAIS failed to return to the second division in 1982 but due to a massive performance in the latter part of the 1983 season the club secured the qualifying spot seven points ahead of IK Oddevold and then beat Mönsterås GoIF in the promotion playoffs to the second division.\nIn 1984 GAIS made what was to become one of the club's most spectacular signings to this date. Tunisian midfielder Samir Bakaou left his former club Étoile Sportive du Sahel to join the Gothenburg side and proved to be the injection of flair and energy that the club had been needing so badly. With \"the Black Pearl\" as playmaker and notorious goalscorer GAIS was once again a force to be reckoned with and made it to the promotion playoffs to Allsvenskan in 1985, only to lose out to Djurgårdens IF after a penalty shoot-out in a highly controversial game. GAIS finally made it back to Allsvenskan in 1987 ending eleven long years of struggling in the lower divisions. For the second time in club history GAIS made it to the finals of Svenska Cupen as well, but lost out 2–0 to opposing side Kalmar FF.\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s GAIS mostly fought for its survival in Allsvenskan. With the exception of a third place in 1989 the club had to settle for the lower half of the league table. Relegation followed in the season of 1992 and GAIS yet again had to face a long and tortuous walk through the Swedish second division. The nadir was reached in 1997 when the club had been relegated to the third division and ran a huge economical deficit while only finishing third in the league. This season would be the starting point of possibly the worst yo-yo experience any Swedish football club has ever experienced.\n\nGAIS was promoted to the second division in 1998 and made it back to Allsvenskan after the season of 1999 by finishing in second place and defeating Kalmar FF in the qualifying round. After finishing second to last in the 2000 Allsvenskan the club continued its fall through the second division Superettan in 2001 and was relegated to the third division for the 2002 season. From there on things slowed down when GAIS failed to make a quick return during their first season there. Then after a hard-fought battle throughout 2003 against local competitors Ljungskile SK GAIS finally ended up winning the series by goal difference. In the promotion playoffs to qualify for Superettan the club faced Mjällby AIF and defeated them 2–1 away as well as home.\n\nThe next year GAIS signed Roland Nilsson as head coach, and with him at the lead the club finished in sixth place of the 2004 Superettan. During the following season, facing competition from newly relegated AIK and Östers IF, GAIS managed to finish third and got to play Landskrona BoIS in the promotion playoffs to Allsvenskan. After beating Landskrona 2–1 at home and drawing them 0–0 in an extremely tight away game, where GAIS forward Wilton Figueiredo got his second yellow card after 30 minutes of play and manager Roland Nilsson substituted defender Kenneth Gustafsson for himself during the last 25 minutes, GAIS finally got to make their return to Allsvenskan. There they would spend their next seven seasons but after a strong fifth-place finish in 2011 they ended up in last place and relegated in 2012. They have since remained in the swedish second tier.\n\nAccording to polls GAIS are the second most supported club in Gothenburg, with 12% of the people in the city who follow a football team claiming to have GAIS as their favorite side. Their supporters have traditionally been perceived as coming from the working class-districts of Gothenburg and having left wing sympathies, even though research on the subject couldn't conclude that this were more true than for other clubs. Their supporters are also perceived as being loyal, despite whatever hardships the club may face. The oldest and primary GAIS supporter group is called Makrillarna (meaning \"the Mackerels\") and was founded in 1961.\n\nDuring the 2018 season the club chose to allow a supporter to act as an assisting manager for a single game, against Halmstads BK in September, which at the time were unique amongst Swedish football clubs.\n\nThe club and its supporters harbour a fierce rivalry with Gothenburg's other traditional working-class team IFK Göteborg. Attendance rates are normally around 4500–7000 when playing in top tier Allsvenskan and 3000–4000 in second tier Superettan with greater numbers attending against local rivals IFK Göteborg, Örgryte IS and IF Elfsborg as well as the biggest teams from Stockholm and Skåne.\n\n15 – Fredrik Lundgren, defender and midfielder (1999–2002, 2003–2012)\n\nKarl-Alfred Jacobsson has been selected as both player of the century\" and player of the millennium by GAIS fans.

The following players have received the award:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1825410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825410", "title": "Atlantic Avenue (Boston)", "text": "Atlantic Avenue (Boston)\n\nAtlantic Avenue is a street in downtown Boston, Massachusetts, partly serving as a frontage road for the underground Central Artery (I-93) and partly running along the Boston Harbor. It has a long history, with several relocations along the way.\n\nWhat is now Atlantic Avenue was once part of Broad Street, only existing from the road still known as Broad Street south to Dewey Square (the front of South Station. Federal Street (which now only goes north from Dewey Square) continued south from Dewey Square through the current location of South Station to the Federal Street Bridge (now the Dorchester Street Bridge) and on to South Boston and points south.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1874, the section north of Broad Street was built, taking it into Commercial Street, with which it formed a waterfront route around the North End, and the portion of Broad Street south of the new road was renamed Atlantic Avenue. This new alignment took it across the middle of several former wharves, notably Long Wharf, and the water west of Atlantic Avenue was filled in. The Union Freight Railroad was completed in 1872, taking freight between the lines on the north and south sides of downtown, and running along the middle of the full length of Atlantic Avenue.\n\nIn 1899, South Station opened, and as part of that project Federal Street was closed south of Dewey Square, and Atlantic Avenue was extended south along a new alignment on the west side of South Station. The Union Freight Railroad, which had used Federal Street, was also realigned onto the new alignment. Just south of Kneeland Street, the railroad continued straight but Atlantic Avenue had a quick S-curve to shift to the west side of the railroad, where it slowly rose and then turned southeast onto the Atlantic Avenue Viaduct over the full approach to South Station (the Boston and Albany and New York, New Haven and Hartford railroads), which after crossing the railroads immediately turned back to the south and crossed the Fort Point Channel. The road ended at the large intersection of Dorchester Avenue, Foundry Street and West First Street, serving the same purpose as Federal Street - taking vehicles to this intersection from Dewey Square.\n\nThe viaduct was gone by 1923, and Atlantic Avenue was truncated to just south of Kneeland Street at the S-curve. Traffic formerly using Atlantic Avenue to South Boston now used Dorchester Avenue around the east side of South Station, or headed west on Kneeland Street and south on Albany Street to one of the other Fort Point Channel crossings.\n\nThe next change happened in the 1950s, when the Central Artery (now I-93) was built. From Broad and High Streets south to Dewey Square, Atlantic Avenue was made one-way northbound as a frontage road for the Artery, with southbound traffic using Purchase Street on the other side of the Artery. Atlantic Avenue was kept two-way south of Dewey Square, where through traffic used the Surface Artery.\n\nThe Union Freight Railroad was abandoned in 1970, removing tracks from the center of Atlantic Avenue. Soon after, the road was realigned inland from Broad and High Streets most of the way to its north end, where it turned northeast and returned to its original alignment for the final block to Commercial Street, roughly along the old Mercantile and Richmond Streets. A short section of Old Atlantic Avenue exists in the original location between Milk and State Streets.\n\nWhen the Big Dig put the Artery underground in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the full section along the Artery, as well as the southern end, was converted to one-way northbound, with southbound traffic on the other side, known in sections as Surface Artery, Purchase Street and again Surface Artery. The new northbound tunnel was built under Atlantic Avenue south of Dewey Square. Only the part curving away from the Artery to end at Commercial Street remained two-way. South of Kneeland Street, a ramp from the northbound Artery and its frontage road joins the intersection of Kneeland Street and Atlantic Avenue.\n\nBy 1871, the Dorchester Avenue Railroad ran along Atlantic Avenue south of Broad Street (still called Broad Street at the time) as part of its route between downtown and Dorchester. However, 1872 and 1874 maps show these tracks removed in favor of tracks along Beach Street. An 1888 map appears to show tracks again, along the full length of Atlantic Avenue (ending at the Commercial Street merge), and an 1897 map shows tracks not only on all of Atlantic Avenue but also on Commercial Street towards North Station.\n\nIn 1872, the Union Freight Railroad was built along Atlantic Avenue, connecting freight lines on both sides of downtown. It was removed in 1970. The 1899 extension of Atlantic Avenue also resulted in a realignment of the railroad.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1938 (torn down in the early 1940s), the Atlantic Avenue Elevated carried passengers above Atlantic Avenue north of Beach Street.\n\nBy 1925, all streetcar tracks had been removed from the central part of downtown, and tracks along Atlantic Avenue north of Summer Street (Dewey Square) took streetcars around downtown. These too were gone by 1953.\n\nBuses on the 6 South Station - Haymarket Station via North End route now use the full length of Atlantic Avenue (northbound only along the Big Dig).\n\nNone of Atlantic Avenue has ever been part of a numbered state, U.S. or Interstate route.\n\n\n"}

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 16, 1999. In the episode, after being robbed by Snake Jailbird, the Simpsons visit a money-saving seminar, where they learn ways to limit their expenses. Soon, the family can afford a cheap last-minute flight to another country, the only disadvantage being that they do not know where their plane tickets will bring them, which leads them to spend their vacation in Japan.\n\nThe episode was written by Donick Cary and Dan Greaney, while Jim Reardon served as director. It was one of the last episodes written in its production line, and its title is a reference to the war film \"30 Seconds Over Tokyo\". Several guest-stars appeared in the episode, including George Takei as the host for \"The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show\". This episode mocks aspects of the Japanese, including the cruelty of Japanese game shows.\n\nThe episode was seen by approximately 8 million viewers in its original broadcast. In 2005, the episode was first released on home video, and in 2007, it was released as part of the tenth season DVD box set. \n\nFollowing the tenth season's home video release, \"Thirty Minutes over Tokyo\" received mixed reviews from critics. Because of a scene in which the Emperor of Japan is thrown into a trunk filled with sumo thongs, the episode has never aired in Japan, as the scene was considered disrespectful.\n\nWhile visiting an Internet café with Bart and Lisa, Homer gets cyber-robbed by an illegal download done by Snake of his bank's entire savings account, which the family planned to use for their own family vacation. When Ned Flanders catches Homer and Marge burgling his house, he says he got more for less by attending the Chuck Garabedian Mega-Savings Seminar. Homer steals Ned's tickets and the Simpsons attend the seminar, in which Chuck explains many money-saving strategies. The Simpsons follow them and save enough for a Garabedian-sponsored vacation. Bart and Lisa, with help from Maggie, steal airplane tickets from the Flanders at the airport and go to Tokyo, Japan.\n\nHomer and Bart separate from Marge, who wants to go back to the hotel, and Lisa, who wants to do something Japanese, to go attend a sumo match. When a wrestler steals Homer's pretzel, he and Bart subdue him, then when the Emperor of Japan, Akihito, congratulates Homer, he behaves like King Kong, throwing him into a dumpster of worn mawashi. As a result, he and Bart are put in jail until Marge pays the bail. Consequently, the only money the family has left is a one-million yen bill, which Lisa loses in the wind after Homer created an origami crane from it.\n\nThe family finds work in a fish-gutting factory in Osaka, where they notice a TV game show called \"The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show\". They go on it, telling the host Wink that they wish for plane tickets to Springfield. In order to get them, they must go through physical torture, including picking them up from a rickety bridge over an active volcano (particularly Homer). Lisa's help is congratulated as she is able to get the tickets, but Wink breaks the bridge and the whole family falls into the volcano, which is actually scrummy Orangeade with lots of wasabi added. As the Simpsons leave Japan, their plane is briefly confronted by four giant monsters – Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and Rodan before it flies off on the journey to Springfield.\n\nThe episode, which was originally titled \"Fat Man and Little Boy\" (which went on to be used for the name of a Season 16 episode), was directed by Jim Reardon and written by Donick Cary and Dan Greaney. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 16, 1999. \"Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo\" was one of the last episodes produced for the series' tenth season. Staff writers Cary and Greaney wrote the draft in a couple of days, and it was then rewritten \"extensively\" with \"The Simpsons\" writing staff. Originally, there would be a long scene about how Homer had bought a \"pre-Columbian vase\" on the Internet, however the scene was ultimately cut from the episode. The episode's title is a reference to the 1944 war film \"30 Seconds Over Tokyo\". Originally, the staff wanted the title to be \"Twenty-two Minutes Over Tokyo\", since an episode of \"The Simpsons\" is approximately twenty-two minutes long, but they eventually changed it to its current rendition because it “sounds closer to” the title of the film it references. According to Cary, the writers did a lot of research in order to accurately depict the Japanese language for the episode. For example, the three categories in \"The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show\" are written in Japanese.\n\nIn the scene at the seminar, a character closely resembling the mascot of Hasbro's \"Monopoly\" can be seen sitting next to Mr. Burns. Because the design is slightly different from the real-life mascot, the \"Simpsons\" staff did not have to pay Hasbro for using their character in the episode. The design of Homer in a Jamaican attire was very popular among the staff, and Mike Scully, the showrunner for the episode, called the design \"great\". A scene in the episode shows Homer buying a square watermelon, which turns out to be round and slips out of his hands. In the background, cars are driving on the left side of the street. Originally, the animators had drawn the cars driving on the right side. However, Tomi Yamaguchi, a \"Simpsons\" layout artist at the time, pointed out that cars in fact drive on the left side of the street in Japan. Because of this, the animators had to redraw the whole scene, and Yamaguchi received a technical advisor credit for the episode. The speech that Homer gives to the audience in \"The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show\" was originally much longer, and would partially involve kitchenettes from Broyhill. The design of the male Canadian in the game show was based on Canadian \"Simpsons\" director Neil Affleck.\n\nThe anime version of \"The Simpsons\" theme song that plays at the end of the episode was conceived by composer Alf Clausen. Chuck Garabedian, the speaker at the seminar, was portrayed by series regular voice actor Hank Azaria, who plays Moe Szyslak among other characters. The Japanese waiter in Americatown was played by American actor Gedde Watanabe. Wink, the host for \"The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show\", was portrayed by George Takei. Takei has appeared on \"The Simpsons\" several times before, and he is, according to Scully, one of the staff's favorite guest-stars. The episode also features the voices of Tress MacNeille, Denice Kumagai as Japanese mother, Karen Maruyama as Japanese stewardess, Keone Young as the sumo wrestler, and Karl Wiedergott as both Mr. Monopoly and Woody Allen.\n\nIn his book \"Gilligan Unbound\", American literary critic Paul Cantor described how \"Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo\" references and mocks several aspects of Japanese and American culture, as well as differences between the two. At a sumo wrestling match, Bart and Homer encounter the then current Japanese emperor, Akihito. After Homer throws him into a trunk of sumo thongs, Bart and Homer are put in jail, where they have to re-enact a kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin, do origami, flower arranging and meditation. After Marge bails them out, Bart and Homer can speak fluent Japanese, and have fully absorbed, as Cantor writes, the \"exclusionary\" character of the Japanese culture, as Homer asks Bart (in Japanese, with English subtitles): \"Should we tell them [Marge and Lisa] the secret to inner peace?\", to which Bart replies (still in Japanese), \"No, they are foreign devils.\" The episode also references the Japanese's adaption to American culture, and is, according to Cantor, \"filled\" with signs of how eagerly Japanese have taken to American culture. In one scene, the Simpsons eat at a restaurant called Americatown, filled with US memorabilia and having only American items on the menu. Another scene shows director Woody Allen filming a commercial for Japanese television.\n\nIn order to get back to the United States, the Simpsons have to enter a humiliating game show called \"The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show\". According to Cantor, this is where the family find a difference between Japanese and American culture, as Wink, the game-show host, explains to them: \"Our game shows are a little different from yours. Your shows reward knowledge. We punish ignorance.\" The game show is partly based on the Japanese show \"Za Gaman\", as well as the British show \"Family Fortunes\". As with many other episodes in the series, \"Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo\" suggests that, in the end, the Simpsons are more attached to the local than to the global, and, as Cantor writes: \"indeed the global is ultimately important in the series only insofar as it can be made local, that is, part of Springfield. For all its cosmopolitanism, the show keeps returning to the American theme of 'there's no place like home'\".\n\nThe computers seen in the internet cafe that the Simpsons visit in the beginning of the episode are based on the Apple iMac computers. In a scene inside Flanders' kitchen, a note which reads \"1 COR 6:9-11\" can be seen. This refers to the Bible, First Corinthian, chapter 6, verses 9 to 11: \"Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.\" The cups in the 33 cent store read \"That '70s Show\", a reference which Danny Masterson, one of the lead actors in \"That '70s Show\", was entertained by, according to Scully. \"Battling Seizure Robots\", the seizure-inducing television show that the Simpsons watch in their hotel room, is based on an episode of \"Pokémon\", called \"Dennō Senshi Porygon\", which caused 685 children to develop epileptic seizures. According to Scully, the staff received \"several angry letters\" from people for the scene. After the cartoon, an advertisement for Mr. Sparkle, a character that first appeared in the season 8 episode \"In Marge We Trust\", can be seen on the television screen. Barney, while impersonating Homer, says \"That boy ain't right\", a line frequently used by Hank Hill, the main character of the animated television series \"King of the Hill\". The giant monsters attacking at the end of the episode are Godzilla, Gamera, Rodan and Mothra, all of which are famous from Japanese monster movies. The scene was included as a reference to the 1998 action science fiction film \"Godzilla\", in which three of the main \"The Simpsons\" cast members (Azaria, Cartwright and Shearer) had a live-action role.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on May 16, 1999, \"Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo\" received an 8.0 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 8 million viewers. On May 23, 2005, the episode was released along with the season 12 episode \"Simpson Safari\", the season 13 episode \"Blame It on Lisa\" and the season 15 episode \"The Regina Monologues\", as part of a DVD set called \"The Simpsons – Around The World In 80 D'Oh's\". On August 7, 2007, the episode was again released as part of \"The Simpsons – The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set. Matt Groening, Mike Scully, Donick Cary, George Meyer, Ron Hauge, Matt Selman and Jim Reardon participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode.\n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, gave the episode a positive review, and wrote that it was \"A magnificent end to the season.\" They wrote that the episode was \"thoroughly racist\" but \"completely inoffensive because it's simply very funny.\" \n\nJake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News was also favourable, considering it to be one of the better episodes of the season. \n\nJames Plath of DVD Town wrote that the episode has \"some funny moments.\" \n\nAaron Roxby of Collider was more critical, denouncing the episode's dated references. He wrote: \"I am going to go ahead and give this one the benefit of the doubt and assume that making fun of Japanese junk culture and game shows felt fresher in 1999 than it does do now.\" \n\nColin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide called the episode \"mediocre\". He wrote that, though the episode's concept should \"open up lots of interesting possibilities\", it \"doesn't explore them particularly well\". While he did not consider it to be a bad episode, he thought it \"fail[ed] to live up to its potential\".\n\n\"Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo\" is one of two episodes that never aired in Japan (the other being season 11 episode \"Little Big Mom\"). The reasoning behind this was that a scene in the episode, which shows Homer throwing Akihito, the then current emperor of Japan, into a box filled with sumo thongs, was considered disrespectful. There was also a rumor that Sanrio objected to the portrayal of the Hello Kitty factory featured briefly in the episode. The episode has become study material for sociology courses at University of California Berkeley, where it is used to \"examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show\", and to figure out what it is \"trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies\".\n\n\n"}

Firmware upgrades were distributed over-the-air using the normal FreeView distribution method, and are also available for Internet download.\n\nTopfield devices are often referred to as “Toppys”.\n\nThe device has the features expected from a dual-tuner PVR, but also allows extensive software customisation by the use of TAPs (described below). Files (TV programmes, MP3 files, and operating files) can be transferred over USB between the PVR and a computer.\n\nThe TF5800PVR[t] was replaced by the TF5810PVRt with similar functionality, but which also supports HDMI output (from standard, but not HD, broadcasts—reception of Freeview HD channels requires a DVB-T2 receiver, which the TF5810PVRt is not). The latest factory firmware versions for both models incorporate some features equivalent to Freeview+.\n\nThe USB 2.0 socket allows files to be transported both ways between the device and a computer running transfer software written for this purpose. Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and some versions of Linux/Unix are supported. Files of any kind can be moved in both directions but the feature is mainly used\n\nUSB file transfer is rather slow. It can be accelerated to some extent by using the transfer software's Turbo mode and by using TAPs which eliminate unnecessary handshaking signals.\n\nThe functionality of the TF5800PVR can be enhanced via the use of Topfield Application Programs (TAP). TAPs are C programs, developed by users for users. They can be developed under Microsoft Windows using a Topfield platform cross-compiler (GCC for TAP) or the Cygwin GCC compiler.\n\nTAPs are applications written using an API available free from the manufacturer. The API provides access to almost all features of the device: TAPs can access EPG information, change channels, start or stop a recording session, change pre-set recording timers, write text and draw graphics to the screen, and react to buttons pressed on the remote control. It is possible to write a useful program, adding useful functionality, in ten lines of C code.\n\nTAPs have been written to provide many enhancements to the Toppy. Most are available as freeware. Although some technical users consider enhancement via TAPs to be the best thing about the device, the PVR works normally without any.\n\nFirmware can be downloaded to a computer and transferred via USB to the PVR. Unlike the majority of electronics devices, many users do not recommend always updating to the manufacturer's latest firmware, instead recommending versions of firmware that have been debugged and enhanced by users. the Toppy website recommended TF5800PVR/PVRt firmware 5.13.65T, a modified version of August 2007 factory firmware 5.13.65. The last firmware released by the manufacturer was the July 2008 5.14.09Plus. Different releases apply to the TF5810PVRt.\n\nPatches to the firmware can be downloaded to a computer and transferred to the PVR.\n\n"}

As such, it is one of the oldest collegiate societies in North America. It is also the second oldest Greek-lettered organization in the United States, after Phi Beta Kappa. The Society's Greek-letters are , initials for (\"philoi, patris, theos,\" or \"brotherhood, fatherland, divinity\"). Its Latin motto, , is taken from Virgil's \"Aeneid\" and roughly translated, \"In the future it will be pleasing to remember these things.\"\n\nThe Society regularly meets on Friday evenings at Hotel C in the Academical Village, referred to as \"Jefferson Hall\", \"Jeff Hall\", or simply \"The Hall\". Room Seven, West Lawn, is also maintained by the Jefferson Society, selecting a Fourth Year student to live there. The Society hosts several events throughout the year including its Distinguished Speaker Series, for which it invites prominent scholars and speakers across disciplines to address students. The Society also hosts formal social events including Wilson's Day, the Restoration Ball, and Founder's Day, first held in 1832.\nMembership in the Society grew rapidly in the early years after its founding. By 1855, the University of Virginia was the second largest University in the nation after Harvard University, enrolling 645 students. That school year, the Society admitted 155 new members: nearly a quarter of the student body of the University.\n\nIn the hotheaded antebellum years, the Society could become raucous. Its elections were condemned by the Faculty for \"such turbulence as to degrade the reputation of the University.\" An especially coveted honor was to be selected as \"final orator,\" a post apparently comparable to that of a valedictorian today.\n\nThe Society played a key role in establishing student journalism at the University, founding the University Magazine as early as 1856. Later known as the \"Virginia Spectator\", the paper played a major part in University life for a century, with its profile ranging from high seriousness to satire, until being shut down by the president of the University in the late 1950s for obscenity. The Jefferson Society sponsored the magazine for many decades.\n\nAlso in 1856, the Society expressed its approval of the caning of Charles Sumner by sending Preston Brooks a new gold-headed cane to replace his broken one.\n\n\n\n\nThomas Jefferson turned down an invitation for honorary membership in an August 12, 1825 letter, citing his need to avoid altering his relationship with the University and its students.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1825434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825434", "title": "Imperial Way Faction", "text": "Imperial Way Faction\n\nThe Kōdōha or was a political faction in the Imperial Japanese Army active in the 1920s and 1930s. The \"Kōdōha\" sought to establish a military government that promoted totalitarian, militaristic and aggressive expansionistic ideals, and was largely supported by junior officers. The radical \"Kōdōha\" rivaled the moderate \"Tōseiha\" (Control Faction) for influence in the army until the February 26 Incident in 1936, when it was \"de facto\" dissolved and many supporters were disciplined or executed. \n\nThe \"Kōdōha\" was never an organized political party and had no official standing within the Army, but its ideology and supporters continued to influence Japanese militarism into the late 1930s.\n\nThe Empire of Japan had enjoyed economic growth during World War I but this ended in the early 1920s with the Shōwa financial crisis. Social unrest increased with the growing polarization of society and inequalities, such as trafficking in girls, with the labor unions increasingly influenced by socialism, communism and anarchism, but the industrial and financial leaders of Japan continued to get wealthier through their inside connections with politicians and bureaucrats. The military was considered \"clean\" in terms of political corruption, and elements within the army were determined to take direct action to eliminate the perceived threats to Japan created by the weaknesses of liberal democracy and political corruption.\n\nThe founders of the Kōdōha were General Sadao Araki and his protégé, Jinzaburō Masaki. Araki was a noted political philosopher within the army, who linked the ancient Japanese \"bushido\" code of the \"samurai\" with ideas similar to European fascism to form the ideological basis of his philosophy, which linked the Emperor, the people, land and morality as one and indivisible.\n\nThe \"Kōdōha\" envisioned a return to an idealized pre-industrialized, pre-westernized Japan in which the state was to be purged of corrupt bureaucrats, opportunistic politicians, and greedy \"zaibatsu\" capitalists. The state would be run directly by Emperor Hirohito in a \"Shōwa Restoration\" assisted by the military. Domestically, the state would return to the traditional values of Japan, and externally, war with the Soviet Union was not only unavoidable, but necessary to eliminate the perceived threat posed by communism. In a news conference in September 1932, Araki first mentioned the word \"\"Kōdōha\"\" (\"The Imperial Way\"), from which his movement received its popular name.\n\nAraki became Minister of War in the cabinet of Prime Minister Inukai in 1931, and Masaki became Vice Chief of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff. Both began to purge followers of their rival General Kazushige Ugaki from important posts in both the ministry and the general staff. Whereas Ugaki was pushing for a modernization of the military in terms of materials and technology, Araki and his followers argued that the spiritual training, or élan, of the Army was more important.\n\nTetsuzan Nagata and Hideki Tōjō created the \"Tōseiha\" (Control Faction) group, a loose faction united mostly by their opposition to Araki and his \"Kōdōha\".\n\nFundamental to both factions, however, was the common belief that national defense must be strengthened through a reform of national politics. Both factions adopted some ideas from totalitarian and fascist political philosophies, and espoused a strong skepticism of political party politics and representative democracy. However, rather than the confrontational approach of the \"Kōdōha\", which wanted to bring about a revolution, the \"Tōseiha\" foresaw that a future war would be a total war, which would require the cooperation of the bureaucracy and the \"zaibatsu\" conglomerates to maximize Japan's industrial and military capacity. The \"Kōdōha\" was strongly supportive of the Strike North strategy of a preemptive strike against the Soviet Union, but the \"Tōseiha\" wanted a \"more cautious\" defense expansion by the Strike South policy.\n\nAfter the Manchurian Incident, the two cliques struggled against each other for dominance over the military. The \"Kōdōha\" was initially dominant; however, after the resignation of Araki in 1934 due to ill health, the \"Kōdōha\" began to suffer a decline in its influence. Araki was replaced by General Senjūrō Hayashi, who had \"Tōseiha\" sympathies.\n\nIn November 1934, a plot by \"Kōdōha\" army officers to murder a number of important politicians was discovered before it could be implemented. The \"Tōseiha\" faction forced the resignation of Masaki from his position as Inspector General of Military Education (the third most powerful position in the Japanese Army hierarchy) for his complicity in the plot, and demoted some 3,000 other officers.\n\nIn retaliation, a \"Kōdōha\" officer, Saburō Aizawa, murdered \"Tōseiha\" leader General Tetsuzan Nagata in the Aizawa Incident. Aizawa's military tribunal was held under the jurisdiction of the First Infantry Division in Tokyo, whose commander, General Heisuke Yanagawa, was a follower of Araki. The trial thus became a vehicle by which the \"Kōdōha\" was able to denounce the \"Tōseiha\", portray Aizawa as a selfless patriot, and Nagata as an unprincipled power-mad schemer.\n\nAt the climax of the Aizawa trial, to reduce tensions on the Tokyo area, the First Infantry Division was ordered from Tokyo to Manchuria. Instead, this caused the situation to escalate further, as the \"Kōdōha\" decided that the time was right for direct action, and backed the First Infantry Division in an attempted coup d'état on 26 February 1936 known as the February 26 Incident. The failure of the coup three days later resulted in the almost complete purge of \"Kōdōha\" members from top army positions and the resignation of their leader Sadao Araki.\n\nThus, after the February 26 Incident, the \"Kōdōha\" effectively ceased to exist, and the Tōseiha lost most of its \"raison d'être\". Although \"Tōseiha\" followers gained control of the army, the \"Kōdōha\" ideals of spiritual power and imperial mysticism remained embedded in the army, as did its tradition of insubordination of junior officers (gekokujō), and resurfaced with the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.\n"}

The story continues two years after Nikopol is admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Paris. Nikopol suddenly stops quoting Baudelaire after the discovery of a block of concrete, which contains the immortal body of Horus.\n\nAt the same time in London, Jill is working on an article about the Afro-Pakistian and Zuben'Ubisch minority conflicts in the suburbs of Chelsea. While working on her Script-Walker she receives a phone call from John, an Alpheratzish friend and informant. During that phone call John is murdered by four Afro-Pakistiani but before he dies, he tells Jill about an article in De Morgen. After having made her way to the phonebooth and discovered John's body, Jill returns to her hotel room where she takes two red pills of HLV, John's drug. The drug erases John from Jill's memory.\n\nMeanwhile, the news media are reporting about the block of concrete and the liberation of Horus, which was followed by the brutal murder of the workers who freed him onboard of the space vessel Europe I. Upon hearing this news, Jeff Wynatt, a friend of Jill Bioskop and former journalist, hurries towards the hotel where Jill is staying. He finds her in a deep coma and wakes her with cold water. Afterwards during a dinner in a restaurant Jeff asks Jill to cover the news of the return of Europe I, which is expected to arrive in a few days in Berlin. Jeff also says that he might visit Jill once she is in Berlin, which is something she didn't want to hear. Later that evening in the hotel room Jill uses the antenna of the scripwalker to kill Jeff. After she has cleaned up, she takes another red HLV pill to erase everything from her memory.\n\nAlcide Nikopol Jr. receives a report from his father's psychiatrist which says that Nikopol has fully recovered from his alleged mental illness, but that he hasn't accepted the fact yet. However, Nikopol is shown to cover the room observation camera while making a deal with the nurse about taking his pills for a kiss, which can be interpreted in several ways.\n\nJill travels with an air taxi to Berlin and during the flight she discovers in her pocket the news paper article that John had told her about before he was murdered. She also learns that what she is writing on her scriptwalker is printed on an old fax at the editorial office of De Morgen.\n\nThe other Egyptian gods and the pyramid are somewhere in the neighbourhood of Mars when they discover that the pyramid is missing a block of concrete. Exactly the piece of concrete which was used for Horus' punishment.\n\nJill arrives at Mauer Palast Hotel in Berlin and says goodbye to Nick, the taxi driver. When she walks through the lobby of the hotel she feels Nick's eyes. On her room she orders dinner and reviews the notes from the scriptwalker. During the night Nick tries to sneak into Jill's bed which results in another murder with the antenna of the scriptwalker followed by a red pill.\n\nThe next day Jill meets another journalist, Ivan Vabek, and they drink a cup of coffee in the bar of the hotel. Ivan tells about a conflict in Berlin called the Egg War, of which he thinks every journalist must cover at least once in his or her career. He offers Jill a front row spot and a dinner invitation. Jill accepts the invitation and is transported by a local boy to the spot where she can watch the Egg War herself.\n\nNext evening Jill tries to get access to the space port of Berlin, but everybody is denied access. The government inquires the only survivor of Europe I which is in fact controlled by Horus. Horus leaves the human body of the survivor he had taken and murders everybody who was questioning him. He finds Ivan Vabek and takes control of his body. Nikopol has followed these events with his telepathic cat and is preparing to leave the hospital and travel to Berlin. Also travelling to Berlin is John, Jill's alien friend who was murdered in the beginning of the story.\n\nDuring a dinner with Ivan, Jill notices that something has changed in him, especially his voice. While in Ivan's room, Ivan is fighting the spirit of Horus resulting in Horus leaving his body. Once more Jill is left back with another dead body and the usual red pill to erase it from her memory.\n\nNikopol arrives at the desk of Mauer Palast, and he asks for a room. Once in the room, Nikopol speaks to Horus asking him to appear. Horus appears and during a glass of champagne, they discuss an agreement.\n\nJohn is arriving in the railway station of Berlin, where the police demands him to come with them. John knocks down three police men and flees, but is shot in the back three times...\n\n\"La Femme piège\" was initially published by Dargaud in 1986, and later reissued by Les Humanoïdes Associés in 1990.

Before this date he had entered the service of Henry VII of England. In June 1499, then described as prothonotary, he went on an embassy to Louis XII of France, and on his return occupied the position of king's secretary.\n\nRuthall had a long series of ecclesiastical preferments. In 1495 he had the rectory of Bocking, Essex (whose priest is called the Dean of Bocking), in 1502 he became a prebendary of Wells, and in 1503 Archdeacon of Gloucester, Dean of Salisbury and chancellor of Cambridge. In 1505 he was made prebendary of Lincoln; Henry VII, who had already made him a privy councillor, appointed him Bishop of Durham in 1509, but Henry died before Ruthall was consecrated. Henry VIII confirmed his appointment, and continued him in the office of secretary. He was part of the skeleton council that accompanied Henry VIII to the Tower of London at the beginning of his reign, following the death of Henry VII. In 1510, with Richard Foxe and Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, he negotiated a fragile peace with France.\n\nHe went to France with the king in 1513 with a hundred men, but was sent back to England when James IV of Scotland threatened war. He took a part in the preparations for defence, strengthened Norham Castle, and wrote to Thomas Wolsey after the Battle of Flodden (1513). He was present at the marriage of Louis XII and the Princess Mary Tudor in 1514, and in 1516 was made Lord Privy Seal.\n\nIn 1518 he was present when Wolsey was made a papal legate, and was one of the commissioners when the Princess Mary was betrothed to the Dauphin, Francis III, Duke of Brittany. He was at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, and was again at Calais with Wolsey in 1521. When Buckingham was examined by the king, Ruthall was present as secretary. A hardworking official, he did a great deal of the interviewing necessary in diplomatic negotiations. Brewer represents him as Wolsey's drudge, and Giustinian speaks of his \"singing treble to the cardinal's bass.\" He died on 4 February 1523 at Durham Place, London, and was buried in St John's Chapel, Westminster Abbey.\n\nAs a benefactor he repaired the bridge at Newcastle, and built a great chamber at Bishop Auckland. He also increased the endowment of the grammar school at Cirencester which had been established by John Chedworth, in 1460. He was a patron of Erasmus.

He received the Silver Star. \n\nThe 4th Infantry Division (4th ID) occupied Coleman Kaserne from 1951 to 1956 (Most of that time was during the U.S. Occupation Zone in western Germany; the U.S. Occupation in western Germany ended on May 5, 1955). \"Combat Command B\" (CCB) of the 3rd Armored Division (3rd AD) from Fort Knox, Kentucky, moved into Coleman Kaserne on 30 June 1956, replacing the units from the 4th ID, which rotated to Fort Lewis, Washington. 3AD's Combat Command B converted to the designation, 2nd Brigade, 3rd Armored Division as part of the 1963 ROAD conversion (ROAD: Reorganization Objective Army Division, an Army initiative to reorganize the structure of their divisions). Initial ROAD-authorized battalions at Coleman Kaserne were 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor; 1st and 2nd Battalions, 48th Infantry (Mechanized) (the 1st Bn is currently a Basic Training Unit at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri); and the 2nd Battalion, 6th Field Artillery. Support units assigned to Coleman Kaserne were the 503rd Military Police and Company E, 122nd Maintenance Battalion.\n\nFollowing 3rd AD inactivation in 1992, the part of the Coleman Kaserne complex known as Coleman Village became a bedroom community for the 414th Base Support Battalion (BSB). Coleman Village then became quarters for married personnel and their families assigned to the 1st Armored Division's 1st Squadron of the 1st Cavalry Regiment aka \"The Blackhawk Squadron\", located at Armstrong Barracks in Büdingen. Shortly thereafter, however, Coleman Kaserne was returned to the German authorities and was temporarily used to house refugees seeking asylum.\n\n\n"}

Langeskov is the home of a local newspaper, Nordøstfyns Avis (\"The North-East Funen Paper\").\n\nThe municipality was created in 1970 as the result of a (\"Municipality Reform\") that merged three parishes: Birkende parish, Marslev parish, and Rønninge parish. The two former formed Marslev-Birkende municipality, while Rønninge was an independent municipality. The founders of Langeskov municipality had originally hoped that more parishes would join the new municipality, but Kølstrup chose Kerteminde municipality instead and Rolfsted joined Årslev municipality. As a result, Langeskov municipality became relatively small.\n\nLangeskov municipality ceased to exist as the result of \"Kommunalreformen\" (\"The Municipality Reform\" of 2007).

Formed 6 December 1926, the club plays in Superettan, the second tier in the Swedish Football system. Trelleborgs FF has participated 17 times in Allsvenskan and once in the UEFA Cup where the team eliminated Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–1995 season.\n\nTrelleborg have had a reputation of being a less fashionable provincial side, making the most of limited resources and a small fan base. The team has typically been recognised by performing goalkeepers, a strong defense and a good home record. In 2006 the team broke the Superettan record for longest period without conceding a goal.\n\nThe club is affiliated to the Skånes Fotbollförbund.\n\nThe club won promotion to the top Swedish league for the first time in 1984. The club's glory days arrived in the early nineties when they won promotion to Allsvenskan for the second time and finished third in 1992, the so far best placement, fourth in 1993 and participated in the UEFA-cup. Tipped for demotion at the start of most seasons, the team scrambled through the late nineties with effective, but not very attractive, defensive long ball tactics. Trelleborg's stadium, Vångavallen, was even nicknamed \"Tjongavallen\" (from Swedish \"Tjonga\" – kicking a football far away without direction). The team was finally demoted in 2001 after a disappointing season.\n\nThe club gained promotion to the top league for the third time in 2003 just to be demoted directly, since it came after the Trelleborg board hired the Dane Ole Mørk, who was supposed to change the Trelleborg style of play into a more attractive short-passing game. In 2005, TFF finished eleventh in Superettan after a turbulent year, while 2006 became a successful year for the team. Three rounds before the end of Superettan 2006, Trelleborg stood as clear winners, thus gaining promotion to the 2007 Allsvenskan. Relegation was narrowly avoided with superior goal difference in 2007. In 2008 Tom Prahl, trainer during the success years in the early nineties, returned as head coach. Trelleborg finished at tenth place in an even season where Rasmus Bengtsson amongst others had an inspiring season. In 2009 the team finished at ninth place after a strong finish. In 2010 the teams tactics changed to a more creative and public friendly game style. The team finished fifth after a strong autumn, their best position since 1993, just to be relegated in 2011, after conceding 64 goals in 16 matches and finishing second last. In 2012, Trelleborg was relegated from Superettan, and the following year they failed to re-qualify for Superettan by finishing third place in Division 1 (Swedish football). In 2014 they only avoided getting relegated from Division 1 (Swedish football) through goal difference, however, the next year they won the league and therefore qualified for the 2016 Superettan in which they finished third place and qualified for playoffs against Jönköpings Södra IF where they won 3-1 in aggregate and were promoted to Allsvenskan after a 6-year hiatus.\n\n\n"}

He graduated with a degree in agricultural education from North Carolina State College in 1954, and served in the United States Army for two years. He obtained a master's degree specializing in agricultural economics from N.C. State University. There, he was influenced by the Chicago school of economics, which confirmed his criticisms of government intervention in agriculture. He then enrolled in a PhD program at Michigan State University, where the influence of the Chicago school of economics was much less pronounced. He obtained his PhD in agricultural economics in 1963.\n\nAfter teaching as an assistant and associate professor of economics and business at North Carolina State University, Pasour took a sabbatical at the University of Chicago. His view of economics soon began to change, first being influenced by public choice economists, emphasizing the incentives of government decision-makers versus private entrepreneurs, and then by Austrian economists, emphasizing the role of the entrepreneur in the market process. After reading further Austrian works, such as James Buchanan's \"Cost and Choice\" and various articles by Friedrich Hayek, Pasour began to apply Austrian and public choice concepts to his work in agricultural economics. He formed the view that Government regulators cannot do what they profess to do–even when they have the best intentions–because they cannot obtain the relevant information to do so. This view was very different from the mainstream at the time.\n\nPasour would go on to publish articles in various market-oriented publications, including \"The Freeman\", \"The Intercollegiate Review\", and \"Reason magazine\". He was invited to give a talk at the \"Freedom in Third Century in America\" seminar in 1982, where he was formally identified with the discipline of Austrian economics. In 1983 he became a member of the board of advisers for the Journal of Austrian Economics.\n\nIn 1986 he participated in a summer seminar at the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE), where he shared a manuscript on U.S. agricultural policy. FEE edited and published the manuscript for use in a national high school debate program soon after. Pasour was awarded a Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge Leavey Award for Excellence in Private Enterprise Education in 1989, which was in large part due to the manuscript. The manuscript was later expanded and published as \"Agriculture & the State: Market Processes & Bureaucracy\" in 1990.\n"}

She herself was an impoverished descendant of the Valois royal family through an illegitimate son of King Henry II. She is known for her prominent role in the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, one of many scandals that led to the French Revolution and helped to destroy the monarchy of France.\n\nJeanne de Valois was born on 22 July 1756 in Fontette (northeastern France near Bar-sur-Aube) to a very poor family. Her father, Jacques de Valois de Saint-Rémy (1717–1762), was in a direct male-line descendant of Count Henry de Saint-Rémy (1557–1621), an illegitimate son of King Henry II and Nicole de Savigny; despite having royal Valois blood, Jacques was known as a drunkard and to live from expedients. Jeanne's mother was Marie Jossel, a debauched court servant girl.\n\nJeanne was the third of six children. Three of Jacques de Valois de Saint-Rémy and Marie Jossel's six children died in infancy: Joseph (9 March 1753 – 9 December 1753), Marie Marguerite Anne (17 February 1759 – 23 May 1767) and Jean (5 March 1760 – 9 March 1760). The three surviving de Valois de Saint-Rémy children, Jacques (25 July 1751 – 1785), Jeanne, and Marie-Anne (2 October 1757 – 1786) were neglected, went barefoot, tended the cows, and often found it necessary to beg for food. According to Count Beugnot as written in his \"Mémoires\", they were rescued by his father and the abbot of Langres. According to another source, the family moved to Boulogne near Paris where a priest and one of his rich parishioners, Madame de Boulainvilliers, took care of them.\n\nIn any case, their Valois ancestry was ascertained by a genealogist at Versailles, and as a result of legal dispositions set up to help children from poor nobility, Jacques was granted a yearly stipend of 1000 pounds and a post in a military academy; Jeanne and Marie-Anne went to a boarding school in Passy and were given a stipend of 900 pounds. They were supposed to become nuns in the Longchamps monastery, but instead chose to go back to Bar-sur-Aube where they lived with the Surmont family. On 6 June 1780, Jeanne married Marc-Antoine-Nicolas de la Motte, Mr Surmont's nephew and an officer of the gendarmes. At the time of her wedding, Jeanne was heavily pregnant; only one month later (7 July) her newborn twins were baptized as Jean-Baptiste and Nicolas-Marc de la Motte. Both children lived only a few days.\n\nWhile the de la Motte family's claim to nobility was dubious, both husband and wife assumed the title \"comte\" and \"comtesse\" de La Motte Valois. Of the three siblings, Jeanne would be the only one to achieve notoriety. Jacques died on military duty on Saint-Louis Island; Marie-Anne went back to religious life. None of the three Saint-Rémy children had living descendants.\n\nWhen it became clear that Nicolas was unable to meet the couple's financial needs to maintain them in the extravagant style that his wife avidly desired, Jeanne resolved to ask a more generous pension from the royal family due to her royal blood. She decided to approach Marie Antoinette as she felt the Queen, being a woman, would be more sympathetic to her plight; Jeanne therefore made frequent visits to Versailles in the hope of catching the Queen's attention. At that time, any ordinary citizen dressed in suitable attire could enter the palace and its gardens, and observe the royal family. Nevertheless, Marie-Antoinette had been told of Jeanne's questionable lifestyle and refused to meet her.\n\nThe marriage between Jeanne and her husband was unsuccessful although they continued to live together. Jeanne took a lover, Rétaux de Villette, a common gigolo and Nicolas's fellow officer in the gendarmerie. Around 1783, she met Cardinal Prince Louis de Rohan. The thoroughly unscrupulous Jeanne quickly became his mistress and confidante. As a result, she became aware that the Prince wanted nothing more than to win Marie Antoinette's approval. Nevertheless, the Queen shunned the Cardinal because he had attempted to thwart her marriage to Louis XVI and she was aware of his scandalous and venial lifestyle.\n\nJeanne was described as having been slender with small breasts; she had white skin, chestnut-brown hair, limpid blue eyes, and a \"winning smile\". The Abbé Georgel, Cardinal de Rohan's loyal servant, describes Jeanne as having \"the wiles of a Circe.\" She was fully prepared to use them to her advantage. She obtained some money from the Cardinal, and a commission for her husband in the Comte d'Artois's bodyguard. But these were not enough to enable the de la Mottes to live in the princely state that Jeanne aspired to.\n\nAt the same time, the jeweler Charles Auguste Boehmer was trying to sell a particularly expensive and luxurious diamond necklace originally designed for Madame du Barry. He had invested a fortune into this piece of jewelry and had to sell it fast to avoid bankruptcy. He soon realized that only the King could possibly buy such an item, but Louis XVI and the Queen refused the necklace.\n\nJeanne, with the active help of her husband and de Villette, concocted a plan to use this situation to their financial advantage. Rétaux de Villette was a master forger and wrote letters from 'the Queen' to the \"comtesse\". In the fake letters, the Queen stated that she wanted the necklace, but was aware of the reluctance of the King to buy it due to the current dismal financial situation of the country. She hoped that the Cardinal could lend her the money as a secret favor. Jeanne de la Motte was named as the Queen's agent. The Cardinal believed these letters to be authentic and agreed to buy the necklace for the Queen. The Cardinal knew very well that the Queen never met Jeanne in public, but believed that she was her trusted agent due to a secret liaison. A late night rendezvous was arranged, where the Cardinal met 'the Queen' (in reality a prostitute who resembled her, called Nicole le Guay d'Oliva) and received forgiveness. The jeweler was contacted and asked to bring the necklace. \n\nThe necklace was given to Jeanne de la Motte to pass on to the Queen. Her husband promptly began selling the diamonds in Paris and London. The affair came to light only when the Cardinal was arrested. Also soon arrested were Jeanne de la Motte, Rétaux de Villette, Nicole d'Oliva, and Count Cagliostro, a self-proclaimed holy man of whom the Cardinal was a patron, and whom Jeanne accused of being the one who persuaded the Cardinal to purchase the necklace. \"Comte\" Nicholas de la Motte stayed in London. \n\nWhile they were not directly implicated and could have tried the swindlers without publicity, the King and the Queen insisted on a public trial to defend their honor. \n\nNevertheless, the trial actually had the opposite effect and destroyed the reputation of the Queen, because the public saw her as the guilty party. The Cardinal was found not guilty and acquitted. King Louis XVI promptly had him exiled to one of the Cardinal's own properties in southern France. Rétaux de Villette was found guilty of forgery and exiled. Nicole d'Oliva was acquitted. Count Cagliostro, though acquitted, was exiled from France by order of the King. Jeanne de la Motte was found guilty and sentenced to be whipped, branded and imprisoned. The public sympathized with her. She was condemned to prison for life in the Salpêtrière, but soon escaped disguised as a boy and made her way to London where, in 1789, she published her memoirs entitled \"Memoires Justificatifs de La Comtesse de Valois de La Motte\", which attempted to justify her actions while casting blame upon her chief victim, Marie Antoinette.\n\nThe Cardinal survived the revolution and lived out his life in exile. Rétaux de Villette also lived and died in exile in Italy. Nicole d'Oliva faded into obscurity and died at age 28. Count Cagliostro was imprisoned during the Roman Inquisition and died in prison.

The term came into common usage in self-reference to the large ethnic Chinese migrant population in Southeast Asia, and is contrasted with \"Xiyang\" (), which refers to the Western world, \"Dongyang\" (), which refers to Japan, and \"Beiyang\" (), which refers to Russia. The Chinese press regularly uses the term to refer to the region stretching from Yunnan Province to Singapore (north to south) and from Myanmar (Burma) to Vietnam (west to east); in addition, the term also refers to Brunei, East Malaysia, East Timor, Indonesia and the Philippines in the region it encompasses.\n\nThe alternative term, \"Great Golden Peninsula\", came into common usage due to the large number of Chinese migrants – attempting to escape the reach of the oppressive Manchu Emperors – it received. The Chinese, especially those from the southeastern seaboard, also ventured to the region to engage in trade. The Nanyang was extremely important in the trading business and one of China’s main trading partners in early years; it encompassed three main trading routes: one through Myanmar (Burma), one through Vietnam and lastly one through Laos.\n\nWaves of Chinese emigration from mainland China, also referred to as the Chinese diaspora, to The Great Golden Peninsula and other regions have occurred several times through the course of history. The first wave of emigration came as a result of the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, the ruling dynasty in China that followed the collapse of the Yuan dynasty and ruled for 276 years. The migrants opposed the Manchu seizure of power in Beijing and migrated to establish overseas Chinese communities throughout the Nanyang region. This led to Chinese control of large parts of the region’s economy and means of production.\n\nThe second wave started as a form of escaping the oppressive control exerted by the Manchu Emperors of the Qing dynasty, the last imperial dynasty of China ruling from 1644 to 1911. After the Taiping Rebellion and alternative upheavals that resulted in the disintegration of China, warlords ruptured the country into lawless fiefdoms, leading to an expansion of the Chinese communities in the Nanyang.\n\nThe Mekong River, gathering its strength in the Yunnan province and flowing south into the Nanyang nations of Burma, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam before spilling into the South China Sea, was an extremely important facilitator of the Chinese Diaspora. It became known, not as a nourishing and life-giving river, but as the leading channel out of China for illegal migrants.\n\nMore recently, the third wave of migrants to the Nanyang – coming from all over China – has led to, arguably, more profound economic and social impacts than waves in the past. Better overland routes and air travel, along with the more relaxed Chinese emigration regulations of 1979 and China’s economic reform and opening up of its economy in 1980, have facilitated the process of migration and led the Chinese into a search for business opportunities in the Great Golden Peninsula.\n\nThe Great Golden Peninsula has benefitted greatly from Chinese immigration. Economic opportunity, commerce in particular, brought the Chinese to the Nanyang, and involvement in commercial activities is a common characteristic amongst Chinese minorities in the region. These Chinese family businesses and the Chinese population of the Nanyang can be characterized as the driving force behind economic growth and capitalism of the region.\n\nSince the period after 1850, the Chinese have come to dominate small business in the major cities of the Nanyang. They tended not only to own the shops, but hire mostly Chinese workers, increasing the scope and power of the Chinese influence. These business are distinguished by high level of centralization, most of the decision-making relies on the owner-manager; absence of bureaucratic regulation, yielding a fluid organizational structure; an autocratic and paternalistic leadership style; existence of preferential treatment combined with extensive family ties of obligation of duty; and finally, a customized network of external links. These features set them apart from other businesses in the Nanyang and allowed them to thrive due to the entrepreneurial talent they demonstrated.\n\nBecause the business industry for the Nanyang-Chinese seemed extremely prosperous, most of the Chinese immigrants strove to acquaint themselves with the shopkeepers and attempted to learn and eventually master trade in the hopes that they too would eventually gain entry to business in the Nanyang. This allowed for the continuation of business-creation by the Chinese arriving in the region.\n\nThe overseas Chinese of the Great Golden Peninsula play extremely significant roles in the region; in particular, involved with trade and commerce, mining and commercial agriculture. One of the main benefits the Chinese merchants brought to the Nanyang region is a more prominent relationship with the United States and other Pacific countries due to the strong link these merchants foster with foreign countries. The Nanyang Chinese continue to be vibrant elements in their newfound homes.\n\nDespite pogroms and discrimination against the Chinese in the Nanyang, especially where they constituted the minorities, the region still remains economically attractive to them. Pockets of settled Chinese communities continue to testify to the attractiveness of the Great Golden Peninsula.\n\nAlthough China has positive impacts in the Nanyang region, in more recent years (since the early 1980s), China’s continuous success with its open-door policy and export-oriented development strategy has started to cast a shadow on economies of the Great Golden Peninsula that must compete with China in attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and in manufactured products to the same markets.\n\nChina's chief interest in the region of the Great Golden Peninsula was the expansion of its economic activities, namely trade. Foreign trade has been a very significant factor in maintaining stability and in contributing to growth in China. Chinese merchants were constantly pushing south as trade with Burma thrived. The Chinese province of Yunnan – where the Mekong River, previously used for illegal migration, flows - is China's main avenue for trade with the Nanyang. Yunnan is a landlocked province that possesses a well-developed industrial base with cheap labor and a fast-growing economy. Its proximity to the Nanyang region has been complemented by its remoteness from Beijing's control – the region was the last stronghold of anti-communist forces. It has for years sought a foreign market for its goods and an outlet to sea; due to the ideal conditions described above and its easy access to the Mekong River, it has begun gaining access to the several markets of the Nanyang, particularly Burma and Laos.\n\nAnother main avenue for Chinese trade with the Great Golden Peninsula is the South China Sea; it was the main route for trade in commodities and ideas, and even named the second Silk Route. Trade flows between China and the Nanyang were characterized by exports of manufactured or processed goods from China and exports of raw materials and food – particularly rice – from the Nanyang.\n\nMore recently, Singapore developed into the center of trade between the two regions; it became the base for Chinese activity in the Nanyang. Singapore was not only a main source of capital for overseas Chinese in the Nanyang but it also handled Chinese human cargo by ‘sorting’ it according to their skills and sturdiness.\n\nThe Nanyang region has been in the Chinese cultural sphere of influence for an extended period of time. Therefore, the rise in the role and influence of the ethnic Chinese is extremely important for the understanding of the region. The Chinese philosophy, religion, political philosophies, governmental standards and overall way of life have been transferred to the Great Golden Peninsula.\n\nOne of the many examples of China's influence over the region is the Chinese Lunar New Year, commonly referred to as “Chinese New Year”. It is celebrated and is an official public holiday in many countries of the Nanyang region (Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines). Another prominent example is the original roots of the people in the region; a significant portion of the population of the Nanyang region originated in China, especially when it comes to Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Singapore.\n\nMore specifically, Chinese influence in Thailand is seen in a rise in Thai-Chinese power, not only in commerce and business but also in politics, bureaucracy and intelligentsia. In Indonesia, some news bulletins are in Mandarin, whilst in Singapore, one of the four official languages is Mandarin. Vietnam has been following the 'China model' politically and economically; like in China, Vietnamese from overseas have led and been the most significant contributors of the economic recovery of the country. Malaysia experiences Chinese cultural influence through Chinese tycoons; they play a prominent role in leading the economic boom and inspire reforms to Malaysia’s Malay supremacy policy.\n\nThe anti-Chinese sentiment of the Nanyang has subsided in recent years as Chinese influence results in prosperous rather than communist results. This has generated amongst many Nanyang-Chinese the will to rediscover their cultural identity in line with the emerging China of the north. One of the impacts of this rediscovery in the Nanyang region, is a boom in Mandarin classes.\n\n\n"}

It was then performed by the Skylight Opera Theatre in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the Boston Lyric Opera with Jeffrey Walter as the Little Prince. Houston Grand Opera had a return engagement in December 2004 with Jeffrey Walter as the Little Prince and Jeffrey Allison. It was then performed at the University of Kentucky opera (April 2005), the New York City Opera (November 2005), Tulsa Opera, and the Santa Fe Opera. The San Francisco Opera and Cal Performances did a joint production at Zellerbach Hall in May 2008. Ithaca College Opera also put on a production in February and March 2010.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it was filmed by the BBC following a nationwide talent search for children to play the roles of the Prince, the Rose and a chorus of thirty-six vocalists. Over 25,000 children applied, with over 6,500 taking part in auditions. The television show \"Blue Peter\" documented the search for the singers, and filmed their training and rehearsals. \"The Little Prince\" was broadcast on BBC Two on Saturday, 27 November 2004 at 7:30 PM.\n\nThe opera requires 2 flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), 1 oboe (doubling English horn), 2 clarinets (2nd doubling bass clarinet), 1 bassoon (doubling contrabassoon), 1 trumpet, 1 horn, 1 trombone, 2 percussionists, celesta, harp, string section. A performance lasts for about 1 hour 35 minutes.\n\nFollowing the television broadcast, BBC in conjunction with Sony Classical released a double-CD and DVD of the complete production of \"The Little Prince\" in November 2004. Upon release, the CD set entered the classical charts.; the publication includes the 74-page libretto, containing photographs from the opera and illustrations from the original book. It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios.\n\nCharles Ward of the \"Houston Chronicle\" termed the production \"unfailingly attractive—simple, communicative, touching\" with the production \"tantalizingly close to a major operatic success.\" Bernard Holland of the \"New York Times\" wrote \"Charming as Maria Bjornson's sets and costumes are and as nicely handled as Francesca Zambello's direction is, they depend on Nicholas Wright's inventive rhyming to give them life. Lighting (by Rick Fisher) becomes as important as Rachel Portman's music. It is hard to say whose opera this is; it is perhaps collective: modest parts exceeded by their sum.\" T.J. Medrek of the \"Boston Herald\" found the musical setting of the opera \"full of warmth, wisdom and generous lyric beauty. But the production by director Francesca Zambello and designer Maria Bjornson is so thoroughly enchanting that, given the choice, there's no question that you should opt for the DVD version.\"\n\n"}

He was son of Reverend John Rowan and the former Margaret Stewart and had eight brothers and three sisters. Although it is not known when Rowan emigrated to North Carolina, it is recorded that Rowan lived in Bath in 1726, serving as a church warden. In addition, he was a merchant and shipbuilding in the colony. In 1727, Rowan joined the assembly in 1727 to the executive council in 1731, where he worked between 1734 and 1760 (date of his death). In 1735 Rowan worked in the survey of \"the boundary line between North and South Carolina\" with other men, being appointed surveyor-general of North Carolina.\n\nHe was appointed President of the Council and acting governor of North Carolina in 1753, following the death of governor Nathaniel Rice. He remained in the charge until 1754. Matthew Rowan died April, 1760. He is buried on the Brunswick County plantation.\n\nMatthew Rowan married Elizabeth, the widow of his brother John, in 1742, although they had no children (while she had four daughters). Rowan did father one child, John Rowan, with Jane Stubbs; he acknowledged his paternity and remembered John in his will. Matthew Rowan mainly lived in the Lower Cape Fear, near the Brunswick County community (modern Northwest), where he lived in North Carolina.\n\nIn 1753, the area that had previously been the northern part of Anson County was formed into Rowan County, named in his honor.\n\nPurportedly, Rowan was captain of an unregistered 90 foot 2 masted ship named Martha & Eliza which wrecked on Grand Manon Island, The Bay of Fundy in 1741 carrying Presbyterian Irish expatriates. He abandoned the survivors but later returned to recover cargo from the wrecked ship. \"Several weeks later, at the end of November, the crew returned in a small sloop and schooner to plunder the ship. Apparently, Rowan wanted the valuable cargo but felt no responsibility to save the lives of his passengers. The complaint in the Massachusetts archives states that, “At the time the sloop and schooner came for us, the hands aboard — our mate and others — for reasons best known to themselves, were quite unwilling to land or search for these, though we had seen them that very day on the shore searching for food and eating rockweed, and so left them. Of these we can give no further account.”\n\nThe survivors asked for help: “Now, besides these already mentioned that came first aboard the vessel at Londonderry, there is but 48 of us know. In brief, many died at sea and many after we came to land, the corps [corpses]of which lie many of them on the shore, through weakness we were not able to interr them.” The rescue vessel took 48 people to Pleasant Point in Cushing, and Captain Rowan and his henchmen stripped survivors of whatever money and possessions they still had, as payment for their rescue. The complaint continues saying that even some of their clothes were taken, “to leave us almost naked.”\n\nBut the Cushing residents, many of whom had come from Northern Ireland themselves, were warm and generous to the new arrivals. It being winter, however, they couldn’t support 48 newcomers for long, so they sent an appeal to provincial officials, signed by Alexander Campbell and William Lunnen. The letter clearly informed them of Rowen’s abuses, and the Massachusetts House of Representatives wasted no time in authorizing provisions for the survivors. A treasurer for Massachusetts Bay Colony reported 250 pounds spent for “sundry provisions sent in the County Sloop to the poor sufferers that were cast ashore at St. George.”\n\nThere is no record that Massachusetts ever sent the promised relief to the survivors, or that it sought to bring Captain Rowen to justice. Thirteen years later, Rowen turns up as governor of North Carolina.\"\n"}
{"id": "1825560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825560", "title": "Communist Party of Venezuela", "text": "Communist Party of Venezuela\n\nThe Communist Party of Venezuela (, PCV) is a communist party and the oldest continuously existing party in Venezuela. It remained the main leftist political party in Venezuela from its foundation in 1931 until it split into rival factions in 1971. Unlike other communist parties, it uses a rooster in its logo.\n\nThe PCV was founded in 1931 as a clandestine organization during the military dictatorship of Juan Vicente Gómez. It was initially led by and . The PCV became the Venezuelan affiliate of the Communist International. A forerunner of the PCV, the Venezuelan Revolutionary Party, had been founded in exile in Mexico in 1926 and attempted a rebellion in Venezuela in 1929.\n\nThe PCV remained an illegal organization until 1941, when it entered into an alliance with the progressive military regime of Isaías Medina Angarita, following orders from Comintern for communist parties throughout the world to support governments that aided the allied war effort. During this time it published the weekly newspaper \"¡Aquí Está!\". The PCV was outlawed during the conservative military dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez (1948–1958), when it played a key role in organizing the clandestine resistance to the regime, alongside activist from the (also banned) party Democratic Action.\n\nIn 1952, despite remaining an illegal organization, PCV provided key support to the non-communist leftist party URD in elections organized by the military regime to legitimize its rule. When URD's election victory became apparent, the military ordered the ballot counting process stopped and refused to accept its defeat at the hands of the communist-supported opposition. The episode shifted the balance of power in the military from relative moderates to the hard-line faction led by Marcos Pérez Jiménez, which substantially stepped up efforts to repress the clandestine opposition.\n\nIn 1958, the three main non-communist opposition parties (Accion Democratica, COPEI and URD) made a conscious choice to exclude PCV from the power-sharing agreement, (the Punto Fijo Pact) that would underpin the transition to democracy.\n\nAppearing on a Venezuelan election ballot for the first time in the 1958 election, PCV backed the candidacy of URD's Wolfgang Larrazábal and received 3.2% of the vote (84,451 votes), contributing towards Larrazábal's total of 34.88%. The figure understates the party's influence in Venezuelan politics at the time, which stemmed less from its mass support than from its highly disciplined internal organization, including many full-time party organizers, and its ideological and financial ties to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the early 1960s, inspired by the Cuban Revolution, the party became much more radical and launched a guerrilla war against the newly elected AD government led by Rómulo Betancourt, causing it to be outlawed once more. The PCV guerrilla effort was unable to mobilize substantial support from the Venezuelan peasantry, which largely supported Betancourt's reformism, and was unable to mount a serious military challenge to the new regime. Disillusioned with the guerrilla experience, the majority of PCV members split away from the party in 1971 to enter electoral politics as part of the reformist Movement toward Socialism (MAS). At the same time, a much smaller group of activists split off to form the trade-union based party La Causa Radical, better known as Causa R, a forerunner of today's Patria Para Todos party. Remaining communist fighters were later given a general amnesty by President Rafael Caldera as part of his \"pacificacion\" process.\n\nIn the following years, the PCV became a marginal force in Venezuelan politics. The party received 0.7% of the national vote in the 1973 elections, 0.5% in the 1978 election, 1% in 1983, and 0.3% in both the 1988 and 1993 elections: with its high-water mark coming in 1983, with 67,681 votes.\n\nIn the 1993 presidential elections, the PCV endorsed Rafael Caldera, a member of the Convergencia alliance. PCV broke with President Caldera in 1996.\n\nIn the presidential elections of 1998, the PCV backed Hugo Chávez adding 81,979 votes (1.25% of the national vote) to Chávez's total of 3,673,685 votes. In the 2006 presidential election, the PCV ticket received 2.9% of the National vote, contributing a haul of 342,227 to Chávez's total of 7,309,080 votes. These results make PCV the 4th largest party in the Chávez coalition.\n\nIn the presidential elections of 2012, PCV again backed Chavez. Its ticket contributed 3.28% of the National vote, making PCV the second largest party in the Chavez coalition. The PCV won 1.6% in the 2013 municipal elections, up from 1.4% in the 2008 municipal elections.\n\nThe PCV has articulated its belief that the transition to socialism in Venezuela will be slow and evolutionary. The party remains a small but vocal part of the Chávez governing coalition.\n\nFollowing the December 2005 legislative election, eight PCV members were elected as deputies to the National Assembly:\n\nIn the 2018 Venezuelan presidential election, the PCV endorsed Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe PCV publishes \"Debate Abierto\" (Open Debate), edited by Dr Carolus Wimmer, and \"Tribuna Popular\" (Popular Tribune). The youth wing of PCV is \"Juventud Comunista de Venezuela\" (Communist Youth of Venezuela).\n\n"}

According to the 2011 census results, the municipality has a population of 27,110 inhabitants.\n\nThe municipality is located in the lower northern part of Šumadija, southeast of the Belgrade, with an elevation spanning from 140 meters to 364 meters. Most of the municipal territory belongs to the drainage area of the Turija river, right tributary of the Peštan river, which in turn flows into the Kolubara, thus whole area geographically gravitates to the Kolubara region. The cultural festival, \"Barlet\" (Barajevo summer) is held annually in Barajevo.\n\nBarajevo got the status of municipality in 1956 and immediately became administratively part of the wider Belgrade area. In 1957, a nearby municipality of Beljina was annexed to Barajevo, and in 1960 Umka municipality has been divided between Čukarica and Barajevo (villages of Meljak and Vranić).\n\nThe settlement of Barajevo is still statistically classified as a rural settlement. Its population is growing by even higher rate than the municipality as a whole. It is located east of the 'Parcanski vis' hill, northern part of the Kosmaj mountain, in the valley of the Beljanica river (or Barajevska reka; Cyrillic: Бељаница or Барајевска река), a tributary to the Turija river.\n\nMany outer settlements and hamlets are built as Barajevo grows and stretches in all directions making one continuous built-up are with the neighboring settlements (Guncati, Baćevac, Lisović, Boždarevac, Guberevac in Sopot municipality): Bela Reka, Dražanovac, Dubrave, Gaj (a separate local community with a population of 1,930 in 2002), Glumčevo Brdo (a separate local community, split after the 2002 census), Karaula, Nenadovac, Pajšuma, Ravni Gaj, Srednji Kraj, Stara Lipovica, Suva Šuma, Trebež (the industrial zone), Vitkovica.\n\nThe municipality of Barajevo covers an area of 213 km² and includes 13 settlements, all of which are statistically classified as rural and not urban, including the settlement of Barajevo:\nIt also includes various sub-settlements and hamlets spawning around the central settlements:\n\nAccording to the 2011 census results, the municipality of Barajevo has a population of 27,110 inhabitants.\n\nThe ethnic composition of the municipality:\nThe economy of the municipality is not much developed. Being an agricultural area, Barajevo has a mill, large orchard farm, a veterinarian station and the hunting & forestry company of Lipovička šuma. Wheat, barley, oats and corn are being grown. Industry is based on the small construction and electronic companies and the ball bearing factory.\n\nTwo major traffic routes, the Ibar Highway and the railway Belgrade-Bar (Montenegro), are passing through the municipal territory. The settlement itself was further away, but as it grew, it reached the railway.\n\nThere are two game hunting grounds in the municipality: \"Lipovička Šuma\", which extends into the municipality of Čukarica, and \"Barajevska Reka\".\n\nOne of only three officially designated campsites in Belgrade by 2018 is located in the municipality, in the village of Baćevac.

One of the exhibits is the kayak which was used by Matija Ljubek and Mirko Nišović when they won a gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Sports fishing is developed as the lake is populated with a lots of fish: common bream, common roach, Prussian carp, common rudd, common carp, zander, northern pike, wels catfish and grass carp.

By the 1970s he was a leading figure in American defense industries. \"If it moves, we probably made something on it,\" was his boast.\n\nBorn in Boston, Massachusetts, where his father was a contractor, Willard attended public schools before attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for three years. In 1909-1915 he was the chief engineer for several small companies. In 1915, he moved to Cleveland, Ohio, becoming manager of a company making axles for automobiles and trucks. During World War I, he was a civilian specialist in the Motor Transport Division of the Army Quartermaster Corps. In 1919, he started his first company in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He sold it to the Timken-Detroit Axle Company 1928, staying on as its manager, and also a director of Timken. He became president of Timken in 1933-40, and chairman of the board 1940-53. During World War II, it produced 80 percent of the axles for large army trucks, and 75 percent of the armor plate for tanks.\n\nSimultaneously he was president of several smaller companies. By 1947, his combined enterprises had 5,000 employees in 15 plants, with sales of over $62 million. He merged them into Timken in 1953 to form the Rockwell Spring and Axle Company, of which he was chairman of the board. In 1958, his conglomerate was renamed the Rockwell Standard Corporation, and became one of the largest suppliers of parts to the automobile and truck industry. It produced a wide variety of automobile parts, such as transmissions, gears, springs, bumpers, and especially axles for trucks, buses, streetcars, tractors and other motorized vehicles. Rockwell was always an engineer at heart; He received several patents, such as one in 1926 for an \"improved double reduction and reversing differential axle construction especially useful for bus axles.\"\n\nRockwell became interested in aviation after the war, and produced a wide variety of engine parts, as well as a small executive aircraft. Expanding beyond transportation, his companies made meters for the gas and water industries. He also made power tools, valves, taxi meters, and parking meters. For example, the Pittsburgh Equitable Meter and Manufacturing Company was a conglomerate, comprising many companies that manufactured items ranging from water meters to ball bearings.\n\nThe company became a major player in the space race of the 1960s. In 1967 Rockwell-Standard merged with North American Aviation, becoming North American-Rockwell, and Rockwell stepped down as chairman. It was renamed Rockwell International in 1973. and was became the prime contractor on the space shuttle. Sales reached $6.3 billion in 1979, ranking it number 11 in defense contracts, in addition to its major presence in commercial aircraft, electronics, automotive components.\n\nNumerous major corporations brought Rockwell onto their boards, including banks, insurance companies, and railroads.\n\nRockwell came from a Yankee family and married Clara Thayer, a descendant of John Alden who arrived aboard the \"Mayflower\" in 1620. The couple had five children, Kay, Janet, Willard, Jr., Eleanor, and Betty. He was a Baptist and Republican. He brought his son Willard Frederick \"Al\" Rockwell, Jr. (1914-1992) into the network of family businesses in 1947. Rockwell Jr. became a senior executive for several of them before taking over in the mid-1960s, leading work on the NASA Apollo and Space Shuttle programs until his 1989 retirement. Willard Sr. also brought his brother Walter F. Rockwell (1899-1973) into the family business, making him president of Timken-Detroit Axle 1933 to 1953, as well as other roles.\n\n\n\n"}

Previous non-flash memory designs would lose all stored data in the event of a power loss. \"NVFS\" is a derivative of Flash Memory, which continually stores all data even when no power is applied. palmOne invented NVFS in response to complaints that a handheld's data was destroyed when the battery power ran out. In the past, it was necessary to keep the handheld continuously charged to avoid losing data, since all information was stored in volatile memory.\n\nA similar feature has been adopted by PDAs running the Windows Mobile 5.0 operating system, and is named \"Persistent Storage\".\n\nNVFS uses NAND flash memory technology to retain the handheld's data in the event of a battery swap or if the battery runs out of power. palmOne claims that Flash memory is a plus for the majority of their consumers since many of them do not want to charge the handheld too often, and it consumes less overall power. NVFS uses a brand-new data architecture which might render incompatible some applications which ran very well with non-NVFS handhelds.\n\nBecause the NVFS File System was designed to use clusters of 512 byte blocks, power users have complained that files take approximately 33% more space than in volatile file systems. In fact a volatile file system uses a block size of only 14 bytes, compared to the NVFS File System minimum block size of 512 bytes. palmOne responded to this complaint by offering a free 128 megabyte SD Card on request to selected customers . At the NVFS Early Release, Palm (at the time palmOne) would commit itself to work on a ROM Flash Update to reduce the overhead of the NVFS Architecture. Currently Palm-branded products using NVFS should be shipped with the NVFS Fix already installed. (The Tungsten E2 uses 4kb blocks.) (It is recommended those having earlier versions of the Palm Treo 650 and Tungsten T5 install the NVFS Fix at the earliest possible convenience). Such controversy gave the Tungsten T5 and the Treo 650 unfavorable remarks from power users.\n\npalmOne released the first Sprint Treo 650 Updater which was designed to ensure that the block size overhead was reduced from 512 bytes to 16-32 bytes (Usually 32 bytes, but can be as low as 16 bytes depending on the file's demand), resulting in drastic memory management efficiency improvements of the NVFS File System. A second update to the Sprint Treo 650 was released on June 16, 2005. The Unlocked GSM Firmware Upgrade was also released on the day of the second Sprint Treo 650 firmware update which also improves the efficiency of the NVFS File System in addition to addressing known problems prior to the release of the firmware update. The Rogers Wireless Treo 650 Firmware Update was quietly posted at the Rogers Wireless Treo 650 support site, and shares the same bug fixes and NVFS memory efficiency updates as with the unlocked GSM version. The initial release of the palmOne Tungsten E2, Verizon Wireless Treo 650 and the Earthlink Wireless Treo 650 already has the NVFS Memory System problems assessed.\n\nAccording to Palm Info Center on June 22, 2005, the palmOne Tungsten T5 Version 1.1 Update fixes the NVFS File System Inefficiency Problem since its release on November 2004. The Version 1.1 Update also updates the Tungsten T5's Version Number to Garnet 5.4.8.\n\nOn July 25, 2005, the Cingular Treo 650 Fix was officially released, with one of the fixes being addressing inefficiency problems associated with the NVFS File System. Cingular Treo 650 holders are encouraged to deploy this Flash ROM Update at the earliest time possible.\n\n\n"}

It consists of a pool of lymph, blood and other body fluids trapped beneath the skin. If punctured, it suppurates a dark fluid. Sometimes the fluids are cut off from the rest of the body and dry up, leaving behind dead cell material inside the blister with a texture like putty. Some blood blisters can be extremely painful due to bruising where the blister occurred.\n\nThere are also blood blister-like aneurysms as these are known to be located in the supraclinoid internal carotid artery and have been recognized as having unique pathological and clinical features.\n\nBlood blisters are commonly caused by accidents in which the skin is pinched by a tool, mechanism, or heavy weight without protective equipment. Blood blisters can also arise from forcible human contact, including grappling.\n\nBlood blisters also may occur with friction caused by constant rubbing of skin against a surface. Because of this, baseball pitchers, rowers, and drummers often contract blood blisters on the fingers and palms. They also form as a result of frostbite.\n\nBlood blisters can also occur in the mouth for a variety of reasons including side effects to certain medications, nutritional deficiencies, and mouth injuries.\n\nThere are several methods of healing blood blisters, including elevation of the wound combined with application of a cold pack, and application of padded dressings or splints.\n\n"}

He bats and throws right-handed.\n\nWilson played high school baseball for Thousand Oaks High School in Thousand Oaks, California. He later played for two seasons at Oxnard Junior College, the same baseball program that produced major leaguers Terry Pendleton, Josh Towers, Paul McAnulty, among others. He was coached by Pat Woods, Jon Larsen, Roger Frash and Buster Staniland.\n\nWilson was originally selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the amateur draft, but was dealt to the Pittsburgh Pirates in for Jason Christiansen.\n\nWilson was dealt to the Pittsburgh Pirates in for Jason Christiansen. He made his major league debut a year later.\n\nWilson had almost identical seasons in and , hitting .252 with 22 doubles in 147 games and .256, 21, 150, respectively.\n\nWilson enjoyed the finest season of his career in as he set career highs in almost every category. He posted a .308 average, shared the league lead in triples with 12 (along with Jimmy Rollins), scored 82 runs, hit 41 doubles with 11 home runs and 49 RBI, and collected 201 hits (3rd in the league) in 157 games, including 56 multi-hit games. To cap it off he ended the year with a season-high 12-game hitting streak (17-for-46, .370). After hitting eighth in the batting order for most of his career, he became a fixture in the second slot.\n\nWith his 201 hits, Wilson became just the ninth National League shortstop to collect 200 hits in a season; the franchise's first player since Dave Parker (), and the first Pirates shortstop since Hall of Famer Honus Wagner (). Wilson also became the first Pirates player to collect 10 or more doubles, triples and home runs in the same season since Andy Van Slyke ().\n\nDefensively, Wilson led National League shortstops in assists (492), putouts (234), and total chances (743); his 129 double plays led all major league shortstops and broke the club record of 128 — set by Gene Alley in — and went 31 straight contests without making an error. Wilson was named for the 2004 All-Star Game and won the Silver Slugger at shortstop. He was also the Pirates' representative in the Roberto Clemente Award balloting.\n\nIn December 2004, Wilson was hospitalized for an appendectomy. Despite the setback, he was optimistic at spring training . At 6-foot, 175-pound, Wilson had regained six of the 15 pounds he lost. However, he started the season poorly, hitting just .163 in April and .227 for the first half of the season, and acknowledged that he had not been fully recovered when the season started. Late season improvements to his hitting brought his cumulative season numbers to near his career averages, but still well below the standards he had set in 2004. He finished the year with a .257 batting average, a .299 on-base percentage, and a .363 slugging percentage, compared to his career highs of .308, .335, and .459 respectively the year before.\n\nHis defense, however, did not seem to suffer. For the second straight year he led all shortstops in the National League (and, in fact, all of baseball) in assists (523), total chances (783), and double plays (126). Largely because of Wilson and fellow defensive standout second baseman José Castillo, the Pirates turned more double plays in 2005 than any National League team save the Cardinals.\n\nWilson rebounded offensively yet never to the same level as in 2004. Most notably, in 2007, he hit .296 with a career high 12 home runs despite only playing in 135 games. He had frequently been the subject of trade rumors.\n\nOn July 29, 2009, Wilson was traded to the Seattle Mariners along with Ian Snell for Ronny Cedeño and Minor League players Jeff Clement, Aaron Pribanic, Brett Lorin, and Nate Adcock. Wilson was reportedly shocked to find out he had been traded to Seattle saying, \nHe won a Fielding Bible Award for his defensive excellence at shortstop during the season.\n\nOn November 2009, Jack Wilson re-signed with the Seattle Mariners for 2-years, $10 million.\n\nOn August 31, 2011, Wilson was traded to the Atlanta Braves for a player to be named later.\nOn January 13, 2012 the Braves announced they re-signed him to a 1-year 1M plus 500K bonuses for games played.\n\nOn August 31, 2012, the Braves released Wilson.\n\nWilson announced his retirement on September 25, 2012.\n\n"}
{"id": "1825596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825596", "title": "Economy of Manchukuo", "text": "Economy of Manchukuo\n\nThis article looks at the economies of Manchukuo and Mengjiang, in the period 1931-1945. The effective Japanese annexation of 1931 led to a colonial system (see Manchukuo (administration)). Japan invested in heavy industry, and to a lesser extent, agriculture.\n\nThe General Affairs State Council retained Japanese control of official economic policy. The Central Bank of Manchou was the national central bank. The Kwantung Army held the highest authority, representing the Emperor of Japan, and the respective ministries of the nominal Manchoukou central government were also involved. \n\nThe effective annexation gave Japan an area suitable for farming, such as scarcely existed on the country's islands, or other parts, generally mountainous, of the Empire of Japan. The area was primarily agricultural in character, although with some urbanization. Agriculture employed 85% of the population.\n\nFarmers produced many crops, particularly on the southern plains. Manchu farms practiced crop rotation frequently with primitive culture methods. Kaoliang (70%), corn and maize (70%), wheat (80%) and soy (35%) were popular crops.\n\nOthers in quantity were: alfalfa, apples, apricots, chestnuts, col, cotton, cucumber, forage, garlic, giant radish, hemp, indigo, lupulus, millet, nuts, onions, opium poppies (for opium), peaches, pears, peanuts, rice, ricine, rye, sesame, sugar beet, sweet potatoes, thyme, tobacco, and others. In Amur land (Manchu side) honey (1,800 tonnes) was collected.\n\nFrom kaoliang and corn liquors were made, including vodka, sake, beer, soy juices and vinegar. The modern wheat and flour industry was located in Harbin from Russian times apart from basic mills in other areas.\n\nThe most intensive farming occurred in a zone, extending from the Liaotung Gulf to the Northwest. In 1934 it totaled between . The proportions of the principal crops in 1934 were:\n\n\nSoy was Manchukuo's principal crop. The first exports were made in 1908 to England. The economic expansion of soy is attributed in great part to the South Manchurian Railway Company, which enabled direct export from Dairen abroad, in particular to China and Japan proper. Manchukuo hosted many types of processing mill. 1933 to 1934 saw a reduction of more than in cultivated extent and production fell from 4-6 million to 3.84 million tonnes.\n\nThe Japanese developed industry to use soy, with average production of 1,500,000 tonnes. Half was exported to Europe. Crude oil paste for fertilizer and soybeans for food was sent to Japan. The rest of the plant was used in cellulose factories.\n\nManchukuo regularly produced 120,000 kilograms of mediocre quality.\n\nThe opium poppy was grown to obtain opium. In November 1932 the Mitsui Zaibatsu conglomerate held a state monopoly for poppy farming with the \"declared intention\" of reducing its heavy local use. Fixed cultivation areas were set up in Jehol and northwest Kirin. For 1934-35, cultivation area was evaluated as with a yield of 1.1 tonnes/km². There was much illegal growing, and its high profitability retarded the effective suppression of this dangerous drug.\n\n\"Nikisansuke\", a secret Japanese merchant group, participated in the opium industry.\n\nThis group was formed by:\n\n\nThe monopoly generated profits of twenty to thirty million yen per year.\n\nThe military prohibited the use of opium and other narcotics by its troops (punishment was loss of Japanese citizenship) but allowed it to be used as a \"demoralization weapon\" against \"inferior races\", a term that included all non-Japanese peoples.\n\nOne of the participants, Naoki Hoshino negotiated a large loan from Japanese banks using a lien on the profits of Manchukuo's Opium Monopoly Bureau as collateral. Another authority states that annual narcotics revenue in China, including Manchukuo, was estimated by the Japanese military at 300 million yen a year.\n\nSimilar policies operated across Japanese-occupied Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxen, donkeys, heavy horses transported the harvest. Hsingan province worked horses and Bactrian camels, and Heilungkiang and Kirin provinces used sled dogs to aid transport.\n\n\nThe cultivable land was estimated as principally in the central plain.\n\n- Heilungkiang:\n\n- Kirin:\n\n- Liaoning:\n\n- Jehol:\n\n- Chahar:\n\n- Suiyuan:\n\nManchukuo was a productive area, with many domestic animals in subsistence farms or larger properties. Japanese experts increased production with the introduction of foreign species, including pigs, cattle, and sheep, which produced milk, meat, leather and wool.\n\nOther interesting products were the silkworm and the wild silk or tussah (tussor) Worm. The first needed the white mulberry for food; and the second needed Quercus mongolica and other species of oak tree to make Tussah silk. Both products were collected for dyeing and export to Europe and America or sent as raw material to these markets. The cocooned worms were sent to China and Japan. The production of Tussah Silk or pongee was in Kaiping and Antung (Liaoning Province) while silk worms stayed in Kwantung (Kantoshu) and South Manchurian Railway zone, and Chosen.\n\nIn bushels per acre, except cotton in kilograms.\n\nIn Chientao or Yenki Manchu district the Korean Colony extensively cultivated rice.\n\nLumber and wood products were important industries. Jehol and Kirin provinces held great expanses of various types of forest. From 1911 to 1931 Chinese lumberjacks began to work there; the volume of cut wood during the Manchu period was some . Foresting took place mostly in the Yalu and Sungari river areas; their tributaries permitted river transport to woodworking centers in Andong, Kirin and Harbin cities. The Tumen and other northern rivers also provided transport. Typical production before 1939 was per year. Uses were: railroad ties, cellulose paste for paper and for Karafuto rayon production, and export to Japan, Russia and Central and Northern China. A similar pattern may have occurred in Mengjiang.\n\nIn the mountains many species of animals could be hunted for their skins, for meat, or for sport. This area corresponds with the current Heilongjiang province. The situation is similar in Mengjiang too.\n\nThe rivers Amur, Sungari, Nonni, Mutang-Kiang, Ussuri, Liao, Yalu and Tumen, and the lakes Khanka, Buir-Nor and Hulun-Nor are all important fish sources. Species include trout, salmon, and European perch. With the exception of Buir-Nor and Hulun-Nor, these can be fished only in snow-free months. The latter lakes are useful fish sources for residents in Xing'an Province near the Russian-Mongolia frontier area, and were a cause of frontier disputes.\n\nThe annual catch in rivers and lakes was 25,000 tonnes. Sea fishing was in the Po-Hai Gulf and Yellow Sea areas. It included cod, shrimp, sea bream, lobster, and crab.\n\nPrior to Japanese intervention, the sole industry was the Mukden Arsenal, property of Chang Hsueh-liang (son of Chang Tso-Lin), the Manchu Dictator. The colonial government organized and implemented two five-year plans during the 1930s (reminiscent of Soviet Five-Year Plans) with the aid of Naoki Hoshino. Industrial development had as a primary goal supplying raw material and finished products for the Japanese military.\n\nThe first industrial centers in Manchukuo were in the Mukden–Dairen area. Industrial centers were in Anshan, Shakakon, Dairen, Ryojun, Fushun, Fusin, and other cities. Manchukuo used the Chosen ports of Yuki, Seishin and Rashin for the Japan sea area.\n\nProducts included aircraft, automobiles and trucks, blankets, boots, bread and flour, bricks, candies and foods, carpets, raw cellulose, cement, dyes and inks, electrical devices, fabric, farm equipment, glass, industrial paint, industrial paper, liquor and beer, locomotive manufacturing and repair and related railway industries, milk and cheese, mining equipment, munitions, processed leather products, rubber articles, soy and other processed foods, vegetable oil, hand and heavy weapons, etc.\n\nSome measures of Manchu industrial production (1932–35):\n\n\nAfter deposing the Japanese, the Soviet Union sent plant and equipment to the Soviet Far East and Siberia valued at 858,000,000 U.S. dollars. They took only the most modern industrial equipment, laboratories, hospitals, etc., destroying older machines. They took electric power plants, mining equipment, machine tools, and other items.\n\nResidential and commercial construction increased during the Japanese period.\nThe most important cities were:\n\n\nAnother table mentioned this:\n\n\nThe Japanese constructed of roads. They also founded a local airline which linked Dairen, Mukden, Harbin, and other points, with a hub in Hsinking. The Amur, Nonni, Yalu Liao and Sungari rivers served regular cabotage boats and transport vessels in the West and Northwest. Hsingan Province commonly used camels in commerce between it and Meng Chiang and Soviet Outer Mongolia. The principal railway lines were the East Chinese Railway, constructed by Russia and expanded by Japan, and Peking-Mukden railway with Railway Centers in Mukden and Harbin.\n\nThe South Manchurian Railway Company resembled the Canadian Pacific Railway in that it was more than a railroad. In 1931 it invested 27% of capital in coal in Fushum, 3% Anshan iron factory, 8% in Dairen and Ryoujun ports in Kantoshu, with other lesser investments in Yamato Hotel, Tuitsuike Hotel in Tangkatzu spa, merchant and fishing vessels, electricity powerplants, local institutions, schools, research institutes for farming, geology, and mining, sanitation and medical, public services, public architecture, etc. The Japanese government provided most of the funds with the rest provided by private Japanese, Chinese, and Manchu investors.\n\nIn 1935 Manchukuo contained of active railways. 80% were classified as \"State railways\", with owned by the private Manchuria Railway, and the remaining owned by North Manchuria Railway. In 1932 the government planned the construction of of roads in ten years, completing only with the intent of promoting public bus transport.\n\nThe important commercial ports were Ryojun and Dairen. Other ports include Antung, Yingkow, Hulutao. In the Japan Sea area were the ports of Yuki, Rashin and Seishin.\n\nThe most important mining products are coal and iron in Fushum and Fusin. Fushum and Fusin also contain deposits of oil-rich slate and shists. Abundant gold deposits exist in the Greater Khingan Mountains and Amur River. Other minerals include: asbestos, antimony, bauxite, calize, copper, gold, lead, lime, magnesite, manganese, pyrite, marble, salt, soda, silver, sulphur, tar, tin, tungsten, zinc, etc.\nThe principal coal deposit is at Fushun, in Liaoning, extending . Fushum, from Mukden, contains bituminous coal reserves of 700,000,000–1,000,000,000 metric tonnes which became available via open-pit or regular mining methods. Bituminous coal reserves are estimated at 3,000,000,000 metric tonnes, mostly in Liaoning with the rest in Kirin, Heilungkiang, Hsingam, and Jehol provinces. Anthracite coal reserve estimates are 200,000,000 metric tonnes and lignite estimates are 50,500,000 metric tonnes.\n\nAdditional deposits are in Yentai. Private mines operated in Penhsihu and Hsintai. Other important mines are Sian (in Liaoning province), Muleng (in Kirin province) and Peopiao (in Jehol Province).\n\nProduction during 1907–1908 remained under 2,000,000 tonnes. In 1919–1920 extraction increased to 3,700,000 tonnes, rising in 1924–1929 to 5,540,000 tonnes. During 1925 the South Manchurian Railway Company invested in opening coal deposits in Chalai Nor from frontier station Manchouli which extracted 290,000 metric tonnes. By 1934, production had reached 8,000,000 tonnes. Both local use and exports increased.\n\nIn 1934–1936 extractions were:\n\nIn 1923–1924, 1,000,000 tonnes were extracted. Coal production in Manchukuo during 1930 exceeded 10,000,000 tonnes. In 1941, other areas produced 20,000,000 tonnes with reserves of 20,000,000,000 tonnes. Coal production was calculated in accord with other sources. In 1932 reserves of 4,500,000 tonnes. In 1944 estimates increased to 20,000,000,000 tonnes.\n\nThe Japanese built coal gasification plants for industrial uses.\n\nManchukuo also exported processed or raw products to Japan.\n\nAccording to American geologist Forster Payne, 70% of iron sources of East Asia are in coastal regions of Manchuria, with reserves calculated in 1944 of 2,000 to 2,500 Million Tonnes against 721 Million of Tonnes in Germany. Such ores had 60% iron; other reserves near Anshan, south of Mukden, contain a median 40% iron content.\n\n1931–1932 production was 1,000,000 tonnes from deposits in Taku Shan (near Anshan, Liaoning) in the Shan Pai Shang mountains, in Miaoerkow and Tungpientao and in Liaoning. In 1933, the total production of iron in the Anshan and Penhsihu factories was 430,000 tonnes. In 1934, 950,000 tonnes of low-grade hematite was first produced. The Miaoerkow mine also produced 235,000 tonnes of hematite. In the Tungpientao deposits, the reserves are 100,000,000 tonnes of high-grade iron. The Anshan Factories in 1941 produced 1,750,000 iron tonnes and 1,000,000 steel tonnes. In 1942 production increased to 3,600,000 tonnes and Penhsihu produced 500,000 tonnes. In addition, the Tungpientao factory had the capacity to produce 800,000 tonnes.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Special Report of Geological Survey of China\" (1945) mentioned that the Japanese extraction of iron in Manchuria and occupied China grew from 101,000 tonnes to 175,000 tonnes or by 73%.\n\nManchukuo received from Japan scrap iron for iron and steel processing and at the same time exported unfinished steel products.\n\nManchukuo has little petroleum except at Fushum and Fusin where there were extensive deposits of oil-rich slate, oil shale and shist. Fushun produced 1,000,000 tonnes in 1941. In Jehol some oil was extracted in conjunction with coal deposits. Manchukuo also operated oil refineries.\n\nThe principal sources of bauxite in Manchukuo are alunite deposits in Liaoning.\n\nBauxite and Alunite in Yentai, Penshiu, Ninshintai, Saoshin reserves were estimated at 25,300,000 tonnes with metallic content of 55%. Later another 120,000,000 tonnes was discovered. In 1932 the \"Mantetsu\" (South Manchurian Railway Company and Anshan Iron Steel Works) organized laboratories in Fushun and Tokyo to develop processes to exploit these sources. In 1936-38 they founded the \"Manchu Society for Light Metals\". The refining process used electricity from Fushun coal, hydrochloric acid, potassium chloride and iron silica. During 1938-42 aluminum production increased from 5,000 to 30,000 tonnes.\n\nIn 1936, copper production reached 100 tonnes, growing in 1943 to 500 tones. Lead production was 1,223 tonnes. Zinc extraction was 398 tonnes.\n\nMagnesite mines northwest of Tsichiao and Nuishishan opened in 1913, with estimated reserves of 13,600,000,000 tonnes. These sources became exploitable with the extension of the Antung-Mukden railway. In 1941 three installation processed the ore, producing 24% of world output.\n\nHydroelectric power provided the majority of electricity during the period. The Japanese invested in power plants on the Sungari and Yalu rivers. They protected plants in the Nonni and Liao rivers during the August 1945 Soviet Invasion.\n\nOther electricity sources included gas, oil, bunker oil and coal.\n\nIn 1925 grain exports comprised 88% and lumber the remainder. In 1929 there was a slump in soy sales to the United States, and Germany became the principal buyer.\n\nIn 1933 the \"Manchu exterior commerce\" (a Japanese monopoly), recorded that exports exceeded imports. Coal represented 10% and iron a greater amount. Minor exports were other farming products (pigs, mice, kaoliang, peanuts); imports were cotton, flour of various grains, iron, and unfinished and manufactured products for Industry. The principal commerce was with China and Japan, with some exports going to Russia. Other export tables from 1923 indicated output of 4,423,000 tonnes, 50% soy and 30% coal.\n\nIn 1939 foreign trade rose to 2,650,840,000 million Manchukuo Yuan. Japan ranked first, but other trading partners included the United States, China, and Germany.\n\n\nIn 1931, the total production of natural resources inside the Japanese Empire was ¥283,000,000. Foreign purchases, totaled ¥220,000,000, which represented 40% of consumption. However, their local production was evaluated as ¥746,000,000 vs. imports of ¥660,000,000, so local production represented 61% of the total.\n\nJapanese investment led Manchukuo's emergence as the third-largest industrial area in East Asia (after Japan-proper and the U.S.S.R.). At Manchukuo, other foreign businessmen mentioned how \"Japanchukuo\" controlled all Manchukuoan industry with Japanese filling all important technical and administrative roles.\n\nJapanese investment (private and central government) ran at ¥1,715,000,000 (£171,580.000 sterling) in 1938. In 1941, ¥5,000,000,000 was reinvested—the equivalent of $2 for every person in China. For local and foreign commerce, Japan organized a centralized economic structure, a national central bank and a local currency, the yuan of Manchukuo.\n\nDuring the early years of Japanese control, Manchukuo represented 14.3% of total industrial production in China, including 12% of its industrial work force. From 1913 to 1930, farm production grew by 70%; its railways represented 30% of all Chinese railways.\n\nDuring 1937 the Japanese Government with the Japanese Army commissioned industrialist Yoshisuke Aikawa to organize and direct the Manchurian Industrial Development Company with a capital of 758,000,000 yen. This became the \"Manchoukuoan Zaibatsu Empire\" and guided in centralizing mining and heavy industry.\n\nThe Japanese invested ¥440,000,000 (£44,000,000). One-half to two-thirds of the investment was reserved for soy products.\n\nInvestments were made in the Dowa Automobile Company (for the manufacture of cars and trucks), Manshukoku Hikoki Seizo KK (for making engines and aircraft) in Harbin, Morishita Jintan, Mukden Arsenal, Anshan Iron & Steel Works (founded in 1913) and renamed Showa Steel Works (in 1933) in Anshan, Manshukoku Koku KK (Manchurian National Airways), Central Bank of Manchou (national central bank), South Manchurian Railway Company, Yamato Hotel, Tuitsuike Hotel in Tangkantzu lake, Kirin Company and others.\n\nIn 1945 Japan reported its monetary investments in land as 11,000,000,000 Yen.\n\nFrom 1932, the Japanese increased their private and government investments in other industrial sectors:\n\nNippon Lurgi Goshi K.K. of Tokyo, the Japanese Lurgi office in Tokyo, using industrial licenses of Metallgesellschaft-Lurgi Frankfurt am Main A.G. of Germany, installed the following industrial plants in Manchukuo:\n\nThe Japanese company mentioned above decided during the war to install a similar factory in China to process the coal of the Mengchiang and Hopei areas:\n\nIn 1943 the Japanese began the construction of a river channel to ease navigation from Mukden-Anshan-Sinku (Sing-Kow) to the Chili Gulf. A second goal was to regulate the flow of the Liao-ho river on the left side of Fushun en route to Mukden. This project permitted easy access for merchant vessels to the heart of the Manchukuan Industrial District. At the same time the Japanese planned the construction of power plants in Sungari and other rivers for magnesium refining and other developments.\n\nBefore 1932, the economic situation was chaotic, but the establishment of the Yuan of Manchukuo as the local monetary unit in parity with the Japanese Yen, and establishment of the Central Bank of Manchou as the central bank institution produced a relatively stable business climate.\n"}

Hodge was devoted to becoming a member of the Montreal Canadiens. Charlie Hodge began his hockey career with the Montreal Jr. Canadiens in 1950. In 1952, Hodge began showing his true skills finishing with a 2.22 GAA. The next year, he led the Quebec Junior Hockey League with 35 wins and 5 shutouts. Hodge then moved on to the Cincinnati Mohawks in the International Hockey League. There, he led the league in wins and shutouts and helped the Cincinnati Mohawks win the Turner Cup. In 1955, he played his first game with the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nHodge's first NHL game occurred in 1954 with Montreal. Because teams in that era only carried one goalie, and Montreal had perhaps the best goalie of the era in Jacques Plante, Hodge was only used in emergency situations. During this time, he played mostly in the American Hockey League. When Plante was traded in 1963, Hodge got his chance to play full-time. He twice won the Vezina Trophy for being the goaltender of the team allowing the fewest goals during the regular season, once outright in 1963–64 and shared with Gump Worsley in 1965–66. Hodge's name appears on the league championship Stanley Cup six times, although he only actually played in one of those finals. He also played 1 game in the finals in 1955, but lost to Detroit. In 1967, young goaltender Rogatien Vachon was called up by the Canadiens. Vachon played superbly, and there was no more room for Hodge. Hodge was left unprotected in 1967 and he was picked up by the Oakland Seals in the 1967 NHL Expansion Draft.\n\nIn Oakland, Hodge earned 13 wins, including 3 shutouts. Next season, he saw his playing time greatly reduced and was sent down to the Western Hockey League where he played for the Vancouver Canucks. Hodge was an expansion pick again when the Vancouver Canucks entered the NHL in 1970. He posted a winning record while sharing netminding duties with George Gardner and Dunc Wilson. He retired after being unable to come to contract terms with General Manager Bud Poile.\n\nHodge sold real estate for a decade until Winnipeg Jets GM John Ferguson recruited him for the team's scout in Western Canada.\n\nHodge thereafter was an amateur scout for the NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning after two decades with the Pittsburgh Penguins. He received Stanley Cup rings with Pittsburgh in 1991 and 1992. He primarily scouted the Vancouver Giants and Chilliwack Bruins of the Western Hockey League and the Lower Mainland clubs in the British Columbia Hockey League.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1825621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825621", "title": "Rogie Vachon", "text": "Rogie Vachon\n\nRogatien Rosaire \"Rogie\" Vachon (born September 8, 1945) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Montreal Canadiens, Los Angeles Kings, Detroit Red Wings and Boston Bruins in the National Hockey League.\n\nVachon entered the National Hockey League in 1966-67 with the Montreal Canadiens, as a backup goaltender to Gump Worsley. He played only 19 games during the season, but played most of the games in the playoffs and led the Canadiens to the Stanley Cup Finals. They lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs, but Vachon now had a permanent spot on the Canadiens roster. Punch Imlach, the coach of the Leafs, referred to Vachon as a junior B goaltender in an attempt to rattle him during the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nVachon played 39 games in the 1967–68 season and won 23 of them. He and Worsley won the Vezina Trophy, and they had a combined 2.26 GAA, the lowest since 1958-59. Montreal won the Stanley Cup that season and in 1968–69 as well. During the 1969–70 season, Worsley was traded to the Minnesota North Stars and Vachon got the starting job, but the Canadiens missed the playoffs. Early in 1971–72, after losing the starting job to rookie Ken Dryden, Vachon demanded to be traded and he was soon sent to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Denis DeJordy, Dale Hoganson, Noel Price and Doug Robinson.\n\nIt was with the Kings that Vachon had the finest moments of his NHL career. He was runner-up for the Vezina Trophy in 1974–75, and he was named to the NHL Second All-Star Team in 1974-75 and 1976-77. He was named the team MVP four times between 1973 and 1977. In one game in 1976–77, it appeared he was due credit for scoring a goal when the New York Islanders scored on themselves during a delayed penalty; however, after video review, the goal was credited to Vic Venasky after it was determined that Vachon was the second-to-last Kings player to touch the puck before it went in the net. Vachon also set many goaltending records in Kings history that still stand. His number 30 was the first number retired by the Kings, in a ceremony on February 14, 1985. He has since served in a variety of executive positions with the Kings organization.\n\nIn 1976, Vachon was chosen to play for Canada, along with fellow goaltenders Gerry Cheevers and Glenn Resch. He was given the top spot and played in every game of the tournament. He recorded six wins and one loss, two shutouts and a 1.39 goals against average. Canada won the tournament, and Vachon was selected for the All-Star Team and named team MVP.\n\nVachon became a restricted free agent following the 1977–78 season and signed with the Detroit Red Wings. The five-year deal paid Vachon $1.9 million and made him the league's highest paid goaltender. Vachon struggled from the beginning in Detroit. In his first game, he managed just nine saves as the Red Wings peppered the St. Louis net with 42 shots in a game Detroit lost 5-4. As the year wore on, things did not improve for Vachon. Red Wings coach Bobby Kromm told \"Sports Illustrated\": \"When we signed Vachon, we thought we'd improved our club and given ourselves a good 1-2 goaltending punch as there was in hockey. But it hasn't worked out that way.\" Further complicating things was the distraction that Vachon's signing created for the hockey club. Because he was a restricted free agent, the Red Wings were required to give compensation to the Los Angeles Kings, Vachon's former club. An arbitrator ruled that young centre Dale McCourt, whom the Red Wings had selected first overall in the 1977 NHL amateur draft, would go to the Kings. McCourt, who had led the Red Wings in scoring as a rookie in the 1977-78 season, refused to report to Los Angeles and sued the league.\n\nIn his first season with the Wings, Vachon allowed a goal more per game than he had the previous season, and in his second season he continued to struggle, posting numbers below his career averages. To his credit, he gained the distinction of recording the Red Wings' first victory in their new home, the Joe Louis Arena, which was also the first Wings' shutout in the new building.\n\nAfter two disappointing seasons in Detroit, the Red Wings traded Vachon to the Boston Bruins in the summer of 1980 for fellow netminder Gilles Gilbert. In Boston, Vachon served as a mentor to rookie goalies Marco Baron and Jim Craig, who had starred for the US National Team at the 1980 Winter Olympics. Vachon played 53 games for the Bruins and improved his numbers marginally from his time in Detroit; he also won more games than he lost for his first time since leaving Los Angeles. However, in the playoffs, things went poorly as the Bruins were swept in three games by the Minnesota North Stars and surrendered twenty goals in the process. Vachon allowed five goals in the first game, then gave up six in game two before getting pulled. He gave up five more goals in game three and ended the playoffs with a 5.85 goals against average. In the 1981-82 season, Baron took over the starting job from Vachon, who played 38 games as the back-up. Vachon's final NHL appearance came in the 1982 playoffs, when he played one period in relief of starter Mike Moffat in a 7-2 loss to the Quebec Nordiques. He faced just three shots in twenty minutes and allowed a power-play goal to Peter Stastny. Vachon hung up his pads for good six days later.\n\nKnown for his great reflexes and quick glove hand, Vachon was considered one of the premier one-on-one goaltenders of his era. He never allowed a goal on a penalty shot in his entire career. After retiring, Vachon served as general manager of the Kings from 1984 to 1992. He was the Kings' general manager in 1988 when they acquired Wayne Gretzky from the Edmonton Oilers. He also served as interim head coach of the Kings on three separate occasions. On June 27, 2016, Vachon was named an Honored Member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, and was inducted on November 14, 2016.\n\nVachon had seven siblings and grew up on a dairy farm. He was persuaded to play senior level hockey at the age of 14 by a coach who was in need of a goaltender. He married Nicole Blanchard on November 30, 1971, and they had three children; Nicholas (who also played professional hockey), Jade and Marie-Joie, as well as three grandchildren. Nicole died from brain cancer in February 2016, after 44 years of marriage.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1825627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825627", "title": "Blitzkrieg Bop", "text": "Blitzkrieg Bop\n\n\"Blitzkrieg Bop\" is a song by the American punk rock band Ramones. It was released as the band's debut single in February 1976 in the United States. It appeared as the opening track on the band's debut album, \"Ramones\", that was released April 23, 1976.\n\nThe song, whose composition was credited to the band as a whole, was written by drummer Tommy Ramone (music and lyrics) and bassist Dee Dee Ramone (lyrics). Based on a simple three-chord pattern, \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" opens with the chant \"Hey! Ho! Let's go!\" The song is popular at sporting events where \"Hey! Ho! Let's go!\" is sometimes shouted as a rallying cry.\n\n\"Blitzkrieg Bop\" is number 92 on the \"Rolling Stone\" list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In March 2005, \"Q\" magazine placed it at number 31 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks, and in 2008 \"Rolling Stone\" placed it number 18 of the top 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. In 2009 it was named the 25th greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1.\n\n\"Blitzkrieg Bop\" was named after the German World War II tactic \"blitzkrieg\", which means \"lightning war\". The song was mainly written by drummer Tommy Ramone, while bassist Dee Dee Ramone came up with the title (the song was originally called \"Animal Hop\"). Dee Dee also changed one line: the original third verse had the line \"shouting in the back now\", but Dee Dee changed it to \"shoot 'em in the back now\". The precise meaning and subject matter of the song is, unlike many of The Ramones' other early compositions, somewhat vague and obscure. Tommy Ramone told about the chant in \"Ramones: Soundtrack Of Our Lives\", written by Jari-Pekka Laitio-Ramone: \"I came up with the chant walking home from the grocery store carrying a bag of groceries. It was based on the line: 'High Hose nipped her toes' from the song, \"Walking The Dog\" by Rufus Thomas.\"\n\n\"Blitzkrieg Bop\" is a 4/4 time song written in the key of A. It contains four chords; A major (I), B major (II), D major (IV), and E major (V). The song relies heavily on the I, IV, and V chords, most notably used in the intro and verses in the form of the I–IV–V chord progression. The II chord appears only briefly towards the end of the refrain. Johnny Ramone played the entire song with barre chord shapes, as these were signature to his playing style. Dee Dee Ramone simply played the root note of whatever chord the guitarist was playing. Both the rhythm guitar and bass parts, played using downstrokes exclusively, utilize almost constant eighth notes to generate a \"wall of sound\". Joey Ramone's vocal melody relies on five of the seven notes found in the A major scale; A, B, C, D, and E. Tommy Ramone maintains a steady backbeat on the kick and snare throughout the entire song. Constant eighth notes are played on the hi hat cymbals during the verses, and on the floor tom whilst Joey shouts \"Hey, Ho, Let's Go!\", whereas quarter notes are used on the ride cymbal during the refrain. Occasional crashes are used to accentuate certain beats.\n\nThe song was originally played at a very fast tempo (roughly 177 bpm). When the band performed the song live, they started to play it at even faster tempos, gradually increasing the speed throughout their career. At the band's final show, they played the song at an extremely fast tempo well above 200 bpm.\n\n\n\n"}

Once a royal seat of Kuyavia, the town has been the seat of one of two small duchies into which Kuyavia has been temporarily divided. According to a census done on 31 December 2010, the town has a population of 4,603.\n\nThe name Brześć comes from the word Brzost, which is a species of elm that the area was originally covered in, while the name Kujawski is derived from the region of Kuyavia and was assigned to distinguish the town from Brześć Litewski, the capital of the Brest Region.\n\nThe earliest traces of Brześć Kujawski date back to Neolithic settlements, but it wasn't until the thirteenth century that the area became of significant importance as it was the site of a stronghold that was the seat of the Dukes of Kuyavia. In 1250, the town was granted though it has changed several times.\n\nThe earliest written mention of the town dates back to 23 April 1228, when a ceremony took place in Brześć granting the land to the Teutonic Order by Konrad I of Masovia. It was a temporary deal, which included four villages and the Dybów Castle. However, the relationship quickly deteriorated, leaving a significant impact on the people of Brześć as well as the surrounding lands. By 1308, the first dangerous feud broke out in Gdańsk and Pomerania between Władysław I the Elbow-high and the Order.\n\nOn 10 February 1321, the verdict was read in Brześć Papal Order ordering the return of land stolen by Pomerania. However, crusaders rejected the order only for Brześć to rejoin the country during military campaigning a year later. The city came back under Polish rule under peace treaty in Kalisz in 1343. Despite this, Brześć remained under the threat of raids for nearly 100 years, which occurred several times, even after the Battle of Grunwald. The last time the Crusaders laid siege to Brześć was in 1431 without winning it this time.\n\nDuring the fourteenth century, Brześć was the capital of the region, which, after the Union of Lublin, was renamed Brzesko-kujawskie. It existed under this title until the time of partition.\n\nThroughout the period of the wars with the Teutonic Order, Polish kings often visited the city either during the run of the Teutonic Knights, fights, or other systems. The Teutonic-Polish conflict ended in 1435 with the signing of the Peace of Brześć Kujawski. The Thirteen Years' War was fought outside the grounds of Brzesko-kujawskie.\n\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Brześć was the center of the grain trade that declined the Swedish wars. On 23 April 1782, Stanisław August Poniatowski granted a privilege to the town's Jewish population that allowed them to build houses on street specifically for those of the Jewish religion. The city then became under Prussian rule in 1793, followed by rule from the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, and rule by the Polish Kingdom in 1815. During the Nazi occupation in World War II, the town was quickly overrun by the Wehrmacht and renamed Brest-Kujawien (1939-1942). As German forces invaded the USSR, the Brest Ghetto was established as one of the many Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland. When the ghetto was liquidated, the town was reestablished as Brest (Wartheland) (1943-1945) until it was liberated by the Red Army in 1945 and reunited as part of Poland.\n\n"}

It is one of the band's best known songs.

The song was later released as a single in the Netherlands in 1979, then in the U.S. in 1980 by RSO Records from the \"Times Square\" soundtrack album.\n\n\"I Wanna Be Sedated\" was written by Joey Ramone. In an interview about the song, Joey explains the chorus:\n\nThe music video for the song, directed by Bill Fishman, was released in September 1988, about ten years after the song was originally released, to promote the compilation album \"Ramones Mania\". The iconic video features the Ramones sitting at a table (left to right: Johnny, Joey, Marky and Dee Dee), nonchalantly reading and eating corn flakes. Meanwhile, the background room erupts into a meeting place for nuns, acrobats, ballerinas, monsters, cheerleaders, clowns, doctors, fetish nurses, and smoking schoolgirls. The film is intentionally sped up to show the excitement of the background, while the band's actions are in regular motion. This was achieved by having the band members move very slowly, while the crowd moved normally, and then speeding up the film. One of the video's characters is a young Courtney Love.\n\nA still from the video was featured in the liner notes of the band’s 1989 album \"Brain Drain\", though the song itself does not appear on that album.\n\n\"I Wanna Be Sedated\" was number 145 on the \"Rolling Stone\"'s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Marky Ramone is the drummer on this track.\n\nIn 1999, National Public Radio included the song in the \"NPR 100\", in which NPR's music editors sought to compile the one hundred most important American musical works of the 20th century.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1825637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825637", "title": "Rawa Mazowiecka", "text": "Rawa Mazowiecka\n\nRawa Mazowiecka is a town in central Poland, with 17,561 inhabitants (2016). It lies in the Łódź Voivodeship and is the capital of the Rawa County.\n\nFrom 1562 the city hosted the \"Rawa Treasury\" for the Polish army. During an excavation in 1948, a hoard wealth deposit dating from 600 BC was found containing 4 underground rooms with barrels of gold and silver. A smaller treasure was found containing mainly bronze artefacts from the Trzciniec culture, dating from around 1700 BC.\n\nRawa has a long and rich history. First mentioned in 1288, it received city rights in 1321. It used to be one of the most important cities of both the Kingdom of Poland and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and a capital of Rawa Voivodeship, a unit of administrative division which existed from 1462 until 1793. The starosta of Rawa was among most important personalities of early Poland, as he controlled the so-called “Rawa Treasury” - a large sum of tax money, kept at Rawa Castle for financing regular army units.\n\nRawa Mazowiecka was first mentioned as a medieval gord, probably located on one of local hills. In 1321, it received town charter, and in 1355-1370, a brick castle of Mazovian Dukes was built here. During the reign of Siemowit III, Duke of Masovia, Rawa was the capital of the whole Duchy of Mazovia.\n\nIn 1462, Rawa was incorporated into Poland, and named capital of a voivodeship. The town prospered: wars of the 14th and 15th centuries did not affect Rawa. It was one of the largest cities of Mazovia. In 1613, a Jesuit church was built here, and by 1622, Jesuit collegium was completed. Among its students was Jan Chryzostom Pasek, nobleman and writer best remembered for his memoirs.\n\nThe period of prosperity ended during the catastrophic Swedish invasion of Poland (1655 - 1660), when Rawa was captured by Swedes (September 8, 1655), who completely destroyed both town and castle (1657). Rawa never recovered from the destruction, and even though it continued to be the capital of Rawa Voivodeship, the town lost importance. In 1676, its population was only 100. In 1702, Swedish forces returned during the Great Northern War, once again destroying the town. In 1766, most of Rawa burned in a fire, and on February 4, 1793, the town was seized by the Kingdom of Prussia during the military Partitions of Poland. In 1800, Rawa County was created, and in November 1806, during the Napoleonic Wars, Prussians temporarily left the town. It became part of the Duchy of Warsaw.\n\nSince 1815, following Napoleon's defeat, Rawa became part of the Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1822, a town hall was built together with tenement houses in the main town square, and in 1829-1830 a hospital was completed. Rawa quickly modernized, but this process was halted by the Tsarist repression after the failed November Uprising of 1830. On February 4, 1863, Rawa was captured by the rebels of the January Uprising. The town was almost completely destroyed in 1915 during World War I, and once again in World War II, after which 60% of all buildings were left in ruins.\n\nThe Nazis established a Jewish ghetto in Rawa Mazowiecka in March 1941. As Krzysztof Urbański informs in his monograph \"Zagłada Żydów w dystrykcie radomskim\", the ghetto consisted of two parts: one area consisted of a district called Jewish, and the second part was located at Łowicka Street. The two zones spread across the eastern part of town from the bridge on Rawka river to the bridge on Rylka river near the hospital. At the same time the area included the streets of Studzienna, Zatylna, Starościanska, Bóźnicza and Zamkowa Wola.\n\nBy 1942, the number of Jewish prisoners in the Rawa ghetto grew to four thousand. Typhus epidemic broke out due to poor sanitary conditions. The Jews died as the result of starvation diet and occasional executions carried out in the castle. The murderous liquidation of the ghetto began on 27 October 1942. The day before the action, about four thousand Jews from Biała Rawska were brought to Rawa Mazowiecka and spent that night in the open air. In the morning, the Germans surrounded the ghetto. The Jews were forced to leave their homes, grouped together and then deported aboard Holocaust trains to the Treblinka extermination camp. Many town residents were shot during the ghetto liquidation action.\n\nThe picturesque Rawa Castle was built by King Casimir III the Great in order to oversee and protect the southern parts of Mazovia, according to the ancient Chronicle of Jan Długosz. Another chronicler, Jan of Czarnków claimed however that the Castle was founded by Siemowit III, Duke of Masovia. It is not known when the construction began: probably it was in 1355. The castle was not completed until 1370, and by then, it served as administrative center of the Duchy of Rawa, which was independent in 1455-62. On December 7, 1462, King Casimir IV visited the castle, announcing the incorporation of the Duchy of Rawa, and creation of Rawa Voivodeship.\n\nIn 1507, the complex burned in a fire, and two years ago, its reconstruction began. After ten years, the walls and the tower were strengthened. Since Rawa Castle was regarded as a modern fortress, in 1559 the so-called Rawa Treasure was placed here: the tax money needed to finance regular army. Development of military technology made the complex obsolete by the mid-17th century. In September 1655, it was captured by Swedes during the Deluge. In 1657, before their retreat, Swedish soldiers blew up most of the complex; only the tower and fragments of walls remained. Soon afterwards, high ranking Swedish officer Pontus De La Gardie was temporarily imprisoned in the remains of the castle.\n\nAfter the destruction of 1657, the complex was not rebuilt, and by the early 18th century, it was a ruin. In 1789, the Sejm assigned money for its reconstruction, and assigned the task to Starosta of Rawa, Feliks Lanckoroński. His efforts most likely failed, as by 1794 the castle was abandoned. Prussian authorities ordered its demolition, in order to gain building materials. As a result, only the tower remained, with fragments of walls.\n\nIn 1601 Carl Gyllenhielm, the so-called royal bastard, was brought to Rawa.

He was also one of the most penalized goalies, and was regularly involved in fights. In 1972, he was selected sixth overall by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1972 NHL Amateur Draft. In 1973 he played with the Nova Scotia Voyageurs of the American Hockey League (AHL), his first taste of professional hockey. For his outstanding play, Larocque was awarded the Hap Holmes Memorial Award with teammate Michel Deguise, and was selected to the Second All-Star Team.\n\nLarocque started his National Hockey League (NHL) career in 1974 with the Canadiens. That was the season that Ken Dryden, one of the top goalies in that era, sat out to complete his law degree. Larocque shared playing time during the season with Michel Plasse and Wayne Thomas, but was the starting goalie in the playoffs. Dryden returned in 1975, and Larocque settled down as his back-up, sharing four Vezina Trophy wins, in an era when the award was given to the principal goalies on the team allowing the fewest goals in the regular season. The first three were largely because of Dryden's all-star play. In 1977, Larocque led the NHL with a 2.09 goals against average, but with Dryden ahead of him in the Canadiens net, he only managed to play 26 games. The Canadiens won four Stanley Cups during that stretch, but Larocque's only action in the playoff was for one period in the 1979 playoffs; Dryden was in front of the nets the rest of the time. The Stanley Cup wins were in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979.\n\nIn 1979, Dryden retired. Larocque saw more action as a result, and won his fourth and final Vezina Trophy, sharing duties with Richard Sevigny and newly-acquired Denis Herron in 1981. Near the trade deadline during that season, he was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs for defenceman Robert Picard. Larocque played 50 games the following season with a struggling Leafs team. Larocque was in net when the Buffalo Sabres scored a NHL record of 9 goals in one period in a 14-4 game. He was again traded, this time to the Philadelphia Flyers in 1983, in return for goaltender Rick St. Croix, and finished his NHL career with the St. Louis Blues in 1984 after being sold by the Flyers, who had settled on Pelle Lindbergh in goal. Larocque retired from hockey in 1985 after playing 13 games with the Peoria Rivermen in the International Hockey League (IHL).\n\nAfter his playing career ended, he served as general manager of the Victoriaville Tigres of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) during the 1989–90 season and won QMJHL executive of the year for 1989–90. He was vice president of the QMJHL during the 1991–92 season and still held the position at time of his death.\n\nHe died of brain cancer at age 40 in his hometown of Hull, Quebec.\n\n\n"}

The imprint was edited by Mark Nevelow, who instead of developing comics with the established names in the alternative comics field, chose to introduce several unknown illustrators with an eclectic and diverse line of experimental graphic novels and stories. Unusual for the time, Nevelow succeeded in getting DC to agree to contracts giving creator ownership to writers and artists.\n\nDC announced its plan to form the Piranha imprint in 1987. Nevelow's associate editor on the imprint was Karen McBurnie. Designer Dean Motter created the signature Piranha cover format and logo. After the initial 1989 titles were art directed by John Workman, the in-house Piranha production design was by Bhob Stewart from 1989 to 1992, with other design contributions by Dale Crain, Rick Spanier, Richard Bruning, Veronica Carlin, Margaret Clark and Rick Keene.\n\nArtist-writer Alec Stevens was the first creator to sign a contract with Piranha Press in September, 1988, and his graphic novels \"The Sinners\" and \"Hardcore\" followed in June 1989 and January 1990, respectively. A third book, \"A Winter Within\", was verbally agreed upon, but a contract never materialized.\n\nPiranha's most successful title was Kyle Baker's \"Why I Hate Saturn\" which had multiple printings. \"Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children\", a 32-page monthly anthology of Dave Louapre's stories, illustrated by Dan Sweetman, had a 30-issue run from June 1989 to September 1992. Humor series of note were John Blair Moore's \"Invaders from Home!!!\", Marc Hempel's 120-page \"Gregory\", and \"Epicurus the Sage\" by William Messner-Loebs and Sam Kieth.\n\nOther Piranha writers and artists included Gil Ashby, Mark Badger, Glenn Barr, Charlie Boatner, Damon Cardwell, Tim Conrad, Michael Davis, Gerard Jones, Jon Hammer, Alison Marek, Douglas Michael, Steve Parkhouse, and Jennifer Waters.\n\nIn early 1991, Nevelow left the company.\nWith his departure, the imprint began to drastically change its editorial direction in an effort to attain the commercial success that largely eluded them.\n\nPiranha's last published comic was the one-shot \"Prince and the New Power Generation: Three Chains of Gold\", which came out in 1994. The imprint was shut down shortly thereafter, replaced by the new imprint Paradox Press. Howard Cruse's \"Stuck Rubber Baby\" (1995) was a project that began with Piranha Press. The book took so long for Cruse to draw, however, that it was later published under the Paradox Press imprint by editors Andy Helfer and Bronwyn Taggart, with design by Robbin Brosterman.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1988, he became a resident scholar at Stanford University's Hoover Institution—first as a national fellow, then a visiting scholar, and most recently a research fellow there and at The Independent Institute. He went on leave from Hoover to serve as Assistant Secretary for the Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development in the United States Department of Education during 2007-2009. At the beginning of September 2016, he was selected to lead the \"agency action team\" for the Department of Education in the Trump-Pence transition.\n\nDuring the 1970s and '80s, Evers was involved in the libertarian movement in the United States and the Libertarian Party specifically. In 1980, he was the Libertarian Party candidate for Congress in the 12th Congressional District of California. For several years he edited the libertarian magazine \"Inquiry\". \"Evers was the first editor of \"Inquiry\" which was initially published by the Cato Institute. He was abruptly fired in a nasty internal power dispute with Cato president Ed Crane.\" At the time, he was considered a radical (he was a prominent member of the party's Radical Caucus) and an ally of Murray Rothbard against Crane and his supporters. In 1984, Evers was campaign director for Libertarian Party presidential candidate David Bergland. In 1993, he helped defeat an effort to eliminate the LP membership Pledge and moderate the LP Platform. He was still a member of the Libertarian National Committee as of March 1996.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Evers began to work in the Republican Party, serving on George W. Bush's transition team after the 2000 election and acting as a Bush adviser in the 2000 and 2004 campaigns and as a McCain adviser in 2008 and a Romney adviser in the 2012 presidential elections. In California, Evers has also served on the Republican State Central Committee and acted as an adviser to several Republican gubernatorial campaigns.\n\nIn 1995, while one of his children was a third-grader at Escondido Elementary School in the Palo Alto Unified School District in California, Evers became an outspoken participant in the Math Wars over the teaching of mathematics. He became a leading member of the steering committee of a group called HOLD (Honest Open Logical Debate) on Math Reform and organized a publicity stunt in which a toilet was mounted on the back of a pick-up truck and driven to a protest outside the school district headquarters. There Evers ceremonially flushed the new curriculum.\n\nEvers was a commissioner on the California State Academic Standards Commission from 1996 to 1998 and again in 2010. At the Hoover Institution, he joined its Koret Task Force on K-12 Education, which was formed in 1999 and wound up its operations in 2014.\n\nIn 2001, he was appointed by President George W. Bush to the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars and was appointed by Education Secretary Rod Paige to the National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board. From July to December 2003, he served as a senior education adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority during the U.S. occupation of Iraq. In 2004 he was elected to the Santa Clara County Board of Education in California , on which he served until 2007.\n\nOn February 8, 2007, Bush nominated Evers to be an assistant secretary of education. His confirmation by the Senate was announced on October 17, 2007. The eight-month delay was largely attributed to enemies he made during the Math Wars.\n\nEvers has written several opinion columns for well-known publications such as \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The Los Angeles Times\", and \"The Christian Science Monitor\".\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 7, 1999. In the episode, inspired by a \"Zorro\" movie, Homer begins slapping people with a glove and challenging them to duels. However, when a real Southern gentleman accepts Homer's request for a duel, the Simpsons run off to the old farm Homer lived in with his parents and breed a dangerously addictive but successful tobacco/tomato hybrid called \"tomacco\". The episode was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Bob Anderson. \n\nThe episode received mixed reviews.\n\nThe Simpsons go to the Springfield Googelplex Movie Theaters to see \"The Poke of Zorro\". Afterwards, Homer, imitating Zorro, frightens Snake away by challenging him to a duel by slapping him with a glove when he insults Marge; he then uses his dueling glove to get anything he wants from people. When a gun-toting Southern colonel at the Kwik-E-Mart actually accepts Homer's \"challenge\", Homer finds himself bound to a duel at dawn the following day.\n\nThe next morning, the colonel and his wife wait outside the house in their RV. The Simpsons sneak out, with Homer clinging to an old Christmas tree, and search for a temporary home. They find Grampa's old farmhouse on Rural Route 9 outside of Springfield, where, despite the land's poor reputation for growing crops, Homer becomes a farmer following a visit to the general store. After failing to grow a thing for a month, Homer calls Lenny and requests he sends plutonium. The crops eventually grow, but since Homer had accidentally mixed the tomato seeds with the tobacco seeds, a new product is created. Homer calls the mutated crop \"Tomacco\", which tastes terrible, but is highly addictive. Homer and Marge set up a stall, selling Homer's tomacco and Marge's fresh-baked mincemeat pie. While the pies do not sell well, the tomacco is such a success that executives from Laramie Cigarettes offer to buy the rights to tomacco for $150 million.\n\nLisa protests that the Simpsons cannot accept the tobacco executives' money, but Homer misinterprets this statement and rejects the offer as insulting, demanding $150 \"billion\" for tomacco, which they refuse. Dumped back at the farmhouse, the family sees tomacco-addicted animals from other farms eating their crops. With only one plant left, the family runs into the house, where Lisa urges Homer to destroy it, but Homer refuses until the livestock breaks in. He tosses the plant into the air and it lands in the hands of a Laramie executive. The executives' helicopter leaves, but a tomacco-addicted sheep has snuck on board and attacks them. The helicopter crashes, killing everyone on board except for the sheep and destroying the final tomacco plant. The Simpsons return home to find that the Southern gentleman and his wife are still waiting for Homer to go through with the duel. Homer does and is shot in the arm, but declines to go to the hospital until after eating one of Marge's mincemeat pies.\n\nThe episode was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Bob Anderson as part of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\" (1999–2000). The American rock band The B-52's guest starred in the episode as themselves singing the song \"Glove Slap\", a parody of their song Love Shack. The process of making a 'tomacco' product had first been documented in a 1959 \"Scientific American\" article, which stated that nicotine could be found in the tomato plant after grafting. Due to the academic and industrial importance of this breakthrough process, this article was reprinted in a 1968 \"Scientific American\" compilation.\n\nThe Simpsons go to a screening of \"The Poke of Zorro\", a loose parody of the Zorro film \"The Mask of Zorro\" (1998). The movie also parodies various films. Jonathan Gray wrote in \"Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality\" that \"\"The Poke of Zorro\" ridicules the outlandishness of Hollywood blockbuster fare, especially its blatant historical inaccuracies which sees the film feature Zorro, King Arthur, the Three Musketeers, the Scarlet Pimpernel, the Man in the Iron Mask and ninjas in nineteenth century Mexico.\" \n\nDuring the credit list of \"The Poke of Zorro\", actors John Byner, Shawn Wayans, Rita Rudner, Cheech Marin, Gina Gershon, Curtis Armstrong, Eric Roberts, Spalding Gray, Anthony Hopkins, James Earl Jones, Meryl Streep, singer Victoria Beckham, wrestler Steve Austin, soccer player Pelé, and producer Robert Evans as having roles in the film. The movie also thanks \"Penthouse\" publisher Bob Guccione and the Philadelphia Flyers NHL team.\n\nDuring \"The Poke of Zoro\", there are advertisements which reference products and movies. The Buzz Cola advertisement shown before \"The Poke of Zorro\" is a parody of the opening Normandy invasion sequence from the film \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998). Gray writes that it \"scorns the proclivity of ads to use any gimmick to grab attention, regardless of the ethics: as an indignant Lisa asks incredulously, 'Do they really think cheapening the memory of our veterans will sell soda?'\" Amongst the other films advertised at the theater is \"My Dinner with Jar Jar\", a reference to the character Jar Jar Binks from \"Star Wars\" and the 1981 film \"My Dinner with Andre\".\n\nThe episode features multiple references to songs and themes. The song \"Glove Slap\" is a parody of the song \"Love Shack\". The B-52's sang both the original and the amended version used in the episode. The music playing during the sequence where the Simpsons begin farming is the theme tune from the television series \"Green Acres\". A farmer is shown using an elephant to measure his corn plants' height; this is a reference to the song \"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" in the musical \"Oklahoma!\", which features the line \"the corn is as high an elephant's eye\". The Southern colonel's horn plays the opening few notes of the song \"Dixie\".\n\nThe episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 7, 1999. On October 7, 2008, the episode was released on DVD as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season\". Staff members Mike Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, George Meyer, and Matt Selman participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. \n\nWhile reviewing the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\", DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that \"E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)\" provides \"the kind of episode typical of the series' 'post-classic' years. While it doesn't become a dud, it lacks the spark and zing typical of the best \"Simpsons\". We get a mix of decent moments but nothing that elevates the episode above the level of mediocrity.\" In the July 26, 2007 issue of \"Nature\", the scientific journal's editorial staff listed the episode among \"The Top Ten science moments in \"The Simpsons.\"\" The journal praises Homer's attempts to be a farmer, which involve using plutonium as a fertilizer and crossbreeding DNA from tobacco seeds and tomato seeds to create an addicting fruit. In 2011, Keith Plocek of \"LA Weekly\"s Squid Ink blog named \"E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)\" the tenth best episode of the show with a food theme. The \"Phoenix New Times\" listed the episode as one of the top ten Simpsons episodes of all time.\n\nA \"Simpsons\" fan, Rob Baur of Lake Oswego, Oregon, was inspired by the episode. Remembering the article in a textbook, Baur cultivated real tomacco in 2003. The plant produced offspring that looked like a normal tomato, but Baur suspected that it contained a lethal amount of nicotine and thus would be inedible. Testing later proved that the leaves of the plant contained some nicotine. Both plants are members of the same family, \"Solanaceae\" or nightshade. The tomacco plant bore tomaccoes until it died after 18 months, spending one winter indoors. Baur appeared on the episode's DVD commentary, discussing the plant and resulting fame.\n\nThe 2004 convention of the American Dialect Society named \"tomacco\" as the new word \"least likely to succeed.\" Tomacco was a wordspy.com \"Word of the Day\".\n\n"}

The line was an update of the predecessor W111 and W112 \"fintail\" sedans. The cars were successful in West Germany and in export markets including North America and Southeast Asia. During the seven-year run, a total of 383,361 units were manufactured.\n\nSince the W108 and W109 were only available as 4-door models, similarly squarish 2-door W111 and W112 coupés and cabriolets filled those niches and are frequently mistaken for them.\n\nThe car's predecessors, the Mercedes-Benz W111 (1959–71) and W112 (1961–67), helped Mercedes-Benz develop greater sales and achieve economy of scale production, reducing both manufacture time and cost. Throughout the 1950s, Mercedes-Benz had been producing the coachwork 300 S and 300 SL and all but hand-built 300 Adenauers alongside conveyor assembled Pontons (190, 190 SL and 220) etc. Unifying the entire Mercedes-Benz range into the fintail () reduced production onto a single automobile platform.\n\nHowever, fashion trends in the early 1960s changed rapidly. By the time the Paul Bracq-designed 2-door coupé and cabriolet W111s were launched, the predecessor W111 sedan's fins lost their chrome trim and sharp appearance. The arrival of the W113 'Pagoda' coupé and cabriolet in 1963 saw them further buried into the trunk's contour. Finally, they disappeared completely on the W100 600 in 1963.\n\nThe evolution of the W111 began under the leadership of Bracq in 1961 and ended in 1963. Although the fins' departure was the most visible change, the W108 had a lower body waist line and increased glass area - the windscreen alone was 17% larger than W111's - prominent enough to be referred to as a \"greenhouse\". The cars had a 60 mm lower ride and 15 mm wider doors. The result was a visibly newer-looking, sleeker car with an open and spacious interior.\n\nDue to the success of long wheelbase 300 SE Lang (W112), which was intended as an interim car between 300 \"Adenauer\" (W189) and \"Grosser Mercedes\" 600 (W100), Mercedes-Benz continued to offer two wheelbase lengths for W108/W109. Initially, the wheelbase lengths denoted W108 (standard) and W109 (long). For 1968 model year, this distinction changed with the introduction of 280 SEL that retained W108, rather than W109, chassis designation.\n\nThe larger 3-litre six-cylinder inline engine (300 SEL) were exclusive to W109 with odd exception of standard wheelbase 300 SEb (1965–1967), which was designated as W108. The smaller six-cylinder inline engines (250 S/SE and 280 S/SE/SEL) were assigned to W108 only. Both eventually received the V8 engines in 1967 (W109) and 1970 (W108).\n\nW109 was more luxuriously appointed than W108, featuring burled walnut dashboards, automatic transmission, and power windows along with optional air conditioning system.\n\nThe W108 and W109 had different types of suspension systems: W108 retained the steel coil springs and oil-filled shock absorbers while W109 used the self-levelling air suspension.\n\nThe W108/W109 premiered at the Frankfurt Auto Show in 1965. The initial model range consisted of three W108s (250 S, 250 SE, and 300 SEb) and a sole W109 (300 SEL). The six-inline engines were carried over from the previous generation with mechanical refinements. The 2.2-litre M180 engine was enlarged to 2.5 litres while the fuel-injected 3-litre M189 version was carried over from \"300 Adenauer\".\n\nThe 250 S was fitted with 2,496 cc M108 engine with dual two-barrel downdraft carburettors producing at 5,400 rpm. It could accelerate to in 13 seconds for manual and 14 for automatic. The top speed was for manual and for automatic. The 250 SE had the same engine as 250 S except for fuel injection system and different engine designation (M129). With increased engine output of at 5,500 rpm, 250 SE was one second faster to 100 km/h than 250 S and had higher top speed of for both manual and automatic versions.\n\nBoth 300 SEb and 300 SEL were fitted with 2,966 cc M189 engine. The engine was an updated version of M186, originally developed in 1951 for Type 300 \"Adenauer\", with Bosch mechanical fuel-injection system that caliberated the optimal fuel mixture automatically based on throttle pedal position and movement, engine speed, atmospheric pressure, water temperature, and driving conditions. The engine's output was at 5,400 rpm, and 300 SEb and 300 SEL could accelerate to in 12 seconds and reach the top speed of ( with automatic transmission).\n\nThe production figures for the first series from 1965 to 1967 showed 129,858 of 250 S/250 SE and 5,106 of 300 SEb/300 SEL. The tiny production figure of 300 SEb/300 SEL reflected the higher sales price with luxurious appointments, exclusivity, and smaller global market share.\n\nIn 1966 company engineer Erich Waxenberger transplanted a massive 6.3 L Mercedes-Benz M100 V8 from the company's flagship 600 (W100) into a W109 chassis, creating the first Q-car from Mercedes-Benz. Full-scale production of 300 SEL 6.3 began in December 1967. 300 SEL 6.3 could reach in 6.5 seconds and the top speed of , making it the quickest production sedan, a title it held for many years.\n\nTo coincide with the launch of new smaller executive model, \"/8\" (Stroke Eight), to be slotted below W108/W109, the inline six engine range was revised in 1967. The 2.5-litre engine was enlarged to 2,778 cc (2.8 litres) and renamed as M130 for both carburetted () and fuel injected versions.\n\n250 S and 250 SE were renamed as 280 S and 280 SE in November 1967 while 250 S was still offered in some export markets until March 1969. In January 1968, a long wheelbase variation, 280 SEL, was introduced for the first time. The 280 S could reach in 12.5 seconds and top speed of ( with automatic transmission).

The acceleration to was 10.5 seconds, and the top speed was .\n\nFollowing the strong reception of limited production V8-powered 300 SEL 6.3 in 1967, Mercedes-Benz offered the all-new 3.5-litre M116 V8 engine with new Bosch D-Jetronic electronic fuel injection in 1969. The V8 engine would move W108/W109 further upmarket in many export markets and allow them to be more competitive in the United States where many passenger vehicles, especially the American luxury marques, were fitted with V8 engines. The new V8 engine was first fitted to W109 in August 1969 as 300 SEL 3.5 then to W108 in July 1970 as 280 SE 3.5 and 280 SEL 3.5.\n\nThe 3.5-litre V8 engine was bored out to 4,520 cc (4.5 litres) as to compensate for the loss of power following the changes in emission control regulations and due to lower fuel octane rating in the United States. The larger V8 engine was designated as M117 and had the same output figures as 3.5-litre V8 engine. It was initially exclusive for the United States from 1971 to 1973 until the introduction of 450 SE/450 SEL (W116) which went on sale worldwide in September 1972 along with 450 SL (R107) and 450 SLC (C107). 280 SE 4.5/280 SEL 4.5 and 300 SEL 4.5 were introduced in the spring of 1971.\n\nThe 300 SEL 2.8 was dropped in January 1970 since 300 SEL 3.5 was selling better and had better performance. The production of 280 SEL ended in April 1971, leaving 280 S and 280 SE as sole models with six-cylinder inline engines until the end of W108/W109 production in 1972, following the introduction of W116.\n\nThe standard transmission for Europe was a four-speed manual gearbox. A four-speed automatic option was also available. Unusual among mainstream European automakers of the time, Mercedes developed and built their own automatic transmission system. A five-speed manual gearbox was offered for six-cylinder inline engines only from 1969 to 1972, though a few customers opted for it.\n\nWhen the 3.5-litre V8 engine was introduced in 1969, the sole transmission choice was a four-speed automatic with fluid coupling. The customers could request the four-speed manual transmission with price reduction if they inclined so. As for 4.5-litre V8 engine for the United States, the transmission was three-speed automatic with torque converter.\n\n"}

He then moved to France to be coach of Chamonix HC (1989–90), Diables Rouges de Briançon (1990–91) and Angers (1994–95), and then returned to the Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey. He is noted for being the last Montreal Canadien to wear #33 prior to Patrick Roy.\n\nBefore making the NHL, Sevigny played for 5 different teams. He spent his junior career in the QMJHL with the Granby Vicks and the Sherbrooke Castors. In 1976, Sevigny was selected to the QMJHL West First All-Star Team by playing in 55 games and posting a 3.85 GAA. His strong play made Team Canada notice him and he was selected to play in the 1976 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships where he won a silver medal. Sevigny's play at the international level caught the attention of the Montreal Canadiens and in 1977, he was selected 124th overall in the 1977 NHL amateur draft. The Canadiens also picked seven other goalies creating some competition to join the roster.\n\nIn 1978, Sevigny played for the Kalamazoo Wings in the IHL. He played in 35 games and recorded a 3.01 GAA, good enough to be selected to the Second All-Star Team. He then spent the next season in the AHL, with the Springfield Indians, and the Nova Scotia Voyageurs.\n\nIn the 1979 Stanley Cup Finals, Michel Larocque was scheduled to start game two. Larocque was injured during the pre-game warm up and Sevigny was dressed as a backup in his place. The Canadiens would win that year and Sevigny's name was engraved on the Stanley Cup before ever playing an NHL game.\n\nWith Ken Dryden, retiring in the off-season in 1979, spots opened up on the Canadiens roster. Sevigny attended training camp and played well enough to start in eleven regular season games in the 1979-80 season. The following season, he played in 33 games, won 20 of them and had a league best 2.40 GAA. He won the Vezina Trophy along with Denis Herron and Michel Larocque with Montreal that season. On April 20, 1984, Sevigny took part in the \"Vendredi Saint\" brawl against the Quebec Nordiques. The two benches cleared twice during the game and delayed the game for more than an hour. Sevigny fought the Nordiques' backup goalie Clint Malarchuk and was given a game misconduct.\n\nThe next two seasons saw Sevigny post back to back winning records but he was not offered a contract by the Canadiens. They released him and he was quickly picked up by the Quebec Nordiques. He signed a four-year deal and spent the next three seasons with the Nordiques and their AHL affiliate, the Fredericton Express before finishing his career in France in 1990.\n\nAccording to hockey lore, Sevigny was quoted as saying that Guy Lafleur would have Wayne Gretzky in his back pocket during the 1981 playoffs, a quote that motivated the Oilers team to victory over the fabled Habs.\nSevigny has involved himself in old-timers charity hockey games and has coached the semi-pro Verdun Dragons.\n\n"}

He was the International Commission of Jurists' \"chef de mission\" to Egypt on sequestration of the Egyptian Bar in 1998. He was the convener of the Human Rights Committee of the Faculty of Advocates.\n\nIn 2005, Davidson was appointed by the UK government to head a review examining the implementation of European Union legislation in the UK. The report – known as the 'Davidson Review' – was issued in 2006 and recommended a series of measures to simplify implementation, including a ban on 'gold-plating'.\n\nIn August 2014, Davidson attended the Fourth Forum on Development of Tibet in Lhasa, Tibet as a guest of the Chinese government. Chinese state media reported comments by him praising China's work in Tibet and criticising Western media. The conference organisers published a \"Lhasa Consensus\" document supporting the position and policy of the Chinese government regarding Tibet. According to the document, it was endorsed by all participants in the forum.\n\nShortly after, a number of Western participants disassociated themselves from the 'Consensus', stating that they were unaware it would be represented as having their support. Lord Davidson did not respond to Western media enquiries regarding the accuracy of the comments attributed to him and seeking clarification of his position regarding the Lhasa Consensus. His participation, reported comments and subsequent refusal to make further comment were strongly criticised by Free Tibet, who noted that during his visit to Tibet, security forces fired on a demonstration in another region of Tibet, fatally injuring four protesters.\n\n"}

Adorno. The text was circulated among friends and colleagues in 1944 under the title of Philosophical Fragments (German: \"Philosophische Fragmente\"). A revised version was published under the title of \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" in 1947.\n\nOne of the core texts of critical theory, \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" explores the socio-psychological \"status quo\" that had been responsible for what the Frankfurt School considered the failure of the Age of Enlightenment. Together with \"The Authoritarian Personality\" (1950; also co-authored by Adorno) and Frankfurt School member Herbert Marcuse's \"One-Dimensional Man\" (1964), it has had a major effect on 20th-century philosophy, sociology, culture, and politics, inspiring especially the New Left of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nOne of the distinguishing characteristics of the new critical theory, as Adorno and Horkheimer set out to elaborate it in \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\", is a certain ambivalence concerning the ultimate source or foundation of social domination. This ambivalence gave rise to the \"pessimism\" of the new critical theory over the possibility of human emancipation and freedom.\n\nThis ambivalence was rooted in the historical circumstances in which \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" was originally produced: the authors saw National Socialism, Stalinism, state capitalism, and culture industry as entirely new forms of social domination that could not be adequately explained within the terms of traditional critical theory.\n\nFor Adorno and Horkheimer (relying on the economist Friedrich Pollock's thesis on National Socialism), state intervention in the economy had effectively abolished the tension in capitalism between the \"relations of production\" and the \"material productive forces of society,\" a tension which, according to traditional critical theory, constituted the primary contradiction within capitalism. The market (as an \"unconscious\" mechanism for the distribution of goods) had been replaced by centralized planning.\n\nYet, contrary to Marx's famous prediction in the \"Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy\", this shift did not lead to \"an era of social revolution,\" but rather to fascism and totalitarianism. As such, traditional critical theory was left, in Jürgen Habermas's words, without \"anything in reserve to which it might appeal; and when the forces of production enter into a baneful symbiosis with the relations of production that they were supposed to blow wide open, there is no longer any dynamism upon which critique could base its hope.\" For Adorno and Horkheimer, this posed the problem of how to account for the apparent persistence of domination in the absence of the very contradiction that, according to traditional critical theory, was the source of domination itself.\n\nThe problems posed by the rise of fascism with the demise of the liberal state and the market (together with the failure of a social revolution to materialize in its wake) constitute the theoretical and historical perspective that frames the overall argument of the book—the two theses that \"Myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment reverts to mythology.\" The history of human societies, as well as that of the formation of individual ego or self, is re-evaluated from the standpoint of what Horkheimer and Adorno perceived at the time as the ultimate outcome of this history: the collapse or \"regression\" of reason, with the rise of National Socialism, into something (referred to as merely \"enlightenment\" for the majority of the text) resembling the very forms of superstition and myth out of which reason had supposedly emerged as a result of historical progress or development.\n\nHorkheimer and Adorno believe that in the process of \"enlightenment,\" modern philosophy had become over-rationalized and an instrument of technocracy. They characterized the peak of this process as positivism, referring to both the logical positivism of the Vienna Circle and broader trends that they saw in continuity with this movement. Horkheimer and Adorno's critique of positivism has been criticized as too broad; they are particularly critiqued for interpreting Ludwig Wittgenstein as a positivist—at the time only his \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" had been published, not his later works—and for failing to examine critiques of positivism from within analytic philosophy.\n\nTo characterize this history, Horkheimer and Adorno draw on a wide variety of material, including the philosophical anthropology contained in Marx's early writings, centered on the notion of \"labor\"; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality (and the emergence of conscience through the renunciation of the will to power); Freud's account in \"Totem and Taboo\" of the emergence of civilization and law in murder of the primordial father; ethnological research on magic and rituals in primitive societies; as well as myth criticism, philology, and literary analysis.\n\nThe authors coined the term \"culture industry\", arguing that in a capitalist society mass culture is akin to a factory producing standardized cultural goods—films, radio programmes, magazines, etc. These homogenized cultural products are used to manipulate mass society into docility and passivity. The introduction of the radio, a mass medium, no longer permits its listener any mechanism of reply, as was the case with the telephone. Instead, listeners are not subjects anymore but passive receptacles exposed \"in authoritarian fashion to the same programs put out by different stations.\"\n\nBy associating the Enlightenment and the Holocaust with Marquis de Sade's works—especially Juliette, in \"Excursus II\"—the text also contributed to the pathologisation of sadomasochist desires, as discussed by the sexuality historian Alison Moore.\n\nThe book made its first appearance in 1944 under the title \"Philosophische Fragmente\" by Social Studies Association, Inc., New York. A revised version was published in 1947 by Querio Verlag in Amsterdam with the title \"Dialektik der Aufklärung.\" It was reissued in 1969 by S Fischer Verlag GmbH. There have been two English translations: the first by John Cumming (New York: Herder and Herder, 1972) and a more recent translation, based on the definitive text from Horkheimer's collected works, by Edmund Jephcott (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2002).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1825702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825702", "title": "Automatic identification system", "text": "Automatic identification system\n\nThe automatic identification system (AIS) is an automatic tracking system that uses transponders on ships and is used by vessel traffic services (VTS). When satellites are used to detect AIS signatures, the term \"Satellite-AIS\" (S-AIS) is used. AIS information supplements marine radar, which continues to be the primary method of collision avoidance for water transport. Although technically and operationally distinct, the ADS-B system is analogous to AIS and performs a similar function for aircraft.\n\nInformation provided by AIS equipment, such as unique identification, position, course, and speed, can be displayed on a screen or an electronic chart display and information system (ECDIS). AIS is intended to assist a vessel's watchstanding officers and allow maritime authorities to track and monitor vessel movements. AIS integrates a standardized VHF transceiver with a positioning system such as a Global Positioning System receiver, with other electronic navigation sensors, such as a gyrocompass or rate of turn indicator. Vessels fitted with AIS transceivers can be tracked by AIS base stations located along coast lines or, when out of range of terrestrial networks, through a growing number of satellites that are fitted with special AIS receivers which are capable of deconflicting a large number of signatures.\n\nThe International Maritime Organization's International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea requires AIS to be fitted aboard international voyaging ships with , and all passenger ships regardless of size. For a variety of reasons, ships can turn off their AIS transponders.\n\nAIS is intended, primarily, to allow ships to view marine traffic in their area and to be seen by that traffic. This requires a dedicated VHF AIS transceiver that allows local traffic to be viewed on an AIS enabled chartplotter or computer monitor while transmitting information about the ship itself to other AIS receivers. Port authorities or other shore-based facilities may be equipped with receivers only, so that they can view the local traffic without the need to transmit their own location. All AIS transceivers equipped traffic can be viewed this way very reliably but is limited to the VHF range, about 10–20 nautical miles.\n\nIf a suitable chartplotter is not available, local area AIS transceiver signals may be viewed via a computer using one of several computer applications such as ShipPlotter and Gnuais. These demodulate the signal from a modified marine VHF radiotelephone tuned to the AIS frequencies and convert into a digital format that the computer can read and display on a monitor; this data may then be shared via a local or wide area network via TCP or UDP protocols but will still be limited to the collective range of the radio receivers used in the network.\nBecause computer AIS monitoring applications and normal VHF radio transceivers do not possess AIS transceivers, they may be used by shore-based facilities that have no need to transmit or as an inexpensive alternative to a dedicated AIS device for smaller vessels to view local traffic but, of course, the user will remain unseen by other traffic on the network.\n\nA secondary, unplanned and emerging use for AIS data is to make it viewable publicly, on the internet, without the need for an AIS receiver. Global AIS transceiver data collected from both satellite and internet-connected shore-based stations are aggregated and made available on the internet through a number of service providers. Data aggregated this way can be viewed on any internet-capable device to provide near global, real-time position data from anywhere in the world. Typical data includes vessel name, details, location, speed and heading on a map, is searchable, has potentially unlimited, global range and the history is archived. Most of this data is free of charge but satellite data and special services such as searching the archives are usually supplied at a cost. The data is a read-only view and the users will not be seen on the AIS network itself.\nShore-based AIS receivers contributing to the internet are mostly run by a large number of volunteers. AIS mobile apps are also readily available for use with Android, Windows and iOS devices. See \"External links\" below for a list of internet-based AIS service providers. Ship owners and cargo dispatchers use these services to find and track vessels and their cargoes while marine enthusiasts may add to their photograph collections.\n\nThe 2002 IMO SOLAS Agreement included a mandate that required most vessels over 300GT on international voyages to fit a Class A type AIS transceiver. This was the first mandate for the use of AIS equipment and affected approximately 100,000 vessels.\n\nIn 2006, the AIS standards committee published the Class B type AIS transceiver specification, designed to enable a simpler and lower-cost AIS device. Low-cost Class B transceivers became available in the same year triggering mandate adoptions by numerous countries and making large-scale installation of AIS devices on vessels of all sizes commercially viable. \n\nSince 2006, the AIS technical standard committees have continued to evolve the AIS standard and product types to cover a wide range of applications from the largest vessel to small fishing vessels and life boats. In parallel, governments and authorities have instigated projects to fit varying classes of vessels with an AIS device to improve safety and security. Most mandates are focused on commercial vessels, with leisure vessels selectively choosing to fit. In 2010 most commercial vessels operating on the European Inland Waterways were required to fit an Inland waterway certified Class A, all EU fishing boats over 15m will have to have a Class A by May 2014, and the US has a long-pending extension to their existing AIS fit rules which is expected to come into force during 2013. It is estimated that as of 2012, some 250,000 vessels have fitted an AIS transceiver of some type, with a further 1 million required to do so in the near future and even larger projects under consideration. \n\nAIS was developed in the 1990s as a high intensity, short-range identification and tracking network and, at the time, it was not anticipated to be detectable from space. Nevertheless, since 2005, various entities have been experimenting with detecting AIS transmissions using satellite-based receivers and, since 2008, companies such as exactEarth, Orbcomm, Spacequest, Spire and also government programs have deployed AIS receivers on satellites. The Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) radio access scheme used by the AIS system creates significant technical issues for the reliable reception of AIS messages from all types of transceivers: Class A, Class B, Identifier, AtoN and SART. However, the industry is seeking to address these issues through the development of new technologies and over the coming years the current restriction of satellite AIS systems to Class A messages is likely to dramatically improve with the addition of Class B and Identifier messages.\n\nThe fundamental challenge for AIS satellite operators is the ability to receive very large numbers of AIS messages simultaneously from a satellite's large reception footprint. There is an inherent issue within the AIS standard; the TDMA radio access scheme defined in the AIS standard creates 4,500 available time-slots in each minute but this can be easily overwhelmed by the large satellite reception footprints and the increasing numbers of AIS transceivers, resulting in message collisions, which the satellite receiver cannot process. Companies such as exactEarth are developing new technologies such as ABSEA, that will be embedded within terrestrial and satellite-based transceivers, which will assist the reliable detection of Class B messages from space without affecting the performance of terrestrial AIS.\n\nThe addition of satellite-based Class A and B messages could enable truly global AIS coverage but, because the satellite-based TDMA limitations will never match the reception performance of the terrestrial-based network, satellites will augment rather than replace the terrestrial system.\n\nShipboard AIS transceivers have a horizontal range that is highly variable, but typically only up to about . They reach much further vertically – up to the 400 km orbit of the International Space Station (ISS).\nIn November 2009, the STS-129 space shuttle mission attached two antennas—an AIS VHF antenna, and an Amateur Radio antenna—to the Columbus module of the ISS. Both antennas were built in cooperation between ESA and the ARISS team (Amateur Radio on ISS). Starting from May 2010 the European Space Agency is testing an AIS receiver from Kongsberg Seatex (Norway) in a consortium led by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment in the frame of technology demonstration for space-based ship monitoring. This is a first step towards a satellite-based AIS-monitoring service.\n\nIn 2009, Orbcomm launched AIS enabled satellites in conjunction with a US Coast Guard contract to demonstrate the ability to collect AIS messages from space. In 2009, Luxspace, a Luxembourg-based company, launched the RUBIN-9.1 satellite (AIS Pathfinder 2). The satellite is operated in cooperation with SES and REDU Space Services. In late 2011 and early 2012, Orbcomm and Luxspace launched the Vesselsat AIS microsatellites, one in an equatorial orbit and the other in a polar orbit. (VesselSat-2 and VesselSat-1)\n\nIn 2007, the U.S. tested space-based AIS tracking with the TacSat-2 satellite. However, the received signals were corrupted because of the simultaneous receipt of many signals from the satellite footprint.\n\nIn July 2009, SpaceQuest launched AprizeSat-3 and AprizeSat-4 with AIS receivers. These receivers were successfully able to receive the U.S. Coast Guard's SART test beacons off of Hawaii in 2010. In July 2010, SpaceQuest and exactEarth of Canada announced an arrangement whereby data from AprizeSat-3 and AprizeSat-4 would be incorporated into the exactEarth system and made available worldwide as part of their exactAIS(TM)service.\n\nOn July 12, 2010, The Norwegian AISSat-1 satellite was successfully launched into polar orbit. The purpose of the satellite is to improve surveillance of maritime activities in the High North. AISSat-1 is a nano-satellite, measuring only 20x20x20 cm, with an AIS receiver made by Kongsberg Seatex. It weighs six kilograms and is shaped like a cube.\n\nOn 20 April 2011, Indian Space Research Organisation launched Resourcesat-2 containing a S-AIS payload for monitoring maritime traffic in the Indian Ocean Search & Rescue (SAR) zone. AIS data is processed at National Remote Sensing Centre and archived at Indian Space Science Data Centre.\n\nOn February 25, 2013—after one year launch delay—Aalborg University launched AAUSAT3. It is a 1U cubesat, weights 800 grams, solely developed by students from the Department of Electronic Systems. It carries two AIS receivers—a traditional and a SDR-based receiver. The project was proposed and sponsored by the Danish Maritime Safety Administration. It has been a huge success and has in the first 100 days downloaded more than 800,000 AIS messages and several 1 MHz raw samples of radio signals. It receives both AIS channels simultaneously and has received class A as well as class B messages. Cost including launch was less than €200,000.\n\nCanadian-based exactEarth's AIS satellite network provides global coverage using 8 satellites. Between January 2017 and January 2019, this network was significantly expanded through a partnership with L3Harris Corporation with 58 hosted payloads on the Iridium NEXT constellation. Additionally exactEarth is involved in the development of ABSEA technology which will enable its network to reliably detect a high proportion of Class B type messages, as well as Class A.\n\nOrbcomm operates a global satellite network that includes 18 AIS-enabled satellites. Orbcomm's OG2 (Orbcomm Generation 2) satellites are equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime navigational and safety efforts, and download at Orbcomm's sixteen existing earth stations around the globe.\n\nIn July 2014, Orbcomm launched the first 6 OG2 satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Each OG2 satellite carries an AIS receiver payload. All 6 OG2 satellites were successfully deployed into orbit and started sending telemetry to Orbcomm soon after launch. In December 2015, the company launched eleven additional AIS-enabled OG2 satellites aboard the SpaceXFalcon 9 rocket. This dedicated launch marked Orbcomm's second and final OG2 mission to complete its next-generation satellite constellation. Compared to its current OG1 satellites, Orbcomm 's OG2 satellites are designed for faster message delivery, larger message sizes and better coverage at higher latitudes, while increasing network capacity.\n\nIn August 2017, Spire Global Inc. released an API that delivers S-AIS data enhanced with machine learning (Vessels and Predict) backed by its 40+ constellation of nano-satellites.\n\nCorrelating optical and radar imagery with S-AIS signatures enables the end-user to rapidly identify all types of vessel. A great strength of S-AIS is the ease with which it can be correlated with additional information from other sources such as radar, optical, ESM, and more SAR related tools such as GMDSS SARSAT and AMVER. Satellite-based radar and other sources can contribute to maritime surveillance by detecting all vessels in specific maritime areas of interest, a particularly useful attribute when trying to co-ordinate a long-range rescue effort or when dealing with VTS issues.\n\nThe original purpose of AIS was solely collision avoidance but many other applications have since developed and continue to be developed. AIS is currently used for:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAIS transceivers automatically broadcast information, such as their position, speed, and navigational status, at regular intervals via a VHF transmitter built into the transceiver. The information originates from the ship's navigational sensors, typically its global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver and gyrocompass. Other information, such as the vessel name and VHF call sign, is programmed when installing the equipment and is also transmitted regularly. The signals are received by AIS transceivers fitted on other ships or on land based systems, such as VTS systems. The received information can be displayed on a screen or chart plotter, showing the other vessels' positions in much the same manner as a radar display. Data is transmitted via a tracking system which makes use of a Self-Organized Time Division Multiple Access (STDMA) datalink designed by Swedish inventor Håkan Lans.\n\nThe AIS standard comprises several substandards called \"types\" that specify individual product types. The specification for each product type provides a detailed technical specification which ensures the overall integrity of the global AIS system within which all the product types must operate. The major product types described in the AIS system standards are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAIS receivers are not specified in the AIS standards, because they do not transmit. The main threat to the integrity of any AIS system are non-compliant AIS transmissions, hence careful specifications of all transmitting AIS devices. However, it is well to note that AIS transceivers all transmit on multiple channels as required by the AIS standards. As such single-channel, or multiplexed, receivers will not receive all AIS messages. Only dual-channel receivers will receive all AIS messages.\n\nAIS is a technology which has been developed under the auspices of the IMO by its technical committees. The technical committees have developed and published a series of AIS product specifications. Each specification defines a specific AIS product which has been carefully created to work in a precise way with all the other defined AIS devices, thus ensuring AIS system interoperability worldwide. Maintenance of the specification integrity is deemed critical for the performance of the AIS system and the safety of vessels and authorities using the technology. As such most countries require that AIS products are independently tested and certified to comply with a specific published specification. Products that have not been tested and certified by a competent authority, may not conform to the required AIS published specification and therefore may not operate as expected in the field. The most widely recognized and accepted certifications are the R&TTE Directive, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, and Industry Canada, all of which require independent verification by a qualified and independent testing agency.\n\nThere are 27 different types of top level messages defined in ITU M.1371-5 (out of a possibility of 64) that can be sent by AIS transceivers.\n\nAIS messages 6, 8, 25, and 26 provide \"Application Specific Messages\" (ASM), that allow \"competent authorities\" to define additional AIS message subtypes. There are both \"addressed\" (ABM) and \"broadcast\" (BBM) variants of the message. Addressed messages, while containing a destination MMSI, are not private and may be decoded by any receiver. \n\nOne of the first uses of ASMs was the Saint Lawrence Seaway use of AIS binary messages (message type 8) to provide information about water levels, lock orders, and weather. The Panama Canal uses AIS type 8 messages to provide information about rain along the canal and wind in the locks. In 2010, the International Maritime Organization issued Circular 289 that defines the next iteration of ASMs for type 6 and 8 messages. Alexander, Schwehr and Zetterberg proposed that the community of competent authorities work together to maintain a regional register of these messages and their locations of use. The International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA-AISM) now established a process for collection of regional application-specific messages.\n\nEach AIS transceiver consists of one VHF transmitter, two VHF TDMA receivers, one VHF Digital Selective Calling (DSC) receiver, and links to shipboard display and sensor systems via standard marine electronic communications (such as NMEA 0183, also known as IEC 61162). Timing is vital to the proper synchronization and slot mapping (transmission scheduling) for a Class A unit. Therefore, every unit is required to have an internal time base, synchronized to a global navigation satellite system (e.g. GPS) receiver. This internal receiver may also be used for position information. However, position is typically provided by an external receiver such as GPS, LORAN-C or an inertial navigation system and the internal receiver is only used as a backup for position information. Other information broadcast by the AIS, if available, is electronically obtained from shipboard equipment through standard marine data connections. Heading information, position (latitude and longitude), \"speed over ground\", and rate of turn are normally provided by all ships equipped with AIS. Other information, such as destination, and ETA may also be provided.\n\nAn AIS transceiver normally works in an autonomous and continuous mode, regardless of whether it is operating in the open seas or coastal or inland areas. AIS transceivers use two different frequencies, VHF maritime channels 87B (161.975 MHz) and 88B (162.025 MHz), and use 9.6 kbit/s Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) modulation over 25 kHz channels using the High-level Data Link Control (HDLC) packet protocol. Although only one radio channel is necessary, each station transmits and receives over two radio channels to avoid interference problems, and to allow channels to be shifted without communications loss from other ships. The system provides for automatic contention resolution between itself and other stations, and communications integrity is maintained even in overload situations.\n\nIn order to ensure that the VHF transmissions of different transceivers do not occur at the same time, the signals are time multiplexed using a technology called Self-Organized Time Division Multiple Access (SOTDMA). The design of this technology is patented, and whether this patent has been waived for use by SOLAS vessels is a matter of debate between the manufacturers of AIS systems and the patent holder, Håkan Lans. Moreover, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) canceled all claims in the original patent on March 30, 2010.\n\nIn order to make the most efficient use of the bandwidth available, vessels that are anchored or moving slowly transmit less frequently than those that are moving faster or are maneuvering. The update rate ranges from 3 minutes for anchored or moored vessels, to 2 seconds for fast moving or maneuvering vessels, the latter being similar to that of conventional marine radar.\n\nEach AIS station determines its own transmission schedule (slot), based upon data link traffic history and an awareness of probable future actions by other stations. A position report from one station fits into one of 2,250 time slots established every 60 seconds on each frequency. AIS stations continuously synchronize themselves to each other, to avoid overlap of slot transmissions. Slot selection by an AIS station is randomized within a defined interval and tagged with a random timeout of between 4 and 8 minutes. When a station changes its slot assignment, it announces both the new location and the timeout for that location. In this way new stations, including those stations which suddenly come within radio range close to other vessels, will always be received by those vessels.\n\nThe required ship reporting capacity according to the IMO performance standard is a minimum of 2,000 time slots per minute, though the system provides 4,500 time slots per minute. The SOTDMA broadcast mode allows the system to be overloaded by 400 to 500% through sharing of slots, and still provides nearly 100% throughput for ships closer than 8 to 10 nmi to each other in a ship to ship mode. In the event of system overload, only targets further away will be subject to drop-out, in order to give preference to nearer targets, which are of greater concern to ship operators. In practice, the capacity of the system is nearly unlimited, allowing for a great number of ships to be accommodated at the same time.\n\nThe system coverage range is similar to other VHF applications. The range of any VHF radio is determined by multiple factors, the primary factors are: the height and quality of the transmitting antenna and the height and quality of the receiving antenna. Its propagation is better than that of radar, due to the longer wavelength, so it is possible to reach around bends and behind islands if the land masses are not too high. \"The look-ahead\" distance at sea is nominally . With the help of repeater stations, the coverage for both ship and VTS stations can be improved considerably.\n\nThe system is backward compatible with digital selective calling systems, allowing shore-based GMDSS systems to inexpensively establish AIS operating channels and identify and track AIS-equipped vessels, and is intended to fully replace existing DSC-based transceiver systems.\n\nShore-based AIS network systems are now being built up around the world. One of the biggest fully operational, real time systems with full routing capability is in China. This system was built between 2003 and 2007 and was delivered by Saab TranspondereTech. The entire Chinese coastline is covered with approximately 250 base stations in hot-standby configurations including seventy computer servers in three main regions. Hundreds of shore based users, including about twenty-five vessel traffic service (VTS) centers, are connected to the network and are able to see the maritime picture, and can also communicate with each ship using SRM's (Safety Related Messages). All data are in real time. The system was designed to improve the safety and security of ships and port facilities. It is also designed according to an SOA architecture with socket based connection and using IEC AIS standardized protocol all the way to the VTS users. The base stations have hot-standby units (IEC 62320-1) and the network is the third generation network solution.\n\nBy the beginning of 2007, a new worldwide standard for AIS base stations was approved, the IEC 62320-1 standard. The old IALA recommendation and the new IEC 62320-1 standard are in some functions incompatible, and therefore attached network solutions have to be upgraded. This will not affect users, but system builders need to upgrade software to accommodate the new standard. A standard for AIS base stations has been long-awaited. Currently ad-hoc networks exist with class A mobiles. Base stations can control the AIS message traffic in a region, which will hopefully reduce the number of packet collisions.\n\nAn AIS transceiver sends the following data every 2 to 10 seconds depending on a vessel's speed while underway, and every 3 minutes while a vessel is at anchor:\n\n\nIn addition, the following data are broadcast every 6 minutes:\n\nClass B transceivers are smaller, simpler and lower cost than Class A transceivers. Each consists of one VHF transmitter, two VHF Carrier Sense Time Division Multiple Access (CSTDMA) receivers, both alternating as the VHF Digital Selective Calling (DSC) receiver, and a GPS active antenna. Although the data output format supports heading information, in general units are not interfaced to a compass, so this data is seldom transmitted. Output is the standard AIS data stream at 38.400 kbit/s, as RS232 and/or NMEA formats. To prevent overloading of the available bandwidth, transmission power is restricted to 2 W, giving a range of about 5–10 mi.\n\nFour messages are defined for class B units:\n\n\nA number of manufacturers offer AIS receivers, designed for monitoring AIS traffic. These may have two receivers, for monitoring both frequencies simultaneously, or they may switch between frequencies (thereby missing messages on the other channel, but at reduced price). In general they will output RS232, NMEA, USB or UDP data for display on electronic chart plotters or computers.\n\nAIS uses the globally allocated Marine Band channels 87 & 88.\n\nAIS uses the high side of the duplex from two VHF radio \"channels\" (87B) and (88B)\n\nThe simplex channels 87A and 88A use a lower frequency so they are not affected by this allocation and can still be used as designated for the maritime mobile frequency plan.\n\nMost AIS transmissions are composed of bursts of several messages. In these cases, between messages, the AIS transmitter must change channel.\n\nBefore being transmitted, AIS messages must be NRZI encoded.\n\nAIS messages are transmitted using GMSK modulation. The GMSK modulator BT-product used for transmission of data should be 0.4 maximum (highest nominal value).\n\nThe GMSK coded data should frequency modulate the VHF transmitter. The modulation index should be 0.5.\n\nThe transmission bit rate is 9600bit/s\n\nOrdinary VHF receivers can receive AIS with the filtering disabled (the filtering destroys the GMSK data). However, the audio output from the radio would need to be then decoded. There are several PC applications that can do this.\n\nAs there are a multitude of automatic equipment transmitting AIS messages, to avoid conflict, the RF space is organized in frames. Each frame lasts exactly 1 minute and starts on each minute boundary. Each frame is divided into 2250 slots. As transmission can happen on 2 channels, there are 4500 available slots per minute. Depending on the type and status of equipment and the status of the AIS slot map, each AIS transmitter will send out messages using one of the following schemes:\n\n\nThe ITDMA access scheme allows a device to pre-announce transmission slots of non-repeatable character, ITDMA slots should be marked so that they are reserved for one additional frame. This allows a device to pre-announce its allocations for autonomous and continuous operation.\n\nITDMA is used on three occasions:\n\nRATDMA is used when a device needs to allocate a slot, which has not been pre-announced. This is generally done for the first transmission slot, or for messages of a non-repeatable character.\n\nFATDMA is used by base stations only. FATDMA allocated slots are used for repetitive messages.\n\nSOTDMA is used by mobile devices operating in autonomous and continuous mode. The purpose of the access scheme is to offer an access algorithm which quickly resolves conflicts without intervention from\ncontrolling stations.\n\nAn AIS slot is 26.66 ms long. The data modulation is 9600 bit/s, so each slot has a maximum capacity of 256 bits. The framing is derived from the HDLC standard, described in ISO/IEC 13239:2002.\n\nEach slot is structured as such:\ncodice_1\n\n\nNote that the signal on the VHF carrier is NRZI encoded and uses bit-stuffing to avoid unintentional stop-flags which may otherwise occur in the data. As such, the raw bits must first be decoded, and the stuffing bits removed, to arrive at the actual usable message format described above.\n\nAll AIS messages transmit 3 basic elements of information:\n\nThe following table gives a summary of all the currently used AIS messages.\nAIS equipment exchange information with other equipment using NMEA 0183 sentences.\n\nThe NMEA 0183 standard uses two primary sentences for AIS data\n\nTypical NMEA 0183 standard AIS message: codice_2\n\nIn order: \nDue to the unauthenticated and unencrypted nature of AIS, recently \"Balduzzi, Pasta, Wilhoit et al.\" showed that AIS is vulnerable to different threats like spoofing, hijacking and availability disruption. These threats affect both the implementation in online providers and the protocol specification, which make the problems relevant to all transponder installations (estimated at 300,000+).\n\nThere is a growing body of literature on methods of exploiting AIS data for safety and optimisation of seafaring, namely traffic analysis, anomaly detection, route extraction and prediction, collision detection, path planning, weather routing and many more \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1825707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825707", "title": "2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup", "text": "2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup\n\nThe 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup was the second edition of the ICC Intercontinental Cup, a cricket competition for (then) 12 nations from Asia, Africa, North America and Europe. All the games were scheduled for three days and were designated first class.\n\nThe teams played each other team in each of the four groups once. The winners of each group progressed to a semi-final from 23 to 25 October, and then a final from 27 to 29 October, hosted by Namibia. The groups were as follows:\n\n\nThe United States were going to compete in the North American group, but were expelled from the competition by the ICC because of ongoing political problems within cricket in the US.\n\nThe tournament was won by Ireland who defeated\nKenya in the final.\n\nThe competition was run by the International Cricket Council to support the development of the longer form of the game in 12 of its associate members. The points system had been determined so as to encourage positive play. For instance, there were 14 points for a win, and the first innings was restricted to 90 overs, which can encourage attacking play as a team approaches the 90 over mark. In the event of a tie (i.e. all wickets down in the last innings with the scores being equal) each side was awarded 7 points.\n\nBonus points for batting were available for every 25 runs scored. There was no limit to how many points can be scored in the first innings, but batting points were restricted to 4 points (300 runs) in the second. 0.5 points were available for every wicket taken.\n\n22–24 April: Kenya (32pts) beat Uganda (15pts) by 168 runs\n\nThe 2005 competition finally got underway on 22 April the Lugogo Stadium in Kampala. The Kenyan team was just starting to recover from the tremendous upheavals and political difficulties that have racked the Kenyan Cricket Association. This had led to their match against Namibia, which was scheduled to begin on 26 February to be put back to 2 June. With the old-look side restored, Kenya were clear favourites again.\n\nOn the first day, Kenya scored 321 in an innings dominated by their veteran captain Steve Tikolo, who scored 149. However, the only real support he got was from Modi (56). In reply, Uganda were struggling at 37 for 3 at stumps. The second day saw continued Kenyan domination. Odoyo took 5 for 34 as Uganda subsided for 168. The ball was certainly on top as Kenya's second innings teetered to 85 for 6, with one day left to play. On the final day, Kenya were all out for 116, setting a target of 270. This was more than beyond them as Onyango took 6 for 21 to skittle the Ugandans for 108. \n\n14–16 May: Namibia (31.5pts) beat Uganda (17pts) by 3 wickets\n\nUganda won the toss and elected to bat at Lugogo Stadium, Kampala, and were quickly struggling on 9 for 2. Wickets fell regularly throughout the first day, which also saw an interruption for rain and curtailed by bad light. Namibia bowled well, with Gerrie Snyman taking 3 for 45. Uganda finished the first day on 225 for 9, mostly thanks to Franco Nsubuga, who scored 64. On the second day, Uganda were all out for 231, before dismissing Namibia for 201, which was somewhat of a recovery after they fell to 66 for 6. Namibia then took 5 quick wickets to wrest the advantage from the Ugandans when time was called at 60 for 5.\n\nOn the final day, Uganda rallied with Olweny (25), Kwebiha (39), Nsubuga (28) and Kishore (22*) helping the Ugandan total to 211 for 9 declared. Namibia then went for their target, always losing wickets along the way. But half-centuries from AJ Burger, Swanepoel and Kotze finally saw them through with 3 wickets remaining. Namibia now go on to meet Kenya in what will be the deciding match of the African group. Uganda are eliminated. \n\n3–5 June: Kenya (17pts) drew with Namibia (15pts)\n\nWith only half a point separating the two teams, it was not surprising that Kenya declared on 300 for 6, as soon as they had secured maximum first innings batting points, and with 8 potential balls left before their 90 overs were up. Namibia instead chose to bat on to take a first innings lead at 335 for 9 declared, with Burger making 87 and Snyman 75. By the end of the second day, Kenya were 112 for 2 in reply - scoring useful points as the game looked to be heading for a draw. By the time they declared on 282 for 9, with Suji top-scoring on 72, they had set a theoretical target of 248, and they looked as though they would sneak it on points. By the time they had reduced Namibia to 68 for 5, they had secured their semi-final qualification. \n\n24–26 April: United Arab Emirates (30pts) beat Hong Kong (12.5pts) by 7 wickets\n\nHong Kong, making their ICC Intercontinental Cup debut, showed their inexperience in Sharjah. The first day saw them dismissed for 127, with the UAE moving to 126 for 7 by close. They only added onto their score on the second day, to leave the game as a tie on first innings. Hong Kong were then dismissed cheaply again, this time for 184, and then let the UAE move to 144 for 3 at close. The game ended early on the third day, with no more wickets falling. The UAE had taken only 46 overs to knock off the runs. \n\n30 April-2 May: Nepal (8.5pts) drew with Hong Kong (5.5pts)\n\nIn Kathmandu, the first day was abandoned without a ball being bowled. The second day was also severely hampered by rain, but there was time for the Nepalis to bowl Hong Kong out for 91 after putting them into bat. The third and final day allowed for 54 overs, in which Nepal scored 101 for 7 declared and Hong Kong moved to 37 for 3 as Nepal tried to pick up as many points as possible before their group decider with the United Arab Emirates. \n\n7–9 May: Nepal (32pts) beat the United Arab Emirates (11pts) by 172 runs\n\nNepal won the toss in Kathmandu and batted first. After losing two quick wickets they consolidated and finished a rain-affected first day on 246 for 5. On day two they declared on 287 for 7. Nepal's bowlers then performed well, dismissing the United Arab Emirates for 164, with Arshad Ali carrying his bat for 81. In reply, Nepal proceeded to 45 for 2 by stumps on the second day. On the third and final day, Nepal declared on 125 for 6. Binod Das then took 5 for 27 to help dismiss the Emiratis for 76.\n\nAnd so, despite Nepal clearly showing their dominance in the group they do not progress to the next round. Nepal thrashed UAE and were well on top against Hong Kong but, because their game against Hong Kong was ravaged by rain, they do not progress to the semi-finals in Namibia. Whether the ICC will change the points system because of this is yet to be seen. \n\n29–31 July: Netherlands (5.5pts) drew with Scotland (4pts)\n\nThe Scots went into this tournament as favourites, being holders of the Intercontinental Cup and the ICC Trophy. However, rain in Utrecht prevented them from a good start against the Dutch, who bowled well enough to have them all out for 217 on the first day. Ian Stanger hit his second first-class fifty and Ryan Watson 46, but South African-born Ryan ten Doeschate took three important, albeit expensive, wickets and medium-pacer Edgar Schiferli finished with four for 46. In reply, Maurits van Nierop lashed out, taking 24 off the Scottish bowlers as the Dutch made 31 for 0 to see them to stumps on day 1. Play was impossible on the next two days, and the Scots now needed to thump Ireland in Aberdeen if they were to have any hope of qualifying for the semi-finals.\n13–15 August: Ireland (30.5pts) beat Scotland (17pts) by three runs\n\nThe start of the match at Aberdeen was delayed due to rain, but when it did get underway, Ireland immediately got into trouble. The first two partnerships didn't add a single run, four batsmen departed for ducks, and Craig Wright got four wickets for the hosting Scots. Ireland crumbled to 128 for 9 before 17-year-old Greg Thompson from Lisburn hit 35 from number 10 to become the top scorer of the innings. Steven Knox hit 38 for the Scots, however, as they moved to 104 for 2. Tight bowling frustrated the Scots, who were looking for quick runs, but at least Cedric English hit 66 to lift them to 234 - a lead of 62. Ryan Watson and Dewald Nel got a wicket each before stumps, the Irish second innings score 46 for 2. Dominic Joyce, brother of more famous Ed, came to the crease as the new batsman on the third morning, and he scored 61 before being lbw to Dewald Nel - a crucial innings. The rest of the batsmen stuck in, defending against Paul Hoffmann, who bowled 18 overs for 33 runs, but only got the one wicket.\n\nThe Scots - needing a victory after the wash-out in Utrecht against the Dutch - went after the target. But the former Essex bowler, Adrian McCoubrey, took four for 17 as the Scots crashed to 34 for four, and despite 31 not out from Craig Wright, his two last partners were both run out, and Scotland finished on 131 - four runs short of victory. Thus, the finalists of the last tournament were knocked out before the last game.\n23–25 August: Ireland (11pts) drew with Netherlands (6pts)\n\nThe first day of the match at Stormont, Belfast was rained off, and Ireland, knowing that plenty of runs would give them enough to see them through to the semi-finals, chose to bat out 90 overs. The entire top order contributed with half-centuries and centuries - Jeremy Bray top scoring 135 - as the Dutch bowlers were slaughtered, debutant Ernst van Giezen taking two for 107 as the best bowler. Ireland declared on 407 for 4, having realised they could get no more points, and immediately dug into the Dutch top order. A recovery was staged thanks to a 115-run stand between Ryan ten Doeschate and Alexei Kervezee, but when Andre Botha took two wickets the Dutch realised the futility of their task. The match was eventually abandoned as a draw, which sent Ireland into the semi-finals of the tournament.\n\n23–25 August: Bermuda (30.5pts) beat Canada (17.5pts) by 48 runs\n\nBermuda pulled off a narrow victory over Canada in Toronto to leave them favourites to win the Americas group. Canada won the toss and put Bermuda into bat, a decision that was soon vindicated as their guests were skittled for 125 in 59.5 overs, with only Clay Smith (52) and Janeiro Tucker (25) putting up any sort of resistance. The damage was done by Canada's 21-year-old left-arm medium pace bowler, Umar Bhatti, who got 8 for 40. By the end of the first day, Canada had already overhauled this total, and were on 149 for 6. The innings closed on the second day at 207, of which 76 were made by Ashish Bagai. Bermuda did better in their second innings, mostly due to Tucker's 123 that helped swing the game. By the time they had finished their innings they had 311 on the board and a defendable lead of 229. Early wickets saw the hosts collapse to 17 for 4 before a recovery took them to 164 for 6. A final push by Bermuda saw them all out for 181, and put the Bermudians in control of the group: a win in their next game would see them in the semi-finals. Scorecard\n\n27–29 August: Bermuda (31.5pts) beat Cayman Islands (8.5pts) by an innings and 105 runs\n\nCayman Islands got off to a good start in their first Intercontinental Cup match in their history - indeed, their inaugural first class match. Amid rains at Toronto, they made their way to 109 for 1, before Bermudian off spinner Dwayne Leverock unleashed himself on the Cayman batting line-up. In 27 overs he took five for 56, playing a major part in dismissing the Caymans for 197 just before rain stopped play on day one. On day two, however, Bermuda took over, with captain Clay Smith making 138 and Irving Romaine scoring 111 as the team raced to 387 for 7. Kevin Hurdle then took two wickets in five expensive overs as the Caymans were 50 for 4 at the second day's close of play. It took 14 overs for Leverock and Bermuda to wrap up the Cayman innings for 85, thus taking 31.5 points and assuring themselves of a semi-final spot. Leverock finished with match figures of eleven for 72, the best figures in the tournament so far this year.\n31 August-2 September: Canada (33.5pts) beat Cayman Islands (14.5pts) by 120 runs\n\nCanada dominated proceedings at Toronto, getting the win but not getting enough points to qualify for the semi-finals.

The channel primarily broadcasts live-action programming aimed at youth audiences.\n\nThe youth channel TVJQ () went on the air in 1982 and was distributed by a subsidiary of Vidéotron. It was originally available only in the Montreal and Quebec City areas. \n\nIn 1986, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) granted a license to Vidéotron for its TVJQ channel to be carried over by other cable companies elsewhere. This made Vidéotron the first cable company in Canadian history to simultaneously be a producer of television content. However, TVJQ was intended to be temporary until a permanent channel for children would succeed it. \n\nLicensed by the CRTC in 1987, Le Canal Famille was launched on September 1, 1988 as a replacement to TVJQ. Le Canal Famille was created by Premier Choix TVEC which itself was already partially owned at the time by Astral Media (the predecessor of Bell Media).\n\n\"Le Canal Famille\", name translated as \"The Family Channel\", which was the name of another Canadian youth channel that also began airing in 1988, as well as YTV (owned by Corus Entertainment).\n\nLe Canal Famille was renamed VRAK.TV on January 2, 2001. The channel switched to an ad-supported format in 2006 to coincide with the renewal of license and launch of HD feed.\n\nVrak.TV was separated from its sister channels in 2013 due to the acquisition of Astral Media by Bell Media; Bell sold off Family Channel, the French version of Disney Junior, the English version of Disney Junior and Disney XD to DHX Media in 2014.\n\nVrak.TV was simply renamed to just Vrak on August 25, 2014. \n\nOn September 12, 2016, Vrak changed its audience focus to the ages 13-35 group due to the success of its \"Vrak2\" block. Some series targeting its former audience focus moved to other stations.\n\nSince its creation as Le Canal Famille, the channel airs animated series, teen sitcoms and light-hearted dramas. Many of them are French dubs of English-language programs such as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"Charmed\", \"What I Like About You\", \"Degrassi: The Next Generation\", \"Gilmore Girls\", \"One Tree Hill\", \"The O.C.\", \"Life with Derek\", \"Smallville\", \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", \"That '70s Show\", \"90210\", \"Gossip Girl\", and many others. It also aired programs from Disney Channel; due to the launch of La chaîne Disney by Corus Entertainment, the last remaining Disney Channel show on the channel, \"Good Luck Charlie\" (\"Bonne chance Charlie\" in French), was removed from the schedule in September 2016. The channel also features local Quebec French language productions, such as \"Il était une fois dans le trouble\" and \"Une grenade avec ça?\". Other series that the channel popularized were \"Dans une galaxie près de chez vous\" and \"Radio Enfer\". As of 2010, the channel has aired films weekly.\n\nInitially, as required by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the channel carried no commercials until 2006. However, it aired promotional messages, interstitial programs (such as help segments known as \"R-Force\" (pronounced like \"Air Force\")), and public service announcements instead. The channel airs commercials as of 2006 with the launch of its HD feed and license renewal.\n\nUnlike the other specialty channels, Vrak is the only channel on the air daily from 6am to midnight. When the station was Le Canal Famille, the station would close down at 7pm (8pm on weekends), sharing time with the flagship Super Écran channel (then also owned by Astral and now sharing Bell Media ownership with Vrak). In 2001, when the channel was revamped as VRAK.TV, its hours were increased to 10 p.m. (Super Écran followed on most systems). Vrak's current closedown time at midnight went into effect in mid-2005.\n\nOn September 12, 2016, due to the channel's changes in audience focus, its animation programming completely disappeared from the channel, eventually, they reappeared on the channel in January 2017, starting with \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" (\"Bob l'éponge\" in French).\n\nSince May 2019, all remaining children programming on the channel has completely disappeared.\n\nOn October 30, 2006, Astral Media launched an HD simulcast of Vrak.TV called \"Vrak.TV HD\".\n\nIt is available on Bell TV, Bell Fibe TV, Cogeco, Optik TV, Rogers Cable, Shaw Direct and Vidéotron.\n\n\n"}

She grew up in New York City then later migrated to Colombia, where she became a pageant titleholder. As Miss Colombia, she was crowned the first Miss International in 1960.\n\nAraneta was the former national director of the Miss Universe and current director for Miss International franchises in the Philippines, under the Binibining Pilipinas organization. She is also the \"Charge d'affaires\" of the Colombian embassy in the country, having served as chairman of the Binibining Pilipinas Charities Incorporated for fifty years.\n\nMarquez was born in Tumaco, Colombia to Arturo Eduardo Marquez Acevedo (Tumaco, Colombia 1910—1981) and Stella Zawadski Navia (Valle del Cauca, Colombia 1920—1974) and later migrated to the United States in 1954. She is the eldest sibling of two younger sisters. At the time, she was a high school student at Marymount School of New York in Manhattan. Initially, her father, working as a civil engineer decided to take her out of the school to Colombia on a promise of temporary vacation. As a young student, Marquez classified herself as a Gringa, noting that she was completely unable to relate to the Colombian culture, including its national dance Cumbia.\n\nAfter high school, Marquez enrolled in Marymount College, Tarrytown, New York to continue her major both in psychology and the French language. In 1957, Marquez gained an honorary prize as a beauty model for Pan American Airlines, though not necessarily a pageant contest. She also represented as Miss Honduras on a local Los Angeles pageant due to its lack of national entry. During that time, she was also sent by the nuns from her school as one of the “court princesses” for the 1957 homecoming event in Loyola Marymount University as a gesture of solidarity among affiliated Catholic schools for women.\n\nDuring her stay in Colombia, Marquez learned the value of social work and became acquainted with the local Roman Catholic Church there to fund charities. The first charity she helped manage was named \"\"Banquet of the Millionaires\"\" through the assistance of a famed Catholic priest, Father Rafael García Herreros (1909—1992). Marquez was chosen as the representative of her country in 1958 by winning three local titles, \"Miss Tumaco\", \"Miss Nariño\" and \"Miss Queen of Spain\". Her victory under the department state of Nariño was notable for not having sent a candidate in twelve years while her travel visa permit to stay in Colombia was limited to two months.\n\nDuring her national competition, Marquez used the Colombian national costume as a Sibundoy Indian princess, wearing a gold headband and a Ruana shawl as a veil. After winning Miss Colombia in 1959, she was personally congratulated and photographed with former Colombian president, Alberto Lleras Camargo.\n\nDuring the Miss Universe 1960 competition, the swimsuit assigned to her during her national competition was a one piece blue cerulean swimsuit with golden cleavage ornamentation (the other contestants were assigned yellow and pink). Ultimately, she competed and won the title for \"Senorita Colombia\", gaining her access to become the national Colombian representative in Miss Universe 1960 (Top 15 Placement) at 6th-Runner up, then to Miss International 1960 (Winner Placement) of which she won against Miss India, Iona Pinto of Maharashtra by a score margin of half a point (0.5).\n\nPrior to her marriage, Márquez is a Colombian woman of Spanish and Polish heritage. She became Miss Colombia in 1959 and was, therefore, able to compete in the Miss Universe 1960 pageant held in Miami Beach, Florida placing as a top 15 semi-finalist, at 6th—runner up placement.\n\nAccordingly, Colombia sent her again as a national representative through the financial patronage of Max Factor cosmetics. As part of the promotional entourage group, she was given a tour with Conrad Hilton Sr. at the new renovation of the Beverly Hilton hotel. Hilton Sr. himself, jokingly asked Marquez if she would consider marrying his firstborn son and hotel heir Conrad Hilton Jr. in case he divorces again from Patricia McClintock, which consequently occurred in 1965.\n\nAt age 23, Marquez competed in the first Miss International pageant held in Long Beach, California in 1960, becoming the first Miss International, and also the first Latin American titleholder in that line of pageants. During the press presentation at the former Lafayette Hotel, Marquez openly declared that she preferred to wear a figure-tight swimsuit that would showcase the pageant body she worked hard to achieve rather than the loose playsuits sponsored by the pageant organizers. She won the first evening gown competition out of the three rounds (1/3) at the pageant. Her measurements for the swimsuit competition which paved for her victory was recorded at 95—62—95 at exactly 170 centimeters. Ultimately, she won the title and received the following grand total prizes:\n\n\nAccordingly, after winning Miss International 1960, the President of Marymount College, Irish Mother Superior Brendan Marie McQuillan PhD. sent a formal letter to Marquez requesting her to choose a different school due to her active participation in pageantry, namely the swimsuit competition, deemed still taboo at the time.\n\nAfter her championship, Marquez decided to her use her fame to work and was hired as a tourist promoter for a European tour package company, as well as an endorser for the New Year’s Day 1961 Rose Bowl and 72nd Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena, California, where she also met her future husband, Jorge Leon Araneta. The parade float was titled \"Lovely to Look At\" and featured Marquez on top of large 17-foot tall fountain with surrounding nine basins of spraying water.\n\nShe married Jorge Leon Araneta, a Filipino businessman at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Saint Peter in Cali, Colombia, thereby sharing in five children. Their grand wedding reception was held in \"Hotel Alferez Real\", now extinct. When Araneta first arrived in Manila, she was dismayed that the country was similar to Hispanic cities and expected a more oriental culture similar to neighboring territories like British Hong Kong and Japan. She toured many parts of the Philippines, then organized by her husband through the Manila City Hall but notes that she was also dismayed at the wide practice of telephone tapping at the time, claiming that private telephone conversations between her husband would be reported in Filipino tabloids the next following day.\n\nDuring the Cold War in 1961, Marquez became fearful for her safety and decided to ship back to New York city her most precious belongings, the grand Piano of her mother, wedding dresses and wedding crown as well as her evening gown at Miss International 1960 along with its original crown and trophy for safekeeping at her sister's residence. Accordingly, the goods were heavily damaged due to the Hurricane Esther which wrecked the boat in transit.\n\nShe was assigned by her father-in-law Amado Araneta to the post in June 1964, on her 28th birthday. Since 1964, she has been the organizer of \"Binibining Pilipinas\" (Filipino: \"Maiden Philippines or Miss Philippines\"), which sends its winners to the Miss Universe and Miss International competitions. Araneta is also a principal sponsor to the wedding of \"Miss Philippines\" 2011 Shamcey Supsup. In 2019, after fifty years of service, Supsup succeeded Araneta for the national franchise of Miss Universe.\n\nAraneta’s tenure as a national director is not without controversy. Former pageant candidates have been known to be disqualified at her final decision, often as a result of an immorality clause in the pageant contracts associated with sexualized photos discovered in the media during or after the pageant or the inability to obtain or renew a Philippine passport.\n\nNotable among this is in 1982, when Maria Isabel Lopez claimed that she was pressured to relinquish her title due to her having worked as a sexy lingerie model in a “Gerard Peter Fashion Show” which was revealed post discovery. Nevertheless, Lopez maintained her tenacity and went to compete in at the 31st Miss Universe pageant. Similar cases of various other candidates occurred over the years, as disqualified for varying reasons ranging from sexualized photos irrespective of intent such as artistic creativity, charity purposes, or product endorsement (sexualized calendars) or direct self-pornography allegedly often without due process due to the immorality clause implemented by Araneta and her lawyers. Disqualified candidates such as Anjanette Abayari of USA (1991), Tisha Silang of Canada (1998) and Maria Venus Raj of Qatar (2010) due to issues of national citizenship having been born in Qatar and the lack of full set of citizenship documents causing the intervention of the Department of Foreign Affairs to make a controversial exception to grant a Philippine passport. Accordingly, Raj competed in 2010 and took placement as the 4th Runner Up in the 59th Miss Universe competition.\n\nOther notable issues were the refurbishment, restructuring or total re-usage of swimsuit and pageant gowns by candidates, along with the sourcing of evening and national gowns outside the Philippines. In contrast, Araneta maintained that she sourced the pageant gowns abroad due to the mediocrity of local Filipino designers yet noted to considering them in the future if having been re-qualified at a higher finesse and quality standard. After the controversial 2014 national costume worn by Mary Jean Lastimosa (Top 10 Placement), Filipino nationals were officially allowed to procure gowns and the national costume in 2015.\n\nOn 12 January 2017, Araneta expressed her disdain of Filipino designers producing any pageant gowns for other countries, deeming them as risk of competition to the national representative. In 2018, at the personal request of the 64th Miss Universe, Araneta designated new crowns and diadems for its national titleholders and the runner-up finalists.\n\nCurrently, Binibining Pilipinas owns the franchise of Miss International, Miss Supranational, Miss Intercontinental, Miss Grand International, and Miss Globe. In addition, Araneta is the \"Chargé d'affaires\" of the Consulate of Colombia to the Philippines in Manila.\n\nTo date, Araneta has produced four Miss Universe titleholders, six Miss International winners and numerous semi-finalists placements. Araneta has a fond novelty of collecting premium Emeralds, a gemstone highly valued in her native Colombia.\n\nIn 2013, Araneta was inducted to the Eastwood City Walk Of Fame in Quezon City, Philippines.\n\n"}

After a lengthy coaching career in the World Hockey Association and in the National Hockey League, Demers became an analyst for Montreal Canadiens games on RDS. On August 27, 2009, he was nominated by Prime Minister Stephen Harper to fill the Canadian Senate seat vacated by Yoine Goldstein. Senator Demers represented the Conservative Party in the Senate until December 2015 when he resigned from the Conservative caucus in order to sit as an Independent. On his 75th birthday on August 25th, 2019 Senator Demers left his position as Senator.\n\nTwo of the franchises Demers coached in the WHA were the Chicago Cougars and the Quebec Nordiques. Additionally, he was the exceedingly popular coach of the Indianapolis Racers, which won the Eastern Division championship under his guidance. Demers had the opportunity to coach Wayne Gretzky in the 1979 WHA All-Star Series. The format of the series was a three-game set that pitted the WHA All-Stars against HC Moscow Dynamo. Demers asked Gordie Howe if it was okay to put him on a line with Wayne Gretzky and his son Mark Howe. In Game One, the line scored seven points as the WHA All-Stars won by a score of 4–2. In Game Two, Gretzky and Mark Howe each scored a goal and Gordie Howe picked up an assist as the WHA won 4–2. The line did not score in the final game, but the WHA won by a score of 4–3.\n\nWhile in the NHL, he coached the Quebec Nordiques, St. Louis Blues, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens and Tampa Bay Lightning. He won two consecutive Jack Adams Awards as NHL Coach of the Year, with Detroit in both 1987 and 1988. He is the only person to win the award in consecutive years. He was also responsible for naming longtime Red Wing Steve Yzerman as team captain. In 1993, he led Montreal to its most recent Stanley Cup. Only two years later, however, the Canadiens missed the playoffs altogether for the first time since 1970. After an 0-5 start to the 1995-96 season, Demers was fired.\n\nWhile in Tampa Bay, he was responsible for guiding Vincent Lecavalier through his first two years in the NHL. He displayed a fatherly attitude toward the young star, often pulling him aside during practice to lecture him in their native French. During the 1998-99 season, he also served as the Lightning's general manager.\n\nIn 2007, he was named the 100th most influential personality in hockey by \"The Hockey News\".\n\nOn November 2, 2005, Demers released a biography, written by Mario Leclerc, entitled \"En toutes lettres\" (English translation: \"All Spelled Out\"), in which he revealed that he is functionally illiterate. According to Demers, he never really learned to read or write because of his abusive childhood in Montreal. He covered for himself by asking secretaries and public relations people to read letters for him, claiming he could not read English well enough to understand them (though he speaks English and French equally well). When he served as general manager of the Lightning, he brought in Cliff Fletcher and Jay Feaster as his assistants; as it turned out, they did most of the work a general manager would normally do because Demers knew he could not do it himself.\n\nOn August 28, 2009, CBC Radio One reported that Demers was chosen to fill the Senate seat of Yoine Goldstein by Prime Minister Harper. He is fluently bilingual. According to the CBC report, he has \"raised awareness about literacy issues\" by \"going public with his own struggles.\" A series of Montreal residents were interviewed regarding his Senate appointment and they were generally positive about the move. Many noted, however, that it was \"important that he learn to read.\"\n\nOn July 5, 2010, Demers was reported to be in stable condition after undergoing two emergency surgeries.\n\nDemers was hospitalized after experiencing a stroke in April 2016. He remained in stable condition in a Montreal hospital.\n\nIn October 2016, Demers was hospitalized for a serious infection.\n\n\n"}

He was admitted as a solicitor in 1971 and to the Faculty of Advocates in 1973. He served as an Advocate Depute from 1979 to 1983, and was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1985.

{"id": "1825754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825754", "title": "Kurmi", "text": "Kurmi\n\nKurmi is a Hindu cultivator caste of the eastern Gangetic plain in northern India.\n\nThere are several late-19th century theories of the etymology of \"Kurmi\". According to Jogendra Nath Bhattacharya (1896), the word may be derived from an Indian tribal language, or be a Sanskrit compound term \"krishi karmi\", \"agriculturalist.\" A theory of Gustav Salomon Oppert (1893) holds that it may be derived from \"kṛṣmi\", meaning \"ploughman\".\n\nRecords from the time indicate that within western Bihar, the Kurmis had cultivated an alliance with the ruling Ujjainiya Rajputs. Many leaders of the Kurmi community fought side by side with the Ujjainiya king, Kunwar Dhir when he rebelled against the Mughals in 1712. Among the recorded Kurmi community leaders who joined his revolt were Nima Seema Rawat and Dheka Rawat.\n\nWith the continued waning of Mughal rule in the early 18th century, the Indian subcontinent's hinterland dwellers, many of whom were armed and nomadic, began to appear more frequently in settled areas and interact with townspeople and agriculturists. Many new rulers of the 18th century came from such nomadic backgrounds. The effect of this interaction on India's social organization lasted well into the colonial period. During much of this time, non-elite tillers and pastoralists, such as the Kurmi, were part of a social spectrum that blended only indistinctly into the elite landowning classes at one end, and the menial or ritually polluting classes at the other.\n\nThe Kurmi were famed as market gardeners. In western and northern Awadh, for example, for much of the eighteenth century, the Muslim gentry offered the Kurmi highly discounted rental rates for clearing the jungle and cultivating it. Once the land had been brought stably under the plough, however, the land rent was usually raised to 30 to 80 per cent above the going rate. Although British revenue officials later ascribed the high rent to the prejudice among the elite rural castes against handling the plough, the main reason was the greater productivity of the Kurmi, whose success lay in superior manuring. According to historian Christopher Bayly, Whereas the majority of cultivators manured only the lands immediately around the village and used these lands for growing food grains, Kurmis avoided using animal dung for fuel and manured the poorer lands farther from the village (the \"manjha\"). They were able, therefore, to grow valuable market crops such as potatoes, melons and tobacco immediately around the village, sow fine grains in the \"manjha\", and restrict the poor millet subsistence crops to the periphery. A network of \"ganjs\" (fixed rural markets) and Kurmi or Kacchi settlements could transform a local economy within a year or two.\n\nCross-cultural influences were felt also. Hindu tillers worshipped at Muslim shrines in the small towns founded by their Muslim overlords. The Hindu Kurmis of Chunar and Jaunpur, for instance, took up the Muslim custom of marrying first cousins and of burying their dead. In some regions, the Kurmis' success as tillers led to land ownership, and to avowals of high status, as noted, for examples, by Francis Buchanan in the early 19th century among the Ayodhya Kurmis of the Awadh. Earlier, in the late eighteenth century, when Asaf-Ud-Dowlah, the fourth Nawab of Awadh, attempted to grant the kshatriya title of Raja to a group of influential landed Ayodhya Kurmis, he was thwarted by a united opposition of Rajputs, who were themselves (as described by Buchanan), \"a group of newcomers to the court, who had been peasant soldiers only a few years before ...\" According to historian William Pinch: Rajputs of Awadh, who along with brahmans constituted the main beneficiaries of what historian Richard Barnett characterizes as \"Asaf's permissive program of social mobility,\" were not willing to let that mobility reach beyond certain arbitrary socio-cultural boundaries. ... The divergent claims to status in the nineteenth century (and earlier) illustrate the point that for non-Muslims, while varna was generally accepted as the basis for identity, on the whole little agreement prevailed with respect to the place of the individual and the jati within a varna hierarchy.\n\nAlthough the free peasant farm was the mainstay of farming in many parts of north India in the 18th century, in some regions, a combination of climatic, political, and demographic factors led to the increased dependence of peasant cultivators such as the Kurmi. In the Benares division, which had come under the revenue purview of the British East India Company in 1779, the Chalisa famine of 1783 and the relentless revenue demand from the Company reduced the status of many Kurmi cultivators. A British revenue agent wrote in 1790, \"It unfortunately happened that during the famine aforesaid a great proportion of the Kurmis, Kacchis and Koeris were in this district as well as in others supplanted by Brahmans ... \" and bemoaned the loss of agricultural revenue in part due to, \"this unfavourable mutation amongst the cultivators ...\"\n\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century, economic pressures on the large landowning classes increased noticeably. The prices of agricultural lands fell at the same time that the East India Company, after acquiring the Ceded and Conquered Provinces (later the North-Western Provinces) in 1805, began to press landowners for more land revenue. The annexation of Awadh in 1856 created more fear and discontent among the landed elite, and may have contributed to the Indian rebellion of 1857. Economic pressures also opened marginal areas to intensive agriculture and turned the fortunes of the non-elite peasants, such as the Kurmi, who worked them. After the rebellion, the landowning classes, defeated but still pressed economically in the new British Raj, attempted to treat their tenants and labourers as people of lowly birth and to demand unpaid labour from them. According to historical anthropologist Susan Bayly, In some instances these were attempts to stave off decline by reinvigorating or intensifying existing forms of customary service. Elsewhere these were wholly novel demands, many being imposed on 'clean' tillers and cattle-keepers like the Ram- and Krishna-loving Koeris, Kurmis and Ahirs ... In either case, these calls were buttressed with appeals to Sanskritic varna theory and Brahmanical caste convention. ... Kurmi and Goala/Ahir tillers who held tenancies from these 'squireens' found themselves being identified as Shudras, that is, people who were mandated to serve those of the superior Kshatriya and Brahman varnas.\n\nThe elite landowning classes, such as Rajputs and Bhumihars, now sought to present themselves as flagbearers of the ancient Hindu tradition. At the same time, there was a proliferation of Brahmanical rituals in the daily life of the elite, a greater stress on pure bloodlines, more stringent conditions placed on matrimonial alliances, and, as noted by some social reformers of the day, an increase among the Rajputs of female infanticide, a practice that had little history among the Kurmi.\n\nThe second half of the nineteenth century also largely overlapped with the coming of age of ethnology—interpreted then as the science of race—in the study of societies the world over. Although later to be discredited, the methods of this discipline were eagerly absorbed and adopted in British India, as were those of the emerging science of anthropology. Driven in part by the intellectual ferment of the discipline and in part by the political compulsions in both Britain and India, two dominant views of caste emerged among the administrator-scholars of the day. According to Susan Bayly: Those like (Sir William) Hunter, as well as the key figures of H. H. Risley (1851–1911) and his protégé Edgar Thurston, who were disciples of the French race theorist Topinard and his European followers, subsumed discussions of caste into theories of biologically determined race essences, ... Their great rivals were the material or occupational theorists led by the ethnographer and folklorist William Crooke (1848–1923), author of one of the most widely read provincial \"Castes and Tribes\" surveys, and such other influential scholar-officials as Denzil Ibbetson and E. A. H. Blunt.\n\nSeeing caste as a fundamental force in Indian life, Risley, especially, influenced official views as expressed in both the Censuses of British India and the Imperial Gazetteer brought out by Hunter. Risley is best known for the now discounted attribution of all differences in caste to varying proportions of seven racial types which included \"Dravidian,\" \"Aryo-Dravidian,\" and \"Indo-Aryan\". The Kurmi fell into two such categories. In the ethnological map of India published in the 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India and based on the 1901 Census supervised by Risley, the Kurmi of the United Provinces were classified as \"Aryo-Dravidian,\" whereas the Kurmi of the Central Provinces were counted among \"Dravidians\". In the 1901 Census of India, the category of varna, the four-fold graded system, was included in the official classification of caste, the only time this was the case. In the United Provinces (UP), the Kurmi were classified under \"Class VIII: Castes from whom some of the twice-born would take water and \"pakki\" (food cooked with ghee), without question;\" whereas, in Bihar, they were listed under: \"Class III, Clean Sudra, Subclass (a).\" According to William Pinch, \"Risley's hierarchy (for United Provinces) was far more elaborate than that for Bihar, suggesting that contending claims of social respectability may have been more deeply entrenched in the western half of the Gangetic Plain.\"\n\nIn the writings of the occupational theorists, the Kurmis and the Jats came to be extolled for their yeoman-like purposefulness, tirelessness, and thrift, all of which, according to writers such as Crooke, Ibbetson, and Blunt had been largely abandoned by the landed elite. Crooke wrote about the Kurmi in 1897: They are about the most industrious and hard-working agricultural tribe in the Province. The industry of his wife has passed into a proverb: <br>\n\"Bhali jât Kurmin, khurpi hât,\" <br>\n\"Khet nirâwê apan pî kê sâth.\" <br>\n\"A good lot is the Kurmi woman; she takes her spud and weeds the field with her lord.\"\n\nAccording to Susan Bayly, By the mid-nineteenth century, influential revenue specialists were reporting that they could tell the caste of a landed man by simply glancing at his crops. In the north, these observers claimed, a field of 'second-rate barley' would belong to a Rajput or Brahman who took pride in shunning the plough and secluding his womenfolk. Such a man was to be blamed for his own decline, fecklessly mortgaging and then selling off his lands to maintain his unproductive dependents. By the same logic, a flourishing field of wheat would belong to a non-twice-born tiller, wheat being a crop requiring skill and enterprise on the part of the cultivator. These, said such commentators as Denzil Ibbetson and E. A. H. Blunt, were the qualities of the non-patrician 'peasant' – the thrifty Jat or canny Kurmi in upper India, ... Similar virtues would be found among the smaller market-gardening populations, these being the people known as Keoris in Hindustan, ...\n\nAs the economic pressures on the patrician landed groups continued through the remainder of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth, there were increasing demands for unpaid labour directed at the Kurmi and other non-elite cultivators. The landed elites' demands were couched in avowals of their ancient rights as \"twice-born\" landowners and of the Kurmi's alleged lowly, even servile, status, which required them to serve. At times encouraged by sympathetic British officials and at other times carried by the groundswell of egalitarian sentiment being espoused then by the devotional Vaishnava movements, especially those based on Tulsidas's \"Ramcharitmanas\", the Kurmi largely resisted these demands. Their resistance, however, did not take the form of denial of caste or of caste-based imposition, but rather of disagreement about where they stood in the caste ranking. A noteworthy attribute of the resulting Kurmi-kshatriya movement was the leadership provided by educated Kurmis who were now filling the lower and middle levels of government jobs. According to William Pinch: The mantle of leadership in this phase befell the well-connected Ramdin Sinha, a government forester who had gained notoriety by resigning from his official post to protest a provincial circular of 1894 that included Kurmis as a \"depressed community\" and barred them therefore from recruitment into the police service. The governor’s office was flooded with letters from an outraged Kurmi-kshatriya public and was soon obliged to rescind the allegation in an 1896 communique to the police department \"His Honor [the governor] is ... of the opinion that Kurmis constitute a respectable community which he would be reluctant to exclude from Government service.\"\n\nThe first Kurmi caste association had been formed in 1894 at Lucknow to protest against the police recruitment policy. This was followed by an organisation in Awadh that sought to draw other communities — such as the Patidars, Marathas, Kapus, Reddys and Naidus — under the umbrella of the Kurmi name. This body then campaigned for Kurmis to classify themselves as Kshatriya in the 1901 census and, in 1910, led to the formation of the All India Kurmi Kshatriya Mahasabha. Simultaneously, newly constituted farmers' unions, or \"Kisan Sabhas\"—composed of cultivators and pastoralists, many of whom were Kurmi, Ahir, and Yadav (Goala), and inspired by Hindu mendicants, such as Baba Ram Chandra and Swami Sahajanand Saraswati—denounced the Brahman and Rajput landlords as ineffective and their morality as false. In the rural Ganges valley of Bihar and Eastern United Provinces, the Bhakti cults of Rama, the incorruptible Kshatriya god-king of Hindu tradition, and Krishna, the divine cowherd of Gokul, had long been entrenched among the Kurmi and Ahir. The leaders of the \"Kisan Sabhas\" urged their Kurmi and Ahir followers to lay claim to the Kshatriya mantle. Promoting what was advertised as soldierly manliness, the \"Kisan Sabhas\" agitated for the entry of non-elite farmers into the British Indian army during World War I; they formed cow protection societies; they asked their members to wear the sacred thread of the twice-born, and, in contrast to the Kurmis own traditions, to sequester their women in the manner of Rajputs and Brahmins.\n\nIn 1930, the Kurmis of Bihar joined with the Yadav and Koeri agriculturalists to enter local elections. They lost badly but in 1934 the three communities formed the \"Triveni Sangh\" political party, which allegedly had a million dues-paying members by 1936. However, the organisation was hobbled by competition from the Congress-backed Backward Class Federation, which was formed around the same time, and by co-option of community leaders by the Congress party. The Triveni Sangh suffered badly in the 1937 elections, although it did win in some areas. The organisation also suffered from caste rivalries, notably the superior organisational ability of the higher castes who opposed it, as well as the inability of the Yadavs to renounce their belief that they were natural leaders and that the Kurmi were somehow inferior. Similar problems beset a later planned caste union, the \"Raghav Samaj\", with the Koeris.\n\nAgain in the 1970s, the India Kurmi Kshatriya Sabha attempted to bring the Koeris under their wing, but disunity troubled this alliance.\n\nMany private caste-based armies surfaced in Bihar between the 1970s and 1990s, largely influenced by landlord farmers reacting to the growing influence of left extremist groups. Among these was the Bhumi Sena, the membership of which was drawn mainly from youths who had a Kurmi origin. Bhumi Sena was much feared in the Patna region and also had influence in the districts of Nalanda, Jehanabad and Gaya.\n\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n"}

The walk is named after Cuthbert, a 7th-century saint, a native of the Borders who spent his life in the service of the church. The route links Melrose Abbey, where Cuthbert began his religious life, with his initial burial place on Holy Island. Cuthbert achieved the status of bishop, and was called a saint eleven years after his death, when his coffin was opened and his remains found to be perfectly preserved.\n\nThe route was first devised by Ron Shaw, and opened in summer 1996. Shaw continues to sit on the walk's steering group, which is responsible for managing the path. Other members of this group are Scottish Borders Council, Northumberland County Council, Northumberland National Park, and Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Beauty. The trail was originally developed as a walking route but some sections are suitable for cyclists and horseriders. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code permits cyclists and riders to use most of the trail in Scotland, but on the English section of the route this is generally not permitted. Similarly, wild camping along the route is permitted (if carried out responsibly) in Scotland, but not in England.\n\nAs of 2018 it was estimated that around 2,500 people completed the entire route each year.\n\nAlthough the majority of walkers travel from west to east it can be as easily walked in the reverse direction with good waymarking in both directions. The route starts at Melrose Abbey. It first climbs over the Eildon Hills to the village of Bowden, then turns east to Newtown St Boswells on the River Tweed opposite Dryburgh Abbey. It then follows the bank of the Tweed for downstream past St Boswells to Maxton. Near Maxton the trail joins Dere Street, which it follows south east past the site of the Battle of Ancrum Moor to Monteviot House on the banks of the River Teviot. \n\nFrom Monteviot Bridge the Way follows Dere Street for another 1 km, before striking east and climbing above the village of Crailing to reach Cessford. A short stretch of roadwalking follows to Morebattle, from where the trail leads south up the valley of Kale Water. south of Morebattle the Way climbs steeply to the ridge of Wideopen Hill, the highest point of the trail at , before descending to the villages of Town Yetholm and Kirk Yetholm, where it meets the Pennine Way.\n\nThe route in Scotland is part of the E2 European long distance path, which runs for from Galway to Nice.\n\nThe border ridge is reached east of Kirk Yetholm. On the English side the trail descends through the Northumberland National Park to the village of Hethpool in the College Valley. The trail then climbs through the foothills of the Cheviot Hills, passing just south of the hillforts of Yeavering Bell and Humbleton Hill, to the town of Wooler.\n\nFrom Wooler the Way ascends the valley of the River Till to the twin villages of West Horton and East Horton. It then follows farmland tracks to St. Cuthbert's Cave near Holburn. Near the cave it joins St Oswald's Way and the Northumberland Coast Path (part of the England Coast Path) to head north through Fenwick to the coast just east of Beal. The last section across the sands to Lindisfarne (Holy Island) can only be walked at low tide, either by the modern road or by the historic, more direct, Pilgrims Path, marked by posts.\n\nThe route is designated as one of Scotland's Great Trails by Scottish Natural Heritage, and links with two other Great Trails: the Borders Abbeys Way and the Southern Upland Way. In England, St Cuthbert's Way connects with the Pennine Way, one of the National Trails of England and Wales, but is not itself classified as National Trail. The Way also links to St Oswald's Way, the England Coast Path, the Roman Heritage Way and the Sir Walter Scott Way.\n\n"}

He wrote under the pseudonym Flanor.\n\nHe studied law at the University of Leiden, obtaining a degree in 1851, and was for many years Deputy Recorder to the High Court of Justice in his native town, \"an office he resigned in 1873, in order to devote himself wholly to art and letters.\"\nHis first volume of poems, 1860, did not contain much that was remarkable. His temperament was starved in the very thin air of the intellectual the Netherlands of those days, and it was not until after the sensational appearance of Multatuli (pen name of Edward Douwes-Dekker) that Vosmaer, at the age of forty, woke up to a consciousness of his own talent. In 1869 he produced an exhaustive monograph on Rembrandt, which was issued in French.\n\nVosmaer became a contributor to, and then the leading spirit and editor of, a journal which played an immense part in the awakening of Dutch literature; this was the Nederlandsche Spectator, in which a great many of his own works, in prose and verse, originally appeared. The remarkable miscellanies of Vosmaer, called \"Birds of Diverse Plumage\", appeared in three volumes, in 1872, 1874 and 1876. In 1879 he selected from these all the pieces in verse, and added other poems to them. In 1881 he published an archaeological novel called \"Amazone\", described as an \"art-novel\", the scene of which was laid in Naples and Rome, and which described the raptures of a Dutch antiquary in love. The sculptor Aktol, with his studio in the Baths of Diocletian, is based on Moses Jacob Ezekiel. It was translated into French, German, Belarusian, and an English translation was published in 1884.\n\nVosmaer undertook the gigantic task of translating Homer into Dutch hexameters, and he lived just long enough to see this completed and revised. In 1873 he came to London to visit his lifelong friend, Lawrence Alma-Tadema, and on his return published \"Londinias\", an exceedingly brilliant mock-heroic poem in hexameters. His last poem was \"Nanno\", an idyll on the Greek model. Vosmaer died, while travelling in Switzerland, on June 12, 1888.\n\nHe was unique in his fine sense of plastic expression; he was eminently tasteful, lettered, relined. Without being a genius, he possessed immense talent, just of the order to be useful in combating the worn-out rhetoric of Dutch poetry. His verse was modelled on Heine and still more on the Greeks; it is sober, without colour, stately and a little cold. He was a curious student in versification, and it is due to him that hexameters were introduced and the sonnet reintroduced into the Netherlands. He was the first to repudiate the traditional, wooden alexandrine. In prose he was greatly influenced by Multatuli, in praise of whom he wrote an eloquent treatise, \"Een Zaaier\" (A Sower). He was also somewhat under the influence of English prose models.\n\n"}

A stone cross situated in Vossevangen is said to have been erected at this time. The town contains the stone Voss Church from 1277, with a 16th-century eccentric, octagonal steeple. Just outside the village is \"Finnesloftet\", a wooden guildhall believed to be the oldest profane (non-sacred) wooden building in Northern Europe.\n\nAfter the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, Voss was the main point of mobilisation for the Norwegian Army in the west, as the city of Bergen had already fallen on the first day of the invasion. Although most of the troops mobilised here were transferred by railway to the fighting in the east of the country. The German forces, advancing towards Voss along the railway line from Bergen and from the Hardangerfjord, were met with stiff resistance. In Hardanger (to the south), some of the Germans climbed up the mountains from Ålvik while the rest went through Granvin.\n\nTo break down this resistance, the village of Vossevangen was bombed by the Luftwaffe on 24 and 25 April 1940. About a dozen civilians lost their lives in the bombing which completely destroyed the old wood-built town centre.

Today, many Jews accept the theory of evolution and do not see it as incompatible with traditional Judaism, reflecting the emphasis of prominent rabbis such as the Vilna Gaon and Maimonides on the ethical rather than factual significance of scripture.\n\nMany rabbis believe that God completed the creation of the world close to 6,000 years ago. This view is based on a chronology developed in a midrash, \"Seder Olam\", which was based on a literal reading of the Book of Genesis. It is attributed to the Tanna Yose ben Halafta, and covers history from the creation of the universe to the construction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. Since there is no explicit discussion in the classical era, it is commonly presumed that they took Genesis 1 literally, making the beginning of the world six days earlier, but this is presumption in the absence of data.\n\nSome modern rabbis believe that the world is older. They believe such a view is needed to accept scientific theories, such as the theory of evolution. Rabbis who have this view base their conclusions on verses in the Talmud or in the midrash. For example:\n\n\nIn his commentary on the Torah, Rabbi Bahya ben Asher (11th century, Spain) concludes that there were many time systems occurring in the universe long before the spans of history that man is familiar with. Based on the Kabbalah he calculates that the Earth is billions of years old.\n\nSome medieval philosophical rationalists, such as Maimonides and Gersonides held that not every statement in Genesis is meant literally. In this view, one was obligated to understand Torah in a way that was compatible with the findings of science. Indeed, Maimonides, one of the great rabbis of the Middle Ages, wrote that if science and Torah were misaligned, it was either because science was not understood or the Torah was misinterpreted. Maimonides argued that if science proved a point that did not contradict any fundamentals of faith, then the finding should be accepted and scripture should be interpreted accordingly. For example, in discussing Plato's view that the universe has existed literally forever, he argued that there was no convincing rational proof one way or the other, so that he (Maimonides) was free to accept, and therefore did accept, the literal Biblical view that the universe came into being at a definite time; but that had Plato's Theory been convincing enough with sufficient scientific proof he would have been able to reinterpret Genesis accordingly. With regard to Genesis, Maimonides stated that \"the account given in scripture is not, as is generally believed, intended to be in all its parts literal.\" Later in the same paragraph, he specifically states that this applies to the text from the beginning to the account of the sixth day of creation.\n\nNahmanides, often critical of the rationalist views of Maimonides, pointed out (in his commentary to Genesis) several non-sequiturs stemming from a literal translation of the Bible's account of Creation, and stated that the account actually symbolically refers to spiritual concepts. He quoted the Mishnah in Tractate Hagigah which states that the actual meaning of the Creation account, mystical in nature, was traditionally transmitted from teachers to advanced scholars in a private setting. Many classic Kabbalistic sources mention \"Shmitot\" - cosmic cycles of creation, similar to the Indian concept of yugas. Nahmanides' disciple, Rabbi Isaac of Akko, a prominent Kabbalist of 13th-century, held that the Universe is about 15 billion years old. According to the tradition of \"Shmitot\", Genesis talks openly only about the current epoch, while the information about the previous cosmic cycles is hidden in the esoteric reading of the text.\n\nA literal interpretation of the biblical Creation story among classic rabbinic commentators is uncommon. Thus Bible commentator Abraham Ibn Ezra (11th Century) wrote,\n\n\"If there appears something in the Torah which contradicts reason…then here one should seek for the solution in a figurative interpretation…the narrative of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for instance, can only be understood in a figurative sense.\"\n\nOne of several notable exceptions may be the Tosafist commentary on Tractate Rosh Hashanah, where there seems to be an allusion to the age of creation according to a literal reading of Genesis. The non-literal approach is accepted by many as a possible approach within Modern Orthodox Judaism and some segments of Haredi Judaism.\n\nRashi, while his commentary on the verses describing the days of creation teaches them as literal days, brackets his discussion of Genesis ch. 1 with comments stating that the entire world was created at once, with no duration of existence before Adam being specified.\n\nIn the 13th century, Rabbi Isaac ben Samuel of Acre made the insight that, since Sabbatical cycles existed before man was created, time before Adam and Eve must be measured in divine years, not human years. Psalm 90:4 says, \"For a thousand years in thy sight are but like yesterday when it is past, and like a watch in the night.\" Rabbi Isaac of Akko - who held like Livnat Ha-Sapir, that we are in the seventh Sabbatical cycle - therefore took the above figure of 42,000 years and multiplied it by 365,250 (he was using a 365.25-day year) to get 15,340,500,000 years for the age of the universe when Adam was created.\n\nWith the advent of Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory, the Jewish community found itself engaged in a discussion of Jewish principles of faith and modern scientific findings.\n\nRabbi Elijah Benamozegh, an Italian Kabbalist, changed his position over time with respect to evolutionary theory. His views went through three stages, corresponding to his engagement with ideas of transmutation in three key works, namely, the Hebrew biblical commentary \"Em leMikra\" (1862-65), the Italian theological treatise, \"Teologia Dogmatica e Apologetica\" (1877), and his posthumous great work in French, \"Israël et l’humanité\" (1914). Benamozegh came to view Darwin’s account of the common descent of all life as evidence in support of kabbalistic teachings, which he synthesized to offer a majestic vision of cosmic evolution, with radical implications for understanding the development of morality and religion itself. In the context of the creation-evolution debate in Europe, Benamozegh’s significance is as the earliest traditionalist Jewish proponent of a panentheistic account of evolution. From the time of his earliest work on the subject, he wrote that were evolution to become a mainstay of scientific theory, it would not contradict the Torah as long as one understood it as having been guided by God. \n\nRabbi Israel Lipschitz of Danzig (19th century) gave a famous lecture on Torah and paleontology, which is printed in the \"Yachin u-Boaz\" edition of the Mishnah, after Massechet Sanhedrin. He writes that Kabbalistic texts teach that the world has gone through many cycles of history, each lasting for many tens of thousands of years. He links these teachings to findings about geology from European, American and Asian geologists, and from findings from paleontologists. He discusses the wooly mammoth discovered in 1807 Siberia, Russia, and the remains of several then-famous dinosaur skeletons recently unearthed. Finding no contradiction between this and Jewish teachings, he states \"From all this, we can see that all the Kabbalists have told us for so many centuries about the fourfold destruction and renewal of the Earth has found its clearest possible confirmation in our time.\"\n\nWhen scientists first developed the theory of evolution, this idea was seized upon by rabbis such as Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin, known as the Netziv, who saw Kabbalah as a way to resolve the differences between traditional readings of the Bible and modern day scientific findings. He proposed that the ancient fossils of dinosaurs were the remains of beings that perished in the previous \"worlds\" described in midrash and in some Kabbalistic texts. This was the view held by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan (1934–1983).\n\nIn the late 1880s, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, an influential leader in the early opposition to non-Orthodox forms of Judaism, wrote that while he did not endorse the idea of common descent (that all life developed from one common organism), even if science ever did prove the factuality of Evolution, it would not pose a threat to Orthodox Judaism's beliefs. He posited that belief in Evolution could instead cause one to be more reverent of God by understanding His wonders (a master plan for the universe).\n\nBy the early to mid-1900s, the majority of Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism came to accept the existence of evolution as a scientific fact. They interpreted Genesis and related Jewish teachings in light of this fact.\n\nThe proponents of Reform or progressive forms of Judaism had consistently claimed since the early nineteenth-century that they sought to reconcile Jewish religion with the best of contemporary scientific thought. The science of evolution was arguably the scientific idea that drew the most sustained interest. A good example is the series of twelve sermons published as \"The Cosmic God\" (1876) by the founder of American Reform Judaism, Isaac Meyer Wise, who offered an alternative theistic account of transmutation to that of Darwinism, which he dismissed as ‘homo-brutalism’. Other Reform rabbis who were more sympathetic to Darwinian conceptions of evolution were Kaufmann Kohler, Emil G. Hirsch, and Joseph Krauskopf. These engaged with high profile sceptics and atheists such as Robert Ingersoll and Felix Adler as well as with proponents of biological evolutionary theory, with the result that a distinctly panentheistic character of US Reform Jewish theology was observable. Emil G. Hirsch wrote:\n\nSimilarly, Joseph Krauskopf wrote:\n\nLucien Wolf (1857-1930) was a celebrated journalist, diplomat, and communal authority, acting as a committee member of the conjoint committee of the Anglo-Jewish Association and the British Board of Deputies, the two representative bodies of Anglo-Jewry. He wrote ‘What is Judaism? A Question of To-day’ in \"The Fortnightly Review\" (1884) in response to the biological-racist anti-Semitism of Goldwin Smith, and accepted Smith’s premises (that the Jews were a biological race shaped by a religion that was, in its essence, merely legalism), with a strategy had been to attempt to reverse the value judgment. Wolf understood evolution in the strongly progressive sense that was common to much Victorian thought, with the environment selecting for traits that would maximize racial hygiene and permanently and continually improve the character of the Jewish race over time. Wolf asserted that ‘the optimism of Judaism’ as ‘expressed in “legalism”’ gave Jews a 30% or 40% advantage over those of other religions and creeds, and not only explained their survival over the ages but actually represented an important moment in the story of human evolution. The ‘wisdom and power’ of Judaism had enabled it to ‘accomplish of itself a distinct step in the history of the human species.’\n\nJoseph Jacobs (1854-1916) was a writer and social scientist appointed to Jewish Theological Seminary in New York towards the end of his life. He produced pioneering cross-disciplinary work in history, statistics, and race science, and was a student of anthropology at the Statistical Laboratory at University College London in the 1880s under the eugenicist Francis Galton. Jacobs was one for whom Judaism and Jewish identity made no sense apart from evolutionary thought. He offered an evolutionary account of Jewish history that suggested branching developments within the Jewish religion, and he explored the issue of Jewish race and peoplehood from both anthropological and sociological perspectives as a means by which to confront the anti-Semitic stereotypes of his day. He compiled measurements of skulls sizes, analyzed nose shapes, and carefully tabulated various vital statistics, wealth distribution, and even genius per capita in his application of the eugenic science of Galton, his tutor. For example, in attempting to explain the high number of children per Jewish family, Jacobs tentatively suggested that this could be explained by the relatively high frequency of marriages between cousins, which he hazarded were more fertile than mixed marriages. The high proportion of male births, which Jacobs noted that Darwin had commented upon in his \"Descent of Man\", however exaggerated by poor statistics, nevertheless appeared to be ‘one of the few biostatical phenomena which seem to be distinctively racial.’ Despite this, Jacobs insisted that the over-arching framework and context for his pursuit of the quantitative science was always a qualitative historical one, and one might therefore argue that, as such, his work represents the first truly interdisciplinary answer to the question: what is a Jew? \n\nBoth Wolf and Jacobs presented Judaism as a case study for the investigation of the role of religion in human evolution, thereby humanizing and universalizing the Jew at the same time. Both men believed that by viewing Jewish religion through the prism of evolutionary theory they could construe Jewish difference in such a way as to counter the threat to assimilation posed by racial antisemitism.\n\nMordecai Kaplan (1881–1983) and Hans Jonas (1903–1993) were two influential Jewish religious thinkers of the twentieth century who engaged seriously with scientific knowledge and, in particular, with Darwinism. The writings of two twentieth-century New York-based religious thinkers shared a common concern to find an alternative approach to the problem of evil in general and to the religious challenge of the Shoah in particular. \n\nFor Kaplan, the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, it was possible to draw upon his already well-developed, scientifically augmented (or inspired) revisions of the Jewish religion and the Jewish God. Kaplan’s writings from the 1930s onwards manifest an interest in evolution in at least four different although related contexts. First, evolution, in the sense of development or change, is used as a justification for Kaplan’s reconstructionist project; Judaism is a living organism transforming and adapting to its changing environment. Second, evolution is presented as a divine process or principle that brings order out of chaos, in the sense of the volution of the cosmos. Third, the biological evolution of mankind. The evolution of plant and animal life, including human life, by means of Darwinian natural selection was a given, as far as Kaplan was concerned, although there is no doubt that in his mind natural selection was inadequate to explain human evolution in its entirety—or, at least, those aspects of human evolution that Kaplan was most interested in, namely, the ethics of a community. This led him to develop his theory of “spiritual selection,” which added a complementary—and competing—force for selection to the mix of evolutionary pressures that shaped human evolution, including natural selection and sexual selection. Fourth, Kaplan discusses evolution in relation to what we would now call Social Darwinism, that is, the application of a theoretical framework for organic biology to human society, and in particular the Nazi theory of race competition. Kaplan, as one might expect, is hostile to such ideologies, but his key reason is that they threaten to undermine his understanding of humans as partners with the divine in bringing meaning and order to the universe.\n\nFor the philosopher of technology, Jonas, the revisions to the traditional categories of Jewish theology arguably followed from his struggle to make some kind of moral sense of the Holocaust in the light of his interest in the biological emergence of selfhood. For Jonas, Darwin’s key contribution was to raise the value of non-human life: \"The affront to human dignity posed by the [Darwinian] theory of man’s descent from animals provoked outrage, but this reaction overlooked the fact that the same principle restored a degree of dignity to the phenomenon of life as a whole. If man is related to the animals, then the animals are also related to man and therefore, in degrees, possess that inwardness which man, their most highly advanced relative, is aware of in himself.\" In a 1968 essay entitled “The Concept of God After Auschwitz: A Jewish Voice” he envisions a God who, in the beginning and for unknowable reasons, had committed Himself to a cosmic experiment in “chance and risk and [the] endless variety of becoming.” This God, who contained the cosmos but was not to be identified with it, as is made explicit in an earlier version, had created it by establishing the physical and biological laws that unfolded over time and space without any divine direction or correction and without foreknowledge of how it would develop. The cosmos was left to itself, to play out according to natural laws and probability, with God having withdrawn Himself completely from the process. Following the surprising emergence of life (described as “the world accident for which the becoming deity had waited”), blind evolutionary forces had eventually generated the human mind with its capacity for “knowledge and freedom,” that is, for moral choice. The dead cosmos became the living cosmos, and the living cosmos became the moral cosmos. With the human, the organism had moved beyond existence-for-its-own-sake to existence-for-the-sake-of-others, that is, an existence premised upon responsibility for others and for the cosmos itself, which had given birth to life and morality (as he puts it: “self-fulfilling life has given way to the charge of responsibility”). According to this account, God had found a partner in creation, in that the universe would no longer develop only according to the amoral natural laws by which He had established it, but could be radically altered by the self-aware, self-determined actions of humans, whether these deeds took place in ethical or material dimensions. To the extent that God was to be regarded as the ground of all being, containing the cosmos within Himself, those human deeds that shaped the world also affected God: “In the awesome impact of his deeds on God’s destiny … lies the immortality of man.” By the time Jonas arrives at a consideration of the Holocaust, he is able to explain God’s silence at Auschwitz as the necessary consequence of the Creator’s absence from His creation.\n\nAt the heart of the visions of both Kaplan and Jonas was a kind of cosmic evolutionism that necessitated an understanding of the origins of human ethics from an evolutionary perspective. While neither could be said to have demonstrated an intimate understanding of Darwinian theory, both viewed themselves as critically engaged with it and sought to utilize Darwin in offering accounts of a genocidal world that were neither entirely naturalistic nor entirely supernatural.\n\nThe Rabbinical Council of America (RCA) has \"maintained that evolutionary theory, properly understood, is not incompatible with belief in a Divine Creator, nor with the first 2 chapters of Genesis.\" Prominent Orthodox rabbis who have affirmed that the world is older, and that life has evolved over time include Israel Lipschitz, Sholom Mordechai Schwadron (the MaHaRSHaM) (1835–1911), Zvi Hirsch Chajes (1805–1855) and Abraham Isaac Kook (1865–1935). (Kook was interested in evolution partly as a bridge between religious and secular Zionists.) These rabbis proposed their own versions of theistic evolution, in which the world is older, and that life does evolve over time in accord with natural law, painting natural law as the process by which God drives the world.\n\nThere is, in parallel, a discussion on this subject by scientists in the Orthodox Jewish community. One of the most prominent is Gerald Schroeder, an MIT trained physicist. He has written a number of articles and popular books attempting to reconcile Jewish theology with modern scientific findings that the world is billions of years old and that life has evolved over time. His work has received approbations from a number of Orthodox rabbinic authorities. Other physicists writing on this topic include Alvin Radkowsky, Nathan Aviezer, Herman Branover, Cyril Domb, Aryeh Kaplan and Yehuda (Leo) Levi.\n\nVarious popular works, citing an array of classical, Orthodox views, attempt to reconcile traditional Jewish texts with modern scientific findings concerning evolution, the age of the earth and the age of the Universe; these include:\n\nConservative Judaism embraces science as a way to learn about the world, and, like Modern Orthodox and Reform Judaism, has not found the theory of evolution a challenge to traditional Jewish theology. The Conservative Jewish movement has not yet developed one official response to the subject, but a broad array of views has converged. Conservative Jews teach that God created the universe and is responsible for the creation of life within it, but proclaims no mandatory teachings about how this occurs.\n\nMany Conservative rabbis embrace the term theistic evolution, and reject the term intelligent design. Conservative rabbis who use the term \"intelligent design\" in their sermons often distinguish their views from the Christian use of the term. Like most in the scientific community, they understand \"intelligent design\" to be a technique by Christians to insert religion into public schools, as admitted in the Intelligent design movement's \"wedge strategy\".\n\nThe Central Conference of American rabbis is opposed to the teaching of creationism in public schools, as is the Rabbinical Assembly.\n\nConservative Judaism strongly supports the use of science as the proper way to learn about the physical world in which we live, and thus encourages its adherents to find a way to understand evolution in a way that does not contradict the findings of scientific research. The tension between accepting God's role in the world and the findings of science, however, is not resolved, and a wide array of views exists. Some mainstream examples of Conservative Jewish thought are as follows:\n\nProfessor Ismar Schorsch, former chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, writes that:\n\nRabbi David J. Fine, who has authorized official responsa for the Conservative movement's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, expresses a common Conservative Jewish view on the subject:\n\nRabbi Michael Schwab writes:\n\nThe claim that evolution is purposeful is in conflict with modern-day evolutionary theory. The precise way in which God inserts design is not specified by Schwab or other rabbis.\n\nRabbi Lawrence Troster is a critic of positions such as this. He holds that much of Judaism (and other religions) have not successfully created a theology which allows for the role of God in the world and yet is also fully compatible with modern-day evolutionary theory. Troster maintains that the solution to resolving the tension between classical theology and modern science can be found in process theology, such as in the writings of Hans Jonas, whose view of an evolving God within process philosophy contains no inherent contradictions between theism and scientific naturalism.\nIn a paper on Judaism and environmentalism, Troster writes:\n\nWhilst the Reform, Conservative and Modern Orthodox movements have stated that they feel there is not a conflict between evolutionary theory and the teachings of Judaism, some Haredi rabbis have remained staunchly opposed to certain teachings in evolutionary theory. In contrast with the literalist biblical interpretation of some Christian creationists, they express an openness to multiple interpretations of Genesis, through Jewish oral tradition and Jewish mysticism. They have also expressed an openness to evolutionary theory in biology, except where they perceive that it is in conflict with the Torah's account of creation.\n\nRabbi Avigdor Miller, a highly revered American Haredi rabbi of the Lithuanian Yeshivah Tradition, who was also highly respected in Hasidic communities such as Satmar, was strongly opposed to the theory of evolution, and wrote strong polemics against evolution in several of his books, as well as speaking about this subject often in his popular lectures, taking a Creationist position. Several selections from his books on this subject were collected in a pamphlet he published in 1995 called \"The Universe Testifies\".\n\nRabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Rebbe of the worldwide movement of Lubavitcher or Chabad Hasidism, was avidly opposed to evolution, and his following remains committed to that position.\n\nRabbi Avi Shafran, a spokesman for Agudath Israel, writes a weekly column that is widely syndicated in the Jewish press. As an opponent of Darwinian evolutionary theory, Shafran is careful to distinguish the Jewish perspective from that of Christian fundamentalism. He writes, \"An unfortunate side-effect of our affirmation of purpose in creation at a time of controversy is the assumption made by some that we believing Jews share some other groups’ broader skepticism of science. But while Torah-faithful Jews reject the blind worship of science, we do not regard science as an enemy.\" Quite the contrary, Shafran remarks, Judaism seeks to learn as much as possible from God's creation.\n\nShafran also rejects the literalism of Christian fundamentalism. He writes, \"Nor is 'Biblical literalism' a Jewish approach. Many are the \"p’sukim\" (verses) that do not mean what a simple reading would yield.\" To Shafran, the Jewish oral tradition is the key to the true meaning of the Torah's words. \"There are multiple levels of deeper meanings inaccessible to most of us. The words of \"Breishis\" (Genesis, Ashkenazi Hebrew) and the Midrashim thereon hide infinitely more than they reveal. It is clear that the Torah describes the creation of the universe as the willful act of \"HaKodosh Boruch Hu\" (the Holy One), and describes creation as having unfolded in stages. But details are hardly provided.\"\n\nSome contemporary Orthodox Jews writers are concerned that if evolution is accepted as true, then it could lead to the Torah being deemed not only irrelevant but also false. Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb has argued that for Jews accepting evolution is equivalent to accepting atheism. The Israeli microbiologist Morris Goldman has written that Darwinism is a problem for Judaism, since Darwinism makes god irrelevant. Other issues are that evolution can provide a non religious basis for the development of morality, and it removes the idea that humans are qualitatively different from other animals.\n\nIn 2004-2005, three popular books by Rabbi Natan Slifkin (sometimes pronounced \"Nosson\" Slifkin) were banned by a group of Haredi rabbinic authorities on the grounds that they were heretical. Known to his admirers as the \"Zoo Rabbi,\" Nosson Slifkin was the author of \"The Torah Universe\", a series of books on science and religion that were widely read in Orthodox communities until they were suddenly banned. \"The books written by Nosson Slifkin present a great stumbling block to the reader,\" the ban declared. \"They are full of heresy, twist and misrepresent the words of our sages and ridicule the foundations of our \"emunah\" (faith).\" The ban, which prohibited Jews from reading, owning, or distributing Slifkin's books, prompted a widespread backlash in the Orthodox Jewish community.\n\nJennie Rothenberg, reporting on this ban in the secular Jewish journal, \"Moment\", asserted that the incident represents a major breaking point within ultra-Orthodox society. Rothenberg interviewed several rabbis who wished to remain anonymous. According to one of them, \"Over the past 15 years, the rabbis of Bnai Brak and the more open American ultra-Orthodox rabbis have been split on a number of important policy decisions. The Slifkin ban is a huge break. It’s a kind of power struggle, and those who didn’t sign the ban are outraged right now. I’m talking about rabbis with long white beards who are furious about it.\" Slifkin's views, according to this rabbi, are shared by countless figures within the ultra-Orthodox community. \"He’s saying out loud what a lot of people have been talking about quietly all along. To those people, he’s a kind of figurehead.\"\n\nSeveral Modern Orthodox Jewish scientists have interpreted creation in light of both modern scientific findings and rabbinical interpretations of Genesis. Each of these scientists have claimed that modern science actually confirms a literal interpretation of Torah. All of them accept the scientific evidence that the age of the Earth and the age of the universe are on a scale of billions of years, and all of them acknowledge that the diversity of species on Earth can be explained through an evolutionary framework. However, each of them interprets certain aspects of evolution or the emergence of modern humans as a divine process, rather than a natural one. Thus, each of them accepts an evolutionary paradigm, while rejecting some aspects of Darwinism. Shai Cherry writes, \"While twentieth century Jewish theologians have tended to compartmentalize science and the Torah, our Modern Orthodox physicists synthesized them.\n\n\nShai Cherry, Professor of Jewish Thought at Vanderbilt University, remarks that these Modern Orthodox scientists have rejected the approach taken by Jewish theologians. Theologians have tended to use later writings, such as Midrash and Kabbalah, to reconcile modern science with Genesis. The Orthodox scientists, by comparison, have largely ignored Jewish theology, in favor of a fundamentalist and literalist interpretation of Genesis. Yet in their writings, each of them seeks to reconcile science with Genesis. Cherry speculates, \"They were targeting an American Jewish community that privileges science over Torah as a source of scientific knowledge. If Genesis could be shown to have anticipated Darwin or Einstein, then the Bible would regain an aura of truth that it had been losing since the advent of biblical criticism and modern science.\"\n\nAccording to Cherry, the books of Aviezar, Schroeder, and Landa have each sought to strengthen Orthodox Jewry in a time of mounting secularization. Aviezar and Schroeder sought to prove that Genesis anticipates the findings of modern science, and thus increase its status. By contrast, Landa sought to remove a barrier to Orthodox commitment, by proving to secular Jews that Orthodox Judaism and modern science are compatible. At the same time, he sought to persuade students in his own Orthodox community that the study of science is not incompatible with commitment to Orthodoxy.\n\nNathan Robertson a researcher in Biophysics has also released a book titled \"The First Six Days\" which claims to reconcile the scientific theory of the beginnings of the universe and life with the biblical account of creation. Rabbinical sources are cited from Nachmanides (Ramban) and Rashi along with kabbalistic interpretations of Genesis. Nathan reconciles Darwinian evolution with the biblical account and states that at deeper levels of understanding of the biblical text and of scientific theory, the two worlds overlap. \"As one studies science to deeper levels and also tries to study Bereshis [Genesis] to deeper levels, both principles begin to converge on each other.\"\n\nThe movement for intelligent design claims that an intelligent creator is responsible for the origin of life and of humankind, and rejects evolution. Jewish theologians, organizations, and activists have maintained that intelligent design is not valid science but that it is a religious concept. Although some have expressed support for a theistic interpretation of evolution, they have generally rejected the tenets of the intelligent design movement. To Rabbi Brad Hirschfield, President of the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership, intelligent design is \"their attempt to confirm what they already believe.\" Jewish organizations in the United States have been steadfast in their opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools, charging that to do so would violate the separation of church and state.\n\n\n\n"}

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 5, 1991. In the episode, Mr. Burns sells the power plant to two German investors for $100 million. The new owners immediately fire Homer, the plant's safety inspector, for his incompetence. Burns soon realizes his former workers no longer fear him and buys the plant back to regain their respect.\n\nThe episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Mark Kirkland. Originally, the writers wanted to have Burns sell the plant to the Japanese, but they decided it would have been too clichéd; the plot, however, remained the same with the Germans. The title is an inaccurate German translation of \"Burns sells the power plant\", the correct version being \"Burns verkauft das Kraftwerk\".\n\nIn its original airing on the Fox network, the episode had a 12.6 Nielsen rating, finishing the week ranked 38th.\n\n\"Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk\" received generally positive reviews from critics and was praised for several scenes, particularly the \"Land of Chocolate\" sequence in which Homer dances around in an imaginary land made entirely out of chocolate. The sequence was also remade in cutscenes from the episode in \"The Simpsons Game\".\n\nMr. Burns tells his assistant Smithers that he is considering selling the power plant to pursue other interests. Unconfirmed takeover rumors boost the plant's stock, which rises for the first time in ten years. Homer learns he owns stock in the company and sells his 100 shares for 25 cents apiece to a shady stockbroker, netting $25, which he spends on beer. He soon learns the value of the stock has risen to $52 per share. While Homer misses out on the windfall — he could have made $5,200 — other employees make small fortunes. Two German businessmen, Hans and Fritz, learn that the plant might be for sale. They offer Burns $100 million, which he immediately accepts. Burns leaves, seeking adventure, while Smithers remains an employee at the plant.\n\nThe new owners immediately begin a thorough evaluation of the plant and its employees. Homer worries his lax work ethic as safety inspector will cost him his job. When Hans and Fritz interview Homer, he is unable to intelligently answer their questions and fantasizes about frolicking in \"The Land of Chocolate\". The owners announce that Homer will be the only employee fired, so the rest of the family makes budget cuts until he can find a new job.\n\nBurns has drinks with Smithers at Moe's Tavern, where Homer has been drinking. Homer lashes out at Burns, calling him a \"greedy old reptile\" whom nobody loves. The other patrons also taunt him: Bart stamps on Burns' foot and sings \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\" while everyone except Smithers joins in. Humiliated, Burns realizes that his former employees no longer fear him. Since his ownership of the plant gave him power over ordinary men, Burns decides to buy it back.\n\nThe German investors discover that the plant is in bad need of repairs and decide to sell before they sink too much money into it. Burns, noting their desperation to sell, offers them $50 million for the plant; they reluctantly accept half what they had paid him. Now back in charge, Burns re-hires Homer, though he secretly vows revenge for the humiliation he suffered at the bar.\n\nThe episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Mark Kirkland. It features several German elements, including a reference to John F. Kennedy's \"ich bin ein Berliner\" speech. The title \"Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk\" is an inaccurate German translation of \"Burns sells the power plant\", the correct version being \"Burns verkauft das Kraftwerk\". Originally, the writers decided to have Burns sell the plant to the Japanese, but they decided that it would have been too clichéd; the plot, however, remained the same with the Germans. The writers and animators based one of the two German buyers on the German character Sergeant Schultz from the American television show \"Hogan's Heroes\". By coincidence, frequent \"Simpsons\" guest star Phil Hartman happened to know a little German so he helped out with the conversations. Hartman also guest-starred in the episode as Horst and the stockbroker. In the dubbed German version of the episode, the two Germans whom Homer meets in Moe's Tavern each speak a different dialect to distinguish them from the American characters who speak Standard German.\n\nThe writers had a tough time coming up with Bart's prank call to Moe's Tavern and Moe's reply, in which they could not include any foul language. The writer also wanted to include a longer portion of Burns's sworn vengeance, but had to trim it in the end. In this episode, the producers decided to start stressing the relationship between Smithers and Burns. Originally, there was a two-minute scene involving the two, but the writers cut it down considerably. \nThe producers also noted the constant flux of the Simpsons' economic state; one moment Homer appears to have his wallet full of cash, and the next, they do not even have a savings account. The animators also included a character other than Lenny or Homer with a beardline, something the producers did not like. Originally, when The Simpsons shorts aired on \"The Tracy Ullman Show\", all the male characters had beardlines similar to Homer's; however, after the Simpsons became their own show, they decided to drop the beardline for the majority of the characters to make Homer unique. After Homer gets fired, Bart feeds his cat a mixture of 88% ash and 12% carrots. The gag came from a real-life experience when Vitti tried to feed his cat a mixture of carrots and ash; however, the cat simply ate and regurgitated it. The sequence with the Frosty Chocolate Milkshakes in which Bart dreams what he would do with the money from the stocks is a reference to \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" shorts.\n\nIn the original script, the \"Land of Chocolate\" sequence was absent, though the dialog that set it up was present. (Homer complains to his new German bosses about the candy machines not working, to which one of them replies: \"We understand, Homer. After all, we are from the land of chocolate!\") Executive producer Sam Simon was the one who suggested that they actually do a sequence in which Homer's mind wanders off into an imaginary land made of chocolate. The sequence was storyboarded by animator Kevin O'Brien, who designed it to be a parody of \"The Sound of Music\", but supervising director David Silverman suggested it should be more original. Silverman storyboarded the revised sequence, and tried to make Homer \"deliriously happy\" as he skipped through the town. He later recalled, \"I animated that scene frame by frame, I needed to draw the skip I wanted. Homer's skipping sets the tone for that show.\"\n\nIn the sequence there was supposed to be a road sign that read \"Hershey Highway\" (Hershey's is a chocolate manufacturer) but the term also refers to anal sex. The censors objected and the writers replaced it with \"Fudgetown\". The \"Land of Chocolate\" sequence was set to a song based on music from the film \"\". Composed by Alf Clausen, the song was later included in the 1999 compilation album \"Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons\". \"The Land of Chocolate\" was also featured as a level in \"The Simpsons Game\", which was released in 2007.\n\nIn its original airing on Fox, the episode acquired a 12.6 Nielsen rating and was viewed in approximately 11.60 million homes. It finished 38th in the ratings for the week of December 2–8, 1991. It finished second in its timeslot behind \"The Cosby Show\", which came in at 11th with a 16.8 rating. \"The Simpsons\" was the highest rated show on Fox that week.\n\nSince airing, \"Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk\" has received generally positive reviews from critics. The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, praised the episode, most notably \"Homer in the land of chocolate and Smithers counselling Mr. Burns with the aid of his sock-puppet friend, Mr. Snappy the Alligator\".\n\nWriting for the \"Star Tribune\", Neal Justin rated the episode as one of his ten favorites, commenting that the scene where \"Homer dreams about prancing across a literal 'land of chocolate' [was] perhaps the most outrageous moment in \"Simpsons\" history\".\n\nIn a list of Homer's best gluttony moments, \"Herald Sun\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Mikey Cahill ranked \"The Land of Chocolate\" as number one.\n\nThe sequence was also named one of the twenty best moments in the history of the show by \"Daily Record\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Brian McIver.\n\nIn 2012, Johnny Dee of \"The Guardian\" listed the episode as one of his five favorites in the history of \"The Simpsons\", noting that it was the \"Land of Chocolate\" segment that \"makes this episode such a classic\".\n\nJon Greenberg of ESPN said the episode is one of his favorites, calling it \"hardly an average episode\". He commented that \"the sarcastic heart of the story comes at the end, when Mr. Burns realizes that wealth and time do not buy him happiness because no one, not even the scourge of Sector 7G [Homer], is scared of a powerless despot.\"\n\nThe episode was study material for a sociology course at University of California Berkeley, where it was used to \"examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show\", and to figure out what it was \"trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies.\"\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 24, 1999. In the episode, Homer becomes a food critic for a Springfield newspaper and ends up annoying the restaurant owners of Springfield after he makes negative reviews just to be mean, advice he took from fellow critics. Springfield's restaurant owners then attempt to kill Homer by feeding him a poisoned éclair. American actor Ed Asner guest starred in the episode as the newspaper editor that hires Homer.\n\nThe episode has received generally mixed reviews from television critics since airing.\n\nSpringfield Elementary arranges a trip to the offices of \"The Springfield Shopper\" for the students. Homer volunteers to drive and chaperone the children on the trip, first taking them to the zoo. They are introduced to the newspaper's history and operations. Homer smells cake and follows it to a retirement party for the newspaper's food critic. Crashing the party, Homer greedily eats the food. The editor, seeing Homer's love of food, offers him a job as the new food critic. He asks Homer to prepare a 500-word sample review first.\n\nHomer struggles with the review, but he soon gets help from Lisa, who helps him express himself. Soon Homer gets a reputation for giving out excellent reviews to every restaurant he visits. At the \"Springfield Shopper\" office, the editor introduces Homer to other critics. They chide him for being too generous in his reviews. Homer foolishly gives into their peer pressure and writes a series of bad reviews, criticizing everything. Lisa complains that he is being needlessly cruel, and she threatens to stop helping him. Homer attempts to continue reviewing by himself. Meanwhile, the local restaurateurs hold a secret meeting about Homer's negative reviews. They decide to kill him. A French chef volunteers to do the deed by feeding Homer a poisonous éclair, , at an upcoming food festival.\n\nAt the food festival, Homer goes about his reviewing duties. Bart overhears some of the restaurateurs discussing the murder plot, and he, Marge and Lisa attempt to find Homer and warn him. Meanwhile, Homer has reached the French chef's stall and is about to eat the éclair. Lisa loudly reveals the murder plot, but Homer shrugs it off. She then exclaims that the éclair is \"low fat\", and Homer throws away the lethal pastry in revulsion; when it hits Hans Moleman's gruel pot, it explodes. The police rush to the scene and arrest the Frenchman, who escapes when they get distracted. Homer and Lisa leave, but an angry mob follows them and beat up Homer.\n\n\"Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?\" was written by Al Jean and directed by Nancy Kruse as part of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\" (1999–2000). American actor Ed Asner guest starred in the episode as the newspaper editor that hires Homer. The character is based on Lou Grant, the character Asner played in the series \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" and \"Lou Grant\". The song Homer sings upon being given the food critic job is set to the tune of \"I Feel Pretty\" from the musical \"West Side Story\". The restaurant Planet Springfield is a parody of Planet Hollywood, containing items such as the film script for \"The Cable Guy\" (1996), Herbie from \"The Love Bug\" (1968), a model of the RMS \"Titanic\" from \"Titanic\" (1997), an alien similar to those from \"Mars Attacks!\" (1996), models of a TIE fighter, an X-wing fighter and C-3PO from the \"Star Wars\" saga, as well as \"the coffee mug\" from the film \"Heartbeeps\" (1981) and \"the cane\" from \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), which is not a real prop.\n\n\"Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 24, 1999. On October 7, 2008, the episode was released on DVD as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season\". Staff members Mike Scully, Al Jean, George Meyer, Dan Greaney, Matt Selman and Nancy Kruse participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set.\n\nSince airing, the episode has received generally mixed reviews from critics.\n\nIn 2003, Ryan Lane of \"The Daily Orange\" listed it as the ninth best episode of the series, noting that the \"most recent episode on the list is also perhaps the show's last classic.\"\n\nNancy Basile of About.com listed the episode as one of the episodes she felt \"shined in season eleven\".\n\nIn 2011, Keith Plocek of \"LA Weekly\"s Squid Ink blog named \"Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?\" the sixth best episode of the show with a food theme.\n\nWhile reviewing the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\", DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson however commented that \"after the solid ['Brother's Little Helper'], Season 11 dips with the more mediocre ['Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?']. Oh, the show has its moments, especially when Homer’s criticism becomes more mean-spirited. Still, the program rarely becomes anything more than okay; it’s certainly enjoyable but that’s about it.\"\n\nKarma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay analyzed \"Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?\" in their book \"The Simpsons in the Classroom\", in which they demonstrate how episodes of the series can be used in teaching. They wrote: \"Although the show's characters do not often model expository writing, we can still find ways to use \"The Simpsons\" to illustrate the importance of style. Young writers, for example, may find that their writing resembles Homer's when he attempts to write restaurant reviews in 'Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner.' Homer's diction is poor, his piece rambles off, and he attempts to make the word count by repeating 'Screw Flanders' several times. We can thus illustrate that students need to reduce wordiness [...], while developing their arguments through pertinent content or parallelism. We can also stress revision by showing what Lisa is able to do when she helps her father brainstorm. For example, when they need two more words to end the review, Lisa replaces 'Screw Flanders' with 'Bon appétit'.\"\n\n"}

He was awarded an honorary knighthood (KBE) in June 2010 for services to higher education in the United Kingdom. The award was honorary because of his American nationality, but on 31 December 2010 the knighthood was made substantive by Queen Elizabeth II following his assumption of British nationality.\n\nTrainor was educated at Calvert Hall College High School in Towson, Maryland, in the United States. He graduated from Brown University with a BA summa cum laude in American Civilization. He subsequently earned MAs from Princeton University and from Merton College, Oxford, before completing his D.Phil. in 1981 at Nuffield College, Oxford, entitled \"Authority and social structure in an industrialized area: A study of three Black Country towns, 1840–1890\". He is a former Rhodes Scholar.\n\nHe is a fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences, Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and a member of the Athenaeum Club. He is also an Honorary Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, and Trinity College of Music, and a member of the Anglo-American Fulbright Commission.\n\nTrainor is currently the President of the Economic History Society. He holds honorary degrees from the University of Kent (since 2009); the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science (since 2012); and the University of Glasgow (since 2014).\n\nHe has been Emeritus professor of Social History at King's College London since 2014, and was a member of the Arts and Humanities Research Council from 2006-11. He is an honorary fellow of the Institute of Historical Research.\n\nAs a result of his work with King's College London, the institution established a scholarship in his name, the Professor Sir Richard Trainor Postgraduate Research Scholarship, in 2014.\n\nHe is married to Marguerite Dupree, an academic historian of medicine currently at Glasgow University. They have two children.\n\nTrainor was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Greenwich (2000–2004). Prior to this appointment, he was Senior Vice-Principal of the University of Glasgow. In 2004 Trainor became Principal of King's College London, where he is also Professor of Social History. In 2009 the title of President of King's was added.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009 Rick served as President of Universities UK (UUK), the organisation that represents the heads of all UK Universities. In this role he engaged with the new Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills and latterly, the successor Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, on a wide range of issues including autonomy, funding, research, standards and immigration. He served on the Confederation of British Industries' Higher Education Task Force from 2008–2009.\n\nSince becoming Principal of King's in 2004, Trainor has overseen the promotion of the College from 96th to 19th place in the QS World University Rankings (2015/16), making it the 5th ranked UK university. \nIn 2010 King's was named UK Sunday Times University of the Year. According to 2014's Research Excellence Framework (REF), the academic institution rose 15 places since its last assessment in 2008, climbing on grade point average to reach seventh place.\n\nTrainor oversaw the College's role in the creation of King's Health Partners in 2009, an academic health science centre, in which King's College London collaborates with Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals, King's College Hospital and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trusts. He also oversaw the joining King's College London with the Francis Crick Institute in 2011.\n\nDuring Trainor's tenure, in 2009 King's acquired the East Wing of Somerset House, after 180 years of intermittent negotiations between King's and Somerset House Trust. Somerset House East Wing was opened by Her Majesty The Queen in February 2012.\n\nUnder Trainor's leadership, the College launched King's Cultural Institute, enhancing ties to a number of nearby national cultural institutions.\n\nTrainor received the Annual Leadership Award of the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education in June 2011 for his role in the College's fundraising and for alumni relations.\n\nTrainor has overseen the establishment of a number of Global Institutes – the Brazil Institute, the Russia Institute, the India Institute and the China Institute – at the College as part of greater focus on internationalisation at King's. These centres of research and study aim to focus on contemporary developments in fast-changing parts of the world.\n\nIn March 2012 Trainor was invited to join the IPPR Commission on the Future of Higher Education. In May 2012 HEFCE announced it was to undertake a Review of Philanthropic Support for Higher Education throughout the UK and Trainor sat on the review board.\n\nIn June 2013 Exeter College, Oxford announced that Trainor was the preferred candidate to succeed Frances Cairncross as rector. The College announced his formal pre-election in October 2013. Trainor took office on 1 October 2014, during the College’s 700th anniversary year. The Rector is Head of the College with oversight of all its activities. He and Exeter’s 48 Fellows constitute the Governing Body (chaired by the Rector). The Governing Body is responsible for Exeter’s staff, its student population of c.325 undergraduates and c.200 postgraduates, its finances and its buildings. A key current project is the completion – scheduled for summer 2016 – of Exeter’s Cohen Quadrangle, on Walton Street in central Oxford, the College’s largest single physical expansion in its 701-year history.\n\nTrainor is also governor of the Royal Academy of Music and the Museum of London (as of June 2014).\n\nDuring his tenure at King's College London, the institution announced a restructure of its funding. The plans had a negative reception in the press and in the educational field.\n\nThe University and College Union (UCU) and the British Medical Association (BMA) voiced their concerns about the restructuring at King's College London. The situation at King's attracted national press coverage.\n\nTrainor responded by highlighting the pressures facing UK Universities and giving an interview to The Times about the challenges of funding cuts and his belief that further higher education funding cuts would risk serious damage to the sector.\n\nFurther, the institution's decision to close the Division of Engineering in 2009, was criticised for risking charges of \"reckless academic vandalism\". However, King’s has developed a research and teaching programme in Biomedical Engineering, assisted by a grant (under the programme of Centres of Excellence in Medical Engineering) from the Wellcome Trust and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).\n\nThe university's choice of cuts was the subject of a House of Commons Early Day Motion in March 2010: \"That this House notes the proposal by the Executive of King's College London as part of its budget review process to abolish the Chair of Palaeography, the only one of its kind in the United Kingdom; further notes the fundamental importance of palaeography to a broad and interdisciplinary scholarly community; considers that without the development of palaeographic skills, millions of documents would be rendered inaccessible, thus depriving the nation of its full historical legacy; and therefore urges King's College London to consider very carefully any proposals in respect to this prestigious and important Chair.\"\n\nIn January 2012, King's announced the appointment of Dr Julia Crick as Professor of Palaeography and Manuscript Studies in the School of Arts & Humanities.\n\nAnother proposal for restructuring was announced in May 2014. There was an adverse response in the media to the proposed changes.\n\nThe University and College Union have provided a regularly-updated list of media coverage. King's College London has also provided a list of rebuttal press statements.\n\n"}

{"id": "1825842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825842", "title": "Islamic views on evolution", "text": "Islamic views on evolution\n\nIslamic views on evolution are diverse, ranging from theistic evolution to Old Earth creationism. Some Muslims around the world believe \"humans and other living things have evolved over time,\" yet some others believe they have \"always existed in present form.\" Muslim thinkers have proposed and accepted elements of the theory of evolution, some holding the belief of the supremacy of God in the process. Usaama al-Azami suggested that both narratives of creation and of evolution, as understood by modern science, may be believed by modern Muslims as addressing two different kinds of truth, the revealed and the empirical. Muneer Al-Ali argues that faith and science can be integrated and complement each other.\n\nUnlike the Bible, the story of creation in the Qur'an is not told in one chapter, but rather can be pieced together from verses all over the book.\n\nIn the surah, Sūrat al-Anbiyāʼ, the Quran states that \"the heavens and the earth were of one piece\" before being parted. God then created the landscape of the earth, placed the sky above it as a roof, and created the day and night cycles by appointing an orbit for both the sun and moon. Some modern Muslims, including Abdullah Hatem of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research, interpret the Quran's story of the creation of the world in the context of science, and believe that the scientific theory of an expanding universe is described in Sūrat adh-Dhāriyāt: Sūrat al-Aʻrāf states that the \"heavens and the earth\" were created in the equivalent of six \"yawm.\" The Arabic word \"yawm\" means \"day\", and so some Muslims believe the universe was created in six days, akin to the story of creation in the Book of Genesis. However, it is important to note that the \"days\" mentioned in Quran does not equals to the \"24 hours day period\". According to Quranic verse 70:4, one day in Quran is equal to 50,000 years on Earth. whereas another verse states that \"a day in the sight of your Lord is like 1,000 years of your reckoning\" (22:47). The word \"youm\" is thus understood, within the Qur'an, to be a long period of time -- an era or eon. Therefore, Muslims interpret the description of a \"six days\" creation as six distinct periods or eons. The length of these periods is not precisely defined, nor are the specific developments that took place during each period.\n\nAfter completing the Creation, God \"settled Himself upon the Throne\". The concept of a \"day of rest\" does not appear in the Quran, and in fact the concept that God needed rest after the creation from tiredness is explicitly denied \"And We did certainly create the heavens and earth and what is between them in six days, and there touched Us no weariness\" in Surat Qaf verse 38.\n\nThe only explicit reference to the creation of non-human life in the Quran appears in the aforementioned Sūrat al-Anbiyāʼ, in which God proclaims \"We made out of water every living thing.\" According to Muhammad Asad, \"only water has the peculiar properties necessary for the emergence and development of life.\"\n\nSunni theologian Said Nursî stated the Earth was already inhabited by intelligent species before humankind. He considered, supported by the hadiths from Ibn Abbas and Tabari, the Jinn lived here before but were almost wiped out by fire. A few interpreters of the Quran believed that even before Jinn, other creatures like Hinn lived on the earth although they failed to provide any narration from Quran or authentic Hadith to support these claims.\n\nThe characters of Âdam and his wife (in Islamic tradition called Ḥawwāh) appear in the Quran as the first man and woman. The Quran states that they were created from clay, and were brought to life by the blowing of soul by God entering their bodies. While verses in the Quran and some ahadith indicate that God created Adam first and that Eve was created from Adam, a few scholars proposed that the verses could have multiple interpretations.\n\nThe majority of Islamic scholars, including Yasir Qadhi, believe that Adam and Eve were supernaturally created through a miracle by God. Mohamed Ghlian has at times instead asserted that the pair evolved naturally from a common ancestor, but has more recently reached the opposite conclusion.\n\nIn the past year there has been increased support for the idea that humans evolved. (Islamic scholar Adnan Ibrahim is one of them).\nMany Muslims base their belief of this idea on ayaah 133 of Alannam in the quran which says: (وَرَبُّكَ الْغَنِيُّ ذُو الرَّحْمَةِ ۚ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفْ مِن بَعْدِكُم مَّا يَشَاءُ كَمَا أَنشَأَكُم مِّن ذُرِّيَّةِ قَوْمٍ آخَرِينَ) this ayah is literally translated and interpreted into: ( And your Lord is the Free of need, the possessor of mercy. If He wills, he can do away with you and give succession after you to whomever He wills, just as He produced you from the descendants of another people.)\n\nIn \"Kitab al-Hayawan\" (\"Book of the Animals\"), the 9th-century scholar al-Jāḥiẓ references several facets of natural selection, such as animal embryology, adaptation, and animal psychology. One notable observation al-Jāḥiẓ makes is that stronger rats were able to compete better for resources than small birds, a reference to the modern day theory of the \"struggle for existence.\" In the 11th century, the scholar Sami S. Hawi argues that Persian scholar Ibn Miskawayh wrote about the evolution of man in his \"Fawz al-aṣghar\".\n\nThe 14th-century influential historiographer and historian Ibn Khaldun wrote the \"Muqaddimah\" or Prolegomena (\"Introduction\") on what he referred to as the \"gradual process of creation.\" He stated that the Earth began with abiotic components such as \"minerals.\" Slowly, primitive stages of plants such as \"herbs and seedless plants\" developed and eventually \"palms and vines.\" Khaldun connects the later stages of plant development to the first stages of animal development. Finally, he claims that the greater thought capabilities of human beings was \"reached from the world of the monkeys.\"\n\nIn his 1874 book titled \"History of the Conflict between Religion and Science\", John William Draper, a scientist and contemporary of Charles Darwin, criticized the Catholic Church for its disapproval of \"the Mohammedan theory of the evolution of man from lower forms, or his gradual development to his present condition in the long lapse of time.\"\n\nIn the 19th century, a scholar of Islamic revival, Jamal-al-Din al-Afghānī agreed with Darwin that life will compete with other life in order to succeed. He also believed that there was competition in the realm of ideas similar to that of nature. However, he believed explicitly that life was created by God; Darwin did not discuss the origin of life, saying only \"Probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some primordial form, into which life was first breathed\". A contemporary of Al-Afghani, Shia scholar Hussein al-Jisr, declared that there is no contradiction between evolution and the Islamic scriptures. He stated that \"there is no evidence in the Quran to suggest whether all species, each of which exists by the grace of God, were created all at once or gradually,\" and referred to the aforementioned story of creation in Sūrat al-Anbiyā.\n\nIn Turkey, important scholars strove to accommodate the theory of evolution in Islamic scripture during the first decades of the Turkish Republic; their approach to the theory defended Islamic belief in the face of scientific theories of their times. The Saudi Arabian government, on the other hand, began funding and promoting denial of evolution in the 1970s in accordance to its Salafi-Wahhabi interpretation of Islam. This stance garnered criticism from the governments and academics of mainline Muslim countries such as Turkey Pakistan, Lebanon, and Iran, where evolution is taught and promoted.\n\nKhalid Anees, of the Islamic Society of Britain, discussed the relationship between Islam and evolution in 2004:Islam also has its own school of Evolutionary creationism/Theistic evolutionism, which holds that mainstream scientific analysis of the origin of the universe is supported by the Quran. Many Muslims believe in evolutionary creationism, especially among Sunni and Shia Muslims and the Liberal movements within Islam. Among scholars of Islam İbrahim Hakkı of Erzurum who lived in Erzurum then Ottoman Empire now Republic of Turkey in the 18th century is famous for stating that 'between plants and animals there is sponge, and, between animals and humans there is monkey'.\n\nContemporary Islamic scholars Ghulam Ahmed Pervez, Edip Yüksel, and T.O. Shanavas in his book, \"Islamic Theory of Evolution: the Missing Link between Darwin and the Origin of Species\" say that there is no contradiction between the scientific theory of evolution and Quran's numerous references to the emergence of life in the universe.\n\nWhile Muslims scholars reject Young Earth creationism, and claim the story of creation in the Book of Genesis was corrupted, a movement has begun to emerge recently in some Muslim countries promoting themes that have been characteristic of Christian creationists. This stance has received criticism, due to claims that the Quran and Bible are incompatible. Adnan Oktar, also known by his pen-name Harun Yahya, is a Muslim advocate against the theory of evolution. He is considered a charlatan by many Muslim scholars, and his representative at a conference on Islam and evolution in January 2013 was ridiculed during and after the conference. Most of Yahya's information is taken from the Institute for Creation Research and the Intelligent Design movement in the United States. Oktar largely uses the Internet to promote his ideas. His BAV (Bilim Araştırma Vakfı/ Science Research Foundation) organizes conferences with leading American creationists.\n\nAccording to the \"Guardian\" newspaper, some British Muslim students have distributed leaflets on campus, advocating against Darwin's theory of evolution. At a conference in the UK in January 2004, entitled \"Creationism: Science and Faith in Schools\", \"Dr Khalid Anees, of the Islamic Society of Britain stated that 'Muslims interpret the world through both the Koran and what is tangible and seen. There is no contradiction between what is revealed in the Koran and natural selection and survival of the fittest'.\" Maurice Bucaille, famous in the Muslim world for his commentary on the Quran and science, attempted to reconcile evolution with the Quran by accepting animal evolution up to early hominid species, and then positing a separate hominid evolution leading to modern humans. However, these ideas differ from the theory of evolution as accepted by biologists.\n\nContemporary Islamic scholar Yasir Qadhi believes that the idea that humans evolved is against the Quran, but says that God may have placed humanity perfectly into an evolutionary pattern to give the appearance of human evolution. Modern scholar Usaama al-Azami later argued that scriptural narratives of creation, and evolution as understood by modern science, may be believed by modern Muslims as addressing two different kinds of truth, the revealed and the empirical. The late Ottoman intellectual Ismail Fennî, while personally rejecting Darwinism, insisted that it should be taught in schools as even false theories contributed to the improvement of science. He held that interpretations of the Quran might require amendment should Darwinism eventually be shown to be true.\nAnother scholar, Muneer Al-Ali, argues that faith and science can be integrated and complement each other in explaining the complexity and mysteries of existence.\n\nA research paper published in 2016 by the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research wrote that there is not a consensus among scholars on how to respond to the theory of evolution, and it is not clear whether the scholars are even qualified to give a response.\n\nAs per a 2008 report, Evolutionary biology was included in the high-school curricula of most Muslim countries. Science foundations of 14 Muslim countries, including Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, and Egypt, recently signed a statement by the Interacademy Panel (IAP, a global network of science academies), in support of the teaching of evolution, including human evolution.\n\nA 2009 survey conducted by the McGill researchers and their international collaborators found that 85% of Indonesian high school students and 86% of Pakistani high school students agreed with the statement, \"Millions of fossils show that life has existed for billions of years and changed over time.\"\n\nAccording to a more recent Pew study these numbers appear to increase slowly but steadily. For instance, a relatively large fraction of people accept human evolution in Kazakhstan (79%) and Lebanon (78%), but relatively few in Afghanistan (26%) and Iraq (27%), with most of the other Islamic countries somewhere in between.\n\nIn 2014, when the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant captured the Iraqi city of Mosul, the group issued a new set of rules for the schools there, which included a ban on the teaching of evolution.\n\nRana Dajani, a university professor who teaches evolution in Jordan, wrote that almost all of her students are hostile to the idea of evolution, at the beginning of the class, but by the end of the class, the majority accept the idea.\n\nIn 2017, Turkey announced plans to end the teaching evolution before the university level, with education Alpaslan Durmuş claiming it is too complicated and \"controversial\" a topic to be understood by young minds.\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Movement's view of evolution is that of universal acceptance, albeit divinely designed. The movement actively promotes god-directed \"evolution\". Over the course of several decades the movement issued various publications in support of the scientific concepts behind evolution.\n\n\n"}

He was the founder of the oldest line, which survives to this day.\n\nWilliam was born in Kassel, the eldest son of Landgrave Philip the Magnanimous and Christine of Saxony. After his father's death in 1567, the Landgraviate of Hesse was divided between the four sons out of the late Landgrave of Hesse's first marriage, and William received the portion around the capital Kassel, the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel.\n\nWilliam took a leading part in safeguarding the Lutheran Reformation, and was indefatigable in his endeavours to unite the different sections of Protestantism against Catholicism. However, he was reluctant to use military force in this conflict.\n\nAs an administrator he displayed rare energy, issuing numerous ordinances, appointing expert officials, and in particular ordering his slender finances. By a law of primogeniture he secured his Landgraviate's land against such testamentary divisions as had diminished his father's estate.\n\nWilliam is most notable for his patronage of the arts and sciences. As a youth he had cultivated close connections with scholars and as a ruler he kept up this connection. His interest in astronomy may have been inspired by Petrus Apianus's \"Astronomicum Caesareum\".\n\nWilliam was a pioneer in astronomical research, and perhaps owes his most lasting fame to his discoveries in this branch of study. Most of the mechanical contrivances which made instruments of Tycho Brahe so superior to those of his contemporaries were adopted in Kassel about 1584. From then on the observations made in Hesse-Kassel seem to have been about as accurate as those of Tycho. However the resulting longitudes were 6' too great in consequence of the adopted solar parallax of 3'.\n\nThe principal product of the astronomical observations was the Hessian star catalogue, a catalogue of about a thousand stars. The locations were determined by the methods usually employed in the 16th century, connecting a fundamental star by means of Venus with the sun, and thus finding its longitude and latitude, while other stars could at any time be referred to the fundamental star. It should be noticed that clocks, on which Tycho depended very little, were used at Kassel for finding the difference of right ascension between Venus and the sun before sunset. Tycho preferred observing the angular distance between the sun and Venus when the latter was visible in the daytime.\n\nThe Hessian star catalogue was published in \"Historia coelestis\" (Augsburg, 1666) by Albert Curtz, and a number of other observations are to be found in \"Coeli et siderum in eo errantium observationes Hassiacae\" (Leiden, 1618), edited by Willebrord Snell.\n\nR. Wolf, in his \"Astronomische Mittheilungen,\" No. 45 (Vierteljahrsschrift der naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Zurich, 1878), has given a resume of the manuscripts still preserved at Kassel, which throw much light on the methods adopted in the observations and reductions.\n\nWilliam was married to Sabine of Württemberg, daughter of Christoph, Duke of Württemberg.\nThey had the following children:\n\nIn addition William had a few illegitimate children. Most significant and favored among these was Philipp von Cornberg (1553–1616), William's son by Elisabeth Wallenstein. Philipp was ennobled by his father and became the ancestor of the current Barons von Cornberg.\n\n<BR>\n"}

Smith, niece of Commodore Gillis; commissioned 3 September 1919, Lieutenant Commander Webb Trammell in command.\n\n\"Gillis\" sailed from Newport, Rhode Island, 17 December 1919 and moored at San Diego, California 20 January 1920. She joined the Pacific Fleet Destroyer Force in tactics and maneuvers along the West Coast until decommissioned at San Diego 26 May 1922. \n\nRecommissioned in ordinary 28 June 1940, she was reclassified 2 August as seaplane tender destroyer AVD-12. Following conversion she was placed in full commission at San Francisco, California, 25 March 1941.\n\n\"Gillis\" was assigned as tender to Patrol Wing 4, Aircraft Scouting Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet. In the following months she performed plane guard patrol between San Diego and Seattle, Washington with time out for aircraft tending duties at Sitka, Alaska (14–17 June) ; Dutch Harbor and Kodiak (15–31 July). After overhaul in the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard she returned to Kodiak 16 October 1941 to resume tending of amphibious patrol planes in Alaskan waters. She was serving at Kodiak when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and returned to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard 9 February 1942 for overhaul.\n\n\"Gillis\" resumed tender duties at Kodiak 26 May 1942. She was stationed at Atka (11–13 June) tending amphibious patrol aircraft bombing the Japanese on Kiska Island. On air-sea rescue patrol 6 June 1942, she made three depth charge runs on an underwater sound contact. A Japanese submarine violently broached the surface revealing its conning tower and propeller, then disappeared. \"Gillis\" was unable to regain contact. She was credited with damaging this underseas raider in the combat area off Umak Island. She was attacked by three Japanese patrol bombers while at Adak 20 July. One bomb, a dud, splashed within 10 feet alongside. Other bombs rained about her, ahead and astern. She was drenched by water thrown up by the explosions but escaped damage or casualties.\n\n\"Gillis\" continued her varied duties as aircraft tender and air-sea rescue patrol ship throughout the Aleutian Campaign. Brief intervals of repair were accomplished in the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. She terminated this service 19 April 1944 when she departed Dutch Harbor for overhaul in the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. She arrived at San Diego 13 June and spent the following months as plane guard for aircraft carriers training along the California coast. She was then routed on to Pearl Harbor, arriving 8 December 1944. She operated in Hawaiian waters as plane guard for escort carrier \"Makassar Strait\" (CVE-91) until 20 February 1945. She then sailed with Rear Admiral Morton L. Deyo's Gunfire and Covering Force, en route via the Marshalls, Marianas and Ulithi for the invasion of Okinawa.\n\n\"Gillis\" arrived off Kerama Retto 25 March 1945. She guarded minesweepers to the west, then stood by underwater demolition teams clearing approaches to the western beaches of Okinawa.

{"id": "1825859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825859", "title": "The Mavis Bramston Show", "text": "The Mavis Bramston Show\n\nThe Mavis Bramston Show was a weekly Australian television satirical sketch comedy revue series which aired on the Seven Network from 1964 to 1968. Inspired by the British TV satirical revue TV shows of the period (notably \"That Was The Week That Was\"), \"Mavis Bramston\" was the first successful venture in this genre on Australian TV. At its peak it was one of the most popular Australian TV programs of its era and it propelled many of the 'classic' cast to national stardom in Australia, including June Salter, Barry Creyton, Noeline Brown, Gordon Chater, Ron Frazer and Carol Raye, who devised the series.\n\nThe impact of \"The Mavis Bramston Show\" in Australia in the mid-1960s was heightened because of its unique place in the history of the Australian television industry. After its inception in 1956, Australian television broadcasting had rapidly become dominated by the socio-economic influence of the United States and (to a lesser extent) of the United Kingdom. By the early 1960s at least 80% of Australian TV programming was sourced from the US and American TV series were consistently the top-rating shows. In 1963 the Vincent Report on the Australian media found that 97% of drama broadcast on Australian TV between 1956 and 1963 was American-made. The few programmes that were made in Australia were usually low-cost copies of proven American talk-variety or quiz show formats.\n\nBecause of the absence of government-mandated local content regulations, Australian TV producers faced enormous challenges in trying to compete against imported American and British programs, which benefited from high budgets, an international talent pool and huge economies of scale, thanks to their large domestic audiences and established worldwide distribution networks. These advantages were further enhanced by the fact that American producers and networks offered Australian channels attractive discount rates on bundled programming.\n\nDespite the overwhelming dominance of imported programming, local production gradually increased in the mid-1960s for several reasons—the licensing of a third network in major cities (which ultimately became the TEN Network), the introduction of videotape technology (which permitted pre-recording and editing, and reduced production costs) and the enforcement of local production quotas on TV advertising, which helped to foster a local skill-base.\n\nPremièring only months after Crawford Productions' landmark police drama \"Homicide\", \"Mavis Bramston\" demonstrated both that it was possible to make satirical TV comedy in Australia, featuring Australian issues and characters, and that there was a significant audience for such a show. As the first Australian-produced TV comedy series to become a national success with both critics and viewers, \"Mavis\" is therefore considered a milestone in the development of Australian TV. Many at the time expected that this honour would go to Graham Kennedy's \"In Melbourne Tonight\", which was hugely popular in its home city, but it did not become a fully-fledged national hit until 1969. Writer Hugh Stuckey opined that this was in part because IMT faced strong competition from the shows it followed, the top-rating American variety series \"The Perry Como Show\" and \"The Andy Williams Show\".\n\n\"Mavis Bramston\" grew out of the recent local theatrical tradition of topical satirical revue —- most notably the popular revues staged at Sydney's Phillip Street Theatre in the 1950s and 1960s -— but it was also strongly influenced by the British satire boom and especially by the contemporary British TV satirical comedy series \"That Was The Week That Was\" and \"Not Only... But Also\".\n\nThe \"Mavis\" cast, which changed considerably over its three-year run, initially featured many imported or expatriate British performers (Carol Raye, Gordon Chater, Miriam Karlin, Ronnie Stevens, Hazel Phillips) alongside experienced Australian TV actors such as John Bluthal (who was becoming well known in Britain) and Australian performers such as June Salter, Barry Creyton, Ron Frazer, Barbara Angell, Bryan Davies, Noeline Brown and Reg Livermore, who were relative newcomers to TV but who between them had decades of experience in music, theatre, cabaret and revue.\n\nThe original co-stars of the show were:\n\n\nDuring its three-year run, other regular cast members and guests included June Salter (1964 pilot, 1965–1967), Miriam Karlin (1965), John Bluthal (1965), Ron Frazer (1965–1968), Hazel Phillips (1965–68), Ronnie Stevens (1965–66), Neva Carr Glyn (1966), June Thody (1966), Barbara Angell (1966–1968, also a scriptwriter), Andonia Katsaros (1966–1968), Peter Reeves (1967), Bryan Davies (1964), Dawn Lake (1967), Johnny Lockwood (1967–1968) and Reg Livermore (1968). Barbara Wyndon and Al Thomas guest starred in some episodes. Among the crew was a young production assistant, Peter Weir, who went on to become one of Australia's best-known and most successful film directors.\n\nThere are several versions of the source of the ironic joke behind the show's title. The most frequently quoted account is that it derived from an Australian theatrical expression. The nickname \"Mavis Bramstons\" mocked a phenomenon common at that time on the Australian stage. In the years after World War II, overseas actors (many of whom who were considered second-rate or well past their best) were often imported to star in local productions, even though there were local performers available who were as good or better than their overseas counterparts. One of the most famous examples of this trend was the \"discovery\" of actress and singer Jill Perryman; while understudying the much-loved Evie Hayes for the lead role in a 1953 production of the musical \"Call Me Madam\", Perryman was able to make her critical breakthrough after Evie Hayes was sidelined by illness. Hayes and Perryman became great friends. Hayes later appeared as Perryman's mother in \"Funny Girl\".\n\nThe stock persona of an imported second-rate actress became the central conceit of the series. The opening scene of each episode showed \"Mavis\", now brought to life as a parodic character, arriving at Sydney airport to be greeted by the waiting press; the irony was that although the show was called \"The Mavis Bramston Show\", this was the only scene in which she appeared. Noeline Brown (1964–1966) played the eponymous Mavis in the pilot and the first five shows. She was succeeded by Maggie Dence, who became the \"face\" of the series; she regularly featured in press articles and on magazine covers and was widely employed by the show's sponsor, Ampol, making well-attended promotional appearances all over the country.\n\nThe show's creator and original co-star, Carol Raye, had enjoyed considerable success in the UK as an actor, singer and dancer, followed by a stint working for the national TV service in Kenya (where her husband worked for the Colonial Veterinary Service). In 1964 the couple had decided to emigrate to Australia, arriving in March of that year. Raye had asked friends in Britain for contacts in the Australian TV industry and this led to a meeting with (Sir) Charles Moses, then the General Manager of the ABC. He suggested that she should try her luck with Sydney commercial station ATN-7 and gave her a letter of introduction to Seven's general manager, James Oswin. That meeting was successful and Raye became one of the first female TV executives in Australia—she was appointed as Oswin's assistant in \"Matters of Live Programming\" and was given an office and a brief to watch local television and come up with ideas for new programs.\n\nInspired by the BBC's \"That Was The Week That Was\", Raye suggested a show based on TW3's format of topical satire, and although initially skeptical, Oswin agreed and allocated a budget of AU£1500 for pilot episode. Raye then set about recruiting performers to fill the roles of TW3's stars Millicent Martin, Bernard Levin and David Frost. By chance, she had also been given an introduction to Gordon Chater, who immediately accepted her offer on the expectation that the new show would be a TV version of the famous Phillip St Revues, in which he had been starring.\n\nDuring this period, Raye was also drafted in to help develop a show to be sponsored by the Bradmill textile company, and she was taken to The Music Hall at Neutral Bay, a popular theatre-restaurant presenting Victorian-style comedy-melodramas that featured considerable audience interaction. The show Raye saw that evening, \"The Evil That Men Do\", co-starred the Music Hall's resident Villain and Villainess, Barry Creyton and Noeline Brown. Raye was impressed with Creyton's looks, his urbane style and his skills in handling the often rowdy Music Hall audiences, and immediately knew she had found her second co-star. Soon after this, Noeline Brown met the show's co-producer, Michael Plant at a party and he offered her the part of Mavis in the pilot episode.\n\nTo develop the script, Raye hired a team of writers including James Fishburn (who also acted as Executive Producer), John Mackellar, David Sale (who went on to write for the hugely popular 1970s soap opera \"Number 96\"), actor-writer Jon Finlayson (who had written a successful intimate revue in Melbourne with Barbara Angell), Melvyn Morrow (a writer of revues and later Director of Drama at Stonyhurst College and writer of \"A Song to Sing, O\") and Ken Shadie, who had begun writing comedy sketches while working in Seven's engineering department; he also later wrote for \"Number 96\" and co-wrote the script of the hit Paul Hogan film \"Crocodile Dundee\".\n\nAt this stage Raye was intending to work only as the show's producer, and she still needed to find a female lead; Chater suggested June Salter (who agreed to a guest appearance in the pilot) and they also approached Judi Farr and several other actresses, but all were tied up with other work and could not commit to the lead role. Chater finally suggested that Raye should do the pilot herself, for fear that Seven would lose interest in the show and cancel, and although she was not keen to perform and co-produce, Raye agreed to do it.\n\nThe production team needed to find a proper name for the new show (its working title was \"The Late Show\") and, as noted above, the final choice was inspired by their desire to satirise the cultural cringe that prevailed in Australian theatre.\n\nThe name \"Mavis Bramston\" was suggested by Jon Finlayson, who cited an old Melbourne theatre tradition in which \"an actress who's really daggy or over the top, or up herself\" was nicknamed a \"Mavis Bramston\". With this in mind, they came up with the idea of having a purported actress from England who is ostensibly brought in to star in the show, but in fact makes only a brief appearance.\n\nDuring rehearsals it was decided that the show would open with Barry Creyton's song \"Togetherness\", which he had originally written for a Phillip St revue called \"At It Again\"; there were also topical songs with lyrics by David Sale and music by Seven's resident musical director Tommy Tycho. It was filmed at the Macquarie Theatrette in Pitt Street, Sydney with Raye, Chater, Creyton, Brown and a guest appearance by June Salter.\n\nThe show opened with a heavily made-up Noeline Brown (as Mavis) in a mock interview with Jon Finlayson after which she performed a (deliberately awful) song-and-dance routine. The sketches included topical items about then Prime Minister Robert Menzies and the \"Voyager\" disaster; \"Oz\" co-editor Richard Walsh provided an \"Oz News\" segment; Gordon Chater performed his popular slapstick routine, in which he performed a comic monologue while covering himself with food then squirting the resulting mess off with a soda siphon; there was also a serious interlude with a reading of a poem written by Kath Walker, later known as Oodgeroo Noonuccal. The show concluded with the cast singing \"Friends and Neighbours\" off-camera, while footage of mob violence, war scenes and Ku Klux Klan rallies was played on screen.\n\nThe appearance of Richard Walsh is notable because it established an explicit link between \"Mavis\" and the Sydney satirical magazine \"Oz\", which at that time was the subject of a highly publicized censorship controversy. The three \"Oz\" co-editors—Walsh, Richard Neville and Martin Sharp – had recently been charged with producing an obscene publication, relating to satirical articles and photographs published in the magazine's early editions. In September 1964 the trio was found guilty of the obscenity charges, and there was a major public outcry when presiding magistrate Gerald Locke SM sentenced Walsh and Neville to six months' imprisonment with hard labour. When \"Mavis\" premiered the \"Oz Three\" were preparing their appeal against the verdict (which was ultimately quashed).\n\nThe Oz-Mavis connection was reinforced on 15 November, four days after the pilot aired, when the \"Mavis\" stars appeared at the Sydney University Theatre as part of a benefit to raise money for the \"Oz\" defence appeal. They performed a parody song entitled \"Poof The Tragic Queen\", which sent up the folk-song staple \"Puff, the Magic Dragon\". The benefit also featured radical Sydney proto-punk band The Missing Links and \"Homicide\" star Leonard Teale, who recited a \"surfie\" parody of Banjo Paterson's \"Clancy of the Overflow\".\n\nThe \"Mavis\" pilot was broadcast on ATN-7 (in Sydney only) on 11 November 1964 and it was an immediate success, with the Sydney \"Sun\" newspaper praising it as \"... a fresh new show\" that brought \"authentic, biting, saucy, swinging satire to ATN\". The film recording of the pilot episode survived and is now preserved in the collection of the National Film & Sound Archive in Canberra.\n\nSeven soon announced that they were commissioning a series. It was evident that the chemistry between the three stars was a crucial factor in its success, so Seven insisted that Raye should continue as co-star, whereas she had hoped to find a permanent female lead to replace her, so she could concentrate on production; as a compromise, Seven agreed to ease her workload by appointing Michael Plant as co-producer.\n\nFive more episodes were made during late 1964, but these were screened in Sydney and Canberra only; the Collection database of Australia's National Film and Sound Archive suggests that only three of these first six episodes have survived.\n\nNoeline Brown made a brief weekly appearance as Mavis in these first shows, but she soon tired of the one-joke role and was reluctant to take on the promotional duties required. Seven wanted her to retain her, but Brown intended to go to England and since Seven had neglected to sign her to a contract, she left the show, to be replaced by actress Maggie Dence, although she returned to the series after her visit to the UK.\n\n\"Mavis\" was an immediate success in New South Wales and this was replicated when it was broadcast nationally from early 1965. It created a media sensation and at its peak it became the highest-rating Australian TV series ever made up to that time, pulling in unprecedented 59% of the viewing audience. Capping its ratings success, the series won the 1965 Logie Award for \"Best New Show\".\n\nThe popularity of \"The Mavis Bramston Show\" quickly became the stuff of legend – it is said that Qantas pilots tried to re-arrange their schedules to be home on Wednesdays for the weekly broadcast, and in the national capital Canberra local businesses reputedly contacted Seven, asking them to reschedule the show, because it clashed with late-night shopping and revenues were falling as a result of its popularity. Around 45 episodes were produced during 1965; fortunately the majority have survived and these are now archived in the NFSA collection.\n\n\"Mavis\" almost immediately attracted controversy, but this only served to heighten its notoriety. Some local stations censored 'blasphemous' words and the term \"kin oath\" (a contraction of the Australian expletive \"fuckin' oath\") and in March 1965 Sydney Catholic clergyman Bishop Thomas Muldoon publicly announced that he intended to sell his shares in Ampol because it sponsored such an 'immoral' show. When one of the stars was quizzed by the press about the furore, they expressed surprise that a bishop would own shares, but this immediately generated more banner headlines declaring \"Actor insults Bishop\". According to Noeline Brown it was Barry Creyton who made the remark but another source quotes Gordon Chater as saying that he made the comment.\n\nWhen the show went national Carol Raye quickly found that juggling performance and production with the demands of raising a young family were becoming too much, so Seven agreed to recruit a co-producer; on Gordon Chater's suggestion they hired Michael Plant, who had started out writing scripts for radio star Grace Gibson before moving to Los Angeles, where he worked in film and TV. He was also an experienced journalist, which assisted with the topical nature of the show's humour.\n\nDespite the addition of a co-producer, Raye was soon exhausted by the frantic pace and she left the series midway through 1965. At this stage Seven still felt it necessary to import talent from the UK, and her place was taken by British TV star Miriam Karlin, who was well known for her role as the gravel-voiced, chain-smoking shop steward in the popular BBC sitcom \"The Rag Trade\". In 1966, when Chater departed, Seven brought in British actor-comedian Ronnie Stevens.\n\nAlthough the show continued to top the ratings, it was dealt another unexpected blow in late 1965 with the sudden death of Michael Plant (from an accidental overdose of sleeping tablets). He was replaced by Peter Myers, who had previously worked as a writer of intimate revues in London.\n\nDuring 1965–66 the focus of the sketches gradually shifted from topical political humour to broader social satire and more conventional revue-style material. Popular sketches included Chater's famous \"Pie Eater\" routine, in which he played a stereotypical Ocker character in a singlet and handkerchief hat, who crams pies into his mouth while extolling the virtues of the \"June Dilly-Potkins School of Charm\" (a joke on the real-life deportment schools founded by former model June Dally-Watkins). Another recurring sketch was devised by and featured Miriam Karlin who, with Gordon Chater, played an elderly couple who sit on a park bench and talk to each other without communicating.\n\nDuring 1965 the cast of local performers expanded, with regular appearances by James Kenney, June Salter and Hazel Phillips. Phillips, like Raye, had started out as a juvenile performer in her native Britain and got her break on Australian TV as one of the panelists on the popular 1960s talk show \"Beauty and the Beast\", hosted by Eric Baume. Interviewed in 2007, she recalled her stint on the Bramston show:\n\nAt the end of the year Gordon Chater announced that he was leaving the series. To replace him, the cast was augmented by imported British actor Ronnie Stevens and Australian actor-comedian Ron Frazer, who soon became a national star himself. Chater was subsequently recruited for a new comedy series, \"My Name's McGooley, What's Yours?\" which premiered in February 1967 and quickly became the most popular and successful Australian sitcom of the era.\n\nDespite the changes, the popularity of \"Mavis\" remained high through 1966 and it won three Logie awards that year – \"Best Live Show\", \"Best Female Personality\" (Carol Raye) and the Gold Logie for \"Most Popular Personality on Australian Television\" (Chater). Hugh Taylor succeeded Ron Way as director and the regular cast now comprised Creyton, Frazer, June Thody, Neva Carr Glyn and Noeline Brown (recently returned from her stint in the UK), with guest appearances by Stuart Wagstaff, Arlene Dorgan, scriptwriter Barbara Angell, Bryan Davies, Johnny Lockwood (who later starred in \"Number 96\") and Penny Ramsey.\n\nLike Chater before him, \"Mavis\" made Ron Frazer a national TV star. One of his most popular roles was as a stereotypical Australian working-class character called \"Ocker\", and Frazer is now credited with popularising the term. He was also well known for his 'camp' character, whose regular catchphrase \"my second-best friend\" also gained wide currency at the time.\n\n\"Mavis\" continued to generate controversy into 1966. On 12 February \"The Age\" reported that the Broadcasting Control Board was to investigate a sketch on that week's show which sent up the recent retirement announcement by Prime Minister Robert Menzies. The sketch featured members of the cast asking questions that \"put a humorous and false slant\" on answers Menzies gave to reporters' questions at his farewell press conference. The \"Age\" item concluded with a comment from HSV-7's manager, Mr K. Cairns, who maintained that the sketch \"in no way held Sir Robert up to ridicule\", and stated that he had seen it himself and found it \"extremely funny\".\n\nBarry Creyton left the series at the end of 1966 and went on to host his own short-lived variety series, \"The Barry Creyton Show\", in Melbourne. In later years he worked extensively in theatre and revue.\n\nThere is very little extant information about the 1967 series and, as noted below, it is believed that most if not all the tapes of these shows are now lost.\n\nBy 1968, with all the original stars gone, ratings were declining. It was at this point, after 18 months of writing for the show and making occasional guest appearances, that Barbara Angell was finally given a major role, jointly headlining the show with Ron Frazer. She threw herself into the task, reading every newspaper every day, with the plan of writing at least one topical song and two sketches every week and according to her, they managed to reverse the ratings slide:\n\nAngell also featured in one of the last events in the career of British comedian Tony Hancock. Hancock's career had declined since his ill-advised 1961 split with longtime writing team Ray Galton and Alan Simpson (a move Hancock himself had later described as \"professional suicide\"). He was becoming increasingly affected by drugs and alcohol, as evidenced by his shambolic stage appearances in Melbourne in October 1967; at the time of his Australian visit he was in the process of divorcing his second wife.\n\nNevertheless, he was still a major star, and in March 1968 Seven brought him to Australia to star in a locally made series, \"Hancock Down Under\". To help publicise the project, the station arranged for him to make a guest appearance on \"Mavis\" and Angell was chosen to appear with him because, she later recalled, \"they had wanted someone who was not easily throwable, because he was terribly easily throwable and very unsure of himself\".\n\nOn the day of the taping, Angell spent the morning at his hotel going through the sketch with Hancock, trying to reassure and relax him, then she left for the studio. Hancock arrived at the studio during rehearsals, but when it came time for his final camera rehearsal, he had disappeared and he remained missing for four days; in the event he had to be hastily replaced by actor Johnny Lockwood. Several months after his aborted \"Mavis\" appearance, Hancock took his own life in his Sydney apartment.\n\n\"The Mavis Bramston Show\" was cancelled during 1968 and replaced by a short-lived variety revue show called \"Anything Goes\".\n\nIn 1971 Seven produced a one-hour reunion special, \"Mavis's Back\", which brought together many of the original cast including Chater, Frazer, Salter and Lockwood\n\nThe show and its cast won the following Logie Awards:\n\n1965\n\n1966\n\nUnlike many contemporary Australian TV shows, a significant portion of \"The Mavis Bramston Show\" has survived to the present. The collection database of the National Film and Sound Archive in Canberra indicates that the Archive holds copies of most of the episodes made between 1964 and 1966. However the database shows no copies of any program from the 1967 series, which are presumably now lost and only compilations of highlights from the 1968 series, suggesting that the full original program tapes from that series are also lost.\n\nThese losses might be explained by contemporary changes in Australian broadcasting and production practices. The 1964–66 episodes of \"Mavis\" were evidently broadcast live and most survive on 16mm film, since it was the practice in the early 1960s for the major commercial channels in Sydney and Melbourne to record telecine film transfers of these shows for distribution to regional and interstate TV stations. By 1967, however, most independent producers and Australian TV stations were using videotape but (as in the UK and the USA) a high proportion of videotaped Australian programming from the 1960s and 1970s was subsequently erased or otherwise disposed of.\n\n\n\n\nYouTube:\n"}

He later coached the Brown University soccer team from 1946 to 1959.\n\nKennaway began his senior soccer career with amateur Montreal club Montreal CPR, the team of the Canadian Pacific Railway. In January 1927 he signed with Providence F.C. of the first professional American Soccer League. In 1928, the club was renamed the Providence Gold Bugs. In 1931, new ownership moved the team to Fall River, Massachusetts and renamed the team Fall River. In the summer of 1931, the team again changed ownership, becoming the New Bedford Whalers. Kennaway remained with the team through all these changes.\n\nAn excellent performance in a friendly game for Fall River against a touring Celtic team in 1931 gained the attention of the Scottish side. When their regular goalkeeper John Thomson died during a match later that year, Kennaway was signed by Celtic. Kennaway played from 1931 to 1939 in the Scottish Football League for Celtic. During his stint Celtic won the league championship twice and the Scottish Cup twice (1933 and 1937). He made 295 total appearances for the \"Bhoys\" and recorded 83 clean sheets.\n\nKennaway was a dual internationalist. He played once for Canada, against the United States in Brooklyn in 1926 on 6 November.\n\nAfter joining Celtic, he played for Scotland against Austria at Hampden Park in 1933. He would have played more times for Scotland, but the other Home Nations objected to a Canadian playing in goal for Scotland. Kennaway also represented the Scottish League XI four times.\n\nSome reports also state that Kennaway played for the United States, but there is no evidence of this. He did become a US citizen in 1948.\n\nKennaway returned to his native Canada upon the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. His wife being from Providence, the couple settled there after the War.

Development began in November 1992, with programmers John Carmack and John Romero, artists Adrian Carmack and Kevin Cloud, and designer Tom Hall. Late in development, Hall was replaced by Sandy Petersen and programmer Dave Taylor joined. The music and sound effects were created by Bobby Prince.\n\nThe \"Doom\" concept was proposed in late 1992, after the release of \"Wolfenstein 3D\" and its sequel \"Spear of Destiny\". John Carmack was working on an improved 3D game engine from those games, and the team wanted to have their next game take advantage of his designs. Several ideas were proposed, including a new game in their \"Commander Keen\" series, but John proposed a game about using technology to fight demons inspired by the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" campaigns the team played. The initial months of development were spent building prototypes, while Hall created the \"Doom Bible\", a design document for his vision of the game and its story; after id released a grandiose press release touting features that the team had not yet begun working on, the \"Doom Bible\" was rejected in favor of a plotless game with no design document at all.\n\nOver the next six months, Hall designed levels based on real military bases, Romero built features, and artists Adrian and Cloud created textures and demons based on clay models they built. Hall's level designs, however, were deemed uninteresting and Romero began designing his own levels; Hall, increasingly frustrated with his limited influence, was fired in July. He was replaced by Petersen in September, and the team worked increasingly long hours until the game was completed in December 1993. \"Doom\" was self-published by id on December 10, 1993, and immediately downloaded by thousands of players.\n\nIn May 1992, id Software released \"Wolfenstein 3D.\" It is often referred to as being the \"grandfather of 3D shooters\", specifically first-person shooters, because it established the fast-paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in the genre and greatly increased the genre's popularity. Immediately following its release, most of the team began work on a set of new \"Wolfenstein\" episodes, \"Spear of Destiny\". As the episodes used the same game engine as the original game, id co-founder and lead programmer John Carmack instead focused on technology research for the company's next game, just as he had experimented with creating a 3D game engine prior to the development of \"Wolfenstein 3D\". Between May and \"Spear of Destiny\"s release in September 1992, he created several experimental engines, including one for a racing game, before working on an enhanced version of the \"Wolfenstein\" engine to be licensed to Raven Software for their game \"ShadowCaster\". For this engine, he developed several enhancements to the \"Wolfenstein\" engine, including sloped floors, textures on the floors and ceilings in addition to the walls, and fading visibility over a distance. The resulting engine was much slower than the \"Wolfenstein\" one, but was deemed acceptable for an adventure game like \"ShadowCaster\".\n\nFollowing the release of \"Spear of Destiny\" and the completion of the \"ShadowCaster\" engine, id Software discussed what their next title would be. They wanted to create another 3D game using Carmack's new engine as a starting point, but were largely tired of \"Wolfenstein\". Lead designer Tom Hall was especially weary of it, and pushed for the team to make another game in the \"Commander Keen\" series; the team had created seven episodes in the series in 1990–91 as their first games, but the planned third set of episodes had been dropped in favor of \"Wolfenstein 3D\". While Carmack was initially interested in the idea, the rest of the team was not. They collectively felt that the platforming gameplay of the series was a poor fit for Carmack's fast-paced 3D engines, and especially after the success of \"Wolfenstein\" were interested in pursuing more games of that type. Additionally, the other two co-founders of id were not interested in creating another \"Keen\" game: John Romero, the designer of \"Wolfenstein\", was not interested in doing another \"cutesy\" game, and lead artist Adrian Carmack preferred to create art in a darker style than the \"Keen\" games. John Carmack soon lost interest in \"Keen\" idea as well, instead coming up with his own concept: a game about using technology to fight demons, inspired by the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" campaigns the team played, combining the styles of \"Evil Dead II\" and \"Aliens\". The concept originally had a working title of \"Green and Pissed\", which was also the name of a concept Hall had proposed prior to \"Wolfenstein\", but Carmack soon named the proposed game after a line in the film \"The Color of Money\": \"'What's in the case?' / 'In here? Doom.'\"\n\nThe team agreed to pursue the \"Doom\" concept, and development began in November 1992. The initial development team was composed of five people: programmers John Carmack and John Romero, artists Adrian Carmack and Kevin Cloud, and designer Tom Hall. They moved offices to a dark office building, which they named \"Suite 666\", and drew inspiration from the noises coming from the dentist's office next door. They also cut ties with Apogee Software, who had given them the initial advance money for creating their first game, \"Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons\", and through which they had published the shareware versions of their games to date. While they had a good personal relationship with owner Scott Miller, they felt that they were outgrowing the publisher. Cloud, who was involved in id's business dealings, pushed for id to take over shareware publishing duties themselves after investigating and finding that Apogee was unable to reliably handle the volume of customers buying id's games through Apogee. He convinced the others that the increased sales revenue would make up for the problems of handling their own publishing. The two companies parted amicably, and \"Doom\" was set to be self-published.\n\nEarly in development, rifts in the team began to appear. Hall, who despite having wanted to develop a different game remained the lead designer and creative director for the company, did not want \"Doom\" to have the same lack of plot as \"Wolfenstein 3D\". At the end of November he delivered a design document, which he named the \"Doom Bible\", that described the plot, backstory, and design goals for the project. His design was a science fiction horror concept wherein scientists on the Moon open a portal from which aliens emerge. Over a series of levels the player discovers that the aliens are demons; Hell also steadily infects the level design as the atmosphere becomes darker and more terrifying. While Romero initially liked the idea, John Carmack not only disliked it but dismissed the idea of having a story at all: \"Story in a game is like story in a porn movie; it's expected to be there, but it's not that important.\" Rather than a deep story, John Carmack wanted to focus on the technological innovations, dropping the levels and episodes of \"Wolfenstein\" in favor of a fast, continuous world. Tom disliked the idea, but Romero sided with Carmack. Although John Carmack was the lead programmer rather than a designer, he was becoming seen in the company as the most important source of ideas; the company considered taking out key person insurance on Carmack but no one else.\n\nHall spent the next few weeks reworking the \"Doom Bible\" to work with Carmack's technological ideas, while the rest of the team planned how they could implement them. His adjusted vision for the plot had the player character assigned to a large military base on an alien planet, Tei Tenga. At the start of the game, as the first of four player character soldiers, named Buddy, played cards with the others, scientists on the base accidentally open a portal to Hell, through which demons poured through, killing the other soldiers. He envisioned a six episode structure with a storyline involving traveling to Hell and back through the gates which the demons used, and the destruction of the planet, for which the players would be sent to jail. Buddy was named after Hall's character in a \"Dungeons & Dragons\" campaign run by John Carmack that had featured a demonic invasion. Hall was forced to rework the \"Doom Bible\" again in December, however, after John Carmack and the rest of the team had decided that they were unable to create a single, seamless world with the hardware limitations of the time, which contradicted much of the new document.\n\nAt the start of 1993, id put out a press release by Hall, touting Buddy's story about fighting off demons while \"knee-deep in the dead\", trying to eliminate the demons and find out what caused them to appear. The press release proclaimed the new game features that John Carmack had created, as well as other features, including multiplayer gaming features, that had not yet been started on by the team or even designed. The company told \"Computer Gaming World\" that \"Doom\" would be \"\"Wolfenstein\" times a million!\" Early versions were built to match the \"Doom Bible\"; a \"pre-alpha\" version of the first level included the other characters at a table and movable rolling chairs based on ones at the id office. Initial versions also retained \"arcade\" elements present in \"Wolfenstein 3D\", like score points and score items, but those were removed early in development as they felt unrealistic and not in keeping with the tone. Other elements, such as a complex user interface, an inventory system, a secondary shield protection, and lives were modified and slowly removed over the course of development.\nSoon, however, the \"Doom Bible\" as a whole was rejected: Romero wanted a game even \"more brutal and fast\" than \"Wolfenstein\", which did not leave room for the character-driven plot Hall had created. Additionally, the team did not feel that they needed a design document at all, as they had not created one for prior games; the \"Doom Bible\" was discarded altogether. Several ideas were retained, including starting off in a military base, as well as some locations, items, and monsters, but the story was dropped and most of the design was removed as the team felt it emphasized realism over entertaining gameplay. Some elements, such as weapons, a hub system of maps, and monorails later appeared in later \"Doom\" or id games. Work continued, and a demo was shown to \"Computer Gaming World\" in early 1993, who raved about it. John Carmack and Romero, however, disliked Hall's military base-inspired level design. Romero especially felt that while John Carmack had originally asked for realistic levels as they would make the engine run quickly, that Hall's level designs were uninspiring. He felt that the boxy, flat levels were too similar to \"Wolfenstein\"s design, and did not show off everything the engine could do. He began to create his own, more abstract levels, beginning with a curving staircase into a large open area in what became the second level of the final game, which the rest of the team felt was much better.\n\nHall was upset with the reception to his designs and how little impact he was having as the lead designer; Romero has since claimed that Hall was also still uninterested in the \"Doom\" concept at all. Hall was also upset with how much he was having to fight with John Carmack in order to get what he saw as obvious gameplay improvements, such as flying enemies. He began to spend less time working in the office, and in response John Carmack proposed that he be fired from id. Romero initially resisted, as it would mean that Hall would not receive any proceeds, but in July he and the other founders of id fired Hall, who went to work for Apogee. Hall was replaced in September, ten weeks before \"Doom\" was released, by game designer Sandy Petersen, despite misgivings over his relatively high age of 37 compared to the other early-20s employees and his religious background. The team also added a third programmer, Dave Taylor. Petersen and Romero designed the rest of the levels for \"Doom\", with different aims: the team felt that Petersen's designs were more technically interesting and varied, while Romero's were more aesthetically interesting. Romero's level design process was to build a level or part of a level, starting at the beginning, then play through it and iterate on the design, so that by the time he was satisfied with the flow and playability of the level he had played it \"a thousand times\". The first level, made by Romero, was the last created, intended to show off the new elements of the engine. The ending screen of each level, like in \"Wolfenstein 3D\", displays a \"par time\" for the level, as set by Romero.\n\nIn late 1993, after the multiplayer component was coded, the development team began playing four-player multiplayer games matches, which Romero termed \"deathmatch\"; he proposed adding a cooperative multiplayer mode as well. According to Romero, the deathmatch mode was inspired by fighting games. The team frequently played \"\", \"Fatal Fury\" and \"Art of Fighting\" during breaks, while developing elaborate rules involving trash-talk and smashing furniture or equipment. Romero later stated that \"you could say that Japanese fighting games fueled the creative impulse to create \"deathmatch\" in our shooters\".\n\n\"Doom\" was programmed largely in the ANSI C language, with a few elements in assembly language, on NeXT computers running the NeXTSTEP operating system. The data, including level designs and graphics files, is stored in WAD files, short for \"Where's All the Data\". This allows for any part of the design to be changed without needing to adjust the engine code. Carmack had been impressed by the modifications made by fans of \"Wolfenstein 3D\", and wanted to support that with an easily swappable file structure, and released the map editor online.\n\nRomero and Carmack spent the early stage of development focusing on engine features instead of the game concept. \"Wolfenstein\" had required levels to be a flat plane, with walls at the same height and at right angles; while the \"Doom\" world was still a variation on a flat plane, in that two traversable areas could not be on top of each other, it could have walls and floors at any angle or height, allowing greater level design variety. The fading visibility in \"ShadowCaster\" was improved by adjusting the color palette by distance, darkening far surfaces and creating a grimmer, more realistic appearance. This concept was also used for the lighting system: rather than calculating how light traveled from light sources to surfaces using ray tracing, the engine calculates the \"light level\" of a section of a level, which can be as small as a single stair step, based on its distance from light sources. It then darkens the color palette of that section's surface textures accordingly. Romero used the map editing tool he developed to build grandiose areas with these new possibilities, and came up with new ways to use Carmack's lighting engine such as strobe lights. He also programmed engine features such as switches and movable stairs and platforms.\n\nIn the first half of 1993, Carmack worked on improving the graphics engine. After Romero's level designs started to cause engine problems, he researched and began to use binary space partitioning to quickly select the portion of a level that the player could see at any given time. In March 1993, the team stopped work on \"Doom\" to spend three weeks building a Super Nintendo Entertainment System port of \"Wolfenstein 3D\", after the contractor hired for the port had made no progress. Taylor, along with programming other features, added cheat codes; some, such as \"idspispopd\", were based on ideas their fans had come up with while eagerly awaiting the game. By late 1993, \"Doom\" was nearing completion and player anticipation was high, spurred on by a leaked press demo. John Carmack began to work on the multiplayer component; within two weeks he had two computers playing the same game over the internal office network. Soon, the office was playing four-player deathmatch games.\n\nAdrian Carmack was the lead artist for \"Doom\", with Kevin Cloud as an additional artist. Additionally, Don Ivan Punchatz was hired to create the package art and logo, and his son Gregor Punchatz created some of the monsters. \"Doom\" was the style of game that Adrian Carmack had wanted to create since id was founded, one with a dark style and demons. He and Cloud designed the monsters to be \"nightmarish\", and developed a new technique for animating them. The intent was to have graphics that were realistic and dark as opposed to staged or rendered, so a mixed media approach was taken to the artwork. Unlike \"Wolfenstein\", where Carmack had drawn every frame of animation for the Nazi enemy sprites, for \"Doom\" the artists sculpted models of some of the enemies out of clay, and took pictures of them in stop motion from five to eight different angles so that they could be rotated realistically in-game; the images were then digitized and converted to 2D characters with a program written by John Carmack. Adrian Carmack made clay models for the player character, the Cyberdemon and the Baron of Hell, before deciding that the problems of keeping the clay consistent under lighting while moving the models through animations was too great. Later, he had practical effects specialist Gregor Punchatz build latex and metal sculptures of the Arch-Vile, Mancubus, Spider Mastermind and Revenant demons. Punchatz got the materials from hardware and hobby stores and used what he called \"rubber band and chewing gum effects\". The weapons were toys, with parts combined from different toys to make more guns. They scanned themselves as well, using Cloud's arm as the model for the player character's arm holding a gun, and Adrian's snakeskin boots and wounded knee for in-game textures. Romero was the body model used for cover; while trying to work with a male model to get a reference photograph for Don Ivan Punchatz to work from, Romero became frustrated while trying to convey to him how to pose as if \"the Marine was going to be attacked by an infinite amount of demons\". Romero posed shirtless as a demonstration of the look he was trying for, and that photograph was the one used by Punchatz. Electronic Arts's \"Deluxe Paint II\" was used in the creation of the sprites.\n\nLike they had for \"Wolfenstein 3D\", id hired Bobby Prince to create the music and sound effects. Romero directed Prince to make the music in techno and metal styles; many of the songs were directly inspired by songs from popular metal bands such as Alice in Chains and Pantera. Prince felt that more ambient music would work better, especially given the hardware limitations of the time on what sounds he could produce, and produced numerous tracks in both styles in the hopes of convincing Romero; Romero, however, still liked the metal tracks and added both styles. Prince did not make music for specific levels; most of the music was composed before the levels they were eventually assigned to were completed. Instead, Romero assigned each track to each level late in development. Unlike the music, the sound effects for the enemies and weapons were created by Prince for specific purposes; Prince designed them based on short descriptions or concept art of a monster or weapon, and then adjusted the sound effects to match the completed animations. The sound effects for the monsters were created from animal noises, and Prince designed all the sound effects to be distinct on the limited sound hardware of the time, even when many sound effects were playing at once.\n\nBecause id planned to self-publish \"Doom\", as it neared completion they had to set up the systems to sell it. Jay Wilbur, who had been brought on as CEO and sole member of the business team, planned the marketing and distribution of \"Doom\". He felt that the mainstream press was uninterested, and as id would make the most money off of copies they sold directly to customers—up to 85 percent of the planned US$40 price—he decided to leverage the shareware market as much as possible, buying only a single ad in any gaming magazine. Instead, he reached out directly to software retailers, offering them copies of the first \"Doom\" episode for free, allowing them to charge any price for it, in order to spur customer interest in buying the full game directly from id.\n\n\"Doom\"s original release date was the third quarter of 1993, which the team did not meet. By December 1993, the team was working non-stop, with several employees sleeping at the office; programmer Dave Taylor claimed that the work gave him such a rush that he would pass out from the intensity. Id began receiving calls from people interested in the game or angry that it had missed its planned release date, as hype for the game had been building online. At midnight on Friday, December 10, 1993, after working for 30 straight hours, the team uploaded the first episode to the internet, letting interested players distribute it for them. So many users were connected to the first network that they planned to upload the game to—the University of Wisconsin–Parkside FTP network—that even after the network administrator increased the number of connections while on the phone with Wilbur, id was unable to connect, forcing them to kick all other users off to allow id to upload the game. When the upload finished thirty minutes later, 10,000 people attempted to download it at once, crashing the university's network. Within hours, other university networks were banning \"Doom\" multiplayer games, as a rush of players overwhelmed their systems.\n\nWhile \"Doom\" was in development, five pre-release versions were given names or numbers and shown to testers or the press.\n\n\n"}

He played in the NBA for 10 seasons and led the league in 3-point shooting percentage three times. He won two NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls, and along with Larry Bird, is one of only two players to win three consecutive Three Point Contests at the National Basketball Association All-Star Weekend, winning the competition in 1990, 1991, and 1992. Hodges also holds the Three Point Contest records for the most consecutive shots made with 19, set in 1991, and the most points scored in a single round at 25, set in 1986. He was later a head coach at Chicago State University, an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers and head coach of the Halifax Rainmen of the National Basketball League of Canada.\n\nBorn in Park Forest, Illinois, Hodges played college basketball at Long Beach State from 1978 to 1982. He played under Tex Winter, who later coached him again as an assistant to Phil Jackson with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nDuring his career in the NBA, Hodges played for the San Diego Clippers, Milwaukee Bucks, Phoenix Suns, and Chicago Bulls. He played for the Bulls from 1988 to 1992, and helped them win two NBA Championships in 1991 and 1992. He was waived by the Bulls after the 1991–92 season.\n\nAfter sitting out the NBA season, he played a season with Clear Cantù in the Italian league.\n\nHodges appeared in the first eight NBA All-Star Three Point Contests from 1986 to 1993, and won the contest three times, in 1990, 1991, and 1992. He reached the final round on two other occasions, in 1986 when he lost to Larry Bird, and in 1989, when he lost to Dale Ellis.\n\nHodges holds the Three Point Contest records for the most consecutive shots made with 19 (1991) and is tied with Jason Kapono for most points scored in a single round at 25 (1986). He is tied with Hubert Davis for the highest score in the semifinal round at 24 (1991) and with six other players for the most bonus balls made with five (1989). Hodges has the second highest three-round combined score with 61 (1991).\n\nHodges competed in the Three Point Contest at the 1993 NBA All-Star Weekend as a free agent after he was waived by the Bulls in 1992 and did not sign with an NBA team for the 1992–93 season. The NBA initially left him off the field of contestants as he was not on an NBA roster at the time, but eventually allowed him to defend his 1992 title. Hodges wore a generic \"NBA\" jersey in the contest. Hodges was eliminated after the semifinal, finishing behind eventual winner Mark Price and Terry Porter.\n\nCareer Three Point Contest record\n\nFrom 1994 to 1996, Hodges coached college basketball at Chicago State University, and was fired in 1996 with a win-loss record of 8–51 over two-plus seasons.\n\nIn September 2005, Hodges joined the Los Angeles Lakers as a special assistant coach under his former Bulls coach, Phil Jackson. He worked with individual players on offensive skills, primarily shooting. Jackson retired after the 2010–11 season, and Hodges' contract with the Lakers expired as well. Hodges also coached the Halifax Rainmen in the Canadian Basketball League for half a season, and during his time as head coach of the Rainmen, was invited by Dennis Rodman to play in North Korea, but he was denied entry into that country, citing \"I was looking forward to the opportunity of going and helping Dennis, as far as the basketball end of things\", and saying \"I'm for human rights, and so going to North Korea wasn't a matter of me going to rub political shoulders with the man that's in power. It was as a goodwill gesture, as a brotherhood — a brotherhood of sport,\"\n\nAfter serving as an assistant coach for the Westchester Knicks during the 2014–15 D-League season, he was named the team's interim coach for the final four games of the season on March 30, 2015 after head coach Kevin Whitted was fired.\n\nHodges is currently head coach of Rich East High School in his hometown of Park Forest, Illinois.\n\nWhen the Chicago Bulls visited the White House after winning the 1992 NBA Championship, Hodges dressed in a dashiki and delivered a hand-written letter addressed to then President George H. W. Bush, expressing his discontent at the administration's treatment of the poor and minorities.\n\nHodges also criticized his Bulls teammate Michael Jordan for not using his fame to draw attention to social and political issues, and said Jordan was \"bailing out\" for not being politically outspoken.\n\nIn 1996, Hodges filed a $40 million lawsuit against the NBA and its then 29 teams, claiming they blackballed him for his association with Louis Farrakhan and criticism of \"African-American professional athletes who failed to use their considerable wealth and influence to assist the poor and disenfranchised.\" After he was waived by the Bulls in 1992, he did not receive an offer or a tryout from a single NBA team, even though he was only 32 years old and still able to contribute to contenders. The lawsuit claimed that Bulls assistant coach Jim Cleamons told him that the team was troubled by his criticism of players' lack of involvement in inner-city communities. The suit also claimed Billy McKinney, the director of player personnel for the Seattle SuperSonics initially showed interest in Hodges in 1992, and then shortly after backed away, telling Hodges he could do nothing because \"brothers have families, if you know what I mean.\" While a Bulls official said Hodges was waived as he was getting old and could not play defense, head coach Phil Jackson said, \"I also found it strange that not a single team called to inquire about him. Usually, I get at least one call about a player we've decided not to sign. And yes, he couldn't play much defense, but a lot of guys in the league can't, but not many can shoot from his range, either.\"\n\nIn 2014, Hodges was named to a team assembled by Dennis Rodman as part of his \"basketball diplomacy\" effort in North Korea with the job of playing an exhibition match against the North Korean Senior National Team to celebrate the birthday of Kim Jong-Un. He failed to actually make it into the country as his flight from Canada to Beijing was delayed, causing him to miss the connecting flight to Pyonyang and prompting the Chinese government to send him immediately back to Canada.\n\nHodges' personal life included a well-publicized incident in 1991 when his estranged wife, Carlita Hodges doused him in gasoline and attempted to light him on fire.

The other two states seceded ineffectively or only by an irregular means, and hence remained within the Union. \n\nThe first seven seceding states, all of the Deep South, were motivated mainly by two factors: the election in November 1860 of Abraham Lincoln, who had no support in the South, and the perceived direct threat to slavery his election posed.\n\nThe next four states to secede also were motivated by the same two factors, but a third and decisive factor was the Federal policy of coercion, or using military force to preserve the Union by compelling the earlier seceding states to submit. \n\nIn the remaining two states, attempted secession was belated and severely disrupted. In Missouri, the state government called a convention, but its members disfavored secession. Federal military intervention quickly restored Union control, first in St. Louis, then throughout nearly the whole state. Its ordinance of secession eventually was passed only by a rump convention meeting at Neosho. In Kentucky, whose potential secession Unionists particularly feared, both the legislature and public opinion firmly opposed secession. Only an even less influential rump convention purported to secede. When Confederate armies invaded Kentucky in 1862, briefly seizing the state capital and installing an ephemeral state government, they found local recruitment weak and popular support conspicuously lacking, despite bringing extra arms to equip new volunteers. This unexpected discovery helped defeat the campaign as the Confederate generals felt they lacked the strength of numbers to confront the larger Union forces that eventually maneuvered to oppose them. Despite Missouri and Kentucky thus remaining within the Union, thousands from both states embraced secession by choosing to fight for the Confederacy. \n\nThough generally accepted only to have comprised 11 seceding states, these 13 states and one territory formed, by its own contemporary definition as shown by 13 stars in its official and battle flags, the Confederate States of America.\n\nElsewhere, overwhelming Union military intervention and mass arrests of elected lawmakers blocked the secessionist Maryland legislature even from considering the question. The Delaware legislature did, quickly and overwhelmingly rejecting secession. The unorganized Indian Territory did not document secession and was not unanimous in its orientation, but generally supported the Confederacy.\n\nIn several states, effective secession in most of the state critically destabilized or virtually eliminated state government control over a region where people widely rejected secession, favoring the Union over their state. This was particularly true of Virginia, leading to the creation of West Virginia. The same effect occurred in part of Tennessee and in other areas, but did not result in any split of other states.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1825905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825905", "title": "Merredin, Western Australia", "text": "Merredin, Western Australia\n\nMerredin is a town in Western Australia, located in the central Wheatbelt roughly midway between Perth and Kalgoorlie, on Route 94, Great Eastern Highway. It is located on the route of the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme, and as a result is also on the Golden Pipeline Heritage Trail.\n\nIt is connected by public transport to Perth via Transwa Prospector and MerredinLink rail services.\n\nMerredin's history varies from that of other wheat-belt towns in Western Australia in the sense that it started as a stopping place on the way to the goldfields. The first European explorer into the area was the Surveyor General J. S. Roe, who travelled through the region in 1836 but was not impressed by its dryness and the low rainfall.\n\nBy the 1850s sandalwood cutters were in the area but there was little agriculture. It was not until Assistant Surveyor Charles Cooke Hunt explored the area in the period 1864–66 that it began to open up. Hunt saw the pastoral potential but realised the importance of water. He called the area Hampton Plains after John Stephen Hampton, Governor of Western Australia 1862–68.\n\nHunt made five journeys through the area. Of the five journeys the first was exploratory (1864), the second established a track which moved from waterhole to waterhole (1865) and the third built a series of wells and dams (the Hunt's Dam at Merredin is located about 10 kilometres north of town off the Merredin-Chandler Road). The result was a road which later became known as the York to Goldfields road and, until the arrival of the railway, was the only link between the coast and the gold towns of Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie.\n\nIt is almost certain that Hunt climbed Merredin Peak (a short distance out of town to the north) and that he heard the town's name from the local Aboriginal people. Hunt claimed that the local Aborigines referred to the place as \"Merriding\" while other explanations suggest that the name comes from \"merrit-in\" – \"the place of the merrit\" (merrit being a kind of tree which was used for making spears) – or that it was the name used by the Aborigines to describe the \"huge bare granite rock\" which the locals call Merredin Rock but which is officially named Merredin Peak.\n\nIn the late 1860s a number of large pastoral leases were taken up in the area but no township evolved. As late as 1889, when Assistant Surveyor Henry King set up camp on the north side of Merredin Rock, there was still no township. The first settlement was established to the north of Merredin Peak on the York to the Goldfields road but it was hastily moved when the railway, which could not follow the gradients of Hunts Road, was built a few kilometres to the south.\n\nIn 1888 the area to the east of Merredin was officially proclaimed a goldfield and over the next decade prospectors and fossickers poured through the area. Gold was discovered at Coolgardie in 1892 and at Kalgoorlie a year later. At first the prospectors used Hunt's waterholes road and this meant that they passed through the site of the modern town. In 1893 the narrow-gauge (3 ft 6 in) railway that was being continually extended Eastwards from Perth, reached the town. Merredin's importance as a town was directly related to the establishment of a superb water catchment scheme on Merredin Peak. The narrow-gauge railway was extended eastwards from Merredin to Southern Cross in July 1894, and to Kalgoorlie in January 1897.\n\nA rock wall was built around the contours of Merredin Peak. It led to a 100 m channel which in turn led into a dam which had a storage capacity of 25 million litres. The scheme held every drop of water which landed on the Peak and directed it all into the dam which provided water for both the town and the railway. The entire structure is still intact and can be easily reached at the northern end of town. Constructed between 1893 and 1896, the Railway Dam ensured that Merredin would become much more than just another wheat-belt siding.\n\nThe need for the water from Merredin Peak disappeared in 1903 when C. Y. O'Connor's 565 km pipeline was completed. The pipeline joined the waterless goldfields at Kalgoorlie and Boulder with the plentiful supplies of water in the Helena River east of Perth. Merredin Peak's Railway Dam continued to supply water to the railway until 1968 and even today is still used as the water supply for the fountain outside the Merredin Railway Museum and railway station.\n\nIn 1904 the Agricultural Research Station was established. It was here that the Bencubbin strain of wheat was developed. Land in the present townsite was offered for sale in 1906 and by 1911 the Merredin Roads Board had been formed.\n\nThe narrow-gauge rail line from Merredin to Bruce Rock was built in 1913 to serve the developing sheep and wheat belt area of W.A, now known as the Great Southern. \nThe final section of the Narrogin-Merredin narrow-gauge rail line, from Bruce Rock to Corrigin, was built in 1915, thus completing the narrow-gauge rail link that linked Merredin and Narrogin.\n\nEric Hind was born in Nottingham in England in 1901. He migrated to Western Australia in 1926 and came immediately to the Wheatbelt. In 1928 he took up farming land at Burracoppin and so commenced a lifetime of interest in the Burracoppin Area.\nDuring the Second World War Eric enlisted in the R.A.A.F and served overseas.\nIn 1953 he was elected to the then Merredin Road Board and continued to represent the people of Burracoppin on the Merredin Shire Council until his retirement in 1989.\nAfter 36 years of service on the Road Board and Shire Council, the Merredin Shire Council presented Eric with a long service award and made him a Freeman of the Shire. In 1990 he received the Order of Australia Medal for services to the community.\n\nEric Hind was an accomplished violinist who had gained his A.L.C.M (Eng) diploma before leaving England. As an active member of the Merredin Musical Society and Concert Orchestra of the day, Eric was much sought after as a violinist and was willing to perform at any function if possible. Eric also served on the local W.A Symphony Orchestra Committee and was instrumental in getting many concerts in Merredin over a number of years.\nIn his honour, the Merredin Shire Council offers a music scholarship to the value of $1000.00.\n\nDuring World War 2, Merredin was the location of RAAF No.26 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot (IAFD), built in 1942 and closed on 14 June 1944. It was situated on Cummings Street and has since had a house built on top. Usually consisting of 4 tanks, 31 fuel depots were built across Australia for the storage and supply of aircraft fuel for the RAAF and the US Army Air Corps at a total cost of £900,000 ($1,800,000).\n\nMerredin was the location of number 4 pumping station of the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme,\nwhich was rebuilt a number of times.\n\nMerredin experiences a steppe climate (Köppen climate classification \"BSh\").\n\nThe agricultural land around Merredin produces 40% of Western Australia's wheat quota. As a focal point for the region, Merredin's local bulk handling co-operative receives and processes in excess of a million tonnes of grain every year. The silos at the train facilities to the west of the main town are the biggest of their type in the southern hemisphere.\n\nOne of the biggest problems to face the agricultural industry in Merredin is salinity. Extensive damage to buildings and roads is caused by rising saline groundwater. A recent study showed that the main source of this water is Merredin townsite itself. Roads, footpaths, buildings and open space have replaced native vegetation adapted to use up every drop of rain. Since the problem arose in the early 1970s, farmers and townspeople have been participating in a number of programs to improve the soil conditions, with some limited success.\n\nMerredin aerodrome is leased under a 100-year lease arrangement by China Southern West Australian Flying College, a Western Australian Joint Venture Company (JVC) owned by China Southern Airlines (PRC) and CAE Inc. (Canada) and was used as one of two pilot training facilities until September 2016. CSWAFC also operated, and continues to operate from Jandakot Airport in Perth. Merredin airport was leased for the sum of one Australian Dollar with the state government banking that investment would follow.\nThe partnership in the years since has been successful. Upgraded facilities include bitumen runways, an operations viewing platform (which does not fulfil the regulatory requirements of a control tower), fire control equipment, hangars, classrooms, and housing. Although the aerodrome is leased by China Southern West Australian Flying College, the RFDS and private users still have access.\n\nAs of September 2016, the training school suspended operations in Merredin due to its inability to attract sufficient numbers of experienced staff with the appropriate regulatory approvals. Since then, issues have been raised over the leasehold arrangements.\n\nMerredin is located on the Eastern Goldfields Railway.\n\nMerredin serves as the middle stop of the Prospector train. At Merredin, the train stops for a scheduled 10 minutes, giving passengers a chance to stretch their legs. There, the train stewards disembark and serve the Prospector going back to Perth, so they never go any farther. The same is true for Kalgoorlie stewards, who disembark and get onto the Kalgoorlie train. It is also the terminus for the Avonlink rural train service.\n\n\nThe following people were either born or raised in Merredin and have gone on to achieve successful careers in a wide range of areas.\n\n"}

Established in 1909, the art school grants bachelor of fine arts degrees and graduate degrees including the master of fine arts (MFA) and master of arts (MA) degrees. It has an enrollment of about 500 students. PNCA actively participates in Portland's cultural life through a public program of exhibitions, lectures, and internationally recognized visual artists, designers, and creative thinkers.\n\nThe college has 12 Bachelor of Fine Arts majors and eight graduate programs, a dual-degree MA/MFA option, and a Post-Baccalaureate program within the Hallie Ford School of Graduate Studies. PNCA also provides Community Education in art and design to the local community.\n\nFounded in 1909 as part of the Portland Art Museum, the school was originally known as the Museum Art School with Anna Belle Crocker serving as the head of the school, and Kate Cameron Simmons as the first hired teacher. After the Pietro Belluschi designed home of the museum opened in 1932, the school moved into the upper floors of the building. In 1981, the school changed its name to Pacific Northwest College of Art in order to reflect its independence from the museum. The independence was solidified in April 1994 when the college formally split from the art museum and was incorporated as a legal entity distinct from the museum.\n\nIn 1998, the college moved to its former campus in Portland's Pearl District. PNCA hired Thomas Manley in 2003 as president of the institution, replacing Sally Lawrence. Manley proposed a plan to the school's board in 2004 to expand the college and move towards Portland's North Park Blocks. This plan received a boost in 2007 when Hallie Ford donated $15 million to the school.\n\nThe school purchased the building housing the college in 2008, and also that year was given the 511 Federal Building by the federal government as part of a surplus building program. In 2009, the then independent Museum of Contemporary Craft moved into the DeSoto Building, which drained the museum's finances. This led to PNCA loaning the museum money, and to a partnership and possible merger.\n\nIn 2012, the school announced they would centralize their programs in Portland's Old Town at the 511 Federal Building. PNCA opened their first residence hall in August 2013 at a cost of $7.3 million, called ArtHouse. As part of its move to the Old Town area, the college sold its main building in the Pearl District in 2013 for $11.75 million. The school secured $20 million in loans from the Portland Development Commission in November 2013 to fund the renovations. Renovations were completed in January 2015, with classes starting at the new campus in February 2015.\n\nIn late 2018, the college briefly explored merging with the Oregon College of Art and Craft but they decided against the merger.\n\nAs of February 2015, PNCA's main campus building is located at 511 NW Broadway in northwest Portland, in the Pearl District. Known previously as the 511 Federal Building, it is a former post office that is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe college opened its first student housing in 2013 with the completion of ArtHouse at NW Park and Couch. The six-story building has 50 apartments, plus retail space on the ground floor. Designed by architect Thomas Robinson, the project cost $7.3 million to build the modernistic structure. ArtHouse was built where Powell’s Technical Books was located and is managed by College Housing Northwest.\n\nPNCA's exhibition department is the Center for Contemporary Art & Culture (CCAC), which is a platform for cultural production including exhibition, lecture, performance, and publication. CCAC is directed by Mack McFarland and has exhibited artist such as Wangechi Mutu, Cauleen Smith, James Rosenquist, David Horvitz. CCAC is made up of two galleries, the 511 Gallery (formerly the Philip Feldman Gallery + Project Space) and the Dorothy Lemelson Innovation Studio. Additional exhibition spaces include Holt Gallery, Gallery 157, Gallery B10, and New Commons. The Lodge Gallery @ Allied Works Architecture host regular exhibitions.\n\nIn March, 2008, PNCA announced the U.S. Department of Education and the General Services Administration approved PNCA's application to make the 511 Federal Building a permanent part of the school's campus. Located on the North Park Blocks, the building was renovated for use by the college in 2014–15. After the $30 million in renovations were complete in February 2015, the building was renamed as the Arlene and Harold Schnitzer Center for Art and Design.\n\nThe school is accredited by both the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD) and the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). PNCA is affiliated with the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, the Art Resources Consortium Northwest, the Oregon Independent College Association, and the Foundations in Art: Theory and Education.\nPNCA offers 12 undergraduate programs and eight graduate level programs. The college offers Bachelor of Fine Art degrees in majors including: Animated Arts, Communication Design, General Fine Art, Illustration, Interactive Design, Intermedia, Painting, Photography, Printmaking, Sculpture, Video and Sound, and Creative Writing. As well, it offers minors in Art and Ecology, Art History, Ceramics, Creative Writing, Drawing, Fashion, Game, and Graphic Design.\n\nGraduate programs within the Hallie Ford School of Graduate Studies include a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Visual Studies, an MFA in Applied Craft and Design, an MFA in Collaborative Design, a Master of Arts in Critical Studies, a Master of Arts in Design Systems, an MFA in Print Media, a low residency MFA in Visual Studies, and a Low Residency MFA in Creative Writing, as well as a dual MA/MFA degree program.\n\nIn addition to degrees, the college offers four certificate programs in fine arts, graphic design, digital publishing, and illustration through its Community Education program.

{"id": "1825914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1825914", "title": "Musa (film)", "text": "Musa (film)\n\nMusa (; lit. \"Warrior\"), released as both \"The Warrior\" and \"The Ultimate Warrior\" in English-speaking countries, is a 2001 South Korean epic action drama film directed by Kim Sung-su, starring Jung Woo-sung, Ahn Sung-ki, Joo Jin-mo and Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi. The semi-historical story follows the adventures of a Korean peace delegation as they try to get back to Korea through the inhospitable deserts of northern China.\n\nThe film is regarded as being one of the biggest motion pictures in the history of South Korean cinema. At the time of its production its budget was the largest ever for a Korean film. It features a high degree of historical accuracy in period costumery, props, settings, and most unusually, language; that is, everyone speaks in their native tongues or through an interpreter conversant in a lingua franca. The film was the 8th highest grossing film of 2001 with over two million tickets sold.\n\nIn 1375, a small diplomatic mission from the Korean kingdom Goryeo travels to Ming China to meet the Hongwu Emperor, but they are arrested in retaliation for the death of a Chinese diplomat in Goryeo. They are put in chains and taken across a desert. However, Mongol raiders suddenly show up and kill the Chinese soldiers transporting them, while killing some Koreans in the process. The Mongols ride off, leaving the rest of the Koreans to die of hunger or thirst.\n\nThe head of the Korean soldiers in the group, General Choi-Jung, takes command because the two diplomats are dead. Later, they discover that the Mongols have kidnapped the Hongwu Emperor's daughter so they ambush the Mongol convoy and rescue the princess. Yeo-sol, a former slave of one of the diplomats, defeats the Mongol general Rambulwha in single combat, but allows the latter to live and escape.\n\nThe Koreans flee with the princess, determined to return her safely to the Chinese capital, Nanjing, to atone for their diplomatic failure. The Mongols give chase in the hope of recovering the princess and presenting her to their Khan while the Koreans head towards a coastal fortress the princess tells them about, where they expect to find safe haven. Along the way, the Koreans pick up some Chinese peasants who are also fleeing from the Mongols.\n\nFighting their way through Mongol search parties, the group experiences many internal conflicts stemming from social class, love, and honour. The lower-class soldiers chafe under their poor treatment in comparison to the soldiers of the upper-class. They have little confidence in their young general, and prefer taking orders from their veteran sergeant, Dae-Jung. The princess has difficulty adjusting to the rough necessities of her position on the run. Choi-Jung and Yeo-sol become nemeses, competing for the affections of the princess and exchanging blows on several occasions.\n\nWhen the group finally reaches the fortress, they are disappointed to see that it is nothing more than abandoned ruins. At the same time, the Mongols have caught up with them and have set up a camp outside the fortress. As the Koreans prepare to make a last stand, the princess attempts to give herself up to the Mongols in exchange for peace, but Yeo-sol and Choi-Jung stop her. A fight breaks out between the two men and the Mongols, resulting in Yeo-sol being captured. Rambulwha, who is impressed with Yeo-sol's skill, offers to let the latter join his army but Yeo-sol refuses and returns to the fortress to help his fellows. In the final battle, the defenders' gunpowder traps backfire when the Mongols launch a fire attack and stage a raid on the fortress. Yeo-sol sacrifices himself to save the princess while Choi-Jung and Rambulwha kill each other. All the Koreans perish along with their Mongol enemies, except for Dae-Jung. The princess stays with the peasants at the fortress and promises to tell her father of the Koreans' sacrifice while Dae-Jung builds a makeshift raft and sails back to Goryeo.\n\n\nThe film presents a fictionalised account of a real Korean diplomatic mission sent to China in 1375. Chun-Yong Son was to present a herd of horses as gifts to the Hongwu Emperor but he and his party were reported to have been exiled and there was no record of their return to Korea. At the time, the Ming government was unhappy with Korea as the Korean government continued to acknowledge the Mongols as the legitimate rulers of China (this was true until 1378). Eventually the Koreans managed to gain favour with the Ming government and the relationship became very cordial.\n\nThe film also portrays the political conflicts in China at the time, between the fading Mongol-ruled Yuan dynasty and the new Ming dynasty that returned China to Han Chinese rule.\n\n"}

Scientific Atlanta was founded in 1951 by a group of engineers from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and was purchased by Cisco Systems in 2005 for $6.9 billion after Cisco received antitrust clearance for the purchase. The Cisco acquisition of Scientific Atlanta was ranked in the top 10 of largest technology acquisitions in history and was Cisco's largest acquisition to date. Prior to the purchase, Scientific Atlanta had been a Fortune 500 company and was one of the top 25 largest corporations in Georgia.\n\nScientific Atlanta was considered by many to be \"the patriarch of Atlanta's technology industry for nearly six decades\" and is sometimes referred to as \"Atlanta's Microsoft or Hewlett Packard\". It was considered \"core to the development of technology in the Atlanta region\" and \"was to Atlanta what Hewlett-Packard was to Silicon Valley\" because of its legacy of spawning more than 35 substantial companies in the area.\n\nScientific Atlanta is a supplier of transmission networks for broadband access to the home, set-top cable boxes, cable modems and digital interactive subscriber systems for video, high-speed Internet, voice over IP (VoIP) networks, and worldwide customer service and support.\n\nProducts for the cable TV industry, from fiber optic network equipment for head-end media acquisition, to Explorer digital cable boxes (as well as universal remotes to go with them), and cable modems (formerly branded as WebSTAR until the Cisco acquisition in 2006), dominate Scientific Atlanta's sales. Scientific Atlanta's most popular modem is the Scientific Atlanta 2100, because it is often supplied by cable providers like Spectrum, Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Cox Communications. Scientific Atlanta also supplies distribution technology to networks such as Bloomberg Television, CNN, ESPN and many others.\n\nIn addition to providing products for traditional coaxial and fiber service operators, Scientific Atlanta also expanded its IPTV solutions offerings after the merger with Cisco. Before this, on August 18, 2005, Scientific-Atlanta and SBC (now AT&T) signed a deal for Scientific-Atlanta to be the exclusive set-top provider for SBC U-verse TV.\n\nFounded in October 1951 by six Georgia Tech Research Institute researchers: James E. Boyd (future station director), Charles Griffin, Robert E. Honer (MSEE), Gerald Rosselot (station director), Lamar Whittle and Vernon Widerquist who each invested $100. In late 1952 Glen P. Robinson became the seventh member. Scientific Atlanta was started to produce technology developed at the research station. After the fledgling company's first contract resulted in a $4,000 loss, Robinson bought out all but one of the original investors, and paid them each back their original $100.\n\nGlen P. Robinson served as CEO of Scientific Atlanta for 20 years, and chairman of the board for an additional eight years, until he retired from the company in 1979. Scientific Atlanta grew dramatically; it earned $3.1 million in revenue in 1962 and approximately $200 million when Robinson left. Sidney Topol served as its president from 1971–83, CEO from 1975–87, and chairman of the board from 1978-90. During his tenure, the company grew in sales to more than $600 million. During the 1970s the company developed the concept of cable/satellite connection, which, in working with HBO and transportable earth stations developed by TelePrompTer Corporation and manufactured by Scientific Atlanta, established satellite-delivered television for the cable industry.\n\nDuring the 1960s Scientific-Atlanta earned a place in the space and defense industries as a manufacturer of electronic testing equipment for antennae. By the end of that decade the company had added instruments for testing telephones and acoustic devices with defense applications. As a military contractor, the company distinguished itself by manufacturing unique electronic instruments for the federal government. According to \"Business Week\", Scientific-Atlanta was a company \"fascinated with communications esoterica.\"\n\nScientific-Atlanta applied its energy to opportunities in new fields with large growth potential and few barriers to entry. The company sought out products that were either low-cost and high volume or had a very high price tag. \"You've either got to make 10,000 of something worth $100 to $200, or several of something worth $500,000 or $10 million,\" Topol told the \"New York Times\". The company planned to make the low-cost, high volume end of this equation profitable through aggressive research and development and a strong marketing effort. In its annual report, as reprinted in David C. Rickert's Harvard Business School case study of Scientific-Atlanta, the company stated: \"Scientific-Atlanta operates under a disciplined business plan that concentrates on design, manufacture, and sale of standard technical products for the communications and instrumentation markets.\" More specifically, Topol recounted in Dun's Review, as restated by Rickert, \"I asked what products we needed for growing markets, not what markets we should go after because we had a product.\"\n\nThe answer to that question was telecommunications products, primarily the satellite earth station, a large mobile dish used to receive signals transmitted from communications satellites orbiting the earth. In 1973 the company displayed a portable satellite earth station at a communications trade show in California. It planned to sell the portable stations to companies in the relatively new and rapidly growing cable television field so they could transmit their programming to a large number of stations in different areas. The stations, in turn, would send the programming to consumers' homes over their cable networks. At the time, however, observers told Scientific-Atlanta executives that satellite transmission of cable television programming would take place only in the distant future.\n\nThese predictions proved incorrect and as the cable television industry boomed in the mid- to late 1970s, Scientific-Atlanta grew with it. The company's profits ballooned by 40 percent a year from 1972 on as Scientific-Atlanta came to dominate the market it had largely pioneered. In 1976, as sales rose to more than $45 million, the company greatly expanded its manufacturing, laboratory, and office space at its headquarters. It sold two-thirds of the 3,000 satellite earth stations purchased by cable companies during the 1970s, enabling its clients—broadcasters such as Home Box Office (HBO) and Showtime/The Movie Channel—to become pillars of the cable broadcasting industry. Scientific-Atlanta's strength in satellite earth stations helped to enhance its overall sales of cable television equipment, and the company also began to market other components necessary to operate a cable television system.\n\nIn addition to its satellite products for the cable industry, Scientific-Atlanta manufactured testing and measuring devices for telecommunications, industrial, and laboratory use. The company added to its instrumentation operations when it acquired the San Diego-based Spectral Dynamics Corporation, a manufacturer of scientific devices, in 1978 for $17.4 million. Spectral Dynamics brought with it European sales subsidiaries in Germany, France, England, and the Netherlands. With these additions, Scientific-Atlanta had sales network that covered 40 countries and was supported by a worldwide service network that adjusted and repaired its instruments. Both Scientific-Atlanta and Spectral Dynamics relied on continual research and development to bring new products to market, thereby enhancing market share and fostering company growth.\n\nBy the start of 1979 Scientific-Atlanta employed 2,700 people. That year the company also introduced Homesat, a subsidiary formed to market satellite equipment to homeowners who lived in areas too remote to receive adequate television reception.\n\nIn addition to its two main areas of operation—communications and instrumentation—Scientific-Atlanta entered the field of home security and energy management during the 1970s. The company marketed wireless home alarm systems and provided equipment to utilities that enabled them to monitor home energy use.\n\nBy the dawn of the 1980s, Scientific Atlanta had become the world's largest supplier of satellite earth stations.\n\nIn August 2002, the company laid off 6 percent of the company's total.\n\nIn February 2003, Scientific-Atlanta introduced their first Explorer HD set-top box, which is capable of displaying HDTV programming, at Best Buy stores in the Phoenix metropolitan area. It was later rolled out nationwide. In March 2004, Scientific-Atlanta launched the Explorer 8000HD, their first set-top box with both DVR and HD.\n\nIn the set-top arena, Scientific-Atlanta once enjoyed 100% market share with Time Warner Cable, Cablevision and AT&T U-verse; all three companies have since started to transition to other boxes, Cablevision using Samsung, while TWC and U-verse are split between SA/Cisco and competitor Arris (formerly Motorola). Comcast also has a split account with the two companies. Other companies that have split accounts with SA and Arris are Suddenlink Communications, Charter Communications and Cox; the two vendors also had split accounts for Adelphia before that company went under in 2006. Pace plc, who mainly competes in foreign markets, serves as a domestic rival, but on a limited scale.\n\nOn November 18, 2005, Scientific Atlanta announced that it would be purchased by Cisco Systems in a US$6.9 billion cash deal. On February 25, 2006, Cisco Systems announced that it had completed acquisition of Scientific Atlanta in a cash deal that paid $43 per share. The total cash value of the deal was roughly US$7 billion, or US$5.1 billion net of Scientific Atlanta's cash balance, and also about US$5.1 billion over their 2005 shareholders' equity. In its fiscal year 2005, Scientific Atlanta earned $1.36 per common share (diluted).\n\nOn November 21, 2015, Cisco completed sale of its Connected Devices Business Unit (CDBU) to Technicolor SA. This business was comprised primarily by customer premises equipment (CPE) related hardware and software that had originated at Scientific Atlanta, including set top boxes, cable gateways / modems, CableCard devices, digital transport adapters, wireless video access points, network extenders, accessories and eleven software products related to these offerings.\n\nThe company was honored at the 2008 Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for development of interactive video on demand infrastructure and signaling, leading to large scale VOD implementations.\n\n"}

He studied with Maurice Duruflé before attending the Paris Conservatoire. Pierre Boulez was a fellow student but their careers followed very different paths. In 1957 Villette was appointed director of the Conservatoire in Besançon, the capital of the Franche-Comté region. He was dogged by ill health and had a lung removed while still in his twenties. His bad health forced him to move from mountainous Besançon to a warmer climate, and he became director of the Academy at Aix en Provence in 1967. He held this position until he retired in 1987, and he continued to live in Provence until his death in 1998.\n\nVillette's music is a product of a French musical heritage that includes Fauré and Debussy as well as Poulenc and Messiaen, and a French cultural legacy that includes Catholicism and the Order of Saint Benedict. Villette was not interested in the avant-garde direction taken by Boulez's circle, and instead his music drew on influences as eclectic as Gregorian Chant, medieval music, jazz (he composed an orchestral piece titled \"Blues\"), and Stravinsky. His catalogue has eighty-one opus numbers, (full list via this link) and he wrote chamber and orchestral music as well as better-known choral works.\n\nVillette's compositions are performed around the world. His choral music was championed in England by Dr Donald Hunt in the 1970s when he was director of Worcester Cathedral Choir, and Villette's \"Hymne à la Vierge\", which is probably his best-known work, has been performed in the annual Service of Nine Lessons and Carols at King's College, Cambridge. Choirs in the US, Japan, and Germany are also familiar with Villette's compositions. Strangely, however, he has never been widely performed in his native France, probably because he held regional positions in a country where artistic life is dominated by Paris.\n"}

It is located at Highway 62 West, five miles (8 km) west of Eureka Springs, Arkansas, and open daily to the public during warmer months for a fee.\n\nThe spring pours 38 million US gallons (140,000 m³) of water daily into the trout-filled lagoon. Blue Spring has been a tourist attraction since 1948, and is now on the National Register of Historic Places for its archaeological significance as a site occupied between the Early Archaic and the Mississippian periods.\n\nHistorians from several Indian nations, including the Tsalagi (Cherokee), Osage and Quapaw, say their people have been making journeys to, and living intermittently at Blue Spring for tens of thousands of years. Artifacts excavated at the Blue Spring Shelter support this, as they date back to between 8000 B.C. and A.D. 1500.\n\nThe American Indian people who lived here in ancient times (10,000 years ago and beyond to 500 B.C.) are known as the ‘Bluff Dwellers’. These indigenous people populated not only the Blue Spring area, but much of the Ozark Mountains. They lived beneath giant bluff shelters such as this one. As most human beings of their time, they hunted, gathered, and planted. Tools, clothes and many other necessary items were made from many native plants and animals available to them. They also traded goods with other Indian nations.\n\nIndigenous people who lived here between 500 B.C. and A.D. 900 continued to hunt, gather, plant and trade, though planting gardens had become a more prominent activity. With over 62% of the world's food having been developed by American Indians, it is no surprise that the Indians of the Ozarks domesticated maygrass, lamb's quarter, knotweek, sumpweek, sunflower, squash, and strains of little barley. The bottomlands and terraces of the White River provided fertile garden spots for the indigenous occupants of the Blue Spring Shelter.\n\nFrom A.D. 900 to A.D. 1541, agriculture had become an integral part of many Indian communities in the Ozarks and Arkansas area. They depended mostly on maize, squash and beans. As always, hunting, gathering and trading remained an important part of society. The Blue Spring Shelter continued to be used by Indian people for short and long term camps, and for ceremony.\n\nIn recent history (1541 to present), Tsalagi (Cherokee) people made a stop at Blue Spring on the “Trail of Tears” during the late 1830s. Indian people continue to spend time at Blue Spring and Blue Spring Shelter. Today, visits and ceremonies by Indian people such as Lenape, Musogee, Cherokee, and Lakota take place at the Blue Spring Shelter regularly. It remains a place of peace, healing, and connection.\n\n\n"}

Instead of using his high leg kick, Minton shortened his stride to take pressure off his knee. The new delivery gave Minton a 92-mph sinker that batters were unable to drive. Minton went three full seasons (269 innings) without allowing a home run until John Stearns homered against him on May 2, 1982. This is the longest such streak in the post-1920 live-ball era.
